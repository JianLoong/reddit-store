Saw a similar post a while back and thought I'd throw my hat in since I am genuinely wondering.\n\nMyself and my husband (40s F&M) have been hosting Christmas for a few years. There's a lot of mental illness in both sides of our family so we are pretty low contact, but we host because none of the other family members have a big enough house for everyone to fit thanks to the above, and poor financial decisions. We don't even have a huge house, just big enough for us and the kids, but it's still the biggest space available to them.\n\nSo every year, we spend a week (while still working full time, because neither of us can afford any time off) cleaning the house and getting ready and buying groceries for the Christmas meal. Every year, we get no help. My mother used to cook but started refusing to during COVID because \"she cooked for 20+ years for Christmas and has had enough\". They brought some small platters once and the in-laws brought turkey, but nobody else in the family likes turkey (yes, we're weird and European) so they just sat there and sulked that they were the only ones eating it. Someone will complain about the food every time, that there's not enough or too much of X and not enough of Y, or why didn't we get Z, and why do they have to bring their own drinks this year, on and on. The children only eat mac and cheese or chicken nuggets and refuse to eat or throw a fit if we don't have any, so we have to make those too. I have to entertain the children because everyone else just ignores them. We end up broke, with our house trashed and our kids miserable and throwing tantrums because the others are too, and all around it's just not a fun experience.\n\nSo hubby is over it, he's refusing to host this year, he doesn't even want to go out or visit anyone on the day, he just wants to have a dinner with us and our kids, and I am pretty much in agreeance. It's just so much work and such a miserable experience but the parents are all guilting us and complaining that nobody will help clean their house or cook so they can have it there. I said they can have Christmas wherever they like but we would like a year off having to do any work or going anywhere; they're telling me we are AHs because Christmas is about family and I shouldn't let other people's negative attitudes get in the way of having a nice time with family. I should ignore the complaints and just suck it up for the sake of the kids (who don't enjoy it anyway) and family time. It's only once a year and I should \"rise above\" my own resentments.

Everyone chips in on the hall and dinner and had and a group goes early each year for set up and cooking. Men and women!!! You can rotate yearly. Who does cooking the later crowd that shows up finishes up. It was very smooth. And the best - paper plates and solo cups!!  Ex.

I was just telling my daughter that sometimes people need a break from one another and that is fine. \n  In my family my parents and in-laws didn't get along so we would alternate which household we celebrated with on actual Christmas. The other family we would celebrate a different day. The parents who didn't get Christmas day threw a little fit at first but everyone grew to like it over time. The grandparents got to have private time with their grandkids. And the grandkids got their gifts without having to compete with other grandparent's or Santa's gifts. Nothing is as big a bummer as when you spend $X dollars on gifts but the person you gifted it too is too busy playing with their other gifts to notice what got them. \n  Also we would go out to eat instead of slaving in a hot kitchen for hours and people being full in 15 minutes after you worked so hard. Both of the grandmothers' were raised that women do all the work and that was just how it was, all the time. So actually not having to cook all day was a shock but a good one. In giving them a break they would bring a few favorite  Christmas goodies because they actually wanted too instead of feeling obligated and instead of stressing over the menu. And because they had a break last year, the next year they would be happy to host. I started hosting after we had kids (after 7 years of marriage) when they started seeing us as adults and not children. We got married at 19. We are currently (52f) and (51m).\n  We still alternated for years with my brother also once he got married but Mom was no longer able to host. She unfortunately had health issues. \n Then Covid blew everything up and we saw no one for years. Then after the worst of Covid was over all of our parents died of different causes rather quickly. My fil had died 10 years earlier. We lost the other three within a year of each other. That was hard. The reason I told you this last part is for my last piece of advice. Yes, absolutely take your break this year and any other year you need it. But don't let it become permanent. Nothing is guaranteed and believe it or not you will miss them.

If it is important to your family, they will work with you, not against you.", "NTA everyone deserve a quiet time when they need one.\nFor this year, we found a cottage with fireplace in the mountain, we joyfully booked it when in details it says no wifi and cellular service \ud83e\udd21 it will be just us and our dog, perfect, we r so excited for xmas this year unlike any other years.\n\nYes, we are not going to watch any -cabin in the woods- horror movies before going", "NTA.  I\u2019ve never been able to just stay home and enjoy my life on Christmas, it\u2019s always \u201clet\u2019s get going so we can sit on a couch and be bored!\u201d situation.  I WISH my MIL would cancel Xmas this year.", "Oh wow. That sounds like a lot. The first time this started happening, I would never host Christmas again. Everyone is complaint but no one wants to pitch in. And instead of offering to help so it\u2019s easier on you all, they make you feel bad. \n\nNTA, it\u2019s time you get a fun Christmas for once.", "NTA  you deserve peace and boundaries you dont owe anyone your home or time or money ( execpt kids)   and its almost 2 months still till xmas so its not like its last minute.", "NTA.  They only want you to overlook everything because they don't want to have to cook.  Do NOT continue to provide outside of your ability for people who don't respect you or your home.  Family or not....respect is still expected when you are putting out 100% of the money and providing the location.  If it becomes a burden it isn't worth it.", "Not the AH", "NTA. It\u2019s your home, no one else has the right to bully you into using your home. If they don\u2019t like it, they can find an Airbnb and do it there, or not do it at all.", "They\u2019re right. Christmas is about family. So you should do right by *your* family and take a year off to actually enjoy the holiday together.", "NTA", "NTA.  They have some nerve complaining no one would come help clean up the home - uh, duh - they don't help clean YOUR home.", "That was us for years and this year when the messages came in about Christmas we said we didn\u2019t know what we are doing but we won\u2019t be hosting. Usual replies about it being too much hard work for them, too stressful, etc. \n\nLiterally read them singing \u2018honey, I don\u2019t care\u2019 in my head! (Line from baby, I don\u2019t care by transvision vamps).", "NTA!! Never feel guilty for protecting your family from toxic situations. Think of the amazing day your kids will have this year with just their bros/sis & parents. The happy memories you\u2019ll make & photos you can take of people smiling. That\u2019s priceless & honestly worth being called the A by people who have disrespected you & taken you for granted. \n\nGo ahead & have an intimate day of happiness & laughter with the ones you love.", "NTA - They sure are entitled little cretins aren't they...\n\nIf you feel obligated, which you very much shouldn't, and petty (which I wouldn't blame you) make an itemized list of all costs including labor for the shipping, cooking, and cleaning)(don't forget to include stat pay! ) And then everything someone complain a tell them you'd be happy to... for a price \ud83d\ude07", "NTA. It\u2019s your home. You can choose to invite others or not. Having done so in the past does NOT obligate you to do it in the future. Other family can offer to help the parents prep\u2026or not, their choice. Heck, y\u2019all can choose to go out of town for Christmas if you want. Yes, Christmas is ideally a family time, but not when the family is consistently imposing on one part of the family with no reciprocation. You could own a mansion with servants and it still wouldn\u2019t obligate you to host.", "No definitely not the asshole.  Every year we drive 7+ hours each way, pay like close to a thousand dollars in hotel fees traveling around, nearly died in a blizzard last year going off the road several times with my little girl in the car.  All to make our families happy.  This year I will not be going anywhere.  We will be celebrating Christmas privately and anyone who wants to call can video chat with us.", "NTA. Your family sucks and his family sucks. Your family meaning you, your husband, and kids are the only ones that matter. They take advantage of you both, trash the house, complain, and just sulk because they don\u2019t get their way. Oh well on them. Christmas is suppose to be beautiful and if your kids and husband aren\u2019t happy either, don\u2019t let it be done at your house anymore. There\u2019s no reason to stress, go broke, and suffer because people you are hosting (which is suppose to be family that cares) are absolutely terrible.", "NTA. They're guilt-tripping you and saying family is what matters most? Well then they can by all means do so themselves. It's for family, isn't it? \n\nNah they're ungrateful moochers who don't give so much as a thank you. Enjoy your Christmas with the people who appreciate you most.", "NTA. Christmas is about relaxing, and enjoying family. If it's neither of those two things, what's the point?", "Seems very convenient for your mother to try and guilt trip you for not caving to other people's wants and needs. She clearly set a Christmas boundary that she expects others to respect. Rather than show empathy she's contributing to your resentment.\n\nChristmas should also be about doing what's right for you and your immediate family. Putting yourself in debt and adding additional stress during an already stressful time of year? Nope. Take care of yourself.\n\nNTA", "\"I shouldn't let other people's negative attitudes get in the way of having a nice time with family.\" \n\nBut.... The negative attitudes are coming from your family and you don't seem to be having a nice time.... NTA.", "Absolutely you are NTA. Enjoy a quiet Christmas with your family and don't look back.  My husband and I started doing so years ago and love it.  It is just the 2 of us and our fur baby and it is wonderful.  We spend the day laying around,  opening a gift,  watching a movie,  opening another gift,  eating something,  having something yummy to drink,  opening another gift and finally finishing with stockings around 9 at night.  It's awesome and family has finally gotten used to it.", "OP try this - \"Yes, Christmas is for family and this year we want to spend our time concentrating on our family.\"", "Then let your Mil step up and host.  She claims it's not as bad as you think huh then she can have all that fun in hosting. If the place is too small that's ok that just means everyone gets be in one room, and people get to watch their own kids since there not much room for them to get away from their kids. \n\nDon't feel  bad in not wanting to host. They got on just fine all those years when you didn't host. They can survive it again doing their own plans without you guys again.\n\nDon't allow your self to be gaslight. Just keep telling everyone NO.", "Everyone has a good time because they don\u2019t have to deal with it after for no appreciation. Of course THEY have a good time.", "Then your mom can host since it's all about family right", "It's time you step down permanently from hosting. You and your husband and children are all miserable. \n\nStop putting yourself and them through all of this. The guest are ungrateful. You deserve to have a nice relaxing Christmas with your family. \n\n\nLet everyone else start doing their own things. They did it before they can do it again. Don't be allow your self to be miserable for another year. Just keep saying NO to them. If they don't like they can step up and host.", "My kid is always with his dad from the 23rd until the 30th, so I do Christmas for my family around the 20th. Which means that my Christmas Day is spent with my sister in my massive bed, in our comfiest pajamas, with a mountain of snacks and two freshly cooked lobsters, watching Die Hard. We eat too much, drink too much, swear too much, laugh too much, and quote every single line to eachother. \n\nIt's the fucking best. Fully on board with doing what you want on Christmas Day. Because if you can't do it then, when the fuck can you?", "It's so easy to say they can find another place to spend Christmas. But what happens when they just show up at the door empty-handed? I could see that happening with some people I know.", "\"They brought a jar of Mr. Peanut peanuts. \" this made me chuckle. When I was a kid our church had a potluck every couple of months. One person would invariably bring a jar of pickles. Just in the jar, didn't even bother to put them in a little bowl. It was a running gag in our family for years whenever anyone cheaped out."]}
