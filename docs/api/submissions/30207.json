Saw a similar post a while back and thought I'd throw my hat in since I am genuinely wondering.\n\nMyself and my husband (40s F&M) have been hosting Christmas for a few years. There's a lot of mental illness in both sides of our family so we are pretty low contact, but we host because none of the other family members have a big enough house for everyone to fit thanks to the above, and poor financial decisions. We don't even have a huge house, just big enough for us and the kids, but it's still the biggest space available to them.\n\nSo every year, we spend a week (while still working full time, because neither of us can afford any time off) cleaning the house and getting ready and buying groceries for the Christmas meal. Every year, we get no help. My mother used to cook but started refusing to during COVID because \"she cooked for 20+ years for Christmas and has had enough\". They brought some small platters once and the in-laws brought turkey, but nobody else in the family likes turkey (yes, we're weird and European) so they just sat there and sulked that they were the only ones eating it. Someone will complain about the food every time, that there's not enough or too much of X and not enough of Y, or why didn't we get Z, and why do they have to bring their own drinks this year, on and on. The children only eat mac and cheese or chicken nuggets and refuse to eat or throw a fit if we don't have any, so we have to make those too. I have to entertain the children because everyone else just ignores them. We end up broke, with our house trashed and our kids miserable and throwing tantrums because the others are too, and all around it's just not a fun experience.\n\nSo hubby is over it, he's refusing to host this year, he doesn't even want to go out or visit anyone on the day, he just wants to have a dinner with us and our kids, and I am pretty much in agreeance. It's just so much work and such a miserable experience but the parents are all guilting us and complaining that nobody will help clean their house or cook so they can have it there. I said they can have Christmas wherever they like but we would like a year off having to do any work or going anywhere; they're telling me we are AHs because Christmas is about family and I shouldn't let other people's negative attitudes get in the way of having a nice time with family. I should ignore the complaints and just suck it up for the sake of the kids (who don't enjoy it anyway) and family time. It's only once a year and I should \"rise above\" my own resentments.

Everyone can chip in for a hall to rent and food to cater.  No? Then they can be quiet and eat at home. In my case.  I cancelled thanksgiving.  Like you. I get stuck feeding a large group. My sister stays a week. Doesn\u2019t help with anything.  My mom is starting dementia and can\u2019t be trusted around the stove.  My brother doesn\u2019t like our sister. I pay for all food and activities and we are exhausted by end of week. So this week I said we are staying home and no one is visiting.  Period.  I\u2019m so relieved.  I just rinse and repeat.

For over 20 years there were 2 big family celebrations. My husband passed away and everybody just disappeared from my life including my family apparently they loved him more than me. Now we have christmas dinner just me,my kids and my brother and sister. Also my youngest grandsons father. Then usually my other grandsons come over in the afternoon cause they have lots of family to visit. And it is the most amazing thing we are so much happier so you do what makes you happy. You deserve it", "Sounds like adult family meeting time. Requirement or can\u2019t come to Christmas period! I really do understand and also understand mother not doing it anymore. My mom did it for sooo many years and loved it but had enough. My family was one where after and some before always pitched in with everything after dinner and till everyone was gone. It\u2019s the respectful thing that shouldn\u2019t need to be spoken. If not shame on them! That is so disrespectful!! If everyone wanted something different bring it after you make it at home absolute if they don\u2019t even offer to help with food. Dinner not dessert! Like I always said I\u2019m not making everyone whatever they want. One meal and everyone eats it. Sure there are times when it happens because it keeps people happy. But when you\u2019re talking about that many people with extended family that is completely unacceptable to even ask. I don\u2019t like most everything but am 57 and never once asked anything of anyone for something I like. It\u2019s rude!!  My exes family always rented a hall with a kitchen on a weekend day before Christmas and it worked out great. I know it went on for 20+ years. That may be a good idea for your bunch. Everyone chips in on the hall and dinner and had and a group goes early each year for set up and cooking. Men and women!!! You can rotate yearly. Who does cooking the later crowd that shows up finishes up. It was very smooth. And the best - paper plates and solo cups!!  Ex. The older ones would pay for most of dinner foods but younger parents a little along with getting (yes shopping) for pop juice and everyone brought a side dish or dessert. (You may want to assign that unless you want all desserts). It\u2019s just so simple. It was all day people come and leave but you\u2019re free on Christmas for your family and yourself and your house doesn\u2019t need a thing and no mess left!  Sorry so long but this really was a great situation for everyone! And it wasn\u2019t at all a fancy place! Cement walls tables chairs and a kitchen. That\u2019s all you need!  If you would like anymore info let me know cuz I\u2019m happy to help!", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility. If they feel that way about Christmas and being about family and rising above then they should rise above their own issues about cleaning and space and do it themselves.

They sound like a chore", "Absolutely NTA, and you are My People!  The pressure, the time, the money, the complaining, the fits, the entitlement.... this is not fun and not what the holidays are supposed to be about.  You have your own kids and your own family to worry about. Eff everyone else, after all of the past years of their whining and lack of help and zero appreciation.  \n\nIf it helps, my husband and I have not done family Thanksgiving for the past few years. We used Covid as an excuse for a while but finally admitted last year that we just don't want to deal with it.  And we could not be happier with our decision.

Screw those people!!! \n\nLastly, there\u2019s nothing at all wrong with not liking turkey. Most Americans don\u2019t like turkey. They just eat it because everyone else does. Same goes for dressing, pumpkin pie and all the other \u201ctraditional\u201d garbage.  Afterwards they lie and talk about how good it was and how much they enjoyed it. \n\nIf people actually enjoyed eating all that crap, it would be on the menu at all of the chain restaurants.

You didn\u2019t even have to explain. I knew where this was going. I think your husband has an awesome idea. Tell them to try again maybe Thanksgiving.

They won't stay kids forever, and the only core memories they'll end up holding from Christmas will be resentful ones.\n\nHave your own Christmas, the way YOU want to, with your family and make some wonderful new traditions.", "NTA \n\nThey're all hypocrites! They wanna complain about how no one will help them or clean and such. But they dont do that for you anyway!\n\nThat fact that all of you, your family and all of theirs are struggling financially should give them all a reason to contribute something. Not expect you to provide everything.\n\nThey've used and abused your generosity time and time again since you started hosting.

No is a complete sentence. \u201cWe\u2019re not hosting this year\u201d is also a complete sentence. Say it this year, say it again next year. Keep saying it forever.

No matter what your reasons are, you are entitled to a peaceful family Christmas. It's ok to want this.", "NTA I was in your shoes a few years ago. I stuck to it and yes the first year I had A LOT of guilt, arguments, and animosity but since then they have accepted it. Stay strong!", "NTA, Christmas IS about family, YOUR family! You, hubby and the kids are family! Ditch the relatives and celebrate YOUR way! We gave up on our relatives once and for all four years ago, they didn't respect us or our needs. My husband is diabetic but they moved dinner two hours without letting us now before we left home, we would have eaten an extra meal if they had only told us. They also took away the only kid friendly dishes without telling us (we specifically asked if we should bring something but were told no).

I begged my Mom to stop wanting elaborate Christmas dinners. Hubs and I already hosted brekkie for anyone who wanted to come. We did not want a big dinner. We (the rest of the family collectively) wanted nibbles, cocktails and family time. It just didn't fly with her. When she passed (end of a November) we had one last biggish dinner to honour her memory and ever since then it has been more of a potluck affair. Admittedly for the last decade or so my mom was around, people did bring dishes to share, but it was just so elaborate.

I am in the same boat except 4 out of 5 holidays are celebrated at my home, and I'm over it!!!! My husband doesn't want to do it anymore and I agree!

Has not spent the last week preparing.  And will not spend the following week cleaning up.  They don't care what the kids get into and possibly break.  You are he ones hosting so all complaints, intentionally directed at you or not, are felt by you.  Everything good or bad feels like a judgement of your party, and therefore you.\n\nYou are, in the neck of your mind, thinking about all this the entire time.  So you are unable to just enjoy it.\n\nMaybe I am projecting to much of myself into it here.  But this is exactly how I would feel.\n\nMIL might be telling the truth.  People have different experiences at the same event.  Some people love the chaos of kids running around 'having fun'.  While you see the kid that is getting bullied and not having a good time.  Some people honestly don't think of thier complaints as, well, complaints.  That's just then pointing out facts while you are taking it to heart as something you could have done better.\n\nIf you're not enjoying it, don't do it. Be polite but don't equivocate.  Don't leave anything open to interpretation.  Personally I have an easier time telling someone I can't do something due to reasons, rather than I just don't want to.  That leaves things open to argument.

They have the same pants to get glad in that they got mad in!! As far as the kids go, stop somewhere on Christmas Eve and get a couple of 20 piece nuggets & Mac-n-cheese from Arby's or wherever put in the fridge and warm it up for them. EVERYONE eats on paper plates so cuts down on dishes. Paper cups for water if they don't want to bring their own beverages. Put \"fast & hard\" hours and stick to it, for example everyone shows at 1:00 & LEAVES by 3:00, no exceptions!! \n\nI'm willing to bet that nobody will want to come over after that so your free to have your own Christmas from there on out. It really sucks when others have no appreciation for what others do for them. You are definitely NOT TA! I don't know if you drink or not, but if so, at 3:15 you and your husband can sit back and have a glad if wine and toast to hosting your last Christmas dinner. \ud83d\ude09  Good luck to you and I hope y'all have a Very Merry Christmas!!"]}
