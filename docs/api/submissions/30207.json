Saw a similar post a while back and thought I'd throw my hat in since I am genuinely wondering.\n\nMyself and my husband (40s F&M) have been hosting Christmas for a few years. There's a lot of mental illness in both sides of our family so we are pretty low contact, but we host because none of the other family members have a big enough house for everyone to fit thanks to the above, and poor financial decisions. We don't even have a huge house, just big enough for us and the kids, but it's still the biggest space available to them.\n\nSo every year, we spend a week (while still working full time, because neither of us can afford any time off) cleaning the house and getting ready and buying groceries for the Christmas meal. Every year, we get no help. My mother used to cook but started refusing to during COVID because \"she cooked for 20+ years for Christmas and has had enough\". They brought some small platters once and the in-laws brought turkey, but nobody else in the family likes turkey (yes, we're weird and European) so they just sat there and sulked that they were the only ones eating it. Someone will complain about the food every time, that there's not enough or too much of X and not enough of Y, or why didn't we get Z, and why do they have to bring their own drinks this year, on and on. The children only eat mac and cheese or chicken nuggets and refuse to eat or throw a fit if we don't have any, so we have to make those too. I have to entertain the children because everyone else just ignores them. We end up broke, with our house trashed and our kids miserable and throwing tantrums because the others are too, and all around it's just not a fun experience.\n\nSo hubby is over it, he's refusing to host this year, he doesn't even want to go out or visit anyone on the day, he just wants to have a dinner with us and our kids, and I am pretty much in agreeance. It's just so much work and such a miserable experience but the parents are all guilting us and complaining that nobody will help clean their house or cook so they can have it there. I said they can have Christmas wherever they like but we would like a year off having to do any work or going anywhere; they're telling me we are AHs because Christmas is about family and I shouldn't let other people's negative attitudes get in the way of having a nice time with family. I should ignore the complaints and just suck it up for the sake of the kids (who don't enjoy it anyway) and family time. It's only once a year and I should \"rise above\" my own resentments.

I think even if I waver, he will be the one putting his foot down.", "Ah, well if I ignore them while they're here, then that totally gives me the same outcomes according to them, and I don't have to cancel Christmas that way /eyeroll, heavy /s. I'm starting to see how specious their arguments are.", "I agree with this. Christmas is 100% about family. But that doesn't mean that you have to be the sacrificial lamb each year so the family can be together.\n\nIf its important to them to get together, let all of them figure it out.\n\nRight now, focus on YOUR family. Your husband. Your kids. As I'm finding out with a kido not far off from HS Graduation, you only have a finite number of years to build special memories with your kids. Do not squander them trying to people please.", "Yes, this was my experience for 10 years or so, but moving back, the expectation is so high.", "I moved away for a while and we did Christmas just me and my husband, sometimes friends, for so long, I missed family. But it's just been miserable like this since we moved back and I miss the quiet Christmases. It's funny how I never realised how good it was and spent the whole time longing for exactly what I have now, and I'm hating it now!", "We did try a pot luck, that was when the Turkey Incident occurred. They brought turkey, a couple of platters of fruit and cut celery and carrots and things, and we supplied the rest, a lot of people went hungry though because we thought they were bringing more, and I felt bad for not asking exactly what they were bringing.", "They are for sure taking advantage. Let them figure it out for a year.", "Misery loves company. If everyone is miserable, they feel less bad about being miserable themselves. Don't let up, they set their table, you enjoy your stress free dinner. NTA", "It's time for your kids to gleefully await Christmas again, instead of dreading it. When you get to see how happy they are the closer it gets, you'll lose all doubt as to whether or not you made the right decision.", ">Christmas is about family and I shouldn't let other people's negative attitudes get in the way of having a nice time with family.\n\nYou should absolutely quote this back to them and let them know that you're focusing on having a nice time with your nuclear family and not letting other people's negative attitudes get in the way of that nice time. NTA, and happy upcoming holidays!", "but *you* are not having a good time doing all this. you're allowed to enjoy the event you host.", "Then tell her that you agree that family can do it, and you're more than willing to host, but only after *everyone* *else* has hosted. \n\nShe won't try to call the bluff because no one else will offer to host, and even if they do, that buys you *years* of not having to worry about it.", "Yes, it's incredibly exhausting and you have to clean and shop and pay for and make the food that you get complaints about. Then you have to clean again.", "Switch to cookies and cocoa on Christmas Eve. No dinner. Just cookies, cocoa and a visit.", "Yeah in that case cancel Christmas but invite the one who cooked for everyone for 20 yrs because they\u2019re not wrong - they did their time and after just a few years you know what they went through. ;)", "Exactly. The in laws helped clean up the wrapping paper rubbish one year but we still had to do all the dishes.", "Wow, usually it's expected for family to help clean up the kitchen, do dishes, put away food, etc."]}
