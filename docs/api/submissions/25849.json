Recently my cousin Mia (19f) came to live with us for 1-2 year because her parents are going through some issues. We both have good relation we get along nice and we even play outdoor games and also video games so we spend alot of time together. The issue is that she started dressing very immodestly. I know it may sound like I am controlling or something but no she is literally wearing very less clothes. For ex she just wears underwear/panties and oversized teashirt or hoodies and roam are the house or watches tv in living room. Last night she was just wearing a freaking tank top which was mine so it was bigger in size but she said she liked it so i gave it to her, she was just wearing that tank top and I can visibly see her entire left boob and it made me really uncomfortable. After that I straight up told her that she need wear more appropriate clothes around the house which led to an argument that I am trying to be controlling jerk and etc etc. I talked with my mother about this and she said my cousin is going through issue because of her parents seperation and i should cut her some slack.

Big difference between nudity and booty shorts and a tank top", "Irrespective of gender, some people might not feel comfortable seeing private parts of people. It's not even about sexualizing. It is uncomfortable. So OP you have every right to voice it out.\n\nHowever, there's no right and perfect way of communicating this without sounding like controlling or sexualizing the whole thing.\n\nOnly solution is let her be and stay away from her. Talk to her when you need to..", "Yall In the comments voting Y T A. Yes people can wear  what she wants but she wearing no pants around family in the house! Her cousin could see her boob.. It's inappropriate.\n\nOP is NTA. He is allowed to feel uncomfortable.", "NTA. When I was a girl of around 15-16 yo my brother\u2019s friends always stayed at our place and usually slept and walked around in underwear. They were approximately 17-18 yo. \n\nI can tell you I got fed up of watching them walking around my house like that. It was uncomfortable mainly because there\u2019s no way you can avoid watching that scene unless you lock yourself up at your own home.\n\nI didn\u2019t sexualize them, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t give a flying F about them but I didn\u2019t like to see asses and dick shapes every weekend.

This is ridiculous and certainly OP is understandably uncomfortable and has more of a claim to be in his parents house than his cousin.", "It\u2019s complicated. She lives there now so it\u2019s her safe place. And she should be allowed to do stuff like that. I mean where else should she do it? In school or what?

If ur uncomfortable you could have said do you mind wearing something less seethrough or something. She was most likely unaware that you could see her whole tit through clothes or that it slipped out. And it is now her home to temporarily. She wears long tops right? And there only seems to be one occasion where it was a real issue. So you could have addressed that instead of the way she wears clothes to relax around the house genraly. Being uncomfortable is all well and good and understandable but you have literally no right to tell her or judge how she should or should not dress.

If it were your male cousin, this post wouldn't even have been made.\n\nAnd let me add one more thing to this comment, and then I'll stop because it's becoming exhausting to explain something so basic. It should be simple: men should have control over where they direct their gaze. The burden of appeasing a man's discomfort should not be placed on women. There are four other directions to look in, and I suggest starting to do just that.", "YTA. Don't look if it's a problem for you. You don't get to decide what other people wear.

Recently my cousin Mia (19f) came to live with us for 1-2 year because her parents are going through some issues. We both have good relation we get along nice and we even play outdoor games and also video games so we spend alot of time together. The issue is that she started dressing very immodestly. I know it may sound like I am controlling or something but no she is literally wearing very less clothes. For ex she just wears underwear/panties and oversized teashirt or hoodies and roam are the house or watches tv in living room. Last night she was just wearing a freaking tank top which was mine so it was bigger in size but she said she liked it so i gave it to her, she was just wearing that tank top and I can visibly see her entire left boob and it made me really uncomfortable. After that I straight up told her that she need wear more appropriate clothes around the house which led to an argument that I am trying to be controlling jerk and etc etc. I talked with my mother about this and she said my cousin is going through issue because of her parents seperation and i should cut her some slack. So was I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And with a bigger size tank top as OP describes, I'm going to assume that he doesn't mean \"I can see its shape through the clothing\" (plus it wouldn't make sense that only one was showing that way).\n\nAs for the bathing suit argument: He isn't at a pool or at the beach, he is at home. When you go to the pool or the beach, there is an expectation that you will see people in bathing suits. If you stay at home, it's not a reasonable expectation that you encounter people in underwear unless you subscribe to the idea that there is no obligation to dress somewhat appropriately or that having your breasts not covered by clothing is still somehow appropriate.\n\nI'm actually split on that one because women's breasts are overly sexualized and as a result, women have way stricter clothing obligations. On the other hand, if anyone would tell me or any man that they don't wanna see their chest uncovered in their own home, I'd say that's a reasonable request unless it's way too hot.\n\nAs for the \"ask her, but don't tell her how to dress\" argument, I'd wager people expect that to be a rhetorical question. As in, if the cousin just said no, she'd probably be considered an asshole to a minor extent.

That's not what is happening here, though, and he kinda just needs to deal with it. I don't think this is really an issue where anyone is in the wrong, it's just incompatibility and normally you'd resolve the issue by not being around each other, but seeing as how they are both staying in someone else's home, and that person has given her answer, he kinda has to just suck it up.
