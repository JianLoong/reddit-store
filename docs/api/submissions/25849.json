We both have good relation we get along nice and we even play outdoor games and also video games so we spend alot of time together. The issue is that she started dressing very immodestly. I know it may sound like I am controlling or something but no she is literally wearing very less clothes. For ex she just wears underwear/panties and oversized teashirt or hoodies and roam are the house or watches tv in living room. Last night she was just wearing a freaking tank top which was mine so it was bigger in size but she said she liked it so i gave it to her, she was just wearing that tank top and I can visibly see her entire left boob and it made me really uncomfortable. After that I straight up told her that she need wear more appropriate clothes around the house which led to an argument that I am trying to be controlling jerk and etc etc. I talked with my mother about this and she said my cousin is going through issue because of her parents seperation and i should cut her some slack.

Big difference between nudity and booty shorts and a tank top", "Irrespective of gender, some people might not feel comfortable seeing private parts of people. It's not even about sexualizing. It is uncomfortable. So OP you have every right to voice it out.\n\nHowever, there's no right and perfect way of communicating this without sounding like controlling or sexualizing the whole thing.\n\nOnly solution is let her be and stay away from her.

When I was a girl of around 15-16 yo my brother\u2019s friends always stayed at our place and usually slept and walked around in underwear. They were approximately 17-18 yo. \n\nI can tell you I got fed up of watching them walking around my house like that. It was uncomfortable mainly because there\u2019s no way you can avoid watching that scene unless you lock yourself up at your own home.\n\nI didn\u2019t sexualize them, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t give a flying F about them but I didn\u2019t like to see asses and dick shapes every weekend.

She was most likely unaware that you could see her whole tit through clothes or that it slipped out. And it is now her home to temporarily. She wears long tops right? And there only seems to be one occasion where it was a real issue. So you could have addressed that instead of the way she wears clothes to relax around the house genraly.

Recently my cousin Mia (19f) came to live with us for 1-2 year because her parents are going through some issues. We both have good relation we get along nice and we even play outdoor games and also video games so we spend alot of time together. The issue is that she started dressing very immodestly. I know it may sound like I am controlling or something but no she is literally wearing very less clothes. For ex she just wears underwear/panties and oversized teashirt or hoodies and roam are the house or watches tv in living room. Last night she was just wearing a freaking tank top which was mine so it was bigger in size but she said she liked it so i gave it to her, she was just wearing that tank top and I can visibly see her entire left boob and it made me really uncomfortable. After that I straight up told her that she need wear more appropriate clothes around the house which led to an argument that I am trying to be controlling jerk and etc etc. I talked with my mother about this and she said my cousin is going through issue because of her parents seperation and i should cut her some slack.

And with a bigger size tank top as OP describes, I'm going to assume that he doesn't mean \"I can see its shape through the clothing\" (plus it wouldn't make sense that only one was showing that way).\n\nAs for the bathing suit argument: He isn't at a pool or at the beach, he is at home. When you go to the pool or the beach, there is an expectation that you will see people in bathing suits. If you stay at home, it's not a reasonable expectation that you encounter people in underwear unless you subscribe to the idea that there is no obligation to dress somewhat appropriately or that having your breasts not covered by clothing is still somehow appropriate.\n\nI'm actually split on that one because women's breasts are overly sexualized and as a result, women have way stricter clothing obligations. On the other hand, if anyone would tell me or any man that they don't wanna see their chest uncovered in their own home, I'd say that's a reasonable request unless it's way too hot.\n\nAs for the \"ask her, but don't tell her how to dress\" argument, I'd wager people expect that to be a rhetorical question.
