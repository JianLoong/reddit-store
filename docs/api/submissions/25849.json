Recently my cousin Mia (19f) came to live with us for 1-2 year because her parents are going through some issues. We both have good relation we get along nice and we even play outdoor games and also video games so we spend alot of time together. The issue is that she started dressing very immodestly. I know it may sound like I am controlling or something but no she is literally wearing very less clothes. For ex she just wears underwear/panties and oversized teashirt or hoodies and roam are the house or watches tv in living room. Last night she was just wearing a freaking tank top which was mine so it was bigger in size but she said she liked it so i gave it to her, she was just wearing that tank top and I can visibly see her entire left boob and it made me really uncomfortable. After that I straight up told her that she need wear more appropriate clothes around the house which led to an argument that I am trying to be controlling jerk and etc etc. I talked with my mother about this and she said my cousin is going through issue because of her parents seperation and i should cut her some slack.

When I was a girl of around 15-16 yo my brother\u2019s friends always stayed at our place and usually slept and walked around in underwear. They were approximately 17-18 yo. \n\nI can tell you I got fed up of watching them walking around my house like that. It was uncomfortable mainly because there\u2019s no way you can avoid watching that scene unless you lock yourself up at your own home.\n\nI didn\u2019t sexualize them, \u2018cause I didn\u2019t give a flying F about them but I didn\u2019t like to see asses and dick shapes every weekend.

She was most likely unaware that you could see her whole tit through clothes or that it slipped out. And it is now her home to temporarily. She wears long tops right? And there only seems to be one occasion where it was a real issue. So you could have addressed that instead of the way she wears clothes to relax around the house genraly. Being uncomfortable is all well and good and understandable but you have literally no right to tell her or judge how she should or should not dress.

Recently my cousin Mia (19f) came to live with us for 1-2 year because her parents are going through some issues. We both have good relation we get along nice and we even play outdoor games and also video games so we spend alot of time together. The issue is that she started dressing very immodestly. I know it may sound like I am controlling or something but no she is literally wearing very less clothes. For ex she just wears underwear/panties and oversized teashirt or hoodies and roam are the house or watches tv in living room. Last night she was just wearing a freaking tank top which was mine so it was bigger in size but she said she liked it so i gave it to her, she was just wearing that tank top and I can visibly see her entire left boob and it made me really uncomfortable. After that I straight up told her that she need wear more appropriate clothes around the house which led to an argument that I am trying to be controlling jerk and etc etc. I talked with my mother about this and she said my cousin is going through issue because of her parents seperation and i should cut her some slack. So was I the asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I agree with you. Boobs are essentially tools to keep a new born alive. The fact that straight men, lesbians and bi women are attracted to them is besides the point.

Boobs ARE overly sexualized and that kinda ties in with generationally controlling women's bodies and sexuality, is what I'm now realizing. So fair point.

If he is brainwashed by society and is looking at his cousin's breasts in a sexual way he wouldn't say anything and just continue looking.  \n\n\n In this case it makes him uncomfortable since its not decent. Same way as a man with his pubes poking out of his underpants is not decent and can make a person uncomfortable.  \n\n\nThis is a situation of respect and boundaries of both parties.

Did he deserve the hatred I've seen some people adress towards him? I don't think so either. What could have been a teaching moment for a young man is turned into an humiliation. The lad came here to sort it out, it went through his mind that he might be wrong, he was open to improving, and he was basically cast away as a mygonistic asshole that needs to be humiliated and berated. What do you think he'll learn from that?\nAnd I'd like to add that in SOME situation it is more accepted for men to be shirtless than for woman, but overall going shirtless is frowned upon, although I'll admit to a differenr degree between men and women. But simply stating that men can go shirtless while women can't is partially disingenuous.", "But heterosexual women are not aroused by male nipples the way heterosexual men are aroused by BOOBS. I mean, come on. BOOBS. And I'm saying this as a woman. We don't need anatomy class to understand the difference, we need common sense. My brothers don't tell me to cover up if I happen to wear a tank top with no bra or a skimpy night dress once in a while in front of them but I don't usually hang out on the couch with them half naked in my underwear.

She's not necessarily wearing anything other than boxer shorts or boy pants (very fashionable) as underwear/sleepwear. His issue is with the boobs.", "It doesn't sound like the tank top is transparent, so seeing an entire boob would mean that it is, in fact, NOT covered. Things cannot be covered by clothes and simultaneously seen unless the clothing is transparent. And with a bigger size tank top as OP describes, I'm going to assume that he doesn't mean \"I can see its shape through the clothing\" (plus it wouldn't make sense that only one was showing that way).\n\nAs for the bathing suit argument: He isn't at a pool or at the beach, he is at home. When you go to the pool or the beach, there is an expectation that you will see people in bathing suits. If you stay at home, it's not a reasonable expectation that you encounter people in underwear unless you subscribe to the idea that there is no obligation to dress somewhat appropriately or that having your breasts not covered by clothing is still somehow appropriate.\n\nI'm actually split on that one because women's breasts are overly sexualized and as a result, women have way stricter clothing obligations. On the other hand, if anyone would tell me or any man that they don't wanna see their chest uncovered in their own home, I'd say that's a reasonable request unless it's way too hot.\n\nAs for the \"ask her, but don't tell her how to dress\" argument, I'd wager people expect that to be a rhetorical question. As in, if the cousin just said no, she'd probably be considered an asshole to a minor extent. Which means in that case the voting should be ESH (not that you made the argument, it's just a tangent).", "OP said in one his comments that the nipple was showing", "It's more of less about the fact that he mentioned it made him uncomfortable. Also I don't think they were swimming. Does it show the same? Pretty much. Is it the same situation compared to another? Not really. I personally would just turn the air conditioning down if I don't want to be confrontational. The other route is just staying in his own room and politely letting her know that he doesn't really want to hang out with her anymore if she wears what she does. I'm not really trying to argue you with you here, but again, it's weird to me that someone opened their home to me, but I can't be respectful enough to wear a little more clothes so I didn't make others uncomfortable. I don't think it was super unreasonable to ask that. Then even more so, to get ANGRY. I sincerely hope it's just a lounging thing and not that she's trying to get OP's attention, because thats just gross. Sure I'm making a pretty big jump there, but anything is possible. \nAlso skin isn't a bad thing, but I don't see why she's pushing back so much on it when most people would agree, you don't go around in your skivvies if others ask you to put on something else in their own home as well.", "Yeah but you wouldn't keep looking at it would you? We are not talking about a one time glance, OPs cousin is literally doing it around the house all the time.\n\nAlso I think the reponse could have been handled better but it doesn't make OP the AH\n\nYou also said you did not like it!

And our British colleagues overheard \n\nThe first shock was that people don\u2019t wear swimsuit to sauna in Finland (which I reckon is the case only in the U.K. and the US) \n\nAnd second they accused her mum of child molestation because she was exposing herself naked to my colleague and she was forcing her to be naked in public. \n\nIt\u2019s been about 5 years and I still haven\u2019t come to terms with this ridiculously stupid take", "I'm not arguing a known social construct. I don't agree with it but you can't deny seeing a man topless at the beach is completely different than seeing a woman topless at the beach. Even if you don't care, it's still a very rare sight compared to a topless man. \nI live where it is completely legal and I disagree with sexualizing breasts. Doesn't change the current social attitudes of male and female nipples. \n\nTbh a better comparison is a man in a speedo because you aren't seeing genitals but it still is seen as fairly taboo socially to see that much body on a male.", "Unfortunately this world isn't 'equal'  I never said it was 'equal' but rather, a better comparison. \n\nI can also say an orange needs to be peeled and an apple doesn't have to be. I can't compare apples and oranges. \n\nAs much as I'd love equality to be the answer to OP, it's not. They both live in a house and need to respect their roommates boundaries. Those boundaries are formed by social expectations and personal experiences. You can't ignore that and call body theory. I'll defend equality in toplessness to the ends of the earth.

Has anyone pushed?

Obviously, not all the time, some women actually do what they preach.

You're right, that's why I don't feel comfortable walking around my male cousins or actually any man showing skin. I'm actually very scared around them.
