You booked the trip after they made it clear to you, that you're not part of their life.\n\nI'm sorry to say that I don't think they're interested in rekindling a relationship with you that goes both ways. They need someone to answer questions for the kids - and maybe a free babysitter.\n\nIf they pay for the trip and you visit them,  they'll probably mention it many many times... So maybe just don't and surround yourself with people who value you. After all, \"the family we create is more important than the family we are born\", according to your brother, right?", "NTA.  The audacity of your brother!  So, you weren't family when it suited him, but now that he's getting questions from his kids, he's all about you being family?  That's ridiculous.  Go on the cruise, have a blast, and don't worry about your brother or his family.  He made his bed, and now he can lie in it.", "So he cuts you out of your life but now wants you to come for Christmas because he wants something from you. They both sound extremely entitled. The nerve, they never wanted you around but get upset because you don't drop what you're doing??!! You are so NTA. Go on your cruise and make memories. Family is not always blood, so surround yourself with people who love you for you and not what you can do for them.", "NTA. I suspect you wouldn't have booked the cruise if they hadn't been basically telling you that you aren't part of the family, plus they can always visit you outside of the holiday season if it is that important to them. Enjoy your cruise.", "NTA\n\nAs soon as your brother got what he needed out of you he'd dump you again. He is the one who treats family like sh!t, not you. \n\nChange your number. Your brother sucks. Go NC.\n\nSurround yourself with people who actually love and respect you. Your brother and his family do not love or respect you. You are just the exotic aunt.", "NTA, but after a point, I don't know why you were still trying to be apart of a group of people who don't want you there.", "NTA- why can\u2019t you visit another time? He\u2019s completely ignored you until now he can wait for a different timeframe.", "NTA... he decided to not include you in his and his family's life even though you tried numerous times... and now out of the blue, when his kids are interested in your culture it suddenly becomes important that you share with them....\n\nDon't give up your cruise and enjoy your trip... Tell them you are happy to spend time with them any other time if they are still interested...", "He only wants you when it suits him ! You\u2019d get the one visit to explain your heritage then he\u2019d blank you again . Don\u2019t be taken in .", "NTA\n\nDon't cancel the cruise. Have a really great time and don't worry about your brother. You shouldn't go running to him just because he decided to come calling.", "NTA\n\nLet's start with the offered explanation - you already booked the cruise and out of nowhere your brothers wife decides that they want you to come over for Christmas.  The Cruise is non refundable and if they wanted to spend time with you bad enough (out of nowhere), or really even felt like you were true family, they would make arrangements to meet with you before or after the cruise or pay the debt if they insist on a date during it.\n\nI really hate when people use \"family\" as an excuse to manipulate others that are related.  My mother and I were estranged for 25 years, due to her religion, until she was older and came to terms with just wanting to spend her time with family.\n\nFrom what you have outlined, your brother and his family went LC with you and have not wanted you over for any holidays until their \"children\" started questioning their heritage.  From what you wrote, it seems like your SIL is the one pushing to have you over to share your Heritage and Culture, NOT to actually spend quality 'family' time with them.  This isn't a family holiday get together, it is having you over to teach them what they cannot - nothing more.\n\nThis is me being the AH now - I would tell them no thanks, and that you are taking the cruise and they can hire a tutor for their children.  If they want to mend relationships then they can start by meeting with you alone to catch up and work out any issues that are on the table.", "You can't go to Christmas with them because you've already made plans. You declined gracefully. The end. No reason to tell your brother you can accommodate him if he covers your expenses. Just go on your trip and tell them you'd love to be included another time when you're given reasonable notice. Lots of people are making holiday plans for NEXT year right now.\n\nIf they want to spend time with you they will figure out how to not surprise you after ignoring your for years.\n\nNTA", "> I confronted him about it, and he gave me the whole \"the family we create is more important than the family we are born\" to lecture. I was just done so I hung up the phone.\n\nDid you remind him of this?\n\nI see he sold himself out for access to ytness, and now is trying to backpedal because his kids want actual culture.\n\nNTA for asking him to pay for your trip since he's also the one asking you to cancel it in order to come to his house, which isn't something he actually wants (based on his previous behavior).\n\nHonestly, he owes you a huge apology and *a lot* of sucking up/making ammends... but that'll only happen if you also believe you are owed those things. Good luck!", "NTA - Your brother repeatedly basically said that he didn't care about you being family. Has not invited you to any of his holiday events or any get togethers, but all of a sudden you are supposed to drop everything because all of a sudden \"we're family\"?! I'm sorry but fuck that mess. I mean I'm not saying you shouldn't see them or go NC (I'm sure ppl here will tell you that) but it doesn't have to be during the time of your trip. I would just say \"look for years I tried to be 'part of the family' as you want to say, but was told you had a family and didn't need me. So, I have made other plans for holidays this year. I can come next year or to something else that you have, but this year I will be on a cruise.\" And if he still stand by his your an AH or fine you're not part of the fam, then I mean not a big loss because he has been treating you like that for how ever many years anyway. He's the asshole for the way he's been treating you. You aren't the asshole here.", "NTA. He deprioritised you first and way harder. Why can't he just propose another time wtf", "NTA.  You'd already made plans and put down the money when he showed up with his offer, so he has no grounds to stand on.  It sounds like he just wanted to use you for the benefit of his kids anyway.", "NTA. Should have just said that you have plans out of the country already for Christmas, but getting together another time would be great.", "NTA. You deserve your vacation and brother obviously needs something now, even if it costs you your vacation and the cost of the trip. Why can't you visit two weeks later. Or maybe this week for Dewali,   or next November since they want to give them some Indian culture.", "NTA\n\nParticularly since their invitation seems very self serving.\n\nHowever from your comments it does seem like you really do want to have a closer familial relationship with them. In that light, no matter what their motives and how self-interested they are, this WAS a door opening. That\u2019s the only reason I think it may have been nice to handle the invitation a little differently. \n\nYou\u2019re still absolutely correct not to cancel your cruise, but saying \u201cI\u2019m not available on these dates, but I\u2019m really grateful for the invitation! What if I come over (insert dates that work for you here - maybe New Years or a weekend before the holidays?), would that work?\u201d may have kept the door open and been a way to access a relationship with them and their kids, which would probably lead to more invites. \n\nOf course, if you did do it this way and they insisted it was their time frame or nothing, or if you have reason to think they\u2019d suck you in with false intentions and then just snub you again, then you absolutely should stick to your firm no and spare yourself the hurt.", "NTA Sounds like he chose money over family when he wouldn't make you whole on your trip. Mind you, he never acted like you were family to begin with.", "Your brother acting like Devdas (weak and spineless) right before Diwali is a trip. NTA!", "WTF is wrong with your brother. He is extremely selfish to expect you to drop everything for him. But when you wanted to be part of the family, he ignored you. Just tell him the same thing he told you, \"the family we create is more important than the family we are born.\" \n\nNTA. Go on your cruise.  Make new friends. Who, knows, they will be better than your real family.", "NTA. Why don't they book tickets on your cruise and join you? Then he doesn't have to pay for your cruise AND his kids get a great experience with the Aunt.", "Whenever I read about the \"olive branch\" and young kids are involved, I think, \"free babysitting expected\".\n\nPlus, \"I practically banned you from my life but now that I deign to reach out,  just put your life on hold and come jump through these hoops.\"\nNTA. Go on your cruise and don't give them another thought", "So if this is face value than NTA and honesty girl why are you still talking to someone whose clearly so disinterested in having a relationship with you.

It really shouldn\u2019t be all or nothing for you as who\u2019s to say after you go they don\u2019t drop you again. \n\nI\u2019m all for reconnecting if he is the only family you have left, but who says it has to be exclusively on THEIR terms?", "Let's be clear: Dave cut off his ~~brother~~  sister because he wanted to cozy up to his new white family.  Sounds like he is disconnected or actively despises his heritage.  But now the kids are curious...and mommy and daddy now all of a sudden want OP back in.  Because otherwise the two of them look like whitewashing racists.\n\nIf both OP and Dave are American Indian, there's a term for Dave in that community: an \"apple\".", "I think the plan was for OP to stay with the kids for a few days \u201cteaching them their culture\u201d while bro and his wife go on a couples trip\u2026 If it was about learning about their family, that could be done anytime. Something is shady for them to only want her out there for Christmas", "Absolutely, there will be three-day weekends and such in the future. I cannot understand the push that, no it has to be this week or never! \n\nBizarre!", "right- they need to find the equivalent of Chinese school for their kids. That's not OP's job- OP is their uncle not their teacher.", "Actual culture?? Are you saying white.. sorry, yt people don't have actual culture? \n\nHe could have had his access to \"ytness\" and his sister, he chose one over the other so why do you have to make it a race thing....", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 way to tell everyone here you didn't bother to read the actual post.", "Sister, and I\u2019m guessing south Asian not Native American", "Sounds like a power and control issue. Just say sorry no let\u2019s schedule something that works for everyone. This doesn\u2019t.", "OP is an aunt", "In Indian culture it\u2019s common for some Indians ppl to choose \u201cytness\u201d over their own culture. It has a lot of do with the historical impacts of colonialism and rac*sm against Indians (and occurs in both Asia and the western world). A care & respect for Indian culture only came about recently, which is why the kids might care.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that this is part what the brother wanted to do (no understanding of Indian culture, married a white woman/cut out his Indian relative for his new white family, etc.). So it could be racially motivated.", "\"Ytness\" isn't a culture..", "NTA, he pushed you away until now. He can wait", "Hm there's missing information here.", "NTA He ditches you and then snaps his fingers and expects you to come like a dog at his command. Oh, and pay for the privilege, too. No.", "I'm sorry to tell you miss...he didn't really want you over.  He was most likely guilted by his wife and kids into inviting you and you asking for the ticket refund gave him justification in his mind to completely blow you off.  Enjoy the cruise...", "NTA. You can now be family? Unbelievable", "NTA. He could choose family over money by giving you money to cancel the trip. After how he's treated you, he should expect you to drop everything on a dime to give his kids lessons on cultural heritage.", "There\u2019s always next year.  Just say you have made your plans and you can meet some other time if it fits into your busy schedule. I am going on a Christmas Cruise as a solo traveler so I hear you. You can go next year, possibly, but this year you are Crusin\u2019.", "NTA. I am so sorry they\u2019ve put you into a position where you feel like you might be the asshole, while they are indeed the ones in the wrong. I pray you find people who value you instead of your brother and his wife.", "so you can make an effort several times and get shot down, but when they make an offer you are obligated to the point you have to cancel a trip that was paid for?  NTA but they are both TA", "NTA. He wrote you out of his life a long time ago. Now, he wants you to change a well-deserved vacation to educate his children about their culture which he was too self-absorbed to learn. He sounds like an entitled AH. Good people use things, not people.", "NTA", "NTA. He cuts you out of his life and now expects you to be at his beck and call and make you lose the money you paid on the cruise? If he really wants his kids to meet you, it could be any time, not just at Christmas.", "NTA. Remind him of his words. Tell him you already made and paid for your plans and you are going to enjoy them. Another time.", "NTA, he\u2019s being ridiculous. Enjoy your cruise!", "I'm sorry your brother is so incredibly selfish.  NTA.", "NTA tell your brother this is the family he made. Just go NC with them.", "Brother thinks he can just be rude, cancel you as family then tell you,  nah, now you can come. He isn\u2019t the director of your life. Where\u2019s your parents? Start making your own family. Your biological one sucks. Tell your nieces and nephews that your culture obviously doesn\u2019t care about blood family. That\u2019s why they never met you. Ask your dad. Then leave.", "Your brother is terrible. He wanted to distance himself from you because you are Indian. And now that his white and kids are asking you about he imperiously summons you and demands you lose your cruise money? \n\nSo sorry man.", "NTA. Now the that the children are questioning why they don't see their Aunt. The brother and spouse are panicking. They don't want the kids to know they are AHs.", "This was hard to read. Your brother is one of the shittiest people I have ever read about on here and that\u2019s saying something. I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re alone like this. I hope you find a good man and have the chance to create your own family some day so you at least have some.", "Whatever you are asking = NTA, however him not wanting to bond with you could have deeper background we would be unaware of. Was his childhood with you a good one? Did you bully him or hurt him or wasn't there for him in any way? Were you missing from his life before?\nAll these contribute to his current sentiment of you, and as the man of his family his responsibility to them is very high, its his own family which should be priority this I strongly agree.", "Yta for letting this women near your child let alone holding them. Otherwise nta", "NTA. Your brother sounds like a dick", "NTA You should go on your cruise and meet his family on your timeline. He should have been a better brother anyway.", "NTA he only wants you to come when his wife claps.  Fuck that enjoy your cruise", "NTA, they\u2019ve got some nerve. Your brother and SIL have shown you that they only value you for what you can do for them. They didn\u2019t want anything to do with you until you proved yourself to be of some use to them, and now they\u2019re demanding your attention. They don\u2019t want a relationship with you until it\u2019s convenient/beneficial for them, and a one-sided relationship like that isn\u2019t the kind of relationship you want.", "He has basically ghosted you for years and now you are TAH? No, enjoy your cruise. Tell your SIL you will be happy to meet up in the new year on a weekend.  Please start building your own friend network. NTA.", "Seems youre both toxic. Maybe best if you stop communicating.", "NTA your brother is THE worst kind of AH. I am SO very sorry you've been treated this way, you certainly don't deserve it and there is nothing more painful. Ignore it, and ignore him - if you were to allow yourself to be drawn in, it would give him an opportunity to hurt you again and again in the future. You need to take care of yourself and your life since you are on your own; your own well-being must be your priority!! Make it a goal to be financially secure, make good friends who are loyal and who love you, and find a good mate who will treat you the way you deserve.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he exclude his only living family member from Christmas?\n\nNeed to make your own family and forget about him. You've tried, he doesn't really want it. So let it go.", "NTA you can always say you are sorry but you have plans for Christmas, but so happy he is reaching out, you\u2019d love to start getting to know his wife and kids, etc.  Let\u2019s plan something for NYE?", "NTA.  Your brother is a user.  Go on the cruise and enjoy it..", "you didn't choose money over time with family, you chose money (and a cool trip) over spending time with a guilt ridden relative and his family who are, to all intents and purposes, strangers. You can spend time with them any time they choose, just not when you've booked a much needed vacation. He is definitely TA. So is his wretched wife.", "Go to your holiday\n\nThey just need a free babysitter \n\nNta", "NTA. Why are they insisting that you come only when it suits them and to ruin your trip is beyond me. Looks like they are jealous of your trip. The heritage can be handled any time. Very odd that they cannot invite you another time, maybe they wanted someone to help around this time ?", "Perhaps you can reach out to your cousins and find out how they are?", "NTA", "NTA - Your brother decided to cut you off from his family.\n\nHe\u2019s only reaching out because his kids have been asking. He wants to use you. He just needs you because of your knowledge of your culture. \n\nYou\u2019re not a toy that comes running when summoned. He was happy to throw you away when it was convenient for him.\n\nIt feels like he\u2019s ashamed of your culture and erased you until he now gets questions from his kids that he cannot answer.\n\nIf he really wanted you to be a part of his kid\u2019s life, he could invite you at another time and you could first meet them via video call,\u2026 \n\nYou\u2019ll have a lovely time in the cruise.

Sorry for the confusion.", "As someone not in touch with his heritage, you are probably right, there's activities and opportunities I didn't take and after feeling shitty and trying to understand just why I did what I did it came to me \"this is making me feel too close to the culture I keep rejecting \"\n\nSo what I mean to say is, it's perfectly plausible this is what's happening and OP's brother may not even realize it, which isn't an excuse, totally the opposite, in my opinion it only makes him worse.", "yeah this screams racism (internalised or otherwise) & now that the kids are realising they're not white, the parents want to use OP & pretend like they never had any issues about race.", "Yeah, there already booked the trip and then the child care fell through.", "Bingo!", "Bro needs a babysitter for something he and his wife want to do over Christmas is my guess.", "Both of my passed parents away in a car accident when I was 20.
