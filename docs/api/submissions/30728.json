You booked the trip after they made it clear to you, that you're not part of their life.\n\nI'm sorry to say that I don't think they're interested in rekindling a relationship with you that goes both ways. They need someone to answer questions for the kids - and maybe a free babysitter.\n\nIf they pay for the trip and you visit them,  they'll probably mention it many many times... So maybe just don't and surround yourself with people who value you. After all, \"the family we create is more important than the family we are born\", according to your brother, right?", "NTA.  The audacity of your brother!  So, you weren't family when it suited him, but now that he's getting questions from his kids, he's all about you being family?  That's ridiculous.  Go on the cruise, have a blast, and don't worry about your brother or his family.  He made his bed, and now he can lie in it.", "So he cuts you out of your life but now wants you to come for Christmas because he wants something from you. They both sound extremely entitled. The nerve, they never wanted you around but get upset because you don't drop what you're doing??!! You are so NTA. Go on your cruise and make memories. Family is not always blood, so surround yourself with people who love you for you and not what you can do for them.", "NTA. I suspect you wouldn't have booked the cruise if they hadn't been basically telling you that you aren't part of the family, plus they can always visit you outside of the holiday season if it is that important to them. Enjoy your cruise.", "NTA\n\nAs soon as your brother got what he needed out of you he'd dump you again. He is the one who treats family like sh!t, not you. \n\nChange your number. Your brother sucks. Go NC.\n\nSurround yourself with people who actually love and respect you. Your brother and his family do not love or respect you. You are just the exotic aunt.", "NTA, but after a point, I don't know why you were still trying to be apart of a group of people who don't want you there.", "NTA- why can\u2019t you visit another time? He\u2019s completely ignored you until now he can wait for a different timeframe.", "NTA... he decided to not include you in his and his family's life even though you tried numerous times... and now out of the blue, when his kids are interested in your culture it suddenly becomes important that you share with them....\n\nDon't give up your cruise and enjoy your trip... Tell them you are happy to spend time with them any other time if they are still interested...", "He only wants you when it suits him ! You\u2019d get the one visit to explain your heritage then he\u2019d blank you again . Don\u2019t be taken in .", "NTA\n\nDon't cancel the cruise. Have a really great time and don't worry about your brother. You shouldn't go running to him just because he decided to come calling.", "NTA\n\nLet's start with the offered explanation - you already booked the cruise and out of nowhere your brothers wife decides that they want you to come over for Christmas.  The Cruise is non refundable and if they wanted to spend time with you bad enough (out of nowhere), or really even felt like you were true family, they would make arrangements to meet with you before or after the cruise or pay the debt if they insist on a date during it.\n\nI really hate when people use \"family\" as an excuse to manipulate others that are related.  My mother and I were estranged for 25 years, due to her religion, until she was older and came to terms with just wanting to spend her time with family.\n\nFrom what you have outlined, your brother and his family went LC with you and have not wanted you over for any holidays until their \"children\" started questioning their heritage.  From what you wrote, it seems like your SIL is the one pushing to have you over to share your Heritage and Culture, NOT to actually spend quality 'family' time with them.  This isn't a family holiday get together, it is having you over to teach them what they cannot - nothing more.\n\nThis is me being the AH now - I would tell them no thanks, and that you are taking the cruise and they can hire a tutor for their children.  If they want to mend relationships then they can start by meeting with you alone to catch up and work out any issues that are on the table.", "You can't go to Christmas with them because you've already made plans. You declined gracefully. The end. No reason to tell your brother you can accommodate him if he covers your expenses. Just go on your trip and tell them you'd love to be included another time when you're given reasonable notice. Lots of people are making holiday plans for NEXT year right now.\n\nIf they want to spend time with you they will figure out how to not surprise you after ignoring your for years.\n\nNTA", "> I confronted him about it, and he gave me the whole \"the family we create is more important than the family we are born\" to lecture. I was just done so I hung up the phone.\n\nDid you remind him of this?\n\nI see he sold himself out for access to ytness, and now is trying to backpedal because his kids want actual culture.\n\nNTA for asking him to pay for your trip since he's also the one asking you to cancel it in order to come to his house, which isn't something he actually wants (based on his previous behavior).\n\nHonestly, he owes you a huge apology and *a lot* of sucking up/making ammends... but that'll only happen if you also believe you are owed those things. Good luck!", "NTA - Your brother repeatedly basically said that he didn't care about you being family. Has not invited you to any of his holiday events or any get togethers, but all of a sudden you are supposed to drop everything because all of a sudden \"we're family\"?! I'm sorry but fuck that mess. I mean I'm not saying you shouldn't see them or go NC (I'm sure ppl here will tell you that) but it doesn't have to be during the time of your trip. I would just say \"look for years I tried to be 'part of the family' as you want to say, but was told you had a family and didn't need me. So, I have made other plans for holidays this year. I can come next year or to something else that you have, but this year I will be on a cruise.\" And if he still stand by his your an AH or fine you're not part of the fam, then I mean not a big loss because he has been treating you like that for how ever many years anyway. He's the asshole for the way he's been treating you. You aren't the asshole here.", "NTA. He deprioritised you first and way harder. Why can't he just propose another time wtf", "NTA.  You'd already made plans and put down the money when he showed up with his offer, so he has no grounds to stand on.  It sounds like he just wanted to use you for the benefit of his kids anyway.", "NTA. Should have just said that you have plans out of the country already for Christmas, but getting together another time would be great.", "NTA. You deserve your vacation and brother obviously needs something now, even if it costs you your vacation and the cost of the trip. Why can't you visit two weeks later. Or maybe this week for Dewali,   or next November since they want to give them some Indian culture.", "NTA\n\nParticularly since their invitation seems very self serving.\n\nHowever from your comments it does seem like you really do want to have a closer familial relationship with them. In that light, no matter what their motives and how self-interested they are, this WAS a door opening. That\u2019s the only reason I think it may have been nice to handle the invitation a little differently. \n\nYou\u2019re still absolutely correct not to cancel your cruise, but saying \u201cI\u2019m not available on these dates, but I\u2019m really grateful for the invitation! What if I come over (insert dates that work for you here - maybe New Years or a weekend before the holidays?), would that work?\u201d may have kept the door open and been a way to access a relationship with them and their kids, which would probably lead to more invites. \n\nOf course, if you did do it this way and they insisted it was their time frame or nothing, or if you have reason to think they\u2019d suck you in with false intentions and then just snub you again, then you absolutely should stick to your firm no and spare yourself the hurt.", "NTA Sounds like he chose money over family when he wouldn't make you whole on your trip. Mind you, he never acted like you were family to begin with.", "Your brother acting like Devdas (weak and spineless) right before Diwali is a trip. NTA!", "WTF is wrong with your brother. He is extremely selfish to expect you to drop everything for him. But when you wanted to be part of the family, he ignored you. Just tell him the same thing he told you, \"the family we create is more important than the family we are born.\" \n\nNTA. Go on your cruise.  Make new friends. Who, knows, they will be better than your real family.", "NTA. Why don't they book tickets on your cruise and join you? Then he doesn't have to pay for your cruise AND his kids get a great experience with the Aunt.", "Whenever I read about the \"olive branch\" and young kids are involved, I think, \"free babysitting expected\".\n\nPlus, \"I practically banned you from my life but now that I deign to reach out,  just put your life on hold and come jump through these hoops.\"\nNTA. Go on your cruise and don't give them another thought", "So if this is face value than NTA and honesty girl why are you still talking to someone whose clearly so disinterested in having a relationship with you.

It really shouldn\u2019t be all or nothing for you as who\u2019s to say after you go they don\u2019t drop you again. \n\nI\u2019m all for reconnecting if he is the only family you have left, but who says it has to be exclusively on THEIR terms?", "Let's be clear: Dave cut off his brother because he wanted to cozy up to his new white family.  Sounds like he is disconnected or actively despises his heritage.  But now the kids are curious...and mommy and daddy now all of a sudden want OP back in.  Because otherwise the two of them look like whitewashing racists.\n\nIf both OP and Dave are American Indian, there's a term for Dave in that community: an \"apple\".", "I think the plan was for OP to stay with the kids for a few days \u201cteaching them their culture\u201d while bro and his wife go on a couples trip\u2026 If it was about learning about their family, that could be done anytime. Something is shady for them to only want her out there for Christmas", "Absolutely, there will be three-day weekends and such in the future. I cannot understand the push that, no it has to be this week or never! \n\nBizarre!", "right- they need to find the equivalent of Chinese school for their kids. That's not OP's job- OP is their uncle not their teacher.", "Actual culture?? Are you saying white.. sorry, yt people don't have actual culture? \n\nHe could have had his access to \"ytness\" and his sister, he chose one over the other so why do you have to make it a race thing....", "\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44 way to tell everyone here you didn't bother to read the actual post.", "Sister, and I\u2019m guessing south Asian not Native American", "Sounds like a power and control issue. Just say sorry no let\u2019s schedule something that works for everyone. This doesn\u2019t.", "OP is an aunt", "In Indian culture it\u2019s common for some Indians ppl to choose \u201cytness\u201d over their own culture. It has a lot of do with the historical impacts of colonialism and rac*sm against Indians (and occurs in both Asia and the western world). A care & respect for Indian culture only came about recently, which is why the kids might care.\n\nThere\u2019s a chance that this is part what the brother wanted to do (no understanding of Indian culture, married a white woman/cut out his Indian relative for his new white family, etc.). So it could be racially motivated.", "\"Ytness\" isn't a culture.."]}
