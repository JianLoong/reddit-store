I have over \u00a330k in savings for this sole purpose. We have a separate \u201creal\u201d savings account for emergencies. My wife knows I\u2019ve been saving up and supports me, and we share joint accounts and have had no financial issues. I\u2019ve been looking forward to next summer when I can finally make my purchase. \n\nThe trouble is my mother-in-law is getting quite sickly, so my wife has been going over to her mum\u2019s house fairly often this year to care for her. My MIL lives alone now as my father-in-law has passed on. My wife takes turns with her brother every week to care for her\u2014she has a colostomy bag and is needing more aid. We\u2019ve hired a carer to help with some of the tasks (changing the bag, bathing, etc.) but my wife says she and her brother are getting physically tired. My wife works full-time as do I, and so does her brother. \n\nMy wife has asked if we can put her up in a nursing home, one with a qualified nurse to take care of her. I asked her how much it would cost per month, and she said it was around \u00a3800! I asked if her brother can halve it, but she said since he has a family of 5 so he can only practically give \u00a3100. That would be \u00a3700 a month for us! \n\nI told her we can just hire our current carer for 2 more hours a day for 4 days as she lives just down the block from my MIL (and is much cheaper), my wife is adamant that we put her up in a nursing home because it has a round-the-clock qualified nurse and comfortable rooms/equipment! I said, we\u2019re going to feel squeezed on cash if we do that\u2014just hire the damn carer for more hours (final cost for us would be around \u00a3350 on our end with her brother\u2019s \u00a3100).\n\nMy wife had the bright idea that we can dip into my boat savings to support her mum in a nursing home and give us some financial cushion to not feel squeezed, I said not bloody likely! I\u2019ve been building that boat fund for several years and I\u2019m about to buy one this coming summer, we\u2019re not using my savings to put her up in a home with a professional nurse when there is a perfectly fine carer to help her on a day-to-day basis! Paying \u00a3700/mo would drain my fund which means no boat! I told my wife if she wants to put her up in a nursing home, her mum needs to sell her terrace house and use the proceeds to pay for her own nursing home costs. \n\nMy wife doesn\u2019t want to put her mum up to this because she wants to keep the house in the family *and* have her mum in the nursing home! I told her these were the two options on the table to meet her mum\u2019s needs,but taking out of my boat fund so that she can have her cake and eat it too wasn\u2019t an option. She called me selfish and accused me of being heartless for \u201cchoosing a stupid boat\u201d over her mum! She accused me of putting the boat before her ailing needs and comfort. It made me feel kind of bad and made me doubt.\n\nAm I being unreasonable here? AITA?\n\nEdit: Spaces for easier reading\n\nEdit 2: Thanks for the thoughts everyone! I'll read more later:\n\n-My wife helps her mum after she gets off work, bi-weekly (she switches off every week with her brother), so for 2 weeks out of the month she has no responsibilities for her mom. \n\n-During her week, a caretaker helps take care of her mum at key hours of the day for 4 days--she lives down the block. My wife's mum needs some help with the bag, and has some mobility issues, but isn't completely helpless. Her doctor is fine with either a nursing home or a more dedicated caretaker. \n\n-My wife will inherit the house one day.\n\nEdit 3: \n\n-My MIL wants to stay in her home. My wife and her brother would like her to have 24/7 care in a nursing home so they don\u2019t have to switch off weeks.\n\n-Yes, I will actually be using my boat quite often. Hence, me saving for a boat... it would be quite stupid to spend so much money for one or two rides a month.\n\n-My wife does not have a personal savings. We have a joint account and an emergency savings together. I\u2019m the only one saving, but for my boat.\n\n-The house will belong to my wife, not me. Her brother is older and already has a home with his family. He already got some other inheritance compensations from their father.\n\n-Thanks for the idea of renting! I\u2019ll bring it up and see what she says when she starts talking to me again.", "created_utc": 1667584421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym5kvh/aita_for_not_wanting_to_spend_my_boat_savings_on/", "score": 572, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Granted, a boat is a money sink and not the wisest investment, and perhaps keeping the house seems like a better investment.  However, the house belongs to mom and your wife does not know how the house will be dispositioned eventually. That info is not here.  Real estate is not always a better investment and can equally be a money sink. We have no idea what the house is worth, and if it is not enough to pay for mom's care, the remaining family members may have to assist.  Not sure if your wife has her own separate savings, as you do, but those would be the next in line as she is family.\n\nBear in mind that the best way to enjoy the pleasures of a boat is to have a good friend who owns a boat.
