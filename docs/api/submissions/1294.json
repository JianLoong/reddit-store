I have over \u00a330k in savings for this sole purpose. We have a separate \u201creal\u201d savings account for emergencies. My wife knows I\u2019ve been saving up and supports me, and we share joint accounts and have had no financial issues. I\u2019ve been looking forward to next summer when I can finally make my purchase. \n\nThe trouble is my mother-in-law is getting quite sickly, so my wife has been going over to her mum\u2019s house fairly often this year to care for her. My MIL lives alone now as my father-in-law has passed on. My wife takes turns with her brother every week to care for her\u2014she has a colostomy bag and is needing more aid. We\u2019ve hired a carer to help with some of the tasks (changing the bag, bathing, etc.) but my wife says she and her brother are getting physically tired. My wife works full-time as do I, and so does her brother. \n\nMy wife has asked if we can put her up in a nursing home, one with a qualified nurse to take care of her. I asked her how much it would cost per month, and she said it was around \u00a3800! I asked if her brother can halve it, but she said since he has a family of 5 so he can only practically give \u00a3100. That would be \u00a3700 a month for us! \n\nI told her we can just hire our current carer for 2 more hours a day for 4 days as she lives just down the block from my MIL (and is much cheaper), my wife is adamant that we put her up in a nursing home because it has a round-the-clock qualified nurse and comfortable rooms/equipment! I said, we\u2019re going to feel squeezed on cash if we do that\u2014just hire the damn carer for more hours (final cost for us would be around \u00a3350 on our end with her brother\u2019s \u00a3100).\n\nMy wife had the bright idea that we can dip into my boat savings to support her mum in a nursing home and give us some financial cushion to not feel squeezed, I said not bloody likely! I\u2019ve been building that boat fund for several years and I\u2019m about to buy one this coming summer, we\u2019re not using my savings to put her up in a home with a professional nurse when there is a perfectly fine carer to help her on a day-to-day basis! Paying \u00a3700/mo would drain my fund which means no boat! I told my wife if she wants to put her up in a nursing home, her mum needs to sell her terrace house and use the proceeds to pay for her own nursing home costs. \n\nMy wife doesn\u2019t want to put her mum up to this because she wants to keep the house in the family *and* have her mum in the nursing home! I told her these were the two options on the table to meet her mum\u2019s needs, but taking out of my boat fund so that she can have her cake and eat it too wasn\u2019t an option. She called me selfish and accused me of being heartless for \u201cchoosing a stupid boat\u201d over her mum! She accused me of putting the boat before her ailing needs and comfort.

She wants mom\u2019s money for herself rather than allowing mom to use her own money.", "NTA\n\nDoes MIL even want to go into a nursing home?\nTo be honest if she can get the care she needs in her own home that would be far more comfortable than any facility. \nI think you should consult MIL and her doctor first.\n\n2nd off, This boat you have worked hard for to get. Your wife will simply inherit her house so she really doesn't see the true value of the boat to you. It's not just about the boat, it's about years of work you put in to get it. \nSure a house is a better investment and can be rented for money...but you didn't work hard to save up for someone else's retirement.", "NTA. You\u2019ve offered a couple of compromises. It Seems like a carer would be a kinder option for your mom. Not many people are hoping to be put in the nursing home. Plus, you\u2019re trying to help your wife by having the carer more often.", "info:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs having a boat really more important than making sure your mil has a more comfortable life and that your wife isn't slowly fatiguing herself to the point that she had to ask for help only to get you getting mad at her?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike I know you've been saving but shit happens and life happens.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTake this from someone who randomly had 3 seizures on the same day at the begining of the year when i've never had them before.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShit changes when health statuses change and you adapt", "NTA based on th e info you have given here.  What your wife is saying is that she does not want to use her mother's  resources for her own benefit.  it sounds like mom owns the house.   If mom is not coming back to the house, sell it and use it for her care expenses.  Why hang on to an empty house?  Granted, a boat is a money sink and not the wisest investment, and perhaps keeping the house seems like a better investment.  However, the house belongs to mom and your wife does not know how the house will be dispositioned eventually. That info is not here.  Real estate is not always a better investment and can equally be a money sink. We have no idea what the house is worth, and if it is not enough to pay for mom's care, the remaining family members may have to assist.  Not sure if your wife has her own separate savings, as you do, but those would be the next in line as she is family.\n\nBear in mind that the best way to enjoy the pleasures of a boat is to have a good friend who owns a boat.  Many people will see it as an expendable play toy, and will advise you not to put toys over family.  Even though it may be a cherished dream, a boat cannot love you back.  Perhaps get some advice from a financial counselor to help you sort through the care finances and your own family savings.", "NTA.  Your suggestion to sell MIL's house is the perfect compromise.  Your wife is wrong to ask that you sacrifice your savings when she's not willing to sell the house.", "NTA\n\nWhile I am *entirely* sympathetic to wanting to keep the townhouse (I'm still sad about my grandmother's house being sold), it needs to be sold to pay for your MIL's care. Even if you liquidate your savings, that's only going to last a couple years. Then what? \n\nYou and your wife and her brother need to meet with your MIL's doctor and find out what level of care she needs, and then, if the decision is that she needs round-the-clock care (if she has a significant fall risk or mobility issues or memory problems, this answer is likely to be yes), then it makes zero practical sense to keep the house. Your MIL's assets need to pay for her care. \n\nKeep your savings, and enjoy your boat.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A house rents for over double what the nursing home costs in most areas. He could pay for mil with money earn by her own house and put more into savings for the boat if OP is willing to let a few months of boat funds be used for inital nursing home set up before he could get everything back.\n\nAnd people save for years for things they rarely use, example classic cars.", "- it\u2019s not their house, it\u2019s MIL\u2019s, so they might not be able to legally rent it out at all\n\n- it\u2019s MIL\u2019s property, even if the property was put up for rent, MIL would collect the income from it (until she passes)\n\n- there\u2019s no guarantee they get the house when she passes.  Brother could get it, or they might not be able to afford the taxes on it (if they\u2019re struggling to afford to even put MIL into nursing care, then that\u2019s a real possibility)\n\n- renting out a house isn\u2019t just a free mountain of passive income.  \u201cA house rents for double what the nursing home costs\u201d again you are making assumptions with no support.  You don\u2019t know what kind of house it is or what area it\u2019s in.  You don\u2019t know the taxes on it or the expected maintenance it will need.  Nearly half of rental income goes right back into expenses for the rental property (and that\u2019s for a typical property, that doesn\u2019t have any additional issues).  You don\u2019t even know if MIL owns the house outright or if she still has a mortgage on the house."]}
