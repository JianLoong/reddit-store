It would have been a gift, it's not like you're now taking away something she already had. Quite frankly she sounds too immature for a car. \n\nNTA obviously, and you have my sympathies for having to deal with this. Good luck and condolences to your son.", "NTA You certainly don't want to reward this unacceptable behaviour. Defend your son, he needs you right now - he's been betrayed by family", "NTA. \n\nOn top of being car-less, I would have further grounded her for calling her mom a bitch.", "NTA. Honestly you should get her in therapy because the lack of human decency she shows is alarming.", "wow your daughter sounds really self entitled thinking she can hurt her brother and still get a car after disrespecting you.... you  daughter is the AH", "NTA - That lack of remorse thing...  you'll never see your daughter the same.", "NTA. She doesn't respect her brother. That's the main take away here. \nA lot of people say that this sub is quick to jump to suggesting therapy.... But in this case I really suggest gifting your daughter a therapist for her birthday. She may not realize (too self absorbed) just how fractured she's made her relationships with her family. This is something your son is never going to forget. Even when the two break up, he still won't forget. It won't magically be \"fine\". Your son will most likely be paranoid that she'll try to steal every person he tries to date, and he might be right, she sounds mean spirited enough to do so. He will probably also not feel comfortable in his own home for some time/if ever again when she's still living there. You should give your son the option of talking to someone as well (but for her I wouldn't let it be an option but a requirement). \n\nShe's done a hefty bit of damage and she needs to learn consequences. I suspect when your son moves out or goes to college he will go no/low contact with her and not attend family events if she's there, and if she stays in the same mind set, she'll just double down and say he's being dramatic and it's not a big deal until the day she dies. Maybe you have a chance to change her mindset with a therapist, but even if you can't you shouldn't reward her when she's done something that's pretty unforgivable. \n\nAlso, if your son chooses to cut contact with her, you should support that. Yes it will suck for you to be in the middle, but he deserves whatever support he needs to move on from something this traumatic. \n(Ordinarily a breakup can be upsetting, but when a blood relative that lives in the same house cheats and steals your partner, that's extremely traumatic and such a huge violation of trust)\n\nBack to the main point: do not reward bad behavior. If she can't understand what she did was wrong and why, then she doesn't deserve any kind of reward until she's figured it out.", "NTA dont get her a car!!!", "OP, you've raised someone who behaves like a monster. You need to do more than take away her car. Look at her life. What can you change about it? She either has something seriously wrong with her, or she hasn't been given enough chances to learn empathy.\n\nIf you give her an allowance, stop. Maybe it's time for a job.\n\nIf she hasn't volunteered, tell her she needs to. Maybe seeing outside of herself will teach her something.\n\nIf she has access to social media, maybe it's time to cut her off. Maybe she needs to be going straight home after school.\n\nWhatever you do, do more than not give her a car. That's like saying, she beat up a kid at school, so you won't be giving her a gold crown. It's not even a punishment. It doesn't teach her anything.\n\nThink of what opportunities she can have to be a better person. Donating some of her stuff? Her time? Etc.\n\nAnd get your son into therapy. He was just terribly betrayed by his own sister. I would figure out what to do with your daughter and then focus on your son. NTA.", "NTA she was extremely cruel to her brother. The fact she has zero remorse is scary. You should NOT give her a car. As a fellow parent I can tell you that you are making the right choice.", "YWNBTA.\n\nParents are not legally required to buy their child a car. And your daughter doesn\u2019t seem to deserve one. I\u2019d be less concerned over the car and more concerned with where this cruelty and callousness came from.", "NTA. A car is a privilege, not a right. She lost that privilege when she decide to be mean and cheat with her brother\u2019s boyfriend. If this were to have gone unpunished, she would never learn and think this kind of thing is acceptable behavior.", "Irrespective of age, sleeping with your siblings partner is pretty much one of the biggest betrayals you can commit surely.\n\nYou daughter sounds awful.\n\nNTA.", "There is so much going on here. What an absolutely awful situation. \n\nNTA, with a caveat. \n\nIf the car was promised to her, a more in depth discussion is needed. I don\u2019t usually take away a promised item or experience/trip as a knee jerk reaction to bad behavior. She\u2019s definitely still a kid and ideally it would have been clearly expressed that a condition of receiving and keeping the car is contingent on her behavior and proven responsibility. \n\nBut oh my goodness what a mess she and Josh have created. I hope you find a way to get through to her, because she\u2019s making really bad choices right now. \n\nShe\u2019s being incredibly insensitive and hurtful to her brother in so many ways. Calling you names and disparaging his looks are just the symptoms of what sounds like a much bigger problem. I hope you can all get some help with navigating this. I for one would feel completely out of my depth with how to handle getting through to her in a way that she can move forward in life with a better moral compass.", "NTA, she shouldn't have done any of that.", "So Josh is bisexual, your son is gay, your daughter is straight? Damn we lost Jerry Springer too early.", "Hmmm, yes, your daughter did your son wrong. There should be consequences(yours was maybe a bit too harsh tho, maybe postpone the purchase until your son forgives her or something?) for her actions, especially for calling your son ugly. That being said, even in this situation IDK if it was right from you to ask her to break it off with him. You could have formed it more as advice. I hope your kids make up and move past this.", "Well what are you punishing her for? Stealing the boy? Cuz then I can see the asshole there as you don\u2019t really know who started what (tho based on post it can be inferred she did) or is it for saying her bro is to ugly for Josh cuz then NTA and she needs to learn some manners.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It takes two to tango and she knew who he was and what it would do to her brother but didn\u2019t care.  Being indifferent to that kind of immoral and just plain cruel act would be bad parenting.  Cannot condone that, cannot let her think it\u2019s okay.

Still, even if it's really painful for Jake, his love life shouldn't take priority over hers. She has the right to choose who she wants to date (even though it's kinda, sorry for the expression, but bitchy from her). She should definitely learn a lesson and you should definitely make it as easy as you can for Jake. But still, I don't think it's right for your to punish her for who she dates.

Not everybody has nice kids, this daughter seems pretty nasty, but it is still OP's kid. I'm not saying that her daughter should be off the hook, I'm saying the point should be for her to realize her mistake, realize how she hurt her brother and try to do some self-reflecting. If she is under 20 I doubt she would do that when her mother told her who to date(she will only further victimize herself like she is now). The guy will probably cheat on her too and she'll probably regret doing this.", "There wouldn't be, but she did. It is what it is now, the daughter is clearly rebellious and vindictive.
