She doesn't respect her brother. That's the main take away here. \nA lot of people say that this sub is quick to jump to suggesting therapy.... But in this case I really suggest gifting your daughter a therapist for her birthday. She may not realize (too self absorbed) just how fractured she's made her relationships with her family. This is something your son is never going to forget. Even when the two break up, he still won't forget. It won't magically be \"fine\". Your son will most likely be paranoid that she'll try to steal every person he tries to date, and he might be right, she sounds mean spirited enough to do so. He will probably also not feel comfortable in his own home for some time/if ever again when she's still living there. You should give your son the option of talking to someone as well (but for her I wouldn't let it be an option but a requirement). \n\nShe's done a hefty bit of damage and she needs to learn consequences. I suspect when your son moves out or goes to college he will go no/low contact with her and not attend family events if she's there, and if she stays in the same mind set, she'll just double down and say he's being dramatic and it's not a big deal until the day she dies. Maybe you have a chance to change her mindset with a therapist, but even if you can't you shouldn't reward her when she's done something that's pretty unforgivable. \n\nAlso, if your son chooses to cut contact with her, you should support that. Yes it will suck for you to be in the middle, but he deserves whatever support he needs to move on from something this traumatic. \n(Ordinarily a breakup can be upsetting, but when a blood relative that lives in the same house cheats and steals your partner, that's extremely traumatic and such a huge violation of trust)\n\nBack to the main point: do not reward bad behavior.

Maybe she needs to be going straight home after school.\n\nWhatever you do, do more than not give her a car. That's like saying, she beat up a kid at school, so you won't be giving her a gold crown. It's not even a punishment. It doesn't teach her anything.\n\nThink of what opportunities she can have to be a better person. Donating some of her stuff? Her time?
