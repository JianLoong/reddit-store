She doesn't respect her brother. That's the main take away here. \nA lot of people say that this sub is quick to jump to suggesting therapy.... But in this case I really suggest gifting your daughter a therapist for her birthday. She may not realize (too self absorbed) just how fractured she's made her relationships with her family. This is something your son is never going to forget. Even when the two break up, he still won't forget. It won't magically be \"fine\". Your son will most likely be paranoid that she'll try to steal every person he tries to date, and he might be right, she sounds mean spirited enough to do so. He will probably also not feel comfortable in his own home for some time/if ever again when she's still living there. You should give your son the option of talking to someone as well (but for her I wouldn't let it be an option but a requirement). \n\nShe's done a hefty bit of damage and she needs to learn consequences. I suspect when your son moves out or goes to college he will go no/low contact with her and not attend family events if she's there, and if she stays in the same mind set, she'll just double down and say he's being dramatic and it's not a big deal until the day she dies. Maybe you have a chance to change her mindset with a therapist, but even if you can't you shouldn't reward her when she's done something that's pretty unforgivable. \n\nAlso, if your son chooses to cut contact with her, you should support that. Yes it will suck for you to be in the middle, but he deserves whatever support he needs to move on from something this traumatic. \n(Ordinarily a breakup can be upsetting, but when a blood relative that lives in the same house cheats and steals your partner, that's extremely traumatic and such a huge violation of trust)\n\nBack to the main point: do not reward bad behavior.

Maybe she needs to be going straight home after school.\n\nWhatever you do, do more than not give her a car. That's like saying, she beat up a kid at school, so you won't be giving her a gold crown. It's not even a punishment. It doesn't teach her anything.\n\nThink of what opportunities she can have to be a better person. Donating some of her stuff? Her time?

Put divider walls up. You aren't going to be able work on this empathy thing if both of you think you're acting as the avenging hammer intending to inflict as much harm to her as Jake feels. She has to be able to tell you're doing it with *her* own best intentions in mind, or she will block you out and run right to Josh to get knocked up. Punish the crappy behavior towards her brother separately.\n\nYou also need to leave a path open for her to earn the car back. Outline some steps to take and behaviors she needs to practice for her to get the car restored to her. If you don't and just leave her giftless... and then present Jake with a car on his next birthday, you'll be permanently down a daughter and she'll turn into a Greek fury who claws your family happiness to shreds.", "NTA. i\u2019m sorry but kara sounds so\u2026awful. how can anyone say that about a family member", "NTA. But you do realize forbidding her from seeing Josh makes him more exciting", "NTA for the car thing, but it's really fucking weird you're cool with your 14 year old dating a 17 year old.

Get Jake a car instead.", "NTA, someone that can be that immoral shouldn't be behind the wheel of a car, who knows what kind of bad decisions she could make that could get people hurt.  Maybe she'll grow up and change, or maybe she won't and will go out on her own and do not great things, but for now she doesn't get away with it.", "You don't buy her shit! \nYou're dealing with this much too lightly. Not only is this incredibly damaging to your son, but your daughter is showing very serious issues. She shows no remorse for taking the boyfriend, she's insulting your son, she has ZERO empathy, and still expects to be treated well. \n\nMy advice: talk to the BF and tell him what he did is horrible and he's not allowed in your house ever again. Inform his parents of this, too. \nTell your daughter the same and that you are incredibly disappointed in her behavior. I would suggest therapy, actually. These are signs of pyschopathy (even if she is \"just\" the spoiled golden child, but you haven't given indications of that in your post). Your son also needs attention and care. I would suggest therapy for him, too because this can't be a one-off with his sister. She sounds horrific.", "NTA, wow! Your daughter sounds.... incredibly cold and cruel and like she's behaving that way because she thinks it's OK.\n\nGood on you for putting a punishment in place! Maybe the loss of a car will give her a tiny insight into what her brother is experiencing right now!", "If you get her a car, she\u2019ll just think all is forgiven and that she\u2019ll get her way no matter what. She doesn\u2019t deserve to be forgiven. If she\u2019s willing to do that to her own brother FOR MONTHS, she could do worst to you and others. Even if she shows any remorse, I wouldn\u2019t buy into it.", "NTA. My brother and I have literally had to be held back from each other, but we respect the Golden Rules. Don't seriously put each other down, and don't mess with the other's relationships. Her lack of empathy and remorse COULD be a mental disorder, though, and would be better evaluated by a psychiatrist. Maybe use the car money for that?", "NTA. She helped her brother's partner of 2 years to cheat on him, with her, insulted her brother's appearance to justify stealing his boyfriend, then insulted YOU on top of it. \n\nGround her, too. No electronics except for school work, no going out, no fun, no parties, no seeing the gross ex boyfriend, because that boy shouldn't be in either child's life. \n\nAlternately, let her learn the hard way that if he'll cheat on them to be with her, he'll cheat on her with the next person who catches his eye... but since she is your kid I'm assuming you'd like to stop her from experiencing that.", "NTA. Considering her lack of remorse or care for others, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even safe for her to have a car to others on the road.

NTA", "I mean if my daughter called me a bitch I wouldn't get her a car", "Parent OP you showed her that bad behaviour do have consequences so NTA. Stand your ground and show her that you will not tolerate her bad attitude", "NTA. She needs to learn that actions have consequences.", "Woah woah woah, she called you the B word, yelled at you and all she got is a \"you are not getting a car and what you did was wrong\".

Poor Jake.", "Nta.", "NTA  Your daughter's entitlement is through the roof! The most I'd do at this point is take money put it in a bank account that she can't touch then tell her that when she earns an equal amount you'll release the money to her.

She needs to get out in the world and discover what real people are like.", "NTA\n\nBut I don\u2019t think punishing her is going to do much. Punishment is to correct a behavior. What punishment makes her cognizant and considerate of others? \n\nIf taking the car gift back then I would give it context that you decided to keep the money and she is too untrustworthy for a car anyway. \n\nI think therapy is the best advice.", "Here's the thing it's your kids and you can choose what you want to do with them. You also get to choose what is and is not acceptable behavior. While I actually agree with your decision for what happened, it wouldn't matter if I didn't.", "NTA", "NTA. If I spoke that way to someone in my family at that age, I wouldn\u2019t need a car because I would be dead. \n\nShe has a lot of growing up to do and not getting a car is the exact reality check she needs and deserves.", "NTA\n\nWhat I'd like to know is where did she get her morals from that allowed her to behave so awfully.  This isn't necessarily a reflection on your parenting as older teenagers can be very led by the people they hang out with.  Have you seen signs of this sort of entitlement (me, me, me and I don't care who I hurt).  Especially when you think about comments she may have said in the past and things she has done.\n\nThe car and the behaviour are not linked.  Telling her you are taking away her car was probably best not said at this time. However I don't think she deserves a car full stop.\n\nTime to change the rules around the car... kids need to get a part time job and pay for one themselves.  How much they save will tell them how much they can spend.  You can help them.  That can go for both your son and daughter.  They may appreciate the cars more if they were the ones that had to work for them.\n\nBut your bigger issue is what are you going to do about your daughter.  She has hurt your son unimaginably.  The worst part is that because of her age, you are very responsible for her so it's not like you can kick her out.... well you could but you'd be doing something just as nasty and also likely illegal.\n\nThere will not be any happy families for a long time if ever because of this.  Your son has been very hurt by this.  He may be young but this is hurtful and humiliating.  Support him how he needs to be supported.  Consider counselling because I suspect that there have been issues in their sibling relationship for a very long time.\n\nYou'll need to work out what he would like.  I wouldn't be having Josh over at your house again.  That is not fair.  Maybe your daughter might decide to stay with Josh at his parents house for a while.  I would consider separating the kids if there is a safe place for them ie your daughter may need to stay at her grandparents for a few days, or your son might.  But this is difficult because it can seem like you are prioritising one of the kids and not the other.  I think your son may need to drive this aspect of it.\n\nHe doesn't have to spend any time with his sister.  So if you normally all sit down at the dinner table... that might have to be take a break  You could force them to sit together but that will fuel the animosity.\n\nI'm not sure there's much that your daughter can do to fix this but she doesn't sound very contrite and she'll likely deliberately make things worse by how you describe her.\n\nNot a good place to be.  And no clear picture with exactly what you need to do.  You can tell your daughter that you love her but her actions are abysmal.", "NTA. Your daughter and the bf should both be ashamed of themselves. \n\nImo she deserves nothing for the way she treated you and your son. Maybe let her get a summer job and earn the money ( or at least part of it) for the car, taxes,  insurance, and repairs. Then, maybe next time, she'll be more respectful to those around her.", "So many siblings stole my boyfriend stories on here lately, eh?\n\nAnyway NTA.", "Ops NTA for what happened with her daughter.\n\nShe's thr AH for letting a 14 year old sate a 17 year old.", "OP please listen to this. My sister did all sorts of terrible things to me and I was forced to be around her. When I was 17 she attacked me while I sleeping - she was 21. My parents \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do\u201d and she was mad I was going to move into her old room. Was not the first time she had been physically abusive but it was the most traumatic. \n\nProtect your son or 20 years later your daughter will have manipulated it to being his fault. Sharing to others for years that \u201cdoesn\u2019t like you cuz you stole her bedroom\u201d \n\nThere are many more things that happened over the years. Please protect your son from your daughter.

This is the most stupid thing I've ever heard, why do you think bad behaviour should be rewarded.

WTF is wrong with this girl???", "But but Josh is not FAMILY. Family take care of each other, right?", "I had to buy half of my car (which was all I could save up with a summer job, that was the only job I could get without a car lol) then when that car got totaled by a drunk driver, my mom took the half she paid (with interest, since they paid me way more than we paid for the car, as it was a classic and I restored bits of it, I was very lucky). Without a car I wouldn\u2019t have been able to get a job, or even get to school, as my sibling had graduated and they\u2019d been my ride. US cities and towns are not set up correctly for the car-less, it\u2019s ridiculous", "She needs to learn about consequnces sooner rather than later.

Though if dad or grandparents are an option her staying with them for a week or two so that her brother can more comfortably process and decompress a bit wouldn't be a horrible idea.\n\nI highly doubt the sibling relationship will ever be the same, or even existent, and that's an okay decision for her son to make, but the son holds all the cards here. It's his decision to forgive or not, his decision how much contact to have, and whether she is eventually sorry or not he still has the say so on how his relationship with her pans out. \n\nAt the same time, mom is still allowed to love her daughter. What happened is very complex due to the circumstances and she's caught in the middle. All 3 of them have a very long road ahead regardless of what paths they take. \n\nAlso, I do agree with the suggestion that josh is permanently banned from op's house.", "how is the car a reward?", "I didn't say she was entitled to a car. OP intentionally framed it as taking away something from her and it doesn't sound like there was a discussion about how her actions lead OP to think a car was no longer appropriate, and what should have happened in my opinion is actually addressing the problem rather than using a random punishment and escalating the situation further.", "To be fair, OP is a controlling B; Josh told Jake he wanted to be with Kara. Jake cried to mommy about the break up and she banned Kara from seeing Josh.\n\nShe'd have done better to tell Jake that at his age a lot of people aren't settled in their sexuality, oftentimes when people are young their relationships aren't going to be long-term and that there are other fish in the sea.\n\nTaking Jake's side when Josh broke up with him was absolutely the wrong thing to do. Had she not dine that, Kara wouldn't have acted out.\n\nBye bye daughter, I love my son more.", "So don\u2019t reward bad behavior. Not only did she cheat with her brothers bf, she was mean to her brother and massively disrespectful to you. \n\nShe needs to learn that there are consequences for her actions.
