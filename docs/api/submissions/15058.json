We had new neighbors move in ~ 4 months ago or so and they have three little dogs. They have a small yard, so they always walk their dogs on our lawn.

I don\u2019t mean they just stroll by while they\u2019re on a walk - I mean they walk deep into our lawn by our cars and hang out for 5 - 10 min sometimes. So I asked the other day if they could please stop doing it, and they became super combative with me about it. They started yelling at me and telling me to get documentation from the town that states they can\u2019t walk their dog on our lawn. AITA for asking them to stop walking their dogs on our lawn all the time even though they pick up their feces?
