The field trip was to a place about an hour away for context. Yesterday, my mom asked if I wanted to come with her and I said maybe, since it was sort of early to leave and I have work today as well. Well, not 30 minutes ago she comes to my camper (it\u2019s in the backyard) and asks me to take him on the field trip. Literally any other time I would\u2019ve said yes, but today just didn\u2019t work out for me, I didn\u2019t even know what time I would be back. I have work at 4, and she said she would\u2019ve been back before then, but sometimes she does just say these things. She said that since I wouldn\u2019t take him that I needed to get out, and that she wouldn\u2019t talk to me for awhile. AITA? Maybe I should just have said yes, my problem is when I can\u2019t drop everything and do what she wants all the time she makes me feel horrible. Thanks for reading. (Also, she said she couldn\u2019t take him bc she cleaned out the pantry yesterday and said she was hurting from that, that was her reason.)", "created_utc": 1667564064, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ylxfaf/aita_for_not_taking_my_little_brother_on_his/", "score": 8, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have 4 kids, and would never expect one of them to step up for the other. You have a job, and life. Since shes lied in the past, you\u2019re right about being cautious of her not being around in time for you to get to work on time. \n\nIf you pay rent, even more so to say no, since you\u2019re a babysitter that pays her to watch her kid. If you dont, how does she expect you to be able to move out if babysitting affects your ability to work? The only arrangement I\u2019ve seen this work is where the parent gave the older sibling days in advanced notice, and didnt ask when it collided with her work schedule or social plans.

Personally I am sick and tired of these so called parents that threaten their kids with homelessness to get their way. The fact that your Mother used this threat just because you couldn\u2019t do the field trip is frankly mean, nasty, petty and cruel.
