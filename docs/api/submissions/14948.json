Places that need volunteers don't generally want or need badly behaved children who don't want to be there that are there to learn a lesson. If your plan is to teach him the value of money, a paying job is going to do that better than volenteering imo.\n\nEDIT: seeing as I'm the top comment, I'd better add a judgement I guess? Between OP and her son, NTA, which is what OP is asking so I guess that's my judgement?

No handouts from anyone.", "NTA. It's pretty alarming that Mason treats people who he views as beneath him so horribly like that. Hopefully you can talk to his therapist about this incident so they can address it with him. No way should he be rewarded with a $10,000 trip after behaving so cruelly.", "I usually don't support denying school trips as a form of punishment, but this time is an easy NTA. Thank you for not enabling another spoiled rich kid.", "Your son spat on somebody?! You are NTA but your son had better be careful.", "NTA.

Your son can become a biologist without a $10k vacation.", "NTA.\n\nYou're trying to teach him a lesson he seemingly desperately needs.", "NTA. But as a reminder, spitting on someone is assault. Your son is not just an asshole; he's a criminal. And if he thinks that spitting on someone is okay as a child, what will he be like as an adult?\n\nThe trip to Australia should definitely be off the table, but grounding your son should just be the start of punishment.\n\nI hope his volunteering includes working with the homeless and mentally ill.", "im gonna say NTA. it IS a once in a lifetime trip opportunity, but that kind of behavior is incredibly disrespectful and privileged and i doubt any other type of punishment or correction would even partially get through to him. besides, he can always go another time if you or him are able to find some kind of program that does something similar to what he wanted to go for. if you had the money once to send him, you could save it for another time or wait for it to come back again. money, trips, opportunities, they come and go, but who you are as a person stays with you for life. and he seems to need a real awakening to see that his actions have consequences and need to be dealt with.", "NTA. Your son needs to learn the value of hard work and the importance of being kind to others. It's not okay for him to disrespect someone who is less fortunate than him. It's good that you're trying to teach him a lesson by making him volunteer, but maybe you could also sit down and have a conversation with him about why his attitude is not okay. It's also not fair for his father to try to undermine your parenting decisions. You're doing what's best for your son in the long run.", "The best you can do here is make sure he learns his manners ever so quickly - and not taking the trip will help even if he resents you.

Not only could it damage the relationship you have with your son further, but it sounds like the trip will be beneficial for his future. Which is what you want for him in the future I'm sure. Maybe find another way, maybe chores/charity work etc to earn his trip!", "I'm confused.  Your son called a homeless man names and derided him for not having a job, and then you punished him for not knowing the value of \"hard work\"? Your son's offense was cruelty not lack of appreciating hard work. \n\nHow is that remotely equivalent in your mind.  Your son's behavior was straight up appalling, but you are absolutely confused and erratic in both the messaging ( I don't even get what you are saying and how that applies to the offense) and I also don't get how the punishment fits the crime. \n\nHe should be punished. 100 percent.  But... what lesson and how does this TEACH him anything?  Force him to volunteer at homeless shelters, or soup kitches, or tell him if he thinks jobs are so easy to come by he can now get one himself and earn the money for his trip/things. \n\nYou aren't the worst mother in the world but your messaging and consequences are so erratic and hard to follow as to be pointless.", "NTA - You are trying to discipline your son", "NTA. What kind of school is this? 10k dollars for a teenage school trip? Get him out of that school and into one that doesn't force parents to cough up a second mortgage to make their kid 'happy'.

I was able to go on a $15,000/per student trip in highschool. My theater program was invited to perform in a festival in Europe - this was an incredible opportunity for us, growing up in a pretty rural and impoverished community. We worked our asses off raising those funds and a lot of kids left the program because they didn't want to work for it. We even made it onto our local radio and news stations to raise more money, and in the end our own school board leant us the last $5,000 we needed to make the deadline and get to the festival, which we continued to work to pay back once we came home. The year of fundraising and the two week trip itself, which included the privilege of performing in an internationally recognized theater festival, was awesome for all of us who went through with it and we experienced a lot of growth through this process.\n\nPoor kids deserve opportunities, too, and it's excellent for schools to allow programs like this to reach out to students even when the cost is great.

Should he get rewarded for that by going on a trip worth $10.000?\n\n That's not alienating the son, that's parenting.

All it will do is drive him back to his father's house.\n\nVolunteering is a good idea. Working out some sort of sweat equity schedule to earn the trip (so he appreciates its value) is also a good idea. But you won't punish him into compassion.\n\nAnd there was a woman a while ago, who was given an opportunity to set the consequences for her teenage SIL stealing from her.

Something you could do to help teach him the value of money is to put money to chores. This is something my parents did to me, saying that as a member of the household I am entitled to some of the money, but I have to earn it. Each chore has a set value and if he does it, with proof, he gets the money. In a counter to this, he doesn't get anything paid for by you. So if he wants to go to the movies with friends, it comes from what he earns. If it is a family outing, you can still pay for the base costs, but extras are on him.\n\nDepending on when the trip is and the payment is due, you could allow him to go by using this money to pay for it, or at least a set part of it. You could set the amount he can earn to cover only a little more than how much he has to contribute. So if he has to pay $2000 of it, he can make $2500 if he does all the set chores between now and then. Then he can have some spending money and missed chores while still getting to go. Also set rules about behavior so if he keeps acting bad, he can't go.\n\nExplain all of it to him, help him set a budget, plan ahead, etc. Have his money go to \"The Bank of Mom\"  and he can withdraw when he needs it, no questions asked, no lecture about saving for the trip, it is 100% his money. Have two \"accounts\", a savings account and a trip account. Money can only come in from chores, no deposits (so his dad can't just give him money for the trip), and the trip account can't be withdrawn from. If he doesn't earn enough by the deadline, the trip account rolls over to the savings account so he doesn't just lose his money. With the two accounts, he can choose to automatically send some of the earnings towards the trip, locking in the money before he has a chance to spend it. You could even do a matching program, where for every dollar he puts into the trip account you will also put in a dollar.\n\nMy parents didn't do this for me for a specific trip, just for my general allowance. So if we were at an event, they would pay for my ticket and meal, but I had to buy my own snacks and souvenirs. They still had some snacks at home, but it was limited and I had to buy my own if I didn't like what they bought. It really helped me learn how to save and understand the value of money before I was old enough to work.\n\nYou could do something like $2 to wash the dishes after dinner, $10 to mow the lawn once a week, $5 to clean the bathroom once a week, etc. Adjust the prices for how long things will take so it is a fair rate. If it is tied to the trip, just make sure he has a chance of making it. The matching program for the trip account could be used to help offset the timeline he has to save while also keeping the rates low enough to continue after the trip long term. But you keep the matched amount if he doesn't make it", "Hey, I just wanted to post and say good instinct!\n\nI have known some people who thought similarly about unhoused people when they were teens.

That way you know your money is going to the right places and not to addiction or people preying on the na\u00efve for profit.

But it could be a good wake up call seeing a different way of life here", "I don't know if you live on property, but there is grass to mow, weeding to be done, as well as other physical work for you or neighbors.\n\nI understand that many kids don't want to do this, but I had a kid knock on my door looking for work.  He got the job and I pay him well.  He and his family immigrated from Eastern Europe.", "Forcing someone to serve in a volunteer position is inherently NOT VOLUNTEERING.

Sounds like in your school, the students had to earn the funds, but at OP's son's school, the most effort the students have to put out is reminding their parents to sign the check (or, this day in age, click the link on their reminder email).", "Unfortunately, it sounds like dad can easily come up with 10K and is annoyed at mom for nixing the trip already. So dad, who he probably/possibly learned this behavior from, well write the check, the kid will learn nothing and extra resentful towards mom. The kid's already in therapy, but without dad backing mom up, I think that therapist is going to have a hard time getting the kid to see mom's perspective, especially since seeing other people's points of view is clearly not a strong point for him.", "He doesn\u2019t deserve a future.", "BIG mistake! HUGE!", "Oh boy...it really sounds like you have your work cut out for you then. I like the volunteering idea, but those who work in that field make an excellent point that trying to manage a resentful entitled teen, is unlikely to make their lives easier. Given that he spat on someone when out with you, your presence can only go so far in stopping him from abusing others, which will be especially disheartening to them in an environment that's supposed to be specifically designed to help (as opposed to just being on the street). If you can find an organization that the situation and is willing to help great, but if not you might consider reaching out to see if there are any projects that may present him with less opportunity to make someone's day even harder. At the same time, maybe you can try a bit of a research project. If spitting is considered assault where you live, have him look up what the minimum sentences are and how repeat offenders are charged. Then maybe have him research how that affects someone's employment prospects when the offenses are disclosed, particularly when they don't have his social and financial background. Have him talk to lower income lawyers/business people, and have him tell them that's it's just a research project to see if it gets him honest answers.", "Dude I went to private school never in my life behaved like that . That\u2019s just your bias", "While I'm glad you're at least going to be present, if your son actually takes this current attitude into the volunteering, you being there isn't going to prevent him from shittalking vulnerable people entirely. Yeah, maybe it'll give you the opportunity to IDK pile on a bunch of reactionary punishments until he gets the memo, but to do that he'll first end up saying a bunch of shitty things to people. \n\nIf you do the volenteering thing, you really shouldn't be choosing an activity that puts him face-to-face with people, and I do think that in that case the lesson you're intending may be too far removed from the punishment for him to learn anything?", "Yeah, I agree with the top comment. It's REALLY unfair to use vulnerable populations as punishment for your child. Nope, that's not right, it's utterly humiliating. People aren't desperate, poor, disabled and ill for fun.\n\nHave him get a job and work to educate him yourself. If you feel strongly about it, donate to those organizations and talk about root causes of poverty, disability and illness, but don't use actual real people as \"teachable moments.\"", "[removed]", "[removed]", "She already answered this. And she's not American, in some countries this is not a thing at all.", "You are suggesting the kid is so bad they won\u2019t be able to offer their labour for free , and your suggestion is they try to charge for their labour instead", "Don\u2019t forget: he just kicked his own son out of his house and sent him to live with his mother. \n\nSounds like the real AH here.", "There\u2019s clearly a lot of detail being left out.  I bet this would be a hell of a story in the hands of a better, more honest writer.", "That and \u201cwoke\u201d. Thank you.", "What the kid did was pretty bad, very rude. I wonder what happened to him to get to this point and what could be done to help him have a more positive attitude.\n\nWhy do you care more about virtue signaling than about understanding why the kid did it?", "You probably didn't try to spit on a homeless person though so he really should have to pay 100% if he wants to go, no matter how much time he has to earn the money.", "Sounds like he *was* living with his dad, but apparently his dad's schedule no longer allows for that, so he sent him to his mom? But even if he can go back to live with his dad, it's pretty clear where he lives is not really what OP is worried about so much as what kind of person he's growing up to be.", "Alternative: kid has to get a job, and his first X months of paychecks have to go to organizations helping homeless folks. No organization actually wants people like this to \u201cvolunteer\u201d, and it\u2019s not fair to those receiving services to deal with yet another threat to their safety and dignity.", "Maybe $2,500 for a round trip ticket.  Accommodations? Could have been a hotel, say $200 a night, so $2,800.  Um\u2026 food? Costumes?\n\nGeez I dunno.", "I could see it easy. Depending on where they're flying from, the tickets alone could be 2k. OP said the trip is \"around Australia\", so they may be going to several places while there and it's about as big as the US, so travel across the country could be very expensive as well. Plus room and board, meals, and supplies for doing the studying, possibly/probably insurance as well. All of that for what's probably a week minimum, possible several weeks...i could see that being 10K.", "Field trip aside, pulling the kid out of another familiar environment after he's been forced out of his original \"home\" sounds like an awful idea on a mental health standpoint.  The kid absolutely needs his shitty behavior corrected, but OP is right to not want to put her kid in a new school right now.", "He's 15 and made a mistake. Part of parenting is making children understand consequences of actions not writing them off as soon as they make one.", "Not every country has the same absurdity as the US. Acceptance to university in my country is based purely on your scores. Nothing else.", "And what punishment is that ? \u201cOh you just spit on someone I\u2019ll still pay 10 k for a trip but know that it\u2019s verrrry bad \u201c . Yeah he will learn consequences I\u2019m sure", "Forcing someone to serve in a volunteer position is inherently NOT VOLUNTEERING. Never use non-profits to teach someone a lesson. It\u2019s dehumanizing to the people who need those services and exposes them to an awful person.", "Then he will resent her. You can\u2019t be afraid to discipline your own child because you are too afraid of resentment. You try to teach them and if at the end they refuse it\u2019s their choice .", "Volunteering will subject vulnerable people to him, his behaviour and beliefs. And contrary to what privileged people think the marginalized aren't teaching tools to teach the rest of you how to behave.", "Aren't newspapers delivered at like 5am now?", "There's no minimum age where I live.  It's causing a rukus at the moment because a local company is employing kids as young as 11 to work due to staff shortages.

While the idea that teaching him money doesn't grow on trees by giving him an impossible goal might sound fun to internet strangers, giving him an impossible goal might be needlessly cruel or backfire and get the kid earning a lot of money fast the only ways that you can really do that, which is generally theft, dealing drugs, or other problematic things.\n\nMaybe some sort of \"I'll pay for half your trip/three quarters of your trip if you can ante up the other half/the rest\" (based on what's a feasible amount of hours for him to work before the trip) \"and in the future trips will be entirely up to you to fund,\" warning? I'm also kind of considering the idea here that OP can put a monetary value on hours volunteered if the kid can't get a job, and after X hours volunteered then she'll pay for the trip? Maybe dad can pay half if he thinks it's that important and mom will pay for the other half if the kid does a hundred hours of volunteering before the trip or something? Presuming that goal is feasible. Could also give OP the best way to keep her kid in line while volunteering, if she warns him that he'll \"lost his job\" if he behaves badly towards vulnerable people while volunteering and lose the opportunity to earn back his trip?
