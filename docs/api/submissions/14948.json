I was appalled completly. i told him to apologize but he tried to spit on the man who i then gave $50 to as i felt horrible mason would do this.\n\nI told Mason he was not allowed to go on the trip as punishment as the trip is $10,000 and he doesn't know the value of money or hard work and has a classist attidue.  instead he will be volunteering while the rest of his friends go on the trip as he has a terrible attidue. He called his father and his father is now very upset and trying to covnicne me to go and Mason is calling me the worst mother in the world.\n\nEDIT: based on the comments, i think he will not be forced to volunteer as i do no want him to insult anyone else and instead have to pick up trash. he will not have allowance for a while and I will pay him to pick up the trash. if he makes 2k by may in addition to apologizing and genuinely showing a change in attitude he may go.", "created_utc": 1681656695, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12obkiv/aita_for_not_allowing_my_teenage_son_to_go_on_an/", "score": 3474, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Places that need volunteers don't generally want or need badly behaved children who don't want to be there that are there to learn a lesson. If your plan is to teach him the value of money, a paying job is going to do that better than volenteering imo.\n\nEDIT: seeing as I'm the top comment, I'd better add a judgement I guess? Between OP and her son, NTA, which is what OP is asking so I guess that's my judgement?

No handouts from anyone.", "NTA. It's pretty alarming that Mason treats people who he views as beneath him so horribly like that. Hopefully you can talk to his therapist about this incident so they can address it with him. No way should he be rewarded with a $10,000 trip after behaving so cruelly.", "I usually don't support denying school trips as a form of punishment, but this time is an easy NTA. Thank you for not enabling another spoiled rich kid.", "Your son spat on somebody?! You are NTA but your son had better be careful.", "NTA. That your son thinks it's ok to spit on another human being is revolting. Your son can become a biologist without a $10k vacation.", "NTA.\n\nYou're trying to teach him a lesson he seemingly desperately needs.", "NTA. But as a reminder, spitting on someone is assault. Your son is not just an asshole; he's a criminal. And if he thinks that spitting on someone is okay as a child, what will he be like as an adult?\n\nThe trip to Australia should definitely be off the table, but grounding your son should just be the start of punishment.\n\nI hope his volunteering includes working with the homeless and mentally ill.", "im gonna say NTA. it IS a once in a lifetime trip opportunity, but that kind of behavior is incredibly disrespectful and privileged and i doubt any other type of punishment or correction would even partially get through to him. besides, he can always go another time if you or him are able to find some kind of program that does something similar to what he wanted to go for. if you had the money once to send him, you could save it for another time or wait for it to come back again. money, trips, opportunities, they come and go, but who you are as a person stays with you for life. and he seems to need a real awakening to see that his actions have consequences and need to be dealt with.", "NTA. Your son needs to learn the value of hard work and the importance of being kind to others. It's not okay for him to disrespect someone who is less fortunate than him. It's good that you're trying to teach him a lesson by making him volunteer, but maybe you could also sit down and have a conversation with him about why his attitude is not okay. It's also not fair for his father to try to undermine your parenting decisions. You're doing what's best for your son in the long run.", "The best you can do here is make sure he learns his manners ever so quickly - and not taking the trip will help even if he resents you. People who didn't learn not to spit on others in their childhood usually learn it the very, very hard way. NTA, obviously.", "NTA, and your husband doesn't really have a leg to stand on as his behaviour was obviously learnt not from your side! However it maybe counterproductive to deny him this trip. Not only could it damage the relationship you have with your son further, but it sounds like the trip will be beneficial for his future. Which is what you want for him in the future I'm sure. Maybe find another way, maybe chores/charity work etc to earn his trip!", "I'm confused.  Your son called a homeless man names and derided him for not having a job, and then you punished him for not knowing the value of \"hard work\"? Your son's offense was cruelty not lack of appreciating hard work. \n\nHow is that remotely equivalent in your mind.  Your son's behavior was straight up appalling, but you are absolutely confused and erratic in both the messaging ( I don't even get what you are saying and how that applies to the offense) and I also don't get how the punishment fits the crime. \n\nHe should be punished. 100 percent.  But... what lesson and how does this TEACH him anything?  Force him to volunteer at homeless shelters, or soup kitches, or tell him if he thinks jobs are so easy to come by he can now get one himself and earn the money for his trip/things. \n\nYou aren't the worst mother in the world but your messaging and consequences are so erratic and hard to follow as to be pointless.", "NTA - You are trying to discipline your son", "NTA. What kind of school is this? 10k dollars for a teenage school trip? Get him out of that school and into one that doesn't force parents to cough up a second mortgage to make their kid 'happy'.

This is questionable, I don't know any school trip that costs ten grand", "I don't approve of going back on your word with children.

Your son likely learned the classiest attitude from his dad and there will be a fair amount of work to undo that.

Punishment should be proportionate to what the child did, and I would say this is, as a start. Backing it up with bringing up with his therapist (and suggesting family counseling for OP and her son), and volunteer work should help. Take him to community outreach educational programs about addiction, mental illness, and homelessness as well. You can't *force* him to listen, but it might give him a chance to see he's wrong (and educate him on what addiction looks like, which is super important for teenagers as some are starting to experiment with drugs and alcohol and it might make them see that they/their friends binge drinking at parties isn't just \"fun\", it's alcoholism)", "Homeless/disadvantaged people are not there to be a punishment for someone.

I was able to go on a $15,000/per student trip in highschool. My theater program was invited to perform in a festival in Europe - this was an incredible opportunity for us, growing up in a pretty rural and impoverished community. We worked our asses off raising those funds and a lot of kids left the program because they didn't want to work for it. We even made it onto our local radio and news stations to raise more money, and in the end our own school board leant us the last $5,000 we needed to make the deadline and get to the festival, which we continued to work to pay back once we came home. The year of fundraising and the two week trip itself, which included the privilege of performing in an internationally recognized theater festival, was awesome for all of us who went through with it and we experienced a lot of growth through this process.\n\nPoor kids deserve opportunities, too, and it's excellent for schools to allow programs like this to reach out to students even when the cost is great.

You expect a 15 year old to be able to change their upbringing in an instant?\n\nProbably from the father who had custody of him up until recently.

Should he get rewarded for that by going on a trip worth $10.000?\n\n That's not alienating the son, that's parenting.

Something you could do to help teach him the value of money is to put money to chores. This is something my parents did to me, saying that as a member of the household I am entitled to some of the money, but I have to earn it. Each chore has a set value and if he does it, with proof, he gets the money. In a counter to this, he doesn't get anything paid for by you. So if he wants to go to the movies with friends, it comes from what he earns. If it is a family outing, you can still pay for the base costs, but extras are on him.\n\nDepending on when the trip is and the payment is due, you could allow him to go by using this money to pay for it, or at least a set part of it. You could set the amount he can earn to cover only a little more than how much he has to contribute. So if he has to pay $2000 of it, he can make $2500 if he does all the set chores between now and then. Then he can have some spending money and missed chores while still getting to go. Also set rules about behavior so if he keeps acting bad, he can't go.\n\nExplain all of it to him, help him set a budget, plan ahead, etc. Have his money go to \"The Bank of Mom\"  and he can withdraw when he needs it, no questions asked, no lecture about saving for the trip, it is 100% his money. Have two \"accounts\", a savings account and a trip account. Money can only come in from chores, no deposits (so his dad can't just give him money for the trip), and the trip account can't be withdrawn from. If he doesn't earn enough by the deadline, the trip account rolls over to the savings account so he doesn't just lose his money. With the two accounts, he can choose to automatically send some of the earnings towards the trip, locking in the money before he has a chance to spend it. You could even do a matching program, where for every dollar he puts into the trip account you will also put in a dollar.\n\nMy parents didn't do this for me for a specific trip, just for my general allowance. So if we were at an event, they would pay for my ticket and meal, but I had to buy my own snacks and souvenirs. They still had some snacks at home, but it was limited and I had to buy my own if I didn't like what they bought. It really helped me learn how to save and understand the value of money before I was old enough to work.\n\nYou could do something like $2 to wash the dishes after dinner, $10 to mow the lawn once a week, $5 to clean the bathroom once a week, etc. Adjust the prices for how long things will take so it is a fair rate. If it is tied to the trip, just make sure he has a chance of making it. The matching program for the trip account could be used to help offset the timeline he has to save while also keeping the rates low enough to continue after the trip long term. But you keep the matched amount if he doesn't make it", "Hey, I just wanted to post and say good instinct!\n\nI have known some people who thought similarly about unhoused people when they were teens.

They\u2019ll go to the Barrier Reef. They\u2019ll go inland a little\u2026 might head down to NSW / VIC and do some sheep/cattle and plant stuff. But it\u2019s mostly school trips to places that hold school trips (for Aussie kids) all the time - nothing wildly amazing except that it\u2019s in a different part of the world and the critters are unusual. Nothing you can\u2019t read in a grade 5 book on Aussie animals will appear.   \nAnd Aussies do NOT like snobs and AHs. We have our share, but we don\u2019t need more here.   \n\n\nDad doesn\u2019t get much more say than that because frankly Dad has created this child so far, and then thrown his hands in the air when it got hard. Dad needs to let the OP sort it out, or take the kid back.", "I was heading towards YTA but then you got to the part about the homeless man and nope NTA, he is too spoiled and definitely needs to learn from this, make him do chores around the house or dog sit or something and have him earn his money if he wants to go", "It seems that Mason has an elitist attitude and I wonder if he acquired that from his dad because it doesn\u2019t sound like OP is like that. Mason needs to learn that you\u2019re not rewarded for bad behavior and every person has value. He doesn\u2019t deserve to go on that trip. He should earn the money and pay for himself and he really should have been made to apologize to the man he viciously insulted.

I developed empathy for those who have less than me because I learned no matter how hard I work, I will never have much. I learned that the only reason why I have some luxuries in life isn't because I earned them, it's because of my folks.
