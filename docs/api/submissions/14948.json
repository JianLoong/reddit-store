No handouts from anyone.", "NTA. It's pretty alarming that Mason treats people who he views as beneath him so horribly like that. Hopefully you can talk to his therapist about this incident so they can address it with him. No way should he be rewarded with a $10,000 trip after behaving so cruelly.", "I usually don't support denying school trips as a form of punishment, but this time is an easy NTA. Thank you for not enabling another spoiled rich kid.", "Your son spat on somebody?! You are NTA but your son had better be careful.", "NTA. That your son thinks it's ok to spit on another human being is revolting. Your son can become a biologist without a $10k vacation.", "NTA.\n\nYou're trying to teach him a lesson he seemingly desperately needs.", "NTA. But as a reminder, spitting on someone is assault. Your son is not just an asshole; he's a criminal. And if he thinks that spitting on someone is okay as a child, what will he be like as an adult?\n\nThe trip to Australia should definitely be off the table, but grounding your son should just be the start of punishment.\n\nI hope his volunteering includes working with the homeless and mentally ill.", "im gonna say NTA. it IS a once in a lifetime trip opportunity, but that kind of behavior is incredibly disrespectful and privileged and i doubt any other type of punishment or correction would even partially get through to him. besides, he can always go another time if you or him are able to find some kind of program that does something similar to what he wanted to go for. if you had the money once to send him, you could save it for another time or wait for it to come back again. money, trips, opportunities, they come and go, but who you are as a person stays with you for life. and he seems to need a real awakening to see that his actions have consequences and need to be dealt with.", "NTA. Your son needs to learn the value of hard work and the importance of being kind to others. It's not okay for him to disrespect someone who is less fortunate than him. It's good that you're trying to teach him a lesson by making him volunteer, but maybe you could also sit down and have a conversation with him about why his attitude is not okay. It's also not fair for his father to try to undermine your parenting decisions. You're doing what's best for your son in the long run.", "The best you can do here is make sure he learns his manners ever so quickly - and not taking the trip will help even if he resents you. People who didn't learn not to spit on others in their childhood usually learn it the very, very hard way. NTA, obviously.", "NTA, and your husband doesn't really have a leg to stand on as his behaviour was obviously learnt not from your side! However it maybe counterproductive to deny him this trip. Not only could it damage the relationship you have with your son further, but it sounds like the trip will be beneficial for his future. Which is what you want for him in the future I'm sure. Maybe find another way, maybe chores/charity work etc to earn his trip!", "I'm confused.  Your son called a homeless man names and derided him for not having a job, and then you punished him for not knowing the value of \"hard work\"? Your son's offense was cruelty not lack of appreciating hard work. \n\nHow is that remotely equivalent in your mind.  Your son's behavior was straight up appalling, but you are absolutely confused and erratic in both the messaging ( I don't even get what you are saying and how that applies to the offense) and I also don't get how the punishment fits the crime. \n\nHe should be punished. 100 percent.  But... what lesson and how does this TEACH him anything?  Force him to volunteer at homeless shelters, or soup kitches, or tell him if he thinks jobs are so easy to come by he can now get one himself and earn the money for his trip/things. \n\nYou aren't the worst mother in the world but your messaging and consequences are so erratic and hard to follow as to be pointless.", "NTA - You are trying to discipline your son", "NTA. What kind of school is this? 10k dollars for a teenage school trip? Get him out of that school and into one that doesn't force parents to cough up a second mortgage to make their kid 'happy'. If he's in a school where this insane trip isn't happening, he won't feel left out. \n\nIf Dad's given up on him I don't know why he's bellyaching to you about anything.

This is questionable, I don't know any school trip that costs ten grand", "I don't approve of going back on your word with children. And he IS a child, he's only 15 and his primary role model up to this point as been a total jerk. OTOH, you can't send him off on the trip, knowing he's capable of this behavior.

Damn right you should cancel the trip, your son is lucky he isn't in legal trouble for his disgusting actions.\n\nNTA - if anything you have been to soft still.", "ESH. Your son likely learned the classiest attitude from his dad and there will be a fair amount of work to undo that.

Punishment should be proportionate to what the child did, and I would say this is, as a start. Backing it up with bringing up with his therapist (and suggesting family counseling for OP and her son), and volunteer work should help. Take him to community outreach educational programs about addiction, mental illness, and homelessness as well. You can't *force* him to listen, but it might give him a chance to see he's wrong (and educate him on what addiction looks like, which is super important for teenagers as some are starting to experiment with drugs and alcohol and it might make them see that they/their friends binge drinking at parties isn't just \"fun\", it's alcoholism)", "Homeless/disadvantaged people are not there to be a punishment for someone.

I was able to go on a $15,000 trip in highschool. My theater program was invited to perform in a festival in Europe - this was an incredible opportunity for us, growing up in a pretty rural and impoverished community. We worked our asses off raising those funds and a lot of kids left the program because they didn't want to work for it. We even made it onto our local radio and news stations to raise more money, and in the end our own school board leant us the last $5,000 we needed to make the deadline and get to the festival, which we continued to work to pay back once we came home. The year of fundraising and the two week trip itself, which included the privilege of performing in an internationally recognized theater festival, was awesome for all of us who went through with it and we experienced a lot of growth through this process.\n\nPoor kids deserve opportunities, too, and it's excellent for schools to allow programs like this to reach out to students even when the cost is great. Yeah, a lot of kids won't get to go, but some *will* and they deserve that chance, even when they have to work really hard for it.

You expect a 15 year old to be able to change their upbringing in an instant?\n\nProbably from the father who had custody of him up until recently. Also the reasons why the 15 yo decided to stay mainly with his dad point out that the child was allowed to act how they wanted, with no consequences to said actions. He spit on a human being. What? Should he get rewarded for that by going on a trip worth $10.000?\n\n That's not alienating the son, that's parenting. Certain actions have certain consequences and a 15 yo should at least learn that.

If you're buying extra food and snacks specifically for him, then stop that and tell him if he wants extra food outside the meals you prepare, he has to pay for it himself", "Having him volunteer for a single week/trip is useless. Having him volunteer for the next six months serves a purpose. A single one and done thing is idiotic.  It gives him no time to CHANGE his opinions since he will be simmering the entire time.    By having him volunteer I meant,... for real.

That's beyond crazy", "Probably. None of my children would spit on anyone.", "I definitely agree that it's 100% unacceptable and requires punishment, but as someone whose kid just recently went through the college acceptance process and knows how competitive it is, I don't think taking away academic opportunities is the way to achieve it. He shouldn't have any free time outside of academics though and should be required to do volunteer work that helps and supports the homeless community.", "My guess is it isn\u2019t a public school, or it\u2019s one of those special optional trips that most kids aren\u2019t going on. \n\nMy school had a trip to Ireland/England offered, but there were grade and behavior requirements and it was pretty expensive.

The mother is delaying punishment til months away because she doesn't have any interest in actually teaching her kid a lesson and just took away the first thing that popped into her head.  It's pointless.  It's literally the equivalent of coming home, finding your dog shit on the rug and then screaming at it, hours after the fact of the shitting.  There's no causal effect between your 'punishment' and the action.  It's pointless token punishment that requires the minimum effort and serves no purpose.", "he must do sports at his school and to get into the university he wants, sports are one of his only interests aswell, i cant just take that away. I cannot just change his whole life even more than it has already been changed. He is going in summer vacation to volunteer for at least 1 month straight I think that is acceptable regardless.", "IF He learns not to spit on people ( and I doubt that until he does it again and someone takes him down with a left hook) he learns it because someone took privileges from him.

And I am sure the trip would look JUST as good to colleges as sports. \n\nSee what I mean? Your rationales are highly erratic.", "LOL.. yeah the privileges 4 months from now.  What do you want to bet he doesn't volunteer at all, because he goes and stays with his dad instead, or just doesn't do it. He's not really facing any consequences.  Not getting to do a thing isn't really a punishment that fits the crime and delaying it for months is pointless.  There's a lot of homeless people he can spit on between now and summer.", "I agree i dont Believe she planned on letting him go anyway", "He knows he can't go *now*, though. There's only a limited set of arrows she can use.\n\nAlso, what is your proposal, he's her kid she can't write him off as damaged goods. Ground him for months? He'll run to his dad.\nI'm not saying OP's right, but that's one hell of a hole his father has dug for her and she shows she wants to start building a ladder."]}
