They do an annual white elephant gift exchange where everyone buys a gift of 25$ or less and puts them in a pile, all wrapped. People go around selecting gifts at random. \nThis was my first time meeting most of her extended family so I wanted to make an impression. I assumed it being a white elephant exchange gifts were meant to be comical and not serious gifts. So I bought a \u201cSquatty Potty\u201d. \nDuring the gift exchange my wifes aunt selects my gift (She def has Karen vibes). She is less then thrilled with her selection and gets visibly uncomfortable with the selection. I get a few laughs (about half the crowd, mostly the outlaws) from the crowd but there is definitely tension in the room. For reference most of the other gifts were lottery tickets, gift cards or things you get in the check out isle of bed bath and beyond. \nThe following year I get invited back and am explicitly told no gag gifts. Aunt Karen has created the new rule. Which I have (I think) abided by the following year. \nFast forward now years later we have missed a few Christmas\u2019s due to life, kids and COVID. This year we get sent a note by aunt Karen that \u201cOnly Tasteful\u201d gifts can be included in the exchange. When asking around this aunt is still upset with the squatty potty 8 years later. My wife and MIL is asking me what I am bringing because they do not want to upset the aunt. My BIL and SIL are egging me on to get another gag gift. \n\nAITA for bringing the Squatty Potty as a white elephant gift?\n\nP.S she upped the gift amount to $30 this year! So any ideas are welcome.\n\nEdit: couple of comments. \n\nMy wife didn\u2019t given me any instructions other then it was a white elephant. She regrets this now\u2026\n\nThere is the concept of gift swaps and exchanges but no one stole the squatty potty. Only 1 or 2 people went after her and they opted for picking a random gift. \n\nThis was the first time I was meeting that part of her family and I honestly thought this was a great ice breaker. I had not meet this aunt at that point in time and was not trying to single anyone out. \n\nI also forgot to mention I got called out for some of the hints I was dropping: \u201cthe gift I brought is pretty shitty\u201d \n\u201cIt will probably be the number 2 gift of the exchange \u201c \nShe didn\u2019t appreciate these comments either.", "created_utc": 1670897223, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zkj69d/aita_for_bringing_a_squatty_potty_as_a_white/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There were no restrictions other than price when you gave it, and so you did nothing wrong. Also a squatty potty isn't that bad - It's not like it was a vibrator or something. For your own sake, I probably wouldn't get anything controversial this year. But should you really want to, I would do a gag gift with food or something with a flavour and say it is full of taste if questioned.", "NTA - squatty potties are awesome! Whatever you do, DON\u2019T get Poo Pourri this year", "NTA. If the only guidelines you were given was $25 or less, then no one should complain that you followed them. Traditionally, white elephant gifts are funny. They shouldn't call it white elephant gifts if they don't want gag gifts. Call it simply a gift exchange or whatever.\n I'd definitely do a gag gift, as long as it's called white elephant. Something like a shower curtain with cats and lasers, or something equally ridiculous.", "Get a statue of a white elephant. Obviously. But NTA. You sound delightful.", "I fucking hate white elephant exchanges and love my squatty potty so NTA", "NTA! That\u2019s a great gift! I\u2019d be gunning to end up with that one over a dumb lottery ticket or gift card. Sure it\u2019s kinda silly, but it\u2019s functional!", "NTA - Squatty Potties are wonderful!

I wouldn't be without one.", "NTA because squatty potties are amazing and two it's white elephant if you take it seriously you're not doing it right.", "NTA \n\nGift ideas that may change the judgment by next year: Shake Weight, poop knife, potty putty (Golf putting game to play while on the toilet), poo-purri, framed print of the toilet paper patent (it goes over not under you heathen!)", "NTA. I don't think its particularly original but not that offensive. I think its come up on a ton of white elephant gift lists since they came out because the price point and humor involved. But I would take the clue/read the room and not do anything bathroom or questionable.\n\nI have a friend who puts actual white elephants into White Elephant gift exchanges, tea pot one year, stuffed toys, earrings, etc. If they're Yankee Swaps, she brings something yankee themed, Yankee Candles, NY Yankees, etc.", "NTA. The family kind of sounds prudish, which you should've been warned about beforehand. Having a grudge held for that long is ridiculous.", "NTA. Isn't that the entire point of a white elephant gift exchange?", "NTA. I mean no, don't listen to BIL/SIL if you actually want to keep the peace, but you're not the asshole for having done it.\n\nThat aunt is insane if she thinks White Elephant can be a \"tasteful\" game - the whole point is that it's either funny or vicious. If she wants to do a Secret Santa, then she should do that instead.", "White elephants are supposed to involve gag gifts. That's the whole point. A squatty potty isn't even that offensive. It's not like you brought an adult toy to a family event. \n\nI've been doing a white elephant with friends for a decade, and at this point the entire goal is to NOT get stuck with a very creepy Victorian era doll that we all swear is probably cursed. Sure, some people bring food baskets or booze, but most of us try to outdo each other with the most ridiculous thing we can find.", "Info: are they aware of what \"white elephant\" normally entails? They're often gifts that are gags or things nobody really wants", "NAH\n\nNot for bringing the gift. Just surpirsed if it\u2019s not a gag gift type of exchange, why your know wife didn\u2019t set expectations for you.

It was a \"white elephant\" gift exchange which would normally mean gag gifts. It's weird that she's still holding a grudge over an honest mistake. But I wouldn't bring a gag gift this time. If everyone else is actually bringing useful or thoughtful gifts that would be a dick move.", "so nta because a squatty potty is an amazing gift and you shoulda tried to sell them on how nice they actually are. Also, do you folks not do trades? I know I'd take a squatty potty over scratch tickets.\n\nJust indicate its from you somewhere if you go the gag route, it sounds like other people in the family appreciated it.", "NAH, but your girlfriend was an asshole back then by not explaining to you how her family's gift exchange worked. Honest mistake on your part then, but now you know so quit planning some childish repeat.", "NTA for the first one,  YWBTA if you do a repeat. Save your humor for a group that will appreciate it.", "If this was me, I would wrap up a large pack of toilet roll / bog roll. It can then be interpreted as a gag gift to those expecting a gag gift and can be interpreted as 'tasteful' too. Will also bring a few chuckles, I am sure.", "I laughed from beginning to end. 10 out of 10", "NTA - Thighmaster", "NTA- Gag gifts are totally ok with a white elephant exchange.\nThis year I'm getting a candle that burns for four hours as apple pie, then just poop smell. Awesome.", "NTA.\n\nThese people are overreacting. My wife gave me one of these for xmas a few years ago, and there was one in a recent white elephant. There's nothing wrong with a squatty potty. Furthermore, the risk and gamesmanship is the entire point of a white elephant exchange. \n\nIt's been 8 years. I think you can clap back at them if they keep digging you for this.", "Eh. I\u2019m leaning towards NAH here. White elephant gift exchanges vary depending on the group. For some groups, a wacky sex toy is an appropriate item to contribute, and for others, it would be considered incredibly distasteful. It\u2019s a bit odd that she\u2019s still remembering this 8 years after the fact, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong, and she\u2019s not wrong for specifying the nature of the exchange now. It sounds rather boring, but that\u2019s how she wants to do it. I will add, however, that most white elephant exchanges I\u2019ve taken part in involve a \u2018steal\u2019 mechanic, where you can either keep the gift you receive or swap it with someone else\u2019s when it\u2019s your turn; so I\u2019m surprised that her aunt got stuck with the squatty potty.", "**NTA**\n\n...and honestly, I don't even understand how a Squatty Potty was considered an offensive or gag gift. Like yes, it has a ridiculously silly name, but it's an incredibly practical household gift. 80% of the adults I know have one by choice (granted, I know a lot of chronically ill and disabled adults with gastrointestinal issues, LOL . . . but the point still stands: USEFUL!).", "NTA\n\nWhite elephant are gag gifts\nYankee swap is regular gifts \n\n\nI\u2019d get an etiquette book. With the section on accepting gifts bookmarked.", "I'm not sure how to judge these because I love what you did and that aunt sounds insufferable. But not sure if it's worth causing a fight. I mean if you and all the outlaws all get in on it together.... in solidarity this might be okay. :3\n\nBut I'm not sure I can actively say that's a good idea, just a hilarious one. I don't want you in trouble with the spouse over this. As to the original event NTA it's not even that bad and no one told you the \"rules\" so.", "NTA\nThat's the whole point of white elephant gift exchanges - you're supposed to get stuff like that.
