I assumed it being a white elephant exchange gifts were meant to be comical and not serious gifts. So I bought a \u201cSquatty Potty\u201d. \nDuring the gift exchange my wifes aunt selects my gift (She def has Karen vibes). She is less then thrilled with her selection and gets visibly uncomfortable with the selection. I get a few laughs (about half the crowd, mostly the outlaws) from the crowd but there is definitely tension in the room. For reference most of the other gifts were lottery tickets, gift cards or things you get in the check out isle of bed bath and beyond. \nThe following year I get invited back and am explicitly told no gag gifts. Aunt Karen has created the new rule. Which I have (I think) abided by the following year. \nFast forward now years later we have missed a few Christmas\u2019s due to life, kids and COVID. This year we get sent a note by aunt Karen that \u201cOnly Tasteful\u201d gifts can be included in the exchange. When asking around this aunt is still upset with the squatty potty 8 years later. My wife and MIL is asking me what I am bringing because they do not want to upset the aunt. My BIL and SIL are egging me on to get another gag gift. \n\nAITA for bringing the Squatty Potty as a white elephant gift?\n\nP.S she upped the gift amount to $30 this year!

Only 1 or 2 people went after her and they opted for picking a random gift. \n\nThis was the first time I was meeting that part of her family and I honestly thought this was a great ice breaker.

I\u2019m leaning towards NAH here. White elephant gift exchanges vary depending on the group.

That had his leg up (male dog peeing pose). White elephant exchanges are meant to be fun AND funny, it's not a super serious event. That dog was the gift I stole when I was given the chance, I love it. (I'm saying this as someone who doesn't really enjoy \"potty humor\", too!

If you want to give nice gifts, call it a gift exchange, not a WHITE ELEPHANT exchange.

I buy the nice kind, LED \ud83d\udca1. It may be boring, but everybody needs them, and at the right party people fight over it and it gets traded a lot. To be clear I don't think it's that awesome.

By the sounds of it it's just a regular gift exchange.", "Yeah, the whole point is that it's a game to see who can bring the worst gift, and who gets stuck with that gift. \n\nWE frankly isn't fun if it involves actually good gifts because then the competitiveness of the game takes on a tone of actual animosity and selfishness.
