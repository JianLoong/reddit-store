Lmao", "Yeah, even though she kinda pushed OP into it.\n\nIt's also kinda hilarious that all this is over a wedding ring, I know so many people who don't wear them, women included.\n\nI feel like we need a sub of this sub, kind of an \"Am I the annoying person?\" sub b/c so many posts on here aren't a big enough deal for judging-assholery-energy.", "Nope. A sex worker was propositioning to him and harassing him AT WORK.\n\nWhat he said was basically factual. You may have a problem with the tone, but you can't deny she is (or at least was acting as) a prostitute and deserved to be called out for propositioning.\n\nNow, of you have a problem with prostitutes, that's on you.", "He was being propositioned and sexually harassed at work lol", "It was pretty necessary. She asked a coworker to make pornographic content with her, didn't take no for an answer, and called him a liar and insisted he wanted to appear single. If she's going to be sexual and pushy, she deserves to be insulted. I bet if it was a man doing it to a woman you'd be saying the exact opposite of what you are now", "She is rude and deserve everything he told her..\n\nShe don't have to say anything about his life and deserved when he said about her life..\n\nShe insulted him, she deserves be insulted too.", "And she should have stopped when he said \"I'm married\"\nSwap the genders and I doubt you'd still be saying he the ah", "I mean, she went the sexual harassment route, and he went the hostile work environment route. Really, neither of them should have employment at that firm in short order.", "[deleted]", "Had the exact same thought. It was like N.......T........A....... HOLD THE PHONE, yes, YTA.", "harassed*****", "Jesus does. People getting propositioned to shoot a porno by their coworker might not", "Jesus wanted those sex workers to stop, might not be the greatest pro-sex work argument to use", "There's a whole church about it - xxxchurch. Jesus loves porn stars.", "Same! \ud83e\udd23 If I was there I would have said 'get wrecked' after that line haha! It sounds like he was dishing the same energy she was giving. \n\nBut I agree he should let his supervisor know before she does and this whole thing becomes more unnecessary drama.", "NTA. Fr, but you know the type of response this will get on reddit lmao", "Let's, be honest, it isn't. Everyone in the military and manual workers all sell their bodies, all hookers then?", "But she kinda is one?", "But the coworker asking him to make porn with him is perfectly ok....NTA", "Asking someone if they want to record porn with them is a bit different from expressing interest imo.", "How could he not be? If a male co worker told you they had an onlyfans at work, then asked you to shoot content while at work, I'd wager you'd feel pretty uncomfortable. Then, when you say no, they pressure you for an explanation multiple times. I'd imagine you'd feel pretty angry/upset. Then, in an attempt to shut down the conversation that you've tried to shut down politely at least twice, you make a mean comment. You're telling me you'd expect to be labeled an asshole and not him?", "What's your definition of someone who engages in any sort of sexual activity in exchange of payment? I'm legit curious.", "> Not the asshole for not wearing a ring. But you are the AH for calling her a hooker. Slut shaming is not cool.\n\nIf she feels shame that's on her, not him. Reddit really needs to stop calling any criticism or even factual descriptions \"shaming\".", "You don't think it is wrong, or at least inappropriate at best that she propositioned him for sex that would be filmed and posted on the internet while at work?", "There's nothing wrong with being a hooker", "She sexually harassed him in the work place!  Imagine if a man went up to a woman in the workplace and said \"hey do you want to make some porn later?\"  Get the fuck out of here.", "She quite openly proposed that he have sex with her for money from OF. That's prostitution. Nothing wrong with that in general, but since they are coworkers at their work place and she kept pushing after he declined, it's also sexual harrassment. NTA", "She asked her coworker if he wanted to tape some scenes with her for her OF account. Don\u2019t you think that should be reported? I do and I was in HR for 20+ yrs.
