Just ignore her.\n\nAlso if she earns money with only fans she's a sex worker (maybe next time use the more political correct term if you don't want to get into trouble, lol...), if she doesn't like being one or called one than maybe she shouldn't work as one?", "NTA my parents have been married over 30 years and my dad has never worn a ring, he doesn't like jewellery, as far as I'm aware no one has a problem with this.", "NTA I know a lot of trades people who never wear wedding rings. It's pretty inadvisable. I've seen photos of mechanics who shorted batteries out with their ring. It's also a workplace not a sex club or something. You shouldn't need to advertise your marital status.", "NTA brother is a mechanic and is happily married but refuses to wear rings because high-powered machines will skin you. Also, you were indifferent to her side hustle until she tried to include you in it, and you gave her a hard no. She took offense and insulted you and your family, and you rightfully so went down with her", "NTA anyone who knows people in the trades knows that jewelry\u2026including rings can be dangerous.  It is safety.  Coworker is completely wrong for propositioning him and then trying to turn herself into a victim when she got shot down", "YTA. I smell Fanfiction. \ud83d\ude44", "> I bet it made you feel really big though to belittle someone\u2026\n\nI don't blame him, if she is going to harass him, then she should be ready for a backhanded comment back to her.", "This was the fakest one yet tbh", "Same q.", "But he said it in a shaming and belittling way.\n\nIII", "Yeah idk why people are lying to themselves. He did basically called her a hooker no matter how people cut it up. Still NTA tho", "She deserves to be shamed - but not for being a sex worker.\n\nBut for talking about her OF at work with colleagues she barely knew, then asking one of them to film porn with her and refusing to take no for an answer.\n\nThat was a level of desperation and harassment that absolutely should be shamed.\n\nShe then threatened to get him fired when he said no. She sexually harassed him with no provocation and then threatened him. It's not nice to insult people but it's also not unreasonable when you ate being harassed or threatened.", "She sexually harassed him at work and asked him to join her to make porn. Even after being told that he was married and uninterested? How else was he supposed to react", "I understand what you are saying. My point is that he can be right, and she can be the wrong, the asshole. But he can still do or say something wrong.\nI understand him saying stuff to get out of the situation, but after that it doesn't make it right when he thinks about it with himself.\n\nIII", "Woman was called misandrist \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Prostitution is legal in lots of places, so I don't see how that's relevant.", "Fuck this rhetoric. I used to be a prostitute and I'm now a machinist. The two are not even remotely the same. Don't play dumb about not knowing what the term \"selling your body\" implies.", "Baboon tits? \ud83e\udd74", "They qualify as sex workers, just like onlyfans people do"]}
