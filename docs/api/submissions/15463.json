That's really annoying and rude to everyone in the restaurant", "NTA How embarrassing for you.

I don\u2019t understand the mentality of people who play videos with sound in public. Keep your volume off or wear headphones!", "NTA.

Your mom is the worst. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry this happened.", "NTA\n\nI've done the keep the kid happy with a device in a retail type setting many many times. If you are literally using an extra loud speaker to blast toddler music at anything other than a party for toddlers, you are an AH.\n\nHer response in the restaurant was literally so that no one would confront her. She dressed you down to intimidate the other patrons into accepting her behavior.\n\nEdit: OP you were completely right to tell her about how her behavior is rude.

Nobody wants to hear kids shows blasting at lunch.", "NTA. Why the hell does she need to blast cocomelon in a restaurant? What is a grown ass woman doing watching cocomelon anyhow?", "NTA. I know others usually say this and I usually disagree and I think this should be a last case but seems like a relationship you may want to cut off.", "NTA, and please go NC with mom and her boyfriend.", "NTA I'd be on bad terms with her, too lol", "As a parent, can confirm that Cocomelon songs should be reserved for black site torture use, not full blast in a restaurant.

Under no circumstances is that ok in a dense public setting. Ever. Congratulations on having more common sense and courtesy than your mom!", "NTA at all!
