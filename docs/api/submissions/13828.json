Like you said you can support them in other ways. They should be grateful for all you\u2019ve done.", "NTA At all. Your roommate is attempting to manipulate you. And put their \"eviction notice\" in writing. Maybe even talk to a lawyer about this, because depending on where you are, this could get very messy.", "NTA\n\n9 months total of FREE accommodation with a 2 month notice? Make sure you know that you are not the asshole and anyone who says otherwise, besides this friend, please feel free to open your home. \n\nPfft\u2026 you may even be doing them a favor by lighting a fire under their butts, they seem to have grown stagnant. \n\nIt is time my children! Pushes them out of nest.", "NTA, I was in the same situation last here, you give them more than enough time to find something. You are a good person \ud83d\ude01", "NTA. They're using you. I'm sorry", "NTA, maybe it will help to hear from someone who has been in your situation. \n\nI helped a friend move to our state to help them get out of a bad situation. I'm pretty severely disabled and the initial plan was that they would help with chores until they were settled in/found a new place. \n\nLong story short, they never helped with chores, in fact they made a lot of messes, and the initial plan of a few months turned into years. \n\nWe didn't charge any rent until the last year or two, but that was severely reduced-- like $200 when even a studio apartment was going for $800-$1200 in our area. I also gave them my car, since I couldn't use it and they felt unsafe on the bus. \n\nI honestly think, despite my good intentions, me not charging rent from the beginning may have done more harm than good. Because they couldn't manage their money at all, and thus they couldn't ever build up enough to afford to move. \n\nMy good intentions turned into chains that kept them from moving out, and the heavy burden of my generosity made them grow more uncomfortable around me and even generated resentment. \n\nI almost divorced due to sticking up for them, as my husband felt I was being taken advantage of. All their friends also said bad things about them living with us, which I'm sure damaged their reputation. \n\nAnyway, I don't regret helping but I do regret not thinking things through, which caused me to lose a friend. It's not that kindness is bad, but going overboard can harm you and then. It's better to help at a more reasonable level to prevent situations like mine.\n\n(PS, I found out about a great program for homeless youth in our area that takes 30% of their paycheck as rent, but when they leave the program in a few years, they get all the rent they paid to be used as their savings. This is great for those who don't necessarily need the rent money, and really sets someone up for success after they're on their own.)", "Nta. You sound like you were already super gracious. They were definitely taking advantage of your generosity.", "NTA! You have done all you can, and it sounds like you were super compassionate in telling them your boundary. It\u2019s hard to set those when the problem starts! I\u2019m sure everything was high emotion when they moved in, and I am proud of you for stating your boundaries now, and I am sending you all the strength to hold to them. You got this.", "NTA Thought they had more time. It's been 7 months. How much time did they expect to have? You gave them plenty of time and plenty of enough warning time. Stick to your deadline.", "Your friend is in a depression and is refusing to help themselves get out of it because they've created barriers they don't believe they can overcome. None of that is your responsibility to bear.\n\nStory time: When I was 23, I was your friend, but I was living with my egg donor. Eventually, my egg donor decided to sell the house and move. She did not tell me any of this was happening until three weeks before her own moving date when she said she was moving and I'm not coming with her.\n\nMy father? He gave me a list of shelters to go to. (My parents were long divorced)\n\nAt the time, I immediately got on social assistance and created an ad on a local buy/sell website seeking accommodations and listing my budget. Ironically, the house I moved into was being managed by the woman who would later become my wife (after I got my sh*t together)\n\nThe point is... no one can be responsible for your life but you, and sometimes a kick in the pants is needed. Literally, the only way she'll ever learn to be responsible for herself is to actually need to be responsible for herself.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
