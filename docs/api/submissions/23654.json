Every time someone asks to meet up and we finally find a date everyone is available, one of the moms always asks if they can bring their child, or children. Its usually 1 of 2 moms, as the third actually wants to have a kid free evening. And before anyone else can answer, the other mom says yes. All 3 moms have husbands who can watch their kids. Most of them also have both sets of grandparents who are involved. But somehow they never manage to find someone who can \"babysit\", as they call it. \n\nSo at this point I've stopped answering until they've set a time and place, someone has asked about kids, and I say I can't make it. I hang out with them one on one, or in smaller groups instead. \n\nWell a few days ago we agreed to finally meet up. No one had asked about kids and we were having a bbq and wine night. We'll, who shows up with their 8 year old? Yep, one of the moms. I clearly didn't hide my annoyance and one of the girls asked me why. I just waved it off and 30 min later I excused myself and left. Said I didn't feel well. In those 30 min we hadn't had any \"adult talk\", we were just entertaining the kid. I would rather go home thsn do this for another 3-4 hours. \n\nAfter I left, I think they realised this was a pattern and I got text from most of the girls in the group. Some calling me an asshole, others just saying they were annoyed with me for leaving, while the third mom having my back, and asked to meet up later that week to have a proper wine night. \n\nI don't hate kids at all.

There SHOULD be an opportunity for some \"adults only\" time, but the reality is that this will be impossible more than very occasionally, especially when young kids are involved. If 5 of the 7 women in this group have young kids, it's highly unlikely that all 5 of them will be able to find someone to watch their kids on the same night - even if their husbands are great about that sort of thing, it's just not that easy to align 5 separate households without a LOT of warning.\n\nIt is very common for friends to drift apart when all the couples aren't having kids. This may be what you're looking at, unfortunately. It's not your fault, nor is it theirs, but it is a pretty common thing.", "NTA. The mom in this last case was an AH for bringing her kids uninvited but it would have helped to speak up and directly request for kids free events.

I have kids but if I am hanging out with my friends I do not want my kids with me. I think there is a time for kid centered events and time for kid free events. You are NTA for not wanting to have to deal with kids when socializing with friends. I do think you may need to develop a new friend group that is more aligned with your desire for kid free hanging out time.", "Nta. \n\nAs someone who works with children almost every week day I understand wanting to have some adult time. \n\nBeing that the majority of your friends are soon-to-be or full-time mothers is always gonna make making plans more difficult.

Just like it's okay for people to not want to spend their free time around animals. Everyone has different tastes and that's okay.\n\nWould it have been good to communicate? In a perfect world yes, however, most parents act like the world should be grateful for their progeny so it likely would have ended up with OP still being called an asshole.\n\nI've moved around a lot so I've never really had a chance to have a long-time group of friends but as far as I can tell lifelong friend groups only exist in movies.

If your friends can\u2019t hang out with you without their kids, they\u2019re not really your friends.", "NAH\n\nAnd I say that as someone who has no kids but feels pretty much the opposite to you: I also spent most of my career working with kids (though I'm now \"retired\" for reasons of disability) and adore the opportunity to hang out with my friends' kids, and while of course I'm happy to hang out with \"just us adults\" (at nearly 50 years old I do not REQUIRE the company of kids to have fun, LOL), I fully admit that I tend to look forward even more to those occasions where I know the kids will be included. \n\nBut there are no AHs here. Some people are edging perilously close, mind you: the parents who assume that EVERYONE welcomes their kids at a \"wine and BBQ\" night with friends just because one friend says yes (they should definitely have made sure that everyone, or at least most  of the gang, were in agreement); but also you for assuming that people's partners or their own parents are always available to watch the kids (safer assumption is that their husbands and parents also have social lives and things they'd rather be doing . . . ). Ultimately, though, it's a matter of personal preference, and that's not really an AH situation.\n\nYou'd rather not hang out with kids there, so you choose not to. Not an AH for that.

Nothing kills a good time more than having kids around.", "Since they are your friends have honest conversations with them about why can't they leave their children with their dads or with somebody else for just one night.

Or sometimes because they don't trust anybody else but themselves with their kids.", "NTA (although somewhat passive aggressive).  OP should suggest hosting the next friend night with the stipulation that it is kid free (explain the rationale that you just want an adult conversation after working with kids).  See who shows up.

It's fine if you don't want to hang out with your friends' kids. But you need to use your big girl words and tell them. As it stands, you look really rude and the mom who brought her kids probably took it personally. \n\nIf you want kid-free time with the girls, and everyone else is fine with kids coming, it's going to be on you to plan a specifically kid-free event. But at this point, you may not get any of the moms to come.\n\nJust because everyone has husbands and grands around to watch the kids, doesn't negate the fact that all those people have prior commitments, the kids are young and go through weird phases, and there's a lot of intrinsic guilt about leaving your kids home to go have fun.

I also don't have kids and don't really like hanging around them. But you outright left 30 minutes into a gathering after getting super annoyed even before that half-hour was up.\n\nIf you get this upset about a single eight-year-old less than half an hour into a gathering with multiple adults, then this is a boundary thing that you need to discuss with your friends so they know not to include you in things with *any* kids involved. It doesn't sound like you are being assertive about it. It sounds like you're just being petulant and throwing fits when people show up with kids. Because I have two dear friends with kids in elementary school, and they come around to gatherings all the time. They interrupt like maybe every 15-45 minutes but it's not that bad.\n\nIf that level of child interaction taxes you so much, then it's up to you to be clearer with your expectations rather than storming off at a gathering, making yourself the center of attention.

Although I understand where you coming from, I think your reaction is kind of aggressive and over the top. For example, i find it difficult to imagine that an 8 year old needed all 7 of you to entertain it all night. You could relax and have a conversation with any of the other women there who were not occupied with the kid. In addition, you never asked your friends to have a night out, specifically child free.

So adjust and find common ground.", "YTA\nNot for wanting to meet your friends without their children but for not communicating it. Sounds like passive-aggressive behavior.

Not wanting to hang out with kids is totally fine, but if you're part of a group where most of the people have kids, you are setting yourself up for failure by refusing to ever be around their kids. With such a large group, it's inevitable that most hang-outs will end up with a kid being there because it's not always easy to coordinate childcare, and if most of the group doesn't mind having kids around when they hang out, that's going to become the standard. Not to mention you handled this super passive aggressively instead of just being straightforward and saying you'd prefer to come hang out when the kids aren't around.

So I usually had a tasty lunch the day after. \n\nAnd the kids were pretty great, two were little bundles of nuclear powered hyper, but if I made sure the activity was something energetic for at least some of the time, that would work itself out.\n\nYears later, I am Facebook friends with three of those kids (and all of their moms, which is how I became friends with them, they sent me invites and I accepted) and apparently they are a friend group themselves now, which is super fun because occasionally they post pics of their own social gatherings and I get to see \"the babies\" all grown up. (-weep- im so old)\n\nI really don't see why group sitters aren't more common for friend groups. All of the ladies (even the childfree, never gonna have kids ever, lady for some reason?) paid equally so they got a great deal individually.

What does the child's age have to do with the parent's ages?  Their comment is referring to the parent's ages because younger parents usually find themselves in this social dilemma.

In OP\u2019s situation, they have to find a date where all seven people are free, which is hard enough without the childcare aspect. Unexpected things happen when you have kids and childcare can fall through. I personally don\u2019t have kids, but I know with my parent friends I always have to be ready that they might not be able to make if because of a child-related problem, or that they might show up with them. I\u2019ve distanced myself from the ones that always show up with their kids or consistently cancel all the time, but I understand that their children are the priority and people sometimes just drift apart.

It\u2019s gotten to where we try to have adult get-togethers when they\u2019re out of town because they would be positively insulted if we suggested not bringing her and her brother.

But the reason I lean more to ESH is that that\u2019s life, and if you don\u2019t want to lose lifelong friends, one has to accept some changes - unless of course as you said, the children are rude or behave like animals. Some of my friends had kids before I did, and yeah some things changed, but I just kept going as I always did. Now that I have a daughter, and adults are around, if she wants to listen, she does. But I make sure to tell her we are having an adult conversation so if bored, you can go watch tv in another room or play but if you\u2019re out here, don\u2019t interrupt us or if you want to chime in, wait until the person is done talking. \n\nAnd because she is growing up like this - hey, the adults will actually engage her as well since I want her to be used to being around adults.

This friend group doesn't care about OP's feelings, and clearly isn't willing to make room for a differing perspective. Maybe that pressure is mostly coming from the same one or two more dominant people, and maybe the other people in the group just don't want to speak up and get harassing texts like OP did, and are more willing to compromise and put up with the kid(s) than the harassment, for the sake of spending time with the friends even with kids around, and keeping the peace. Maybe they all genuinely feel the same way about it. With OP describing themselves as the only *childfree* one, and the others as either childless, child-having, or child-on-the-way, yet OP does work with kids as a job, it seems that OP genuinely doesn't hate kids, but has made a concrete life decision that the others do not share, to *not* involve kids in their free time, their adult time. That is a decision and a boundary they are entitled to. The friend group has made it clear their hangouts will not respect even the mere idea of this boundary, making any more assertive boundary-setting by OP clearly and firmly unwelcome and pretty pointless. The resulting message received from the friend group's behavior is that they only value OP if they can behave as Part Of The MOM Group, and accept only having actual child-free nights when the MOMS decide they're willing to. If that's how they want to run their group, they're just as entitled to that. And the consequence for that is they don't get to hang out with the friend they refuse to make adequate adult space for. If they're bummed out by that, they'll do something about it. If not, there are more considerate people out there who *will* make space for adults.\n\nSpeaking as another childfree person, it sucks to realize that your friends, as a group and as individuals, the whole time you knew and valued them as independent, untethered adults and not \"future parents\", all along they actually valued \"growing their family \\[someday\\]\" the most, far over fostering and engaging in those adult-only friendships and activities with you long-term, and with the other friends as an adult group. They were only using adult time with you as a time-filler until they could have kids, and then you got squeezed off to the time they could *make* for you when one of the other responsible parties could watch the children, except... they still brought the children, whose presence they expect all the adults to unanimously just cheerfully accept and engage with as a part of the friend group as if they were always and obviously expected to be added from the beginning. \"Why won't you make space for my child in our adult friend group?! You should have known before I had them, when you and I started forming important lasting bonds as adults, that my kids and I are a package deal!! You don't get to draw a line here saying that you never ever wanted or agreed to that!! Everyone else who decided to have kids in their own homes in their non-work time 24/7 is okay with \\[my\\] children being involved in their free time!!!\" It's entitled, presumptuous, and disrespectful, to the adult lives and desires of people that they previously claimed to care for as adult friends; people whose independent perspectives and plans and goals and time these people claimed to value *by* calling you a friend, but now place far below \"watch your mouth and don't get too drunk, I brought my kid.\"\n\nNTA", "She told a white lie on the spot to not hurt their feelings.

It started off as something about half the people brought their kids to and had them play while we talked about the books.\n\nOne of the teachers brought up that she had been hoping book club would be a break from kids, we all talked about it, and after that everyone left their kids at home or didn't come if they couldn't get childcare.\n\nIt wasn't a fight and no one took offense.  There's no guarantee that OP bringing the subject up would get the group to agree to it, but it's also not a given that it would start a conflict.\n\nOP's friendships will not survive OP being deeply uncomfortable with things and refusing to express a preference in favor of just removing herself from the friendships.", "Right.  But I'd still think the better etiquette would be to ask if you can bring the kids, as opposed to just bringing them and assuming its ok.", "OMG I hate this , the child takes over and honestly ruins the get together. I love my kids but would never subject my friends to that.", "Yeah, I always make the effort at first because I do have friends who struggled at first (understandably, its a huge life change) but then learned balance. However, it becomes clear after a few years that some friendships are just too far gone.", "I will never forget the September day when a sophomore walked into my classroom and told me, \"You taught my mother!\"  It ranks right up there with the day I called a parent because a student was neglecting homework. I began to explain my expectations for my students only to be informed that it was unnecessary because the mother was a former student.", "My cousin had a surreal moment of his own in a bar. He walked in with his wife to have a few drinks after dinner, his daughter was there and he realized she was old enough to be there.", "I think one has the right to be upset about it precisely because it is one of those things that can\u2019t be easily said out loud.\n\nYou have the right to bring your kid, and I have the right to be annoyed.  Because the thing is, even if say something about it, people often *have* to bring kids along, so nothing can be done about it. \n\nI can tell you as someone who has hosted *many* child-free events\u2014people bring their kids every single time.  At least one person does, every single time.\n\nSo that\u2019s why I chalk it up to one of those things that can\u2019t always be said.  \n\nThere are, I believe, situations in life that just can\u2019t be righted or addressed, even with open and honest communication, and they test friendships and one\u2019s patience.  But people get through them\u2014or they don\u2019t.", "If I were the husband, I'd have taken the car and kids and gone some place else nearby", ">Maybe dad has work to finish, maybe he has his own plans.  I don't know why it's default, there's another parent\n\nSo his plans are more important than hers...?\n\n> Maybe mom works and doesn't see their kid a lot.\n\nThen don't go out and spend that time with the kid, simple as that.", "American here and I agree with you. I've had PLENTY of wine and BBQ nights with kids afoot.  Not sure why anyone would assume an event with alcohol is a child-free event. Literally every family BBQ we have involves alcohol and children. We are responsible adults, the parents watch their own consumption of alcohol so they can care for their children. The idea that the \"BBQ+wine=no kids\" is a huge leap ppl are making.", "The distinction shows that OP is the odd one out. Everyone else in the group likes/wants children, and at some point OP is going to be the only one without children.", "It distinguishes between people who never want to have kids, and people who may or may not want them, but don't have them currently regardless. So OP being childfree means she will never want children, while her friend who is childless may eventually have a child, but isn't actively pregnant or anything yet. \n\nThis is tangentally relevant to a discussion where OP feels like they aren't getting the child free experience they want because everyone else in the group seems fine with kids being involved during most of the events. I suspect based on the animosity in this whole situation that there's more to it than that though", "Wait til you\u2019re\u2026retired and on social security and inside you\u2019re still 35 or so, wondering who that gray haired grandma in the window reflection is. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude1f\ud83d\ude04", "A lot of people choose based on hope/promises/expectations instead of the evidence in front of them - or they genuinely believe it's unreasonable to hope for a man who acts like a partner instead of a large child with a paycheck.", "He cooked you dinner!? Wow. My husband cooked me dinner loads before we were married. He worked like fuck to make sure we made rent while I had a part-time job because 'I didn't need to work full-time, he'd take care of me'. He used to bring me home steaks and seafood (even though he was vegetarian), red wine and flowers, all the time. He was THE most loving, attentive partner I'd ever known in my life. All of our friends said we were made for each other. \n\nWhen we had kids, he got up through the night and changed the diapers while I breastfed. He did a tremendous amount of housework while ensuring that all I had to do was feed and look after our kids. ALL I had to do. \n\nAfter the kids came along, we had nights out together, but if I was invited for a girls night (not even out at a bar or club, literally at my best friends house) he would go quiet. For days. Ask why I felt I needed to go. I said it's my friends (and to be fair they were his friends too, when we met my friends became his friends and vice versa) but these were my girlfriends. I said I had no problem with him going out with his friends. I suggested one night each a month while the other watched the kids (that's reasonable, right?) And he said to me 'i don't need to do that, but if that's what you feel you have to do'...then he literally didn't speak to me for days. I didn't do it.\n\nAnd that was just the beginning. And this was 5 YEARS in.\n\nAnd what followed that was that in all this time I had thought he was doing everything for me because he loved me, what he was actually doing was eroding my self-confidence, my ability to cope with anything independently. When I married him, the mask well and truly slipped, and once I saw it, and of course called him out on it, it was counteracted with the most horrendously, mind-twisting abuse that you can imagine. I was so subsumed by it that I became an absolute shell of a person. I was beat up and blamed for it. I went from being \"the most amazing mother\" to \"the kids would get removed by social services if it wasn't for me being here, you can't even look after them yourself\".\n\nI got away 4 years ago now, and I am still suffering. \n\nPeople aren't always what they seem, and people like that can well and truly play the long game.", "Tbf, the post is written by child free OP, so it may just be her terminology rather than theirs.", "> I don't see how not wanting to be around kids sometimes is so offensive to parents lol\n\nBecause certain kinds of parents see their kids as the absolute most precious little angels on the planet and literally cannot fathom why anyone would not want them around at any given point in time, if you don't want to be around their kids then you must HATE not only children but specifically *their* children.\n\nThe number of friends I've lost to that school of thought, man... I don't hate kids at all, I just don't want to spend every single social event with them. It's exhausting.", "True! My Asian parents took us everywhere and no one ever thought it was weird. No one ever asked if they could bring the kids either.", "I think in general people like giving gifts but don\u2019t like being asked for them.

Those things I can offer but if you ask for I\u2019m gonna side eye the hell out of you. \n\nFor me it\u2019s cleaning up dog poop. My stepmom has a big dog who once in awhile will crap on the floor (always a human\u2019s fault. Someone did not let her out in time, she\u2019s a middle aged lady and will hold it as long as doggedly possible) and every time it happens I 9.9/10 I pick it up. I\u2019d at every single time but I\u2019m sure someone else has\u2026 I think?\n\nAnyway, it\u2019s not my dog and it\u2019s gross, but it would be really hard on my stepmom or pop to bend over and get it, even if they were the one to oversleep and cause it. I do it gladly and without a bit of resentment. \n\nBut I realized (in a dream stupidly enough, I dreamed someone told me to pick up dog doodoo) if someone TOLD me to do that I\u2019d be pretty ticked off since I let the dang dogs out regularly. \n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, the childfree lady occasionally brought her dogs to be watched (they were angelic, just would trot around wagging their tails and trying to play too) and when she paid me it was always with a smile and no annoyance I can remember, so I don\u2019t think she resented the gift to her friends, or whatever their arrangement was. (To be clear, I usually got paid by the lady homeowner, but a few times a different lady would pay me or two ladies would each hand me money, equaling what I was owed. I also got tipped sometimes?)\n\nI just remember Carol didn\u2019t have kids but she did give me money a couple times. \n\nMaybe she had agreed to pay part of my wages because I was watching her dog, maybe she did it to help out a friend or two, but she was a really nice lady.", "It's not always that simple. It takes time to make sure you're in a financially viable situation etc etc.", "This is how I feel about it. I acknowledge that my partner and I put a lot of effort into growing together into people who both put high effort into parenting and generally running the ship. But we were also 21 and 22 when we got together and didn't really have great models from which to base our relationship on, so we were going in blind.\n\nSo yeah! I can say I've worked hard, but I've also had a degree of luck that someone I met when I was practically a baby was a good choice!", "Absolutely correct! Sometimes you can do everything right with all due diligence and still get screwed. Anyone should consider themselves lucky for falling in love with a true partner.", "Also sadly the amount of men that are true equal partners is incredibly low.

It's normal for us (and we are all in our 30s).", "It's because if someone expects generosity it means they are selfish, self-involved or something of the sort. Generosity is viewed as spontaneous and unexpected, or it doesn't come from the heart and the person receiving it is spoiled."]}
