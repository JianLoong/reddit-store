I've seen all of them maybe twice in the last year, and we all live in the same city. Every time someone asks to meet up and we finally find a date everyone is available, one of the moms always asks if they can bring their child, or children. Its usually 1 of 2 moms, as the third actually wants to have a kid free evening. And before anyone else can answer, the other mom says yes. All 3 moms have husbands who can watch their kids. Most of them also have both sets of grandparents who are involved. But somehow they never manage to find someone who can \"babysit\", as they call it. \n\nSo at this point I've stopped answering until they've set a time and place, someone has asked about kids, and I say I can't make it. I hang out with them one on one, or in smaller groups instead. \n\nWell a few days ago we agreed to finally meet up. No one had asked about kids and we were having a bbq and wine night. We'll, who shows up with their 8 year old? Yep, one of the moms. I clearly didn't hide my annoyance and one of the girls asked me why. I just waved it off and 30 min later I excused myself and left. Said I didn't feel well. In those 30 min we hadn't had any \"adult talk\", we were just entertaining the kid. I would rather go home thsn do this for another 3-4 hours. \n\nAfter I left, I think they realised this was a pattern and I got text from most of the girls in the group. Some calling me an asshole, others just saying they were annoyed with me for leaving, while the third mom having my back, and asked to meet up later that week to have a proper wine night. \n\nI don't hate kids at all.

There SHOULD be an opportunity for some \"adults only\" time, but the reality is that this will be impossible more than very occasionally, especially when young kids are involved. If 5 of the 7 women in this group have young kids, it's highly unlikely that all 5 of them will be able to find someone to watch their kids on the same night - even if their husbands are great about that sort of thing, it's just not that easy to align 5 separate households without a LOT of warning.\n\nIt is very common for friends to drift apart when all the couples aren't having kids. This may be what you're looking at, unfortunately. It's not your fault, nor is it theirs, but it is a pretty common thing.", "NTA. The mom in this last case was an AH for bringing her kids uninvited but it would have helped to speak up and directly request for kids free events. Instead of waiting for the moms to invite their kids, can you explicitly ask for the activity to be child-free?

I have kids but if I am hanging out with my friends I do not want my kids with me. I think there is a time for kid centered events and time for kid free events. You are NTA for not wanting to have to deal with kids when socializing with friends. I do think you may need to develop a new friend group that is more aligned with your desire for kid free hanging out time.", "Nta. \n\nAs someone who works with children almost every week day I understand wanting to have some adult time. \n\nBeing that the majority of your friends are soon-to-be or full-time mothers is always gonna make making plans more difficult.

Not saying get rid of your friends but maybe making friends with more women who don't have kids might make things easier on you.", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to not want to spend your free time around kids. Just like it's okay for people to not want to spend their free time around animals. Everyone has different tastes and that's okay.\n\nWould it have been good to communicate? In a perfect world yes, however, most parents act like the world should be grateful for their progeny so it likely would have ended up with OP still being called an asshole.\n\nI've moved around a lot so I've never really had a chance to have a long-time group of friends but as far as I can tell lifelong friend groups only exist in movies. Maybe it's time to move on?", "NTA.  It\u2019s their choice to bring their kids, and it\u2019s your choice to keep dubbing those events.", "NTA. If your friends can\u2019t hang out with you without their kids, they\u2019re not really your friends.", "NAH\n\nAnd I say that as someone who has no kids but feels pretty much the opposite to you: I also spent most of my career working with kids (though I'm now \"retired\" for reasons of disability) and adore the opportunity to hang out with my friends' kids, and while of course I'm happy to hang out with \"just us adults\" (at nearly 50 years old I do not REQUIRE the company of kids to have fun, LOL), I fully admit that I tend to look forward even more to those occasions where I know the kids will be included. \n\nBut there are no AHs here. Some people are edging perilously close, mind you: the parents who assume that EVERYONE welcomes their kids at a \"wine and BBQ\" night with friends just because one friend says yes (they should definitely have made sure that everyone, or at least most  of the gang, were in agreement); but also you for assuming that people's partners or their own parents are always available to watch the kids (safer assumption is that their husbands and parents also have social lives and things they'd rather be doing . . . ). Ultimately, though, it's a matter of personal preference, and that's not really an AH situation.\n\nYou'd rather not hang out with kids there, so you choose not to. Not an AH for that.

Nothing kills a good time more than having kids around.", "Since they are your friends have honest conversations with them about why can't they leave their children with their dads or with somebody else for just one night. Sometimes is because their partners ''can't'' be alone with their kids (as in they throw tantrums if they are left alone with their own kids) and somethimes are the moms that can't be apart of their kids for too long because they are too attached to them. Or sometimes because they don't trust anybody else but themselves with their kids.", "NTA (although somewhat passive aggressive).  OP should suggest hosting the next friend night with the stipulation that it is kid free (explain the rationale that you just want an adult conversation after working with kids).  See who shows up.  The friend group is changing and a declared kid free night will either cause the group to come together or naturally splinter.  \nIMO it is already naturally splintering.", "NTA- Any event happening at night/specifically mentioning alcohol should be assumed kid free.

It's fine if you don't want to hang out with your friends' kids. But you need to use your big girl words and tell them. As it stands, you look really rude and the mom who brought her kids probably took it personally. \n\nIf you want kid-free time with the girls, and everyone else is fine with kids coming, it's going to be on you to plan a specifically kid-free event. But at this point, you may not get any of the moms to come.\n\nJust because everyone has husbands and grands around to watch the kids, doesn't negate the fact that all those people have prior commitments, the kids are young and go through weird phases, and there's a lot of intrinsic guilt about leaving your kids home to go have fun.

I also don't have kids and don't really like hanging around them. But you outright left 30 minutes into a gathering after getting super annoyed even before that half-hour was up.\n\nIf you get this upset about a single eight-year-old less than half an hour into a gathering with multiple adults, then this is a boundary thing that you need to discuss with your friends so they know not to include you in things with *any* kids involved. It doesn't sound like you are being assertive about it. It sounds like you're just being petulant and throwing fits when people show up with kids. Because I have two dear friends with kids in elementary school, and they come around to gatherings all the time. They interrupt like maybe every 15-45 minutes but it's not that bad.\n\nIf that level of child interaction taxes you so much, then it's up to you to be clearer with your expectations rather than storming off at a gathering, making yourself the center of attention.

Although I understand where you coming from, I think your reaction is kind of aggressive and over the top. For example, i find it difficult to imagine that an 8 year old needed all 7 of you to entertain it all night. You could relax and have a conversation with any of the other women there who were not occupied with the kid. In addition, you never asked your friends to have a night out, specifically child free. This is a communication problem. Talk to them,discuss it and have in mind that leaving a kid to go out, it's difficult to happen for 5 mothers at the same night. So adjust and find common ground.", "YTA\nNot for wanting to meet your friends without their children but for not communicating it. Sounds like passive-aggressive behavior.

Not wanting to hang out with kids is totally fine, but if you're part of a group where most of the people have kids, you are setting yourself up for failure by refusing to ever be around their kids. With such a large group, it's inevitable that most hang-outs will end up with a kid being there because it's not always easy to coordinate childcare, and if most of the group doesn't mind having kids around when they hang out, that's going to become the standard. Not to mention you handled this super passive aggressively instead of just being straightforward and saying you'd prefer to come hang out when the kids aren't around.
