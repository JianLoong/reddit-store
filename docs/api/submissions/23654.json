Every time someone asks to meet up and we finally find a date everyone is available, one of the moms always asks if they can bring their child, or children. Its usually 1 of 2 moms, as the third actually wants to have a kid free evening. And before anyone else can answer, the other mom says yes. All 3 moms have husbands who can watch their kids. Most of them also have both sets of grandparents who are involved. But somehow they never manage to find someone who can \"babysit\", as they call it. \n\nSo at this point I've stopped answering until they've set a time and place, someone has asked about kids, and I say I can't make it. I hang out with them one on one, or in smaller groups instead. \n\nWell a few days ago we agreed to finally meet up. No one had asked about kids and we were having a bbq and wine night. We'll, who shows up with their 8 year old? Yep, one of the moms. I clearly didn't hide my annoyance and one of the girls asked me why. I just waved it off and 30 min later I excused myself and left. Said I didn't feel well. In those 30 min we hadn't had any \"adult talk\", we were just entertaining the kid. I would rather go home thsn do this for another 3-4 hours. \n\nAfter I left, I think they realised this was a pattern and I got text from most of the girls in the group. Some calling me an asshole, others just saying they were annoyed with me for leaving, while the third mom having my back, and asked to meet up later that week to have a proper wine night. \n\nI don't hate kids at all.

There SHOULD be an opportunity for some \"adults only\" time, but the reality is that this will be impossible more than very occasionally, especially when young kids are involved. If 5 of the 7 women in this group have young kids, it's highly unlikely that all 5 of them will be able to find someone to watch their kids on the same night - even if their husbands are great about that sort of thing, it's just not that easy to align 5 separate households without a LOT of warning.\n\nIt is very common for friends to drift apart when all the couples aren't having kids. This may be what you're looking at, unfortunately. It's not your fault, nor is it theirs, but it is a pretty common thing.", "NTA. The mom in this last case was an AH for bringing her kids uninvited but it would have helped to speak up and directly request for kids free events.

I have kids but if I am hanging out with my friends I do not want my kids with me. I think there is a time for kid centered events and time for kid free events. You are NTA for not wanting to have to deal with kids when socializing with friends. I do think you may need to develop a new friend group that is more aligned with your desire for kid free hanging out time.", "Nta. \n\nAs someone who works with children almost every week day I understand wanting to have some adult time. \n\nBeing that the majority of your friends are soon-to-be or full-time mothers is always gonna make making plans more difficult.

Not saying get rid of your friends but maybe making friends with more women who don't have kids might make things easier on you.", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly reasonable to not want to spend your free time around kids. Just like it's okay for people to not want to spend their free time around animals. Everyone has different tastes and that's okay.\n\nWould it have been good to communicate? In a perfect world yes, however, most parents act like the world should be grateful for their progeny so it likely would have ended up with OP still being called an asshole.\n\nI've moved around a lot so I've never really had a chance to have a long-time group of friends but as far as I can tell lifelong friend groups only exist in movies. Maybe it's time to move on?", "NTA.  It\u2019s their choice to bring their kids, and it\u2019s your choice to keep dubbing those events.", "NTA. If your friends can\u2019t hang out with you without their kids, they\u2019re not really your friends.", "NAH\n\nAnd I say that as someone who has no kids but feels pretty much the opposite to you: I also spent most of my career working with kids (though I'm now \"retired\" for reasons of disability) and adore the opportunity to hang out with my friends' kids, and while of course I'm happy to hang out with \"just us adults\" (at nearly 50 years old I do not REQUIRE the company of kids to have fun, LOL), I fully admit that I tend to look forward even more to those occasions where I know the kids will be included. \n\nBut there are no AHs here. Some people are edging perilously close, mind you: the parents who assume that EVERYONE welcomes their kids at a \"wine and BBQ\" night with friends just because one friend says yes (they should definitely have made sure that everyone, or at least most  of the gang, were in agreement); but also you for assuming that people's partners or their own parents are always available to watch the kids (safer assumption is that their husbands and parents also have social lives and things they'd rather be doing . . . ). Ultimately, though, it's a matter of personal preference, and that's not really an AH situation.\n\nYou'd rather not hang out with kids there, so you choose not to. Not an AH for that.

Nothing kills a good time more than having kids around.", "Since they are your friends have honest conversations with them about why can't they leave their children with their dads or with somebody else for just one night. Sometimes is because their partners ''can't'' be alone with their kids (as in they throw tantrums if they are left alone with their own kids) and somethimes are the moms that can't be apart of their kids for too long because they are too attached to them. Or sometimes because they don't trust anybody else but themselves with their kids.", "NTA (although somewhat passive aggressive).  OP should suggest hosting the next friend night with the stipulation that it is kid free (explain the rationale that you just want an adult conversation after working with kids).  See who shows up.

It's fine if you don't want to hang out with your friends' kids. But you need to use your big girl words and tell them. As it stands, you look really rude and the mom who brought her kids probably took it personally. \n\nIf you want kid-free time with the girls, and everyone else is fine with kids coming, it's going to be on you to plan a specifically kid-free event. But at this point, you may not get any of the moms to come.\n\nJust because everyone has husbands and grands around to watch the kids, doesn't negate the fact that all those people have prior commitments, the kids are young and go through weird phases, and there's a lot of intrinsic guilt about leaving your kids home to go have fun.

I also don't have kids and don't really like hanging around them. But you outright left 30 minutes into a gathering after getting super annoyed even before that half-hour was up.\n\nIf you get this upset about a single eight-year-old less than half an hour into a gathering with multiple adults, then this is a boundary thing that you need to discuss with your friends so they know not to include you in things with *any* kids involved. It doesn't sound like you are being assertive about it. It sounds like you're just being petulant and throwing fits when people show up with kids. Because I have two dear friends with kids in elementary school, and they come around to gatherings all the time. They interrupt like maybe every 15-45 minutes but it's not that bad.\n\nIf that level of child interaction taxes you so much, then it's up to you to be clearer with your expectations rather than storming off at a gathering, making yourself the center of attention.

Although I understand where you coming from, I think your reaction is kind of aggressive and over the top. For example, i find it difficult to imagine that an 8 year old needed all 7 of you to entertain it all night. You could relax and have a conversation with any of the other women there who were not occupied with the kid. In addition, you never asked your friends to have a night out, specifically child free.

So adjust and find common ground.", "YTA\nNot for wanting to meet your friends without their children but for not communicating it. Sounds like passive-aggressive behavior.

Not wanting to hang out with kids is totally fine, but if you're part of a group where most of the people have kids, you are setting yourself up for failure by refusing to ever be around their kids. With such a large group, it's inevitable that most hang-outs will end up with a kid being there because it's not always easy to coordinate childcare, and if most of the group doesn't mind having kids around when they hang out, that's going to become the standard. Not to mention you handled this super passive aggressively instead of just being straightforward and saying you'd prefer to come hang out when the kids aren't around.

So I usually had a tasty lunch the day after. \n\nAnd the kids were pretty great, two were little bundles of nuclear powered hyper, but if I made sure the activity was something energetic for at least some of the time, that would work itself out.\n\nYears later, I am Facebook friends with three of those kids (and all of their moms, which is how I became friends with them, they sent me invites and I accepted) and apparently they are a friend group themselves now, which is super fun because occasionally they post pics of their own social gatherings and I get to see \"the babies\" all grown up. (-weep- im so old)\n\nI really don't see why group sitters aren't more common for friend groups. All of the ladies (even the childfree, never gonna have kids ever, lady for some reason?) paid equally so they got a great deal individually.

What does the child's age have to do with the parent's ages?  Their comment is referring to the parent's ages because younger parents usually find themselves in this social dilemma.

In OP\u2019s situation, they have to find a date where all seven people are free, which is hard enough without the childcare aspect. Unexpected things happen when you have kids and childcare can fall through. I personally don\u2019t have kids, but I know with my parent friends I always have to be ready that they might not be able to make if because of a child-related problem, or that they might show up with them. I\u2019ve distanced myself from the ones that always show up with their kids or consistently cancel all the time, but I understand that their children are the priority and people sometimes just drift apart.

But the reason I lean more to ESH is that that\u2019s life, and if you don\u2019t want to lose lifelong friends, one has to accept some changes - unless of course as you said, the children are rude or behave like animals. Some of my friends had kids before I did, and yeah some things changed, but I just kept going as I always did. Now that I have a daughter, and adults are around, if she wants to listen, she does. But I make sure to tell her we are having an adult conversation so if bored, you can go watch tv in another room or play but if you\u2019re out here, don\u2019t interrupt us or if you want to chime in, wait until the person is done talking. \n\nAnd because she is growing up like this - hey, the adults will actually engage her as well since I want her to be used to being around adults.

This friend group doesn't care about OP's feelings, and clearly isn't willing to make room for a differing perspective. Maybe that pressure is mostly coming from the same one or two more dominant people, and maybe the other people in the group just don't want to speak up and get harassing texts like OP did, and are more willing to compromise and put up with the kid(s) than the harassment, for the sake of spending time with the friends even with kids around, and keeping the peace. Maybe they all genuinely feel the same way about it. With OP describing themselves as the only *childfree* one, and the others as either childless, child-having, or child-on-the-way, yet OP does work with kids as a job, it seems that OP genuinely doesn't hate kids, but has made a concrete life decision that the others do not share, to *not* involve kids in their free time, their adult time. That is a decision and a boundary they are entitled to. The friend group has made it clear their hangouts will not respect even the mere idea of this boundary, making any more assertive boundary-setting by OP clearly and firmly unwelcome and pretty pointless. The resulting message received from the friend group's behavior is that they only value OP if they can behave as Part Of The MOM Group, and accept only having actual child-free nights when the MOMS decide they're willing to. If that's how they want to run their group, they're just as entitled to that. And the consequence for that is they don't get to hang out with the friend they refuse to make adequate adult space for. If they're bummed out by that, they'll do something about it. If not, there are more considerate people out there who *will* make space for adults.\n\nSpeaking as another childfree person, it sucks to realize that your friends, as a group and as individuals, the whole time you knew and valued them as independent, untethered adults and not \"future parents\", all along they actually valued \"growing their family \\[someday\\]\" the most, far over fostering and engaging in those adult-only friendships and activities with you long-term, and with the other friends as an adult group. They were only using adult time with you as a time-filler until they could have kids, and then you got squeezed off to the time they could *make* for you when one of the other responsible parties could watch the children, except... they still brought the children, whose presence they expect all the adults to unanimously just cheerfully accept and engage with as a part of the friend group as if they were always and obviously expected to be added from the beginning. \"Why won't you make space for my child in our adult friend group?! You should have known before I had them, when you and I started forming important lasting bonds as adults, that my kids and I are a package deal!! You don't get to draw a line here saying that you never ever wanted or agreed to that!! Everyone else who decided to have kids in their own homes in their non-work time 24/7 is okay with \\[my\\] children being involved in their free time!!!\" It's entitled, presumptuous, and disrespectful, to the adult lives and desires of people that they previously claimed to care for as adult friends; people whose independent perspectives and plans and goals and time these people claimed to value *by* calling you a friend, but now place far below \"watch your mouth and don't get too drunk, I brought my kid.\"\n\nNTA", "She told a white lie on the spot to not hurt their feelings.

This is the first time a child showed up unannounced and she left early.\n\nAlso, there are only 3 moms, and one of them ALSO had a problem with kids being at gatherings. She also wants to have adult gatherings and is considerate enough to find child care for her kids. It sounds like the other two moms are the problem in that they keep trying to bring their kids to these gatherings despite have adequate options for childcare. One will ask if they can bring their kid and the other will immediately jump in to say \"Yes, absolutely.\" It may just be that the other women, like OP, don't want to be framed as the bad guy by straight out saying no, especially after the other mom had already said yes.", "Again, the quote I quoted shows the MO of the group. When kids are coming it is announced. OP wouldn't have been able to do what they've been doing unless that was the case. So up until this bbq / wine drinking evening, children were never there without letting everyone know beforehand. To suddenly just decide you don't need to do that any more is sheer entitlement whether you want to admit it or not. Just because I give you a beer whenever you ask at my house isn't a reason to think you can help yourself.", "Because the world revolves around parents, if you haven't figured it out.", "Why is it her job to ask if kids are ok? Why is the default bringing your children to a nighttime event where alcohol is involved? Mom should have asked if they were having kids around or not.\n\nMy friends do it with our husbands all the time. Oh, we're getting together... Dudes or no dudes? A few are single. I don't expect them to ask.", "There is a large chasm between repeatedly dumping your kid off on random adults to go get drunk, and leaving your child with somebody to attend an adults-only BBQ where they may get drunk.  Adults are allowed to enjoy themselves without their kids.  It sounds in your situation it was problematic and left a lasting impression, and I'm sorry about that.", "It is definitely an all too prevalent issue that can be complicated but these are theoretically her friends. If she doesn't feel like she can say that because their reaction will be bad then are they really friends? Or want to be?\n\nI'm not even old but I'm too old for passive aggressive nonsense like this and also the moms constantly asking to bring or just bringing their kids isn't good behavior either, like all of yall grow up, use your words and your adult brains and communicate, jesus.", "Oh I agree! But if nobody ever speaks up and says \"actually that's not okay with me\" how are they supposed to know it *isn't*?", "Yeah! I have multiple sisters that work with kids and it amazes me two of them still had their own.", "It is fine, but she seems to want to remain friends with them, even if she's comfortable with a slightly looser, casual relationship. But the thing with people is they don't act like you would expect, so she may need to compromise if she wants to maintain any kind of connection to all of them. One compromise might be actually having a serious civil conversation about boundaries and what form their friendship takes, instead of all pretending to be mind readers.", "OP has every right to do so.\n\nOthers \\*springing\\* kids on a meetup that's PRESUMED to be child-free because nobody asked if bringing kids is okay ARE AT FAULT.", "It's falling apart because of OP? Wow is that a disingenuous reading of this.", "Bruh, you fought a good fight, but I think we both need to accept that Redditors are children that think confronting other people and asserting themselves to clear up miscommunications before they happen and you storm off like a child is way too much to ask.", "> Children have been involved in all their group activities at least in the last year. Precedence doesn't mean it can't change,\n\nSo you are contradicting yourself, plus you do not understand the word \u201cprecedence \u201c.\n\nYou were the one that said (to paraphrase ) \u201cchange can\u2019t happen because of precedence \u201c.  Yet change had happened. For years there were no children. Then there were, but not always.\n\nSo you are now arguing with me, saying what I said.\n\nAs for your expectations, they are not the expectations of others, nor OP.", "Wine night means no kids, friend. Come on.", "Does your friend ask if she can bring the boyfriend?", "People do get defensive over their children. That's a pretty normal thing to say like if somebody is treating your child like theyre a nuisance or an a******, you're going to feel some kind of way. But there are parents who do understand when you're not being a jerk about letting them know you desire a child free night. These are two different things and this person clearly made that distinction and you only quoted part of it.", "What's funny? People can be defensive over there children and also want space from them? \n\nWrong? Far from wrong. Kid", "Well maybe it\u2019s just something she has said to us rather than them, about how they could find sitters easily. Either way, the group is changing so I think she just has to accept it if she wants to hang out with them.\nOr do what she has been doing and do the 1 on 1s. It\u2019s unrealistic to expect everyone to get sitters for frequent group hang outs.", "Sounds like you have a group of friends that better understands when children are uninvited. OP's group has continually shown they do not operate like that, so it was incumbent upon OP to correct the record, not let other people plan stuff, not mention her boundaries, then storm off like a child.", "By asking people and by not assuming?\n\nIt was only the mother's who would say yes, before anyone could say anything..", "Well, I wouldn't have said that. I was echoing the other commenter's language and used quotation marks.\n\nBut also, yes, kind of. Not because she doesn't want to hang with the kids, but because she is choosing to avoid or leave their group activities because of the kids, while having *never spoken up about it.* OP has not tried to make plans with the group with the kids, and has taken to avoiding even making plans with the group because kids might be there (this is plainly in her post.)\n\nAnd when a kid unexpectedly (but frankly, unsurprisingly) showed up, she got pouty and left (also in her post.) She's icing out her own social group without even trying to just say \"hey let's plan a kid-free thing this month\" or even saying \"how about no kids this time?\" when someone explicitly asks if they can bring their kid.\n\nThat's the problem here.", "True, friend!\n\nAnd you know, I think the one thing I find more awkward and unpleasant at a social gathering than unexpected children is an adult who is gets weird and pouty and grumpy and won't say why.", "I didn't say change can't happen because of precedence (and no I am not using it in a literal sense.) I'm saying if a thing has happened a certain way a bunch of times, assume it might happen again the next time.\n\nIf a group of people, consisting of mostly mothers and mothers-to-be, has been gathering and generally always bringing their children, assume there may be a child present at any future gathering unless it's clearly stated to be child-free.\n\nI am also not arguing with you, just clarifying what I said re your interpretation. If you feel I am now saying what you are saying, then we are in agreement.", "Well, not to the mother in question. That's what I wouldn't have assumed here. That \"BBQ & wine night\" to me means the same thing as it does to a mom who likes to bring her kid everywhere.", "But she's not expecting everyone to get sitters, she's just not going when there will be kids there.  \n\nThis was the first time that there wasn't supposed to be any kids and someone brought their kid anyway. \n\nSo now the rest of the group has finally figured out that she always declines to go when there will be kids there. \n\nAnd now the group is freaking out about it when she never once demanded anything from them.", "It's not that children are uninvited, it's that the core group of people that got invited does not include their children. That's an important distinction.\n\nPeople are separate from their children. If I were to want to bring a friend to an event where they weren't invited directly, I would ask. It should be no different with kids.", "Yes, but if Mom A already asked the question, what good would it do if Mom B and C repeated it? \n\nIf two people in the chat answer, \u201eSure, no problem for me!\u201c and all the others who do have a problem say nothing - then you can\u2019t really blame anyone for assuming it\u2019s okay to bring the kids.", "This whole thread is so bemusing to me because I'm pretty notoriously childfree in my friend group but I know it's up to me to ask if the event *I did not plan* will have kids involved because you know what they say about making assumptions.", ">All 3 moms have husbands who can watch their kids. Most of them also have both sets of grandparents who are involved. But somehow they never manage to find someone who can \"babysit\", as they call it.\n\nOP absolutely is expecting them to get sitters. She said it herself.", "It's easier to bail. You either rock the boat with a different opinion or bail and try again at the next event. Seeing how OP got messages telling her she was wrong for leaving, I can see why she didn't say anything.\n\n>Yes, but if Mom A already asked the question, what good would it do if Mom B and C repeated it?", "Hey, me too! I've got my tubes tied, I revel in being childfree daily, and I don't even pretend to like other people's kids anymore (I will be nice to kids when I must interact with them, of course.) Maybe it's because of that intense aversion that I would just never, ever assume that a parent isn't bring their kid. I know parents who seem to feel that their kids are extensions of themselves.\n\nLike my friend and her boyfriend I hate to be around. I always ask if he's going to be there. If I liked him or even felt neutrally positive, I wouldn't ask, because it wouldn't affect whether I'd go or not. If I didn't ask and he showed up, I would only have myself to blame.", "She doesn't expect them to get babysitters, she just doesn't go if there's kids, but she doesn't get why the dads can't watch their kids for a night so their wives can catch up with college friends. The quotes are just mocking the concept of a dad babysitting their kids.", "She is lamenting that they don't bother doing it, not demanding that they do that."]}
