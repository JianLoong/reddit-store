If it\u2019s something I\u2019m really excited about I\u2019ll buy it but if it\u2019s just something that seems kind of interesting, I\u2019ll put it on hold, forget about it, and be pleasantly surprised when I get to pick it up. He\u2019s been repeatedly trying to convince me that it is silly to put myself on these long waiting lists when I can easily afford new books. I don\u2019t know why he cares, but he\u2019s so convinced that I\u2019m depriving myself and that it would be so much better to just buy the books.\n\nWe were talking about Prince Harry\u2019s autobiography. I wasn\u2019t initially going to read it, but decided to get on the bandwagon and check it out. There\u2019s a long waiting list at the library but that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not that into it. My boyfriend asked when I was going to read it and I said I\u2019m not sure maybe May? But it doesn\u2019t matter, it comes when it comes. He went on his thing about the library again and why don\u2019t I just buy the book because I\u2019m not poor, and I told him to stop.\n\nNext time I saw him, he had a gift for me and it was Prince Harry\u2019s book. He told me now I don\u2019t have to wait for it for no reason. If we hadn\u2019t had the previous conversations about buying books and he had reason to believe I really wanted to read this I would have thanked him and accepted it even though I didn\u2019t really want it as a gift, but I turned it down because this was clearly part of whatever weird agenda he has. I\u2019m really annoyed by this and I don\u2019t like him telling me what to do when he shouldn\u2019t even care about this. So I told him to take it back and that I\u2019d wait to get it later and that he needs to stop being so weird about me not wanting to buy every little thing.

He knows fine well that you are not into consumerism, that you don't like to buy every book you want to read and actually prefer to use the library. He's tried to get you to buy books in the past and you have expressly declined and made it clear you don't want to. \n\nThis wasn't a gift. This is him trying to correct your behavior to what he thinks is appropriate, and emotionally manipulating the crap out of you when he didn't succeed (that's what the whole \"you're ungrateful\" speech is about, he's just trying to punish you and make you feel bad, likely to get you to apologize, for not performing up to his desires). \n\nDo what you may with that info. But don't ignore the red flag, because it's there and it's pretty big.", "NTA. This has nothing to do with being cheap or poor; this is about him wanting to control you. He thinks *he* can decide what makes you happy\u2014but he can\u2019t, and it\u2019s annoying him, so he\u2019s putting the blame back on you by saying you\u2019re \u201cdepriving\u201d yourself. It\u2019s a weird way to try to dictate your emotions. He wanted you to be like, \u201cyes, you\u2019re right, I really AM happy to have the book now,\u201d and when you weren\u2019t, he got upset. I have a feeling this need of his to control your emotional state will get worse.", "I'm going to go with NTA. Normally, it's a bit of an asshole move to reject a gift if someone is just trying to be nice in getting it for you, but you've already made it more than clear that you don't want to buy most of the books. He shouldn't keep pushing you, and going against your wishes.\n\nHonestly, checking out books you're interested in from the library before buying them makes a lot of sense; what if you end up disliking the book? If you bought it without knowing, you'll have wasted money on it. With borrowing it, if you don't like it, all you have to do is return it.", "NTA. There are some things we just don\u2019t want to buy for ourselves or have as a gift. I get not wanting a bunch of books around as someone who loves reading, they do take up a lot of space and they\u2019re a pain in the ass to move if you have a big collection. I\u2019d try explain to him \u2018hey while I enjoy reading that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean I want to own every book I want to read.\u2019 Also OP highly recommend checking out the Libby app if you\u2019re in the states and have a library card, you can reserve books, movies, music etc at your library online and read ebooks on your phone for free just using your library card number.", "NTA. I think everyone saying otherwise is missing the point, which is that he bought you something that he knew you specifically didn't want. And then expected you to be grateful. You were clear about preferring to lend most books. Its rude of him to be so pushy when you were clear about what you want.", "NTA. This is very controlling behavior and an attempt to manipulate your enjoyment processes. Not a fan of his intentions, however masked they are.", "NTA. You are just not a \"consumer\", and your bf is. This is a considerable difference in personalities. If you can't get him to respect that you don't want to own every little thing you might ever have had the slightest interest in, then what else does he not understand, or respect?", "NTA.\n\nWere you ungrateful? No. You said you were fine with waiting and he should have respected that, not decide that he knew better than you did. \n\nPutting aside the fact you're helping your library, if you're not excited to buy a book right off the bat thats ok. It also saves you the trouble of having to get rid of a book that you found out you didn't enjoy or couldn't finish. BTDT but I have two local shops that buy books that I can unload at.", "The logic underneath this is not all that different to the reasons you might feel obliged to fake an orgasm. \n\nBuying a gift that the recipient expressly told you they didn't want is an asshole move. The recipient is put in the awkward position of being grateful for something that's kind of disrespectful. Gifts like that make the giver happy, not the recipient. I usually read that as a control issue, and you see this with partners who do not respect boundaries, or who are selfish lovers.\n\nNTA", "NTA and you both check (you and your boyfriend) your relationship because it doesn't sound like he knows how you work or wants to respect it.", "NTA\n\nThis dude is acting like the library killed his parents and that is weird. He also is steadfastly ignoring your feelings which is the much bigger issue", "NTA You made it clear how you want your reading to go: waiting and anticipating. He is trying to interfere in something that is in essence an individual undertaking.", "NTA. Books can accumulate and then you have to figure out what to do with them. Now you have to read that book just so you can get rid of it.", "NTA he thinks he knows what you need better then you and he isn't listening to your opinion.   \nHe doesn't have to understand it, he just needs to believe you and accept your view as a competent person.  \nIt would drive me mad", "NTA \n\nHere is what I would do. Every time there is a book that you want to read, put that money into a little savings account, or write yourself an IOU. Then one day use all that money to buy yourself something you really want but is a bit pricy. People who do not understand budgeting do not understand that this is how you can have so much more in life. Its also a way to show your bf that you do treat yourself, just in larger ways that mean more to you.  \n\nAs a side note, isn't it super annoying when you are with someone who loves video games and wants you to love it as well? I really don't like video games so I don't get it.", "NTA, I wanted to say slight TA, for refusing a gift, there were some ulterior motive to this gift. \n\nI think you need to have a conversation with him, let him know how you feel, and that he needs to get on board with how you feel. You wanting to wait on something doesn't impact him or even your relationship in the least. And I'm the exact same way, for instance I like gaming, I can do buy games right when they come out if I am super excited and been looking forward to it. But there are plenty of games I really want to play, I'll just wait until they go on sale and buy them then. It wouldn't break the bank for me to buy them new, by why spend 100 bucks on a game, when in a few months I can get it for half that or less.", "NTA I had an ex like this, the final straw he got me a replica of a sword from 1 of my favorite animes(bleach). The thing was my best friend's made me 1. He complained to his parents. They tried lecturing me. I explained  that the sword was for my cosplay.  He got called a dumbass & dumped.  & I got to fight 1 of my bad guys. I'd  rather be ungrateful than disrespectful in this instance.", "NTA, but why believe he has a \"weird agenda\"? He just wants to take care of you. Next time, accept the book, read it, and then donate it to the library. That will make you feel good.", "[deleted]", "NAH\n\nI can only comment on the book part here\n\nIf you even take the efforts to sign yourself for a book, it means youre interested in it. No one signs up for books if they dont have a lot of interest for it (I only do that when im very serious about a book, so this is just my opinion)\n\nIt does look as if you are just trying to save money so cant blame the bf", "He's right, refusing a gift is ungrateful. He likely had good intentions when buying it. On the other hand, he wasn't really listening to what you were saying, just bought the first thing he remembered you talking about. Is that a tendency he has? Ignore you, and/or correct your behavior? If so, he's an AH. If not, he's likely just absentminded, and wanted to make you smile.", "YTA- Softly. It was a gift. You are going to read the book eventually. You could have taken the book and put it away until May when you originally planned to read it. It sounds like your BF has a little \"fear of missing out\" and thinks you're gonna miss out, which you're completely okay with missing things it seems like. Just reassure him these are your choices and you like reading things at your own pace.", "Info: do you buy yourself anything for your hobbies?\n\nI know someone who will spend money on literally anyone but themself and it's frustrating because then you feel guilty for accepting or buying the things you like with your own money.", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I can relate, OP \u2014 I\u2019m obsessed with Libby and love my local library. Coming from a long line of pack rats, I\u2019m trying to reduce the amount of stuff I have, and that includes books. \n\nYour boyfriend seems to really lack the ability to empathize or even understand that not everyone feels the same way he does. He\u2019s clearly decided that his opinions are the correct ones, and that you need guidance to see things his way. It\u2019s weird and patronizing and kinda stupid, tbh. Are there other areas this comes out?", "It's a danger signal in that OP has made it clear she likes doing this with the library - she likes the serendipity of an interesting but not compelling title becoming available at a random time and reading it on that timetable.\n\nIf her partner was what he's supposed to be, he'd find this mildly charming. This is a tiny feature of OP, something that hardly even rises to the level of \"quirk\", because frankly it's almost not worthy of comment except that for some reason he's taken exception to it, and wants to break her of this habit.\n\nAnd that's disturbing. This is something that affects him in not the slightest regard. It is something that makes OP happy. But because the silicon chip inside his head for some reason overloads, she has to not do this anymore.\n\nOP, review your past interactions with your BF. Does he do this in other areas?

She has been vocal about how her way of reading books (and her way of living life, as this issue is constant according to her, and he keeps pushing for her to spend/buy things and upgrades she doesn't want) isn't \"depriving\" herself. This is simply her preference and she is HAPPY this way. \n\nSo no, the guy isn't projecting FOMO on her (and that would make him an asshole too, by the way). He is very much controlling her, imposing HIS way of enjoying a book onto her by disguising it as a gift after he tried to get her to buy it and she REFUSED. \n\nIt's not about \"oh well it's just a book and you can still wait and read it in May if you wish\". It's about OP being tired of having her boundaries stomped on and having a partner who constantly tries to correct her behavior to match his.", ">He and his family like to have top of the line technology and I believe he grew up that way,\n\nThat would do it. \n\nYeah, it sounds like he just needs to learn that not everyone has the same needs/wants."]}
