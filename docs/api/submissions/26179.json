We did everything together until i moved away for college and now to Germany. \n\n9 months ago she invited me to her wedding as her bridesman. I was so happy and honored but i had to decline the invitation as I couldn\u2019t be certain i could attend. I can get the time off but not the money. She was a bit sad but still wanted me there, so she offered to stream her wedding for me. I appreciate it but i told her to wait on it for a bit.\n\nWell, few months pass by, i got the time off and a big promotion that i was aiming for. I got the ticket and flew over back to the US. I lied to Sam and told her i was coming but I would arrive the same day but after her wedding.\n\nI arrived at her wedding and I forgot my invitation at my hotel room 30 minutes away and there was security. Long story for why, tldr her mother is not welcome. So i called the maid of honor, our mutual friend Eva, and she clears me out.\n\nI enter the venue with her and guides me towards the bridal suite. Sam looked beautiful and the moment she laid eyes on me they sparkle. Then the classical insult to me for lying. It was all fun and games until this and this is where i may be the AH. She told me to walked her down the aisle.\n\nI can\u2019t lie i was honored and basically crying of happiness. Her father passed away 4 years ago, her grandfather passed away 2 years ago. Because of that she chose to walk it by her own. Her future husband\u2019s family didn\u2019t like that and offered some candidates but she refuse any. And to top it all of, his family hates me with a passion and him specially.\n\nCeremony starts and i walked her down the aisle. Her family is surprised and happy to see me but his family and him are not. The moment I let go of Sam at the altar he insults me for being the one to walk her down the aisle and that\u2019s where everything snapped. Maybe it was the stress but Sam flat out screamed at him that the wedding was off and left angry.\n\n\nAdditional info:\n\nWhy does he hates me?\nHe has never like how close Sam and I are. We just text daily, random stuff most of the time, and we have a weekly call. And that i am her ex, we dated back in the 10th grade for a year and half. We cut it off because we weren\u2019t really a couple. It was just bff with a different title.\n\n\u201cWhy does his family hates me?\nI am not a religious guy, they are. Every time i had the chance to meet them they would bring religion so i always kept my mouth shut and walked away. They think it is disrespectful and after getting to know a bit of our story they call me a home wrecker. Even though I haven\u2019t been in the states more than 6 times in the past 4 years.\n\nWhat happened after?\nWell, I followed behind Sam as his family called me all sorts of name. Eva and I calmed her down at the bridal room before going out to her favorite restaurant to cool off\n\nWhy did Sam reacted like that?\nWell, she hasn\u2019t told me anything outside of \u201cwe had been going through a rough patch and this just pushed me over\u201d i guess he or his family are a bit controlling. I know is a big allegation but the entire venue was decorated with things that aren\u2019t to her taste. All of what she told me she wanted at her wedding wasn\u2019t there.", "created_utc": 1693827235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169pmtl/aita_for_ruining_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you did provoke him, insult him, shove him or whatever, then in those actions you probably made what was an already awful experience so much worse and you would be TA.\n\nGo find your friend and give her a hug.

Feel like that information is needed for a clear and valid answer.\n\nEdit: I read your response under another comment about why he doesn\u2019t like you. You\u2019re NTA. If you being her BFF and her wanting you at the wedding causes him that much anger and discomfort, they shouldn\u2019t have gotten married because clearly she chooses to keep you in her life.", "Infos - how did you respond to this? What happened after? Why do they hate you so much?\nFeels like a lot is missing here", "NTA you didn't know the groom would have this reaction and you were doing what your friend had asked you to do.

I think she is better off with someone who respects her friendships and wishes.", "NTA, it sounds like you just happened to be the catalyst for something that was going to happen anyways. Maybe not at that exact moment but groom did this to himself by being rude and disrespectful to you and bride saw it as it was. And the family is a non-issue, you were there for your friend, who cares if they don\u2019t like the relationship? It doesn\u2019t sound like they were going to last anyways so you probably saved them a divorce lol.", "NTA\n\nI admit I read the entire story waiting for the part where you did something in some way to make yourself TA but there was nothing you did here.\n\nYou've helped your friend dodge a bullet.  I'd say her partner and his family hide a lot more than that around her to get her to walk down the aisle.  It probably only came out because they were not expecting it.", "NTA - but I'd say the bride and groom both are.\n\nThe Groom for his reaction, he could have sucked it up in the moment and explained why he wasn't happy later.\n\nThe bride because it's both their wedding, not just hers to make decisions without the grooms input, it's his day too.\n\nAlso sounds like there's more to the story if the entire grooms family doesn't like you. Is there romantic history between you two? Maybe you've been the cause of arguments across their entire relationship?", "This is a very odd situation. Here\u2019s the thing: Everyone sees her being walked down the aisle at her wedding by her ex, who she texts every day. Do you see how bad this looks? It looks bad. I am not surprised one bit that people were mad. ESH.", "NTA but so much of this story doesn't add up so I wonder if there's more to it that would give context", "NTA, if she doesn't have a problem then what's his deal. Well be glad that she stood up for you like that, one hell of a friend.", "NTA. You didn't ruin her wedding. Sam did. Maybe you just helped her dodge a bullet.", "NTA.  You didn't ruin her wedding, her fianc\u00e9 and his family did.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't ruin her wedding, she was happy to see you. She wanted you to talk her down the aisle. Her asshole fiance ruined the wedding", "NTA \n\nher ex fianc\u00e9 and his family ruined it.\n\nYou did nothing wrong, you walked your BF down the Aisle as she wanted.", "NTA. There's so much layered in here that it will never be sorted out. She's lucky to have not gotten married to this AH and his AH family.", "I'm sorry but if your friendship could ruin her wedding it isn't a you problem or even a her problem, it's a him problem. You saved your friend tbh.\n\nNTA", "ngl. i assumed this is how it went down from the beginning. but oh boy did your bff dodge a bullet right before the worst decision of her life. NTA", "NTA sounds like her fianc\u00e9 and his family are the AHs. You never know how things would work out but it sounds like she dodged a bullet.", "NTA at all. The groom was. 99.99% of grooms, who were in his exact shoes, ready to say \"I do\" but taken off guard that you are \"giving her away\" would smile and shut up for the moment. It would of came later. Maybe once they are drunk or maybe after the honeymoon. But he and his family sound crazy. Most women dream of a true friendship, with a man or woman, that lasts all the way from age 5. \"Dating\" when in high school doesn't count in my eyes. Y'all just thought being best friends meant the same as a future husband/wife. He needs to grow up. \n      Maybe you shouldn't of surprised her on her day, unless that's a normal thing Y'all do to one another. Maybe she told the groom you weren't coming and was happy and was caught off guard. I would just support your BFF anyway she needs right now. But don't come between them of they want to make it work. Maybe, just maybe, if she wants to talk with him, you can have your own convo with him and try and hash some things out.
