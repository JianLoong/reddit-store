Which would indicate that the toilet is separated from the tub, probably with its own privacy door. The tub, is also most likely recessed into a wall, maybe 10 steps or so into the room, probably with a sink or walk in closet separating it from the main entry.\n\nGiven this assumption there's two possible outcomes I see:\n\n1: the fiance was already ending the conversation with her son when OP entered the room, and he just caught the action of hanging up. In which, he's kinda the asshole for instantly sexualizing the situation. \n\n2: it wasn't her son on the phone. he startled her, she immediately panicked and ended the conversation to not get caught, and told him it was her son...

You don't have to show any part of your body unless you want to.", "I disagree. And I think it\u2019s weird of you to sexualize it. For either parent, with either gender child.", "Oh, 100%. Then it would be super gross. For this it's all this crap about her giving birth to her kid or whatever. Weird.", "Yeah if it was her son on the phone she could have told him she had to hang up because her fiance had to use the bathroom or something and said bye or whatever but just straight up hanging up on your son when he walked in is just strange", "Agreed, I wonder if he recognized the son on the phone or if she told him that's who it was, because it's very suspicious to me.", "That's just a difference of cultures. Idk where OP and his fianc\u00e9e are from, but if it's America then naturally European culture doesn't apply, and vice versa. Also, to me specifically a nude sauna isn't weird because it's such a public thing, which is very different from a video call in the bath.", "Idk if that really relates, because like, would you stand inside the bathroom with them to have that convo or would you leave and talk through the door? Personally I would find it odd to make eye contact with someone using the bathroom and have a whole conversation. To me the video call is like poking your head in to chat with someone who's naked when you could easily have just done a regular audio call and it wouldn't be weird, like talking through the door. (Idk if that makes sense or not, but that's the best way I can explain myself at 1 am)", "I mean, I have seen my mother naked numerous times, whatever. But if she video called me while in the tub I would just be like \"What the hell are you doing?\" thats so weird", "yeah really if you're gonna be naked why turn on video??", "If you see your mothers shoulders do you assume she\u2019s naked? I don\u2019t, she wears sundresses like many women do. That\u2019s the only angle this kid was getting and it\u2019s absolutely not weird. It could have been a health update on uncle chuck for all we know and it couldn\u2019t wait, we don\u2019t know.", "Have you never FaceTimed someone before?", "[deleted]", "That's a bit rude", "It\u2019s funny to me because in my house, everyone was always covered, like, completely. Def a pants house. Mom never even had a hint of cleavage, dad wouldn\u2019t walk around without a shirt unless going swimming. No crop tops or shirtless kids, no sports bra type active wear. That was just idk personal preferences. And yet, there\u2019s nothing at all weird about this to me, and it seems perfectly fine. Why make it weird OP? What are you implying and why? If either parent called me from the tub I\u2019d think nothing of it, what do I care? It\u2019s just a bath. They have time. OP is the one with the issue.", "I was/am very much pants. With a video chat, you just see a face. It\u2019s totally irrelevant.", "My mom has talked to me while using the restroom. Not a video call, but still it happens.", "By his face? Do you know how it works?", "You've never had a full blown conversation with your parent while they're in the bathroom? I'm guessing your parents also got up and got fully dressed every morning and stayed fully dressed all day and night? Lots of us didn't have that, we had a pantless mom or even naked parent and it was completely normal", "Honestly, I was raised by hippies. Nudity is nudity.\nI was taught not to sexualize people just based on nudity. And I don't. My kids don't.\n\nIt's weird to you because you likely weren't raised with that. A body is a body.", "Boundaries yall, boundaries. I\u2019m with y\u2019all, this is weird af to me. If my mom called me in the tub I\u2019d be weirded out, and im pretty sure most people would be. I\u2019d hang up and tell her not to do that. Reddit hot takes are so \u201cwtf\u201d sometimes. \n\nAlso if my wife ever calls one of our kids while she\u2019s naked and she has the video on, I\u2019d be like \u201cwtf, please just no\u201d and if I did it, especially with my daughter on the line my wife would be shocked and appalled, and that\u2019d be normal. \n\nThis is not socially normal behavior. At least not in the USA, I won\u2019t speak for others. Boundaries are our friends. \n\nThe thing people are missing is they are jumping straight to incestous assumption. It doesn\u2019t have to be that to be weird af. It\u2019s really common courtesy to your family member to not talk to them on video while you are naked. They don\u2019t want to picture you naked, they don\u2019t want the phone to slip from your hand\u2026 it\u2019s weird, and it doesn\u2019t need to happen.", "Its weird to just immediately hang up on him out if nowhere", "He\u2019s not the asshole for finding it unsettling. He\u2019s the asshole for telling her it made HIM uncomfortable like she\u2019s supposed to give a shit about his opinion. If that\u2019s a hill either of them want to die on, then they\u2019re not compatible. He can\u2019t tell a grown woman what to do regardless of how weird it is.", "She was only showing her face though?", "If it were weird the kid would say, \"mom call me back when you're out of the bath.\"", "Hey when you gotta go, you gotta go. Thank god it wasn\u2019t a blow up the toilet kind \ud83d\ude02", "\ud83d\udcaf", "Ya, he said some questionable stuff for sure. It's weird.  But he made it worse.  I'm flipping to YTA. Haha", "You definitely said words", "r/coldbuttrue\n\nnot a sub but should be", "\ud83e\udd23", "\ud83d\ude02", "And who takes a full bath in just water anyway? I'd bet there was foam and the water wasn't clear.", "Oh, for sure, but OP it apparently being crazy about it so let's consider the worst case scenario and how that's still *completely fucking fine*.\n\nThere's some kind of deep sickness in society when people can't comprehend the idea of seeing the human body *even within families*.", "I think they were being sarcastic \ud83e\udd23", "[removed]", "I hang my head in shame, I did gloss over that detail.\n\nI still don't know if it warrants \"ending the relationship\" - Though, like you, I would've hung up too in that scenario, and would never put my wife in that situation by coming and using the toilet while she's bathing (though I am fortunate enough to have multiple bathrooms)", "Yes.", "Because she's naked in the bathroom. It's worse than a work call without pants", "OP wouldn't have called it a video chat if she didn't have the camera on. Plus she said she was only showing her head", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 this tells a lot. I'm with your mom on that lol", "Lmao!!", "Of course not but I would assume you would say goodbye first or something. Could be poor phrasing on OPs part but seems like a cold hang up from the fiance", "Yah if someone just randomly hung up on me I\u2019d be confused. A simple \u2018oh I\u2019ll call you back\u2019 or \u2018sorry have to go\u2019 is more appropriate than just hanging up. I\u2019m not saying anything is happening , just the way it\u2019s been worded by OP comes across as a bit sus.", "It doesn\u2019t even matter! Video chat you just a big ole face. Everyone I talk to in this could be naked, no idea because it\u2019s just a face.", "so she was wearing a sundress in the bath?", "First line of the paragraph it says he went to use the bathroom.\n\n\n>I (47m) went in to use the bathroom earlier this evening and as I walked past the tub, saw my fiancee (51f) bathing while also video chatting with her son.", "It's the video factor that makes it weird to me", "There isn\u2019t nudity though. Have you ever video chatted with a person?", ">This is not socially normal behavior. At least not in the USA, I won\u2019t speak for others. Boundaries are our friends. \n\nYou're speaking for others. Plenty of people in the u.s. don't agree with you. My family wouldn't have any issue with this. \n\nYta op", "Your boundaries around this aren't universal, and don't have to be. And I'm sure you've been shirtless around your children without any effort to cover up.", "Here\u2019s a freedom idea: what if they were more naked around the house when growing up? \u201cSocially normal behaviour\u201d is so relative. Social norms within families differ so much.", "I agree with you, it can be weird as hell without having the sexual element. Personally, having my mom constantly nude as a kid fucked me up, but your mileage may vary.", "He came in to use the toilet...hanging up the call is not out of nowhere, js", "If you don't think people engaged in a relationship should care about each other's opinion, I honestly don't know what to say. I don't think he was demanding she do anything he was just stating he was uncomfortable, which I think most people who are well adjusted would also agree is reasonable.", "Actually, your partners opinions on who you decide to show your body to should matter. I pity your partner", "I upvoted you by the way, above. AITA has no shortage of salt.", "I\u2019m an epsom salt girl myself", "Many women get UTIs from bath products and choose to bathe in just water", ">And who takes a full bath in just water anyway?\n\nMost people who take baths?", "Lol, ok, my bad. Don't ask me how I managed not to read half of the whole comment, *sigh. I really should go to bed.", "[removed]", "Yknow how many people you\u2019ve called that easily could\u2019ve been actively naked or even shitting while on the phone??

I gotta go. I\u2019ll call you back in a few.\u201d \n\nEnding a call isn\u2019t the same as hanging up on someone. And even if she did, he walked in to poo\u2026it\u2019s justified lol", "Do you bathe wearing clothes? I was saying you\u2019d only be able to see the same amount as if she was in a sundress.
