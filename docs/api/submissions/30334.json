Which would indicate that the toilet is separated from the tub, probably with its own privacy door. The tub, is also most likely recessed into a wall, maybe 10 steps or so into the room, probably with a sink or walk in closet separating it from the main entry.\n\nGiven this assumption there's two possible outcomes I see:\n\n1: the fiance was already ending the conversation with her son when OP entered the room, and he just caught the action of hanging up. In which, he's kinda the asshole for instantly sexualizing the situation. \n\n2: it wasn't her son on the phone. he startled her, she immediately panicked and ended the conversation to not get caught, and told him it was her son... In which his suspicions are warranted. & I'd say he's not the asshole.\n\n\n\n\nBut not knowing anything about their relationship, the woman, or the dynamic/relationship she shares with her son: it's hard to say which is accurate.\n\n\nEither way, homies got a deep bathroom. \ud83e\udd23", "YTA, you sound jealous and almost accusatory, which suggests you think little of your gf.

It would be weird if it was angled down, but it wasn't. It's sometimes nice to catch up with someone face to face.", "It's the nudity freaking people out, not the video chatting.\nThe fact that she's bathing. Which is generally a nude activity.", "Yeah but a lot of people seem to either think mom is holding the phone in such a way as it's showing her breasts or they're upset by the mere thought that she is naked while talking with her son, even if he can't see anything. Personally, I was raised in one of those \"nudity doesn't equal sex\" families and while I can respect that not everyone is as comfortable about it as I am, I  have a problem with the judgemental people who seem to think that if you've ever seen a family member naked or been naked around a family member that means you're a depraved pervert.", "I would also hang up if I was about to subject someone to someone else's urine waterfall. It wouldn't matter if it was my doctor, son, or an adulterous affair.", "She showed her *face* to her *son*. She\u2019s not doing OnlyFans", "Seriously. And have these people, like, never been to a gym? Do they shower/change in the locker room? There's usually at least one person wandering around naked.\n\nAnd that's in the women's, I hear it's often much more of a thing in the men's.", "And I'm an Epsom salt crone!", "Me too", "Me too, Epsom salts with lavender. So relaxing, I want a bath now.", "Yeah I'm in it for the relaxing hot water, not foam that will make my tub slippery and be annoying to clean.", "Sarah Milican does a bit about Lush bath bombs and I\u2019m sure she says something like how she can feel her lady parts recoil as she walks past one just in case", "Oh wow I never knew that. Makes sense though", "Poo does not smell good and is not a fleeting smell.  Fan and spray, 30 minutes later I still smell poo.  Gross", "I guess people are offended by toilet rooms.\n\nPlus, its nice not having the toilet in the same room as my towel, toothbrush, soaps, etc.", "Because I replied to a comment\u2026. No the OP", "If you\u2019re just seeing him shirtless (like the video call) what\u2019s the big deal? Yea I\u2019d never go hang out with my dad in the bathroom while he\u2019s naked, but if he called me from the tub and all I could see was his face, I wouldn\u2019t care.", "Yeah I get it. I also hate video calls. But I think a part of it for me is because I can see myself XD I don't have any big body issues, but I don't like perceiving how I interact with others. I also find (as someone who is autistic) the main way I read people is tone of voice, I don't get body language very much. So I don't feel like I'm missing much in phone calls.\n\nBut yeah, like you I still video call people if it's someone important to me.", "Did you know that every time someone sees me wearing clothes that I am naked underneath?", "If you like Epson salts and lavender, I highly recommend trying the brand called \"this works\" they have a product called deep sleep with lavender and vetiver in it and it is heavenly.", "Yep and for people who take baths regularly it's so much more work with set up and cleaning", "Foam is nice but I\u2019m not regularly spending money on special bubble bath or using my actual body soap for that\u2014I take too many baths!", "bath salts are far superior to slippery foam!", "The bubbles keep\nThe water warmer longer", "She\u2019s awesome!", "If it smells 30 minutes later you need a better extractor fan and a better diet. That's not normal or healthy.", "My dude, change your diet ahahahhahaha", "It would appear we have pissed people off with the simple idea part of the world has come accustomed too. You\u2019re right I grew up in a 1 bath house with 7 of us, it was hell using the bathroom to brush your teeth when someone just had their morning dump", "His was in context of her doing things that don't effect you bud. And then you went on to literally say ohh yeah what if she becomes a heroin addict and starts killing people I have to be okay with that?!\n\nLike no dude, no shit you can set healthy boundaries.", "I saw her live a couple of weeks ago. I was crying with laughter"]}
