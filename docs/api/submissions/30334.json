Which would indicate that the toilet is separated from the tub, probably with its own privacy door. The tub, is also most likely recessed into a wall, maybe 10 steps or so into the room, probably with a sink or walk in closet separating it from the main entry.\n\nGiven this assumption there's two possible outcomes I see:\n\n1: the fiance was already ending the conversation with her son when OP entered the room, and he just caught the action of hanging up. In which, he's kinda the asshole for instantly sexualizing the situation. \n\n2: it wasn't her son on the phone. he startled her, she immediately panicked and ended the conversation to not get caught, and told him it was her son...

That. Is. Weird. The average teenager would already normally find this traumatic enough (and I\u2019m not going to apologize for saying that if you claim the opposite, you probably weren\u2019t a normal teenager) but a grown man finding it totally okay to FaceTime his bathing mother is 100% bizarre, and just because that might be normal for some cultures does not make it normal for others. Hell, there\u2019s the realistic expectation that it\u2019s probably a contentious topic in the cultures where it\u2019s \u201cnormalized.\u201d If someone FaceTimed me from the toilet or the tub, I\u2019d have found it really rude and highly inappropriate, regardless of my relationship to them.\n\nLike, unless they fight often and OP gaslights her constantly (which we couldn\u2019t infer from the barely paragraph he\u2019s given, much like you shouldn\u2019t infer the weird sexual/incest shit people have nailed onto him) then 1) she could have just kept the conversation going, turning it away from a potential view of her SO, 2) she wouldn\u2019t have immediately gotten off the phone as it sounds like she\u2019s been caught if she didn\u2019t ALSO think it was weird, and 3) she could have just given a regular old phone call rather than FaceTime. Checking in on somebody doesn\u2019t require a video call, idk what\u2019s happened to people lately seemingly thinking that\u2019s the ONLY way we as a species can communicate without being in the same room. Hell, a simple text message is probably most appropriate here, since you can just text and finish your bath.\n\nThis is the behavior of somebody who is cheating on you, not somebody who REALLY needs to check on their grown son at the exact point in time most human beings would prefer to NOT be seen.

I believe I saw one that was along the lines of \u201cwhy would you sexualize your conversation with your daughter or think about her that way\u201d or some such along those lines and it\u2019s like\u2026 but you brought that to this conversation in the first place??? Like, it\u2019s not even remotely questionable to imply that a naked man calling his daughter to check in on her wouldn\u2019t be under heavier scrutiny than the reverse scenario.

Hopefully, with the increase in education and resources, we can all do better moving forward.", "Why are you acting like you know what happened? All we have to go by is what OP said and it could be interpreted in many ways.", "My mom and I took showers together when we went camping because of extremely limited hot water and my ridiculously thick long hair. If it wasn\u2019t for her acrylics getting through all the hair to my scalp without matting my hair to the scalp when we ran out of conditioner, I\u2019d have had to shave it all off. We shared clothes too. She\u2019d walk into my walk-in closet while we were both wrapped in towels with two shirts asking which one looked better and I\u2019d pull something out of my flowy clothes and ask if she liked it better than either of her options and if she did, she wore it and then sometimes I\u2019d raid her closet for a massively oversized sweater that I could wear as a dress with cute boots and off the shoulder or a cardigan I liked but thought it would be stupid to buy duplicates of things when we regularly closet swapped. Sometimes she wore my emo/scene/punk aesthetic down to the jewelry and combat boots and sometimes I wore her cottage core/kitchen witch/dark academia aesthetic. She\u2019d wake me up early as shit on a Saturday morning after we had stayed up almost all night being cryptid gremlins with insomnia telling me we were going shopping and having a girls day and if I hadn\u2019t moved in 10 minutes she was gonna rip the blankets off me, then had a pot of coffee brewed so I could make our favorite batshit coffee to drink while we got ready. She always insisted on me doing her makeup because, \u201cyou do it like your grandmother used to paint landscapes. With focus and care. Like every time is a work of art and deserves your full attention to become a masterpiece. You make me look and feel like I\u2019m in my 30s again.\u201d And I never complained because I liked doing it and it always made her so happy. She also loved watching me do my own makeup because I was far more adventurous than she was and was always trying new and sometimes wild things.", "There\u2019s plenty of puritanical cultures.", "Over the Summer I shut the bathroom door one time to try to get away from the kids because I had a migraine and I was close to losing it. As soon as I sat down and dropped my head into my hands, a kid came running in with tears streaming down her face, \u201cSISTER CALLED ME GARFIELD!\u201d I glanced up and just said, \u201cget out.\u201d She immediately stopped the fake tears and walked out. I text my husband while he was a work and he thought it was so hilarious that he had to go share it with his office neighbor.", "I didn\u2019t close the bathroom door for 23 years.  When I could, I was taking care of my mother with dementia, and she walked in, no knock or announcement.  Then the grandkids lived with me for a time (ages newborn til 7). \n\nNow I live alone except for my seizure service dog. Still can\u2019t close the door, he\u2019ll just paw the lever and open the door, he literally has a whiny hissy fit if he can\u2019t be next to me. \n\nOP needs serious Psychiatric treatment for his condition. Dude, you\u2019re more uptight than a Victorian Era Debutante.", "If you get a cat, you will never pee alone again.", "I have a deal with the dog: only when I pee. For poop I need my peace. He has accepted this and will leave the bathroom when I don't pet him. Unfortunately he doesn't know how to close the door after himself.", "Agree. Before my kids came along, my two cats would reach their arms under the door and yell at me. It was easy to ignore them until they discovered they could pull up the carpet with their claws at the doorway.", "It\u2019s like Mom\u2019s butts send out a call only their children can hear regardless of how far away they are.", ">How the hell.....\n\nI mean it objectively does happen. \nIt's rare, but usually hide and seek among teens, drunks and kids. Or repairing some smaller models and grtting trapped by the drum in one way or another. \n\n\nOr in the case of a tumble dryer occasionally shit will get sucked thrown into weird places and tio actually reach you need to put a decent bit of your body into it, unfortunately it's much easier to get into anyrhing than get out", "Only one way to find out for sure!", "Honestly I think it\u2019s weirder that he\u2019s using the toilet while she\u2019s taking a bath than the idea of her essentially talking on the phone", "In the men's you'll see naked old men with one leg hiked up on the sink, shaving their face. Why? I presume to pass down the random old man hairy butthole trauma they had to endure.", "Oh you absolutely can't avoid seeing balls.\nAlthough in the (cheap-ish) gym I've been to,  there was only a shared shower room, this might have added up. \n\nI mean you could wear swimming shorts or whatever, but you'll be the one who sticks out.", "My little nephew is like that LOL\n\nQuietly watching cartoons one minute, but the minute I need to go to the bathroom he suddenly needs some sort of attention hahaha once I asked \"Benjamin, auntie really needs to poop in peace, do you really need me right now?\" and he goes \"okay, so I'll just wait in here\" and proceeded to wait by the closed door until I was finished. Turns out he just really loves my company, that kid.", "We had a couple of cats (who have both sadly passed) who would almost invariably accompany me to the bathroom every time. Oddly, they weren't related, they just both had that personality.\n\nNow one of my cats will sometimes come use the litter box while I'm on the toilet, while staring at me. She's sweet but strange.", "ROFL, and my 4yo daughter told me \u201cthat was a loud one mommy! DO IT AGAIN\u201d \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "They get upto all kind of hijinks mate. I met a few recently, and they were on the chewing tobacco type stuff (you dont chew it but put it in your mouth). They gave me some and it was foul. Then they caused a cultural shift in England during the Medievel period after we had a few drinks. It's not just the nakedness. Watch out.", "My parents had 3 kids in a house with 1 bathroom. It was very common to use the toilet when some one was in the bath tub.", "It was pee not poop", "It's not exactly romantic \ud83d\ude02", "My sister had me hop in a hot shower 3 days postpartum and messaged my boobs to get my milk to come in. \n\nSingle mom at the time, and my boobs hurt so freaking bad I couldn\u2019t cross my arms. \nNo amount of pumping was doing the trick and my girls were in the nicu. \n\nI\u2019ll forever be thankful", "Leg on the sink. To *shave*.\n\n... Maybe they're secretly dreaming of shaving their legs but just can't commit", "Me too, tea just about out my nostrils! I wonder if she's on reddit to see this!", "My oldest decided to hop in the (Thankfully dry) bathtub and just STARE AT ME till I finished. Dude. Seriously. Wtf. \ud83d\ude02", "Oh, I'm allowed to fart, unless he's the one closest to me \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\n\nLike... Child. CHILD. I am in MY bathroom with is only accessible through MY room. I can fart if I want.", "I raised three boys, why did I never think of this!", "Those are called snus, I think.", "I remember when my elderly aunt was in rehab after breaking her hip and needed help getting off the toilet and wiping and she kept apologizing to me for needing the help and I reminded her that she changed my diapers and wiped me plenty of times as a kid and I\u2019d literally do anything for her. We take care of people we love and if roles were reversed I\u2019m sure your grandfather would\u2019ve done the same for you. That\u2019s what unconditional love is and bless you for providing that kind of help and care for him. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "Anyone who has had to wipe their aging parent or grandparent gets over that craziness real fast. When it's a choice between cleaning up your parent or letting them sit in their own diarrhea, you put on a pair of gloves and get to work.", "He was the best grandpa you can imagine. He's been gone nearly 20 years now and I still think of him all the time. Like, when I think of the concept of \"positive masculinity\" in opposition to \"toxic masculinity,\" that was this man. Raising babies and grandbabies, building houses for his family, working from dusk til dawn, darning socks and mittens, patching clothes, doing dishes, and taking in his mother, in-laws, brother, niece, and grand-nephew as needed. A huge animal lover who helped every dog, cat, and horse he saw in need.", "Genuine question, do you shower off with soap after, or do you just soak in the water and be done with it?"]}
