So one day when my brother was wrapping up a visit home from college, I called out 'wait!' because I had something to say. Everyone gathered around wondering what sisterly wisdom I had. I said, 'Remember, don't vote for Obama because it's a sin', and everyone but my mom busted out laughing. She got really angry and ran off. We never spoke about it again. I never apologized, either, because I was just quoting her.\n\nEDIT: I voted using an absentee ballot, hence mom's very illegal, non-actionable plot. also i was the AH in this, i freely admit. I don't think OP is for accidentally laughing and then explaining himself when confronted", "NTA I\u2019d have laughed a lot more obnoxiously but I\u2019m petty.

Does he have any contact with his dad\u2019s family?", "NTA you're a good sister.", "NTA. What she said was a joke and if it wasn't your dad married a lunatic.

They then demanded that you explain yourself, and you did. You didn't intervene, you reacted then responded to their demands. \n\nP.S. Good job being a supportive step-sibling. That kid lost his father and is just trying to reconnect with him in the only ways he can. Your stepmother literally demonizing both the father and the kid's current actions is extremely harmful and he can use all of the support he can get when the adults in his life are being assholes.", "But what a horrible thing to say to your step brother.

Your SM may say she believes in god, but she isn't acting like it and neither is your dad.\n\nI think you were awesome sort of sticking up for your SB.\n\nYou are NTA and frankly a rock star!", "Make them watch The Waterboy.  It's an Adam Sandler movie, and his mom (played by Cathy Bates) keeps saying everything is the devil.  It's pretty funny.", "You are the most clear NTA case I have ever read on reddit. Good on you for supporting him, you are an awesome brother, it's so clear from the way you talk about him. \u2764", "It is history's greatest ponzi/MLM scheme after all", "Love your answer but many won\u2019t understand the reference.", "Also, (ask if he's cool with it first) start calling your step bro my dark lord or the antichrist lmao", "Extremely religious people come up with the most ridiculous things.  Regardless if they 'believe' or not, they are using religion to manipulate someone else.   disgusting.", "Or comfort him that he is going to marry a woman like Charlize Theron \ud83d\ude1c", "I like your style.", "After the morning I just had with my spawn, I am now COMPLETELY entertaining myself with the idea of changing my name to Rosemary.", "She absolutely did!", "NTA. A well -crafted apology will be sincere in communicating that you are sorry feelings were hurt, it was not your intention to do so. Do ***NOT***, however, apologize for your opinions.  I'm a firm believer, and I find your step-family's views about \"the devil\" ridiculous!", "NTA.  You didn't intervene.  Your father and step-mother had already put you in the middle when they discussed it with you previously.  You laughed because, let's be honest, it's funny.  Your dad wanted to know why and you gave him your honest thoughts...which were also funny, btw.  It's obvious they take themselves and religion far too seriously.  I think it's nice that you defended your step-brother.  I don't think you should have to apologize, but that's just me.", "NTA. it would have been 10 times funnier if you just laughed so hard you puked", "Hypocrites always have problems when having a mirror placed before them.  Might say\u2026\n\n\u201cSorry Stepmom, I had an inadvertent physical reaction to the hypocritical situation being bandied about and couldn\u2019t stifle it.  Please accept my apologies for inadvertently making you feel bad\u201d.\n\nNot that I think you really need to apologize.  NTA", "Hi! I\u2019m a Christian! A very devout Christian, I believe! They\u2019re dumb! NTA", "NTA but you sure are funny! \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. When I was young tween teenager my sister (4 years older than me) and I listened to KISS. My foreign, religious zealot mother assumed they were devil worshippers because of their makeup. We let her think that. All of their songs are about sex which to a religious zealot is MUCH worse than devil worship. I think what you did was fine. You\u2019re a good person and really good step sister. Your brother is lucky to have you. Since no one else in the house has his back. Personally I would become violent if I heard something negative about my dead dad.", "I love that the grandparents lost their shit over hockey. I would almost assume OP is Canadian for them to equate quitting hockey to keeping company with the devil.", "Oh, the hypocrisy \ud83d\ude02 You are NTA. Your response was golden and your stepbrother is lucky to have you on his side. If I was your mother, I\u2019d have given you a high five because I can appreciate someone serving up a nice dish of sarcasm.", "NTA. Devil child?  All the adults here sound very strange. Why is he a devil child because he got his ears pierced and grew his hair and wants to resemble his dad?? That they would ground you for laughing at something ridiculous is disturbing. They all sound like bible thumping weirdo\u2019s honestly. You\u2019re 17 and when your 18 you may want to bolt from the religious crowd. Also 17 is still a minor but they grounded you for that? Wow. Strange.", "Nta", "NTA you're a kick ass step sister.", "You should\u2019ve called your stepbro Damien. At least you know what movie to watch with him tonight.", "Sometimes I wonder if religious people should be treated for mental illness like they used to treat LGBTQIA+ people...", "\ud83d\ude06", "Like literally worshiping a corpse nailed to a piece of wood.", "He should talk to Ethan and have an inside joke of calling Ethan's mom, Mama mia.\n\nShe'll think it's sweet, but it'll be a rosemary's baby joke", "I was about to upvote that.", "Lol I was just thinking that. Not sure if OP will understand the reference.", "I did that once. I worked in car insurance. A well know but shady attorney was on maternity leave. I asked another attorney in her office, \u201cso how is Rosemary\u2019s baby?\u201d I think she was mad. I\u2019m much younger than her and it was a long time ago so I had to be in my mid 20s", "DID YOU FUCK MY MOM, SANTA?!", "Nta cause that's a natural way to react to the ridiculousness\n\nBut also a good idea to apologise. I agree with your mother here", "Definitely NTA.  Maybe see if your brother is okay with you using Lucifer as a nickname for him, just to really piss your family off? But probably don't do that.  I give terrible advice.  I'm sorry for what your brother is going through thanks to your family but I'm sure that he really appreciates that you have his back.", "NTA. I laughed too. And I absolutely love your response, because by their logical there, you\u2019re 100% correct", "NTA, but you should totally tell your step brother to change his name to Damien.", "NTA, but I would apologize for making an already tense situation more uncomfortable.", "You are a lot nicer than me... I would have just played along and said \"Yeah, why would you like to be like dad?\"", "NTA", "op=NTA\n\nYou were literally defending your stepbrother from accusations of being the DEVIL.\n\nYour mom just doesn't want to deal with the trouble you defending him is causing, because he's not her business.", "NTA and don\u2019t apologise until THEY apologise to Ethan.", "NTA\nBut apologise anyway. For Ethan\u2018s sake. And tell him that you have his back. \nThe apology should only be about the \u201ehaving a child with the Devil\u201c bit (though it is genius) other than that stand your ground respectfully", "You got it lol.", "Good for you sticking up for Ethan. Absolutely NTA.", "I feel sorry for Ethan...  nothing at all wrong with him wanting to connect with his deceased father.  I think it's pretty cool, and it sounds like you're in his corner.\n\nParents need to STFU with this religious bullshit...it's doing nothing but hurting Ethan.  Also wondering why wicked stepmom would call her deceased husband Satan?  That's just weird.  Did she not grieve when he passed away?", "Are you sure? Saying this about the dead father of her son sounds pure evil. I can't even imagine how he must have felt. Are you sure they are not gliding down the slippery slope of extremist Christianity?", "I have lots of extended family in Kitchener so my ears are finely tuned to overrepresentation of hockey and various professional wrestling dynasties at holiday events. \u2764\ufe0f", "They still believe in scapegoating other human sacrifices to appease god for *your* own sins. Jesus is just the ultimate virgin in a volcano sacrifice. \n\nAnd these people make fun of kids for believing in Santa Claus...", "Sister!!"]}
