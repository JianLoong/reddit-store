I felt honored and excited, as this will be my first wedding to attend as well as be apart of in my life. Originally, the wedding was set for some time in 2025, which seemed reasonable because I thought that allowed everyone, especially them to save, plan, and execute a beautiful wedding. Now somewhere between that 9 months til now, they decided to call the wedding off due to them wanting to just have an intimate courthouse wedding and then have a reception instead of the whole shabang. \n\nAs of September 2023, literally last month, they decided to call the wedding back on and have the ceremony and reception and everything else that comes with it. They wedding date was set for October 24th. LESS THAN A MONTH AWAY from finding out it\u2019s back on and now they\u2019re scrambling, everyone\u2019s scrambling. I had to order a last minute dress, as did everyone else, and get my whole bridesmaid outfit put together, on top of figuring out a wedding gift for the happy couple. Now my problem is that as the day gets closer, my friend is sending out mass group texts wanting to hold a meeting about the leftover costs for the wedding and wants to delegate these costs to her friends and family. I feel like I\u2019m being railroaded. I do not think it\u2019s fair or right to asks for your friends to help pay large amounts to a wedding that they planned to be in 2025, then called off, and then called back on with only about 25 days until the big day. This is making me feel stressed as hell and I\u2019m not even the one getting married. \n\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my duty to have to sacrifice my savings and put myself in a financial bind for the sake of them. I love and care about my friend greatly, but I feel like she\u2019s being inconsiderate. Am I wrong to think that or am I overthinking this? I really would like to know as I have never been to a wedding or in a wedding for that matter. My mom told me that if it were her, she just wouldn\u2019t attend but I don\u2019t feel like I have that option as the bride is one of my best friends and I really would like to celebrate them! What are your thoughts?\n\n\nUPDATE: So, I thank you all for sharing your thoughts and opinion on the matter. I decided to text her privately and clearly and concisely let her know that I will not be able to contribute to her wedding due to me having already adjusted my finances to accommodate the new wedding date. Because I still would like to attend and celebrate this moment with her, I let her know that I am still looking forward to attending the wedding. Her response was that they weren\u2019t expecting people to be able to help (despite making a group chat and specifically stating they had leftover costs for the wedding that they would need help covering) and that she\u2019s glad I was able to adjust and make time to attend their wedding.", "created_utc": 1697387295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178j30v/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_cover_the_costs_of/", "score": 940, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did she actually use it?", "NTA.\n\nIf your wedding is a potluck reception, I will bring a salad to share. \n\nIf it\u2019s not, you can expect me with a gift or cash in a card. Of value to cover the cost of my meal, more if we\u2019re close, because I\u2019m told that\u2019s the polite amount. \n\nBut I\u2019m not going to give you money to pay for a party that you\u2019re throwing. That I have to take extra time and money to buy you a gift, myself an outfit, drive to your venue, maybe get a hotel room too. No way!", "Not your wedding, not your problem.  Your friend sounds ballsy.", "NTA you should not have to pay for your friends wedding. She is the one who changed the date last minute so it her responsibility", "Good for you for contacting her and being clear! Hope it's a lovely day for all.\nBtw no way should she be trying to get her guests to help pay for her party.", "Leftover costs?????   LOL", "NTA, no one is obligated to contribute to someone else\u2019s wedding but the groom and bride themselves! It\u2019s nice when people voluntarily contribute but I do not think it\u2019s ok to ask for money on an event YOU want to host. Needless to say, I am glad your friend was understanding about it after you addressed it.", "Absolute not. Wtf???? How entitled do you have to be to ask your friends to help pay for your wedding  Wtf. NTA", "Nta: not your fault they suck at planning", "What? You're not feeling honored anymore? \ud83e\udd23", "Yeh, solidly NTA. That's her issue to move the wedding like that, and it's her issue to pay for it all. You are under zero obligation to help fund a damn thing, other than your bridesmaid dress, even then she should be able to understand when people can't afford it all. \n\nWe changed our minds and eloped in my parents backyard (with a weeks notice to my family, but we paid for any and all expenses to have our immediate families there for that) and decided to throw a big party for our friends and extended family 3 months later. I never asked for a dime from anyone, but was willing to accept when people offered to make stuff for our \"reception\". We hired a caterer for the main meal, my mother and I did most of the appetizers, but had one friend offer to make buffalo chicken dip, another offer to make charcuterie, and another offered to help me with favors (we did chocolate covered pretzels together that we wrapped in with the utensils). \n\nI had 3 friends that I had asked to wear blue, since that was our \"wedding color\" and he had 3 friends that he had asked to wear blue shirts that day. That was our \"wedding party\" and we didn't ask a dime of them.", "NTA just say no. Your friend\u2019s request is absurd. Maybe she\u2019s hoping people will be so shocked by the audacity that they will comply.", "No, her request is way out of line. You handled it exceptionally well.", "NTA - The cost of the wedding is ALWAYS the responsibility of the bride and groom.  Their families and friends can contribute if they want, but it is NEVER the responsibility of anyone but the bride and groom.  \n\n\nIT is extremely rude of her to ask her firends to help with teh cost.", "Sounds like this friend has a tap water budget and champagne tastes, lol", "[removed]", "We know what the something else is from comments. Bride is enlisting in January so hurrying up the wedding to qualify for military married housing and other benefits. Which is a fine decision.\n\nBut unlike myriad military courthouse weddings before her, she decided she still wants the big blowout that she cannot yet afford.\n\nAs a bridesmaid, OP is required (per Miss Manners) to pay for/wear the designated dress, show up on time to the wedding and any rehearsal, and stay sober enough to make a toast without embarrassing herself.\n\nBeyond what etiquette requires, it is common for the bridesmaids to plan and throw a shower or a bachelorette (note they plan/throw it, not the bride) and give the couple a gift.\n\nAnything more is greed fueled by the unquenchable thirst of the wedding industry.\n\nThis bride has taken it to a new level. She is hurrying her wedding to get a significant financial advantage for herself, and wanting her friends and family to pay her for that decision.\n\nNTA.", "I agree. OP I don\u2019t want to be the one to say this but do you think your friend could be pregnant?

It's does make some sense", "Something about married housing, maybe?", "If married she'll get a housing allowance after training.", "The military treats married soldiers completely differently than unmarried soldiers. Being partnered but unmarried while in the military is not just playing on hard mode, it's playing on ultra hard permadeath mode.\n\nWhich is why it's extremely common for young people going into the military to get married way too early, because their options are either get married before you enlist or break up shortly after you enlist.", "The military pays married people more, gives them better housing, and moves both of their belongings. They may even make an assignment decision based on spouse\u2019s current job or enrollment in school", "BAH adds up to a *lot* of money very quickly and you don't have to live in the barracks for minimum of several years until you're an NCO of sufficient rank. All junior enlisted must live in the barracks unless they are married.", "If both were military and they don't have to live in the barracks or other enlisted quarters and if they live together but are unmarried they get two housing allowances for that rather than just a moderately larger joint allowance. There may be housing on base that they'd prefer and only be eligible for when married. At least that is how it was (US) when I was in.  If only one is in the service, they'd make more BAH married. You'd have to do the math on what is best all around.", "Ah, the Soviet system.  Get married so you still have a girl to go home to.
