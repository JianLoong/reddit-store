I felt honored and excited, as this will be my first wedding to attend as well as be apart of in my life. Originally, the wedding was set for some time in 2025, which seemed reasonable because I thought that allowed everyone, especially them to save, plan, and execute a beautiful wedding. Now somewhere between that 9 months til now, they decided to call the wedding off due to them wanting to just have an intimate courthouse wedding and then have a reception instead of the whole shabang. \n\nAs of September 2023, literally last month, they decided to call the wedding back on and have the ceremony and reception and everything else that comes with it. They wedding date was set for October 24th. LESS THAN A MONTH AWAY from finding out it\u2019s back on and now they\u2019re scrambling, everyone\u2019s scrambling. I had to order a last minute dress, as did everyone else, and get my whole bridesmaid outfit put together, on top of figuring out a wedding gift for the happy couple. Now my problem is that as the day gets closer, my friend is sending out mass group texts wanting to hold a meeting about the leftover costs for the wedding and wants to delegate these costs to her friends and family. I feel like I\u2019m being railroaded. I do not think it\u2019s fair or right to asks for your friends to help pay large amounts to a wedding that they planned to be in 2025, then called off, and then called back on with only about 25 days until the big day. This is making me feel stressed as hell and I\u2019m not even the one getting married. \n\nI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s my duty to have to sacrifice my savings and put myself in a financial bind for the sake of them. I love and care about my friend greatly, but I feel like she\u2019s being inconsiderate. Am I wrong to think that or am I overthinking this? I really would like to know as I have never been to a wedding or in a wedding for that matter. My mom told me that if it were her, she just wouldn\u2019t attend but I don\u2019t feel like I have that option as the bride is one of my best friends and I really would like to celebrate them! What are your thoughts?\n\n\nUPDATE: So, I thank you all for sharing your thoughts and opinion on the matter. I decided to text her privately and clearly and concisely let her know that I will not be able to contribute to her wedding due to me having already adjusted my finances to accommodate the new wedding date. Because I still would like to attend and celebrate this moment with her, I let her know that I am still looking forward to attending the wedding. Her response was that they weren\u2019t expecting people to be able to help (despite making a group chat and specifically stating they had leftover costs for the wedding that they would need help covering) and that she\u2019s glad I was able to adjust and make time to attend their wedding.", "created_utc": 1697387295, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178j30v/aita_for_not_wanting_to_help_cover_the_costs_of/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
