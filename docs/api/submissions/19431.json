I've repeatedly expressed my dislike for her and anyone else making such comments. I've tried to educate her on the privacy of this topic and how intrusive it is to ask (let alone demand) others to have children.\n\nI gave her the first \"warning,\" explaining that I didn't feel comfortable discussing that. Her comeback: procreation is the only purpose of human beings and as a woman I should naturally have maternal instincts.\n\nSecond warning I said I have a different opinion and asked her to respect my boundaries. She then said how happy she is with her four kids and how she has no regrets about motherhood.\n\nThird warning, less calm. I told her that I respect her decisions and would never judge her choices regarding bringing children into the world.

That\u2019s what blew me up!\n\nI know I don't owe her no explanations, especially on this topic. But I didn't pause to think before responding and told her that if she truly wanted to know why I didn't want kids, it was because of her and her threats. By this point, I was far from calm.\n\nFor some time now, she has been threatening that when I have kids, she will spoil them, scold them, cover up their wrongdoings, and more. She has argued with me about being close to my MIL, fearing that my children would prefer her over my mom. So, when I said she was the main reason I didn't want kids, it wasn't entirely untrue. \n\nShe started crying, saying that I had hurt her so bad and hung up. Later she texted calling me cruel and immature for blaming her and that I am an ungrateful daughter.\n\nNow, even when I know that I would have the option to raise kids without her around, I really don\u2019t want to go NC because I love her. I'm working on finding healthier ways to communicate with her. But even when I think I should\u2019ve address this differently, rn my biggest fear of having children is the added stress it would bring to our already fragile relationship.\n\nI feel guilty for making her cry and wonder if I should\u2019ve kept this to myself (and my therapist maybe).\n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1686381979, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/145tlp0/aita_for_telling_my_mom_i_dont_want_kids_because/", "score": 257, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
