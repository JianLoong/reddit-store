He's doing great, but had an accident.  If you're a parent and I say it was one of THOSE messes, you'll understand. As I was peeling his underwear off, there was liquid poo just Covering the backs of his legs. I'm no stranger to cleaning my son up but this was excessive. \n\nThe door to the bathroom was open. I was sitting on the tub with my son between me and the hallway. My daughter's cat Princess is a very sweet and affectionate cat.\n\nShe jogs into the bathroom and before I can yell to stop her, love bumps the back of my son's poo covered thighs. Like rubs her side against the back of the rancid and liquid poo covered legs. \n\nAs the \"OMG Princess NO!\" makes it out of my mouth, the deed is done, but now I've spooked the f-ing cat and she darts out of the bathroom. \n\nI yell for my daughter, and she comes running. I hand her some toilet paper and tell her to go find the cat and see if there's any poo on the cat.\n\nMy daughter dissapears. I started cleaning the poo from my son, but decide to just stick him in the tub so I can try to make sure the cat hadn't made a mess of things. It's been a couple minutes. \n\nHere's where I might be the AH. I come out, and see my daughter laid out on the couch munching snacks watching TV, with the clean piece of tp on the coffee table. I yell at her asking where the cat is. She gave me a \"she's right there Dad. She's fine.\" She did it with just enough attitude to be mildly annoying but not enough that would normally get her in trouble. I'm still in full panic mode. Under the coffee table, Princess the cat is sitting \"poo side\" away from my daughter. Clearly visible, however,  was that the entire shoulder and side of this cat was streaked in poo. I yelled at her for not even looking or caring that her cat was covered in crap. I then told her to turn the TV off and go watch her brother. \n\nI ran and got a towel, caught the cat, and took her to my bathroom. She got out of the towel but I had shut the bathroom. I grabbed her by the scruff of her neck and held our cat by the scruff and her belly while I showered poo off of this poor cat. I'm still not sure how I got out of that shower without being clawed. I think she wanted the poo off as much as I did.\n\nI sternly spoke to my daughter about her attitude,  told her to go to her room, and then bathed my son.\n\nI felt bad about yelling at my daughter the way I did. Im normally not a yelling person but I was super annoyed at her, and we've been working with her on her attitude. She's a great kid though, wins citizens awards at school and stuff. She was mad at me for yelling at her. \n\nAITA?\n\nSide note: my wife thought this whole ordeal was hilarious and shared it with all the other moms at the PTC thing.\n\nWhile funny, I promise this was 100% real.", "created_utc": 1692273054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15tl7df/aita_for_panic_yelling_at_my_daughter/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I however do suggest that you go to talk to your daughter now that you all have calmed down. Apologise for yelling at her, and she will learn two valuable lessons today. First one being that sometimes when daddy asks for assistance he really really needs it too, and second one being that sometimes even adults make mistakes and apologise for those.", "Oh my god wow this situation would have given me an aneurysm", "NAH provided you apologise. Sometimes we screw up and over react as parents it happens. But when that does happen we apologise.", "NTA hahaha we\u2019re all human and seems you guys have a great relationship. that could\u2019ve gone way worse and as long as you guys talked about it afterwards so she understands that a poopy cat is a nightmare situation, yal are good. you guys will laugh over this when she\u2019s older.", "NTA parents can\u2019t be perfect and kids can be frustrating. It wasn\u2019t the 8 year olds fault the cat got poop on em but yeah I get that whole thing kids do all the time that they act like they checked something and it\u2019s fine when it isn\u2019t fine, and it definitely can make someone blow up lemme tell you.", "NTA. People shout sometimes. Your daughter was being difficult while you were busy and frustrated. It happens.", "NAH. In an emergency, it\u2019s reasonable to expect an eight-year-old to make a good-faith effort to be helpful when asked. Her not successfully coping with getting the cat clean wouldn\u2019t have been surprising at all, but not even trying is unreasonable. You\u2019re not an AH for asking her to help or for communicating that you were angry that she didn\u2019t try \u2014 that\u2019s one way kids learn about expectations. (You might be the AH if you were yelling an unreasonable amount or unreasonably intensely, but we can\u2019t tell that from the story.)\n\nYour daughter behaved badly by not trying to get the cat clean, but isn\u2019t an AH because she\u2019s eight, which is at the younger end of when you can expect a kid to start behaving like a reasonably helpful competent human being when it\u2019s necessary. She doesn\u2019t get that as an obligation yet, and it\u2019s your job to teach it to her, which you should be doing explicitly before emergencies arise, as well as by expecting her to do what she can when it\u2019s needed.\n\nI would talk to her now and not apologize for yelling unless you think you were unreasonable in manner. But explain that sometimes other people, even her parents, are going to be in situations where they need help, and part of growing up into a decent person is learning how to try your best when your help is needed.", "NTA shit happens but man that gave me a laugh \ud83d\ude06", "Wait wait? Did you leave you\u2019re 2 year old alone in the tub? Please tell me it was empty. If so NAH. It\u2019s a hilarious shitty situation. If the tub was filled. Holy fuck your the a\u2026 and a very shitty parent.", "YTA. \n\nShe's 8, it's actually YOUR cat. \n\nWhy was the bathroom door left open if you had a friendly pet who might come interrupt when your son's pants are down? Even if the cat did touch your son, shutting the bathroom door to contain the cat instead of yelling at it would have made this a non-issue.\n\nEither way it does not warrant \"panic\" or yelling at your 8 year old who is ultimately not actually responsible for the cat and certainly not responsible for cleaning up her brother's shit, from the cat or otherwise.", "NAH if you apologize. I absolutely feel the panic in the situation and I think your reaction was warranted at the time, but also, damage control is necessary.", "Nta", "Ok. I'll talk to her tonight", "You feel bad about yelling at your kid? Lol.", "You asked an 8 year old to check if the cat had poo on it.

I don\u2019t have kids yet but I really can\u2019t imagine handling this situation any differently or better than you did. We all lose our tempers when we\u2019re in crisis mode. \n\nAs for your daughter, I think she acted pretty typically for an 8-year-old. I also think you know that asking an 8-year-old to clean their sibling\u2019s shit off a cat is pretty unreasonable. Again, not faulting you because I know it was a tense situation - but that\u2019s really not her responsibility, and she\u2019s a little young for that kind of task anyway. \n\nJust apologize and explain you were overwhelmed and let your panic get the best of you. \n\nPrincess could also probably use an apology.", "NTA \n\nNothing sends a parent over the edge like an apathetic 8year old, oblivious to the panic in their household lol.

I would have lost my shit if that was my daughter! A cat running around covered in poop all over the house is nightmare fuel. You were completely in the right to yell at her because she didn\u2019t do what she was asked to, and it was very important ask.

I did not forsee the cat coming in at all as she had never done that before. I was rather preoccupied with the smell emanating from my son so I didn't even think about it.\n\nI could not reach the door fast enough without linebacker tackling my 2 year old to do it.

My daughter is extremely capable when she wants to be. We're raising her to be a strong independent woman. This was not above her capabilities. \n\nI was able to handle the cat just fine, also.

Frankly, chasing a cat and trying to wipe human poop off it with TP would be beyond the capacity of many of us. She\u2019d risk getting scratched or getting liquid human poop on her hands. I know it\u2019s different when it\u2019s your own kids poop, and you are in the nappy stage, but you are underestimating what you are asking, and how revolting other peoples poop is, and how wily cats can be. \n\nWould you be comfortable wiping up a random grandpa-with-dementia\u2019s poop from a pet? Without gloves or a face mask? I bet not.", "It's nice to raise kids to be independent. But she is still 8 years old. You really sound like expect the behaviour of a 14 year old from her.", "i dont have kids but have fun being walked all over by yours!", "No, but he did ask her to wipe off the cat. If your parent is frantically asking you to do something, and you\u2019re old enough to understand what they are asking of you, it\u2019s probably because they needed your help, so you should do it.

If it was just a little poo on the cat, the tp would have at least ensured that the majority of it would have been mostly clean until I could get there... at least in my reactionary thinking. \n\nAgain, reacting to a situation where I didn't want my cat to smear rancid poo all over the furniture and didn't know how bad it was. \n\nAll in all it was a crappy situation.", "Thank God....
