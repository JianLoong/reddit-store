Steve quickly answered, \"well well if it isn't our class fag why are you here\". I got really upset and threatened to take it outside if he had a problem with me. Some of my friends came over and so did some of Steves. It turned into a party stopping event and once everyone was paying attention, I asked him why he had such a problem with me after nearly 40 years.

This blew him up and he threatened all kinds of action and immediately started calling me a liar and some profanity laced words. I just looked at everyone in the building and said Yes, we slept together a lot and if I'm a fag I guess this makes Steve a fag as well. \n\nHis wife was standing right there, and I asked her if she wanted to compare notes on anything and before she could answer I said he had a small dick, and it bends to the right alot and then left the room. Almost everyone I went to high school with new I was gay and no one else said a word about it.
