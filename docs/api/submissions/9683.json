I do most of the house work: sweep, mop, laundry, and basic tidying up; while he does dishes and yard work. We both cook, but I cook majority of the nights because I'm home 2 hours before him and I like to have it ready for him when he gets home. We also have a 2yo daughter, he gets her ready in the morning and does drop off, and I get her ready for bed and pack her bag for the next day. \n\nFor 6 years we had the same work schedule (both teachers) and our cleaning routine worked out for us. I would be cleaning in one part of the house and he would be doing dishes or out in the yard. Last year he decided he couldn't handle being a teacher anymore and quit. His new job requires him to work 9am - 6pm (he has a commute so he's gone 8-6:45) and his days off are split and not during the weekend. \n\nI spend both of my days off cleaning and taking care of our child every week. I will regularly come home on his days off and the dishes will either be partially done or not done at all and the living room will be destroyed - toys, baby clothes, paper scattered about, food on the floor, etc. Our child will still be in PJs and he will be killing zombies. He will always tell me \"I ran out of hot water\", \"I can't get anything done unless she's napping\", \"I was busy this morning\". Ok, what about the other 7 hours I was at work? \n\nWhen I ask him to clean up the mess in the living room he will throw a fit because that's my job. I don't feel like it's my job to clean up after a grown ass man. It all came to a head today because he told me all I do is tell him how he's a piece of shit. I told him I've never called him that, but if me asking you to clean up after yourself and to do your chores makes you feel like a POS that's on you. \n\nSo reddit AITA?", "created_utc": 1676089632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10zc3kf/aita_for_not_wanting_to_do_my_chore/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Actions speak louder than words.  He expects you to clean up after him so he can play games.  What is one of the expressions associated with \"fair play?\"  Something like,  men buy their free time on the backs of thier wives household labor.", "NTA - keeping house is everyone's responsibility. He needs to take responsibility that he is half of the mess and needs to help clean up. It's not an option. We all work jobs. We all are full time parents. There's no good excuse for being a shitty partner.", "NTA\n\nYou have the same chores on your days off, yet you're able to keep up with your end of things on your days off and he's not able to keep up with his end of things on his days off.\n\nHe's the asshole in this situation.", "NTA - it sounds like you have two children not one. \nHim throwing a tempter tantrum because you\u2019re hitting him with the fact that he is indeed a grown ass man who should be assisting his wife in keeping the house\u2026 yeah. Seeing as he obviously wants to relax when he is home why would he figure you wouldn\u2019t enjoy to not have to do chores when you get home either ?", "I'm going to go with NTA on this one. Yes , he is working longer hours now and his schedule is less consistent. But if you're cleaning up and taking care of the child on your days off , then he should be doing the same on his. \n\nRegardless of changes in his schedule , it's still his home and his child as well , and he should be doing just as much to take care of things as you are. \n\nAs long as you personally didn't call him a POS , I don't think you're the a**hole at all here. \n\nMaybe he took it that way because what you said is true , and he does feel like one over it.", "NTA. As a parent who struggles to get chores done with a needy toddler, I spend my time at home WITH my child. I\u2019m not playing video games and not bothering to dress her. This shows he\u2019s being lazy, not that he\u2019s struggling to balance. He needs to put down the video games and do his part around the house.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
