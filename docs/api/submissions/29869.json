The child was there. MIL didn't say that she was telling OP something confidential. MIL is mean and deserved to be called out. The child needs to be protected from the MIL and never left alone with her without SIL or BIL being there. It's obvious that the other relatives don't have spines and will allow the child to be verbally and emotionally abused. Kudos to you for admitting you told and for standing up for what's right. I'm glad you couldn't be bought.\n\nAnd it is more important that a child isn't being abused, even if some adults' feelings are hurt. SIL felt something was wrong and needed validation to protect her child.", "Man that's a messed up situation. \n\nPersonally, I try my best to not talk about others behind their back. It's not a nice thing to do (even if it is justified) as they can't defend themselves when they aren't present.

I\u2019d be having a long talk with the husband if he agrees with MIL. Would he be okay with her treating your kids that way bc it was \u201cin private\u201d?

That\u2019s the cost of being a decent and honourable human being.  Sometimes evil people win.  You have to keep on being decent.", "NTA. Your MIL is sick.

I think as a little treat MIL shouldn\u2019t get any of grandkids until she realizes what she is doing to the entire family.
