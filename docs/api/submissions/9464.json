So for the past few days she sits alone at the table after everyone has finished their food for hours until she has to go to bed, she doesn\u2019t even eat and just stares at her food. I have caught her try to hide her food or throw it away and when she does that we just give her even more food. \n\nOur relatives and friends have questioned this and thinks its not a good way to teach her how to eat more and my husband is starting to agree with them which led to a huge argument last night.

Your daughter either has a medical or psychological problem that is causing her not to eat, and whichever it is, you are aggravating it exponentially by punishing her for it as though this is an active choice on her part and not something that she is likely already suffering over. \n\nIf this isn't already an eating disorder (which yes, can absolutely happen as young as 8) then you seem intent on making sure that it becomes one, because forcing a child to eat or punishing them until they do is one of the hallmarks of inducing disordered eating; and her response of trying to hide food or dump it is a classic sign of anorexia, among other things (to be clear, I'm not trying to diagnose her, just saying that she is already showing signs of not just \"not eating\" but active food avoidance and finding ways to get rid of food without eating it).\n\nHonestly, I can't even express how much of an AH you are and how much damage you are doing. Your child needs a doctor, as soon as possible, not punishment. I don't even know how you see a child that age refusing to eat and think, \"Yes, the best and healthiest way to approach this is to go head-to-head with her, make her feel even more antagonized than she already does, and make food into the clear enemy by punishing her into eating.\" \n\nYTA, and your handling of this rises pretty damn close to the level of abusive.", "YTA\n\nThis is not the way to handle this.

You may need to involve a child psychiatrist/therapist of some kind if there is an issue of neurodivergence or problematic relationships with food or body image. You may need to involve a dietician to find some higher caloric foods that she will eat or supplements to make sure she is not vitamin deficient. \n\nJust making her sit there until she eats will not work.", "YTA for forcing your child to eat when they're not hungry.

I'm not a professional and even if I was I wouldn't know from this post. But what I am saying is that if she's consistently sitting there for hours and hours rather than eat, this clearly isn't just a case of misbehaviour and therefore cannot be fixed with punishments.

Stop it immediately and apologize to her, and explain that you love her and are concerned about her (again, if she is unhealthily skinny). Why are you trying to make her gain weight? Has her doctor said she's an unhealthy weight or is this some subjective ideal that you possess and are projecting onto her?\n\nDoes she have any nutrient deficiencies in her bloodwork from her last physical? If it's actually disordered eating and not just normal young kid stuff - at that age you for sure are aware of your weight vs. others and social media, commercials, etc. - then she needs to see a therapist before she does long term damage to herself. \n\nBut this step should only occur after a conversation with her, and with her doctor regarding their professional opinion.\n\nShe's probably craving your support and attention and you're failing at one and giving the other in a negative, damaging way.", "YTA and holy crap, you all need serious counseling.

Set an appointment, so that you can have her checked out to make sure there are no nutrient deficiencies, no underlying physical ailments causing the issue, etc.\n\n2) In the meantime stop. Every single thing you're doing to handle this food issue is incorrect. \n\n>if we tell her that shes not allowed to leave the table until she finishes \n\nThen she's going to push and never leave the table. She's not eating it when it's fresh and appealing. She won't eat it congealed\n\n>the food we give her \n\nShe's 8 not 2, she can serve herself what she thinks she can manage to eat. \n\n>and shes not allowed to use her tablet or play with her brothers.\n\nTeaching her that you care more about what she eats than how happy she is\n\n> So for the past few days she sits alone at the table \n\nSocially isolating her\n\n>after everyone has finished their food for hours\n\nToo long for the consequence to have any meaning\n\n>until she has to go to bed, \n\nWhich means she DOES get to leave the table without eating, proving that your words have no meaning\n\n>she doesn\u2019t even eat and just stares at her food.\n\nShe's doing what you've done, focusing on her food. She just feels differently about it\n\n>I have caught her try to hide her food or throw it away \n\nBecause she isn't hungry\n\n>and when she does that we just give her even more food. \n\nTeaching her to ignore her body's hunger signals.\n\nLook, I don't blame you. It's so counterintuitive, but you need to stop.\n\n----\n\n3) While waiting for the appointment, start allowing her to serve herself, and suggest portions of half the size (or less than half) of the portions you've been serving her.\n\n4) Do not look at her plate. Don't approve/deny the serving size. Don't look at it while she's eating. Don't talk about her food or her diet or her size. Talk about random things. Ask about her day. Talk about good things she's done. Compliment good table manners or food exploration by the other children. Talk about your day. Take the focus off her food. She can't fight you about something you don't care about enough to fight for.\n\n5) Start serving different foods. Nutrient-dense, high-calorie foods, if she's genuinely underweight, will bring her weight up. It's the calories which affect weight, not the quantity of food. An entire room full of broccoli wouldn't cause her to gain a single pound.\n\n6) Get her involved in shopping for and preparing food. Kids deal with food better when they see what's in it.\n\n7) Dinner is done at a specific time. Everyone leaves the table at a certain time. It's fine to allow a dessert if the food is finished. It's not healthy to use it as a reward later, or to punish a child for eating too much or too little.\n\n8) Talk to your daughter. Separately. At a time when you're both calm, and no one is frustrated about food. Tell her you made a mistake cause adults do that sometimes, and that you're sorry you were hard on her about dinner. Tell her you want her to be healthy because you love her. Ask her why she doesn't want to eat the food. Maybe it feels weird in her throat. Maybe she's actually full. Maybe your cooking sucks. Maybe someone told her it had yucky stuff in it. Maybe someone at school called her fat. You don't know if you don't ask and *listen*\n\n9) Cut down on bulky or sugary between meal snacks or drinks other than water or Pediasure. ALL drinks including milk and juice are more sugar than nutrients. Pediasure has vitamins and minerals to help if she's lacking them.\n\n10) Go to the appointment and follow the pediatrician's recommendations", "YTA. Terrible plan. Awful.

This should be the same schedule daily if possible. Set a timer, 30 minutes for meals and 15 minutes for snacks, and when the timer goes off remove the food. In between these times, only offer water; she can have as much as she wants. Also, when playing her meal, give her about 80% of her preferred food and 20% of her non-preferred food. If clearing her plate is important to you, offer an \u201call-done bowl\u201d as an alternative to eat it. This is an empty bowl she would have at the table.

Is she full? Doesn\u2019t like it? Worried about gaining weight? Makes her feel sick? \nThen \n\nStep 1. Check with doctor to ensure she doesn\u2019t have any actual eating issues like allergies or celiac that might be making her feel ill \n\n\nStep 2.

It actually allows them to cue more into their hunger signals than the American style of eating at specific times regardless of hunger.

Maybe she has an allergy you aren't aware of that she doesn't have the language to describe beyond \"food is bad.\" Maybe she isn't hungry because she's depressed or anxious, or it's a side effect of medication she's on. Maybe she just doesn't need to eat as much as you think she does. I was a skinny kid, ate like a bird, and now I'm a (mostly) happily fat adult and still hardly ever \"finish\" a meal.\n\nTake her to the doctor, see what they say. If they think she needs better nutrition, find other ways to get it into her. She's old enough to have an opinion, so ask her what she actually likes to eat. Make sure she has constant access to healthy snacks that she enjoys. (and remember that \"healthy\" is a subjective thing. For a kid who's not eating enough, fat is a very calorie dense, essential part of their diet. And adding things like cheese and dressings to make food palatable doesn't in any way take away from the nutrients they contain. Salsa with cheese and guac and sour cream is dairy and vegetables and healthy fats.) Try smoothies. Meal replacement powders in fruit and yogurt are a valid alternative when solid food just won't go down.\n\nBottom line, what you are doing is thing to have the exact opposite effect you are going for, and will set your daughter up for a lifetime of challenging relationships with food and eating.

That never went away. Meanwhile my other brother and I are  40 lbs. overweight.  I\u2019ve lost 35 pounds but can\u2019t get over the hump.  Thanks mom and dad.

I was under 100 pounds until my early 20s. My child has been riding the 1% line their entire life. She's healthy, proportionate, and sleeps well. Can kids be finicky at eating? Sure. But forcing them like this isn't going to solve the problem without giving them life long trauma and issues. How the hell is that better?", "Truth. When this was done to me I had eaten enough. Sometimes more than I wanted, because I was trying to please the force-feeder.", "Yes!! I was a pretty fluffy kid because my family fed me SAD garbage. I learned a lot about nutrition and raised my daughter plant based. She was suuuuper skinny but she was always growing and never had issues concentrating at school or with energy levels and her doctor was never concerned.\n\nMy family thought I was giving her an eating disorder because she wasn\u2019t fat like the rest of them. I guess it\u2019s easier to blame genetics. Anyways, puberty hit and she started getting hips and curves and is still completely healthy. Family comes to me \u201cgood job finally feeding her\u201d.  The ignorance around diet and nutrition is pretty sad tbh.\n\nMy uncle just got diagnosed with diabetes. I\u2019ve been slowly trying to educate my obese 24yo cousin to help her get to a healthier weight. She told her dad to talk to me.

Glad I looked again before I really embarrassed myself by arguing with you.", "or maybe she just doesn't like to eat at mealtimes i'm like that but yes op does need to take her to a doctor to rule things out like celiac or things like that", "I\u2019m autistic and don\u2019t but I still ate when I felt weak but getting it forced on you is never the option", "Still could be a medical issue.", "Or have trouble gaining weight.

I suppose where I\u2019ve had a lot of trouble eating at times with anxiety - watching something helped a lot because I need the distraction if that makes sense.

Maybe they should have their kiddo checked", "My kid had ARFID. It is a fucking BEAST. Your child will literally starve themselves because they CAN'T eat. Their brain and body days they can't.

I was a little stick girl and I didn't have a massive appetite until I hit my teens, then I started eating more than my muscular 6'4\" stepdad and was *still* a stick. \n\nAnother thing is adults often overestimate how much children need to eat for their age (they think it's way more than it actually is).

I think op set her on that destructive behavior.", "I wouldn't trust OP blindly there. She literally forces her child to sit at the table *for hours* and adds more food to the plate when the poor kid understandably tries to get rid of it. That woman sounds crazy imo.

I just have always preferred eating small amounts but very frequently. I also knew what i liked and was stubborn about trying anything else. Now, I\u2019m totally different. I eat things that even 10 years ago I never would have considered. As long as doctors aren\u2019t concerned, parents shouldn\u2019t be either.

Jesus, is it high up on that horse?", "The original comment absolutely had that level of nuance.

That\u2019s advice sure but it\u2019s not what you\u2019re reacting to.", "Which, as others have pointed out, did NOT happen in this case. Merely suggesting a disorder to research is not even close to armchair diagnosis. Chill out.", "ARFID isn't rare lol rare to *be* diagnosed maybe, it's a new diagnosis and as a result it will take time for things to catch up, but it's not rare, it's the most common cause of disordered eating in children not linked to a physical cause. \n\nAnd you act as though any of us are making a final decision, or doing anything other than urging the mother to take her child to a doctor? What exactly is wrong about saying 'you are wrong to treat this as a behavioural issue when there could be underlying medical or psychiatric causes for this and you are jeopardising your child's health and wellbeing by not looking into the possibilities and pushing for proper evaluation and support'?"]}
