My dad married Julia when I was 13. Julia and I actually had a good relationship when they were dating, but the marriage destroyed any chance of us ever reconciling in any way. I'm 17 now.\n\nWhat happened was that my dad gave my mom's ring to Julia. This is the ring my mom gave to me (literally took it off her finger and put it in my hand) in her final days. We had a huge fight when he did it but they told me it is to bring us all closer together. It didn't.\n\nWhen my mom and dad married, it was my dad who took my mom's last name so I have that as well. After their proposal I requested that my dad can either take Julia's last name or they can go to my dad's maiden name, but I didn't want her to take my mom's last name. But they didn't listen.\n\nA year later when they had a baby together, they named her after my mom in the honor of her memory. Again I did not want that but they didn't listen. My dad insisted that this would mean they are respecting her and her memory. So the baby has my mom's first and last name, despite having no connection to her in any way.\n\nJulia has also started to wear my mom's belongings, like her dresses, shoes, watches and jewelry.\n\nJulia is not a bad or evil person. And I liked her before these issues, but after all of this there is no way for her and me to reconcile (same goes for my dad, too). We live in the same house but I don't talk to her. Every once in a while she tries to mend things between us but she's not willing to do what she needs to.\n\nLast night we went out for dinner for Julia's birthday alongside relatives from her side of the family. I didn't want to go but my dad gave me no choice. At the table I did not order food, only a glass of water. During dinner Julia was sitting right there wearing my mom's ring and earrings as my dad tried to raise a glass and give her a toast, referring to her as his wife and the mother of his \"children\" (it's just two children).\n\nI raised my glass and then poured the drink on the table as people looked at me I said \"she's not my mother\", she said \"please don't start something\" and I said \"you can steal her ring, her jewelry, her clothes, her name, it doesn't make you her\" and asked my dad if I can be excused and left.\n\nWhen they came back home my dad talked to me and told me he misspoke when he said children and I didn't need to make a scene. I told him that I didn't want to go and he made me so that's on him.\n\nLater him and Julia asked me what it would take for me to stop this \"war\" and for us to start over? I said it's simple: 1) Julia gives back my mom's ring, 2) she will not use any of my mom's belongings, and 3) They change their last name to something other than my mom's. Ideally they should also change the baby's first name but I know that's not realistic (and it's not her fault) so I'm willing to compromise on that.\n\nJulia said no. I said \"then leave me the F alone\". My dad said I'm being an asshole by creating an impossible situation.", "created_utc": 1670780127, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj0xkl/aita_for_pouring_my_drink_on_the_table_when_my/", "score": 1464, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wearing your dead mom\u2019s stuff ??? Seriously????? You and your feelings were entirely disregarded. *Everything* to do with her memory was taken and repurposed and it left you with nothing that was JUST for your mom.", "You didn\u2019t create this impossible situation. Your father and Julia did. They stole the ring your mother gave to you. That alone is just awful behaviour.

You have clearly communicated that everything they are doing is making you uncomfortable in your own home. They are both choosing to completely ignore all of your objections. They're unwilling to compromise in any way. And in fact they continue to double down. They are clearly not considering your feelings or your person in any way. They are making excuses to be able to use her property and make it seem like they are the good guys. Again, I suggest just completely ignoring them as much as possible and going no contact once you leave the house. They clearly don't respect you as a person. I appreciate you not taking it out on the child as it is truly not the child's fault, but you also have no obligation to the \"family\" at this point.

Creepy all of them.", "NTA The ring belongs to you, his only role was to keep it safe for you, it's not his place to steal it and give it to his new wife when it was never his to give. \n\nYou never created an impossible situation, he did.

It reads like some terrible lifetime movie. Like when the nanny tries to unalive and replace the wife. \nIf it is true, I'm so so sorry that your father is clearly insane. None of this is remotely okay. It is not respecting your mother. It is disturbing and insulting. Her things should have gone to you. Julia is insane too.

I'd cut ties with the whole insane thing as soon as possible. And take the ring.", "NTA. That is very weird of Julia to insert herself like that and be okay with taking EVERYTHING away from your mother\u2019s memory.

Is he really Ok with losing you or is he in that much of denial? I don\u2019t understand why he refuses to see how wrong his actions are and compromise - return the ring at least?! Just wow!", "I do not even have the words about how awful it is to be in your position", "Absolutely NTA! She sounds like she is in need of some serious therapy. Are you still able to file a police report? We\u2019re there any witnesses that the ring was given to you? (I 100% believe you, it would just help your case) Can you ask in the legal sub what your options are? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but I saw a story recently and I think that the options were to wait until you\u2019re 18 to make the report (because the statute of limitations doesn\u2019t apply yet since you\u2019re a minor) or to start a civil case and sue. Again, please double check on this. And find a local lawyer or a family member who can better advise you. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry that you\u2019re in this entire situation. They both sound insufferable. \n\nThanks for not blaming your half-sister for having your mother\u2019s name.

My dad married Julia when I was 13. Julia and I actually had a good relationship when they were dating, but the marriage destroyed any chance of us ever reconciling in any way. I'm 17 now.\n\nWhat happened was that my dad gave my mom's ring to Julia. This is the ring my mom gave to me (literally took it off her finger and put it in my hand) in her final days. We had a huge fight when he did it but they told me it is to bring us all closer together. It didn't.\n\nWhen my mom and dad married, it was my dad who took my mom's last name so I have that as well. After their proposal I requested that my dad can either take Julia's last name or they can go to my dad's maiden name, but I didn't want her to take my mom's last name. But they didn't listen.\n\nA year later when they had a baby together, they named her after my mom in the honor of her memory. Again I did not want that but they didn't listen. My dad insisted that this would mean they are respecting her and her memory. So the baby has my mom's first and last name, despite having no connection to her in any way.\n\nJulia has also started to wear my mom's belongings, like her dresses, shoes, watches and jewelry.\n\nJulia is not a bad or evil person. And I liked her before these issues, but after all of this there is no way for her and me to reconcile (same goes for my dad, too). We live in the same house but I don't talk to her. Every once in a while she tries to mend things between us but she's not willing to do what she needs to.\n\nLast night we went out for dinner for Julia's birthday alongside relatives from her side of the family. I didn't want to go but my dad gave me no choice. At the table I did not order food, only a glass of water. During dinner Julia was sitting right there wearing my mom's ring and earrings as my dad tried to raise a glass and give her a toast, referring to her as his wife and the mother of his \"children\" (it's just two children).\n\nI raised my glass and then poured the drink on the table as people looked at me I said \"she's not my mother\", she said \"please don't start something\" and I said \"you can steal her ring, her jewelry, her clothes, her name, it doesn't make you her\" and asked my dad if I can be excused and left.\n\nWhen they came back home my dad talked to me and told me he misspoke when he said children and I didn't need to make a scene. I told him that I didn't want to go and he made me so that's on him.\n\nLater him and Julia asked me what it would take for me to stop this \"war\" and for us to start over? I said it's simple: 1) Julia gives back my mom's ring, 2) she will not use any of my mom's belongings, and 3) They change their last name to something other than my mom's. Ideally they should also change the baby's first name but I know that's not realistic (and it's not her fault) so I'm willing to compromise on that.\n\nJulia said no. I said \"then leave me the F alone\". My dad said I'm being an asshole by creating an impossible situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The world stopped revolving around him the second he had a kid, and he should also be putting her mental health as a top priority.

I find it quite disturbing that your dad has somehow manipulated her into doing this and getting her to go along with it like it\u2019s what she wants. No woman in their right mind would go along with this at all. If there is anything that legally states the ring was to go to you then report it as stolen and at the very least get that back.
