Ariana and Jane we met from Bumble BFF during COVID lockdowns and they fit right in. \n\nWe\u2019re three of us are profiting monetarily from social media presences, me, Ariana, and Kim. So we are used to lots of photos but this is getting too much. \n\nAll of as are currently traveling together and skipped out on seeing our families and are spending the month in Europe- Italy, Greece, Germany and South East Asia- Thailand and Vietnam. \n\nI love all of the girls but Kim and I are without a doubt the closest. In high school she worked at my parents Chinese restaurant and we\u2019ve been inseparable ever since. She\u2019s the one that convinced me to go to college and ask out my now husband 30M and she\u2019s basically a part of my family. \n\nWe didnt have the best time in Greece but are now in Italy. Since we\u2019ve gotten here, Kim has gotten a lot of attention from locals even to the point of them getting handsy with her always shoving cameras in her face etc. \n\nIdk if they think she\u2019s a celebrity or something but it holds us up on activities every day. She just smiles waves and keeps walking but sometimes its kids or just too crowded to really get away. \n\nA reason I think its because of and something a lot of the men that approached her looked at or took photos of was her hair. Kim wears her natural curly hair in a long afro style and always has. \n\nI suggested to Kim that maybe she should straighten her hair or wear a wig while we\u2019re traveling so we dont have to stop so often. Kim askes me if I\u2019ve ever seen her wear a wig or straighten her hair and I told her no, and she said \u201cyeah and there\u2019s a damn reason\u201d and I was a little snappy and told her well no one has all day to wait for you. \n\nKim told me I was being a btch and switched rooms with one of the other girls even though we always room together and cuddle and watch movies on girls trips. We\u2019ve never not done it so only now am I realizing how mad she is after she didnt come back to the room last night and hasnt spoken to me the entire day (its like 7pm). \n\nI always cave and apologize first but ai feel like this time she\u2019s not being fair. AITA?\n\nEdit: I dont know why you all would think I\u2019m jealous over the attention from men, its not that at all. I\u2019m literally disgusted by guys for the most part lol and Kim hated it too, she\u2019s pretty anti social on a physical level and wont go to parties just because she hates it when people try to talk to her. So thats really not the case here\u2026 we literally barked at a group of guys and ran off together laughing in disgust and making fun of them for being so creepy. We were nicer to the kids but the kids were only once or twice. Also I\u2019m not white.", "created_utc": 1670783689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zj345w/aita_for_asking_my_friend_to_change_her_hairstyle/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People with hair like you describe have a long history of being criticized for it and asked to change, touched without permission, told its \u201cunprofessional\u201d, \u201cmessy\u201d, etc. Most of that criticism is rooted in racism and white superiority, eg that straight (Caucasian) hair is the standard of neatness etc., instead of how their hair is naturally. On top of this, being singled out and people touching her without permission because of her hair is also rooted in racism and is deeply dehumanizing. So she\u2019s handling that, and then instead of having her back and supporting her when people are being inappropriate, you essentially blame her and tell her to change. \n\nI imagine you didn\u2019t know all of this, and you didn\u2019t do it on purpose. But when someone is being treated differently you should always check in with them and see how they feel. You might have learned, or she might not have wanted to educate you right then. But either way you would have been demonstrating your care for her, instead of your annoyance and selfishness. \n\nYou\u2019re going to need to apologize and get some education on topics like this.", "Yta its her natural hair and you made an issue out of it. Man your a big AH.", "YTA. Asking someone with an Afro to straighten their hair or wear a wig is not a simple, easy process. Besides, natural hair is gorgeous. You sound jealous of all of the attention she\u2019s getting.", "YTA.\n\nOne straightening ones hair can be very damaging. Especially if it's textured hair because it's naturally not straight. Heat damage is a pain to repair and if it takes a LOT of heat? That's expensive as crap\n\nTwo. She's proud of her hair she shouldn't be required to hide it to make YOU feel better. Just because locals aren't used to seeing textured hair like hers doesn't mean she needs to change it for anyone else's comfort.\n\nAlso wigs are uncomfortable and trying to put her hair in a wig cap might be actually painful for her depending on how large she's grown her afro out.", "YTA\n\n\nWhy should she change her hairstyle for YOUR comfort \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "YTA Even if the premise made any sense, in what universe would you be allowed to pressure her to change her hair? Perhaps you've apologized first several times, but it's time to add another one.\n\nEdit: I noticed that you capitalized \"temporarily\" in your title as if that would convince people. That's quite the extra touch.", "Are you not aware of what a pain staking process wearing a wig or straightening natural hair is? After being friends for 10 years? My nonblack friends wouldn\u2019t dare suggest anything this fucking stupid to me \n\nYTA. \n\nAlso I disagree with the jealous take going on, no one is ever likes that shit. I experienced this in India and in Turkey and it really soured my visits.", "YTA - You don\u2019t dictate someone\u2019s hair choice. You don\u2019t tell someone they need to straighten their hair for *anyone\u2019s* comfort.\n\nYou weren\u2019t concerned about your friend being touched and approached by strangers because of her hair texture. You were concerned about *yourself* being \u201cslowed down.\u201d Dealing with ignorant people is much more of an inconvenience for *her* and she knows a lot more about it than you do. And she\u2019s comfortable enough in herself to *not* change herself to appease people.\n\nAs a friend you should be supporting her as I\u2019m sure this whole experience has been uncomfortable for *her.* Instead you make it about yourself and your comparatively minor inconvenience. Get over yourself.", "Of course YTA. Leave her hair alone.", "YTA. Hugely.  She's attracting attention.  This makes YOU uncomfortable.  As a \"socialite\" with a profitable \"social media  presence \", I suspect that part of your issue is that *she's* attracting attention that you aren't.  \n\nHer hair is part of her identity,  personally and publicly.  You essentially asked her to wear a disguise.  That sucks.  Apologize.", "YTA. It's her hair. \n\nIt seems kinda fake,  this story.  That she's being treated like a celebrity, but I guess that's irrelevant a bit. \n\nSupposing its true, who are you to tell her how to wear her hair?", "LOL YTA. You live the \"socialite life and three of us are profiting monetarily from social media presences\" and you're upset someone (not you) is getting the attention. Influencers are a cancer on society already so you'd be the AH for that anyway.", "YTA. Just call a spade a spade: you're jealous. You are way too old for that pitiful behavior. If she sprained her ankle on the trip, would you tell her she needs to catch an early flight home because \"no one has all day to wait for her\"? No, you would recognize that would make you a selfish failure of a friend - much like now.", "YTA. one million percent YTA. \n\nhow dare you project your insecurities and frustration on someone else and ask them to change their hair because it's inconvenient for you. like, who do you think you are? get over yourself. not everything is about you. I'm with Kim on this one - I'd probably ignore you the rest of the trip. \n\nhopefully you see how unreasonable, inconsiderate and inappropriate you're being before the trip goes any further. you owe the other girls an apology and if you don't see why you're in the wrong, you might as well go home now.\n\nedit: you also come across as jealous. if you were getting that attention, you probably wouldn't have a problem with it.", "YTA. Imagine trying to demand that someone change their appearance to accommodate your jealousy and insecurities.", "YTA\n\nYou feel like she's not being fair? You think this is on her? Let's look at this, she has not asked for the attention and you are expecting her who change her hair style when historically women with naturally curly and afro hair have basically been told their hair is wrong.", "YTA. I mean, there's no reasonable way you are not an asshole here. Just listen to what you said. Reread this story. And if you don't realize how big an AH you are being to your friend, read it again.", "YTA and sound racist. It seems like you\u2019re jealous of the attention she\u2019s getting from strangers and can\u2019t stand to not be in the spotlight. Grow up and get a real job.", "YTA. It sounds like you may be jealous of the attention she's getting, but you're travelling to a range of countries and culture so I'm sure you'll all have your time in the spotlight. If she's your best friend, be kind and supportive, and let her take the lead on how she responds to the attention.", "Yep. YTA. Apologize.", "Also.  I doubt it's for everyone's comfort. Seems like it's just yours.", "YTA. Not only is it her hair, it\u2019s something that she would have been discriminated for before, and you telling her to change it probably makes you the same in her eyes, which is disappointing for a friend", "YTA. There are countless essays written about Black women's hair, and the racist history of controlling them, that can explain why she got so upset.", "YTA", "YTA. Everything you said to explain yourself makes no sense. Let her get the attention, and if it\u2019s bothering you all that much, maybe you should ask yourself why. It's okay to feel jealous, and a great opportunity for self-work (given this is the reason - only you can tell). Have you asked her how does she feel about this whole thing? \nBe a friend. And if you girls are so close, don't just be a friend, be HER friend.", "YTA. You typed all that out and didn't realize it? Your jealousy is radiating off of you in waves. Apologize if you want to keep her as a friend.", "I wonder if you have any idea of the amount of work it would take to straighten curly hair while traveling. Since you are such good friends, you have seen her style her hair, right. The time and effort into natural styling. Do you have time I your agenda for a 2-3 straightening process? Or for the additional deep conditioning the heat will require weekly? Or additional product and equipment required for her to carry around.\n\nI think there is some ignorance on your part of the cultural insensitivity you are displaying. Just the fact that you think it's ok to ask her to change a major thing like her hair care routine while traveling is not ok. Her response should have made that impression on you. Straighteninh her hair is not a small thing like it is for you. As a close friend, you should get that. And a wig? Come on. Alter you appearance so we are all more comfortable. Not a solution.\n\nSorry but YTA.", "Sorry but YTA. That was selfish of you to ask her. And she has right to wear he hair as she likes. Do you have so perfect hair that you look awesome with every hairstyle? Cause not all of us do. Some hairstyles are flattering and some make you look like a month-rotting zombie. Plus I bet she is proud of her curly hair. You don't have any right to ask her to change her look. I get where you're coming from, I don't think you're jealous of the attention she gets but you don't get to ask her, anyone, that. You should apologize.", "YTA. Sounds like jealousy. Get over yourself. If this is even real", "YTA. You don\u2019t dictate how someone\u2019s hair should look. And if your friend is a POC then you\u2019re also racist.", "YTA for sure. No one needs to change their hairstyle for you. Apologize.\n\nSecond, stop waiting around for her. If you have some group activity, just go. You're both making choices here. You all are choosing to wait around. She is choosing to stop. If it bothers you so much then stop waiting for her. She'll either catch up later or stop stopping.", "YTA\nLet her wear her natural hair, it's not your hair so it's not your decision", "Yta. Hair is personal and no one has any place to tell someone what to do with what's on their head.", "YTA. Don\u2019t tell women not to wear their natural hair. Don\u2019t perpetrate these systemic issues. I cannot believe the level of ignorance here that you would tell her to change her natural hair for your comfort.", "Yta, what if you are in another country where maybe someone with dark skin is less common and people start flocking to your friend because of her dark skin color? Would you ask her to look more white? Never ask someone to change how they look. Ever.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are a toxic AH, and you killed a friendship.", "YTA. Your friend is getting a lot of attention, you make an assumption about why, and then want them to change that thing, based on an assumption.", "YTA. You sound jealous of the attention she\u2019s getting.", "You want your \"friend\" that you consider \"family\" to potentially damage her natural hair with a wig, or heat because you're upset that she gets a lot of attention.  YTA and a shitty friend.", "Holy shait..\n\nAre you for real? Yes, YTA.\n\nPlease educate yourself.\n\nAlone the idea YOU asking HER to change her natural hair!?\n\nIt's easy to find articles or videos which should you, how much damage it will cause to straighten the hair, and how much of care and time your former friend have to take for healthy hair - -\n\nI hope for you, you overthink your action, and with some luck your former friend will explain to you, how hurtful and racist you were to her.", "Haha. This is the weirdest one yet. YTA. Like a lot. How is this even a discussion for you? Apologizing is not caving, it\u2019s admitting you are jealous and that you realize that. Grow up, please.", "YTA. You definitely do need to apologise. Kim does not need to change her hair for ANYONE. It is not her fault she's getting attention, nor is it her fault that this bothers you. You don't even know that her hair is the reason she's getting this attention; maybe she has a striking face, who knows - the point is she doesn't have to change a thing about her appearance. Try celebrating her and being happy instead of feeling miffed that she's getting some spotlight time.", "YTA, you can\u2019t tell someone with curly hair to change their hairstyle. There\u2019s a massive amount of discrimination placed upon those with that hair type (I myself am white with curly hair).\nImagine getting a job and them tell you \u201cyou have to have pin curls every single day and look like this but we\u2019re not going to give you any incentive and are going to discriminate against you if you leave your hair straight\u201d", "YTA. I think you deservedly have one less friend now.", "YTA. It's not her fault that she is getting unwanted attention. The only exception to it being her fault for the attention would be if she specifically tries to egg it on in some way. However, asking her to change her hairstyle is never going to be the right approach. She could try maybe wearing a face mask or something to try and make things less chaotic if it's really a problem. She should not have called you a b word. However, I think if this friendship is important to you, which it sounds like it is, you should apologize and ask her what she thinks could maybe work to minimize the delays you guys are facing. And know that there may not be a solution. Also, she is probably extremely frustrated as well and doesn't need to be made to feel like it's her fault for existing (not saying you were implying that, but in the heat of the moment things can come off even worse.). I hope you two work it out and get back to enjoying your holiday.", "YTA.  Why would you assume you have the right to do that?  Especially to do something so out of character.  You need to apologise.", "YTA", "YTA.", "Wow. Admidst everything going on in today's world, I just find it difficult to believe this is a legitimate post. And if it is.. Just... Wow. No words.", "YTA \n\nAre you mad that the attention is interfering with the trip or that Kim is getting the attention while you aren't? I have a strong feeling it's the latter. \n\nAlso, the solutions you presented suck. Straightening naturally curly hair isn't a quick process. It can also damage the hair and takes a lot of time and effort to undo. As for a wig, those can be really hot and uncomfortable for some people. And ultimately it's Kim's hair. She shouldn't have to change or hide it just because of you. \n\nIf you can't understand why you're wrong and offer Kim a genuine apology be prepared for this friendship to end.", "YTA. Your type are the worst kind of people.", "YTA, the stench of jealousy is pervasive", "Once again, why do people come here asking if they are the asshole, and then proceed to argue when told that yes, you indeed are an asshole?", "YTA. I\u2019m also not sure why changing her hair would help. It doesn\u2019t sound like unusual hair.", "YTA in a major way. Seems like ur still in denial about it tho. U need to apologize asap but i doubt it'll repair this friendship", "Absolutely YTA.\n\nQuit body shaming and projecting your jealousy issues onto your \"friend\"'s appearance.\n\nAlso, based on the post, if she's a POC, you're an extra racist AH for suggesting it", "Please don't come to Greece again, we'd appreciate it\ud83d\udc4d", "OP casually ignoring everybody saying this has racist implications and she is extremely ignorant to the trials and tribulations that black people face for simply deciding to wear their hair naturally and that she needs to apologize for attempting to dictate an important part of her friends appearance/identity for her own temporary convenience and focusing on everybody who says she's jealous and insisting she's not...girl...I'd be a lot more worried about being told I'm racist than being told I'm jealous. This is just embarrassing. Grow up, learn to take accountability, educate yourself, and apologize. Sincerely apologize. YTA\n\nETA Not being white does not excuse your behavior and your friend still deserves an apology. It's still not your hair, you were out of line and you need to acknowledge this.", "Socialite life? That phrase alone makes you an asshole. Coupled with your racism - it\u2019s gaping.", "All of you social media influencer types are assholes.", "YTA so much! Go apologize for your ridiculous and racist request now!", "People are being racist and fetishizing to her so your response is to be racist to her too? YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019re telling a black woman to do something about her hair because it\u2019s making YOU uncomfortable. You do realize that your statement is a microagression and extremely offensive right? She has every right to be mad at you", "Get help. Your OP sounds jealous as hell, and all your comments are to tell people you aren't jealous. Maybe if you comment one more time to say you don't like attention from men, you'll believe it \ud83d\ude43 YTA", "YTA but I think it's our of genuine ignorance.  Educate yourself on why natural hair is important (it sounds like she's a black woman, and black women have a very long history of white people telling them that their natural hair is inappropriate..)  Do some googling then explain what you've learned and that you hadn't fully understood what you were asking of her.  I think she'd understand that.  You'll no longer be TA if you do that, and never do this again.  Then it'll be N A H", "This is some racist BS. YTA. Don\u2019t ever tell anyone to straighten their curls or wear a wig ever again.", "you clearly don\u2019t understand the history and sanctity that is black hair. stop policing what black women do with their hair. \nYTA.", "YTA - you sound racist and petty. You are all socialites and make money as influencers and by taking pictures on these trips but it's clear that she's more popular than you are so you want her to change what's giving her more attention than you.

Don\u2019t know what else we could so in that situation.", "I\u2019m in UI/UX AI. Social media is a side hustle. I didn\u2019t say it was my career.", "Obviously\u2026? She hates it, I thought that went without saying", "She definitely does on both, but when she says no people should respect it not keep grabbing at her. Thats just rude and gross.", "I think when someones grabbing your legs, arms, and waist its pretty sexual, yeah theres a language barrier and we dont understand much of what they\u2019re saying but its mostly compliments/cat calls and are grabbing towards her hair", "Yes, ininsuating women enjoy sexual harassment is definitely triggering as someone who was raped and told they enjoyed it.", "Maybe those \"old men\" have already done their \"unboxing\" or \"reacting\" videos for the week and are enjoying the fruits of their labor.", "Not harassing people I guess.", "Again.. no one is jealous of getting fucking molested in the street good grief. She just handles it better from being more used to it but I found it disgusting and empathized that with her when she was upset about it.", "Yeah, because insinuating women enjoy being groped is rude.", "Its not. Like millions of other jobs", "As a note, Asian hair has definitely been *fetishized* in the Western world, but that's a seperate topic.", "Huh? She cried four times. She definitely hates it. Maybe thats not obvious but we barked at them and ran away\u2026 she doesn\u2019t like guys talking to her haha", "They were quoting you.", "yikes...", "So you decide to act racist?", "Do you hear yourself?? This is the same logic people use when women are sexually harassed and people ask what they\u2019re wearing. \n\n\u201cWell it\u2019s not your FAULT but if you just weren\u2019t wearing something like THAT then it wouldn\u2019t happen\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re a massive AH and likely racist on top of that, you need to do some unpacking about why you think it\u2019s your friends responsibility to stop being harassed rather than for you or anyone else to help her get away from those people faster.", "\"I can't stop men so cover yourself/change yourself instead\" you should like every other asshole that victim blames. What wouldve happened had you not been a dick to your friend? Do you think your friend is smart enough to figure out that her hair was the reason for so many people stopping y'all? Cause I'm sure she did. Then the question becomes are you smart enough to figure out why she wouldn't go out of her comfort zone by following your request? It was racist to suggest she straighten her hair so the effects of having a friend with that hair type stop effecting you", "Listen, you asked if you were the asshole for asking your friend to change her hair so she\u2019d stop being harassed and you guys could live out your perfect vacatation fantasy and guess what, you are. You don\u2019t get to dictate what she does to make your life easier it\u2019s that simple", "What no way to communicate with the people around you ??? Google translate ? You can\u2019t learn some simple words to tell them to stop petting her because she\u2019s not an animal ??? \nYTA\nStop blaming her and go defend your friend !", "No, it does not. Everyone has a different threshold. If she has not said she hates it, don't assume. Also, even if she does, you don't get to tell her how to handle it. A caring, sensitive suggestion? Sure. Not a racist, unkind demand. Take your overwhelming YTA judgment and do better.", "No, I don't think she hates it as much as you think she does. She would change it if she didn't like the attention it brought her but she doesn't change it, so therefore it seems she likes the attention it brings her.", "i agree but its the old saying the moths to the flame.  i have long hair natural dark hair and it shines and no matterwhere i go ppl want to touch it or ask if its real or not.  its wierd and ppl these days just dont understand stay out of ones personal space", "You're deflecting from the actual issue. This dialogue is over.", " Also I have realized i went about it in totally the wrong way now. And do want to apologize. But I felt like I deserved a little more consideration as her friend, doe her to know I didnt mean SHE was the problem. She should be adored by everyone and anyone but RESPECTFULLY like she deserves. Not these dirty old men grabbing at her when they dont even deserve to look at let alone touch her.", "Some of your comments have mentioned a language barrier as you describe not knowing if they understand, maybe learn basic words for the countries your in like No etc to help the situation a little? \n\nBut you may want to be a little less crass about it as one comment i saw you called them small minded when you don't know that, this could litterally be a language thing.", "Dude you didn\u2019t depict it that way in your story. Don\u2019t twist this now putting words in my mouth. \n\nIf its harassment then of course its not right and its disgusting. From the way you said that it sounded more that you were jealous. \n\nIf thats not the case then great", "Nah. *Some* other jobs. Not millions. And I doubt the people doing those jobs are as proud of themselves as \"influencers\" (i.e., moochers) are.", "My just is in reference of the main comment, as guys on the street cant have an effect besides annoying and harassing", "Sure I agree but I don\u2019t think its a problem to suggest or ask it considering how close we are. If I was a stranger its a different story.", "We did keep saying \u201cfermare fermare por favor\u201d and it didnt help any. Sometimes old ladies would come out from shops and whistle and shoo them off for a little bit but thats it.", "I dont think thats the case and pretty fucked too, she is just wearing it how her hair grows. The problem is the people that are not as knowledgeable. I only suggested it for the next few days until we leave Italy. Like while we in Greece I wore shades because of what was being said to me.", "But I described what happened and you\u2019re discussing an imaginary scenario. Stay on topic", "You are still making it about yourself when YOU asked her to change something that is part of her identity as a black woman. You're not even the one being harassed, it's her. Stop making it about you.", "But you're \"literally just regular people.\" What do the peasants have to do to be worthy of looking at her in public?", "I did learn how to say no and please stop but outside of that I say it so wrong I guess they dont understand? At least they dont react", "What else would stopping a stranger in the street shocing cameras in her face and getting handsy mean?", "Yes, I am definitely proud of making money for doing next to nothing. No consumption under capitalism is exactly ethical, but it gives me the freedom I wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Oh well", "\u201cHow dare you quote me verbatim.\u201d YTA, get over yourself.", "I think it\u2019s the fact that you are so close that\u2019s upsetting her. As her best friend you shouldn\u2019t be implying that SHE\u2019S the problem. You should know how important her natural hair is to her and how wearing it makes her feel but to her you\u2019ve completely belittled that because you\u2019re bothered by the attention.", "It is because it's racist. I've had \"friends\" comment on how my hair would look better if I just .... before. The micro-agression is honestly sickening and a surefire way to end our friendship", "Then why on earth did you bother asking? If you\u2019re going to argue with everyone who says YTA (you are) why ask? I think you only posted here because you thought you\u2019d be validated, *not* to honestly find out if you were wrong.", "I am sorry but if you were really her friend and close to her you would never asked that from her because you would have known that straightening her hair would damage it and a good quality wing is expensive. \n\nIf she got long hair it means she takes really good care of them and it's not a easy process. So you telling her to hide or damage her hair for your comfort doesn't scream we are friends", "Your comment(s) violate [rule 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/index#wiki_3._accept_your_judgement).

It's paving the way for more idiot politicians who made a popular TikTok video and now the morons will vote for them for the highest offices. It's literally helping destroy society.

Even made a \u201chigher the hair the closer to Jesus\u201d joke because she likes Dolly Parton so I got annoyed when she immediately took offense to it cus shes usually not like that. Shes pretty anti social on a personal level and having that many people in her face was definitely making her moodier than usual I felt\n\nLike she can\u2019t even go to parties because people are standing too close, and wont live in a major city for the same reason", "It\u2019s not on her to change how she looks to stop men from looking at her.

Have you tried telling them they don't deserve to look at you?", "I didn\u2019t tell it well, I thought it would be assumed that no one likes being followed by a group of 6-8 men at all hours of the day and being grabbed by them.
