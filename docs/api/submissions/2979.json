Long story short, she begged with tears  that she would  do all the house chores (we have the maid for that) and cook. I enforced my decision and reminded her I would  pick up Lilith later. Emily  was laughing  behind me(she heard the phone call) and told  me not to bother with  her. After picking up Lilith, I got an abrupt phone call from her parents. They  called  me a \"disgusting spoiled cunt\" for being  selfish  and cruel.

You're of course not obligated to take her in if you aren't comfortable doing so.  \n\nYour girlfriend SUCKS though.

Molly isn't.  Sounds like you found that line well.  Molly's parents can take Molly in if necessary.  \n\nEmily's behavior was rude and tactless.  You've said she laughs at everything, so it may be that she laughs in stressful or uncomfortable situations.  However, it was still rude and tactless, and you should have a conversation with her about being more respectful towards Molly.

Sounds like Emily thinks the same thing and perhaps her laughing was her hearing what a pathetic attempt to guilt OP was happening.  I don't know.  I wasn't there.

Bc just it wasn\u2019t to her face or she didn\u2019t hear it, doesn\u2019t make it right/okay. But yeah no that\u2019s an asshole move. Your girl friend is the bigger ass hole though bc should could very well end up in your BMs situation one day lol", "It doesn\u2019t matter. There has to be some level of respect for her being your daughters mother. I understand that the history is probably not the best between you two.

Can you explain what exactly was funny about the situation?", "I mean baby mama was being kind of unhinged crying and begging like she did. She was being inappropriate.

This makes me wonder if there are rules in certain countries about this. If they were never legally married, why would one have to pay for the other to have a roof over their heads?

She seems like AH.", "Probably not, but his question was about letting his ex move in. I feel that it is never good to live with an ex.

But if they aren't even willing/able to offer Molly a floor to sleep on,her parents have no right to call the OP names.", "I did say in another comment that his girlfriend is an A H.

He is not responsible for supporting his EX.", "Okay this is shitty thing to say. \nYTA for this comment alone. \nYou should want your daughter to have a good relationship with her mom, not be gleeful that she seems to like you better (I wonder if that has anything to do with you seeming to have more money). \nIt\u2019s fine to not offer Molly a place to live, but you\u2019re kind of coming off as a person who is capitalizing on this woman\u2019s hard times to separate her daughter from her.", "The more I read of your comments the more I think you are a possessive, slimy dick void of any feelings.   \nThis is starting to sound more and more like you grabbing an opportunity to fuck your ex over and alienate her daughter from her at the same time.", "Your Lilith\u2019s only 3.

To be honest if someone who had treated me badly came to my partner and I asking to move in with us rent free and wouldn\u2019t take the no as an answer I might laugh too. I wouldn\u2019t wish ill on them and would hope they\u2019d find a way out of their situation but the audacity of such a big request when you have a poor relationship would be incredible to me.

And he doesn\u2019t care that the girlfriend is enjoying the misery of the ex. I have mental illnesses that are not my fault. Sometimes I do shitty things like lashing out to my loved ones. I still apologize and try to make it up because, while it\u2019s the result of illness, it\u2019s still my fault if I affect others and don\u2019t hold myself accountable. He\u2019s not holding himself accountable. How is he going to take in a baby? He\u2019s absolutely TA for taking the baby and for letting the cruel ex near said baby.

This baby mama was told no and was manipulative. That makes people extremely uncomfortable and everyone reacts differently. I've seen people laugh at their own family members dying because it's how they processed grief. The laughing thing is certainly weird, but I can't be sure if it was malicious unless I was there.

Ugh.

But everything he's commented is concerning, down to saying he won't be nice to anyone unless it's necessary. And the confirmation that he was abused as a child. All of it is really concerning to see a child move into being around, especially on a full-time basis. \n\nHes not the asshole for not letting his child's mother move in, nessisarily, but all of his comments do not look like someone that has decent coping skills to be a caring and effective parent.", "only thing i can tell you is good luck and since empathy isnt easy for you, remember that your daughter will always remember how you treat her mother and it will impact her life. Who i am to judge your gf, but think about  the big picture and that in the end your daughter is the most important person in your life. That is coming from a girl who parent divorce and had to hear them bad mouthing each other all the time."]}
