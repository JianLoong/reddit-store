He came to me and told me to allow her to kiss the baby on the head and I said no kissing a new born because of disses and germs.

He told me I am being absurd and controlling and since other people will follow my other rules then I should allow his mom and grandma to kiss the baby.

My words to him in response to the statistics would be \"You'd rather risk your baby becoming a damn statistic than say no to mommy? YOU'RE 22 YEARS OLD, YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE A FATHER. GROW THE FUCK UP.\"\n\nDon't forget that you as the mother do have the right and the ability to kick anyone you want, including him, out of the hospital room during and after labor.

Your boundaries here are very reasonable.  As far as the hospital, as the patient you can set limits on who is allowed to visit and the hospital will enforce them.  If you tell them that his family can\u2019t come, and that you expect them to try anyway, they\u2019ll keep watch over your room and bounce people on your \u201cdo not allow\u201d list.  If your husband and his family can\u2019t be trusted to respect your desire to rest, recover, and bond with the baby, ask the hospital to help you, because they will.\n\nSure, it\u2019s his baby too, which is why he\u2019s allowed.  It\u2019s not his mom\u2019s baby or his grandma\u2019s baby, so they need to wait until *both* you and he are ready to have visitors.  He doesn\u2019t get to override you like that.\n\nIt\u2019ll be harder to fight him about people kissing the baby, because you won\u2019t have the hospital staff ready to defend you, but you\u2019re right there, too.  Only the people the baby lives with should be kissing them during its first month of life.  RSV is a mild cold for most adults, but it can be hospitalization or death for a newborn.  Why does your husband care more about his mommy\u2019s delicate fee-fees than he does his baby\u2019s health, maybe even its life?", "NTA\n\nYour husband should not ask you to compromise so that his mother is happy. Your husband has a duty and an obligation to ask HIS mother to make compromises so that his wife, who has just given BIRTH, is tired and discovering motherhood, is less stressed.\n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with your husband. The most important thing is not other people's feelings or whether it's \"fair\", the most important thing is your well-being. Before being the baby's room, the hospital room is YOUR room as a patient recovering from CHILDBIRTH. Your husband didn't give birth and should be your support when you're tired and at the end of your rope, not your enemy. If he isn't planning in respecting your requests, talk to the nurses and forbid visits.\n\nAnd by the way, kissing a newborn is extremely dangerous and can land him in hospital. Ever heard of RSV ? You should send a link to your husband and let him meditate, he's putting his mother's whims before his baby's health and life.", "NTA.\nIt's sucks that he cares more about his mother's feelings than the safety and wellbeing of you and your baby. \nYou should be focusing on your upcoming birth, preparing to welcome your baby, not being stressed about people crossing your valid boundaries. \nYour mother in law sounds insufferable and manipulative.", "This is not going to be a great answer. \n\nIs this your first baby? If yes, ask the same question after 2 weeks.\n\nMet someone who had the same approach. Today she regrets it, 17 years later. I'm not going to say YTA or NTA. Things will not go according to the books you're reading after baby is born. If you asked \"AITA for not wanting family to attend the birth?\" yeah, easy one. \n\nTo be fair, yes, take a few days before announcing the birth so you're not overwhelmed by people messaging you trying to visit at all hours.\n\nBut watch immediate family. Tread carefully. Been there, done that. (EDIT) Have a MIL just like yours. You will have to have a go at her without your husband around, but not right after baby's born.

However, one thing I would advise is this: don't assume that being the mother means you get final say in everything. Whether you like it or not, your husband is just as much that baby's parent as you. He gets equal say.

Tell your husband if he\u2019s not gonna respect your boundaries, then when you\u2019re discharged, you won\u2019t be going home with him. You\u2019ll be going home with your mother. Send him a video of babies with RSV. It is very real and can be very deadly. You also should tell him that people that are going to be visiting the baby need to have a current T dap shot. Yes, it is his baby too, but it\u2019s his job to put you and the baby first and deal  with his family. If he refuses to, then, as a mama, you can put your baby safety first. If he cannot respect your boundaries, that were put in place to protect your kiddo, then he can come visit you as much as he wants to at your mothers house. That will give you a safe place to recover. It\u2019s OK to have boundaries, and that\u2019s your mother instinct kicking in. Listen to that. You really do need to put your foot down now, or it will get worse and you will be over run with his family. I would have a serious discussion with him that it\u2019s time to put you and the baby as his priority and stand up to his mom. Your baby is a real life person, not a toy.

I get that you want precautions in place and you have every right to that. You have the right to choose who is in delivery with you. After the baby is born, it's not 100 percent about you.

But after everyone has met the baby, I want  to not have other people come by every day while I am recovering. What would you say it's a good time for people to come over to meet the baby after it's born? For me, I think 2 hours after is too little time for me to feel good for visitors. As for the 2 weeks that is not for meeting the baby for the first time but for spending more time with the baby after meeting it, and having everyone else come up that didn't get to meet the baby at the hospital. Also, none of his family will be vaccinated, and they think vaccines are ridiculous. So I couldn't ask them to do that, because I felt like that was going to cause more issues. I just don't understand why they can't wait till baby is 3 months and vaccinated for kisses. I already also spoke with my family about the rules, and no one had issues with them. It's not like I am picking and choosing people that can't and can do things.", "Ask him, if he just shat out a baseball, would he want to have some  time to recover and rest and deal with the pain and mess, or would he want your mother visiting right away, while he\u2019s exhausted and in pain and covered in the mess that comes from that kind of massive effort.\n\nYou\u2019re not being selfish, his mother is.

He can't decide that two hours will be enough for you, he's not the one pushing out a human. Make it clear to him and the hospital staff that you don't want any visitors at the hospital, the staff will honour your wishes and prevent people from visiting.
