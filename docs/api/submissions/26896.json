He came to me and told me to allow her to kiss the baby on the head and I said no kissing a new born because of disses and germs. He told me I need to make a compromise and give that up to make his mom happy. I don't want to because people can't simply understand that kissing a newborn in dangerous. He tried doing a lot of math and statistics to show me its not a big deal, and how unlikely the baby is to get sick. He told me I am being absurd and controlling and since other people will follow my other rules then I should allow his mom and grandma to kiss the baby.

This is literally the life of your child. Head on over to /r/JUSTNOMIL , you'll be in good company there.\n\n\nHe's trying to make you cave because he knows his mom won't and you're the path of least resistance, since you actually have empathy and aren't a raging narcissist. My words to him in response to the statistics would be \"You'd rather risk your baby becoming a damn statistic than say no to mommy? YOU'RE 22 YEARS OLD, YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE A FATHER. GROW THE FUCK UP.\"\n\nDon't forget that you as the mother do have the right and the ability to kick anyone you want, including him, out of the hospital room during and after labor. You can tell the nurses who is and isn't allowed, and they will physically remove any unwanted visitors from the room. **Again, this is your baby's life.\n**", "NTA.  Your boundaries here are very reasonable.  As far as the hospital, as the patient you can set limits on who is allowed to visit and the hospital will enforce them.  If you tell them that his family can\u2019t come, and that you expect them to try anyway, they\u2019ll keep watch over your room and bounce people on your \u201cdo not allow\u201d list.  If your husband and his family can\u2019t be trusted to respect your desire to rest, recover, and bond with the baby, ask the hospital to help you, because they will.\n\nSure, it\u2019s his baby too, which is why he\u2019s allowed.  It\u2019s not his mom\u2019s baby or his grandma\u2019s baby, so they need to wait until *both* you and he are ready to have visitors.  He doesn\u2019t get to override you like that.\n\nIt\u2019ll be harder to fight him about people kissing the baby, because you won\u2019t have the hospital staff ready to defend you, but you\u2019re right there, too.  Only the people the baby lives with should be kissing them during its first month of life.  RSV is a mild cold for most adults, but it can be hospitalization or death for a newborn.  Why does your husband care more about his mommy\u2019s delicate fee-fees than he does his baby\u2019s health, maybe even its life?", "NTA\n\nYour husband should not ask you to compromise so that his mother is happy. Your husband has a duty and an obligation to ask HIS mother to make compromises so that his wife, who has just given BIRTH, is tired and discovering motherhood, is less stressed.\n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with your husband. The most important thing is not other people's feelings or whether it's \"fair\", the most important thing is your well-being. Before being the baby's room, the hospital room is YOUR room as a patient recovering from CHILDBIRTH. Your husband didn't give birth and should be your support when you're tired and at the end of your rope, not your enemy. If he isn't planning in respecting your requests, talk to the nurses and forbid visits.\n\nAnd by the way, kissing a newborn is extremely dangerous and can land him in hospital. Ever heard of RSV ? You should send a link to your husband and let him meditate, he's putting his mother's whims before his baby's health and life.", "NTA.\nIt's sucks that he cares more about his mother's feelings than the safety and wellbeing of you and your baby. \nYou should be focusing on your upcoming birth, preparing to welcome your baby, not being stressed about people crossing your valid boundaries. \nYour mother in law sounds insufferable and manipulative.", "This is not going to be a great answer. \n\nIs this your first baby? If yes, ask the same question after 2 weeks.\n\nMet someone who had the same approach. Today she regrets it, 17 years later. I'm not going to say YTA or NTA. Things will not go according to the books you're reading after baby is born. If you asked \"AITA for not wanting family to attend the birth?\" yeah, easy one. \n\nTo be fair, yes, take a few days before announcing the birth so you're not overwhelmed by people messaging you trying to visit at all hours.\n\nBut watch immediate family. Tread carefully. Been there, done that. (EDIT) Have a MIL just like yours. You will have to have a go at her without your husband around, but not right after baby's born. It worked for me, but you'll need time.", "I am going with ESH.\n\nI do not think any of you are handeling this well. \n\nBUT, there needs to be a compromise as you **ARE BOTH this child's parents. Pregnancy and childbirth is 100% about the mother, but once that baby comes you are no longer a dictator of your own pregnancy, but a co-parent of a new baby.** \n\nSo I say again. Compromise. \n\nYou both need to come to a mutual decision on posting photos of the baby online - and if you cant - I worry for your relationship. I am actually 100% in favour of not having kids all over social media. But maybe there is a middle ground - only you or he can post photos, and you both have to agree on the photo. The family wants you to post photos so they do not miss out, so set up a private photosharing app so granny and aunty can see 10 photos a day - I think my close friends use Tinybeans. Have a strict rule on not sending them on to anyone. This is really normal. \n\nAs for the visit. *Dictating he cannot introduce his parents to his baby for 2 weeks is ridiculous - and this is why you are an arsehole*. Find a compromise. Standard I have seen is both your parents immediately; close family (your siblings; grandparents) and best friends within 48 hours, and everyone else around the month mark. If you dont want them to come into the room after giving birth that is fine, but that does mean he cannot take the baby out to meet them in the waiting area for a quick - look I have a son/daughter. \n\nBUT, you are being reasonable about the kissing. Make a compromise, no one meets baby without their vaccinations including whooping cough booster; no one kisses baby until baby is fully vaccinated.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Mama's boy needs to be more thoughtful of what his wife is going through.", "NTA\n\nI don't know what statistics he's cherry-picking, but pretty much every major medical outlet tells you not to let anyone kiss your child for 2-3 months. There are a multitude of reasons for this that all have to do with potential illnesses. Your child's health is more important than their feelings. Repeat this to them over and over.", "NTA. You need to talk to the hospital and nurses about who can be in your room post delivery. Tell the nurses that any family members are not to be let in!! Most nurses will have your back on this because they understand what it\u2019s like. This is your choice and your BF clearly doesn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to give birth. This is your choice and yours alone. Good luck!!", "NTA. As you will need time to rest and recover. However, one thing I would advise is this: don't assume that being the mother means you get final say in everything. Whether you like it or not, your husband is just as much that baby's parent as you. He gets equal say. So I would say that you two need to sit down like adults and discuss this rather than acting like it's your way or the highway. Because that's what your post makes it seem like.", "NTA \n\nWhile you are in the hospital, get explicit instructions to the hospital staff about everything and about who is allowed to do what and who is not allowed to do what. \n\nOnce you leave the hospital, if you need to go somewhere else, a friends house, your relatives house a hotel \n\nI personally think your rule district to the point of being weird as hell \nBut you do have a right to them", "NTA- you\u2019re the one giving birth. While you\u2019re in the hospital, when you get there, tell the nurses you don\u2019t want any visitors except who you want to be allowed in. If you\u2019re in the US, they check IDs before you\u2019re allowed to go on the maternity floor. Tell your husband if he\u2019s not gonna respect your boundaries, then when you\u2019re discharged, you won\u2019t be going home with him. You\u2019ll be going home with your mother. Send him a video of babies with RSV. It is very real and can be very deadly. You also should tell him that people that are going to be visiting the baby need to have a current T dap shot. Yes, it is his baby too, but it\u2019s his job to put you and the baby first and deal  with his family. If he refuses to, then, as a mama, you can put your baby safety first. If he cannot respect your boundaries, that were put in place to protect your kiddo, then he can come visit you as much as he wants to at your mothers house. That will give you a safe place to recover. It\u2019s OK to have boundaries, and that\u2019s your mother instinct kicking in. Listen to that. You really do need to put your foot down now, or it will get worse and you will be over run with his family. I would have a serious discussion with him that it\u2019s time to put you and the baby as his priority and stand up to his mom. Your baby is a real life person, not a toy. What she wants, simply doesn\u2019t matter. You owe her nothing.", "NTA. It\u2019s basically RSV season, the common cold for most, but for babies it can be life threatening. Your husband needs to stand up for you and his child. Sorry you are going through this. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the boundaries you set or your requests.", "A slight AH. I get that you want precautions in place and you have every right to that. You have the right to choose who is in delivery with you. After the baby is born, it's not 100 percent about you. It's called co-parenting and compromise between the two parents. Yes, you get to ensure nobody sees you until you are freshened up and you get input otherwise too...you just don't get sole dictating.", "You know you don't have to have your husband there either right? Take someone who gives a shit about you and leave him home with his mammy.

I called his mom selfish, and he said I was selfish too because the no visitors for the first day at hospital. He said I was making it about me just like she was with kissing the baby. He told me that he could leave and go live with his parents. If I just wanted to be alone and have this baby all to myself. He told me good luck getting to the hospital by myself. But I don't want him gone because I don't want to do this alone.", "I already told him my reasons, to which he said a kiss on the back of the head is not a big deal. I have told him about RSV and my cousins baby are getting nearly dying, and yet he still believes one kiss when they come to the hospital is not a big deal. His grandma also has a compromised immune system, and if we allow his mom one kiss, they will both expect more.", "I literally don't want to go into labor now and just keep the baby inside. I am so stressed because I don't feel supported or like people care about what I need. I have not been able to sleep for the past few days. I'm just thinking about how I might have zero support after the baby is here. I don't feel safe giving birth without feeling supported.", "My question here is why can't people just wait to visit after I am at least one day after giving birth to meet the baby? Is that too much to ask for? I am not asking them to stay away, just to come later, not right away after I get my guts torn and not kiss the baby for the first 3 months.", "Everyone has agreed on the pictures, and I agreed on letting immediate family come to the hospital after I am feeling better. But after everyone has met the baby, I want  to not have other people come by every day while I am recovering. What would you say it's a good time for people to come over to meet the baby after it's born? For me, I think 2 hours after is too little time for me to feel good for visitors. As for the 2 weeks that is not for meeting the baby for the first time but for spending more time with the baby after meeting it, and having everyone else come up that didn't get to meet the baby at the hospital. Also, none of his family will be vaccinated, and they think vaccines are ridiculous. So I couldn't ask them to do that, because I felt like that was going to cause more issues. I just don't understand why they can't wait till baby is 3 months and vaccinated for kisses. I already also spoke with my family about the rules, and no one had issues with them. It's not like I am picking and choosing people that can't and can do things.", "Ask him, if he just shat out a baseball, would he want to have some  time to recover and rest and deal with the pain and mess, or would he want your mother visiting right away, while he\u2019s exhausted and in pain and covered in the mess that comes from that kind of massive effort.\n\nYou\u2019re not being selfish, his mother is.  Her want to meet the baby while you and the baby are both recovering from birth are more important to him than you getting a chance to clean up and rest and get any needed medical treatment after one of the most physically demanding things the human body can do.", "Are you on good terms with your family? Because if you have family who is not emotionally abusive, then you might consider staying with them for a while. \nIf not, do you have any friends in the area who could help you? Or even not in the area, any close friends who might be willing to take you in?\n\nIf whoever can help you is out-of-state, this is actually an ideal solution because it's going to make it much harder for him to get custody.\n\nI do see a custody battle in your future, because at the moment you're married to an unrepentant momma's boy and random reddit commenters  have more concern for your baby's health than the baby's own father, \ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2e.", "He doesn't even have to agree. If he sees that it bothers you so much, it should be enough for him to stop arguing. I have to admit I'm a bit worried about what's going to happen next, because your husband doesn't support you in your decisions when you're at your most vulnerable, and I have a feeling he might give in to your MIL's wildest desires.\n\nIt's not going to be easy, but hang in there. Don't allow any kisses. Don't allow any visitors. Get help from your family if they're around. Talk to the nurses about your concerns.", "Edited = with the unvaxxed context, no. And if they're against it, then no-no. NTA to avoid baby getting sick while unprotected.\n\nBut I'm sure you guys can handle this better.

Flu, Covid etc are all needed to be done with ANY adult coming into contact with newborns), no visit!!!\n\nA friend posted last week that her newborn daughter had to be put in the NICU as someone didn't disclose that they had been ill and snuggled/kissed the baby.

Shame on you for minimizing the risks.  I assume you have never seen a baby with RSV they caught from a grandparent kissing them.", "Well said, the extra context was needed.", "Like I said on my edit, I now know she meant during unvax.
