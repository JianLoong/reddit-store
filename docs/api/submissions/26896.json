My words to him in response to the statistics would be \"You'd rather risk your baby becoming a damn statistic than say no to mommy? YOU'RE 22 YEARS OLD, YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE A FATHER. GROW THE FUCK UP.\"\n\nDon't forget that you as the mother do have the right and the ability to kick anyone you want, including him, out of the hospital room during and after labor.

Your boundaries here are very reasonable.  As far as the hospital, as the patient you can set limits on who is allowed to visit and the hospital will enforce them.

If your husband and his family can\u2019t be trusted to respect your desire to rest, recover, and bond with the baby, ask the hospital to help you, because they will.\n\nSure, it\u2019s his baby too, which is why he\u2019s allowed.  It\u2019s not his mom\u2019s baby or his grandma\u2019s baby, so they need to wait until *both* you and he are ready to have visitors.  He doesn\u2019t get to override you like that.\n\nIt\u2019ll be harder to fight him about people kissing the baby, because you won\u2019t have the hospital staff ready to defend you, but you\u2019re right there, too.  Only the people the baby lives with should be kissing them during its first month of life.  RSV is a mild cold for most adults, but it can be hospitalization or death for a newborn.  Why does your husband care more about his mommy\u2019s delicate fee-fees than he does his baby\u2019s health, maybe even its life?", "NTA\n\nYour husband should not ask you to compromise so that his mother is happy. Your husband has a duty and an obligation to ask HIS mother to make compromises so that his wife, who has just given BIRTH, is tired and discovering motherhood, is less stressed.\n\nYou need to have a serious discussion with your husband. The most important thing is not other people's feelings or whether it's \"fair\", the most important thing is your well-being. Before being the baby's room, the hospital room is YOUR room as a patient recovering from CHILDBIRTH. Your husband didn't give birth and should be your support when you're tired and at the end of your rope, not your enemy. If he isn't planning in respecting your requests, talk to the nurses and forbid visits.\n\nAnd by the way, kissing a newborn is extremely dangerous and can land him in hospital. Ever heard of RSV ? You should send a link to your husband and let him meditate, he's putting his mother's whims before his baby's health and life.", "NTA.\nIt's sucks that he cares more about his mother's feelings than the safety and wellbeing of you and your baby. \nYou should be focusing on your upcoming birth, preparing to welcome your baby, not being stressed about people crossing your valid boundaries. \nYour mother in law sounds insufferable and manipulative.", "This is not going to be a great answer. \n\nIs this your first baby? If yes, ask the same question after 2 weeks.\n\nMet someone who had the same approach. Today she regrets it, 17 years later. I'm not going to say YTA or NTA. Things will not go according to the books you're reading after baby is born. If you asked \"AITA for not wanting family to attend the birth?\" yeah, easy one. \n\nTo be fair, yes, take a few days before announcing the birth so you're not overwhelmed by people messaging you trying to visit at all hours.\n\nBut watch immediate family. Tread carefully. Been there, done that. (EDIT) Have a MIL just like yours. You will have to have a go at her without your husband around, but not right after baby's born.

However, one thing I would advise is this: don't assume that being the mother means you get final say in everything. Whether you like it or not, your husband is just as much that baby's parent as you. He gets equal say.

Tell your husband if he\u2019s not gonna respect your boundaries, then when you\u2019re discharged, you won\u2019t be going home with him. You\u2019ll be going home with your mother. Send him a video of babies with RSV. It is very real and can be very deadly. You also should tell him that people that are going to be visiting the baby need to have a current T dap shot. Yes, it is his baby too, but it\u2019s his job to put you and the baby first and deal  with his family. If he refuses to, then, as a mama, you can put your baby safety first. If he cannot respect your boundaries, that were put in place to protect your kiddo, then he can come visit you as much as he wants to at your mothers house. That will give you a safe place to recover. It\u2019s OK to have boundaries, and that\u2019s your mother instinct kicking in. Listen to that. You really do need to put your foot down now, or it will get worse and you will be over run with his family. I would have a serious discussion with him that it\u2019s time to put you and the baby as his priority and stand up to his mom. Your baby is a real life person, not a toy.

I get that you want precautions in place and you have every right to that. You have the right to choose who is in delivery with you. After the baby is born, it's not 100 percent about you.

But after everyone has met the baby, I want  to not have other people come by every day while I am recovering. What would you say it's a good time for people to come over to meet the baby after it's born? For me, I think 2 hours after is too little time for me to feel good for visitors. As for the 2 weeks that is not for meeting the baby for the first time but for spending more time with the baby after meeting it, and having everyone else come up that didn't get to meet the baby at the hospital. Also, none of his family will be vaccinated, and they think vaccines are ridiculous. So I couldn't ask them to do that, because I felt like that was going to cause more issues. I just don't understand why they can't wait till baby is 3 months and vaccinated for kisses. I already also spoke with my family about the rules, and no one had issues with them.

He can't decide that two hours will be enough for you, he's not the one pushing out a human.

And now I'm wondering if his \"research\" included babies around non-vaccinated people.   \n\n\nI mean, death is the worst that can happen, but there can also be lifelong health complications too and all the related expenses.", "That's because a hidden cold sore or an asymptomatic flu could kill the infant. The husband knows this and does not care.", "Statistically speaking, I would bet any amount of money that a household without a loving husband and grandparents that contribute to the emotional well-being of the child is far less risky than the danger of a non-exposed cold sore.\n\nYou on the other hand, are encouraging the mother to approach hospital staff with wording similar to that of a domestic violence suffer. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "He and his mommy are using you as an incubator for HER new baby. Run far, run fast, before the birth.", "I don't think he even likes her. I'm so sorry, but he probably thinks OP is just an incubator. Wth.", "I don't think he even likes her. I'm so sorry, but he probably thinks OP is just an incubator. Wth.", "Don't forget he said 2hrs is all the time she need to recover.", "I\u2019m so worried about this poor woman right now :(", "I would gladly volunteer to drive OP to her mother's home to make sure she is surrounded by the support she needs.\n\nOtherwise, she is headed towards a very stressful delivery and postpartum with this AH and his mother.", "Little extreme dont you think! Hes a mammas boy..yes, naive..sure...but abuser and controlling is a little much for whats posted.", "Our friends just had a baby, and although they haven't vocalized any rules, I'm not even comfortable going to meet baby when I haven't had my flu shot this season and they're not even a few weeks old. Babies keep - she won't spoil if I don't see her right away.", "In my family/friend group, it's typical to visit new babies at the hospital or right after they come home (everyone's fully vaccinated, washes hands, no kissing, keeps visits under 30 minutes, etc). I can imagine myself feeling disappointed if someone didn't want to do this, but I can't imagine myself arguing about it with the parents!", "Right? Tell the L and D nurse why you're alone, you'll have the most supportive care ever. Those nurses are tough as nails and protective.", "Yes, this is true. I banned my husband from every birth after the first (he was worse than useless) and had wonderful support from the nurses.", "This sounds awful, I'm sorry. I'm pregnant with our second and the only people who will be welcome in the hospital are my husband and son. Everyone else can wait and idgaf", "In my family, there is always a battalion of family members in the waiting room as soon as someone goes into labor. Out of love, but still, it's a lot. I gave birth during covid, so only my partner was allowed in the hospital. It was so nice not having to worry about entertaining other people or having privacy for medical things or while trying to nurse for the first time or wondering when they would leave and I could hold my own baby or sleep. I would honestly recommend not having visitors while in the hospital.", "It really was. Fevers in newborns can be deadly. He was lucky and it was just rhinovirus and was better in 36 hours but you can't know that until they do all the tests. He's happy as a clam now and back to normal.", "Would you rather have your child be dead? This is what's at stake. Plus, don't ever for a second think this guy will be a supportive partner and co-parent apart from this one instance. This is your hill to die on because it sets a precedent on all of your roles in the family moving forward. Budge this once, you'll be the last one to have a say in your own baby's life forever. Is your child allergic to something and grandma doesn't believe in allergies? Better kiss that baby goodbye because she will feed her whatever she sees fit regardless of what you and the pediatrician say (look up the coconut oil story here on Reddit if you don't believe me, but TW it's horrifying). You don't want to give grandma the nursing baby overnight? She may kidnap her and do as she pleases since your husband is an equal parent and he will always put her first. Maybe you don't want her baptized? She'll do it behind your back with your dear husband's help. It sucks that you only realized what kind of pathetic useless waste of space who can get someone pregnant but can't stand up to his mommy for his own child's life you married just now, but still better than finding out after they kill your child. Make no mistake MIL will never respect you in any way shape or form, all you are to her is an incubator to \"her baby\" and she's now annoyed her baby making appliance is whining an having an opinion. About your husband, I would give him ONE final warning and if he can't respect that I would leave, not allow him or any of his hooligan family anywhere near the operating room, and go the legal route, I think everywhere on the world babies of separated parents stay with the mom exclusively until they're done nursing so this is currently the one way you have to exert control on who gets close to the baby. I'm sure your family will find a way to help you even just temporarily if it means literally saving their grandkid's life, and while I'm sure it's scary to do it alone it's scarier to have your baby die. Imagine yourself picking a tiny coffin for your newborn who died because your spineless pathetic jellyfish of a husband wouldn't stop his mommy from giving her a preventable illness and I'm sure giving birth alone and asking your family for help will start to seem a lot better.", "If you're not going to stick to your rules for the first day of your child's life you're going to be in for a tough ride as a parent. If he says it's not all about you then tell him to birth the child.", "A selfish, manipulative, uncaring father is worse than no father at all. I feel for you, so much, OP, because you are in such a vulnerable position. But also because you don't yet realize how bad your husband is. I was where you are, and I just wish you would believe me and the other people who have been through this. Because then you could avoid finding out the hard way. Things will get worse after the baby is born. Your husband will be even less reasonable than he is now. Please get help.", "OP, come join us at r/JUSTNOMIL, we will support you mentally but what support do you have in person? Invtiting someone to the hospital TWO hours after the baby is born without consulting you is only something a person that really don't care about you would do. Now he threatens to leave you all together instead of supporting you and letting you have some space? YOU need to go stay with someone that is actually on your side.\n\nAlso, my dad visited when our first baby was a month old. He gave her \"baby's first cold\". I was not pleased. Then I caught it from her..\n\nWhen we had our second baby he was staying with us because I went into premature labour and we needed someone to look after big sis. When he came to the hospital with our daughter to visit us in the nicu he didn't even touch the baby. Just looked. Some people learn from the past.\n\nBut please! Find someone that will support you! Stay safe!", "OP, I know you want your husband there, but I think you ought to consider going home with your family for the birth, and possibly staying there. Unless your husband understand all this soon and acts accordingly, ***he is not a safe person for you to have around during or after the birth***. The way he is treating you is deplorable. What you are asking for is basic common sense and decency. \n\nI would set up a call with the pediatrician or your OB so that you both can talk to a medical professional about the vaccine/kissing/visitors post birth topics. If a doc can't get through to him, I think you are going to have a terrible delivery and post-birth experience.", "Your 'husband' should be doing the same as his brother did, but instead he's prioritising his own mother.\n\nGo stay with your Mom, honey. This man is not putting you or your baby's health first.", "You are not crazy, that's his mother blaming your SIL for having boundaries.  Can you call his brother and explain what's going on to get some support?", "He\u2019s told you precisely how the rest of your life with him will be. He will never choose you. He will always take his mother\u2019s side and nothing will be more important- not your health, not your child\u2019s health, not your mental health, not your happiness.\n\nThe only question here is whether you figure out you are better off without him now or after 5-10-15 years of misery. \n\nPlease go stay with your mother and stay there after you give birth.", "What is happening is that he is blindsiding you. Many men do this - they think they have a woman trapped once she has a baby. He is literally telling you what your life will be like - he is going to choose his mommy and you will be there to clean the house.", "That\u2019s because his brother loves and respects his wife and child..\nYour husband said he will always put his mother before his wife and child\u2026.why did you marry him? \nHe is in a relationship with his mother and you are the third wheel", "Leave him. Even if it's temporary. Find an apartment for yourself or ask if you can move with your parents for a little while. He is not ready to be a husband and a father. You only get one postpartum time with your first and he and his parents will ruin that for you. Yes the baby is his too but first, he's not saying things HE wants, he's saying what his mommy wants and second, during the birth and immediate post partum, EVERYTHING should go as the person giving birth prefers.\n\nIf you were earlier in your pregnancy I'd suggest you wait if he comes to his senses but you don't have time. I would ban him from delivery room and hospital because he won't be on your side when you're at your most vulnerable state. That is unforgivable.", "Then he can be divorded. Hia brother is still married, right? And he doesnt want to be lile his brother...", "H\u00e9 is probably scared shitless about becoming a parent and being responsible for a child, so is leaning in to being mummy\u2019s little trooper to comfort himself. He told you outright he picks them over you.\n\nAny option to move in with your mother for a few days to \u201crest\u201d and test his resolve on that?", "oh no. everyone should be vaccinated with TDAP to protect the baby from whooping cough. maybe use that as a compromise.  you will allow MIL to see the baby earlier than 2 weeks, if she is vaccinated with TDAP.  if your husband continues to be a jerk, i would just leave and stay at your mother's house.", "As I said you cam ask for whatever youd like.  \n\nUnvaccinated people should not be anywhere near your baby since they can be asymptotic carriers and get your child sick without knowing it.  \n\nA person carrying covid can spread it without any spit or saliva.  Unvaccinated people are a legitimate concern.   If his mom and grandma don't want to get a simple shot they shouldn't be around your newborn.  Because that is a very legitimate safety concern.  Your husband should be embarrassed and I wonder what websites he is checking that are telling him it's not dangerous for the baby. \n\nIt's not even the kissing it's just being close to a baby berating covid breath all over him or her. \n\nBut I think you're under the impression people will be coming to see you and I think they will be coming to see the baby and no one will particularly expect you to make an appearance if you're not feeling up to it.", "But why did your doctor think you weren't fertile? Why would they have checked your ovarian reserves at such a young age? Have you had cancer or similar?", "TWO HOURS. That\u2019s not even in clueless territory anymore, that\u2019s straight up malice.", "I had my husband's grandparents and brother descend on us at home a few hours after birth and ended up unconscious and Blue lighted to hospital because instead of taking it easy I was making cups of tea and serving biscuits and proving how \"natural\" I was as a wife and new mother. One post partum haemorrhage later and I remembered why mums used to be kept in hospital for days after delivery - it forced them to rest and recover!", "He literally said \u201cgood luck getting to the hospital by yourself\u201d. That\u2019s no longer a naive mamas boy.", ">This is how it starts. Separate her from ANY support system she may have, make threats, eventually control the finances. This is the beginning and I hope like hell OP can and does get out of this before it's too late. I understand she loves him and is scared, but he's showing her what her future life is going to be like. OP, NTA, and please find any way you can to get away from this.", "Little Dude is being a little extreme, don't you think?  I would call his behavior abusive even if he were merely a dick.", "'Those nurses are tough as nails and protective.'  My SIL is a very talented L & D nurse, she's this little tiny thing that looks younger than she is, sweet and kind...  but get shitty around one of her patients or argue with her?  I'm told she will protect her patients like a shark and eat you alive...  This is how those nurses need to be.", "Back then people werent such entitled assholes. These days people think its their right to turn birth into a spectator because they are such important people. And to visit right away because 'its my grand child' many people (prob coz i spend to much time on reddit) dont give a shit about the fact the poor mother just went through the most traumatic thing a woman go through. They just want to satisfy their wants coz i WANT to see the baby.", "Glad to know he\u2019s all good now :)", "Unfortunately my husband would be upset if I called his brother and wife.", ">But I think you're under the impression people will be coming to see you and I think they will be coming to see the baby and no one will particularly expect you to make an appearance if you're not feeling up to it.\n\n\n\nWho are you? \n\nEver nursed a baby? I don't believe so. \n\n@2weeks, Op and baby are still attached at the hip. \n\nNursing, crying and so many things keeps a baby within reach of their mom at that time.", "Complete speculation admittedly, but given my social circle in the medical field and just talking to folks anecdotally? \n\nA lot of people hear a doctor speculate and then just either ignore it or treat it as gospel.\n\nSo very possible OP had some sort of condition or incident that has some condition that can be associated with \u201clowered fertility.\u201d \n\nSo the doctor speculated off hand, \u201cthere\u2019s a chance you\u2019re likely less fertile, something to keep in mind in the future.\u201d something like that minus the loads of expensive tests needs to confirm that to a teenager and that was it.\n\nJust something I\u2019ve seen people do a lot", "I took 3 hours just to wake up from my emergency c-section", "My plan for the zombie apocalypse is to find the nearest delivery room and hide behind the nurses", "And who cares if he is upset? He doesn\u2019t care about you. He puts his mother before you and your child.", "Your husband is going to be upset with you even if you suddenly become perfect and bend down and listen to all of his demands, because his mother doesn\u2019t like you, and his mother is more important to him than you.\n\nYou\u2019re in a tough position, but you can\u2019t let them keep trampling your boundaries because you\u2019re not just fighting for yourself, you\u2019re fighting for the most precious person in the world, your child.\n\nInform the hospital staff that no visits should occur and all visits should be turned away, even if your husband insists. You\u2019re the patient, it\u2019s your right. Then I form your husband. If he throws a fit, ban him from the birth.\n\nIf you show him you\u2019re willing to \u2018compromise\u2019 then he will keep taking from you", "Honestly, they sound like the people who would have your back and understand what you are going through. Do what's best for you and your baby. Your husband has already made it clear that he does not have your best wishes at heart.  Your husband is going to be upset with you regardless, so what's one more little thing that may help you in the long run?", "Do you have any family or friends? Do you live in your own apartment or have your own support network?", "You are already upset.  Why are you taking care of his emotions when he doesnt care about yours?", "You are upset by your husband's demands! So why does he get to make you upset but you have to walk on eggs shells? Think this through", "So? You are upset and he has told you to your face he doesn't care.", "Who cares if he gets upset he obviously doesn't care that you're upset...", "Oh great! Then you can't say no to MIL coming and kissing your newborn! /s"]}
