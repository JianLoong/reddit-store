Not even laundry since OP does his own.\n\nEither the wife has post partum depression or just doesn't wanna do it.", "Wait, you leave at 8:45 a.m. and don't get home until 11 p.m.?

The job that\u2019s paying for her entire lifestyle to do nothing\n\n\nThis is a bigger problem than the kid not being ready on time. This is a come-to-Jesus talk time with your wife.", "NTA based on your answers. The least she can do is get the kid ready on time. It'll be worse if you get fired from your job. Maybe your kid can shower in the evening and just wash his face in the morning so it's pretty much just breakfast needing to be done (he can even eat a sandwich in the car otw to daycare).\n\nAnd you do realize this is not a sustainable arrangement, you will die with this 2-job schedule while she is mentally unwell. If she wants this to work, as a wife and mother, she needs to actively find treatment for her anxiety disorder. There's her asking for a bit of help, and there's screaming at you for you asking her to step up a bit. Big difference.\n\nWas she like this before having a child? Could it be some kind of extended PPD that got worse?\n\nDon't forget to thank MIL for helping out.", "NTA.\n\nYour wife is either depressed or extremely lazy and manipulative.\n\nGet her to go see a doctor.\n\nYou should not be working 13+ hours a day whilst she sits around doing nothing whilst child is on day care.

How long does her mother stay after dropping him off from daycare?", "Definitely NTA here. You work full days, and your wife is unemployed. I'll start by saying that the excuse of being 'overwhelmed' by keeping your child home is ridiculous. She wanted to have a child, then she needs to be a parent. Simple as that.\n\nSecondly, it's not like you're asking her to have your child ready at 4:00am. 8:45am is more than reasonable, and if she can't respect that you have a schedule and a job to be at, then she needs to give her head a shake. \n\nLastly, I understand there are legitimate reasons for people not to get their license. Specifically health reasons. But if she's avoiding it solely based on the fact that she doesn't want to, or it makes her anxious, then she needs to do a little bit of growing up here. \n\nI'm sorry if my response sounds a bit harsh, but parenting is a two-way street, and it sounds like she's not holding up her side of things.\n\nGood luck OP.

And on top of this, she can't even manage to drag herself out of bed and be ready by 8:45. The vast majority of us will be on the highway by 7:00 to go to work. \n\nPersonal advice: put your foot down that she either gets a job or becomes a sahm, so you can maybe drop a job if you have multiple or work less hours, save on daycare and maybe spend more time with your kid.

Something has to give, and your wife needs to step up and at the minimum get your child ready on time in the morning and deal with all household issues, including your laundry.  How can she be ok watching you work yourself like this and not realize it is not sustainable?  She sounds selfish.  Your wife, if not disabled or some severe issues, needs a wake up call, so keep walking out the door if he\u2019s not ready on time.

She doesn't earn money, she doesn't take care of the kid, you have to work two jobs just so that he can go to daycare so she doesn't have to deal with him, and she can't even do you the one solid of having him ready by a certain time in the morning - oh yea, she can't even take him to daycare despite not doing anything else, she pawns that off to you, too.\n\nShe doesn't even pick the kid up, her mom does!? She doesn't even do your laundry, after you come back dead tired you have to do it yourself?! What does she do?! Why are you okay with this?!

I have fucking anxiety too and I learned to deal with it because I'm not a selfish piece of poop using it as an excuse to manipulate everyone around me.\n\nYou need to have a sit down with her s t a t and tell her changes need to be made and she needs to start pulling her weight, right now she is nothing but a freeloader.

Overwhelmed moms do not have time to sit around scrolling YouTube.  \n\nPlain and simply, unless you\u2019re leaving out MAJOR parts of the story, your wife is taking advantage of you.

He immediately stopped her credit cards and started proceeding for divorce.\n\nShe got the shock of her life when the judge told her that she was not entitled to an alimony.
