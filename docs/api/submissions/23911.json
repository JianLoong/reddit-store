Bit entitled if I\u2019m honest.", "Amen - Jane needs to put up or shut up.", "I had major spinal surgery at 14. I was discharged from hospital on post op day 7. Dad drove me home as gently as possible but honestly, it was agony.", "But you would demand your friends change their holiday plans to accommodate you for an event you've had months to plan for, and didn't? You know the saying, with friends like you...", "OP, here's an idea to help your friend. Find a decent hotel and you and Jame can chip in financially. You can go on your trips and she can stay at the hotel, maybe?", "Why tf would OP and her roommates let multiple strangers live in their home for a week when no one who lives there will be home.\n\nFully not OPs problem to find a solution to.\n\nNTA", "Apparently she's known since March so had plenty of time to ask. \n\nAnd said roommate who thinks it's a big deal isn't rearranging her holiday so bit hypocritical to comment.", "As OP has already mentioned, the kind that you choose to get to improve quality of life but which isn\u2019t urgent. For example, a couple of people I know have had surgery to fuse discs in the spine. Some surgeries, no matter how much juvenile over punctuation you add, are elective and can be properly scheduled and planned.", "To me, YTA.  It's been 8 months, not 8 years and you'd still see then the visit would just be cut short.  \n\nTrue friendships aren't just for good times.  But I guess that's why so few people have them.  You have the right to be selfish but I just don't think this is a real friendship.  You're more like acquaintances.  \n\nIt's why when people say that their friends are their family I always kinds roll my eyes a little.  In my family this wouldn't even be a question.  But for \"friends\" you're loyal until there is any form of discomfort.  \n\nBut people of reddit are islands and so they will agree with you.  I just don't and I hope you never find yourself in a similar position.", "Why isn\u2019t Jane canceling her plans?", "Nta.", "As someone with an autoimmune disorder, NTA. She needs to figure her own life out and not expect others to baby her", "NTA why doesn\u2019t your roommate cancel her plans if surgery/recovery is more important.", "NTA. If friend wanted OP to care for her while she recovered, she should have coordinated dates with OP before scheduling surgery", "NTA but that statement was so harsh. And if Jane feels that someone needs to step up, it can be her. Are there no social services that can help your friend? Does she not have insurance that will help pay for a week in a hospice type residence?", "NTA but not a good friend either.", "NTA  you can't drop your plans or cut your plans short... I've had many of surgeries and had no help while I recover....", "If Jane is so caring and the surgery is more important sounds like she can cancel her plans. NTA", "Does your \u201cfriend\u201d not have any family or any other?", "NTA. this is what we call a conflicting schedule. What does one do when an appointment interferes with a conflicting appointment? you reschedule! Since she is the one that will literally be a burden on who she stays with, she should do the leg work to reschedule the surgery to a time that will be convenient to you or jane. The world does not, in fact, revolve around 1 person.", "lololol why doesnt Jane postpone her holiday? Your holiday visiting your family is equivalent to hers\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA also when you have an elective surgery and its not immediate here and now - you need to first sort out after care before accepting the date. She didn't check with you.", "NTA tell Jane to cancel her plans if she feels that strongly about her.", "NTA, she is being extremely needy, and as you said, you have your own life and commitments. You were right in what you told her.", "NTA but you could have moderated your response instead of telling her the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her. She is after all having major surgery and has other complications. However, why are her family not coming over to help? Has she considered convalescing somewhere for that week? Why is her other good friend Jane not cutting her holiday short? Lots of questions to be answered here.", "Most parents will be there immediately to help.", "Even if they did, everyone here would reassure all family members that that are in no way obligated to help out during the OPs friends recovery if it mildly inconveniences them in any way.", "I take care of my friends. If someone I loved was having surgery and needed me, I\u2019d be there for them, bc idk that\u2019s what friends fucking do. We don\u2019t know how long ago this surgery was set, what its for, or how difficult it would be to make arrangements for another one. Maybe its a fairly urgent surgery and the surgery date was set for a few weeks out. \u201cA few weeks\u201d is a completely reasonable time for surgery to be set out if its important and needs to be dealt with quickly but isn\u2019t imminently deadly.\nIt could also be that the surgeon is a specialist and a spot opened up and the next one is months or even years away. OP implies this is for a disability. If her friend was getting a boob job it\u2019d be different, but if it isn\u2019t some 100% optional surgery.\n\nOp\u2019s asking if she\u2019s the asshole and yeah sorry I think refusing to help someone youre supposed to care about who\u2019s clearly scared and in need of help when youre perfectly capable of helping makes you a shitty friend! I also think that then guilting your friends and freaking out about how youre a burden and not taking no for an answer is obnoxious.  I don\u2019t approve of OP\u2019s friend\u2019s response to rejection, its extremely childish and manipulative.", "This isn't a minor inconvenience. She had plans to travel out of town to see family.", "Honestly, I think she is an AH for just assuming that OP and roommate would be available to host and nurse her. She knew all along that she couldn't manage the financial and practical angles of the surgery without their help but she didn't make them an active part of her plans or check they would be available to help for over four months, at which point it's now too late to everyone to change plans without financial consequences.\n\nConsent and planning is important, here as with so much else. She should have asked. And if OP and roommate were willing to see to her post-op needs, then she should have worked with them as well as with her surgeon, to find a time that worked for everyone. \n\nShe has no right to guilt trip people who (in the absence of any knowledge about her needs) have made incompatible plans for that timespan and aren't available to help her. Her operation might be important, but so are other people's families and so is booked time off work.", "I don\u2019t get why the friend didn\u2019t work this out when  she scheduled the surgery? Why is the onus on this friend? She is traveling back home so does she have family? Her parents? OP is basically a child herself. Just seems like there is missing info here as to *why* OP is the only option.", "Surgery was elective, not an emergency. Scheduled in march as OP said. Friend scheduled in march assuming op wouldn't have plans but let op know just now so yeah, that's an asshole move.\n\nI do agree that you should help your friends when possible but OP's friend scheduling this *elective* surgery months in advance just assuming op would be doing nothing IS indeed a very asshole, bad friend thing to do. Had she asked and scheduled while keeping op on the loop and working it out with her, it would be different. This is something friend choose to do and expected to play the pity card way too late into the planning to make everyone cather to her", "I don't know, to be nice and help a friend?", "parents can equally hire an airbnb and care for their own daughter.\n\nshe also should have first checked availability with her friends before scheduling an elective procedure.", "After friend had 6 months to inform OP but decided on a one month notice/demand? That's not a friend I'd trust to have leeway in my home along with other strangers.", "Scheduled surgery is almost *always* scheduled months in advance. I also have an upcoming surgery that I scheduled *5 months* in advance. I feel bad for the friend but this is something that should have been worked out when she scheduled the surgery.", "Hot take YTA so is Jane how can you expect your friend to recover when she has nowhere to go she probably HAS to get this surgery soon and even if she can cancel she'd be back on a waiting list and probably have to pay to cancel you both she think about splitting her recovery time so she can get the help she needs and yall can both get family time", "If Jane thinks surgery is more important then she is welcome to cancel her plans instead. Not sure why the onus is on you instead. Unless of course Jane is being a hypocrite. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019ve given her a free place to stay. If Jane thinks it\u2019s such a priority, she can come back to help.", "Do they have rehab places where you are?  Post op patients can stay there or get homecare nurses.", "op=NTA\n\nyou didn't agree and back out last minute.  \n\nAnd your housemate(her other good friend) can cancel HER holiday to be there to care for friend if she thinks it's so important.  Why is the burden on YOU to cancel but not her?????/", "Nta why isn't Jane canceling her trip to be there for that friend. Yes surgery and recovery is important.  However it's not your responsibility.  That friend should have plan it out better so she actually had a place to stay or she could have save up gotten a hotel while she recovered. She can't just expect you to drop everything for her. Also Jane isn't being neutral.", "NTA. Sounds like you and Jane both have holiday plans. Jane said surgery is more important, so I guess she\u2019s canceling her plans to stay with the friend having surgery?", "Why not let her and a family member use your place while your gone?  When I\u2019ve scheduled a medical procedure there has been plenty of notice to find care.  If your friend can\u2019t travel or recuperate on her own the Dr should be sending her to a rehab facility, which is very common.  \nThe hospital suggested I go to rehab after my procedure but I had my partner working from home and a full bedroom/bathroom on the 1st floor of my home.", "NTA. Jane is free to cancel her plans and provide home care for your friend. You are simply not available. It sounds like you're fine with letting her stay in your home while you're away, but not available to provide her with 24/7 personal care. Perhaps she should see what kind of in home care her insurance will cover, and have an in home aid take care of her at your house. It is okay that she is scared and disappointed. But none of this is your job to fix, especially when she had months to make plans, and you have a roommate who is also not canceling their plans for her.", "NTA. Let Jane cut her holiday short.", "YTA -if you we're a friend.  \n\n\nYou're not though.  \nYou're an acquaintance.  \n\n\nIf either of you were actually friends with this person that's having surgery you'd at \\*least work out allowing her to stay to save some money.", "Agreed, as another chronically ill & disabled person. We all need support in whatever forms, but it should be given freely and consensually instead of expecting someone to drop travel plans to provide care. You were totally in the right to tell your friend that your life can\u2019t revolve around her priorities, and of Jane can\u2019t see that she sounds like she\u2019s willing to cancel her plans to help! NTA.", "I had a small surgery in my knee and went to school by public transport 6 days post-op (made sure online was also an option). It was already a pain in the ass. Can't imagine doing that after a spinal surgery! You are even more limited then very very likely, not even speaking about the pain. And public transport isn't the most friendly for people who aren't mobile yet. Busy, you have to get in and out on time etc. \n\nNTA OP. It is not your fault that she planned very poorly. It sucks but she should've told it earlier.", "Also, when patients don't have help at home and cannot be on their feet when discharged, the hospital case management would discuss the options and arrange a rehab placement at least in the US. Idk where OP and her friend live, but the friend should speak to the hospital regarding the post-op rehabilitation process instead of trying to force OP to change her plan.", "Won't help as she needs someone to help her out and care for her but op is NTA.\n\nAlso agree if Jane considers this do important she can cancel her vacation.", "She needs to talk to her doctors about rehab. After  major spine surgery, everyone should get rehab to learn to move and care for themselves again. In which part of the world are you? How is health insurance in your country? In a european country with a robust social safety net, she would go to rehab or get a home nurse for the time."]}
