You can be both kind, compassionate and as well as clear about what is doable or not for you. Enjoy your time with your family.", "NTA.

But you\u2019re also not required to help her after surgery if you\u2019re not comfortable with this.

This sort of major surgery sounds like she will need much more than just a place to stay. Help with washing, toileting, probably can't cope on her own, so OP would need to take time off work.

Your life doesn\u2019t not and should not revolve around her. Is she your child? Is she your employer? No. You are kindly doing her a favour.

She has major spine and leg problems. This isn't a 'fun' surgery like plastic surgery for example. \n\nTo my knowledge, she's known about the date since March but didn't ask me about staying at ours.", "What if they don\u2019t have the money to do that?

You have complete right to be in charge of your plans, especially concerning family. And she doesn\u2019t have many open options, being disabled and in need of the surgery to which she must be accommodated with, it\u2019s normal she\u2019ll be needing desperate help.

She had enough time to notify you or Jane about her needs. Slinging it last minute and expecting people to drop everything for her is wrong considering everyone has different life experiences and directions.\nI am sympathetic towards her plight but she had enough time to make plans or ask for help and it could have been an entirely different story if she simply had done so.", "You should be very no-nonsense with her: \"You could have asked me in March.  The answer is NO.\"  Take a similar approach with Jane.\n\nSomeone else mentioned that they think Jane does this intentionally (not asking about accommodation well in advance); I agree.  That's even more reason not to give in.", "That is so much time to schedule in advance. That is fully a her problem at this stage", "Surgery is sort of a big deal. Even the housemate said that.

ESH.\n\nCan your friend change her surgery, such as delay it until one of you is back? Has she asked other friends? Can Jane return early? \n\nChange you make your visit a little earlier, so you can come back early? \n\nCan friends pool resources to get her taxi / ambulance ride home? Or pay for part of a hotel stay?\n\nThere are all sorts of ways to solve this & it sounds like the friend group isn't communicating well.

And I'm appalled that you roommate found it appropriate to chastise you.", "NTA but your friends sure are! It\u2019s not your responsibility or requirement to care for your friend, prior to scheduling surgery she should have considered all the recovery factors and the fact she expects other people to just show up and care for her is ridiculous and I say this as a blind woman with multiple health issues and having had complex medical procedures, it\u2019s the person with the health issues responsibility to make sure post surgical care and recovery will go well, she\u2019s not entitled to anyone\u2019s time or assistance.\n\nSecondly Neutral Jane can cancel her plans and stay home and be caretaker if she feels that strongly about it. Don\u2019t cancel your plans, go visit your family you are NTA here", "NTA\n\nAs an ALTERNATIVE plan:\n\nYou can still offer your place to her. \n\nWith the money saved from the hotel, she can bring one of her family members to accompany her to the hospital and care for her for a week.\n\nIt's more the responsibility of the family than you. \n\nDon't let her guilt you.\n\nGood luck!", "ESH\n\nI personally wouldn\u2019t ask a friend to cut their vacation short to see family unless i really, really needed them. Just recentlyI had a surgery for the first time and the pain was extreme, for a fairly non invasive surgery.\n\nHere is what your friend is going to go through: she\u2019s going to be extremely anxious leading up to her surgery since she doesn\u2019t know where she\u2019s going to be going, which can lead to complications w/ nausea after surgery. She\u2019ll be alone, trying to feed and take care of herself whole in incredible pain. Post operative depression is intense. I was briefly suicidal a few days after surgery. \n\nSurgery is an extremely physically intense experience and its horrible to go through with support, let alone by yourself. \n\nYou\u2019re either ignorant or an awful friend. You\u2019ll still be seeing your family, and I know it sucks, but she\u2019s going to be going through what could very well be the worst experience of her life. Your housemate could have canceled plans too.  \n\nHer behavior is childish from the way you describe it but sheesh dude", ">Help with washing, toileting, probably can't cope on her own, so OP would need to take time off work.\n\nPretty much. She would spend a few days in hospital before coming back to stay with me (if I agreed to take care of her)", "That's a great idea. I'll suggest it. \n\nJane and I don't mind her staying at our place but neither of us can be there which defeats the purpose, you know?", "Sounds like your friend needs to consider entering a rehab facility or care home for a bit.", "It\u2019s elective, planned surgery. People schedule those things. If you expect someone else to accommodate you, then you schedule with that person."]}
