She cooks for us and if she doesn't want to we all go out to eat or make food for her instead. We're not treating her like a cook or anything so don't worry. I wasn't asking her to make food especially for my friend, just a little extra from what she makes for me. still, not having to pack food for two would give her a few extra minutes of no work. I have shared this with mom and she still doesn't mind making extra food. I just didn't feel like it was fair to her if someone's not grateful for what she's doing even if it isn't that big.", "created_utc": 1687259629, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14e8ad4/wibta_if_i_stop_bringing_home_cooked_meal_for_a/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I was in your position I would also stop, they seem to be taking your offer for granted. Saying thank you is basic manners.\n\nBut I\u2019d first explain it to your friend that you\u2019re stopping and why (e.g via text the night before). It mitigate any excess annoyance they may have if they expect food and don\u2019t receive any.", "NTA... that's rude and disrespectful", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like your friend doesn't appreciate you bringing her food. Maybe she thinks that getting her food is no extra trouble for you at all, she is certainly acting that way. The best thing to do in this sort of situation is to let her know that you're going to stop bringing food and why. \n\nShe might well say, 'that's fine, I can sort my own food easily.' If she has a change of heart and is genuinely sorry, says she thought it was no trouble for you at all, and she'll really try to be more appreciative and it seems genuine, she's offering to do you loads of favours etc, then it might make sense to keep giving her food. However this seems unlikely based on how she's been so far.\n\nWhat is more likely is that she will say that it's not fair that you're cutting her off when it's no trouble for you anyway and that you're being a bad friend/petty. This is a sign that she was probably just using you as a meal delivery service rather than a friend.", "NTA, OP she threw away your food and your answer is to bring more??? Please grow a backbone..", "That is not your friend and you are NTA. Stop bringing food, just tell her your mom is cooking only for you.\n\n\n\n\nWhen I was in a high school I have this classmate who happens to be my roommate in my hostel. We aren't exactly friends but.... Her parents never sends her pocket money except for the school fees and hostel mess fees. She never can afford outside food, where as my mother always sends money every 2 weeks and I have my oldest brother live 5 minutes walking distance (our parents live in a different town). One day she came back with other hostelers and enters the room laughing, I asked wanting to join the laugh. She said she laughed because she went with other girls and had a nice meal and thought about me, I was like: ('teary eyed) \"oh you remember me? \" she is like \"no idiot, I was laughing because you will be eating your regular snacks while I enjoy a tasty meal\". That was the last time I share any snacks I get from home, my brother's place and from outside. Let her eat the stale hostel food!\n\n\n\nAlso she would use my shampoo without my knowledge and pour water in it. On the day of graduation, I went out to celebrate with few of my friends and when I return in the evening I was told she has left the hostel earlier as her older brother came to pick her up. Couple of days later my mother came to pick me up. While packing I realised, my bag, few books (novels, comic books & world map book), few jeans and some tshirt were missing lol! I remembered the time when other girls telling me about losing their money whenever she goes to chit chat with them in their room.\n\n\n\nPeople who shows no gratitude is something we need to be beware of...", "NTA, bottom line here is your friend is not only behaving rudely, but also acting entitled.  This doesn't have to be a confrontation, simply stop feeding her and if she inquires simply tell her, she doesn't appreciate.  It's not like she will starve.  Most who have been to Uni have had to deal with cafeteria, mass quantity produced food.  If nothing else you may be teaching her to be a bit less rude and more appreciative in the future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Plus why is your mom making it and not you?  I think that is kinda a little AH-ish", "NTA. She's being disrespectful and taking advantage of your kindness. Sit down and talk to her, and tell her how it made you feel that she threw away the food your mom took the time to make. Give her one more chance. Let her know that if she does it again, the gravy train isn't coming around anymore. Also let her know that it's rude to repeatedly not show appreciation when someone does you a favor. You are under no obligation to bring her any food; you're doing it as a friend.", "NTA", "NtA. Stop bringing free home made food to your ungrateful friend. You should ask yourself if she really is a friend or just using you", "Almost exactly this happened to me. I was bringing cooked food to a friend who at the time was in a situation of having little time to cook for herself. One day after bringing something that had been costly for me to make, I caught sight of her giving it to the guy who had been fixing a new door in her property. She didn't see me passing by. I felt so taken for granted. I immediately stopped, and never did it again. The feeling of disrespect stung.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You don't even have to have a special conversation about it.  Just stop bringing her food.  If she cares enough to say something, then you can let her know that she was sending out unappreciative vibes and you didn't want to keep bringing her an unwanted gift.  If she apologizes profusely, then she is perhaps worth keeping as a friend. But if she gives you attitude, it really isn't worth it. Drop her and keep it moving. \n\nBut going forward, try to be more judicious with your generosity.  Like, I am not going to bring someone food every day unless they are matching that kind of energy. And I am having a hard time coming up with an \"energy match\" for a daily meal service.  Bring her food once a week, tops.  It is easier to show gratitude for an occasional thing than a daily thing. (It is also easy to get tired of a daily thing than an occasional thing.)", "NTA, and it has to be said:\n\n> The thing is she is never grateful or has even said a thank you to me ever which I let slide since we're friends.\n\nThat's not how a friend acts at all.

I have to rush to college in the morning and come late so don't find time to cook.", "I love how you've said it. Thank you!", "I would. Like.every.single.day.
