She desperately texted asking to stay in my tiny 1 bedroom apartment for 3 weeks. For context, I haven't talked to this girl for 15+ years, but our moms are besties of 40+ years. Our moms were bridesmaids, helped each other thru family death, etc. Because of this, I felt a lot of pressure into saying yes to letting her stay.\n\nThe daughter, as I learned, is a bratty spoiled 23 year old who expects people to do everything for her for free while she spends her parents' money on $900 shoes and $1000+ designer homeware.\n\nRed flag #1: After I agreed to let her stay, I proceeded to ask her on the details of her arrival, assuming she would be considerate enough to give advanced notice. Turns out, she only gave me literally TWO DAYS of notice of her 3 week stay.\n\nRed flag #2-6: She then proceeded to freeload off of me for almost an entire month, living entirely for free in my apartment. She did not offer to cover any apartment costs.She threw away my food from the counter.Broke items including my travel memorabilia- Left moldy food on my dining table. \n\n\\- lost my spare house key within 5 hours of her arrival, then asked to take MY PERSONAL key to get in/out of the apartment. I had to spend an evening running around home depot and locksmiths.-\n\n Red flag #7: The falling out. The falling out came with a weekend getaway to Maine I planned for my own vacation. When she asked my weekend plans, I mentioned the trip. She then invited herself to \"tag along\" (which for her I guess means free).- I paid for the rental car, the hotel, the gas money, the national park entry fees, and drove the entire trip (\\~12 hours of driving in total).- When it came time to pay for gas or any shared trip costs, she turned the other way. But then I watched her buy a $40 dollar disposable camera, $8 lattes, and other exorbitant things for herself.- \n\nAfter the trip ended, I split the trip cost in half ($200 each) and told her she can pay me back when able. She got mad and gaslit me. Saying she didn't think she would have to split costs, that she is \"not in a position\" to split, and that she contributed \"in small ways\" (ie paying a 4 dollar parking pass and 1 coffee).\n\nI let out all my frustrations and ended by calling her a freeloader. She left the apartment angry and got her parents to book her a hotel room. Moms are super mad and their friendship is now quite tense.- From my end, maybe I should have communicated problems from red flag #1, said no more, or been explicit about trip costs? I was trying to avoid conflict and never thought someone would be bratty enough to freeload my vacation.

You rightly called them out and have absolutely NOTHING to apologize for. And if the moms\u2019 friendship is ruined over this, then it was superficial anyways.", "NTA. But this daughter is being enabled by her mom, and it sounds like they were looking to you to help with that. \n\nMy guess is that she thought that because you were paying the roadtrip costs anyways, you shouldn\u2019t have asked her for her share.  The roadtrip might be the breaking point, but you were in the right to evict her because she\u2019s a rude houseguest that\u2019s not respectful of your space.", "NTA. Holy crap, what *terrible* behavior. You had every right to call her out . I mean, you could have told her about the problems ahead of time and mentioned the trip costs, but I get the distaste for confrontation and finding it hard to wrap your head around that someone could be **so** oblivious to the appropriate ways to behave when you are staying in someone else's home. Her mom should totally pay you all that daughter owes you for essentially taking care of her daughter for three weeks.", "NTA. \"Hi mom. I know you're hurt that I'm not getting along with daughter. I have already spent $xxxx on her, she is rude, she has ruined my belongings, and she honestly doesn't seem to have grasped the concept that she has to look after herself. I put up with her as long as I did as a favour to *you*. All I asked is that she pay for her part of the trip that she invited herself on. She told me that her buying coffee once made up for everything I spent on her and it was the absolute last straw. I didn't kick her out, she left because she didn't want to hear the truth, that I wasn't subsidising her living expenses anymore, and that her lack of planning and consideration were not my problem. I know it must be hard for things to be tense with your bestie, and I'm sorry you're having a hard time. But I am *not* sorry for telling her the truth, and I'm not sorry she left.\"", "NTA. You shouldn't have let her tag along on the trip. Yet I wonder what godawful mess you'd have come back home to \n\nMaybe it would do well to show her this post and see why yall fell out. If Mom doesn't get it after this, something's wrong", "NTA Though you could have handled it a bit better. You did have to put up with a lot though so honestly she just sucks. Some parents need to teach though. This is seriously horrible behavior.", "NTA\n\nBut I think it's better to eat the cost of the trip rather than if you had left  her alone in your apartment. You would have probably came home to an even bigger problem.", "She\u2019s the AH, but as to your questions, yes, it\u2019s best to speak up sooner. At the very least, it\u2019s best to be clear on things involving money before you agree to take them on. I\u2019m surprised that you did it once (when she moved it) and then immediately again when she invited herself along to your vacation.", "NTA.", "ESH. She does suck, but in any situation where you expect to be paid you should communicate those expectations upfront.\n\nIf you had communicated your issues to her earlier, perhaps she would have moved into a hotel sooner.", "ESH you have a mouth, use it. Why did you let her crash yr vacay?  Shared costs hv to be discussed prior to event. The only reason I can see you let her come with is she would have trashed yr house if you left her there alone.", "Trying to avoid conflict by not telling her the truth about her being a nuisance and being indirect about costs is kind of manipulative. You made nice and went along until you couldn\u2019t anymore. Did you think she would magically read your mind and know when you felt used or disregarded?      \nESH.    \nI think obviously the girl who stayed with you is awful but truly you have ownership over letting her use you and then getting mad about it only down the line. This could have been prevented. Why you would let her muscle in on this whole trip with not one convo about money or boundaries is beyond me.", "ESY. Very bad communication from all sides.", "YTA for letting her take advantage of you.", ">her new job was starting 3 weeks before her lease.

She was getting so desperate that she reached out to a family friend she hadn't seen in 15 years because she was running out of time.

Personally, I don't expect my guests who are in between homes to cover any additional expenses. If that's something you wanted her to do, you need to have communicated that.\n\n>After the trip ended, I split the trip cost ($200 each) and told her she can pay me back when able.\n\nYou can't just decide after the fact to bill her when that was never discussed and expect that to work out for you.\n\n>When asked to pay her half, she got mad and gaslit me. Saying she didn't think she would have to split costs, that she is \"not in a position\" to split, and that she contributed \"in small ways\" (ie paying a 4 dollar parking pass and 1 coffee).\n\nThis is not gaslighting. It's true that she didn't think she would have to spilt costs because you never told her she would have to. You can't just demand money from people. You should have had a conversation with her before anything else and come to an agreement as to what she'd be comfortable covering financially.\n\nEverything else you mention just says that she's young, clumsy, and not a mind reader. You failed to communicate in any way the entire time she was staying with you, so she was never given a chance to change the behaviour you weren't liking. You sound incredibly judgemental and, while a little bit of frustration was probably warranted here, you've taken well beyond what was necessary.\n\nESH mostly you tho", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

One of the beautiful parts of aging is your patience for crap becomes shorter and you cut it short a lot sooner than you did when you were younger.

The minute she started acting entitled, she should have received the warning of what the consequences would be if she didn\u2019t shape up immediately, and then when she didn\u2019t change, you should have supervised her packing to leave.\n\nChange your locks, my friend.", "NTA, send her mother a bill for all she broke, the key, the trip and the difference in your utilities.", "Avoid conflict?
