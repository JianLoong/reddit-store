She just invited them without asking. So I am planning a party for my kiddo. We have rented out the whole venue because last year we had issues with random kids we didn't know coming in and taking things. So I send out Facebook invites and make a post asking for how many children will participate in the activity because the venue requires a guest list and even though we are renting the whole thing there is a limit on how many people you can have. Well said friend comments saying she's bringing 2 kids plus nephew. I sent her a message explaining that before an extras were added, I had to see how many classmates and family were coming to make sure there was room. Also, last year, 2 children with medical needs were dropped off at her party with no adults, and I had no clue of their medical needs. Okay, so 2 weeks go by, and her 2 children and extra child turn into 2 kids and 2 nephews. I once again reminded her we had to see how many of her family and classmates were coming because her party is about her and who she wants to invite since it's her big day. We'll here we are close to the party and the 2 kids and 2 extras turn into 2 kids and 3 nephews. I tell her that we are at our limit and we don't have room for the 3 extras. She says well I won't be coming because it's not fair to bring 2 and not the others and i said i understand. I'm not going to lie I'm a bit irritated because she's my \"best\" friend and she's known about this party for over a month, so why continue to volunteer to babysit kids knowing I said you had to wait. Am I the a$$hole for telling her that she can't bring the extra kids? I feel horrible about it but I'd rather my daughters friends be there instead of 3 kids we've never met.", "created_utc": 1675293910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10r9qyu/aita_for_telling_a_friend_she_cant_bring_extras/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I guess the main issue is how to (ideally politely) communicate this to her and then come up with a plan on what to do when she shows up with 7 kids anyway. But you\u2019re not an asshole for not allowing uninvited guests to come.", "If your daughter has never even met these kids you are NTA.  Why does your friend think that she can bring random kids to your child\u2019s party?", "NTA. You should have told her right off the bat that you didn\u2019t have room for extra kids though, rather than being passive aggressive and hoping she would just realize she was being rude. But you\u2019re absolutely not an AH for expecting a grown up to understand how party invitations work and that she can\u2019t just add uninvited guests to an RSVP.", "NTA, she is.  You need to look for more friends.", "NTA she is though since you told her you were not sure if there was going to be any extra room. And it\u2019s not her party to invite them too.", "NTA. It's your kid's party, not hers. She has not right to invite other kids without your consent. Wtf. Is she paying for the party? No. Is the party for one of her kids? No. So if she doesn't want to attend, that's okay but she shouldn't feel betrayed because you said no.", "NTA. You tried to tell her and she didn\u2019t want to hear it.", "NTA. \n\nThis is your child's party and she doesn't know these people. It's inappropriate to keep adding more bodies as well. I think you were fine to tell your friend it won't work out. Especially if you are providing cake and other things for the kids. Limiting it to your child's friends and classmates seems utterly reasonable to me.", "Entitled is as entitled does, drop her from the circle NTA", "NTA\n\nI've had this issue before too with some relative bringing in some random kids (neighbors of hers) to a kids party with the justification that \"It'll be more fun with more kids.\". Dumbass didn't consider that the food ordered is limited, that's why we had to order fast food just to get everyone fed. She didn't see anything wrong with what she did even after being scolded by every adult in that party.\n\nIf there's a guest limit, it's courtesy to bring only the ones invited. That's basic.", "NTA. \n\nLet her know that she can invite the extra children as long as she covers their expenses. See how quickly her tune changes.", "Nta, tell the friend that they could carry the nephews out somewhere fun after the party.", "NTA. If they\u2019re not invited, they don\u2019t get to come, simple as that. Even kids understand that concept.", "NTA, common kids party protocol is not to bring extras without permission, and even then it's only ever siblings.\n\nShe was being inconsiderate as you said there was a limit which she completely ignored.", "NTA. It is rude to invite \u2018extras\u2019 to any party that you are not paying for. You told her No, don\u2019t give into her guilt trip of you, if it was me I would\u2019ve said No from the start.", "NTA but you are deluding yourself to call this person your best friend. You set a boundary and she breached it not once, not even twice but three times. Just say you'll miss seeing her there.\nIt's daughter party for her to enjoy with her friends Not a free activity for your friend and her extended family.", "NTA not even a little bit. Your friend is definitely an entitled AH. Your better off she didn\u2019t come", "NTA. Don't say anything. Let her not be invited. If she just shows up, tell her you don't have room for her kids anymore since you filled in with other people (even if it's a lie).", "NTA. Very audacious to keep adding random kids you do t know to your child\u2019s party. If she can\u2019t respect your request, disinvite her.", "NTA but you should have honestly said no right from the start, the budget is controlled by invited kids only.", "NTA", "NTA. You have nothing to feel bad about. This friend knew only one was invited and you likely wouldn't have room for another two, much less three. Consequences are hers.", "Maybe it's just because I was a kid at birthday parties before, but it seems like they've gotten a lot more complicated since I was a kid.", "NTA  you said don't bring them and she's not, leave it at that. Some people just don't get it.", "You're NTA. She was using your kid's party for her babysitting duties and repeatedly ignored you telling her the extra kids were not invited.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Isn\u2019t no a complete sentence?", "If their name isn't on the list they won't be allowed to come inside", "the answer is tell her promptly, tell her limit on guess.", "This is what I don't understand. I don't mind if they have a sibling that wants to come but I was always taught you don't just bring kids to a party. When I was growing up my parents didn't even bring my sister unless it was stated siblings welcome", "I was okay with the 1 nephew if we had room but after inviting friends and family once everyone responded we didn't have room.", "I definitely agree to needing more friends.", "I honestly don't know where people get the audacity to expect the things they expect from other people. It makes me sad that they cause good people like you question your motives", "That's why I've put it in quotes. Because there's been more than this lately that's made me question our \"frienship\"", "That\u2019s still the way it works around here. If the child isn\u2019t invited by name or included through a clear \u201csiblings welcome\u201d statement, then they aren\u2019t invited and it\u2019s not cool to bring them. And as the kids are getting toward the end of elementary school, even parents staying is now rude unless WE\u2019RE invited. People aren\u2019t buying food for anyone who feels like they\u2019re entitled to it.", "Are these kids staying with her currently and she is responsible for them that day? Or is she planning to collect them on the way to your child's party?", "I totally understand, but she took advantage of your kindness. Lots of people will.", "Sorry to hear that. Hope you find more and better friends soon.", "OP mentioned that she was \"babysitting\" the kids so my guess was that she was collecting payment for watching kids she figured she could just shovel off into OP's party.", "She's not being paid. But she's watching them so mom can go live it up", "She can send her kids to the party and babysit her nephews separately.", "It is payment. Whether it\u2019s money or getting her kids babysat in the future, there is some form of trade. She\u2019s just outsourcing that work to you.", "NTA \n\nShe got two invites for her children.  It\u2019s not your fault she thought she could weasel in three more kids", "NTA.your friend is rude and entitled. Her kids were invited not her nephews", "NTA, just tell her only invited kids are ya know, invited!!", "doesn\u2019t matter whether OP\u2019s daughter has met the nephews or not, OP is NTA either way.", "Family of 5 kids. I didn't go to my older sisters parties or my brothers or little sisters. The other sister is my twin, but we didn't always go to the same friends house. It's weird that she brings the other kids.", "Is she caring for the kids due to a difficult family situation? (Ie, sick parent and shes doing free respite care)\n\nOr is she just wanting to bring extra kids because its easy?\n\nId handle those two very different ways. But either way, you need to have an actual direct conversation about how many kids the venue allows, and that her asking to bring nephews means 3 **invited** kids would have to miss out."]}
