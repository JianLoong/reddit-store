Even how close you are/were to her makes no difference.  She said don\u2019t come to her work. You went to her work. You could have called. Texted. Or just let her figure it out like adults do.

I'm sure you were trying to do something nice by taking her lunch to her, but you should have texted or called her first to see if it was okay since she doesn't want visitors at work. By going in anyways, even if you were just trying to be helpful, you violated her boundaries and you should apologize for that.", "A soft ESH. I don\u2019t know what your sister does for work, but she doesn\u2019t want you to visit (which you knew), so you probably shouldn\u2019t have just shown up (maybe text/call her first to see if she wanted you to drop it off), especially since she has told you not to visit before.
