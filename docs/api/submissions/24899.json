What the hell kind of clown would expect you to pay for something you didn\u2019t do?", "NTA. It's nuts to expect you to pay half for what she ate. That's not how it works.", "NTA.

She wanted to eat and you gave up your preference of a sunset walk to accommodate her. She then proceeded to order $50 worth of food and wine while not showing the slightest concern that you aren't having any at all.\n\nFrom the fact that she was already acting like she was out of your league and getting on her phone, she 100% wasn't vibing either and just wanted a subsidised meal. Good for you for not falling for it!", "NTA.\n\nBut you're a champ for sticking it out.", "NTA - It's strange that she still wanted to sit and eat after you said you weren't hungry. That already seems awkward. But no, you are not in the wrong.", "NTA.\n\nThe one invited to eat out should not be expected to pay more than their own meal.\n\n(In certain cases I might even say that whoever invites the other to a specific restaurant should foot most if not all the bill. But that's irrelevant rn.)", "NTA - You shouldn't have to pay her bill.\n\nHowever, that situation sounds awkward and uncomfortable. It is kind of odd that you just sat there and watched her eat. You couldn't order a diet coke or something?", "NTA at all", "NTA at all.  She should have never expected you to.", "bro what did she order? lobster and vintage wine?? FIFTY DOLLARS. for dinner and wine. omfgggg\n\nNTA", "WHAT?! Absolutely nta. Why would you even consider you were?! OP you are doing fine and did great in parting ways. She can kick rocks.. at the beach, alone.", "Definitely NTA we've all been there before at some point. Best to count it as a lesson learned and look for a woman who's genuine.", "NTA. It was her idea to eat and you just sat there drinking water. Why would you pay for her meal when the two of you weren\u2019t even getting along anyway?", "NTA.  You didn\u2019t eat.", "NTA and be glad you found out that she is an entitled jerk early on before you caught real feelings (or got suckered into paying for her crap).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
