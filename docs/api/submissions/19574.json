Have been seeing a girl for about 4 weeks (not serious I know) everything has been going great, we have great sex, we communicate really well, we have strong feelings for each other but last night she started saying some things about my brother that I just do not like. She had told me that she was busy this whole week and that the only days I could see her were Wednesday and Saturday as she has lots of work to do, no issues what so ever, we see each other when we see each other, so I booked with my brother to go over to his and help him build a barbecue, as I\u2019m getting ready to leave my house to drive over to his, she texts me saying that she is on her way over because she\u2019s horny and wants sex, completely out of the blue, as far as I\u2019m aware she was working, so I said \u2018I\u2019m really sorry but I\u2019ve booked in to help my brother with something\u2019 (for context, my brother has helped me through a lot of stuff and without him I probably would be living on the streets, he set me up for a couple of months after I broke up with my ex and had no where to live) she then responds with \u2018okay \ud83d\ude14\u2019 which is fine, she\u2019s bound to be a little upset as she isn\u2019t able to see me. Skip to yesterday, we were at a family meal  (she was invited but didn\u2019t want to go as she had work to catch up on, again no issues with that) told her I would see her in the evening as this was a lunch time meal and we were done by 4pm. After the meal my family headed over to my mums house to relax and catch up properly, my brother noticed he had a nail sticking out the side of his tyre and needed to change to his spare (he\u2019s never had a flat tyre before so has never had to change one) so I helped him. Fixed the tyre no problems. Headed home to get my stuff ready to leave to go see her, mentioned that I needed to shower as I had just got a tyre for my brother. She then says \u2018your brother is a grown adult and should know how to fit a tyre, that is ridiculous, how fucking dumb\u2019 so i played it off as a joke as I was angry that she was talking about my brother/best friend this way and felt the conversation would be better in person rest her than over text. \u2018She then kicked off saying that I shouldn\u2019t have played off her feelings and that she is worried that our relationship is going to be affected by his serious lack of life skills\u2019 and goes in to a full blown rant on how dumb he is and that I\u2019m going to prioritise family over her, naturally I agree as the relationship is very new and I have no way of knowing where it will go and my brother has helped me through everything in the past. Long story, short. She wants a couple of days to calm down and we can talk again afterwards, am I the asshole?\n\n\nUPDATE: that was the easiest break up of my life. 0 fucks given on either side \ud83d\udc4d", "created_utc": 1686501146, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146ycua/aita_gf_has_insulted_my_brother/", "score": 93, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
