You did nothing wrong. Your friend sounds like she is insecure and doesnt have a lot of confidence. On the top of that, she projects her own insecurities by being mean to people and calling them ugly\n There are some deeper issues she needs to work on and that are not gonna be fixed at the gym", "NTA. What was her goal with that lie? She wanted you to pretend or go along, while also being cruel to your other friend. The truth always comes out one way or another.", "NTA. I was going to say you shouldn\u2019t have called her out since it\u2019s basically harmless, but she straight up called Eva ugly, which is totally unacceptable. Heidi sounds very insecure, but you just cannot do that and she needs to expect repercussions for being an asshole like that.", "Question: Why are you friends with this person?", "NTA It\u2019s sad Heidi feels the need to lie about men liking her, I guess it\u2019s because the reality is they don\u2019t. Sounds like she\u2019s living in a fantasy world. Why are you hanging round with someone who talks constant BS?", "NTA\n\nHeidi has self image problems and is forcing people to believe it though you know it's nonexistent. You were quiet when it didn't really hurt anyone but stopped her runaway train when she tried to tie Eva to her tracks.  Good on you for putting a stop to that.", "NTA. Kudos to you for supporting Eva and shutting the behaviour down.", "She recently lost weight from 300 to 250\u2026lmao. Good for her but yea she\u2019s just crazy insecure. People that have trouble romantically often make the biggest deals out of it.\n\nWow just saw her call Eva ugly too. Why are any of you friends with her.", "INFO - why is Heidi part of the group at all if that\u2019s how they are acting? \n\nLearn to cut those people off.
