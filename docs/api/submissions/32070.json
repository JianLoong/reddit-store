It was the first time Tina came to stay with us over Thanksgiving. \n\nI get that there is some class difference. Tina worked mainly in restaurant and retail jobs to make ends meet. My mom is an engineer and my dad is a lawyer. \n\nTina stayed on our couch and immediately tried to make me into this thrifty housewife for her son although I\u2019m currently making more than him as he\u2019s finishing his post grad internship.  \n\nIt became hostile about things like our hand soap in the bathroom. Kitchen towels and trash bags. We got into a major fight over them. I normally just use the trash bags that originally came with our trash can. \n\nI never really paid attention to the price but after we got back from grocery shopping and I didn't get stove top stuffing or mashed potatoes she was mad at me. She didn't like the grocery store I chose to get our mini Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nWe went to our loft and she started yelling at me about how I didn't need to shop the way I do and that I needed to wise up money wise and not waste her son\u2019s money. Again I make 6 figures while her son is wrapping up his internship but after that, he should match or exceed my pay in two years so the price of milk and trash bags is not something I think of. \n\nI told her that. I don't know what happened but she starts crying saying about how horrible I am. I got angry at her and left her in the loft and texted Matt about her. I went to stay with my sister and her girlfriend who lives on the other side of the city overnight. They were planning to come to our mini Thanksgiving (this is Wednesday night) Matt asked if we could now skip hosting because his mom is not in a good place and I upset her. They ended up eating the turkey I was going to prepare and then made Matt rush to get stovetop stuffing and instant potatoes. He dropped  overnight bag off at my sister's. Normally Matt and my sister have a good relationship but she yelled at him. \n\nHis mom left but Matt thinks we should discuss finances. My whole family heard about what happened over trash bags and Matt canceling Thanksgiving. My family is angry at him and his mom. My mom thinks I should cancel the engagement but Matt and his mom think I\u2019m awful for just leaving his mom crying in the apartment and I acted like a \u201csnobby diva\u201d to her.", "created_utc": 1701368486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187p8w0/aita_for_saying_i_dont_need_to_be_thrifty/", "score": 1317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he won't...you have a fiance problem, not a MiL problem.\n\nShe berated and belittled you in your own home because she *didn't like the grocery store you went to* to shop for the Thanksgiving *you and Matt* were hosting, at which she was a *guest*, and then got upset that you didn't console her *after she picked a fight and berated you*. Your fiance took her side, cancelled Thanksgiving for your family, and ate the food you bought and were going to prepare with his mom. Because you \"upset her\"-- nevermind that she started it and she upset you! In your house!\n\nIf she wanted specifically Stovetop stuffing and mashed potatoes, she could have gone to a different store to buy them, asked you if the two of you could go to a store that had them after you finished the other shopping, or texted Matt to ask him to pick them up. She instead started criticizing and berating you because she wanted to go to a different grocery store than the one you were shopping at, and in the process indicated that she doesn't respect you, doesn't understand or doesn't believe that you are the primary breadwinner right now or that you could ever earn your own money, and that she will always see you as inadequate and a drain on \"her son's money\" and she'll cover for that by calling you a snob and saying *you* upset *her.* And it works on your fiance. They both owe you serious apologies, but man...is he worth it?", "Matt\u2019s mother went from giving unsolicited and unwanted opinions to then escalate to full blown completely inappropriate behavior.\n\nWhatever she\u2019s dealing with, has nothing to do with your choice of trash bags and mashed potatoes.\n\nWhat\u2019s disconcerting is that she think\u2019s you\u2019re living off her son and that she\u2019s within her rights to treat you with contemptuous disrespect - and Matt did nothing to stop the misconceptions or behavior. She has shown you who she is and Matt\u2019s reaction to this situation is problematic. Your parents are right. YWNBTA", "I think it is important that she complained about how you \"waste\" her son's money. This implies either that Matt has given her the wrong impression about your respective salaries, or that she has a funny attitude that the money always belongs to the man. Or both. Whatever the explanation, she overstepped her bounds by trying to control and criticize how you shop. Your spending, or Matt's, is not hers to control.  I don't think you should fix this  by disclosing that your salary is higher than Matt's because it's private information. (Sometimes if you give people private iformation, they'll misuse it in the future.)\n\nI think it's problematic that, for Thanksgiving, you had to leave your own home and go to stay with your sister. I think it's problematic that his mother was calling you \"horrible\" over an argument stemming from what you spent on trash bags and mashed potatoes. I think it's problematic that you didn't get to eat the turkey you bought. \n\nAnd now Matt thinks you should discuss finances. I mean, ok, you probably SHOULD. Couples should have many discussions about finances. But this seems instigated by his mother's strange reasoning over miniscule grocery issues and suggests that Matt may be unable to draw a line and keep his mother out of your private financial conversations.", "So I'm not sure if you should cancel the engagement, but you have a lot to work through and consider. \n\nFirst, NTA for saying you don't need to be thrifty and going to a fancy grocery store and having...trash bags? Unless you flaunt your wealth (look at these expensive sunglasses I just bought), put down others for their lack of wealth (you could never afford these), or are tone deaf to how much others have to spend (Oh I thought we'd eat at this 5 star restaurant, we can split the bill right) then you aren't a \"snobby diva.\" You took his mother to a grocery store where you were paying, it was in your price range, and it is a grocery store, not Louis Vuitton. \n\nSecond, Matt allowed you to be run out of your own home and to spend the holiday away, while he stayed with his mother. That would almost be a dealbreaker for me. You didn't need to stay with her after she yelled at you, it doesn't matter that she ended up in tears- she did that to herself by being upset that you aren't \"thrift\" which is ridiculous because it has no impact on her. \n\nThird, you need to really think about what a future with Matt looks like. This will always be his mother, and this is how she acts, and he will also react to it exactly this way- blaming you, excusing her, pushing you to the side. \n\nSo finally, sit down with Matt and talk about it. He wants to discuss finances, I'd love to hear what he has to say about that, especially when you are the breadwinner right now. And you don't have to live within the budget his mother wants for you, you have to live within the budget you can afford and the two of you agree too. Then discuss his behavior, not his mother's. He ruined a holiday and stayed with his mother in your home while you had to stay elsewhere, he called you a \"snobby diva\" and didn't even attempt to defend you, when you are the one spending money on this holiday, you are the one doing the work for this holiday, you are the one taking his mother around to get this holiday together, and he made YOUR thanksgiving meal with her and now calls you names and wants to talk money with you? No way I'd put up with that bullshit.", "NTA. The mom sounds a bit unhinged & Matt sounds like a mamma's boy. I'd definitely reconsider the engagement. Do you really want this woman being a constant fixture in your life?", "Sounds like Matt gave his mom a *very incorrect* version of your financial situation together. Because of ego? Because he knew his mom wouldn't approve? Who knows\n\nNTA but I'm side-eyeing Matt here", "NTA\n\nThis is my first holiday season as a married lady, and my mom suddenly became a real arse as well.  The root of it was that things were different now, and she was reacting to the change poorly.  So every. little. thing. that wasn't exactly her way was suddenly a major issue.  \n\nAnd I had to sit her down and tell her, essentially, tough titties.  Things ARE different now and they're never going back, so you need to put on your big girl panties and deal.  I am balancing two families now, so if you change your holiday plans last minute, I probably cannot accommodate that and may be booked.  I cannot attend a family holiday event every weekend in December because we need to do things with his family too.  I am buying a different stuffing now because his side of the family needs gluten free, the Trader Joe's gluten free cornbread stuffing is bomb, and I'm not making two dishes when honestly you would like this if you tried it and it holds up better, IMO, for leftovers.  You can buy and make stovetop if it's essential to you, but this is what I am buying and cooking.  \n\nBut that's the thing: MY mom, so I sat her down and set boundaries.  The most concerning part about this to me is that your fiance didn't do the same.  Her behavior is...well, sadly not terribly uncommon for someone who is dealing with her baby growing up and her holiday traditions changing.  But coddling her isn't the right call, and it's concerning that's what your fiance chose.  My husband would have backed me 100%, told his mom to shape up or ship out because I would not be leaving my own home over the holidays, and called her out on her behavior.  Your family loves you and is concerned you might be marrying someone who doesn't have your back and puts mommy first.  They're right.  Your fiance needs to get his rear in gear and cut that umbilical cord.  If he's not ready to choose his spouse over mommy, then he's not ready to be married no matter what his chronological age is.", "What she said is the key here. \u2018Spending HER son\u2019s money\u2019 equates to \u2018HER\u2019 money. She has eyes of the prize which is her son funding her retirement. And you are in the way as you are not saving your money for her needs. \n\nI\u2019d have a proper sit down with him and find out exactly what he wants for the future. And I bet he wants part of that to be his mother living with you and him paying her bills. \n\nNTA.", "INFO: i'm sorry... did they seriously eat the thanksgiving dinner *you* paid for??", "I'm not saying you shouldn't marry him, but I am saying, you shouldn't marry him *until you get things sorted with his mom.* If he's taking her side over something as ridiculous as telling you how to shop for yourself, you don't want to know what things will look like when she's telling how to get married or how to raise kids. \n\nAfter money, not being able to stand up to their own parents is the biggest issue I see that breaks down otherwise happy marriages. You want a partner who sides with you when his parents are overbearing. You don't currently have that. Figure out if you ever will before marriage. \n\nNTA.", "Info:  Have you and Matt sat down and talked without either of your family members being involved?", "NTA...Clearly his mother has issues with another woman in her baby's life.  How you run your household is none of her business and the fact that Matt doesn't have your back is concerning.  Matt wants to talk finances, you need to talk about the future, because there are definitely some questions there.", "Nta theres nothing wrong with being thrifty even if you do make good money but she was being over the top. It sounds like she had already made up her mind about you and was scrapping the bottom of the barrel by having an issue with the trash bags and hand soap.Making him run out to get extra food when the food there is fine isnt exactly thrifty. I presume her main issue was she felt threatened things werent done the way she did them in her household for Matt and not so much about money.", "NTA\n\nYou should definitely have a finances discussion prior to the wedding, and ideally before you start putting down deposits for venues and caterers and whatnot. \n\nBUT\n\nThere ALSO needs to be a discussion about Matt's mommy issues. Because if he's willing to unilaterally cancel YOUR Thanksgiving, AND eat the food you bought, then there's a potential problem brewing. \n\nYou need to know now if Matt is going to prioritize his mommy over you, and take appropriate steps accordingly.", "NTA, but this relationship is not going to work out.  His mother is going to be a thorn in the side of your relationship and if you have kids, it is going to get even worse.  The fact that he did not unequivocally have your back tells me you are going to have a lifetime problem.", "[removed]", "How does her flipping out about trash bags and stuffing equal you acting like a \u201csnobby diva\u201d? You were just putting groceries away. She\u2019s the one who lost her mind over it. \n\nAnd she has some audacity to then turn around and eat the food you paid for after yelling at you about wasting her son\u2019s money. \n\nI\u2019ve seen similar situations to yours a lot here on Reddit. Typically the mom raised her son alone due to the dad\u2019s physical or emotional absence (dad left/died or is emotionally stunted) and she turns to the son for emotional support. I think that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here. \n\nIt may not be full-blown emotional incest, but at the very least it sounds like they are emotionally enmeshed. It\u2019s an extremely toxic dynamic and it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019d ever be healthy enough for a marriage, to you or anyone else, at least not without intense therapy. \n\nNTA for your response, but you need to realize he\u2019s never going to take your side over hers, regardless of the ridiculousness of her behavior. He had to do some serious mental gymnastics to make this your fault. Do you really want a lifetime of that? Where his mom causes drama and you\u2019re blamed for your response to it? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019d be signing up for if you go forward with the wedding.", "I would go to several premarital financial counseling sessions.

That is fine and understandable, I guess, but what it doesn't make ok is forcing your experience or wants on someone else.  \n\n\nShe was a guest in your home and immediately came at you with some pretty misogynistic communication about how you need to be a better partner to your bf and not \"spend his money\"? I have to wonder if she even knows about the monetary dynamic of your relationship currently.   \n\n\nI also support your leaving the situation versus letting things escalate. I think that was a mature thing to do.  \n\n\nMatt wanting to talk about finances after mommy left is troubling and problematic. Obviously momma was in her ear trying to \"poison the well\" the rest of the time she was there, and it sounds like Matt really listened.   \n\n\nThis is a **very important** time within your relationship.

AND ALSO how HE will handle telling his mother about the decisions YOU BOTH made. A financial counselor can help work through all this.\n\nHow you or him spend money is absolutely none of either his mother's or your family's business. She was way out of line.

I don't know if it's some kind of reaction to no longer being the most important woman in their son's life or that person being able to \"take care\" of her baby better, what. But I know my mom really struggled with my brother's partner, wanting to be close to her but also totally unable to stop from making judgy comments and breaking her boundaries.

If she wanted to make a special family tradition dish, it would be nice of you to let her and help her get the supplies, but I'm assuming she's perfectly capable of going to a grocery store on her own, too. Her reaction was not class shock -- it was very much the meltdown of a mother who is really struggling with the above paragraph.\n\nIf Matt refuses to acknowledge or listen to that, then you may have to ask yourself how much you're willing to put up with these episodes every time your MIL is involved. It's not likely to stop being an issue unless he stops enabling the irrational behavior. \"Rational emotions but irrational behavior based on them\" is definitely a thing.

Either he told her explicitly that he\u2019s the breadwinner or she assumed and he has not corrected her. This is a huge red flag.

Clearly MIL overstepped in this situation.  It appears to me that your BF has misled his Mom as to who is the breadwinner in your household.\n\nYou also mentioned you make 6 figures, your Mom is an Engineer and your Dad is a lawyer.  Based on that information, I'm guessing money has never been an issue for you.  It clearly has been and still is for MIL. \n\nAs a former single mom, (kids are now adults)  I can certainly appreciate her need/desire to be thrifty.  I can also relate to her idea of what is \"wasteful\".   Being poor requires making constant choices where prices are concerned.  So when you make purchases without any price comparison, she see's it as wasteful.   It may be a non issue to you, but it's a big deal to her.  Again, I'm not defending her, just trying to shed light on where she might be coming from.  She definitely could have handled it better.  \n\n  She thinks her son is the breadwinner and you are wasting his money.  She's wrong, however her judgments are based on incorrect information.

But you and Matt should seriously engage in some premarital counseling before you go any further. Since your families or origin come from dramatically different economic situations you need a plan. Is Matt going to be responsible for supporting Tina in her retirement (My guess is yes, fyi)? Does he have a fantasy of you being a stay-at-home partner who reads the Tightwad Gazette and sews your own cloth napkins out of leftover clothes?

How do YOU feel about supporting his mom even though your own family doesn't want or need that kind of support?

Matt was raised by a single mom Tina. It was the first time Tina came to stay with us over Thanksgiving. \n\nI get that there is some class difference. Tina worked mainly in restaurant and retail jobs to make ends meet. My mom is an engineer and my dad is a lawyer. \n\nTina stayed on our couch and immediately tried to make me into this thrifty housewife for her son although I\u2019m currently making more than him as he\u2019s finishing his post grad internship.  \n\nIt became hostile about things like our hand soap in the bathroom. Kitchen towels and trash bags. We got into a major fight over them. I normally just use the trash bags that originally came with our trash can. \n\nI never really paid attention to the price but after we got back from grocery shopping and I didn't get stove top stuffing or mashed potatoes she was mad at me. She didn't like the grocery store I chose to get our mini Thanksgiving dinner. \n\nWe went to our loft and she started yelling at me about how I didn't need to shop the way I do and that I needed to wise up money wise and not waste her son\u2019s money. Again I make 6 figures while her son is wrapping up his internship but after that, he should match or exceed my pay in two years so the price of milk and trash bags is not something I think of. \n\nI told her that. I don't know what happened but she starts crying saying about how horrible I am. I got angry at her and left her in the loft and texted Matt about her. I went to stay with my sister and her girlfriend who lives on the other side of the city overnight. They were planning to come to our mini Thanksgiving (this is Wednesday night) Matt asked if we could now skip hosting because his mom is not in a good place and I upset her. They ended up eating the turkey I was going to prepare and then made Matt rush to get stovetop stuffing and instant potatoes. He dropped  overnight bag off at my sister's. Normally Matt and my sister have a good relationship but she yelled at him. \n\nHis mom left but Matt thinks we should discuss finances. My whole family heard about what happened over trash bags and Matt canceling Thanksgiving. My family is angry at him and his mom. My mom thinks I should cancel the engagement but Matt and his mom think I\u2019m awful for just leaving his mom crying in the apartment and I acted like a \u201csnobby diva\u201d to her.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH\n\nI am an Engineer and I worked my ass off to get my degree, I worked all my way through college and have done many years of retail before I could get to where I am. My mother reminds me a little bit of your fianc\u00e9's mom. \n\nThis is clearly a clash in cultures, she comes from a completely different background and her life experiences have forced her to look at money differently than you.  her whole life lens is different than yours. \n\nShe has overstepped her boundaries and I think if you want to have a relationship with Matt, you need to have a conversation with him first and he needs to have a conversation with her to make her realize that the way you and him live is different than the way she lives. But this most likely came as a shock to her. I am not defending her posture, I am seeing it from a perspective of living some of her experiences and after many years living in a completely different way myself. It takes years to digest some of this. \n\nCommunication will be key.", "NTA - however, being poor can induce trauma. This woman was in an existential crisis all or most of her life. Seeing someone being wasteful (not that you actually are but it might look like this from her point of view) can trigger existential fears. \n\nShe overstepped but I suppose it came from worry and fear. She needs to learn and actually believe that you're not in such a dire position.", "YTA.....  \nI do want to add, this is the first time Matt's mom has come for thanksgiving. A lot of context is lost here, but is it possible mom feels insuperior due too finances and thought maybe this one Thanksgiving she could provide nostalgia for her son?\n\nShe (Tina) definitely handled it wrong, should have communicated better. And thats where OP maybe is in the wrong, because maybe Tina would have been able to communicate better if she (OP) had empathy for MIL. \n\nIt's not on OP to accommodate, but sometimes we need to hold our tongues or be accommodable for our in-laws (especially foreign ones) when they are staying with us for the sake of our partners. Gotta wonder about how child rearing will be if you can't come to agreements on trash bags.....", "NTA for just pointing out that you don't have to watch every penny. Depending on how this all escalated, my guess is ESH on the argument that followed.\n\nBy your story, Tina sounds like she has to work through some issues. She probably made so many sacrifices over the years for Matt that it's hard to mentally adjust to less vigilant spending habits. She may legitimately fear that you and Matt are headed toward financial hardship. She may also be insecure about the fact that she couldn't provide for him as generously as she wanted.\n\nMatt HAS to intervene in this situation to get Tina to calm down. He needs to reassure her where she's feeling worry, and rein her in where she's trying to mold you into her vision.", "It can be wildly eye-opening to see your spouse through your family's eyes, and vice-versa.  His mom sounds like she is insecure and overly emotional, maybe even unbalanced.\n\nYou sound a bit superior and cold and your story sounds very one sided even for AITA.  Rather than running away you should have just told her that you were spending money you'd earned yourself and that you could afford your purchases.", "ESH.First off---you may not need to be thrifty now, but you never know when disaster could strike.You could have learned A LOT about Matt, his mom, and his upbringing by asking about her experiences as a single mom instead of taking the bait with her criticisms (which to her may not have been criticisms)  \n\n\nMatt's mom is an a h for her comment about 'wasting my son's money'.

Let's pretend you **were** wasting her son's money. She still shouldn't comment. That's between you and him. By the same token, I'd do the best you can to stop involving your greater families in this conflict. Canceling plans seems extreme. I strongly suspect you engaged with these topics harder than you needed to, and a little diplomatic boundary setting could have been beneficial, but as I said,  we've got only your perspective.", "NTA she doesnt get to dictate how you live or spend your money! if he cant understand that and side with you that relationship will surely end in divorce", "Nta definitely pause the engagement, his mom yelled at you and he\u2019s upset you left? These are big problems and you need to ask yourself if this dynamic is going to work. I would not let a hyper critical person into my life especially when they assume you are a gold digger wasting her son\u2019s money.", "NTA. Whatever relationship you have with her son, Tina has no right to come into your home and start dictating the terms of your life to you (even if she had a point, and I\u2019m not saying she does). You weren\u2019t the asshole for leaving to go to your sister\u2019s place, and imo you wouldn\u2019t have even been the asshole if you had kicked her out for treating you like that in your own home. It sounds at this moment that you and Matt haven\u2019t had time to sit down, breathe and actually discuss what happened face to face. You both need to prioritize that, because until you do, you won\u2019t really have each other\u2019s side of the story. That said, if in the end he is unable to reach the conclusion that his mother has no right to speak to you like that in the home you share with him, then it really is time to reconsider the future of this relationship. I have a feeling that he\u2019s relying on Tina\u2019s heavily sanitized account of events, so it\u2019s possible that once he hears your direct recounting, he\u2019ll understand that he was operating under false pretenses. Give him that chance, but not much more. If any part of him believes his mother was justified in treating you as she did, then yeah, it\u2019s likely time for you to call off the engagement. \n\nYou\u2019re not an asshole, Tina is, and the verdict is still out on Matt.", "NTA wooooooow is she a bad houseguest. Does Matt find it appropriate to visit and stay in someone's home and immediately start criticizing them? Then why does he think it's appropriate for his mom to do it to you. So is he the reason she thinks he's paying for everything or did she just assume? How can someone possibly be hostile over handsoap??", "NTA - Matt needs to handle his family and you need to handle yours.  You two go talk it out and set some ground rules.  One of the rules should be that no family member stays over at your home during holidays from either side.  The other is to keep the drama between you and Matt.  Don't talk about family members to other family members in any sort of disparaging way.  You both made this much larger drama than what it should be so just zip it.\n\nMom believes you are taking her little boy from her.  She struggled and skimped to feed and raise him.  She has an extreme interest in his well being and money has always been a sore spot for her.  If you've never been poor, you will never understand why trash bags are even an issue.  It's not about the trash bags, it's that you had the money to choose the most expensive ones, where she probably never has.\n\nYou and Matt are going to have a very serious conversation with her and the rest of the family members on both sides, regarding love and space and her/their  involvement with your decisions as a couple.", "NTA.

I was 20yo when I got married and I didn't have to be told that it was my responsibility to handle. My husband and I sat down and talked about all of this stuff before we got married. We discussed the problem people in our families, how family issues would be dealt with. We discussed how finances would go, where we would live, how we would handle disagreements that were black and white and couldn't be compromised. We told each other our visions of what we wanted our futures to look like, we discussed split of household and parental duties, and morals and beliefs about marriage and parenthood.  We were trying to build a life together, so life needed to be talked about a lot. Please, don't get married without every one of these conversations. It was so worth all of the effort, too.

It is getting on a shared wavelength.  \n\nTHEN, you both need to agree to stand up for each other to support and defend this chosen way of living, and yes, it appears Matt will have the heavy lifting to set some serious boundaries with his mom.

Both of them clearly resent you so not exactly a good foundation for a marriage.  \n\n[run away!](https://images.app.goo.gl/axMaGDK16jXtSb3c8)", "Then you definitely have a Matt problem.", "So she's a racist as well?", "She wants a black DIL, eh?", "You can do better than Matt.", "Ugh, no. You can shop where you want and mommy dearest has no business trying to control it. She sounds like she will always be a nightmare tbh", "What.", "I think it\u2019s a class thing tbh. Not a gf/mother of bf thing. I think no matter what \u201cbougie\u201d different expensive thing you\u2019ll get, she\u2019ll be against it because you\u2019re not like \u201cher\u201d and her son.\n\nAlso, you don\u2019t handle money the way they do. Neither is wrong just different. It\u2019s weird she got defensive instead of being gracious with the homemade meal\u2026", "Most people would have tried figuring out what the actual issue was with her or your BF before coming to reddit with a partial story about what seems to be an absurd overreaction to something. Why did you decide to come here first and ask our opinion before actually talking with BF or mom?", "A gracious hostess would have made the future MIL feel comfortable and welcome. It's about picking battles. The woman wants potatoes from a box (no, just no!) and Stovetop stuffing. These are probably comfort foods for her. OP could have just given in and made the Stovetop but promised Tina would love her mashed potatoes - a tradition for her own Thanksgiving.\n\nWas Tina a nice guest? No way! But taking the low road seldom ends well. Walking out and going somewhere else for the duration of the visit had to feel very cold and unwelcoming to Tina, who seems like she already had a chip on her shoulder.\n\nOP plans to marry into this family - starting off on a bad note seems like a terrible idea. I am of the \"kill them with kindness\" school of thought.", "Agreed, which is why I said NTA.\n\nI'm not saying by any means OP is in the wrong or needs to apologize. Her FMIL is in need of some counseling to deal with her baggage, for SURE. But, if things move forward with the marriage, this woman will be in her life for the remainder of their relationship. They need to find a mutual agreement, whatever it might be - not talking about spending habits would be my suggestion, so they can move forward past this.", "Def not acceptable, I did say she overstepped. What I'm saying is she was most likely very shocked to see such a different lifestyle. \n\nMatt needs to talk to his mom, and bridge that gap.", "There are people you\u2019re never going to win with and your FMIL and this commenter are both good examples.\n\nBought groceries for the meal? You bought the wrong groceries.\nResponded to FMIL\u2019s yelling by defending yourself? Should have just taken it. \nResponded to FMIL\u2019s yelling by leaving the home to keep the peace? You obviously think you\u2019re better than her.", "\"I get that there is some class difference\"", "hear Matt out on what he has to say about the finance. you might be shocked he is on your side", "Grad students often get big loans. It doesn't sound like OP is funding his education - he's likely taking out student loans for education and since OP is a high earner that's covering the majority of the cost of living, he'd have some to sneak over to mom.\n\nBut yes, she's expecting it.", "Maybe with OP money", "There's also probably some jealousy at OP for having the experience of being treated like a wife by Matt, when Matt's mother never got that chance.", "Learn something new everyday", "Yeah seriously buying cheaper versions of food you already have doesn't save money.", "I doubt it was actually about the money they likely just preferred box potatoes and pre-made rolls. They feel bad or judged I guess for liking those more so make up the money reason as an excuse.", "I remember the first time I had instant mashed potatoes as a kid.  It was divine.  I don\u2019t know if they have anything in common with real mashed potatoes but, at that time, I didn\u2019t care.", "Depending on the brand and how you make them they can be okay, usually following the box turns them into a soupy mess but you can get a decent texture if you play around and are in a pinch. I tend to just keep a box around for laziness and filler if a batch of actual mash ends up a touch too liquid.\n\nBut either way the way his mom shops is the type of thing that frustrates me with overly \"frugal\" people. Looking at price only and not how much it makes or how long it will last. Location and time they have to cook and a few other factors play a role. But so often they can be saving so much more if they planned out multiple meals with one ingredient or bulk buying. I get if you just like the box taste better go for it, but if your only concern is saving money the box stuff probably wont do it unless you get into being one of those extreme couponers.\n\nHelping a friend work on meal prepping they almost cut their grocery bill in half over buying all the box or frozen stuff.", "Reading between the lines, specifically, how mother-in-law wanted some cheaper items, she may have felt that her family traditions were not being honored and/or were being disrespected. \n\nPeople are weird about Thanksgiving food.  I am an obnoxious foodie gourmand, so I love a nontraditional Thanksgiving, but some people really need to have their traditional foods. \n\nAnd in my opinion, people make some really gross shit for Thanksgiving. So much nasty processed food from cans and jars and boxes. But that\u2019s all some people can afford or have ever done and it takes a Herculean effort to be nice and respectful about it for me. \n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that OP was not being respectful of the foods that MIL and Matt traditionally have, and everyone communicated terribly about it. \n\nUltimately Matt and MIL are the AH, put OP might do well to do some inspection to see if she started it or worsened it by turning her nose up at boxed mashed potatoes or boxed stuffing. Giving my honest opinion about things like that has gotten me in trouble more than once, and people can be very defensive about it.", "to me what he\u2019s saying is \u201cshe\u2019s not gonna change, I\u2019ve dealt with it my whole life and become numb, appeasing her is better than having to listen to her complain all day long\u201d", "I\u2019m assuming a store like Whole Foods vs a cheaper grocery store chain.", "Some stores are definitely oriented towards different demographics. Whether those demographics include racial ones is undoubtedly regional.\n\nIn my city there's a handful of connected but otherwise independent grocery stores that are considered a bit more upscale, but there's also a specific branch of it that's known to be extra expensive on top of that. It's bougie as fuck. There's also one literally called \"the good grocer\".\n\nThe thing is I'd have to drive annoyingly far to get to one of the cheap chains. It's super irritating when people tell me I could buy things cheaper at ALDI. Maybe, although the one time I went there because I'd gone somewhere one actually existed their selection was trash, but the savings literally wouldn't be worth my time at my average hourly rate.", "He\u2019s black. I\u2019m half white and Korean.", ">What does that mean, aren't groceries just groceries?  I didn't know stores were segregated. \n\nEh... there's the \"good\" stores, and then the \"*really* good\" stores, and depending on where you live, there's the \"only the really picky rich people can shop here\". What store is what is usually dependent on the area of town it's in and how much resources the chain pours into it (for example, we have four Kroger's in our town, and one is the regional chain, and everyone calls it the \"Gucci\" Kroger because it's out in the rich area of town, gets all the specialty foods and mini-shops, and is generally nicer).  And, again, depending on where you live, there may be racial overtones because of how neighborhoods have ended up segregated in some places.", "I\u2019m wondering if OP went to H-Mart or Lotte Plaza to pick up the ingredients she needed and MIL was super uncomfortable because they\u2019re Asian grocery stores with American aisles instead of an American grocery store with an International aisle.\n\nMy stepkids get overwhelmed when I hit up the Asian market because they don\u2019t recognize many things and much of the packaging isn\u2019t in English. I\u2019m always amused when they\u2019ll eat a snack when it\u2019s plated or in a bowl, but won\u2019t eat the same wasabi peas out of the can because they can\u2019t read the label.", "Thanksgiving was a week ago. Who said she went here first?", "Because as a society we have become isolated and some that are more self aware recognize their own mind is a silo and need other opinions to mull over before tackling a major issue in their lives. \n\nWhy did you decide to read a subreddit full of people's problems then ask why they are posting their problem?", "I think you are talking about different kinds of class. \n\nI think you are meaning in the sense of being \"classy'/upscale, sophisticated. \n\nBut OP was referring to social/economic class difference. Aka poor class, working class, middle class, upper class. \n\nIn that regards they 100% are from different economic/social classes. An dual income engineer/lawyer salary is going to be waaaay different than a single income waitress income. \n\nIt does not make one or the other better/worse. I've met shitty and good people from all classes. \n\nBut to pretend like class difference are not a thing is wrong.", "and you think that translates too 'I think I'm better because I have money'? cause it absolutely does not", "Because of that fact, I don\u2019t think it was entirely about the money. \n\nI think it\u2019s that she felt her Thanksgiving traditional foods (which happen to be boxed and processed) weren\u2019t being respected, and the store they went to (Whole Foods? Trader Joe\u2019s?) didn\u2019t have the brands she was expecting. \n\nMy family would not prefer homemade stuffing to a box, nor would they prefer homemade bread to a bag of Parker house or Hawaiian rolls, and no Thanksgiving would be complete without green been casserole and cranberry sauce, both from a can.  \n\nThis doesn\u2019t excuse her behavior, but maybe it will help OP understand future MIL\u2019s behavior in a different light.", "Box mashed potatoes are a magical ingredient they belong in every kitchen. Great thickener for a host of things. It\u2019s unfortunate that they make such terrible mashed potatoes.", "It could even just be location.\n\nWhere I live, there are Smith's (kroger). \n\nSome of them have separate aisles for all the beauty products. Every item is behind a locked case, and you have to pay for it before you leave the aisle. Same thing with liquor and beer.\n\nThe one's in the more affluent neighborhoods do not have these.", "lol to be fair though, I would also side eye her if it was Erewhon. That would be an exception.", "Ah yeah. So there are definitely some racial dynamics in play here and I think both you and Matt need to really dig in there to get that figured out before y\u2019all get married.", "I hope you have *outstanding* birth control right now.  Is this your first time meeting his mother?", "girl you buried the lede here mad hard\n\nI'm half black, I'm telling you right now this shit ain't gonna change nor get better.\n\nlisten to your parents.", "Ah.\n\nYeah, you and Matt and Matt and his mom have a LOT of talking to do if you\u2019re going to stay together as a couple.", "Gucci Kroger...made me laugh for the day!  The girl in the cubicle next to me stopped work and looked at me.", "That would be Buschs vs walmart where i live.  Buschs is strictly food groceries, the nice high end stuff with a whole aisle dedicated to non jarred spices and an actual butcher at the meat counter. And well.. walmart has its own meme page on most platforms called \"the people of walmart\" for a reason. \n\nMy mil tried getting me to shop at Aldis. But sure while the prices are great, it is not a huge one-stop shop, and I've got a 3yo to manage. Hell, it takes 2 hours as it is to shop between her and the lines in just walmart.", "Ha! We have a Gucci Kroger where I live, too\u2014it is literally less than a mile from another, less fancy Kroger!! Bizarre!!", "That is definitely fair, I would too.", "That store is insane \ud83d\ude2d it makes stores like Whole Foods look like the Grocery Outlet", "What, the rice cake brand? Those are really good tho!", "I Love Aldi.  It's small and manageable, they don't have everything, but I am starting to just live without some things.  I hate going to the big stores.", "Hell, I used to live in a town with literally three Walmarts, and there were differences even then. There was posh Walmart, middle-class Walmart, and the \"People of Walmart\" Walmart. If there was ever a fight to be seen, it was there, and the products weren't as nice.", "The grocery store."]}
