I have to be aware of every penny I spend in order to get the most of my money when it comes to food. Every week I have a grocery budget, I plan out all meals and what I get for the week is what we have, I do not do extra grocery runs during the week unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. \n\nMy bf pays for about 30% of groceries and I pay 70% because he pays more for utilities so it evens out. However I always tell him, if he wants additional food or if he\u2019s still hungry he can get it himself (keep in mind we are not portion restricted). \n\nI bought a standard size tub of sour cream and it was supposed to be used in 3 different meals. I told him this. I came home today ready to make dinner and it was gone. Not even used for one meal. He just snacked on it throughout the day. Admittedly I blew up and started crying asking him why he would do that when he knows that it was supposed to be used for several meals. I try so hard to budget and save money and I feel like he just doesn\u2019t care. I told him he can either buy a new tub or I\u2019m not cooking for the rest of the week. I told him it\u2019s a matter of respect, he thinks it\u2019s no big deal and I can just go get a new tub and is making a point of saying I should be the one to get it not him. \n\nHe says I\u2019m being dramatic for crying over sour cream and I know it\u2019s not super expensive (about $3 where I\u2019m at) but it\u2019s the principle. I\u2019m just upset that he can\u2019t respect what I\u2019m trying to do and he doesn\u2019t understand that we are strapped for money right now. AITA?\n\nMini update: those of you who said it\u2019s not really about the sour cream but about being disrespected are 100% correct. Also the greek yogurt has remained untouched so I\u2019ll be using that and any future sour cream purchases will come from him", "created_utc": 1697515239, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/179pkpl/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_bf_for_finishing_a_tub/", "score": 4986, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "HOW. Is he just eating it by the spoonful like ice cream? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "NTA. I find snacking on sour cream so ICK, I know it's similar to yogurt but in my mind it's a condiment only.\n\nIgnoring budget entirely, when something is for a meal, you don't use it. This was communicated. Depending on my day/energy level I could be close to tears.\n\nThen there is the budget factor and making what's on sale work for meals, he probably doesn't understand the work that goes into that.", "INFO: Why does he think you should be the one to go to the store to get another?", "NTA. That\u2019s infuriating. Make him take on all of the mental load and responsibility of grocery shopping and you pay for the utilities - he will learn how much he disrespected your money and time. Your arrangement doesn\u2019t seem equal if you are spending way more time and effort to fulfill your portion, js.", "NTA. For me, it's the fact that he KNEW that you had earmarked that tub for other things. For full meals. And he just went and pigged out on the whole thing. And I know some people in here are like 'It's just sour cream, just go get another one/it's not a big deal'. Like the Iranian Yogurt, it's not just about the sour cream.\n\nWhen someone bursts into tears over someone deliberately trodding over a well established boundary/mention of usage, it's because it's the upteenth time they've done it. It wasn't just today's sour cream. It was likely also a whole loaf of bread, or a whole block of cheese, or the last half of the milk that was needed for xyz that went to him opting to drink milk when he usually doesn't. It's when the person that does the meal planning/cooking makes a clear statement of 'we/I need this for these things' in a 'don't touch it' way and someone just decides 'fuck you, I want to do what I want to do'. And then flips it around and shrugs and says \"It's just sour cream, go get a new tub\". \n\nThat's 3 bucks he could have spent himself on a tub of sour cream for himself if he wanted to pig out on it all day. Instead, he ignored that she needed it, used it, and then blamed her for being upset. And I'd bet actual cash money this isn't the first time, which is likely what makes it so frustrating for her. \n\nI'm sorry you're dating/living with a selfish jerk.", "NTA. If he wants you to plan, shop, and cook meals he\u2019s going to have to respect how you do it and not eat the ingredients before the meals are made. If he wants something extra he can go buy it or ask you to add it to your list. \n\nHe is definitely the one who should go to the store and buy a replacement. \n\nWhether or not he thinks you\u2019re being dramatic you have a valid argument. The problem is t how you express your emotions. It\u2019s what he did.", "Nta he SNACKED on sour cream? And completely disrespected the labor involved in planning and shopping. AND now your food isn't right without it. \nGeez. He owes you a tub of sour cream and some chocolate, tonight.", "NTA, who snacks on a whole tub of sour cream??", "All the planning and budgeting for food can be a lot of emotional labor in addition to time consuming. Do you also cook most of the meals? \n\nHe was inconsiderate and he doesn't seem appreciative of your efforts. Have him take over all the tasks associated with planning meals for a month. Maybe then he will have an appreciation for what you do for the household. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I recall the stress of money being that tight. Just have him go buy another tub with his own money and don't stress too much x", "\"Hey, you ate all the sour cream.  I need it for meal prep for three different meals.  Please go to the grocery store right now and get us a new tub of sour cream as I need to start cooking.  And this is coming out of your money, because I've already bought all the groceries that we needed.\"\n\nThere.  No screaming, no crying.  And after you've sent him to the grocery store in the middle of whatever he's doing to replace whatever he's taken from planned meals a couple of times, he'll get the picture.\n\nI also think you need to sit down with him and talk to him about what snacks he wants to eat during the day, and then he needs to purchase or give you the list and pay for those.  Your post seems to suggest that maybe there isn't enough for him to snack on.\n\nESH", "NTA. It's not even about the money. It's about the fact that he disrespected your time and mental energy spent shopping and meal planning and not only that he refuses to spend any time and energy of his own fixing it.", "NTA. It\u2019s a boundary thing from my perspective. If you bought an ingredient for a stated purpose and he ignored that, he created an additional task you need to perform again. \n\nLike when my ex husband ate all the Halloween candy and didn\u2019t mention it until I found the empty bar when it was time for kids to start arriving. Or a former bf helped himself to my rarely touched liquor and all I could offer guests was empty bottles (he\u2019d already been warned never to touch it again after the first time he drank it all). \n\nIf you are this upset, my guess he frequently ignores boundaries or puts an unfair mental in you even if things are financially fair.\n\nEdit: typo", "Can you two split utilities 50-50 and groceries 50-50 as well? Then he can get more food without the burden being on you completely.", "I think you are stressed out about the cost of living, and having to penny pinch, while he doesn't seem to get it. Your reaction was just the sour pickle in top of everything, that broke you. Not the ah", "NTA  On principle, *he* can just \"get another tub of sour cream.' He ought not just take your ingredients for meals you've planned without replacing them.", "NTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the sour cream ultimate. It\u2019s really about you feeling unappreciated for the work you put into planning to ensure that you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck. And, it\u2019s likely there\u2019s some stress mixed in there due to the fact that prices have increased.", "NTA lol have him go buy another sour cream tub", "NTA. It was rude of him to use the whole thing and not replace it after you specified everything you bought had a specific use.", "NTA... the Iranian Yogurt is not the issue here...", "NTA, tell tubby hubby to get another tubby. Just don't cry next time, talk to him sternly, and tell him to go get another tub. I'm assuming you guys plan meals together and would have known.", "NTA - what he did was rude and inconsiderate - also though you\u2019re putting a lot of stress and pressure into this that seems like it\u2019s coming from other places. I have a feeling that you got more than groceries being expensive to set you off and you should focus on that with your energy.", "NTA\n\nBuuuuuut, you\u2019ve overreacted. Like badly.\n\nI\u2019m just gonna assume that money is really on your mind and you\u2019re stressed out because your bf \u201cdoesn\u2019t respect what I\u2019m trying to do\u201d.\n\nImo, maybe have long think and then talk to him. In my experience the blow up you\u2019ve had is a reaction to severe stress not the cause. So you need to focus on resolving the cold rather than the sneeze if that makes sense.", "ESH\n\nHe obviously doesn\u2019t need to snack on a tub of sour cream, especially when you told him your specific plans for it. \nYou didn\u2019t need to blow up about it.  Simply tell him that dinner tonight needs the sour cream and he will need to go get it. NOW.", "NTA. It\u2019s valid that you\u2019re upset. You overreacted but it sounds like that probably came from stress about money and also from feeling like he\u2019s not being considerate of you. It also sounds like you\u2019re very organized about meal planning and budgets. As a fellow hyper-organized person, I also get thrown off when my planned meal schedule goes awry. That might be tied to control issues, perfectionism, etc. Try some coping mechanisms and to figure out exactly why you were so angry. If you think you overreacted them just apologize for that part of it and try to handle differently next time. Life truly is too short for that kind of stress.", "> it\u2019s the principal\n\nPrinciple.", "Youre both kind of assholes\n\nYou are for crying over something so silly\n\nHe is, because who the fuck just snacks on sour cream?", "i\u2019m so sorry but this is hilarious \ud83d\ude2d NTA", "Are you his toilet? Cuz I would\u2019ve blown up", "Sigh. This is such a tiny thing to be worried about.", "NTA if this wasn't the first time he did something like this. But imma keep it a buck, if a 3 dollar tub of sour cream is causing you to threaten to not cook for a week then  if possible you should definitely reevaluate your lifestyle if possible.", "YTA. I may have to consider unfollowing this subreddit. Is this seriously what we\u2019re arguing about now? Make him cough up $3 for new sour cream ffs. Find a budget grocery store or the dollar store if you\u2019re that bent over $3. Prices aren\u2019t THAT high, there\u2019s always a cheaper solution.", "YTA, it's a $3 snack.\n\nYou say that he was snacking all day, so he wasn't working. We know he pays bills though, so clearly he works. So he had a day off, probably planned to use the sour cream just as dip for a snack and zoned out snacking while enjoying his day off", "[deleted]", "Being upset that your bf forgot or disregarded that you initially said you were going to use the tub of sour cream is one thing. But, your reaction to it being gone is extreme. What is going on for you that you would cry about this? Are you feeling pretty stressed at the moment? Is there something underneath it all that you're not addressing but needs to be examined? I'm concerned for you.", "Tell me you're a drama queen without telling me...", "NTA\nAlso, man is a legend for asserting his dominance and eating the entire tub of sour cream. This type of behavior reinvigorates the patriarchal hold we have over the refrigerator and thermostat.", "[deleted]", "YTA, it\u2019s a small tub of sour cream. This reaction is way over the top. Makes me wonder what other small things are capable of making you react in such an unhinged manner. And how would you feel if it was you that ate the sour cream? Would you think it was okay for your bf to yell at you, treat you like crap, and cry about it? Or is there a double standard at play here? Look, I get it, I do 95% of the cooking in our house as my gf is a nurse and works long hours, it\u2019s frustrating when this happens. But there is absolutely no reason to act that way to your partner over a tub of sour cream. Absolutely blows my mind that there are so many people on here justifying the way that you acted over this.

I was in disbelief at how much he was willing to consume, and pissed that he didn\u2019t consider that we needed to stretch the sour cream across several meals. We had a fight, laughed about arguing over sour cream, fought again, and eventually settled on: he needs to be mindful of the fact that I purchase ingredients to make meals as the primary cook, and it\u2019s kind of him to ask or consider what we might need for the future, anddd I needed to get over the fact that sometimes you have to adjust your meal plan because someone does things differently from you.\n\nESH.

I have tumors wrapped around my gall bladder and pancreas which make eating anything difficult in the first place so I have to stick to very specific\nFoods and mostly vegetables.

I went along with it, I treated it like a game, a challenge, not knowing the amount of stress he was going through. \n\na couple of days later, I got a notification from his email box, saying that his account was gonna be frozen soon and that he only had like 12 dollars left.

Maybe the reaction it seems over dramatic, but if he's not willing to buy the new one, and doesn't see why it bothers you makes me feel he's not aware of how much you're struggling with food cost and doesn't apreciate you're cooking for boths. Maybe you guys should just separate de finances in a different way and he should just cook his own food if he doesn't get your point.", "NTA and also I was literally in this situation about a week ago - I was made redundant and so have been cutting costs and meticulously planning and taking care of the grocery shops. My boyfriend is an \u2018oh I\u2019ll whack this in there too\u2019 kind of person and likes to just cook on the fly with whatever we have. He hates planning meals.\n\nI planned for oyster mushroom nachos and he put in some kidney beans as well because \u2018why not\u2019. I\u2019d written out all the recipes and meals I\u2019d planned and stuck it on the fridge, he knew that this was there and just didn\u2019t check it.\n\nNow, a tin of kidney beans is literally 60p. By all logic this should not have been a big deal. But I was so, so upset and my boyfriend couldn\u2019t wrap his head around it. \n\nMuch like me, I feel that your reaction here likely wasn\u2019t actually about the sour cream and reducing it to that makes it all seem a bit silly. Your reaction comes from disregarded effort, disregarded time spent planning, disregarded mental energy and a lack of appreciation for the fact that you took on the burden of planning out a shop to put you both in the best possible financial position. He didn\u2019t listen to you, he didn\u2019t see your effort and he was totally unbothered about using up the entire tub for no reason other than because he wanted to when you had a specific plan and instructions. He didn\u2019t care.\n\nNot having your efforts acknowledged, your time appreciated and your plans respected really stings actually and things right now are just SO EXPENSIVE. Living with financial stress takes a toll and it\u2019s totally understandable that something like an entire tub of $3 sour cream being essentially wasted when you\u2019re on a budget and had plans for it can be a surprisingly big blow. That\u2019s several meals that are incomplete now!\n\nExplain your feelings, explain how it\u2019s not just the sour cream and try to be gentler with yourself and with eachother.

In ONE day? Absolutely not. Sorry, but if your bf has any respect for you at all, he can go pay the $3 himself to buy a new sour cream. Or better yet, he can be the one meal planning for the week while you snack on the ingredients he needs.", "I think the issue is he was inconsiderate and ate something that he knew the person who is responsible for cooking meals was going to use to cook a meal that day. He should have gotten a new one before you got home from work, because you\u2019re the one cooking.", "This is a huge red flag to me! He shows no respect for the mental load of having to meal plan and physical load of shopping especially on a budget. I\u2019m sure if you examine your relationship there are other places he shows a lack of respect for the mental/physical load you carry. Here\u2019s the question do you feel more like a parent or a partner?", "NTA but, I feel like this isn't just about sour cream.  It sounds like a mountain that has built of little things that just show he isn't respecting things that you are doing in general.

This is an opportunity to have a long conversation about how you are feeling about the whole situation.  \n\nBe aware this may be something that you have to prepare yourself that he may not be on board with changing or improving things.  He may also act like it matters and change for 2 weeks....or he might really change.  But pay attention.  You deserve someone who also is concerned about finances and respects the time you put into things.  \n\nHe should have offered to go immediately to get another one and apologized.  Or said I am so sorry I will pick one up on the way home from work tomorrow or when i go to do x.

Just don't go out and buy any more he will not get it.", "NTA. He's the AH for refusing to get another one after he finished the entire thing in just one day.

He ate it anyway. He should replace it. He should also probably get his heart checked out if his snacking includes eating a full TUB of sour cream in a single day because that is effing gross. \n\nAs an aside, I'd like to suggest swapping plain greek yogurt for sour cream if you're trying to stretch a tight food budget. It substitutes easily in most recipes and has a lot more nutrition, plus, he probably won't think of it as something to dip chips in.", "I think the primary issue here is that you (OP) are taking on the mental and emotional labor of budgeting for groceries and planning meals, which right now is especially difficult.

If you make $20/hr that's $26 for sour cream. \n\nHe thinks it's no big deal so he can fix it because it's no big deal for him either.\n\nFrom the book \"Somebody Moved My Cheese\", you got your cheese moved.  And he can either move it back or you can move his cheese by not cooking. It's no big deal for him either!\n\nTime for him to kick in 50% for food.

They told me this is what we do in our house and we can get more....he started doing this with my food as well and he doesn't seem to grasp I grew up with food insecurity and I don't gorge myself like him and his parents do. Nor do our children. They only eat when they're hingry or when it's snack time!

As the main chef in all the relationships I've ever had, I fully understand how annoying and disrespectful this is.\n\nPeople who don't plan meals might not get this, but missing an ingredient when you go to cook and being forced to cook the planned meals out of sequence often leads to stuff going past expiry and other annoying knock-on effects.\n\nedit: Also, part of the point of planning meals and buying all the ingredients in one go is because it saves you time so you don't have to keep going to the shop.

If it's no big deal, then why can't he go replace it? Stick to your guns on this one.

From his perspective, one minute he's chowing down on some good-ass sour cream (weird but OK) and the next minute you're crying. Without the context that is very sudden. Make sure he understands how tight your grocery budget is and that what seems like a innocent snacking choice might actually have a bigger impact.
