I have to be aware of every penny I spend in order to get the most of my money when it comes to food. Every week I have a grocery budget, I plan out all meals and what I get for the week is what we have, I do not do extra grocery runs during the week unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. \n\nMy bf pays for about 30% of groceries and I pay 70% because he pays more for utilities so it evens out. However I always tell him, if he wants additional food or if he\u2019s still hungry he can get it himself (keep in mind we are not portion restricted). \n\nI bought a standard size tub of sour cream and it was supposed to be used in 3 different meals. I told him this. I came home today ready to make dinner and it was gone. Not even used for one meal. He just snacked on it throughout the day. Admittedly I blew up and started crying asking him why he would do that when he knows that it was supposed to be used for several meals. I try so hard to budget and save money and I feel like he just doesn\u2019t care. I told him he can either buy a new tub or I\u2019m not cooking for the rest of the week.

NTA", "HOW. Is he just eating it by the spoonful like ice cream? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14", "NTA. I find snacking on sour cream so ICK, I know it's similar to yogurt but in my mind it's a condiment only.\n\nIgnoring budget entirely, when something is for a meal, you don't use it. This was communicated. Depending on my day/energy level I could be close to tears.\n\nThen there is the budget factor and making what's on sale work for meals, he probably doesn't understand the work that goes into that.", "INFO: Why does he think you should be the one to go to the store to get another?", "NTA. That\u2019s infuriating. Make him take on all of the mental load and responsibility of grocery shopping and you pay for the utilities - he will learn how much he disrespected your money and time. Your arrangement doesn\u2019t seem equal if you are spending way more time and effort to fulfill your portion, js.", "NTA. For me, it's the fact that he KNEW that you had earmarked that tub for other things. For full meals. And he just went and pigged out on the whole thing. And I know some people in here are like 'It's just sour cream, just go get another one/it's not a big deal'. Like the Iranian Yogurt, it's not just about the sour cream.\n\nWhen someone bursts into tears over someone deliberately trodding over a well established boundary/mention of usage, it's because it's the upteenth time they've done it. It wasn't just today's sour cream. It was likely also a whole loaf of bread, or a whole block of cheese, or the last half of the milk that was needed for xyz that went to him opting to drink milk when he usually doesn't. It's when the person that does the meal planning/cooking makes a clear statement of 'we/I need this for these things' in a 'don't touch it' way and someone just decides 'fuck you, I want to do what I want to do'. And then flips it around and shrugs and says \"It's just sour cream, go get a new tub\". \n\nThat's 3 bucks he could have spent himself on a tub of sour cream for himself if he wanted to pig out on it all day. Instead, he ignored that she needed it, used it, and then blamed her for being upset. And I'd bet actual cash money this isn't the first time, which is likely what makes it so frustrating for her. \n\nI'm sorry you're dating/living with a selfish jerk.", "NTA. If he wants you to plan, shop, and cook meals he\u2019s going to have to respect how you do it and not eat the ingredients before the meals are made. If he wants something extra he can go buy it or ask you to add it to your list. \n\nHe is definitely the one who should go to the store and buy a replacement. \n\nWhether or not he thinks you\u2019re being dramatic you have a valid argument. The problem is t how you express your emotions. It\u2019s what he did.", "Nta he SNACKED on sour cream? And completely disrespected the labor involved in planning and shopping. AND now your food isn't right without it. \nGeez. He owes you a tub of sour cream and some chocolate, tonight.", "NTA, who snacks on a whole tub of sour cream??", "All the planning and budgeting for food can be a lot of emotional labor in addition to time consuming. Do you also cook most of the meals? \n\nHe was inconsiderate and he doesn't seem appreciative of your efforts. Have him take over all the tasks associated with planning meals for a month. Maybe then he will have an appreciation for what you do for the household. \n\nNTA", "NTA. I recall the stress of money being that tight. Just have him go buy another tub with his own money and don't stress too much x", "\"Hey, you ate all the sour cream.  I need it for meal prep for three different meals.  Please go to the grocery store right now and get us a new tub of sour cream as I need to start cooking.  And this is coming out of your money, because I've already bought all the groceries that we needed.\"\n\nThere.  No screaming, no crying.  And after you've sent him to the grocery store in the middle of whatever he's doing to replace whatever he's taken from planned meals a couple of times, he'll get the picture.\n\nI also think you need to sit down with him and talk to him about what snacks he wants to eat during the day, and then he needs to purchase or give you the list and pay for those.  Your post seems to suggest that maybe there isn't enough for him to snack on.\n\nESH", "NTA. It's not even about the money. It's about the fact that he disrespected your time and mental energy spent shopping and meal planning and not only that he refuses to spend any time and energy of his own fixing it.", "NTA. It\u2019s a boundary thing from my perspective. If you bought an ingredient for a stated purpose and he ignored that, he created an additional task you need to perform again. \n\nLike when my ex husband ate all the Halloween candy and didn\u2019t mention it until I found the empty bar when it was time for kids to start arriving. Or a former bf helped himself to my rarely touched liquor and all I could offer guests was empty bottles (he\u2019d already been warned never to touch it again after the first time he drank it all). \n\nIf you are this upset, my guess he frequently ignores boundaries or puts an unfair mental in you even if things are financially fair.\n\nEdit: typo", "Can you two split utilities 50-50 and groceries 50-50 as well? Then he can get more food without the burden being on you completely.", "I think you are stressed out about the cost of living, and having to penny pinch, while he doesn't seem to get it. Your reaction was just the sour pickle in top of everything, that broke you. Not the ah", "NTA  On principle, *he* can just \"get another tub of sour cream.' He ought not just take your ingredients for meals you've planned without replacing them.", "NTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t about the sour cream ultimate. It\u2019s really about you feeling unappreciated for the work you put into planning to ensure that you\u2019re getting the most bang for your buck. And, it\u2019s likely there\u2019s some stress mixed in there due to the fact that prices have increased.", "NTA lol have him go buy another sour cream tub", "NTA. It was rude of him to use the whole thing and not replace it after you specified everything you bought had a specific use.", "NTA... the Iranian Yogurt is not the issue here...", "NTA, tell tubby hubby to get another tubby. Just don't cry next time, talk to him sternly, and tell him to go get another tub. I'm assuming you guys plan meals together and would have known.", "NTA - what he did was rude and inconsiderate - also though you\u2019re putting a lot of stress and pressure into this that seems like it\u2019s coming from other places. I have a feeling that you got more than groceries being expensive to set you off and you should focus on that with your energy.", "NTA\n\nBuuuuuut, you\u2019ve overreacted. Like badly.\n\nI\u2019m just gonna assume that money is really on your mind and you\u2019re stressed out because your bf \u201cdoesn\u2019t respect what I\u2019m trying to do\u201d.\n\nImo, maybe have long think and then talk to him. In my experience the blow up you\u2019ve had is a reaction to severe stress not the cause. So you need to focus on resolving the cold rather than the sneeze if that makes sense.", "ESH\n\nHe obviously doesn\u2019t need to snack on a tub of sour cream, especially when you told him your specific plans for it. \nYou didn\u2019t need to blow up about it.  Simply tell him that dinner tonight needs the sour cream and he will need to go get it. NOW.", "NTA. It\u2019s valid that you\u2019re upset. You overreacted but it sounds like that probably came from stress about money and also from feeling like he\u2019s not being considerate of you. It also sounds like you\u2019re very organized about meal planning and budgets. As a fellow hyper-organized person, I also get thrown off when my planned meal schedule goes awry. That might be tied to control issues, perfectionism, etc. Try some coping mechanisms and to figure out exactly why you were so angry. If you think you overreacted them just apologize for that part of it and try to handle differently next time. Life truly is too short for that kind of stress.", "> it\u2019s the principal\n\nPrinciple.", "Youre both kind of assholes\n\nYou are for crying over something so silly\n\nHe is, because who the fuck just snacks on sour cream?", "i\u2019m so sorry but this is hilarious \ud83d\ude2d NTA", "Are you his toilet? Cuz I would\u2019ve blown up", "Sigh. This is such a tiny thing to be worried about.", "NTA if this wasn't the first time he did something like this. But imma keep it a buck, if a 3 dollar tub of sour cream is causing you to threaten to not cook for a week then  if possible you should definitely reevaluate your lifestyle if possible.", "YTA. I may have to consider unfollowing this subreddit. Is this seriously what we\u2019re arguing about now? Make him cough up $3 for new sour cream ffs. Find a budget grocery store or the dollar store if you\u2019re that bent over $3. Prices aren\u2019t THAT high, there\u2019s always a cheaper solution.", "YTA, it's a $3 snack.\n\nYou say that he was snacking all day, so he wasn't working. We know he pays bills though, so clearly he works. So he had a day off, probably planned to use the sour cream just as dip for a snack and zoned out snacking while enjoying his day off", "[deleted]", "Being upset that your bf forgot or disregarded that you initially said you were going to use the tub of sour cream is one thing. But, your reaction to it being gone is extreme. What is going on for you that you would cry about this? Are you feeling pretty stressed at the moment? Is there something underneath it all that you're not addressing but needs to be examined? I'm concerned for you.", "Tell me you're a drama queen without telling me...", "NTA\nAlso, man is a legend for asserting his dominance and eating the entire tub of sour cream. This type of behavior reinvigorates the patriarchal hold we have over the refrigerator and thermostat.", "[deleted]", "YTA, it\u2019s a small tub of sour cream. This reaction is way over the top. Makes me wonder what other small things are capable of making you react in such an unhinged manner. And how would you feel if it was you that ate the sour cream? Would you think it was okay for your bf to yell at you, treat you like crap, and cry about it? Or is there a double standard at play here? Look, I get it, I do 95% of the cooking in our house as my gf is a nurse and works long hours, it\u2019s frustrating when this happens. But there is absolutely no reason to act that way to your partner over a tub of sour cream. Absolutely blows my mind that there are so many people on here justifying the way that you acted over this. Guarantee that if this was a man losing his shit on his gf over sour cream this sub would be in an uproar.", "> I blew up and started crying asking him why he would do that when he knows that it was supposed to be used for several meals\n\nInfo: did he actually know that?

A few months ago, I experienced almost the exact same scenario in our home.\n\nBought sour cream to use for portions of chili to be eaten by me and my husband for a few days. We go into the kitchen together and each prep our first bowl of yummy chili with cheese and cornbread\u2026and he plops half the container of sour cream onto his meal. My mouth was agape and I considered he was doing a bit and being gratuitous. Then I was inexplicably furious when I realized he was actually using that much sour cream. I was in disbelief at how much he was willing to consume, and pissed that he didn\u2019t consider that we needed to stretch the sour cream across several meals. We had a fight, laughed about arguing over sour cream, fought again, and eventually settled on: he needs to be mindful of the fact that I purchase ingredients to make meals as the primary cook, and it\u2019s kind of him to ask or consider what we might need for the future, anddd I needed to get over the fact that sometimes you have to adjust your meal plan because someone does things differently from you.\n\nESH.
