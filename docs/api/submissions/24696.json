The criminal had left her in a place that is known to have a lot of homeless people and drug users. \n\nSome people saw her unconcious and an ambulance needed to be called twice because the first time she wasn't given proper care. \n\nHer sibling, her friend and the Uber driver will feel guilty for years, probably forever.
