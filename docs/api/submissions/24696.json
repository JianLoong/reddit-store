As in the one that\u2019s getting attacked and targeted?", "How is she not a minority?! They are related!\nSome guy at a bar is suddenly considered company one travels with? If anything were to happen to her he could just ditch her or God knows what else. \nAnd I would definitely not trust a drunk person to \"handle it\".", "Well she is an adult so he can't really stop her. And she is an adult and she can make her own risk management.", "Okay but are we not going to acknowledge she's in a foreign country with no cell/money being aggoe'd and handed drinks by a *group* of unknown men?\n\nI get it, can't force ignorant people not to get kidnapped and sold in slave trade, but maybe we still should stop it if we can?...", "In this case being the asshole isn\u2019t even relevant to me as protecting your sister from being murdered or assaulted is much more important. You can\u2019t make judgments when you\u2019re that drunk. She has no money and she can\u2019t even use her phone to call for help if needed."]}
