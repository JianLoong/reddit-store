She's fantastic and I see a great future ahead. \n\nEmily is an athlete. I don't mean professionally, but I can never keep up with her. She is insanely fit. \n\nEmily is extremely good at football. She doesn't play professionally on a team, but I, and many of my friends, can see her playing professionally on a team. She coaches a U19 at a popular club part-time.\n\nAlmost every Sunday, a small group of my friends and I get together to play football. It's very informal, anyone can join (even random strangers) and it's not meant to be serious. \n\nSince I started dating Emily, she has been joining us for our weekly Sunday matches. My friends like Emily; she likes them, and there's never been an issue with her joining the group. \n\nMy friend, \"Mark,\" and I have been friends since primary school. Mark and Emily have grown to be quite good friends as well. Mark has been dating \"Irene,\" for six months. \n\nI haven't really spoken to Irene much. But, Mark tells me that Irene does not like our little football games. She believes that they're \"childish,\" and \"low-class.\" Although Mark still shows up for games, I can always tell he looks a little distressed. \n\nAbout a month ago, Irene, told Emily that she was making her uncomfortable by playing football. Because Emily, on most days, is the only woman playing, Irene explained that Emily isn't \"respecting the boundaries of her relationship.\" Emily and I thought this was ridiculous, but Emily apologised but refused to stop playing with us. \n\nLast Sunday, Irene came to watch us play. We asked her, many times if she wanted to join, but she seemed content to watch from the sidelines. At one point, Emily and Mark accidentally bump into each other. They're both laughing and no one is hurt. \n\nThe moment Irene sees this, she storms up to Emily. She starts screaming at her, calling her terrible names, telling her not to \"mess with her man,\" and \"that she'll stay unmarried forever if she keeps acting like a man.\" \n\nAt this point, everyone is shocked and mildly uncomfortable. I go to Irene and tell her to \"fuck off,\" and to stop acting like a \"petty, stupid, lovesick teenage girl with no commonsense.\" \n\nThe moment I say that she immediately starts crying and takes Mark with her. Later that night, Mark texts me to apologise.

As for others telling you that you should have never said anything at all I will say that if no one ever points out someone behaving poorly they will never learn and just continue to behave that way.
