She starts screaming at her, calling her terrible names, telling her not to \"mess with her man,\" and \"that she'll stay unmarried forever if she keeps acting like a man.\" \n\nThis behaviour calls for being called out for precisely what it is. Vile, immature nonsense. \n\nEven calling it teenage lovesick ness is trivializing. I know a lot of teenagers more emotionally intelligent and less misogynistic than that. \n\n> At this point, everyone is shocked and mildly uncomfortable. \n\nIt is at this point (and honestly many, many times before this) that MARK should have stepped in. She never should have been at the game in the first place if he knew how she felt. He needed to either leave her or stop coming to football. It was cowardly of him to just pretend like it wasn\u2019t going to be an issue and let Emily take all the shit. \n\nIt never seems to occur to women like this to put the onus on their partner; they go after the \u201cother woman\u201d instead. Newsflash: if you don\u2019t like the way your man behaves around other women, you take that up with YOUR man. The other woman (in this case) ain\u2019t got nothing to do with you. \n\n> The moment I say that she immediately starts crying and takes Mark with her. \n\nJust to clarify: this was NOT the moment that the night was ruined. The night was ruined when Irene had a whole tantrum. Just because Emily didn\u2019t cry about it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not the victim here. \n\nAlso, he\u2019s a grown-ass man. She doesn\u2019t \u201ctake him\u201d anywhere. He made the choice to leave with her. \n\n> Later that night, Mark texts me to apologise. \n\nFirst, if he apologized for how she acted, that\u2019s bullshit. He should apologize for bringing her and putting everyone in this situation and not shutting her crap down earlier. Any apology for her actions should be coming from her. \n\nSecond, I sincerely hope that apology went to Emily first, since she\u2019s the wronged party here. \n\nThird, this should not have been a text afterward. He should have been the one to remove HER from the field, not the other way around. \n\n> A few of my friends tell me that I ruined the night and I shouldn't have said anything.\n\nOP, that is straight unfiltered bullshit.  IRENE ruined the night. And EVERYONE ELSE should have said something too. \n\nMy response to these \u201cfriends\u201d would be this:\n\n*Well, I think y\u2019all SHOULD have said something, so I guess we\u2019ll both have to live with disappointment.*\n\nMark\u2019s a big boy, and if he chooses to leave with her, that\u2019s his decision.
