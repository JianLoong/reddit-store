You tried to do a nice thing and greedy AHs came out of the woodwork.  I'd put my foot down on this.  Either half-brother comes by himself or the offer is cancelled.  Even if \"uncle\" pays for his own flight, you're going to be stuck with him and most likely end up paying for his entire stay.  Getting to know your brother is the goal of this trip - not providing a vacation for some 30 year old hanger on (wondering about this relationship).", "NTA You have no obligation to any of them to provide a free vacation.  You were being generous offering it to your 14 yo half/step sibling.  That said he may not be mature enough to fly internationally, alone.  These request should have come from an adult in his life, not him.  I see this as potentially financially abusing you and would say Hell NO, offer it again when he's of legal age.", "Nta. Your brother does not need an \"uncle\" to fly with him.  Either they are using you or he doesn't want to visit you alone. Seems sketchy. Don't fall for this scam.  You hardly know your brother.  Who knows what he or they are up to. I would cancel the whole trip.  Just seems dishonest.  Watch your back and your bank account. Criticizing you for saying no is manipulation and  big red flag. If they keep up the pressure wait till he is a few years older then make the offer again when they feel he mature enough to travel alone. You are opening yourself up to a lot of serious charges and blackmail taking a minor you really do not know into your home. Be careful.", "NTA. It is perfectly reasonable for a 14yo to have you pay for his flight. Why would a 30yo need to have his fare paid by someone else? Anyway, the purpose of the trip is for you and your brother to bond. A third wheel would interfere with that.", "NTA at 14 i flew from Canada to England by myself. The stewardess are great helping kids when flying alone", "NTA.\n\nJust say \"No, dude.  I can come visit you again, but I'm not interested in paying for someone else's ticket, or in having him stay with me for a week.\"", "NTA. It stinks, but wait until your brother is a legal adult in your country.  He can then fly on his own. When you go to visit your grandmother, take him on an extended weekend. Visit places within your home country.", "NTA fly put and fetch him.  On the way back he can go as an unaccompanied minor because he will know what to do.  \n\nDo not let them bully you into having an extra guest.", "NTA, but if somehow the older man came, too, wouldn't he then be getting in the way of your getting to know your brother?\n\nThey would be sightseeing or whatever in a new place and you would really be just a third wheel, which destroys the purpose of the trip. You can't expect this man to hang back unobtrusively. He'll simply take over.", "NAH, no.\n\nYou may have been adult enough at 11 to fly alone, but that doesn't mean your brother is at 14.

Most airlines will allow children as young as 5 to fly domestically (this is US) and may charge a fee to ensure that the child is not left alone in airports.   For international flights, the age is generally 12.  If the relatives in this case feel that his brother needs  someone to watch him, the OP can offer to pay the the airline to see that he gets to and from the gates safely.", "So your half brother's mom gave you the explicit ok to buy his flight?"]}
