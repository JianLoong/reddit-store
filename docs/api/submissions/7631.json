While financially my parents had always been secure, they believed (due to home prices being so high) it was time to sell their fully accessible home without having a plan as to where to live. Multiple family and friends questioned their decision but they still went ahead with the sale.\nUnfortunately, finding another fully accessible place to stay was as a hard as everyone told them it was going to be and they ended up moving into their non-winterized cottage. Their time spent at the cottage was secluded and far from safe and accessible. Over the year, my fathers health started to take a steep decline and ultimately he passed away this fall. \nInitially, I offered my mom to stay with me while she figured things out and grieved. It has now been several months and she has made no attempt to find her own place and in fact has basically moved all her stuff into my one bedroom lower floor condo. And not only that, she has taken over the bedroom and I am now sleeping on the couch. Any mention of potentially finding her own place is met with anger, resentment and passive aggressive tendencies.\nWe've offered to help her look but she refuses. She complains of not being able to figure out her finances yet refuses to let anyone help or know what her situation is like. I'm a 33 year old single female who appreciates her privacy. I\nwork full time as a nurse and just want to come home and relax in my own home. It now feels like I have regressed in having my mother there who treats me as if I'm still a child, questioning when I should leave for work, where I am at all times, who I'm out with etc. I love my mom more than anything but I feel like she is not getting on with her life and is now put my life on hold.

I understand the frustration of paying bills yet having to sleep on a couch in your own home. That's not cool at all. it also sounds like she has boundary issues and isn't understanding she isn't the boss of you just because she's your mom. You are a grown adult who works and provides for yourself independently. \nDo not feel bad about wanting her to move out. She isn't respecting your boundaries and taking away from your quality of life.", "INFO: Is your mom paying for any of the expenses? If so, what?\n\nNTA regardless.  You are entitled to enjoying your own space, and she is not entitled to treat you like a dependent child while living with you.", "NTA.  I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your father.\n\nYou are in a really tough situation.  It may be very very difficult to get your mother out of your home.  It\u2019s terrible that she packed it with her stuff.  \n\nIt sounds like the two of you would benefit from counseling to find a resolution.  In the US, many different professionals provide counseling, but for this situation an MSW would be most helpful as their approach is very pragmatic.\n\nYour mom should get a thorough examination and disclose to her doctor how much she is struggling to cope.  She could be experiencing depression or mild cognitive impairment. \n\nGood luck, OP.  You\u2019re going to need it!\n\nEdit to add:  Some of your mother\u2019s behaviors sound like the early stages of dementia, depending on how competent she used to be.  Poor decision making, struggling to manage finances, mood changes, inability to solve complex problems, secrecy, returning to behavior patterns from decades ago, etc.", "This is extreme, but it's a solution:\n\nIf you own your condo, put it up for sale and put in an offer on another place.\n\nIf you rent, when your lease is close to end, start looking and find another place to rent.\n\nOnce you made arrangements, give her a signed, printed document which states the date when you will no longer be in possession of the condo and provides official notice that she needs to move out by that date. This document should also specify that failure to comply could result in the landlord/new owner filing charges against her in addition to evicting her.\n\nAnd don't let her find out the address of your new place.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, that's rough tho.  If you can't get rid of her maybe you could just have her take over the lease and move out yourself.  Kind of a pain but if she's already taken over the space it might be less hassle in the long run.", "NTA. She's freeloading and taking over your place.\n\nFolks, this is why you don't let your parents move in with you. Better yet, don't let them visit at all. (Ideally they wouldn't even have your address, only a PO box.)\n\n>Any mention of potentially finding her own place is met with anger, resentment and passive aggressive tendencies.\n\nClassic entitled behavior. How dare you disturb her comfortable life (which she lives at your expense)?!\n\n>She complains of not being able to figure out her finances yet refuses to let anyone help or know what her situation is like.\n\nFor fear that you would discover that her finances would not prevent her from getting a place of her own.\n\n>I'm a 33 year old single female who appreciates her privacy.\n\nAnd your mom doesn't think you deserve any privacy at all.\n\n>It now feels like I have regressed in having my mother there who treats me as if I'm still a child, questioning when I should leave for work, where I am at all times, who I'm out with etc.\n\nIt's your life.

She wants to go back to what were, for her, the good old times. When she could control you and she was queen of the house.

It's clear that your mom is having a very difficult time transitioning into this new (and scary) stage of life, but that is now impacting your own well-being. You're not an asshole for wanting her to find her own place. If your mom truly has needs that prevent her from living independently, perhaps other family can help shoulder the burden?

Lawyer up and evict her if she won't go.", "NTA\n\nShe is your mother, not you child.   She doesn't get to take over your home and your life for as long as she wants.

If you have a good healthy relationship its not a bad idea to let your parents visit. In healthy households parents and kids will take turns swinging by to help each other out. They understand boundaries and can have talks if there are problems. Now I got that out of the way, lets move on to the rest of the points.\n\nI don't even have to do these individually because they can all pretty easily get lumped together. This woman's long term husband died SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. Not years. Months. In a time frame that is actively acknowledged as a heavy grieving period. This can also be compounded by the knowledge that her and the father making an ill advised decision may have actively contributed to his death. So now she has guilt compounding her grief. In situations like this people can often act out not for a power trip but genuinely from fear. She's afraid to lose OP. She's afraid she can't live on her own. If the father was generally the one to handle finances she can also be feeling deeply overwhelmed and trying to bury her head in the sand. \n\nNot everyone is some evil shrew looking to take advantage of any sucker that will let them. Sometimes its just people making bad choices because they are scared to do anything different.", "> why do you have to sleep in the living room when it\u2019s your house\n\nBecause if she didn't want to sleep on the couch then she should have gotten a 2 bed condo, but instead she made a poor decision like a typical immature child which is why she needs her mom to run things for her /s", "All this. \n\nNAH."]}
