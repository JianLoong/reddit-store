It\u2019s a nice place, but there\u2019s so many problems. One of them being the walls are practically paper thin, so I\u2019ve dealt with some pretty loud neighbors. Back in November, we had new neighbors move into the larger apartment next door to us, a couple with their few months old baby.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I\u2019ve tried to be as courteous as possible by making little noise in case the kid is napping. At night, I turn the TV down to a reasonable volume, sing during my afternoon walks, no arguing loudly, etc. But lately, I feel like the neighbors are trying to take advantage of our consideration. About a week ago, my mom was making dinner and she was frying it in the pans, and our neighbors came knocking on our door and told her to keep the noise down.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe told them she was in the middle of cooking dinner, and she would be done soon, but the neighbors just said, \"It better be soon.\" The second occurrence happened was when they came knocking on our door because according to them, I was \"shouting\" when really, I was responding to my teacher\u2019s question. (I\u2019m in homeschool) they bitched about it and threatened to report us to the office or security.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYesterday was when shit hit the fan. The night before, my mom asked me if I could vacuum while she was away at work, and I told her I would handle it. I started the vacuum around my lunch break in case there were other neighbors sleeping late, and not even a minute in, I heard the baby start crying. I then heard loud banging on my front door and when I looked through the peephole, it was the mother, looking beet red. I opened the door and asked her if she needed anything and she said, \u201cYou need to turn the volume down on that machine of yours!\u201d Uh\u2026 it\u2019s a vacuum. There\u2019s no volume button!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI tried to explain that to her, but she continued shouting. \u201cMy husband and I have been nothing but nice to you and all your family do is be loud!\u201d I lost it said, \u201cWE\u2019RE the ones who\u2019ve been nice to you! But the moment we go on about our daily lives, you start complaining! You can\u2019t expect the whole world to go quiet because you have a kid, so suck it up and deal with the noise!\u201d\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI shut the door and went back to cleaning. Later on, a few other neighbors stopped by and said they heard what happened and that I was being rude and bitchy. But when I told my parents, they both said they were on my side and that I was just doing my chores. I don\u2019t know, part of me feels guilty and I\u2019m scared that next time they\u2019re going to potentially get us kicked out for \"multiple noise complaints\".

You and the neighbors live in an apartment building with thin walls. Noises will be made and heard by all. That\u2019s just a fact with living with a bunch of people around you.

Before they report you for noise, report them for harassing.", "NTA. Turning the volume down on the tv at night and minding your voice volume make you a courteous neighbor. Expecting your neighbors to never cook or vacuum bc your baby might be sleeping is insanity. Kids need to hear noise like that anyway or they\u2019ll never be able to sleep through the night", "NTA. Call the office right away and get your side on the record. Also, get a doorbell camera so you can prove them coming over. If need be call the police and file a report.", "NTA.  You had to say something similar to what you said, so there's no need to feel guilty. I also don't think that there's any way for this to end amicably because of the frying chicken issue (I mean, seriously?!).   I would also stop tiptoeing around and let them adjust to level of noise you normally have.  In addition, any time they're too loud, document the date, time, etc. and report them so they'll also have multiple noise complaints.", "NTA - if they are so worried about neighbours making noise they need to buy a house and live in the middle of the woods or country. Life goes on. They are entitled and think that because they have an infant everyone around them should work around the child's schedule. The real world doesn't work like that. Let them make compaints, they don't have a leg to stand on and from now on, stop being nice. You're allowed to make reasonable noise until 11pm (here anyways), so watch your tv and live your lives and they can deal with themselves.", "NTA. Living in the apartment implies tolerating a certain level of noise, and vacuum during the lunch break does count as normal level of noise.", "NTA.

BUT, on private property the supreme court has consistently found that there is NOT an expectation of privacy for anyone but the person who controls the property such as owning or renting and only in regards to someone that has entered their property.
