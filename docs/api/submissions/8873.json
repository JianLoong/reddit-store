It\u2019d be one thing if they politely asked you to avoid vacuuming or blending smoothies or practicing saxophone during a certain hour of the day for the baby\u2019s naptime. That\u2019s the sort of reasonable neighborly compromise that it would be okay for them to ask for and kind of you to consider. But it\u2019s quite another to throw a screaming fit any time you make any sound at all. \n\nHowever, be warned. Even though you are 100% right, if your neighbors complain first and better to management, you might get screwed anyway. In one old apartment I had on a second floor, the woman who lived below me was like your neighbors. She\u2019d scream and bang on her ceiling any time I moved a muscle. No matter if I dropped something on the floor, if my cat jumped from the sofa to the floor, if I tiptoed across the place wearing socks on two layers of carpet, somehow she could hear it all and she would regularly catch me in the hallway to scream at me about harassing her. I quickly realized that it\u2019s really hard to prove a negative and how was I going to explain to the building management that I was *not* intentionally harassing this woman by living my normal daily life? I ended up moving because the place sucked in other ways too. But if I were you I\u2019d complain *now* to your landlord or building manager that your neighbor is regularly harassing you. Make a note of the date and time of every incident and what you were doing and send the manager a log of each one. That way, if your neighbor does eventually submit noise complaints against you, there\u2019s already a documented record that you\u2019re the one being harassed.", "You guys need to complain to the building about the harassment. Yelling at a kid for vacuuming in the middle of the day is obnoxious. \n\nComplain each and every time about the harassment. Stop opening your door to them.

Your parents should report them for harassing you and disrupting the quiet enjoyment of your home.", "NTA at all. You and your parents have been very considerate the whole time, even during normal hours. That is waaay more than needed and expected. You guys deserve to live in your place too. After all, you pay for it and have been good residents. Your neighbors are apparently entitled. They obviously took advantage of your consideration. I think you and your parents should inform your side of the story with your landlord/apartment manager, just in case so those neighbors can't paint you in a bad light. Though, I believe that you guys have the upper hand since you have been living there longer with no other complaints from other neighbors. \n\nAnd if those other neighbors stopped by again, explain your side of the story. Because again, you're only doing normal living stuff during normal hours. What else can they expect? We're living; not dead humans. Some people just have impossible expectations.\n\nAnyway, I know what you mean. Currently, I'm going through something like that myself, with my upstairs neighbor. At first, my husband and I were apologetic and accommodating so we tried our best to minimize every sound we made. But then, my neighbor took it too far with complaining about everything, like when we're cooking lunch, opening drawers, opening the door, opening the closet etc. She thinks we're doing this constantly nonstop when really, we only do it a few times. \n\nDamn, she would keep texting us and we would text back, trying to fix it, but we were also so confused because sometimes, we were just on our phones, laying in bed.

It felt like a slap to our faces because we really did try to be mindful of our sounds. It felt like she called us liars. Since then, we were like \"Fuck this, we'll continue with our normal routine (of course, being mindful of noise around 11pm-8am).\"\n\nWe ignore her completely and she tries to complain to our landlord, but our landlord is probably done with her bullshit complaints.

You are 100% allowed to vacuum your own apartment in the afternoon, or cook dinner for yourself at night. There are rules in every apartment contract about what level of noise is acceptable and at what point you have to be quiet, and there's NO WAY those noise rules are enforced for something like vacuuming after lunch. \n\nThese people are assholes (hey! there it is) and need to learn that the entire world doesn't revolve around their baby's sleep schedule. \n\nHere's a fun question - what if another couple moved in next to them that also had a baby?

They should also contact your management office to let them know of the issue, you very likely aren't the only neighbors being targeted. To reiterate, this is harassment by your neighbors and you'd be within your rights to report to the police, but start with your mgmt office. \n\nThe parents are also not doing their baby any favors by expecting and trying to force everyone to be quiet.
