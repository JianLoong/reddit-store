It's really dehumanizing to be essentially judged in worth based on whether or not you have children. He asked you your opinion on the will and you gave it to him. I totally get where you're coming from. Sure, it's nice that he wants to provide for grandkids but you're his child too. It hurts to feel picked over just because you chose a different lifestyle. In the same way people can judge you for not having kids, your sister could also be judged for having them if she wasn't financially able to provide for them (which doesn't even seem to be the case here). Your sister does absolutely sounds like an AH though with her rubbing that in your face constantly with snide remarks. If you wanted to be petty if your dad decides to stick with not splitting things more evenly, you can always alter your own will so that you could provide for someone else you feel who maybe needs it more. It sounds like your sister is set.", "NAH\n\nyou can ask. but i hope he cuts you off for being a gold digger.\n\nIve never asked my parents and only ask to fund their lifestyles. They wont let me of course lols.", "You've got to remember that your sister's kids are people. Her side of the family should get twice as much because there's twice as many of them. Also it's really up to your dad how he divides his money, don't make him spend his last years on a fight over money. YTA.", "YTA Firstly, you're always the asshole in trying to dictate how someone divides their money in their will, unless there's some sort of extreme unfairness taking place.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, was you mentioning that paying for his grandchildren's education is proof of how \"unfair\" things are. If you had kids they would have received the same. And that's not money going to your sister, it is going to her children. You do realize they're entirely separate entities, don't you?\n\nThere is no 50/50 in a situation where part of the inheritance is a home and the rest is cash. And it makes sense for her to get the house because your father wants it to stay in the family. \n\nYou are being petty and selfish. Okay, you brought up getting more of the cash because she gets the house, I could even sort of understand wanting to get a (smaller) property of your own in the equation. But you got your answer, and you need to drop it.", "YTA - I get what you\u2019re saying but the same time, he\u2019s not giving your sister more by paying for her children\u2019s college or giving her the house due to him wanting it to eventually go to his grandkids. He is giving stuff to his grandchildren, not your sister. \n\nSo, unless she is actually getting more than you, I would say it\u2019s his choice there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.", "Hate to say it but YTA, firstly your talking about your father dying and focusing on what you get from it rather then the loss of your father, it's also his money to do with as he pleases, be grateful you're getting something. Finally you admit yourself it's petty, why come on here from something you already know the answer to. Sorry but it seems pretty obvious even to you that you know the answer to this...", "I'm going against the grain and saying NTA.\n\nMany parents try and divide their assets evenly amongst their children. Your father is not doing that. He's giving your sister significantly more because she has children. It's of course his money, and he can do what he wants with it. But it does seem that he is favoring your sister heavily. Regardless of whether that is purely because she has children, or because he has always favored her over you, I think it's fair to be upset.", "YTA. You\u2019re going to be taken care of for the rest of your life, just not enough? You\u2019re in a unique and fortunate position, not everyone gets what you\u2019ll be getting. You sound petty, immature and resentful. It\u2019s your feather\u2019s money, he earned it, not you. Who would receive a an amazing gift and be jealous of an amazing gift someone else got? I hope there\u2019s some soul searching in your future. If not that, go earn more money on your own if that\u2019s all that\u2019s important to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's not giving his sister significantly more money, he's giving the money to her and her kids! There's simply more of them.
