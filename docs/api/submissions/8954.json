My parents excitedly started sharing arranged marriage proposals with me, after which I found one guy. He is nice, but talks really less, and his family, touchwood are all very nice. I have probably talked more with his parents 10 times than with him. The guy is preparing for an important exam so is rather busy which I understand. But I found he really doesn't communicate unless pushed and doesn't show much interest. I also don't have much in common. My parents and his parents agreed to the marriage and are planning it. I am well, to be honest, going with the flow, for my parents sake. But many times I feel sad that I cannot choose a free life. And the guy hasn't talked in a long while so I was just anxious and sad and binge eating a bit . My parents found out and now they are saying I am causing them to fall sick because of my behaviour, and bringing up every fault from 8 years . That now they might have to cancel because of my sadness and lose face in society and that i am the reason they are unwell, unhappy and cannot aspire for good things.

You are very young and have your whole life ahead of you. It sounds like if you go through with this you will be miserable. NTA but YTA if you go through with this.", "NTA give yourself a break! Do not marry this guy, he isn't interested in you. Go away from your parents for a while they're putting too much pressure on you, you are NOT the cause of them being ill. Don't settle in life, you only have one chance to live it!", "NTA. It's your life. Your parents can't rush your life just because they suddenly feel compelled to rush their's.", "NTA. \n\nMy first instinct is to tell you to stop the wedding and that your parents are AHs. But that would be insensitive to your culture and a long history. Since I'm not from your culture I can't relate to the pressure but also the incentives of arranged marriage. \n\nHonestly I can only imagine how you must feel right now and any advice I could give you would fall short on multiple levels.\n\nSo all I will say that your feelings are not your fault. Whether you chose to follow your parents wishes and your tradition or not is your decision but your feelings are completely valid.\n\nI hope that the situation will find a happy ending, whether that be with your betrothed/fiancee(?) changing after his stress has passed and you two finding happiness together or you choosing to find happiness yourself (hopefully with the understanding and support of your parents and/or other loved ones).\n\nBe kind to yourself and I am sure you will come to a good decision. I wish you all the best.", "**NTA**\n\nOh honey. I am not at all against arranged marriage, and I come from a culture where it also happens. And good arranged marriages can be beautiful, lasting, and even bring great love over time. But they have to be with someone who is WELL CHOSEN. And I think that's where the problem is here.\n\nThe fact that your chosen groom has been uncommunicative and disinterested is a big problem. And his studying for an exam is not an excuse. You do not need to share a lot of interests (sometimes that's actually a good thing, and can be a way to connect as you learn about new things from each other); and just being shy wouldn't be a problem. But his lack of interest and communication is a terrible sign. He should be looking forward to this marriage, to getting to know you (once his exam is done) and creating a life together. He should maybe even be excited about this. He doesn't need to be in love with you - he doesn't know you yet - but marriage should not be something he is indifferent to . . . you are about to build the rest of your lives together. And it is a terrible sign if he is acting polite but indifferent, because you need to be able to trust that he is going to bring enthusiasm to your marriage and invest of himself in it, emotionally. And that doesn't seem to be the case. You are right to be worried.\n\nYour parents are being unfair to blame or scold you or try to make you feel bad, because in an arranged marriage you have to trust them not to just pick someone out of convenience because they are in a hurry to get you married . . . you need to be able to trust them to choose the RIGHT person for you, and it doesn't seem like they are spending the time and care to do that. It's good that he has a nice family, but HE has to be someone you can live with, have children with, be a good partner and father.\n\nYou are NTA. Arranged marriage can work, but only if it is entered into thoughtfully, and it seems like your parents are rushing it.", "NTA- this doesn't sound like a good match. Your prospective husband has shown no interest in you or in getting to know you. You should sit down with your parents and explain to them that you want someone who actually wants to be a part of your life, not just shove you in a corner while he does other things. I'm not a fan of arranged marriages but I have know some people who had them and they worked out but they only worked because both people worked on the relationship and tried to be partners to each other.  Better to walk away from this one and try to find someone more in line with partnership.", "NTA. So I'm not Indian, so I can't provide you with socio-culturally sound advice, but I think you were right in telling your parents. \n\nWhile they are your family, it's your life. If you don't feel good about the path you're on, you should change it. I know it's hard to go against tradition and social expectations, but you need to look out for yourself.", "NTA. You should not be subjecting yourself to an unhappy marriage to make others happy. You deserve happiness as well.", "Nta. Meet the guy and talk to him clearly once.If u don't feel the connection end it Or atleast postpone. If it's really about saving face tell your parents to fake being sick and buy some more time. Also I would say share this on twoxindia sub. A lot of indian women there going through the same stuff can advice u better.", "Indian here. I am 51 and happily unmarried. I went through the same pressure as you and steadfastly refused to get married.\n\nEvery argument was met with - fine, if anything goes wrong or if I face any problems it'll be 100% on you guys. If my husband misbehaves, I'm going to call you. If my in-laws say something I'll put you on the line. If I am unhappy in my marriage for any reason you will have to leave your home, come to my house and sort out the mess till everything is resolved to my satisfaction. If you want me to get married to make you happy, it is your responsibility to make sure I am at least as happy and satisfied with my life as I am currently.\n\nSome useful comebacks for common complaints\n\nWe'll lose face - it'll be even worse when I divorce him  after a few months.\n\nSo and so's daughter is married/has kids  - isn't she the one with (abusive MIL/cheating husband/no support) there's always something. Is that what you want for me.\n\nYou have to make compromises - Yes, the compromise I choose to make is to be financially independent and live my life on my own terms.\n\nIs this how you repay us - yes, because this way I'm ensuring that when you are old and bed-ridden I can take care of you as you deserve and not depend on husband/in-law permission to even speak to you.\n\nYour mother's/father's health is suffering because of your stubborn attitude - no, it is due to the fact that they need counseling and therapy. I'm willing to locate a good therapist \n\nBut society - if at your age you do not know how to shut up busybodies who shouldn't be commenting on people's private lives, let me know I'll talk to whoever it is. Believe me they don't want this.\n\nAll of this assumes you are working and/or studying towards being financially independent. If you are not, then please just get married and have the regular average of two and half kids in three years.", "I can totally understand you. I myself being from India and in the same age group can see my parents getting worried and losing sleep due to me being unmarried. I have begged them to give me a year to get in a government job and they are really angels to allow me this freedom but still I feel guilty everyday when they have to hear taunts about having unmarried daughter in thier home. So, i can understand your parents perspective too. It gets difficult to live in this society..\nBUT, PLEASE PLEASE I BEG you. Don't marry this guy. Your parents are going to be unhappy later too if you are not happy in the marriage. No matter strict parents or not but ultimately they DO want your happiness.\n My very close friend got married too in similar circumstances, 2 years back and she is regretting now. Her husband is in government job but still preparing for civil services and doesn't give her time at all. And by time I mean emotional time. He is never available emotionally and one can't live with just money right. Her parents too are sad to see her sad now. And she can't even complain because you know in India, there is no things such as emotional availability. Everyone thinks she is lucky having well settled husband, living without in laws, having all facilities, servants but no one notices how she has lost her charm and happiness. \nSo please, don't marry this guy if you are having gut feeling that he may not be right for you. Your parents might be upset now, but once they see you really happy after marrying someone whom you really can see a future with, then your parents are going to be genuinely happy.\n \nSorry for such long comment but couldn't stop myself after reading this post after just having a talk with my friend where she was saying she feels so lonely that wants to go Himalaya leaving everything forever for some peace.", "NTA. Your parents are the AH. It's your wedding and it's supposed to be for YOU and your LOVER, not you and your parent's demands. They should be asking you if you're okay with it and respect you.\n\nForcing you into it isn't an arranged marriage but a forced marriage. Arrange marriage is letting you guys meet and if you dislike him, you get to choose to not marry him. Sort of like Tinder but with parents as the app. You're not facing a potential arranged marriage here but a forced one. Plus, they don't love you if they force you into it. You don't owe them anything. They chose to have you and you're their responsibility now, not you begging for them to \"sleep\" with no protection to have you. They're responsible for your happiness, not to make you miserable.\n\nWhat they did to you is guilt-tripping and manipulation. They're invalidating you. They're being evil. Don't listen to them. Don't do stuff for their sake. If they're happy but you end up being abused to the grave, do you want it? Will they be happy if you kill yourself because of the miserable marriage (they'll most likely talk shit about you tho)? If they're happy to see you abused, miserable, or neglected in your marriage, is it worth it? Absolutely not. They'll tell you to suck it up or else it's your fault. You tolerate abuse once, they'll do it again. Stand your ground, Queen.\n\nDon't listen to them. Stay single until you find the right man for you. Marry YOUR right man, not their ambition. If they die before you get married, so be it. You don't owe them a marriage and you don't have to get married just for the sake of it. If they fall ill because you're not married yet, it's their problem. They need therapy, not your wedding.\n\nThey're willing to hurt you and they're more than excited to do it for the sake of them seeing you get married. Throw your care out of the window. They don't care about you (in the context of marriage). They only care about themselves. They don't feel bad for you, so don't feel bad for them. They purposefully hurt you (invalidating, forcing, etc), so don't feel bad for \"hurting\" them by being honest and civil 'cuz you're not hurting them; their hurtful demands are the one hurting them, not you.\n\nDon't follow their forced marriage scheme and don't feel bad for them. Stand up for yourself unless you're planning on regretting your life decisions for the rest of your miserable life. Marry the right man you love and go live a happy life. Don't rush it tho. All the best, Queen. Stand your ground and reject their forced marriage plan. If they don't respect you, DO NOT respect and tolerate their **behaviour** (behaviour, not the person).", "NTA, societal and cultural expectation is an absolute nightmare and I feel for you.  However, what's much more important is that you clearly don't want to marry this man, he evidently isn't that interested in marriage either.  There's nothing wrong with refusing, it's 2023, anything less than full excited happiness from both parties (by which I mean the bride and groom, not any other family) should be the end of any arranged marriage conversation.", "NTA\nMy parents had an arranged marriage and are now divorced. If I'm being honest I have no idea how they managed to live together at all before I was born. On the other hand, my cousins' arranged marriages seem to be happy and successful.

Your parents love you but they don't know everything, this decision will change your life forever you should be happy with your marriage.\n\nTell then you love them, that you understand they are worried, but this decision is yours to make, because it's your life, it's your future.", "It seems to me that you grew up in a different culture. So I'm not going to judge as I don't know much about arranged marriages and Indian couples", "Better to break it off now before you have even met than divorce... you'll find your person.", "Arranged marriage works for some. But if you aren\u2019t sure what you want with your life. And it seems the man doesn\u2019t care. I think you were right to express yourself. We cannot always be perfect copies of our parents. This is your life. And yes you may upset them. But if you keep going now, in five years, will you find happiness?", "\"But many times I feel sad that I cannot choose a free life.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can. Please do and you'll do the both of you a favor NTA.", "NTA: When you are tempted to give in, try thinking about yourself in 3rd person. \"Does Sally want to marry Harry?\" If \"No, Sally does not\" it becomes easier somehow to stand up for yourself. I've been married over 35 years. Think about 35 years with this man. It's a big chunk of life. You need a partner with whom you can be free, be yourself, and want to share everything too.  Also, if you can't set boundaries at home, how are you going to fare in academia or research? You have to stand up for \"Sally\". You are her only hope!", "NTA\n\nIf the thought of marrying this guy is making you ill, don't marry him.\n\nI say this as a Muslim woman who has been in your position.\n\n Just ask your parents, do they want to be embarrassed now or 2 years down the line when you get divorced!", "I have nothing against arranged marriages but this is starting to sound forced", "NTA OP.  I've tried to scroll down as far as I could but may I suggest that the reason this man is uncommunicative is because he may be feeling the same as you.  Maybe he don't want an arranged marriage and is being pressured into it by his parents just as you are.  I don't know what your culture's dating ritual is but get him alone and ask him if his being uncommunicative is because he's feeling pressured to accept this arranged marriage.  If he is feeling like you, then you two must stand up for yourselves.", "I'm not going to pretend to know your culture, because i don't.\n\nSo take my \"advice\" as you see fit.\n\nBut if you don't want to get married, DON'T GET MARRIED.\n\nI will **never** understand arranged marriages, no matter what the reason is.\n\nThey would rather \"save face\" than have a happy daughter? F THAT.\n\nThis is YOUR life, do what YOU want.\n\nFuck the \"cultural norm\", be YOU!!!\n\nNTA and don't be one to yourself either.\n\nThem being unwell has NOTHING to do with you!!!", "You didn't make your parents sick. That's a manipulative tactic and you shouldn't fall for it. \n\n\nRepeat:\n\n*Your actions have no impact whatsoever on your parents health.*", "NTA. Girl you CAN CHOOSE A FREE LIFE.\nLeave.\nNow. Look up domestic violence resources, women's shelters, etc.\nYou do not have to say yes. You just go.", "NTA You're are the one who has to live with the other person for the rest of your life. Marriage is even harder in it than thinking of it theoretically. You are wise to back out.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you feel that you have to do an arranged marriage.  You have a long kid ahead of you so don\u2019t do it for your parents", "Excellent.  Thanks for your voice of experience.", "I know it's a bad manipulative tactic and yet I fell for it.", "I will try to convince them once again that I need time to know whether he is compatible.", "Exactly. Thank you for your support.", "I hope I have the courage to do so. Thank you for your reassuring comments.", "Thank you for your support. I feel ill because I don't know much of anything about the guy. That's all I said. I will try to convince them to give me more time.", "Yes I have told him that I need to talk to him separately to get to know him.", "Seeming nice is not the basis for marriage in the 21st century..move out, get a job, follow hobbies and meet people. Otherwise, go ahead and ruin your life.", "Thank you. I will try to convince them to let me get to know the person better."]}
