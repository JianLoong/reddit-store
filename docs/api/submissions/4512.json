But also understand that like some kids aren\u2019t very good at being left alone they weren\u2019t taught hyper independence and that teaching kids hyper self-reliant and leaving them home at a young age is bad for their developmental.

You leaving the house without another caregiver being present makes you the one in the wrong for a child being left home alone.

Again, though, your dad and stepmom are massive AHs and you should never have been put in that position in the first place. \n\nNext time, as others have suggested, get out before they leave. That absolves you of the responsibility for your brother. And if they leave before you realize it, pack him up and take him to wherever they are and drop him off.

But it sounds like your brother isn't used to being left alone, so it could have been a dangerous situation. My younger son at age 9 probably would have set the house on fire! All these people saying it's fine to leave a kid of 9 home alone clearly don't realize that it depends on the *individual* child; one can't make that a blanket statement.\n\nHad you thought of it, the best thing to do would have been to take him to the restaurant. Or have your BF come to your home and stay in. Your parents are definitely AHs for doing what they did and for not coming back home when you said you were leaving. They tried to sabotage you. I get it; I totally understand your point. You're not wrong there. But I don't think that situation was the most appropriate time to teach them a lesson. Tell them, though, that from now on you're not babysitting for free (or not at all), and they need to find themselves a babysitter.", "You're not wrong! That's why it's the \"eat shit\" option. It sucks as an option but it still counts.", "I mean, by the time they're 9 yo, usually they can stay alone by themselves for a couple of hours. And even with the kids who can't be fully trusted unsupervised, it tends to be more because you don't trust them not to mess up the house, rather than themselves.", "Personally? I would have packed the kid up and taken him to the restaurant. FAFO, enjoy your dinner with the company of the little hellion\n\nAlternatively, find another babysitter and make sure the parents get the bill no matter how much it is. Relatives or family friends, otherwise.\n\nNuclear option: call the cops and say it's child abandonment (or threaten to do at least) if they don't come home within X amount of time.\n\nLast but not least, accept you got fucked over and invite boyfriend over for a night in with the kid. Establish hardcore boundaries after.\n\nThere's a lot that can be done before leaving a 9 year old alone in a house. I still hold the parents accountable for the whole thing.", "Call the cops and let them know the parents have abandoned this kid without an adult", "Call CPS, don\u2019t leave the poor kid alone.", "Parents are still TA and still be furious at them, but switch to a movie night with the date, put the kid brother to bed at a normal time, still get some alone time and also learn if your date is a cool human being for adapting to a sucky situation? Is it OP's responsibility? Nope, but it's still pretty crappy to leave the kid brother home alone.", "I pay mine in ice cream, and fast food . Or cash whichever she asks for. And if she says no, for any reason, then I cart the little dude with me. Or I figure it out.", "Yeah, though the funny thing is if this was sibling just dropping niblings on someone in the same way we'd be seeing a ton of \"should've called cops and stayed long enough to report the abandonment.\"", "This is my take as well. Not every 9yr old is the same. Some could be trusted to be left alone, some could not.\n\nOp is an A for abandoning her brother. She should have stayed but then had a serious talk with parents when they got home and laid down clear boundaries on what will happen next time.\n\nParents are also an A for (I believe) lying and manipulating OP for a free babysitter, and for trying to force her to pay for something he broke. They're taking advantage of having another adult in the house unfairly.\n\nESH", "Which is only the parents fault. She gave them a courtesy of waiting for them. It\u2019s literally not her job to care if he\u2019s home alone or not.\n\nedit: fixed a pronoun", "And like others, I babysat my brother when I was 10.  So parent's left 10yo in charge of a 5yo, but a 9yo can't be left alone until stepmother gets back?

They could've been someone who's sat for them before that cancelled. Just saying. I'm on the ESH train too, but this is a plot hole, unless I missed something.", "It\u2019s not even her dad and stepmums 40th it\u2019s the stepmums parents 40th", "Not their Anniversary, step mom\u2019s parents.

It's not a huge difference, but it can be enough for some, depending on the relationship.\n\nLiving in their house, rent free?  Should've just sucked it up OP.", "Quite possibly there wasn't, but we can only speculate on that.", "Yeah that\u2019s pretty fair. My state doesn\u2019t have any unattended child laws so it was my first time hearing about it. From the post, it sounds like she did take his safety into consideration but it obviously wasn\u2019t her priority. I really only say NTA because I am so convinced that the parents never scheduled a babysitter and I might\u2019ve done the same thing in OP\u2019s shoes tbh.", "This isn't about legality, it's about morality and what op should have done as decent human being.", "I bet there was never a babysitter and they planned this out.", "My guess is they never hired a babysitter\u2026", "They tricked you. \n\nBut since there was a child endangerment in this story you and your parents are TA.", "Lmao what a load of bull, they could have just asked \"the babysitter\" to come earlier", "It doesn't sound like this particular 9yo is used to being left alone.  If his family doesn't consider him old enough yet, they might not have taught him the basic \"home alone safety\" stuff.

She can't trick you into free babysiting then get mad when you find a solution for her problem.", "Damn she can\u2019t have it both ways haha she sounds very unreasonable.

Even if her parents are being irresponsible, she should have never left her brother at home if she cares about his safety. Nine year olds are fairly smart most of the time, but they\u2019re still children and it\u2019s not safe to just leave them alone for hours with no instructions on how to stay safe (e.g, lock the doors, don\u2019t answer the door, don\u2019t play with the stove, don\u2019t mess around with the cleaning supplies) and even then it should only be a last resort to leave a child that age home alone", "Right?

As long as they have a way to contact someone in an emergency, and know how to cook and fend for themselves ( my family to be fair does a lot of fend for yourself nights growing up so I was good at this too, as an ingredient household food got interesting lol ), as well as understand to keep the door locked and not to unlock it, as presumably everyone that needs one has a key, it\u2019s good from what I understand. The step mom gave OP the task way back. Op said no and made plans the same day the parents did. The parents were not going to an emergency where OP would have to cancel last minute, they were going to a dinner. WHY is it right for them to get to attend their function and force the 19 year old to babysit, which is child care, for FREE, when they are just as capable of coming home.\n\nI understand what everyone is saying about Op not paying rent being a factor, and helping out family. Really, I do. But this isn\u2019t OPs child. It\u2019s not an emergency or one time thing. This is expected of OP unfairly. If they were making money from it every time it would be a job. And if it deserves to be payed to others it is a job. And if it is frequent it is a job. That\u2019s why most family\u2019s do allowances, and yes that doesn\u2019t apply to some things as you get older, like doing dishes or trash, but when it\u2019s not something you contributed too then it is. As harsh as it sounds OPs mom gave up the house with the agreement OP could stay there if she wanted. She or he DOES get a free pass as they said they pay for all their own things. And in edition OP did not make the choice to have a step mom, nor did they have the choice to be a sister. Which is fair.

There were other options - they *sucked*, but they were options.
