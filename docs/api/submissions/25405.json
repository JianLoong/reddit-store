Your family can be immature all they want, but they're wrong and incredibly selfish to make it about David and your Mom instead of Maddie and her spouse on THEIR WEDDING DAY. \n\nWay to go, David. Letting everyone down again.", "What? He is a no show her whole life and thinks his mere presence is enough to walk her down the aisle?\n\nYour mom and brother can pound sand.", "You didn't \"usurp\" David place at his daughter's wedding. He gave up his place there years ago when he decided he'd rather do something else than be her father and you stood up for his kids in his place.\n\nHe- and the rest of your family- should be thanking you for being such a great uncle that you were happy to spend weeks practicing a dance with your niece so she could have the \"father-daughter\" dance of her dreams, when she couldn't even trust that David would turn up to her wedding. You're the person that she trusts to be there for her- genetics doesn't make a father, actions do that.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe day is Maddie's and her partner's day and no one should be dictating how it should be run.  If she chose you to walk her down the aisle and you agreed, you're the one to walk her down the aisle.\n\nAt this point I'm going to say something that may be a surprise, your brother is not the AH here.  Guy is a dick, but by the sounds of things wasn't going to be there.  Since he was convinced to turn up by your mother, I'm expecting that he thought he would walk her down the aisle, do a dance, and all the other fatherly duties of a wedding.  Your mother who convinced him is the AH.  Otherwise he would have stayed away and the day would have just passed him by.", "Nta No do not give in.", "NTA. There's one person whose feelings matter in this situation and It's Maddi. Your brother and your mom can just sit and cope, dude doesn't get a prize because he barely managed to show up one time in his daughter's life.", "If he wanted to be treated as a father, he should have showed up in his kid\u2019s life like a father. NTA, but mom and him are for sure.", "NTA. Madfi didn't want him.", "NTA but your mother and brother are TAs.", "NTA.   \nTell family your brother's effort was self serving, and he is an absentee father, your mother is wrong for trying to force this and bro would not have shown up if he was rousted from a stupor.   \nThen tell everyone how you have been their REAL father. The bride asked you, and you did the right thing.", "NTA. David isn't Maddi's father, he's her sperm donor. Sperm donors don't trump fathers (or father figures) when it comes to walking the bride down the aisle.", "The problem is that we didn't ask her. She was happy to see him in the pew at the church but very surprised that he bothered. Maybe we should have asked her.", "And he was sober enough to not trip over his feet!", "She's not a child.  If she wanted you out and him in, she would have said something. Again, the REAL problem is that he simply showed up unannounced without any communication.  His mother let him feel like a hero for that, when neither he nor she had enough manners to communicate. You are not the problem here.", "NTA.  The important thing is what Maddi thinks which I bet is that it is you.  Your brother, mom, and all the flying monkeys can kick rocks.  You are the dad.  I am a step-father and it sickens me to see that David thinks that showing up for his bio daughter's wedding is \"an effort\".  Like you, there is no effort in this, it's something that is just done period.  Sounds like Maddi chose the correct person and I hope you have a blast filling in for the grandparent role if and when Maddi and her partner choose to start one.  Your brother and mom will be missing out on that relationship as well.", "nta, lbr the reason he probably came in the first place was for the booze.", "NTA, but, YWHBTA if you asked her that question. She asked you. It's her wedding, so it's her choice. Your only choice was doing it or not. If he is upset, he should start caring about other people's feelings.\n\nYou maybe even should have taken her aside and let her know that she didn't have to dance with him if she didn't want to and you would stand by her side if that was her decision. Because it seems like she offered to dance with him just to defuse the situation. Which, she should not have to do at her wedding.\n\nCongrats on your nieces wedding. I think she is blessed to have a wonderful father figure like you in her life.", ">Now he is spreading old rumors about the three years that Meredith lived with my wife and I.\n\nTell him if he had been an actual father, his ex and his child would not have had to live you & your wife. I'm so sick of men who do the bare minimum, sometimes less, yet they should be applauded when they make an appearance. \n\nPersonally, I'm sure many know the truth and by creating this drama, he makes himself look & sound like an AH. All those who are siding with him-ask them were her was for all of her other important moments? If they think he should have walked Maddi down the aisle, they should have \"helped\" him by making sure he was an active and present father, inside of a drunk who preferred the bottle and diving in Indonesia over his child. F David and your mom and all the rest. \n\nNTA", "NTA, he just wanted the credit for being a good father. He wasn't so he shouldn't get to show off that \"achievement\".", "NTA, your mother ruined her Granddaughter's wedding for the sake of her failure of a son. She chose to hurt everyone in the name of a man who had to be forced to go. She owes your niece an apology, a public one begging for forgiveness. I would make sure she is not invited to any future weddings, as she is not capable of not making it about her.", "NTA - but your brother sounds like one.  Glad you were there for her!\n\nMy uncle was supposed to walk me down the aisle as well and I could not have been more pleased.", "Not sure what part of 'it's her wedding\" people aren't understanding. If your mom hadn't nagged your brother, he wouldn't have shown up. Let them complain all they want. You did the right thing by your daughter because that's who she is, YOUR daughter. - NTA", "NTA. It kills me when parents do nothing for years and then act shocked when they're not put on a pedestal.", "NTA he was trying really hard to make his daughters day all about him. You on the other hand made Maddis day all about her and her husband . It\u2019s a no brainer", "Nta. It always frustrates me when folks parent like they haven't read the Little Red Hen. Then again, considering how absent they are, they may never have. Glad you were there for Maddi, and that she has you, her Mom, your wife, and her new step-dad in her corner. Perhaps your Mom shouldn't feel so accomplished if she only wants her son there for the pictures, not the children.", "NTA the sperm donor can go pout about it.", "They are the ones with the problem- not you! You are NOT the ASS for walking her down the isle! \u201c She asked YOU\u201d He should be happy you were there for her.., (if he really cares for her, and considering his history)", "So when did Maddie learn her father was there? Before or after she walked down the aisle?", "NTA and do not let anyone make you feel bad about this. Maddi asked you to be there for her and you were, she knows she can rely on you, she knows you love and support her, she loves you and wanted you to be the one to take this roll, neither you nor Maddi did anything wrong. David doesn\u2019t get to peace out and selfishly do his own thing for most of his daughter\u2019s life and then pop back  up when she\u2019s an adult who can take care of herself and pretend to be the proud father who had anything to do with it. Anyone who is giving you grief can go kick rocks.", "My brother reunited with our father very shortly before his daughter was baptized. On a whim our father became the godfather. Now my brother hates those pictures because as it turns out: unreliable fathers cannot be counted on long term.  \nYou saved her weddingpicture grief, im sure of it", "What bothers me about is you not addressing his injuries. I\u2019d normally say NTA, but it doesn\u2019t seem fair to be angry at someone who has experienced that trauma and yet wants to be there for his daughter. Your anger could have been placed in a supportive role.\n\nNot a popular opinion, but you\u2019re the AH. \n\nYTA"]}
