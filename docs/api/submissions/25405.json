Guy is a dick, but by the sounds of things wasn't going to be there.  Since he was convinced to turn up by your mother, I'm expecting that he thought he would walk her down the aisle, do a dance, and all the other fatherly duties of a wedding.

The important thing is what Maddi thinks which I bet is that it is you.  Your brother, mom, and all the flying monkeys can kick rocks.  You are the dad.

Like you, there is no effort in this, it's something that is just done period.
