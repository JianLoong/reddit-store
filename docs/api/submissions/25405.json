Your family can be immature all they want, but they're wrong and incredibly selfish to make it about David and your Mom instead of Maddie and her spouse on THEIR WEDDING DAY. \n\nWay to go, David. Letting everyone down again.", "What? He is a no show her whole life and thinks his mere presence is enough to walk her down the aisle?\n\nYour mom and brother can pound sand.", "You didn't \"usurp\" David place at his daughter's wedding. He gave up his place there years ago when he decided he'd rather do something else than be her father and you stood up for his kids in his place.\n\nHe- and the rest of your family- should be thanking you for being such a great uncle that you were happy to spend weeks practicing a dance with your niece so she could have the \"father-daughter\" dance of her dreams, when she couldn't even trust that David would turn up to her wedding. You're the person that she trusts to be there for her- genetics doesn't make a father, actions do that.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThe day is Maddie's and her partner's day and no one should be dictating how it should be run.  If she chose you to walk her down the aisle and you agreed, you're the one to walk her down the aisle.\n\nAt this point I'm going to say something that may be a surprise, your brother is not the AH here.  Guy is a dick, but by the sounds of things wasn't going to be there.  Since he was convinced to turn up by your mother, I'm expecting that he thought he would walk her down the aisle, do a dance, and all the other fatherly duties of a wedding.  Your mother who convinced him is the AH.  Otherwise he would have stayed away and the day would have just passed him by.", "Nta No do not give in.", "NTA. There's one person whose feelings matter in this situation and It's Maddi. Your brother and your mom can just sit and cope, dude doesn't get a prize because he barely managed to show up one time in his daughter's life.", "If he wanted to be treated as a father, he should have showed up in his kid\u2019s life like a father.

Madfi didn't want him.", "NTA but your mother and brother are TAs.", "NTA.   \nTell family your brother's effort was self serving, and he is an absentee father, your mother is wrong for trying to force this and bro would not have shown up if he was rousted from a stupor.   \nThen tell everyone how you have been their REAL father. The bride asked you, and you did the right thing.", "NTA. David isn't Maddi's father, he's her sperm donor. Sperm donors don't trump fathers (or father figures) when it comes to walking the bride down the aisle.", "The problem is that we didn't ask her. She was happy to see him in the pew at the church but very surprised that he bothered. Maybe we should have asked her.", "And he was sober enough to not trip over his feet!", "She's not a child.  If she wanted you out and him in, she would have said something. Again, the REAL problem is that he simply showed up unannounced without any communication.  His mother let him feel like a hero for that, when neither he nor she had enough manners to communicate. You are not the problem here."]}
