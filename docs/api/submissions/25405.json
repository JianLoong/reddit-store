Everyone can be a father, a dad\u2026 it\u2019s a whole different thing", "NTA\n\nWho is more important? Maddi or the rest of your family? \n\nMaddi wanted this. Maddi and her brother see you, OP, as a father. So all the others can go get lost.", "INFO: what does Maddi think about the whole situation ? Does she think you're an asshole ? Because at the end of the day, she's the one who gets to decide whether it's what she wanted or would've changed her mind.", "Nta, your brother is a dipshit.", "If she really wanted it, she would've said something. If she was perfectly happy to have him sit in the pew, it sounds like to me she didn't want him walking her down the aisle.", "Lol she is old enough to talk", "[removed]", "INFO.\n\n>he has an accident on a quad that left him in a coma for three months\n\nSo does that mean he has a traumatic brain injury? It is Maddi\u2019s choice who gets to walk her down the aisle and you\u2019re not the AH for accepting. However, it\u2019s downright monstrous how many people, especially in the comments, are demonizing David as if he was just simply an irresponsible person when it sounds like he\u2019s genuinely mentally ill.", "who wedding is it? Unless you really don't want to?", "INFO - who was David before the TBI?\n\n\nIf David was the father figure Mattie deserved, then N A H - mourn the death of the David you knew, and my heart breaks for him, you, Mattie, and his people. The old David is simply gone and the new David is, clearly, not the same. This is an extremely confusing emotional dynamic and well beyond Reddit's pay grade. It's OK to be upset with new David but I promise you he didn't want it like this any more that you did. Never forget that.\n\n\nIf the quad accident had nothing to do with his current behavior, then N T A. David was an asshole before the quad accident and continues to be one. But I don't think this is likely, because otherwise you wouldn't have mentioned a three month coma.", "NTA, there's more to walking the bride down the aisle than just being at the church on time that day. HER wedding plans had been set long before the wedding day.", "He's brain-damaged. Not sure if normal standards of behavior should apply.", "> TBI\n\nFully agree - need more info on who old pre-TBI David was. It's clearly the most important factor here and you're the only one that mentions it.", "She's not a child, dude. If she wanted you to sit down and smile, then she would have said that. \n\nShe told him where to sit because he wasn't a participant in her life, barely an observer by the sounds of it. So she was very kind to have him sit so close.", "> The problem is that we didn't ask her. \n\nThere is no problem. Stop second-guessing yourself and her. If she had ever wanted him to do it, he would have been asked. Don\u2019t let your mother and brother\u2019s nasty comments turn your head.", "It would have been good idea to ask her, but if you ask her now what she would have answered, she would probably answer she wanted you", "He\u2019s so brain damaged he could go live in an entirely different country with no outside family help or wife, and spend his days diving. Uh huh.", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage\n\n-------\nEdit:\n\nPoster that I replied to has blocked me and left a comment about me being a troll and attempting to make a diagnosis of David's brain injury. Let me say I am doing no such thing, only providing evidence that brain injuries are extremely unpredictable, can result in emotional problems, impulse control problems, and a million other cognitive issues that don't necessarily mean someone can't go \"diving.\" It's idiotic to think that being able to go on a trip is indicative of a fully functioning undamaged brain when, by the OP's own words, David is unable to hold a job and has addiction issues. For fuck's sake he was in a three-month coma!\n\n>You\u2019re claiming he has a frontal lobe injury based off the information they provided. That\u2019s a big stretch to defend a guy you don\u2019t know. Bless you\u2019re heart, what a troll\n\nPhineas Gage is simply an example of an individual suffering severe brain trauma and coming out of it alive, and by some standards, functional - but damaged - emotionally, socially, professionally. Clearly David and Phineas Gage are not the same person and do not have the same injury, and to claim that is my position is a clear straw man.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man\n\nI am not claiming David is made of straw. But perhaps the poster I am replying to needs that to be made explicit. /u/surly_grrrly"]}
