If someone interrupts you, but is *completely fine* with you interrupting them, they aren't being rude. They just come from a culture where that's the style. \n\nPople from that cultural style would *rather* you cut them off if you already know what they are about to say so that you both can move on and they will extend you the same courtesy. Interruption is a form of engagement and showing excitement - if you wait for them to finish talking before saying something, they think you are probably daydreaming about something else instead of listening. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone interrupts you and gets huffy with you when you interrupt them, then they are being rude and think their contribution to the conversation is more important than yours. If someone interrupts only you but not other people (e.g., a man who will talk over women but not other men), then they are being rude and don't value you. If someone interrupts you to change the topic rather than continue the conversation, they are being rude by disregarding what you are talking about. Those people absolutely should be called out for their rudeness. \n\nNot all conversational styles are the same and not all interruptions are equal.", "I\u2019ve never seen that label before but my family does this.

The trick Is to continue talking even as they interrupt you.\n\nThen say. Sorry I wasn't listening. I was finishing what I was saying. Can you repeat what you were saying?\n\nDo it until they get annoyed enough to stop interrupting you.\n\nEdit:\n\nIf they dont want to repeat themself, or say that you should had been listening.\n\nSay 'oh okay I guess it wasn't that important then'", "To be honest (social circle with tons of neurodivergence so possibly not applicable in a neurotypical setting) in my fairly extensive experience that simply doesn't work. If someone's doing it accidentally its because they don't realise in the moment that you're not done talking because they're so focused on what they want to say, and if they do it deliberately they're so inconsiderate that a gentle conversation afterwards does nothing. \n\nWhat I HAVE found works with accidental interruptions is to have that outside conversation and agree upon polite language to correct it in the moment.\n\nSo unless he's never told her before that this bothers him, although he could have picked gentler language, the in the moment call out could well be necessary", "take notes.", "I just take my medication instead.

It\u2019s NOT because I think what I have to say is more important or particularly fascinating, I just latch on to something someone says and feel compelled to engage with it. It\u2019s taken me my whole life to be aware of the impulse and control it. I\u2019m better than I was, but I still have to think about it- even at 43.", "I do think it's rude, but at the same time, a lot of people don't even realize they're doing it. Not everyone perceives situations the same way, especially if someone is neurodivergent. So if this happens with someone you *care* about, not some rando on the street, yes I do think it's a good idea to explain calmly that it bothers you (again, the person might not even realize they're doing it). My best friend from childhood did the interrupting thing a lot and once she realised she worked really hard to change that habit. People aren't always AHs on purpose.", "Mrs buttcrack send me", "Hard to say without being there. On the surface, this sounds very benign so Im inclined to say NTA. But you couldve come across overly harsh and your joke couldve not fit the vibe of the conversation, even if she was interrupting. Generally, its better to not embarrass or reprimand your SO in front of others. I would\u2019ve spoken to in her private about it.", "If this is something that happens normally, and you have brought it up with her in private with no change, than NTA.\n\nShe may feel embarrased, but so were you.

This is my biggest pet peeve - as an introvert who already doesn't talk a lot, being talked over when I do talk is infuriating. After a few times, I sat down with my husband (away from any people or moods) and just explained how it made me feel. He apologized, and started being much more considerate/aware. Even now, when we're in a group and someone talks over me, he'll wait until they're done talking, pointedly look at them then me and ask, 'what were you saying?' He's a gem.", "NTA.\n\nIf people don't want to be called out for it, then don't do it. Simple.", "NTA at all. I HATE being talked over as well. Pisses me off no end when people do this.

You\u2019re 100% correct, it\u2019s better to help your SO save face around others and talk to them in private. If its a reoccurring thing, there can be a cue you develop to help her with conversational boundaries that wont involve embarrassing her.

I bet this gaslighting person is the type to accuse others of gaslighting HER when called up on it", "True, but for some of us it is such a long-standing bad habit that actually, an in the moment reminder is pretty effective, if the other party is ok with it. I know I do it, I try not to, I'm unlearning a lifetime behaviour, and it's a long journey. A snarky/funny remark is quite good for my personal process.", "This is so true. My husband was a serial interrupter, because he grew up with 2 loud siblings, and 2 loud parents. It\u2019s the only way he gets a word in with them. (I usually don\u2019t, I was raised as an only and it makes me uncomfortable to interrupt)\nWhen we were first dating I talked to him about how I wasn\u2019t being heard because he would always interrupt. Now if he\u2019s getting too bad about it I gently say his name and ask to finish my original sentence. It\u2019s way nicer than when I would either sit in silence after he took over the convo, or when I would talk over his talking over me. Less anger and annoyance.", "Study math and science all of the time.

Internalized ableism is a thing.\n\nTelling someone they should be embarrassed by a health issue they struggle with, as the other commenter did, is in fact ableism. People can only do their best - adhd is a spectrum so for some people their best will not be perfect. They do not need to be shamed for that.

We are extremely good at compensating for our nuerospicyness, and women are largely told to sit down and shut up by drs. \n\nIts worth thinking over and having a look at other symptoms of adhd to see if any of the others fit.

Was she given the opportunity to talk too?\n\nMy neighbor gets mad when I end up having to interrupt her, but that's the only way I ever get a word in.", "NTA.\n\nMy husband does this.

If the collaborative discussion leads to agreeing on a reminder as a tactic then that's all good, but doing it out of nowhere isn't ideal.", "I didn\u2019t say sternly means snapping or annoyed. I said that the use of \u2018sternly\u2019 means that it was said in a way that was not simply conversational. Normal conversation isn\u2019t stern. Stern is being authoritative and/or paternalistic, which are not appropriate attitudes to take towards a romantic partner - they are not a child or a dog."]}
