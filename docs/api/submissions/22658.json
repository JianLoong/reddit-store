If someone interrupts you, but is *completely fine* with you interrupting them, they aren't being rude. They just come from a culture where that's the style. \n\nPople from that cultural style would *rather* you cut them off if you already know what they are about to say so that you both can move on and they will extend you the same courtesy. Interruption is a form of engagement and showing excitement - if you wait for them to finish talking before saying something, they think you are probably daydreaming about something else instead of listening. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone interrupts you and gets huffy with you when you interrupt them, then they are being rude and think their contribution to the conversation is more important than yours. If someone interrupts only you but not other people (e.g., a man who will talk over women but not other men), then they are being rude and don't value you. If someone interrupts you to change the topic rather than continue the conversation, they are being rude by disregarding what you are talking about. Those people absolutely should be called out for their rudeness. \n\nNot all conversational styles are the same and not all interruptions are equal.", "I\u2019ve never seen that label before but my family does this. The first meal my spouse had with us together was very overwhelming for them. But it\u2019s normal now, they still think it\u2019s funny though. They just speak loudly when they want to be heard.", "My boyfriend's family is the same. At a table with approx. 8-10 people there are at least 2-3 different talks simultaneously on different topic and the people engaging with each other don't nesseccarily sit next to each other and people pop in and out of topics all over the place. \n\nIt's a bit exhausting, but they are overall lovely people.", "i knew there was a term for it but i couldn\u2019t remember what it was. both sides of my family are like this and a lot of my friends are as well so it\u2019s perfectly normal to me. i have to really be mindful when i talk to people who don\u2019t communicate that way", "I stopped talking in front of someone who did this. It makes you feel so small.", ">but if this happened to me without any prior discussion, i would have been really embarrassed and upset like your wife\n\nYou should have already been embarrassed about your \"chronic\" interrupting", "\u201cBasic manners\u201d is subjective depending on a multitude of factors.

Idk if I\u2019m neurodivergent but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, autism and adhd run in my family. I have a habit of getting really excited about a conversation and interrupting, but usually only to add something small like one or two sentences, and I always try to apologize after if I notice it, but honestly it can be really humiliating to be reprimanded for it because I\u2019m just trying to show my interest in the conversation. \n\nMy boyfriend and I discuss it in private and he\u2019ll say \u201cyou cut me off\u201d if we\u2019re chatting at home and I do it, and I\u2019ll apologize and let him continue, but I think if we were in public and he said \u201cHey. I\u2019m talking\u201d sternly (which he has never done), I would probably get really upset too because it would feel like the equivalent of \u201cbad dog!\u201d And I\u2019d feel humiliated like I now have to apologize and stand there quietly waiting for permission to speak. Honestly I\u2019d be worried that people around us would think he was abusive. \n\nI understand that sounds dramatic, but that\u2019s how it can feel sometimes, especially when you have a past where people would snap at you for everything and you lived in fear, like I have PTSD from an abusive male so if my boyfriend snapped at me and like sternly scolded me in public I would probably just shut down or start crying because I\u2019m aware I interrupt people and I don\u2019t want to and I don\u2019t want to upset people or be rude, but I do it accidentally and it can be really hard and unfair to be humiliated for something you\u2019re already ashamed of (as long as you\u2019re trying to fix it, like I am). \n\nI\u2019m going to go with ESH/NAH because there isn\u2019t enough info to know if gf is trying to improve on this but I feel like the public scolding may have been a bit much especially if she did it by accident.", "I\u2019ve done that. \ud83d\ude02 When my mom was on meds for cancer one of them made her talk and talk and talk and talk and talk\u2026 She knew she did it, though, and I was good natured about it. Eventually we developed a hand signal so I could clue her when we were out in public and she was doing it to someone else.", "NTA, but also being adversarial isn't a great way of handling it.\n\nTalk to her about it not in the moment. Discuss both why it bothers you, and also her say of why she feels the need to do so. \n\nI dunno, maybe she's had to fight to be heard so it's become a habit? \n\nCome to an understanding of each others perspectives and work out how to resolve it together.", "Do you want to dunk or do you want a healthy conversation dynamic with your wife?

One of my downfalls is that someone will stop talking, I'll jump in to respond, and...they were just taking what feels like a looooong pause, so suddenly they're talking again and I just interrupted them. I've had to consciously make myself remember to wait with some people.", "Just wanted to agree with everything you're saying. The mention of it getting worse around her family raised my suspicions here, and I do hope OP thinks about it in general. I'm from an area/culture that's really good at overlapping communication but also have family members that will rudely interrupt, and part of joining the family and conversations is learning to tell the difference, in the same way that I have to take care not to overlap with my in-laws because they don't talk that way.", "Very good post. I'd also add that some neurodivergent people have difficulty figuring out when someone is done talking.", "Right, my husband is an overtalker/interrupter, because in his family that's the only way to ever get a word in.\n\nMeanwhile, I can't think straight in all that, and I lose my train of thought if I'm interrupted. I feel rushed, even though I know I'm not rambling, it's just that everyone's basically hopping around at me. \n\nSo at home we have a much calmer, give and take conversation style.\n\nWhen we're around his family, it's back to the rattle and clatter, and I mostly zone out (it doesn't help that I have APD and my brain processes the overlaps as gibberish). \n\nIf I do jump in, and he interrupts me, I might mention it to him in private later. I wouldn't call him out in front of his family, that would feel like airing dirty laundry.\n\nOP needs to have a private chat, not a public call-out.", "Yes I do this with my SO who constantly talks over me. I have calmly addressed it, asked why they do this, explained why it bothers me and for a short period of time they are cognizant of it but it repeatedly happens.

Not sure what your point is but unless you are talking over someone to point out there is a fire, it is typically rude to do so.", "While I can understand the struggle, being neurodivergent is not an excuse to be rude. It informs the behavior, and it can certainly be a reason to extend more kindness and patience, but it is something that the neurodivergent person needs to work on. I have ADHD, as do my dad, sister and brother, so I can empathize.

The spellings are all simplified (g instead of ch, etc) and it can make reading hard (at least, as an afrikaans-speaker trying to read Dutch), but in terms of spoken language it's closely enough related that it's quite easy to understand each other.  There are some parts which have diverged enough for Dutch to sound like gibberish and afrikaans has a lot of adapted English words and a lot of obsolete (in Dutch) words, but it's still easy enough to figure out meaning within context.  A fair comparison is speaking English with someone from Shakespearean times.\n\nAs an interesting side note, languages diverge strangely - there's another variant of Dutch that's basically identical to afrikaans (I think Finnish?) in spite of developing a few thousand miles away and another one that's understandable to Dutch people but gibberish to afrikaans-speakers that developed within a few hundred miles of the other one."]}
