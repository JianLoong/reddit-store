How does one mind ones own business, when one cannot even eat life sustaining food, without constant shaming comments?\n\nPlease elaborate on how she, the OP, needs to not bring up food, so that she can avoid being bullied and abused by her step dad, for existing and trying to live?\n\nAre you a man? I ask because I am a woman, and my entire life, no matter the situation, it was on me, the little girl, the teenage girl, and the woman, to fix the emotional issues the men around me have and force onto me.\n\nThe step Dad has issues and he's forcing them on OP.", "Respecting elders.

Sometimes we respect them when they are wrong.\n\nYou can respect someone and still tell them you don't like when they make comments that negatively affect you. Saying \"please stop commenting on so-and-so\" and \"I don't like it when you joke about this, I'd like it if you stop\" is a polite and respectful way to assert your boundaries and express your feelings. If OP said \"shut your trap,\" you'd have a point, but it sounds like OP has been very respectful in her approach. \n\n>For example, is it the man's house? Did he buy the food etc? These have to factor in. \n\nNot really? Just bc it's his house doesn't mean he has the right to make comments on what other ppl eat inside the house unless they're making a mess and don't clean up or something like that. But the amount that ppl eat or what they eat isn't his choice to make. Even if it was his food, unless OP was wasting it by throwing away a lot of food all the time, there should still be no reason to make comments if he knows her past struggles and how it makes her feel. \n\n>That being said, on this topic they are both better off leaving the issue off the table, so to speak. Respectfully disagree. Mind their own business on the topic of food. If that makes sense.\n\nIt doesn't. I'm not sure what you're suggesting. The solution is for stepdad to respect OP's boundaries and not make comments that upset someone he loves, which isn't agreeing to disagree. I'm not even sure what that means in this context. Are you saying the stepdad should be allowed to keep making comments and all OP can do is ignore him? Bc that's not a healthy way of dealing with this situation.", "Yes that is what I'm saying. Take it and be silent. Deal with it. Otherwise chip in on rent, water, heat, electric, groceries  mortgage, taxes, maintinence and emergency expenses. Or you know, move out and be an adult who eats what they want. That's called respecting your elders and being an adult.", ">Otherwise chip in on rent, water, heat, electric, groceries mortgage, taxes, maintinence and emergency expenses.\n\nWhat if OP is already doing this? \n\n>That's called respecting your elders and being an adult.\n\nSo you disagree with the fact that politely telling someone to stop a certain behavior that upsets you is respectful?"]}
