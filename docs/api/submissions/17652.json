My stepdad and I typically get along pretty well and I\u2019ve grown to see him as a father figure since my actual father is pretty toxic. The only issue I\u2019ve had with my stepdad is that he likes to make jokes about my food.

Last night we were all sitting on the couch eating dinner. Upon sitting down he said \u201call the meat on that plate had better be finished\u201d and I simply said \u201cit will be\u201d and ignored him. When I was cleaning up I still had a bit of potatoes left. Not much but more than I had room for. He starts joking about how important it is to eat the whole potato and I reached a point where I was just tired of the food jokes and said \u201cplease stop policing my food\u201d. In the past his jokes have been similar or aimed at me not having enough on my plate. He yelled that he\u2019s not policing my food and stormed out of the room. He was slamming cabinets on the kitchen afterward. I don\u2019t think it was wrong of me to say something and stand up for myself but I\u2019ve never seen him react this way.

Like out of concern over your ED, or fear of something happening, he is super tense about it and pushing things to try and prevent something from happening.
