My stepdad and I typically get along pretty well and I\u2019ve grown to see him as a father figure since my actual father is pretty toxic. The only issue I\u2019ve had with my stepdad is that he likes to make jokes about my food. I\u2019ve struggled with ED in the past and don\u2019t find those jokes funny and I\u2019ve told him i don\u2019t appreciate them several times previously. Last night we were all sitting on the couch eating dinner. Upon sitting down he said \u201call the meat on that plate had better be finished\u201d and I simply said \u201cit will be\u201d and ignored him. When I was cleaning up I still had a bit of potatoes left. Not much but more than I had room for. He starts joking about how important it is to eat the whole potato and I reached a point where I was just tired of the food jokes and said \u201cplease stop policing my food\u201d. In the past his jokes have been similar or aimed at me not having enough on my plate. He yelled that he\u2019s not policing my food and stormed out of the room. He was slamming cabinets on the kitchen afterward. I don\u2019t think it was wrong of me to say something and stand up for myself but I\u2019ve never seen him react this way. AITA?\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve read through a lot of the comments here and just want to say thank you for the support. I want to clear up that this sort of behavior isn\u2019t normal for him and that it\u2019s mostly been in the last few months while he\u2019s been working 70-80 hour work weeks. I understand that him being stressed is not a justification but I do feel I should add it in there as it may be the main thing that has caused the behaviors. I have decided to stay at my friends tonight, give him some space, and will return tomorrow evening. My friend is going to help me write a letter to get out all I need to say so that maybe not being able to interject he will get the message. Thank you again for the support and allowing me to be part of your community.

How does one mind ones own business, when one cannot even eat life sustaining food, without constant shaming comments?\n\nPlease elaborate on how she, the OP, needs to not bring up food, so that she can avoid being bullied and abused by her step dad, for existing and trying to live?\n\nAre you a man? I ask because I am a woman, and my entire life, no matter the situation, it was on me, the little girl, the teenage girl, and the woman, to fix the emotional issues the men around me have and force onto me.\n\nThe step Dad has issues and he's forcing them on OP.", "Respecting elders.

If that makes sense.", ">Respecting elders. Sometimes we respect them when they are wrong.\n\nYou can respect someone and still tell them you don't like when they make comments that negatively affect you. Saying \"please stop commenting on so-and-so\" and \"I don't like it when you joke about this, I'd like it if you stop\" is a polite and respectful way to assert your boundaries and express your feelings. If OP said \"shut your trap,\" you'd have a point, but it sounds like OP has been very respectful in her approach. \n\n>For example, is it the man's house? Did he buy the food etc? These have to factor in. \n\nNot really? Just bc it's his house doesn't mean he has the right to make comments on what other ppl eat inside the house unless they're making a mess and don't clean up or something like that. But the amount that ppl eat or what they eat isn't his choice to make. Even if it was his food, unless OP was wasting it by throwing away a lot of food all the time, there should still be no reason to make comments if he knows her past struggles and how it makes her feel. \n\n>That being said, on this topic they are both better off leaving the issue off the table, so to speak. Respectfully disagree. Mind their own business on the topic of food. If that makes sense.\n\nIt doesn't. I'm not sure what you're suggesting. The solution is for stepdad to respect OP's boundaries and not make comments that upset someone he loves, which isn't agreeing to disagree. I'm not even sure what that means in this context. Are you saying the stepdad should be allowed to keep making comments and all OP can do is ignore him? Bc that's not a healthy way of dealing with this situation.", "Yes that is what I'm saying. Take it and be silent. Deal with it. Otherwise chip in on rent, water, heat, electric, groceries  mortgage, taxes, maintinence and emergency expenses. Or you know, move out and be an adult who eats what they want. That's called respecting your elders and being an adult.", ">Otherwise chip in on rent, water, heat, electric, groceries mortgage, taxes, maintinence and emergency expenses.\n\nWhat if OP is already doing this? \n\n>That's called respecting your elders and being an adult.\n\nSo you disagree with the fact that politely telling someone to stop a certain behavior that upsets you is respectful?", "NTA\n\nYour stepdad is being abusive. \n\nTell him he is being abusive and that you are working with your mental health team and doing what you are supposed to be doing.

I'm sorry he's acting like this. :/", "NTA. I have a serious problem with foods. I have fear of eating anything new, because of my many allergies(I've gotten Anaphylaxis reaction a couple of times) so i religiously check everything i eat, ask questions on what's in it, read the labels and things like that and my family makes a lot of comments about it.\n\nAlso, his violent reaction really worries me.... Are you safe?", "NTA. Keep standing up for yourself and calling him out on bad behavior. He may be more dense than malicious, and embarrassed at being corrected by you. He'll get over it.", "NTA.  You should not be treated that way by anyone.  If he didn't know about your ED history, would he be harping on anything else?  \n\nPersonally, I would find a way to not eat in front of him any more.  I would rather eat cold cereal in my bedroom alone instead of being harassed by that person.  That is just me; I am very touchy about my boundaries.  I have a mother (that I really love) who can occasionally be very toxic.  I have had to go NC a couple of times in my life to convince her that she had to stop XYZ in my presence.  \n\nI simply do not buy into the \"we're related so you have to do XXXXXX.\" NOPE.  My mother, and frankly other relatives and friends have realized now that I am in my 50s, that I cannot be pushed beyond my limits.  I suppose I think that quid pro quo matters in daily life.  If you are good to me, then I am good to you.  If not, I choose to leave the vicinity.\n\nI wish you the best and I believe you are correct in your thinking.", "NTA, but he kinda is, but it sounds like he's really concerned just doesn't know the right way to go about it.  I mean it sounds like his reaction to you having an eating disorder to to go overboard in forcing you to eat, which is not helping you at all.  Maybe you two should have a frank conversation about what will help you.", "NTA- It\u2019s never wrong to stand up for yourself.", "NTA it sounds like he has some issues that need to be worked out. I feel like sometimes adults have a hard time with their children needing boundaries. Not commenting at all about your food is one of yours.", "Tell him you were joking.", "See this is where I\u2019m confused. His biological daughter has similar issues and he\u2019s respectful towards hers", "Politely \"telling\" a parental adult in their own home to stop speaking on any subject is rude and entitled. Yes. I disagree with that.\n\nOne would be more polite in asking said adult to stop a certain behavior and then respecting if the answer is therefore No. That's what OP could try as a 22 yr old adult. Keyword here being, ask vs tell.\n\nAlso if OP is already paying their way, I still would favor being silent and ignoring the topic.", ">Politely \"telling\" a parental adult in their own home to stop speaking on any subject is rude and entitled. Yes. I disagree with that.\n\nIt's not just \"any subject\" though. The stepdad is making unnecessary comments about OP's eating habits, something that doesn't affect him or the house. It's not like OP's telling him to stop talking about his work or the day he had or something else that doesn't affect her. Why is it disrespectful to ask him to stop making comments about herself just bc she's in his house? If he was making comments about her body, would you feel the same way simply bc it's in his house?\n\n>One would be more polite in asking said adult to stop a certain behavior and then respecting if the answer is therefore No.\n\nSo you don't think it's disrespectful of *him* to be making hurtful comments to his stepdaughter? You don't think it's disrespectful to repeatedly make comments that hurt a loved one instead of stopping when you ask them to?
