I found out a few days after being unwell that I\u2019ve contracted covid and so had my partner whom I live with. We\u2019ve been isolating ever since we found out. I think being in the final trimester of my pregnancy coupled with Covid has just really drained me mentally and physically and as a result I\u2019ve not really been on social media and communicating with friends and family other than my parents who live abroad. My best friend who also lives abroad has known I\u2019ve been unwell as I made her aware last week when it was taking me ages to respond to her messages - mostly memes and just frivolous stuff on Instagram dms. She hasn\u2019t really checked on how I was doing until today when she popped up asking me how I was, I told her I had covid and been rather unwell but before I could say much else..she responded with how she\u2019s come down with a cold which has apparently been spreading in our hometown and she\u2019s trying to get before before her boyfriend\u2019s birthday party this weekend. She then went on to tell me how she was juicing to try and get better so she could attend said party. I was a bit annoyed and stopped responding because I feel like she is being really self-involved and has not even bothered to ask how me, my partner and baby are doing and has made everything about her. Whilst I am sorry she is unwell, I can\u2019t help but find her to be a bit tone deaf\u2026.she has a habit of diverting conversations towards herself and her problems and normally it doesn\u2019t affect me as much but I just expected she\u2019d be a bit more compassionate seeing as I\u2019ve not only got covid but am also heavily pregnant. She was in the same city as me a month ago or so and I went to visit her at her family home, they have two floors in their flat and when I asked ti use the bathroom she instructed that I use the one on the lower floor. Normally this would not bother me but the stairs in her home were rather steep and narrow and made me really nervous as I am pregnant and had also been complaining about achey joints that evening. I just feel like she seems to be unable to spare a thought for me in my current circumstances on more than one occasion now and I\u2019m wondering if I will be an AH if I try to confront her about it.", "created_utc": 1678840741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rge4q/wibta_if_i_confront_my_best_friend_for_lacking/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Soft yta", "Maybe I'm missing something here because all the comments are faulting the OP. I've read a lot of Reddit posts where pregnant women use pregnancy as an excuse to avoid anything more strenuous than breathing, and I always side with those criticizing the entitled pregnant person. This one seems different, but please correct me if I'm wrong. I'd appreciate it (as long as it isn't too snarky).\n\nThe OP got Covid while pregnant. I know quite a few people who got Covid who *weren't* pregnant, and every one of them was exhausted, some to the point where they weren't even able to make phone calls. And pregnant women who get Covid in tend to be more severely impacted than those who aren't. If a pregnant friend told me she hadn't returned my call because she'd had Covid and asked how I was doing, I'd say, \"Oh, I've got this  stupid cold, but oh, my God, that's nothing like having Covid! Are you getting better? What does your OB say?\"But *OP's friend didn't even let her get as far as saying she had Covid.*\n\nAbout the stairs: of course pregnant women are fully capable of using stairs. I had to climb lots of stairs both at home and at work both times I was pregnant. While pregnant, I worked full-time, did all the shopping, cooking, and cleaning, and generally acted like I wasn't pregnant. I'm no hot house flower. However, I'm short, and my pregnant belly really threw off my balance. REGULAR stairs were fine, but narrow, shallow stairs? Oh, hell to the no.  I can about guarantee that if I'd tried to use those stairs, I'd have fallen. Did I mention I'm a klutz? \n\nAnd haven't we all had friends like OP's? If you call and ask, \"How are you?\" you get 20 minutes on her hangnails, her SO's sinus problems, and her dog's peanut butter addiction, but if she thinks to ask about you at all, she interrupts three words in to talk about herself again. \n\nOP should not confront her friend. She should let it and maybe the friendship go.", "Honestly OP just do it. Based on your post and your responses it's seems to me that you want to, and are just trying to justify this to yourself.  If this does make you an AH I don't really think it would make you a big one.\n\nI'm not really sure you are the AH here but I don't really think this is the best place to ask. Reddit generally does like a bad guy to pick on, and being selfish in this case seems to be moving that spotlight to you. I'm not sure being selfish in this case is wrong. \n\nFriendships are two way streets and if you feel like you are not heard by this friend it's ok to say something to them about it. It's not unreasonable to want your friend to care about the goings on in your life but it might be unreasonable to expect it. Some people are just narcissistic without malice. Sometimes these friendships aren't for everyone.", "[deleted]", "NTA but some advice going forward, never ask Reddit about a scenario where you dared to want more than the absolute bare minimum", "i\u2019m going to go with yes and no based on how you approach them. \ni\u2019m going to assume prior to your pregnancy that this is how this friend normally acts? i too have friends that can make any situation about them, hell they even made my breakup about how bad their last breakup was and how i was \u201clucky\u201d mine wasn\u2019t bad. sometimes you want people to check up on you and care about you, and when they don\u2019t it\u2019s a reality check. you probably didn\u2019t feel so afflicted by it when you weren\u2019t sick and pregnant but now you\u2019ve had a dose of how this is going to go from now on. \nyou can decide to confront her, but also be prepared for her to double down and complain that she was just explaining her life experience with you, and trying to relate to you. she may also understand what you mean and change the way she behaves, although the second seems less likely. but also be prepared that if the behavior is a pattern, it\u2019s probably not going to get better when you give birth.", "NTA, but then I don't think anyone needs to be labeled an asshole here. \nI get where you're coming from, I have friends like yours.

Making you go downstairs to use the bathroom was super shitty I agree, but could you have left something out by chance, like was the toilet broken upstairs?

If you bring this up to her, you will definitely come across as being dramatic and petty.

So you have to stop yourself from spreading your (potentially damaging) reactions all over the place. \n\nThis is the point when you have to realize that not all friendships will survive your pregnancy. It\u2019s a really hard truth and it sucks. But the reality is that your friend just doesn\u2019t get it. She doesn\u2019t understand what you\u2019re going through. And there\u2019s really no way to get her to understand. You should prepare yourself for the real possibility that she\u2019s not going to be understanding when you have an infant, a toddler, a 6 yo, etc. And also know that if she doesn\u2019t show any real interest in your child, your friendship likely won\u2019t survive because at some point that will hurt you deeply.

And you\u2019re right in saying that In the past it never bothered me as much, to be honest it hasn\u2019t gotten to me whilst I\u2019ve been pregnant too for the most part..it was just today where I think the straw finally broke the camel\u2019s back.", "Thank you for this..I can\u2019t help but feel everyone on here is judging me a tad for just having wanted my friend to care about me for a second. We always talk about her and what\u2019s going on in her life and I don\u2019t actively try to get attention ever and deffo not since I\u2019ve been pregnant as I\u2019ve been super private about it. But she\u2019s one of my closest friends and I guess I kind of expected her to care a bit more when I told her I was really unwell and she knows how far along I am in my pregnancy :( I hope you and your baby are ok nonetheless and yes..we just have to accept some friendships and people for what they are I guess.", "Yeah it\u2019s been a sad few hours..I\u2019m about to put my phone down and cuddle up to my snoring partner for comfort :(", "The ops or people replying?", "Omg you deffo made me laugh a little with the common cold being more traumatic comment. You\u2019re quite right about the situation, she\u2019s deffo be a good friend at many points but is definitely also the kind of person who is able to make everything about herself somehow. So whilst I will probably not go so far as to terminate the friendship, I\u2019ll just need to adopt your approach moving forward a bit more.", "Lol saying you\u2019re having painful knees isn\u2019t saying you need the restroom on the level you are on.

Maybe there was a clog or the chain needed fixing - you don\u2019t know", "Have most times you guys have talked is it mostly about being pregnant and your baby?", "OP just because you are pregnant doesn\u2019t mean that everything has to be about it. She asked how you were doing you responded that\u2019s that she kept the conversation going while you sat there being pissy about her not further questioning how you are doing and how you and your husband/baby are doing. Instead of doing that you could have kept the convo going.", "And you could have added to your end of things. That happens a lot where we are texting or messaging back and forth and ask questions etc. not just about one of us or vice versa we both \u201ctalk\u201d about things and share experiences or stories. I have no issues telling my friends what\u2019s happening etc and asking them or listening to them etc.", "It\u2019s a text message. She can\u2019t actually interrupt you. She can only respond to things you\u2019ve said. If you decided not to respond after she told you she was also sick, that\u2019s on you. I\u2019m sorry you have COVID while pregnant but it sounds like she\u2019s been the one trying to keep contact and you\u2019ve been the one ignoring her and now she didn\u2019t say exactly the thing you wanted her to say and you\u2019re mad. \n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if you lose her completely as a friend. But maybe that\u2019s what you want.", "She's trying to let you know she can relate to your situation. You are sick, what a coincidence, she is sick and worried about missing a big event for her boyfriend.

That's normal conversation for friends.", "You asked them how they are and are upset they proceeded to tell you how they are\u2026", "I think somehow the pregnancy hormones are affecting how you think of your friend too. Your pain and feelings are valid, but a strong communication is needed.", "Okay I understand that but why not talk to her about that? She may not realize what she\u2019s doing. Transparency and being kind when you do it is probably the answer, if she\u2019s your friend she will realize her misstep", "As opposed to how you wanted the whole conversation to be about yourself?", "You literally say she popped in to see how you're doing. Then say she didn't bother to ask how you're doing....which one is it?", "\"How could she make the conversation about her? Doesn't she know  it should all be about ME?!\"", "Um no I had covid three times and never had one symptom so it's not odd because most people go unaffected.", "Once again.

You just want an even friendship where you are cared about and valued by her the same way you do for her. Also friends should show a bit more interest when something big is happening for each other.\nI could have written parts of your post and reply myself so I totally get it. I have thought before about politely saying to my friend that it makes me sad that she seems to almost ignore my sons existence. In the end i decided it wasn't worth it as theres no point in making someone show they care. \nShe is due to give birth this month, the petty part of me wanted to ignore her pregnancy, birth and baby, but that's just not me. So I will continue to be myself and accept that she is herself. \nAs an example of this friend, she stayed with me for almost 2 weeks and barely acknowledged my son, it really hurt, and still does. It felt like he was this unwanted elephant in the room. \n\nThank you, my son is happy and healthy, his smile makes me feel happy when I'm down. \nAll the best for the rest of your pregnancy and I hope you recover from covid soon.

It felt like a scene from the help.", "To be honest, I generally avoid conversations about my being pregnant and or the baby unless someone asks me about it or it\u2019s my parents or partner\u2019s family.

Nice bullshit there.", "Three times? Sounds like somebody doesn't know how to wash their hands~", "I say in my post that I am really ill.

I really try to be there for my friend with regards to everything she goes through in her life. When she and her bf were on holiday and had an argument, I didn\u2019t not go to sleep until I knew she was ok. When she was in town and fell ill, I made sure to go to her home to spend a few days with her so she wasn\u2019t sick and alone. Hell, when she had covid (a couple years back - I was not pregnant), I put my health at risk to go stay with her until she was better so she wouldn\u2019t be alone. So I guess just this one time, I wanted it to be about me but according to everyone else on here, I\u2019m a Total demon for that!! I thank you so much for your empathy though..it has made me feel loads better. And being really unwell and preggerz is so scary, especially with covid where you literally cannot go to a hospital or doctor\u2019s to have your baby checked :(", "wtf. haha. this has nothing to do with emotional intelligence and common sense. \n\nbeing able to communicate your needs in a clear manner however does.", "Sure.

Maybe it\u2019s a cultural thing, idk.", "Personally I think it would\u2019ve been quite imposing for me to outrightly I could not use a specific toilet seeing as it was her house, not mine. Instead, I expressed my concern with the stairs being steep and how they were bad on my already aching knees. In my opinion this was a less intrusive way to conveying that I would\u2019ve preferred to use the restroom on the floor of the apartment we had been on.

I understand they have their own lives and i have mine and at the end of the day I feel comfortable enough to turn to them when I need them. Comfortable enough to ask to use a certain bathroom if I need to. \n\nWhat people here are saying is that you haven\u2019t /didn\u2019t even do that to begin with.
