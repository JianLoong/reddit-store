You just filed, you aren't divorced yet. You have primary custody of those kids only because he isn't in the family home ATM. If you don't have a legal reason to keep him out, that can change. \n\nCustody will be decided during the divorce.

That is a HORRIBLE thing to do.\n\nIf you want to have a divorce party, do it AFTER it's finalized.

My father was and is an awful person, and I\u2019m sure my mother celebrated privately when she finally separated from him and managed to keep primary custody despite his constant threats. That being said, if my siblings or I had been involved in the planning of a party to destroy the reputation of my father it would have seriously hurt all of our perceptions of everyone involved. It\u2019s one thing to sit your kids down and discuss clear abusive behaviors if you\u2019re worried about them becoming the victims. It\u2019s another thing to parade your joy around and talk about how absolutely awful their father was, joyously reveling in the fact that they will now only see him under your new custody agreement. In fact, had I been in your kids shoes, I probably would\u2019ve actively chosen to side with my father in the hopes of regaining some stability. \n\nYou can deal with this however you want behind closed doors, but involving your kids in this way will only cause more problems down the road. \n\nI also suggest you hold back on this type of posting on your Facebook. It takes 1 second to screenshot it and send it to your ex. He can then take that screenshot into court and use it to prove that you are alienating him from his children by painting him in a bad light and therefore should not be the custodial parent. You might have primary custody now, but once you get into the nitty gritty of things you could lose out on a lot based on your public post about this ex-bashing celebration.", "I can't say who TA is without knowing why it's such a relief.

Let them be mad, and enjoy your party. Also, I assume your kids are too young for social media, and you definitely need to leave them out of anything related to your divorce, as they shouldn\u2019t be involved with adult business", "YTA- remember, your children are half of this man you are disparaging, publicly. There are little eyes on all you do. Be mindful of this.\n\nThat said, divorce is hard. Good luck to you.", "YTA\u2026. You are trash talking the father of your kids. Keep your bullshit private. Completely unnecessary and childish to be posting about \u201cthe party of the century\u201d. You have no respect or the slightest consideration for your children. Grow the fuck up.", "YTA", "NTA I would just block them.", "Are you joking!?! Yes YTA. Did you forget you have children caught up in the dumpster you're setting fire to?", "Bit pathetic. Grow up.", "YTA - what the fuck is a \"personal page\" lmao", "Lol my mom did this, be prepared for your kids to go NC with you in the future<3 YTA for including them in this. Its fine to have a divorce party- *but including your kids* is classless indeed.", "Yikes, poor kids.", "I know a lady who painted \u201cjust divorced!! Honk bc I\u2019m divorced\u201d messages on her car and then drive that thing around town. She used it to pick up her kids in the carpool lane. It was so embarrassing and cringey.\n\nIf you celebrate something like that, so it privately. YTA.", "YTA, don\u2019t involve the kids. Keep the divorce party to close friends and family and not post it all over the internet", "YTA. I'm thinking I found the reason for the divorce...", "YTA.\n\nWhen you \u201csay whatever you want\u201d You better be prepared for others to do the same. What shitty behavior.", "YTA.  This is not as \u201ccool\u201d as you think it is and your kids will remember how petty you were during this tough time in their life\u2019s.  Shame on you.  Divorce your husband but have some empathy for the family your children are losing.  Good grief.", "YTA", "YTA, that is your kids father", "YTA. You have children. Don't be that person that talks crap about their dad. Be better.", "Woman scorned. YTA and so are the laughing gf's\nZero class posting the kids pic.", "Yta.  You basically failed at something (which is also hurting your kids) and are celebrating it.  Unless he was abusive or something, it is really tacky.", "YTA. Yikes. Your poor kids.", "YTA. What kind of narcissistic fantasy is a divorce party?", "YTA. This seems like truly trashy behavior to me.", "Exactly!!! I wouldn\u2019t put anything like this out in public that can be used in the divorce.", "That\u2019s not a real thing", "I knew my parents hated each others guts. And they both tried to weaponize me against the other. The divorce was a long time ago. And I\u2019m still in therapy over it. I don\u2019t think people like OP get just how much this mindset affects kids. Even if one of the parents is a truly awful person, it still majorly fucks with you.", "It absolutely is. I\u2019ve seen judges swap primary custody because of it. They do not take it lightly.", "Not anymore, you aren't.", "ESH, leave the kids out of it. Y'all both need to learn to coparent peacefully and it seems like y'all are off to a horrible start. Evident by discarding anyone with a \"positive opinion\" because you want a negative hateful echo chamber. Grow up.", "well, i mean that's fairly public in regards to who you wanted to see the announcement, considering your Ex's family is likely to take his side.", "YTA. Celebrate all you want, I don\u2019t think anyone cares about that. The problem is that you announced it to the internet with a picture of you and your poor kids, for all to see. Leave the kids out of it. What a way to scar them whenever they see that post, and they will, or someone will mention it to them. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re also talking about this in front of them and saying negative things about their other parent which is one of the most unhealthy things you can do for them. And ultimately, it\u2019s just gauche to post a divorce celebration invitation to your Facebook, which no matter what you think, will live on forever in the ether, in the screenshots people took, in the minds of everyone who saw it, and embarrassed your kids in the process without even asking their consent to post their photo alongside this celebration post of yours. Check in with your kids because they likely aren\u2019t nearly as excited as you are about this. Divorces are hard on kids, you should be more sensitive to their feelings. You could\u2019ve avoided all of this by using discretion and inviting close friends to a gathering outside of the home (away from the kids\u2019 safe space), but instead you chose to be really loud about the whole thing and likely upset your kids even more than they already are. Don\u2019t think just bc you can\u2019t see their pain that it\u2019s not there. Ignoring it doesn\u2019t make it go away either. They\u2019re probably hiding it from you bc you\u2019re being so insensitive and over the top about your excitement, that its probably making them feel uncomfortable coming to you. I get being excited to enter a new chapter in your life and that\u2019s great, just leave your kids out of your tasteless big ideas and consider your children and how your actions affect them from now on. YTA.", "Tacky and trashy as hell.  I'm going to make assumptions that you got married and had kids young and never had a chance to mature into an adult.  Have fun pathetically pretending you're 20 again.", "\u201cLeft my husband, had primary custody, and throwing the divorce party of the *century*\u201d nobody talks like this unless they\u2019re bitter/mocking.", "Oh it *absolutely* is. The comment on some other poster's divorce donuts being bitter is absolutely the husband.", "Completely agree.  If the wife was so happy to divorce she would have shared the \u201cwhy\u201d", "Same, nothing would have made me happier", "I felt the exact same way as you when my parents got divorced, but I still hated getting caught up in their petty shit like this.", "Primary, not Full. and that can be subject to change in the future. While i'm lucky that i don't have any children with an Ex, i've seen plenty of experience up close to know co-parenting is either very smooth or hellish with no inbetween, and it all entirely depends on whether your Ex wants to be a thorn in your side or not, and there is little you can do alleviate that pricking even if you have primary custody.\n\nPutting aside the urge to be petty and bash your ex isn't as cathartic following a rough split, but you'll thank your past self for it later over and over considering this man will be involved in your life for as long as your kids are involved in your life. Set boundaries but try not to fan the flames, and especially don't drag your kids into your feud. If your kids learn to resent you for it, they will run straight to him and leave you behind.", "Like 99% of women get primary cuz they are the moms. Does t really say much and you sound very petty.", "OP coming from a family of divorce,, your allowed to not like your ex partner but you better keep it to your damn self. These kids are a lot more receptive than you think. Your kids should not be at this party for even a second.", "It\u2019s wrong to involve your kids.  How do you not see that?  YTA", "To quote someone else, \"classy\"", "Involving your children is just disgusting. Do what you want but don't involve them.", "OMG that might honestly be the worst logic I've ever heard even in this sub....  Just for that YTA.  with everything else, mega AH", "Why wouldn't you be friends with his family? Welllll to start with, ya just pissed them all off by gloating on FB about divorcing their loved one and getting primary custody", "With this stunt? You sure as hell just did.", "This comment right here has me 100% convinced it\u2019s the ex husband. \n\nPost is to vague.", "This is 100 percent the husband.", "My goodness you sound like a child", "If you're being serious, then you have a fundamental misunderstanding of how this subreddit works.", "It\u2019s quite literally made up and not recognized by any psychologist.

I was anticipating a whole paragraph of awful things the ex-husband did that would explain this step and how everyone knew she was in an awful marriage which is why she made this post public. But we never got it.", "It\u2019s not a diagnosis, it\u2019s a legal argument.", "Agree that this could be construed as parental alienation.", "I agree tacky, but tacky doesn't necessarily make you an asshole. I do think putting the caption with the picture of the kids is what brings it over the line to asshole, but other than that it's within OP's (potentially ill-advised, as you pointed out) rights to do it. Just posting it where the ex's family can't see isn't necessarily asshole-worthy, especially depending on the reason for divorce. If they personally disapprove they can cut ties with OP, they don't need to make a stink about it", "You are making your home toxic for your children by doing things like this. Celebrating a needed divorce is okay if it is quietly celebrated by a small group of confidants WITHOUT a public display. Be an adult and quietly change your relationship status and everyone will get the message. Have some dignity.", "Yeah, seems the guy managed to get away from you, props to your soon to be ex husband", "Agreed, it's literally boilerplate language in divorce decrees in my state.
