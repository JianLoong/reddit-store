Get used to the term \u201cparental alienation\u201d because you\u2019re probably going to hear it A LOT in the divorce and custody proceedings. The judge is really not going to like your little stunt.", "YTA\n\nYeah, this sounds remarkably tacky. I know divorce parties are relatively common but there's a big difference between private invitations for close friends and a big social media announcement that his family can see.", "YTA. Do what you want but leave the kids out of it, take their pic down. They don\u2019t feel the same joy you do over this no matter how much you want them to.", "YTA. \n\nHe is still the father of your children and someday the kids will know or see that mom threw a party when their family was falling apart. And yes, it is a bashfest and hopefully your children will not be in attendance. \n\nYou really aren't starting this co-parenting journey at it's best.", "Yta. You're planning a bash fest.", "YTA. Have you thought how your kids would feel watching their mom and her friends trash their dad who they still love and are hurting their family got upended? And you used a picture of them to announce and do your victory dance. You may hate your ex but they don't see him the way you do. You're stirring the pot, they're right not a classy or mature move. The kids need to see you and your ex be respectful and coparent together. Not Mom threw a Bash Dad fest. You could have had a private party without their picture associated with it on your page and hopefully them not at the party.", "YTA. I mean it's fine to have a divorce party. It's fine to bash your ex with your friends. Dragging your kids into the middle of a bash their Dad fest on social media. Thats something you should keep the kids out of.", "Whose business is it? Why would you publicly humiliate or bash the father of your kids? How would you feel if your kids saw it? Sometimes separation is good but it\u2019s no one\u2019s business unless you\u2019re looking for approval or something - yta", "YTA. Your in-laws are correct. That is the opposite of classy and bashing people in public is in quite poor taste. It is also petty.", "YTA.  Your former in-laws are right.  What a tasteless thing to do, especially when you have children.  I don't care if he is the biggest loser ever to walk the face of the earth, he is still your children's father.", "YTA you posted pictures of what I assume are children you share next to some unpleasant comments concerning their father. You may not like him but when you have kids you put their needs first. Your in-laws are right. You have no class and I feel very sorry for your children being used to score points in this way.", "YTA for including the kids.\n\nI too \u201ccelebrated\u201d my divorce but I did it with my girlfriends and definitely didn\u2019t post it on social media, private or not. There is children involved that don\u2019t need to see that level of petty.

His family is right: that is a classless move.", "Definitely YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t have enough context to be certain, but I would not be surprised if you were the antagonistic, controlling, self-centered one in the marriage.

Think of how your behavior is affecting your children and grow up, lady.", "YTA. My SIL had a divorce party, but she did not announce it online and if she had kids, she Most certainly would not have involved them. While you have primary custody, you rubbed that in his face. And doesn\u2019t he still see the kids sometimes? You just made the kid exchanges quite cringy with your actions .", "YTA.  I'm sure all your friends and family knew you were getting divorced, so let's stop pretending this wasn't just a public bashing of your ex.  Don't really care if you hate your ex. After all, he's your ex for a reason.  Having your kids in the picture as though they are celebrating as well is a classless and crappy move.\n\nAny way you cut it you aren't fooling anyone this was a giant public middle finger to your ex and you involved your children in it.  Your ex inlaws are right.", "YTA. There's no possible outcome from your actions that will leave your kids better off than they would've been if you hadn't stirred the pot.", "Why are you still friends with his family?

I let everyone know that I left my husband, had primary custody of the kids, and that I was throwing the divorce party of the century; anyone who wishes to have a positive opinion of ex\u2019s name need not attend.\n\nWhat are you celebrating? You just filed, you aren't divorced yet. You have primary custody of those kids only because he isn't in the family home ATM. If you don't have a legal reason to keep him out, that can change. \n\nCustody will be decided during the divorce. And depending on where you live, usually starts at 50/50 and then worls from there considering school/work schedules and location. \n\nYour little stunt might be used to prove attempting parental alienation *because you included your kids* \nI shudder to think what you told *them* of the situation. \n\nAnd posting it where his family can see it is just asking for them to support *him*. \n\nYou would have been much better off thinking about what you post and how your actions could impact your children and your ability co-parent. Because if you aren't divorced yet (and I know of no place that's a one day thing) *custody is not decided.* \n\nYou could have said \"made the extremely difficult decision to end my marriage and file for divorce, my kids and I appreciate all the support we can get\" \n\nThe situation would be clear, you get support, you back up your children, you look good to his family (who no matter what are the kids family) \n\nI get it, if your ex truly was toxic, it's freeing to break away. To take that first step. But you gotta be smart. Get a lawyer if you can and stay off social media.", "YTA for the way you're doing it. It's not final, he can still do some serious damage to you during the divorce proceedings. This is going to be a bashing party, you know it, and your kids know it.\n\nHere's the thing, you're probably gonna bad mouth your ex at the party and around your kids. That is a HORRIBLE thing to do.\n\nIf you want to have a divorce party, do it AFTER it's finalized. Just because you have custody now does NOT mean you'll keep it when it's over with and this action will look poorly upon you.", "YTA What a gross thing to do as a parent.  You really took the undignified approach.", "YTA and classless is exactly the right word.", "YTA, why the hell would you drag your kids into this? youre old enough to know better", "Sounds like the wrong person is throwing the party, your soon to be ex is probably better off w out you.  YTA.  \n\nAnd just because you have full custody, it doesn\u2019t necessarily make you the better parent.  IJS.", "YTA This post is perfectly fitting for the trashy sub", "As someone who grew up and witnessed my parents messy divorce, YTA. My father was and is an awful person, and I\u2019m sure my mother celebrated privately when she finally separated from him and managed to keep primary custody despite his constant threats. That being said, if my siblings or I had been involved in the planning of a party to destroy the reputation of my father it would have seriously hurt all of our perceptions of everyone involved. It\u2019s one thing to sit your kids down and discuss clear abusive behaviors if you\u2019re worried about them becoming the victims. It\u2019s another thing to parade your joy around and talk about how absolutely awful their father was, joyously reveling in the fact that they will now only see him under your new custody agreement. In fact, had I been in your kids shoes, I probably would\u2019ve actively chosen to side with my father in the hopes of regaining some stability. \n\nYou can deal with this however you want behind closed doors, but involving your kids in this way will only cause more problems down the road. \n\nI also suggest you hold back on this type of posting on your Facebook. It takes 1 second to screenshot it and send it to your ex. He can then take that screenshot into court and use it to prove that you are alienating him from his children by painting him in a bad light and therefore should not be the custodial parent. You might have primary custody now, but once you get into the nitty gritty of things you could lose out on a lot based on your public post about this ex-bashing celebration.", "I can't say who TA is without knowing why it's such a relief. I did a party too, but my ex was emotionally and physically abusive to me and my dog, a pathological liar, and cheated with anything that crossed his path. So I'm all for a divorce party, kids or not, but I can't say for sure without details. Btw I'm not asking for details, and please don't feel pressured to give them, I just honestly can't give you an answer lol", "YTA and It's such an immature and stupid thing.

Weird.", "Selfish, major asshole.\nLeave those babies out of your issues", "Without knowing more, it does sound lacking in class where your *are* bashing on him and using your (and his) children as props for your post. \n\nYes,  yta", "YTA sounds like this could be the first piece of evidence in a parental alienation case.\n\nRegardless of your feelings, that's still there dad, and you are still going to have to have some form of relationship with him until your kids are adults. This isn't a good way to start", "YTA you bashed the father of your children publicly. Unless you are intellectually stunted you know it was public. You knew is family would see it. Your own comments out you, you have members of his family on your social. You are not their friend. Friends don\u2019t publicly trash their friends families. You even went so far as to say those with a positive opinion need not attend. Definitely high school behavior. Own it. Fix it or don\u2019t. And move on.", "Let's pretend this post is written by your ex, wanting to know if he was T A for doing the exact same thing. What would your answer be?\n\nOf course YTA and so very not classy.
