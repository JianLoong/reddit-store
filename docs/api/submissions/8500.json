Alice got a job abroad so they are moving there. \n\nThey don't know what to do with the 2 dogs yet, so their current plan is to move abroad and wait a few months (up to 6) to decide if they even like it there or if they want to come back home. If they like it there, they will try to find a way to move the dogs there with them, but if it's not possible, they will rehome them in our country.\n\nI'm 21 yo, still attending University and I live with my mom. I really want to move out and live alone, but I can't afford it.\n\nAlice made me an offer. I can live in their flat for free for 6 months, no rent, no utilities, but I have to take care of their dogs. I'll have to walk them for hours every day, take them to the vet, etc. She said they will pay for anything dog related and will pay for doggy daycare for a few days during my exam periods or if I want to go on a vacation.\n\nI like her offer, her flat is much closer to my university, but taking care of 2 dogs is a lot of work. I think it's reasonable to be want to be paid for the work I do. If I didn't have to take care of the dogs, I could get a part time job, if I wanted to. So I feel like I should be reimbursed for that.\n\nAlice and our mom says that being allowed to live in her flat for free is already enough and I'm being unreasonable and money hungry.\n\nWhen they told me this, I laughed at them and told my sister she could try to find another dog sitter then and I know I'm her best option. Now they are mad at me. AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nOkay, I fucked up. I really thought Alice didn't have any other options.\n\nMy brother just told me she is now talking to our cousin, who lives 2 hours away, but wants to move to our city. They are even talking about possibly making it a long-term thing and Cousin being allowed to stay after the free 6 months is up for reduced rent, only having to pay an equal amount to their mortgage, which would normally only rent him a room...", "created_utc": 1674896865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10narg8/aita_for_asking_to_be_paid_for_6_months_of/", "score": 4644, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
