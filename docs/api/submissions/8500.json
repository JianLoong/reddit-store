I can live in their flat for free for 6 months, no rent, no utilities, but I have to take care of their dogs.

I think it's reasonable to be want to be paid for the work I do. If I didn't have to take care of the dogs, I could get a part time job, if I wanted to. So I feel like I should be reimbursed for that.\n\nAlice and our mom says that being allowed to live in her flat for free is already enough and I'm being unreasonable and money hungry.\n\nWhen they told me this, I laughed at them and told my sister she could try to find another dog sitter then and I know I'm her best option.

They\u2019re a huge time suck and take a lot of care, especially these dogs from the sound of it seem to be a large breed with a lot of exercise needs. I also wouldn\u2019t see this as a free ride and wouldn\u2019t want to be bogged down with it when I should be studying and extracurriculars and a social life.\n\nBut it also seems like you\u2019re intentionally being difficult in the effort to get paid. Getting paid is like the least of the issues here especially when you have a sibling that needs a hand for a few months.

In rent. \n\nThink about how much rent you'd pay to live in a large place in a good location by yourself. That is more than a dogsitter generally gets paid. If you got a part time job to be able to afford moving out of your mum's house, you'd work a presumably less fun job to be able to afford a most likely less good place.\n\nThis is an offer that benefits everybody very much including you and you're trying to extort your own family over an injustice that is all in your head.", "Do you think a part time job would earn you enough to rent an equivalent flat? Likely, not. YWBTA.", "YTA. It sounds like you are trying to leverage your sister to pay you for something that you are already receiving compensation in kind for. Taking advantage of her is unkind and cruel.", "NTA.  They made the offer and you countered.  I actual think this deal is better for your sister then you.  Right now you would trade free rent at home to free rent somewhere else.   You just were given added work for the free rent you already have.   Dogs take work and time.

If the dogs are well behaved, the cost to you is a little bit of freedom on the daily as you\u2019ll have to come home and you\u2019ll have to take them out.
