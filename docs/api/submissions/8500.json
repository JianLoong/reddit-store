Alice got a job abroad so they are moving there. \n\nThey don't know what to do with the 2 dogs yet, so their current plan is to move abroad and wait a few months (up to 6) to decide if they even like it there or if they want to come back home. If they like it there, they will try to find a way to move the dogs there with them, but if it's not possible, they will rehome them in our country.\n\nI'm 21 yo, still attending University and I live with my mom. I really want to move out and live alone, but I can't afford it.\n\nAlice made me an offer. I can live in their flat for free for 6 months, no rent, no utilities, but I have to take care of their dogs. I'll have to walk them for hours every day, take them to the vet, etc. She said they will pay for anything dog related and will pay for doggy daycare for a few days during my exam periods or if I want to go on a vacation.\n\nI like her offer, her flat is much closer to my university, but taking care of 2 dogs is a lot of work. I think it's reasonable to be want to be paid for the work I do. If I didn't have to take care of the dogs, I could get a part time job, if I wanted to. So I feel like I should be reimbursed for that.\n\nAlice and our mom says that being allowed to live in her flat for free is already enough and I'm being unreasonable and money hungry.\n\nWhen they told me this, I laughed at them and told my sister she could try to find another dog sitter then and I know I'm her best option. Now they are mad at me.

Well unfortunately now you are not getting that option, because she *is* going to get another sitter now that you have shown yourself off to be ungrateful of an offer most wouldn't give, and kind of an idiot for burning such a good offer. Plenty of people would kill for 6 months of free living with the only cost of time spent taking care of dogs, you are very much replaceable there.\n\nYTA", "YTA\n\n>I think it's reasonable to be want to be paid for the work I do.\n\nThey are paying you - with free room & board, as well as utilities (I don't know how one covers the cost of gas, water, electric, etc. in countries outside of the US)", "I'd maybe look at how much renting their home would be, and compare that to how much you'd be paid to dog sit. Pretty sure YTA here, and kind of a dumbass as well", "YTA for expecting to be paid monetarily when you\u2019re being paid well beyond that in apartment and utilities. the amount of money you\u2019d be saving by not paying for rent and utilities is well, well beyond what your labor is worth for taking care of the dogs. alice could easily sublet her apartment and put her dogs into daycare and get good money for those months, but she\u2019s offering you an amazing deal for you instead and you\u2019re being very greedy to ask for both the apartment and utilities that *she\u2019s paying for* and money for your time. your family is correct, you\u2019re acting incredibly spoiled and money hungry.", "Op is reeking \"I have never worked a job in my life\" vibes. YTA..", "YTA. \nmaybe a compromise maybe they charge you rent and then pay you to dog sit and you may realise how unreasonable you are being", "YTA. Rent and utilities for free is already overpayment for caring for dogs", "YTA, you will live rent free and utilities free, alone in a flat closer to your uni. Try googling how much you'd have to cough up in cash to do the same and BAM that's how much you are payed for dogsitting. With current economy situation I imagine the some won't come up low", "YTA. Do you really think that you could pay for a house and utilities just by dog sitting 2 dogs? This is a sweet deal. You should apologize and snatch this deal up before someone else does.", "YTA. Lolz", "YTA. If you wanted to get a job and move out you would have already done this. I think she should reconsider her offer to you and find someone else. I don\u2019t think it would be too difficult to find someone that wants free accomodation plus utilities for the price of looking after 2 dogs. You seem to know best so go get that job\u2026.", "YTA  \nThey are giving you a great deal. Why don't you have them charge you full rent and take out the amount they owe you for taking care of the dogs, if you feel like you're being cheated so badly?", "YTA\nLiving rentfree closer to uni and everything dogrelated will be paid by your sister? I think that's a pretty good deal. If my sister asked me this, I wouldn't doubt!\n\n\n>If I didn't have to take care of the dogs, I could get a part time job, if I wanted to.\n\nYou said it yourself. If you wanted to. It seems that when you say no to your sister, that you still won't get a part time job. So what do you have to lose?", "YTA. Not only was she offering to pay you in kind, i.e. not with money but with free lodging, but you laughed in her face rather than politely turning her down if it didn't suit you. There's any number of reasons it might not work - it's just six months, for example, and you might not be sure what happens after, or you might not want to do an extended house and petsit - but there's no reason not to just say no but thank her for the offer.\n\nYou would not get a flat with the wages from a part time job, and asking her to pay you essentially twice - once with free lodging and once with a wage - is an AH move.\n\nShe could just make a short let for slightly more hassle, earn money from whoever rents and use it to pay for dog boarding.", "YTA - you could get a part time job with two dogs. They\u2019re not babies AND they\u2019ll be in doggy daycare potentially. I would take the deal", "Wow.. I mean definitely YTA\n\nYou laughed in their faces for stating the obvious?\nYou are getting a free apartment for 6 months that would make your life easier. If they were to pay you for doggy sitting it would still end up much lower than the rent.\n\nYou are being absolutely greedy and a bad sister.\nFamily helps each other and they don't expect to be paid. You are being paid for it (by having no rent) and you still want more?\nJust greedy.\n\nYou need to apologise", "You are the arsehole, you are also entitled and deeply out of touch. Walking the dogs (where I live) will make you about $22 an hour, before tax, average rent will cost you about $530 a week- that\u2019s average across a very large area, a desirable suburb will be a lot more! So how about you get paid for looking after the dogs and in exchange your sister charges you market rate rent?", "YTA, probably wouldn't be able to afford the apartment on the part time job's wage and you'd probably spend more time on that anyway.", "YTA. This is an offer you either accept or politely decline. There is not an appropriate way to negotiate compensation.", "YTA and maybe shouldn't move out of your mom's house yet as you sound kinda na\u00efve. If you don't want the offer, I'm interested!", "YTA. Just politely decline her offer and go see what a terrible financial decision you made when you try and rent your own place.", "YTA\n\nAs I am reading it, your sister owns the flat so rent technically isn't a thing.\nBUT\nYou have a nice chance of risk free living on your own for 6 months without paying a cent to have a roof over your head. You only have to walk 2 dogs for like 2hours a day. And you even get days off!\n\nYou could not ask for a better preparation for life than that", "YTA. Rent and utilities is expensive. Not having to pay that is a blessing. It\u2019s quite rude of you expect your sister to pay you for dog sitting, when you\u2019re gonna live in her flat with no bills to pay. Rent and utilities adds up to a lot more than the wage for dog sitting.", "Info\n\nAre you currently working? If not and if you didn\u2019t dog sit, would you definitely get a job?", "May not be very popular, but YTA\n\n>no rent, no utilities\n\nHow much for rent in an apartment similar + how much for utilities = dog sitter pay\n\nYou'll just have to pay for groceries and your phone (if not in a family plan). \n\n>I really want to move out and live alone, but I can't afford it.\nI can see that... the most expensive part is been taken care of, and you want more money. Tell the truth, you want to stay at your sister's place without having to pay or take care of dogs. \n\nWell, get your own place then, oh yes, you can't afford it...", "YTA. They are giving you hundreds of whatever you currency in services to do this and taking care of dogs isn't that hard", "YTA you seem a bit out of touch", "YTA. Even high maintenance dogs don\u2019t need more than 4 hours of your time each day. So let\u2019s be generous and say you get $20 USD/hour, x30 days/month, = $2400. A nice apartment where I live (which is pretty low in terms of housing, compared to most other areas in developed countries) would be between $2000 and $2500/month. Add utilities, and you\u2019re already either breaking even or in the red, not counting any other living expenses. \n\nMost likely, their monthly cost is more than that. So take the win, and don\u2019t exploit your sister, just because you can.", "YTA\n\nThey are letting you live completely for free for 6 months in a location that is much more convenient for you, and in return you have look after 2 dogs. You don\u2019t even have to pay for the dog\u2019s expenses and they are giving you vacation days, take the offer and don\u2019t push your luck", "YTA. You already know how expensive living on your own is because you haven't been able to do so yet. You're lucky you can find a place for less than $1,000 a month. Utilities can easily be $100-$400, which can be internet, electric, water, garbage pickup, etc. \n\nIt sounds to me like you could've gotten a part time job already but haven't done so and you're using that as an excuse. You know very well that if you truly wanted a job you would have one already.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What happens if you have a full day of classes? Who is going to let the dogs out for some relief? How much walking time do they need each day? Would you be able to spare that time every day considering you won't be able to do anything else at the same time? How much will it eat into your study time when you have exams? Will you have anyone else to help look after them if you can't for some reason?", "YTA. First of all to yourself if you don\u2019t take this offer but I believe since you think she\u2019ll agree at some point because she trusts you in dog sitting, you\u2019re making her pay you more.", "YTA.  6 months of free rent in utilities is worth literal THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS.  They are forking over a shit ton of money for an apartment they don't even live in just so you and the dogs can have a home.\n\nAlso, there is absolutely no reason why you can't balance caring for dogs and a part time job.  No dog requires that much time and attention that you can't squeeze and 8 or 6 hour shift into the day.  You might have a day where you basically get no free time, but welcome to freaking adulthood.  Also getting literally THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS in compensation for it, so why complain?\n\nOf course, you are still free to say no if you don't think this living situation is viable, but I think you are wrong to try to haggle for more money.", "YTA. They could just go to trustedhousesitters.com and offer a stranger the same arrangement.", "Yta. Apparently you have no idea how much rent and Associated expenses cost. Taking care of a couple of dogs is not that much work in consideration for free rent. Most people are able to have dogs and still have a full-time job.

A part time job wouldn't be able to afford a place to yourself like your sister is offering, but if your sister had to hire someone to take care of the animals it would be at a minimum $70 a day. Maybe you can find a mid ground like the give a little extra to cover food expenses for you and maybe you get a part time job walking other peoples dogs and make a business out of it. You do come off as a brat with how you wrote this as if you were entitled to compensation equal to a full time job, and dogs are not that much of an effort though they do take time, but dialing it back and making it seem like you need money to pay for food while you are there on your own may work in your favor.", "YTA- she is offering to pay rent and utilities, which is more than fair compensation for the work of looking after two dogs. Most people have to work a full time job all month to afford those things. \n\nYour entitlement is unbelievable. 2 dogs will not impinge your ability to have a part time job, you want extra money, go and work for it.", "Info: who's paying for food? \nHow long is walking them 'for hours every day?' \n\nPretty sure yta, but if you can't afford food I can imagine the situation 's not doable for you...
