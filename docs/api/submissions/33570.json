Kylie was 10 when I moved in. She lost her mom when she was 5 or 6 and my aunt had been married to my uncle for a little over a year. So it was a really difficult time for her. But I remember thinking Kylie might get what it was like a little. But she was very clear from day one we were not family.\n\nOne thing that always stuck out to me was how Kylie really resented/hated my aunt. My aunt couldn't ask Kylie to do anything without being yelled at. She couldn't do anything nice for her without getting glared at. She'd accuse her of disrespecting her mom by \"trying to play mom\", she'd accuse her of doing stuff that she had no right to do, she'd tell my aunt to know her place.\n\nMy aunt always understood Kylie was grieving and she pushed my uncle to make sure Kylie got enough time with him but was also able to talk to him. They had her in therapy as well. My aunt told me once when I got upset on her behalf that some people, kids or adults, can find it hard to see their living parent move on and have a new relationship after they lose the other parent and Kylie was struggling.\n\nA few months ago I saw Kylie for the first time in 12 years and she could not hide her still existing hatred for my aunt. The way she looked at her. I even heard her tell my uncle that my aunt was nothing to her and all she did was attempt to steal a dead woman's entire family. It made me realize just how strong that resentment can be. I also know from my uncle's sister, that Kylie is still furious my aunt ever tried to ask her to do anything or issued any kind of consequence for her behavior when she was a kid.\n\nThe experience of living with them always made me say I didn't see myself ever wanting to date and marry someone with kids but having seen her hatred for my aunt at 30, knowing she still resents my aunt for even daring to ask her to do something in the home, it made me realize that while it can work and some people have amazing blended families, it's not for me.\n\nA few days ago I came back home for Christmas (staying until the 28th). My uncle was talking about my boyfriend and then he asked me about this guy at work who asked me out a couple of times and why I never gave him a chance since I thought he was cute, etc. I told him it just wouldn't work but he kept pushing and I told him it was because he had kids. He told me that was a strange reason when I want kids and I said yeah, but after seeing how Kylie treated my aunt I have decided I would never be a stepmom.\n\nMy uncle was pissy about it and told me I can't swear off men with kids for that reason and he said divorced and widow(er)ed parents deserve to find happiness again. I said they do and I would never say they shouldn't have that. But I do not want to be that for them. He said it was rude for me to blame Kylie.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703269329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18olefi/aita_for_telling_my_uncle_that_i_would_never_be_a/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why this might make me an AH is it is appointing a lot of blame and maybe being harsh to not just Kylie but to my uncle as well.

You're uncle's a bit of a... not sure what the word is (narcissist, sociopath, misogynist) but it's concerning that he feels that he (and people like him) are entitled to be happy, and if that makes the other people in his life miserable, too bad, they should just take the hit because they aren't entitled to their own happiness - just him.", "NTA. You were just being honest about your experience growing up. Marrying a widow/widower with kids can be a challenge, and it\u2019s absolutely okay to admit you aren\u2019t equipped for that challenge. \n\nThat said, absolutely normal for anyone to be hurt when they hear you don\u2019t want to follow in their footsteps because you don\u2019t like where they lead.\n\nIf you did want to smooth things over, you may want to talk to him again and reword how you initially phrased it, something like, \u201cSorry it came across like I was blaming Kylie, I just meant that I saw that it was challenging for [Aunt].

He's right, widow(er)s do deserve happiness and to find someone if they choose. However, it is your life. I would't want to date anyone with kids either. Now, that might change when I'm older, I'm only 24 now. Your opinion is valid regardless of your experience. Having kids and dating is hard- babysitters, school, parenting, etc.- there are a lot more variables that are now introduces and it is complicated. Also, if I was in that position, I wound't want to start seriously seeing someone unless my kid liked them- how the hell do you navigate that? You don't what to introduce them too early and have one party get attached and it does't work out. You don't to introduce them too late and make your kid or partner feel like you are hiding them. And what happens if they don't get along? Stay in the relationship and risk your kid feel like your aren't on their team or have to start the process all over again? And that is just the perspective of the person with the kid. Getting into a relationship with someone with a kid you don't what to feel like you are replacing their parent, but you want to form a bond. They are likely to feel resentful, and what are you supposed to do? Tiptoe around them your whole life? \n\nHe took what you said personally when in actuality it has nothing to do with him.", "Nta your aunt is a better woman than I. I can\u2019t blame kids for having those feelings but I can dip the fuck out. I\u2019m not going to be a punching bad for a grieving kid. Me being miserable isn\u2019t going to help the kids. The dad needs to realize the sacrifices his wife made. You should have went in on him. He doesn\u2019t have to punish his kid for it but he better appreciate his wife and what she went through and is still going through. I hope he put down boundaries now that his kid is older but it sounds like he went with the ignorance is bliss.", "NTA -he probably knew the answer and shouldn\u2019t have asked if he wasn\u2019t prepared to hear the truth.

In all honesty I agree with your stance too, becoming a potential stepparent seems genuinely difficult to navigate properly, especially when it\u2019s with a widow.\n\nIf I had to bet I think your uncle is trying to project his guilt that he didn\u2019t stop Kylie from mistreating your aunt for all these years. It\u2019s probably not pleasant for him to have confirmation that he\u2019s partly responsible for your  stance on this matter.
