Having kids and dating is hard- babysitters, school, parenting, etc.- there are a lot more variables that are now introduces and it is complicated. Also, if I was in that position, I wound't want to start seriously seeing someone unless my kid liked them- how the hell do you navigate that? You don't what to introduce them too early and have one party get attached and it does't work out. You don't to introduce them too late and make your kid or partner feel like you are hiding them.

In all honesty I agree with your stance too, becoming a potential stepparent seems genuinely difficult to navigate properly, especially when it\u2019s with a widow.\n\nIf I had to bet I think your uncle is trying to project his guilt that he didn\u2019t stop Kylie from mistreating your aunt for all these years. It\u2019s probably not pleasant for him to have confirmation that he\u2019s partly responsible for your  stance on this matter.

This is absolutely a boundary you\u2019re allowed to have for yourself. And while I see your uncle\u2019s point, he shouldn\u2019t get pissy with you because you feel differently than he does. You\u2019ve seen first hand how this situation and you\u2019re allowed to make the decision that\u2019s best for you.", "NTA, he demanded the truth and then got butt hurt because he didn't like the truth.

She deserves better than to have to walk on eggshells for having committed the egregious crime of\u2026.marrying a guy with a kid.", "NTA dating someone with kids isn\u2019t for everyone. You seen first hand how bad it can be and have chosen to not but yourself in that situation thanks to his daughter.", "Your uncle is a dick", "NTA. If that's the only example you have been around, it is understandable for you to feel the way you do. If anyone has a problem they can f*** themselves.", "NTA. I\u2019m not saying it can\u2019t work at all, but blending a family can be challenging, even in the best of circumstances, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with deciding it\u2019s a challenge you\u2019d rather not face. Kind of like there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying you wouldn\u2019t want to marry somebody in the military, even though that can work, too.\n\nThe fact that your uncle got pissy about it instead of being acknowledging this indicates to me that there\u2019s some defensiveness on his part and maybe some buried guilt that he didn\u2019t handle it as well as he could have/should have, and both Kylie and your aunt suffered as a result.", "Tell him if he had raised his daughter right, you might have a more positive outlook on it.", "NTA. \n\nI grew up as a step kid, but my situation and dumb luck is EXTREMELY rare.

He failed both his daughter and wife.", "Your uncle was part of the problem, so he doesn\u2019t like being called out. Tough. NTA. My heart hurts for step-parents that so often go through something like this. A kid having difficulty with the transition is one thing. A kid being rude and hateful to a step-parent should never be tolerated, but it often is under the excuse that they\u2019re having a difficult time. Great, but so is the step-parent, and if the bio-parent never addresses it, they are also the asshole.", "Nta you can swear off any person for any reason you want.", "NTA\n\nYour uncle never bothered to help your aunt manage Kylie around and turned a blind eye to the abuse she put your aunt through. And he's mad you don't want to date a man with kids? It's your choice. You don't want to be a figure of abuse to someone who lost their mother and views you as a replacement. Yes, experiences play a role in shaping your preferences. Your uncle can't berate you for that. I only wish you said this in front of Kylie.", "NTA same here! I saw how my mom was treated and I never want to take the chance of being a step parent.

From your viewpoint what you've said is totally true", "NTA\n\nBeing realistic about a potential future is a good thing. I would never date a person with kids because I don't like kids. Not wanting to be a step parent is also an excellent reason to remove them from the dating pool. \n\nWhen a person has a baby, they exclude themselves from a large chunk of the dating pool. This is reality. Most people don't want to take care of other peoples kids or willingly sign up for baby mama/daddy drama.", "NTA\n\nWhat you said had nothing to do with divorcees, widowers, Kylie, or children of divorcees/widowers. It only had to do with your experiences and how it affected you. You witnessed your aunt being mistreated, you witnessed her struggle in her own home, you witnessed her life partner do very little to address the situation, and you witnessed a lack of respect in your home. As a result, you\u2019d rather not risk having those experiences. You didn\u2019t blame anyone for what happened and set a standard for yourself. Also, he asked you about your life and happiness. All the other people he thinks deserves happiness is irrelevant to the conversation. You not marrying someone with children is not keeping anyone that fits that description  from being happy. He\u2019s being very one sided, selfish, and inconsiderate of the people who have to blend into a family and the potential struggles and sacrifices they have to go through if their stepchildren decide they don\u2019t like them, and it\u2019s very apparent he doesn\u2019t care given the struggles your aunt went through and how far in the background he was. \n\nHe\u2019s projecting. He\u2019s thinking of what his life would be like if your aunt or other women made that decision. He\u2019s thinking of the horribleness his daughter put your aunt through. He should\u2019ve been a better example if he wanted you to consider marrying someone who may be in his situation.", "NTA. I would tell him if he was a better husband to his wife, you wouldn\u2019t feel this way\nSince by the way your post reads\nYour awful uncle allowed his terrible daughter to mistreat your aunt her whole fucking life\nWhen she did nothing wrong\n\nIf he ever pushes again \nMake sure to tell him that you saw how terrible of a husband he was to your aunt and how he let his daughter abuse and mistreat his wife. \n\nI hope your uncle and cousin live the lives they deserve. \n\nAnd ideally your aunt is happy.", "NTA. Step-parenting is a thankless task. Yes, widowed and divorced parents deserve to find happiness again but blending families hardly ever goes smoothly. Why people rush to move in and get married when their kids are against it is beyond me.", "NTA. I had a terrible stepdad but my husband has an awesome stepmom. That woman has adopted me as her own and spoils me. Hearing stories there were issues when she first came into their lives (on both sides) but they get along great now. \n\nBeing a step-parent is hard. Very hard.

You want your own story and life to build with someone", "NTA -- You stated the truth, your Uncle is an AH for not doing more to intervene on your Aunt's behalf and let Kylie keep being abusive like that.

Also, you\u2019re not wasting anyone\u2019s time.\n\nUncle is just appalled that what he/aunt normalized by accepting is actually so off putting that it resulted in you making that decision in the first place.

Your uncle is as entitled as fk.", "NTA. Step parenting is probably the most unappreciated family role. I have seen good angelic women and men take on that full role with all their heart and bank accts and wow... it turned into such a shitshow because the kids and bio parents didnt see them as adults to be respected. Just an extra set of hands and ATM\nI would highly advice against. I await my down votes lol but at least I don't have to deal with any of this shit", "NTA and I don\u2019t know that I see it as blaming Kylie as much as using it as research. Some people see their parents get divorced and never want to get married. Some see their cousins spoiled and never want to have kids. She has done that for you. \n\nI\u2019m thinking your uncle is embarrassed that you are using his life as your example. Doesn\u2019t sound like he found a good therapist for your cousin.", "No judgement, but I hope you realise that Kylie was severely traumatised by her mom\u2019s death and adoption, and seemingly this trauma was never correctly addressed professionally, instead it was catered for by your aunt and uncle, perhaps out of misguided compassion, perhaps because it was more convenient, which led to Kylie continuing living life with that.\n\nI hope you also realise that you were also traumatised by observing these events which created a certain stereotype of adoption and step-families for you, an unrealistic stereotype, as same as other things, all adoptions and adopted families are different - some are great, and some are shit.\n\n\nDate who you want, it's really up to you, but do consider discussing your views with psychologist, perhaps. They are a bit extreme.", "Here\u2019s the thing, your both right. \n\nI\u2019m a stepdad myself and my kid and I have a great relationship. It all depends on the situation. Could you have a similar situation if you dated the other guy? Yea. I\u2019m not going to lie. It\u2019s also equally possible it would be like mine, but that\u2019s irrelevant. You have a boyfriend now. \n\nWhat makes HIM TA is that he allowed his daughter to treat your Aunt horribly. And then to try to push that on you until you popped just\u2026. he\u2019s not a good man. So no NTA and this internet stranger is proud you told him what\u2019s up!", "NTA.\n\n> He said it was rude for me to blame Kylie.\n\nIt would be unfair to blame 10 year old Kylie for having complicated feelings about her stepmother. Kylie is fucking 30 now, it\u2019s well past time for her to have grown up. If her father STILL won\u2019t hold her accountable for her behavior then no wonder she never outgrew it.", "NTA\n\n Your aunt is a much better person than i'm. Kylie would've found herself sent to the first boarding school available like really fast. No way i would've put up with a spoiled awful brat in my house, let alone care for her", "NTA. And you shouldn\u2019t blame Kylie. The blame is all Uncle\u2019s. He married an unsuspecting woman and dropped her in it.", "NTA. Sorry to single parents, but becoming a stepparent is usually horrible. I\u2019ve heard of the occasional story where it works out, but it\u2019s a crapshoot at best. It\u2019s an emotionally draining role with very little joy. You\u2019re expected to do things constantly for the kid(s) and love them like your own but with no ability to actually parent them. It\u2019s a great time if you\u2019re open to being emotionally abused and later told that your mere existence ruined someone else\u2019s life (a life you helped pay for). \n\nYour uncle didn\u2019t make sure his daughter was ready for a new adult in her life. And if he had done his due diligence he would have realized that his kid couldn\u2019t take anyone new. He should have never gotten married to your aunt. He\u2019s likely pissed off because your response made him reckon with reality. \n\nMany parents should not remarry until their kid is either ready for it or they\u2019re out of the house. And if your kid is ready for it, make boundaries, roles, and acceptable behavior very clear.", "> He said it was rude for me to blame Kylie.\n\nHe\u2019s right that Kylie isn\u2019t at fault. He should not have married your aunt while Kylie was still working through this complex feelings as a child.  He put himself before the well-being of his child, and Kylie is still not secure enough in her attachment to him to realize that it\u2019s his fault and not your aunt\u2019s. \n\nIn some people, the trauma from parents dying looks a lot like abandonment trauma, and while I don\u2019t know Kylie, that may be a part of what\u2019s happening here.\n\nNTA.", "As someone who also wouldn't choose to be with someone who is already a parent, I cannot help but internally roll my eyes at a \"I am basing a life decision on this one example\" story. Most likely, you aren't up for being a stepparent, and are using your aunt's family as a convenient excuse. Not wanting to be a stepmother is a completely valid choice, it doesn't  make you a bad person, and you don't need to evoke the spectre of this disastrous blended family to justify it.\n\n  \nNTA for telling your uncle this, since I am sure you believe it, and he was pressuring you; though you could just as easily say you weren't attracted to the guy, so I kind-of think you used the opportunity to tell him. He is definitely the asshole for marrying someone over his underage child's being so against it; sure, single parents deserve to find love, but if it is coming at the cost of making their children unhappy, they need to make the sacrifice of waiting till the child has moved out and isn't forced to live in this situation. Also, sorry, but your sainted aunt bears some blame for this also; she could have avoided creating this dysfunction.", "NTA but I don\u2019t blame your cousin at all. Mom had been dead what, a couple years and he was already remarried? He didn\u2019t waste time.", "Parents should prioritise their children and adults shouldn't get involved with parents who don't. She never consented to having this woman in her life, neither her father nor his wife cared about the distress it caused her. It's easier for her to hate your aunt because they're not related. She's an interloper so she's getting all the blame.", "NTA but be advised, the older you get while still single and looking for love, the lower your chances of finding someone who doesn't have kids already. As a single woman in her 40s, I know very few single guys, and have met very few single guys, who don't already have kids. And given how many people are having kids later in life, those kids can vary in age from toddlers to teens to young adults.\n\nI do think it's a bit unfair that you're judging all kids by Kylie. If you found someone who'd been divorced for several years, rather than someone who was a widower, you could still have a perfectly fine relationship with those kids. But it's your life. I'm just trying to share some words of experience.", "Just because Kylie sucks, doesn't mean you can't ever be a step parent, or to be involved with someone who already has kids. Your uncle is entirely right about that portion.  \n\n\nThat said, it isn't rude for you to blame Kylie. She is a problem. it really doesn't sound like the resentment she's harboring for your uncle's wife is completely unfair.", "Does Kylie resent your aunt because her dad had affair with her?", "NTA.\n\nBeing a step-parent is hard. I\u2019m a brand new step-parent. I\u2019m struggling and I\u2019m lucky enough that my step-kids adore me. It is tough and it\u2019s not for everyone.", "NTA, and especially,  N T A because if you aren't cut out to love your stepkids, you should not be the one marrying the guy who has them.   That said,  though,  you have, from what I can tell,  one data point.  I have several more I could offer.  Suffice to say that,  like any other human relationship,  stepparenting can go great, terrible,  or in between.  My siblings and I all adore our first stepmom, and to this day,  we are her children, almost as much as we are our mothers.   We watch out for her, will care for her in her old age.   The second, we couldn't care for because she didn't care for us and did all she could to keep our dad out of our lives.  She and dad are both gone now.  My daughter loves both of her stepparents very much,  and I'm happy to see it.  My husband said he did not want kids when we met,  but he liked me well enough to give it a shot,  fell for my kid, too, and ultimately adopted her.\n\nI would not rule out the role entirely on the basis that you might have a bad relationship with the child,  any more than I'd rule out working because you might not like your colleagues.  If you ever do find a fabulous,  lovable guy with a kid or two,  AND you're otherwise not opposed to children,  maybe get to know the kids and decide if you get along with them.

And yes, I am talking about her behaviour, not about the trauma she still has (and will have for the rest of her life).

A grown adult gets put at the mercy of the emotional state of a child but still has to be the adult in the relationship all while being abused, neglected, insulted, and there is never a right answer.  And the bio parent can't or won't act because it could be seen as forcing a relationship.  I wouldn't touch that mess with a 50ft pole.  \n\n\nIt's perfectly acceptable that having kids already is a dealbreaker for a new relationship.  Not everyone wants to be a step parent. And that's okay.", "Well really, you're blaming him, as he just allowed this crappy behavior to continue their whole lives without addressing it with, OPE, therapy or something.   \n\n\nNTA.

He doesn\u2019t get to dictate who you date and it\u2019s wild he thinks he does.", "NTA. \n\nYour uncle kept pressing the subject. He wanted an answer. After not leaving you alone, he got what he wanted. It just wasn\u2019t what he expected.", "NTA, you get to make whatever choice works best for you. But he's right that you shouldn't blame Kylie, you should blame him. Your aunt sounds like she went out of her way to be super understanding, but you didn't mention how your uncle behaved. And from the little I've just heard, I think he's the failure here. \n\nI was a single mom for 12 years, my son's bio dad isn't dead, but he might as well have been because he disappeared after my son was born and I have no idea where he is. (This was after a 3 year on and off again relationship but we were engaged when I got pregnant.) I met my now husband when my son was 12 and there were growing pains bringing us together as a family when my son wasn't used to sharing me with anyone. But my son was raised to be respectful to any adult who was put in charge of him by me, and that if he was misbehaving in front of another adult and they called him out on it, that he needed to take the reprimand and change his behavior. And that as an adult in our household that my husband was well within his rights to ask my son to clean up after himself and help with reasonable requests around the house. \n\nThere is no way I would have stood around and watched my son do the things your Uncle watched his daughter do. I would have sat her down and told her that she doesn't have to call Aunt Mom, and she doesn't even have to like her if their personalities don't mesh well, but she d@mn well needs to show her respect and appreciate that Aunt is a member of the household and does a lot of things to help this household run and you need to treat her kindly, because every person deserves to be treated kindly. Yes, your mother isn't here anymore and that is a huge loss and I understand that it hurts, but it is not okay to take out your hurt on Aunt or anyone else for that matter. We're going to need to work with your therapist to find some other outlet for the anger and hurt you are feeling about the loss of your mother and the anger you are feeling towards me for getting remarried. Aunt isn't a replacement for your mother, nobody could ever replace your mother, but unfortunately she is gone and we're still here and we have to keep living and part of living is making new relationships. And you might not understand it now, but it can be very difficult for adults to be alone especially when raising children and as much as I loved your mother, and I always will love her, I couldn't be alone in this anymore. So it's okay if you are mad at your mom for leaving, and it's okay if you are mad at me for not being strong enough to raise you on my own, but don't be angry at Aunt, because none of this is her fault and she's a really wonderful person who just wants to love us. And we can accept that love and give her love without diminishing the love we also have for your mom. \n\nOr something like that I guess. Anyway, your Uncle sucks and his daughter is like this because of him. I feel so bad for your Aunt who apparently is a saint or a masochist for staying in that situation.", "First, NTA\n\nSecond, I felt terrified reading about this. Scary about being a stepmom. I guess I thought such things happens more in movies or TV dramas and less in real life. I recently fell in love with a guy who has 2 kids under age 10 and when I thought about a possible future with him, I never really thought of the possible bad side.", "NTA, although personally I would treat it on a case by case basis if I were someone considering being a stepdad (extremely unlikely unless the mother was exceptional and dad was gone).  Kids vary, and OP seems like a good example of someone with gratitude.  However, if you see the anger/resentment in the kid at the start; run the other direction and don't look back.\n\nBeing a stepparent is a hard and thankless job when you don't have kids.

Maybe he could make the case of it being fair or not, (it is) but Kylie is an adult.

I wouldn\u2019t ever marry a man with young children, because honestly almost every divorced or widowed father I\u2019ve met let their kids walk all over them and have zero boundaries. Those kids are nightmares- not because they are bad, but because they think their behavior is okay because they haven\u2019t been parented.

From my experience it's not worth it unless you are already divorced/widowed with kids and meet a person who you are willing to do this for.

I feel very bad for your aunt, especially given what patience and love she displayed. \n\nAs for you, I get your stance and why you have it and you are free to date or not date anyone for any reason, no one can stop you. But it might be unfair and limit you, especially since you aren't childfree. Most people your age have kids, and since you want kids it will be harder to find someone in that age bracket without them that wants them. \n\nAgain, it is fine to have that stance. But most blended families aren't like this. Many people love their step parents and build a great relationship with them. My kids get along better with my husband then their own father, and the only thing we needed were clear boundaries about what was expected from him going in, and them with their treatment of him. \n\nFor example, my husband is free to ask them to do something and they are expected to do what he asks. But I don't allow him to discipline them, as I feel that is my role. Instead, on the rare occasions there have been problems, he has let me know and I have dealt with it. This has worked for seven years and matches our dynamic, especially as my kids were not that little when we got together and are teenagers now.\n\n But what makes that work is that I actually listen and step in, I don't ignore or make excuses for the behavior. It is also helpful because he never had kids and didn't always understand or have a fair perspective on why there was an issue. So if I felt he was angrier than the issue warranted, or there was a misunderstanding, or if a talk rather than punishment was better, it gave me the chance to sit down with him first. That doesn't always happen and strict rules or punishments, especially from someone not used to kids, can cause irreparable damage. \n\nThankfully, my kids have never had too many issues or instances where punishment is needed in the first place. Most problems if they do arise are worked out with a talk and an apology, then changed behavior. It shows that a power struggle and resentment doesn't have to come from blended families when the parents communicate and work together. If you can't do that with your partner you have a deeper issue that is about the kids or who is biologically related to them, such as in the case of your aunt and uncle. \n\nI would encourage you to consider your perspective on this issue before you rule out being a step parent altogether.
