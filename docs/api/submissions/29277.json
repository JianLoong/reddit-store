She is not a bad person. \n\nYou on the other had want to force people to see the world as you do, and name call and are horrible to people who don't conform that way... what does that make you?", "Yeah I suppose I can see that, however I still feel nine is a little young. Thanks for being rational!", "Okay please show me a citation with your definitions of these words instead of calling me racist", ">Well thats just racist to assume everything means the same everywhere.  \n>  \n>Terms are fluid. For example - \"gay\" here is quite an offensive term\n\nAre you sure you aren't the 9 year old here? Because you seem to have trouble understanding some very basic concepts...", "Gay is not an offensive term in Ireland you absolute loon", "The mom here is objectively a dumb bigot", "She got mad at her son for being open about his relationship lol. Thats pretty blatantly bigoted.", "And parents who decide that way are horrible bigots who are assholes. They do as much damage as teaching their kids the earth is flat or whites are superior", "She is indoctrinating a poor child into being a homophobe, she is going out of her way. Oh no how dare I not be tolerant of pure intolerance.", "You are a bad person.", "NTA your mother is clearly homophobic even if she is \u201ctrying\u201d to be accepting of your relationship. what are you explained to your brother is just as inappropriate as explaining a heterosexual couple, a married couple, or anyone you could be dating for that matter, how is that inappropriate?", "Meh, it seems your mom doesn't approve of that, if she isn't okay with it, you shouldn't speak of it to your 9 year old brother, if your mom was cool with it sure, but it's not your kid, it seems like you telling your bro is validation for you, soft asshole, you should think about it, you know your mom, you knew she wouldn't like it, but did it anyway for validation from a 9 year old, bro got me fucked up", "Yes, stop forcing sexuality on kids", "NTA your mom is setting your brother up for a confusing life, sounds like their probably gonna be overtly sheltered", "Nta", "NTA. I'll never understand why some people think that telling children that gay people exist must also require an explanation on dick-in-a-butt sex", "I\u2019m gay guy much older than you. All my brother\u2019s and sisters\u2019s children were told I was gay from an early age because they all agreed it would save them getting confused. None of the kids cared, uncle Russ has boyfriends not girlfriend\u2019s that\u2019s all they knew and it was normal for them. All those kids are adults now and have good relationship with me. I grew up in the UK in very non religious family. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Your brother not stupid if your mum not going to tell him, someone at school will and their view might be very negative. Also your mum might think he has no access to internet but other kids at school will, he probably knows more than she realises.", "NTA your mom is homophobic and theres nothing inappropriate about a kid learning what gay is. gay kids exist", "NTA \n\nLots of people for whatever reason still think its a choice or that you can be influenced or \u201cgroomed\u201d into being gay even though every gay person I have met and also myself included is adamant they didn\u2019t have a choice of what they were attracted to it just happened to be the same gender when they hit puberty. Doesn\u2019t matter how many times you tell them they don\u2019t believe you or don\u2019t care because of hate. \n\nTelling him gay people exist is not inappropriate its a fact of life and always will be. Unfortunetely for the forseeable centuries (if humanity even lasts that long) i dont think that thought process will go away. Him knowing about it is not going to change his future or confuse him.\n\nEdit: Since covid most of the world has actually gone backwords and lgbtq people have been dragged through the mud, not only concerning overall rights but with the public too. Politicians, media, and twitter have made a culture war when more important things like actual war, housing costs, grocery costs are left ignored but our politicians are spending time and energy into making anti-gay bills. Like let us live our lives in these \u201cfree\u201d countries please I am minding my own business. Sorry turned into a bit of a rant but its true. Priorities are out of whack with people right now. More concerned about the gays than if your kid will be able to afford a house with a \u201cgood job\u201d in the future", "NTA. I don\u2019t see how informing your little brother about sexual preferences is bad, unless your trying to influence him to change his.", "NTA LGTBQ+ subjects are not inappropriate for a child. Your mom is homophobic.", "Nta", "obviously NTA you just explained the literal definition, nothing sexual or inappropriate, shes just homophobic", "NTA.  Your explanation was simple and age-appropriate.  Your mom is clearly not accepting of you if she doesn't want your little brother to understand the basics of your existence!", "NTA your mom is homophobic", "Of course you\u2019re NTA.

I hope you're saving to move out as soon as you're old enough.", "My mother in the late 1960\u2019s explained my cousin\u2019s relationship as \u201csome boys date girls and some boys date boys, some girls date girls and some girls date boys.\u201d We grew up thinking genders and relationships were fluid and it never harmed us.", "NTA. It's sad this is even a question. Petition for some sex education at school or something.", "NTA. It's nice your mom is making an attempt to let you do your own thing. But ask her if she bans every Disney movie or movie with any romantic pairing.\n\nHeterosexuality is show constantly since we are very young. Just saying that you can also like someone who's your same gender isn't any more inappropriate.", "NTA  \nI'm quite conservative and even I can see that you only gave him a simple, age appropriate explanation and no details. Your answer was far better than lies or, even worse, leaving him to his own imagination.", "NTA, but your mother is.  bummer.", "Of course you're NTA. You didn't talk about your sex life, your mother only thinks it's inappropriate because of her bigoted beliefs. Children can be gay just like children can be straight, people of all sexualities start developing feelings as children.", "NTA\n\nSorry but by 9 years old a LOT of people know already that they're gay/want to date or marry same-gender folks. This poor kid having to ask you at age NINE when a ton of his peers probably already know way too much at their age.", "NTA.   My daughter was 5 when I told her some men like women, some women like men, some men like men, and some women like women, and isn't that great that everybody gets to love who they want to love?  She thought it was pretty neat too. Then we turned on \"The Birdcage\"  and danced.  \n\nThat's a condensed version of how I explained it to her, but you get the basic idea.  I told her  just as naturally and simply as I could. And to her, relationships of all types have been very natural ever since. She's 20 now. You didn't do anything wrong - your little brother was old enough to hear it.", "NTA. Your mother is an asshole.", "Why do some people think all things gay are inherently sexual? She's reactinglike you described explicit sex stuff to him, which you didn't. It's the same as a straight person explaining a kid who his partner is and what does the word dating mean. NTA, you'r mom is and she needs to work to move from that homophobia if she doesn't want to be a bad influence for your brother.", "NTA. If it's inappropriate for you to explain who your boyfriend is to your brother, then it's also inappropriate for your mom to explain who her husband/boyfriend/baby daddy is. Also remind her that she better not be explaining who any of her hetero friends' husbands/bf/gf/wives are because according to her logic that is also inappropriate for a 9 yr old", "NTA Your mum is a bigot. When my then 6 year old brother asked why I didn't have a boyfriend and I told him I like girls my mum didn't give a toss. Except she found his reply of \"why don't you have a girlfriend then? I have one and I'm 6\" completely hilarious. Your mum shouldn't have cared that he found out boys can like boys because at 9 any level of liking is completely innocent. There is nothing inappropriate in the knowledge unless you believe there is something inappropriate in being gay.", "NTA. That is absolutely disgusting that your mother would think this.", "She shelters him from ALOT (unsurprising\u2026)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe used to be incredibly worried sending him to a public school simply because she was worried he would learn things (that are okay) at school.", "I mean come one.. I knew a lot more at nine. A LOT. MORE.", "When my oldest was in kindergarten he came home and told me that being gay was bad! I'm like, nope, not raising you like that, hell, he'd been to a wedding where it was 2 brides. We had a nice chat about what being gay meant and how it's not bad at all. The next day he went to school and tried to convince the classmate who told him that it was bad that it wasn't. He was quite upset that the classmate wouldn't change their mind.\n\nNow he's 11 and recently my friend's kid came out to him as pan and non-binary before coming out to us or their parents. He handled it perfectly, didn't say anything to us until after they were comfortable with it, even though he knew that none of us would reject them, that we'd all be supportive.", "[removed]", "You've confused genital preference for sexuality. Genital preference is the equipment you want to fuck while sexuality is the people you want to fuck, it's more than genitals. And romantic orientation is often tied with sexual orientation.
