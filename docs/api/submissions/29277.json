Your mother is crazy homophobic. However, she might be less accepting of your boyfriend, after this.", "Nta. I've taught my kid(gently) about the lgbqt community since preschool when she wanted to know why a boy in class has 2 moms. She is 10 now and I can promise that if your brother is in school, he's heard about it from other kids. If not descriptions, then at least the word. In my experience is usually used among the kids as an insult \"stop being gay\" \"you're gay\". I've told her that when she hears that to let them know being gay isn't bad, but using it as an insult is. We have gay family and friends. I did also tell her that if she feels uncomfortable to just walk away, which she does usually, but she also did form an anti bullying group that includes not making fun of the gay community. You shouldn't have to hide who you are to your brother. It's not like you're being sexual in front of him.

When my little tiny niece asked me if I had a wife, I said no, I am a wife, I am your uncle's wife. He is my husband. But there are some families that have two wives or two husbands too. Sometimes we call them all spouses, which means the same as husband or wife but isn't because they are a boy or girl. I think answering the way you did was simple and to the point. If a child asks a question, they already sort of have an idea about what they are asking. It's best if they get a reasonable answer and no one gets mad about it.", "NTA\n\nLet's hope mom never has to explain why she married your dad!\n\nBut seriously, assuming anything queer is automatically inappropriate is just so harmful.", "NTA.

Sometimes boys like boys and sometimes girls like girls and it's ok.\" If you treat it as normal and no big deal, so will they. The problem is with homophobic parents who WANT it to be a weird scary thing.", "NTA. Spread the love. Your mom is wrong. Moms can be wrong, even and especially about their own children. Help your brother out and make sure he doesn\u2019t pick up your mom\u2019s bigotry. And who knows, he may be gay too, but either way, continue to support your brother and prepare him for the world. Gay people exist. And it\u2019s not inappropriate.", "NTA.\n\nYou were just informing him in a completely appropriate way.  Your mom seems pretty damn accepting if she respects your boyfriend.  She probably has all kinds of incorrect assumptions about sexual identities.  \n\nSomething similar happened with my sister-in-law and my niece (when she was around the same age as your bro), when at one point my niece asked her if I was gay.  My sister-in-law said, \"Yes.\"  And my niece repsonded, \"Mom, you're not supposed to tell me that!\"  \n\nI thought it was funny that my niece thought my sister-in-law outed me.  For the record, my sister-in-law is pretty conservative and Christian, but has fewer issues with my sexual identity than my actual brother does.", "NTA. God made different races, different sexual orientations, and different gender identities. That is God\u2019s truth. God didn\u2019t make the Bible or any other religion. If he\u2019s old enough to understand boyfriend/girlfriend, he\u2019s old enough to understand boyfriend/boyfriend and girlfriend/girlfriend.
