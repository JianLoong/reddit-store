{"id": 4705, "submission_id": "zlsu8h", "title": "AITA for not wanting to be around my future brother in law?", "selftext": "My future brother in law (29M) wanted me (22F) to drive him around to job hunt a few days ago. I really enjoy hanging out with him, so I thought it would be a great idea.  He seemed excited, so I was excited. The day came, we grabbed a coffee and drove around. We were laughing and having great conversations. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be able to find a job today.\u201d  \u201cThat\u2019s no problem!  I had the day off, so I don\u2019t mind just chilling. It\u2019s whatever you want to do, man :)\u201d He then flipped a switch\u2026 \u201cWill you just chill out!?  Can you stop being nice?!  I don\u2019t get you!\u201d  His voice was raising and I was in complete shock, \u201cYou are weirding me out!  Just say something mean!  I don\u2019t need your pity!\u201d  I was silent for a few moments because I had no idea where that came from or even how to react to that.  I told him very plainly, \u201cI don\u2019t pity you whatsoever and I\u2019m sorry if it ever came off that way. I was just happy to hang out with you and I don\u2019t care if you get a job or not.  I\u2019m not looking down/pitying you at all.\u201d  Then he stopped raising his voice and told me how he felt, \u201cYou are too nice and it\u2019s weird.  Everything I\u2019m going to tell you is completely serious. I don\u2019t want to hang out ever. I don\u2019t want a friend.  I hate everyone, except I don\u2019t mind [insert my fianc\u00e9s name here].  I hate having to interact.  Let\u2019s just drive downtown.\u201d  He started telling me where to drive and I was still frazzled. People have been mean to me many times before, but no one has ever talked to me like that.  I casually tried to drive back to his place so this could be over, but he kept telling me where to turn so we could still drive around.  I eventually broke the silence and said, \u201cI know that our lives are very different and I could never completely relate to how you feel, but I do know what it\u2019s like to hate everyone. There was a time in my life where I didn\u2019t want to live and I hated every person with all my being. I was depressed and\u2026\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not depressed!  I am completely content with who I am. You don\u2019t understand how I feel at all.\u201d  I stopped talking.  After about 10 minutes he made some comments here and there about the stores and buildings like nothing ever happened. He asked me to take him to the mall and walk around for a bit. We did all of that and tried to make small talk before I eventually took him home. I don\u2019t know what I did to bring about that kind of reaction.  I reluctantly told me fianc\u00e9 and he has now decided that he doesn\u2019t want him to be his best man at our wedding. I told him not to do that for me because I don\u2019t want something that doesn\u2019t involve my fianc\u00e9 to affect his relationship with his brother. I\u2019m at a loss for what to do.\n\nUpdate: My fianc\u00e9 called his brother and was a bit shifty when asked what happen.  He did end up saying that he has no interest in hanging out anymore. Essentially what was said.  My fianc\u00e9 did not mention the best man stuff quite yet as he\u2019s still trying to find the best way to go about it. I feel very blessed that he is such a supportive future husband.\nThank you guys for the support and responses <3", "created_utc": 1671029191, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlsu8h/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_around_my_future/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your future BIL sounds a little unhinged and honestly I\u2019d encourage you to not be alone with him in the future. \n\nAlso, you should know that whatever happens to you does involve your fianc\u00e9, especially once you\u2019re married and *especially* if it concerns his family. Imagine if you had a sibling who said such things to your fianc\u00e9, and who acted that way. Would you want your sibling involved in your wedding if they made your fianc\u00e9 that uncomfortable? Wouldn\u2019t you want to stand up for your fianc\u00e9?", "NTA. It is your fianc\u00e9s prerogative to not make him best man though. He essentially told you he hates you while you were doing something very nice for him and then you still tried to fix it? Also not really an asshole for not wanting to hang out with someone who said that kinda stuff", "NTA but I'm glad you told your fianc\u00e9. It's a good sign that he is on your side. Was he surprised by what his brother did? If not maybe he knows what his brother can be like.\n\nIt's up to you and your fianc\u00e9 to decide if your BIL is in the wedding. I get that you don't want to cause an issue but it's not you who caused it. Talk to your fianc\u00e9 and decide. If you decide to let BIL be in the wedding party that's fine too. Just don't be alone with him he's made it clear he doesn't want that and your fianc\u00e9 knows it so BIL can't backtrack.", "Your fiance saying he doesn't want his brother in the wedding anymore, is his choice. However, I wonder if he knows something about that brother that you don't. I mean he's 29 years old looking for a job hates people hates everybody doesn't want to talk to anybody...... Sounds like a mental issue to me. Just saying food for thought.", "NTA. \n\nThat is deeply offputting and I can't imagine who wouldn't feel the way you do.", "Nta and nice to see that your fiancee is supporting you.", "NTA. It sounds a bit creepy tbh.", "NTA and your fianc\u00e9 made the choice to back out of the wedding. Future BIL\u2019s behavior was just weird!! He wanted you  take take home job hunting but that admits he doesn\u2019t like you or want to hang out with you. But instead of cutting the day short (which i would of done immediately) he wants to continue driving around and go to the mall. Like WTF? I\u2019m so confused at his behavior! You were right to tell your fianc\u00e9 and he has the right to make his own decision about their wedding. I do think he needs to talk to his brother though and see if he could get to the bottom of this off-the-wall behavior", "NTA I commend you for not losing your temper and arguing back, then continuing to drive him around after that verbal attack and hurtful comments being slung at you. \n\nTo me, it sounds like he\u2019s dealing with, at the very least, some conflicting emotions. But truly it sounds more like some kind of mental illness. As you suggested, depression, but maybe also ADHD or bipolar where those kinds of behaviors and mood swings are part of the illness. Perhaps there\u2019s an anxiety disorder where he is having a panic attack in the form of lashing out. \n\nUntil he\u2019s ready to get help for himself, there is nothing you can do that you haven\u2019t been doing. You\u2019re justified to set boundaries to stay away from him after he was so rude and mean to you. What he did was verbal and emotional abuse. IT\u2019s domestic abuse. \n\nFurthermore, He also made it clear he doesn\u2019t want to be your friend. So you also need to respect the boundary he just set as well. Next time he asks for something, you can say no, guilt free, because you\u2019re respecting the boundaries each of you have set in regards to him. \n\nAs for your fianc\u00e9. I have to appreciate a man who\u2019s putting his partner and future wife ahead of his family. I see so many times, just the opposite occurs and the SO is often blamed or ridiculed instead of holding accountable the person who the blame truly lies with. Your fianc\u00e9 should be putting you first and supporting you. While I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s completely necessary to remove him from the wedding party just yet, I would suggest that your fianc\u00e9 has a talk with his brother to hear his side of things to find out why he behaved the way he did towards you. There may be more to the story than you know. Then your fianc\u00e9 can use that conversation to set his boundary to say that verbally and emotionally abusing you will not be tolerated by him and If the brother continues to do so, then he will be removed from the wedding and contact will be limited.", "NTA at all.\n\nIn fact, you'd be following his wishes as he seems to not want any interaction.\n\nAlso, I think someone else mentioned it, but if that made your fiance drop him as a best man (I would have too) I wonder if the best man role was his brother's last chance to stop being an ass to the family?  \nHowever, that's unfounded speculation based on my own personal life experiences, so my biases must be considered as well", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
