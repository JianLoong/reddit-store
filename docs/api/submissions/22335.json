My sister lives in another state so I don\u2019t get to see them a lot. I want to give a little back story on the type of person my sister was growing up so y\u2019all can understand where I\u2019m coming from. \n\nWhen I was younger my sister was always very controlling in what I did. It was like I could never do anything right or have an opinion for myself without her being mad at me. It was like she support me in the hobbies she enjoyed I had but would shame for the things she didn\u2019t like. \n\nNow to go back to last week. Last week we were having a family gathering. I have a kid if my own that is nine now. He has some behavioral issues and can become very irritable very quickly. We try to let him live a free life that he doesn\u2019t explode on me and my wife when we need him to listen. The problem is that at family dinners and stuff of the sort, he needs to follow a lot more rules than before. So he can be a handful in certain settings.\n\nWhile my son what struggling to sit at the table, my mother fuel to the fire. \u201cYour sisters kids seem to be a lot more behaved than yours. Maybe you should be a little stricter like her.\u201d. This is where I kinda messed up in my harshness. \u201cThe only reason her kids listen to her is because they a threatened by her and they only listen because they\u2019re scared. She\u2019s not a good mom she\u2019s a good owner\u201d. I know it\u2019s a little fucked up but I meant every word of what I said. My sister said \u201cI love my kids but I don\u2019t see you enough for you to make such an impression on how I treat my kids\u201d. Her kids said nothing the whole family gathering and just played in a corner. That\u2019s not what kids do. I know my sister and I know that she probably has deprived them of a good social life and scared them into not having any sort of a personality. I refuse let my mom compare me to someone like that just because my kids is having a hard time.\n\nMy sons birthday is in two weeks and since his god mother is my sister, she was planning it. After our argument, I told her that she doesn\u2019t need to plan anything and to just drop off her kids. She (again) was upset with me not doing whatever she wants. She told me that I was being selfish for restricting relationships with an aunt that he loves and that I wasted all of the money she spent on presents, decorations, cakes, and surprises. I told her that once she learns to be a good mother, she can be around my kids.

What I\u2019m really reading is that you don\u2019t set limits, rules, or expectations on your son because any time you do he acts out. That\u2019s called parenting. \n\nWe don\u2019t know enough about how your sister actually parents her kids to make a judgement about that, but it sounds like she is an interested, involved aunt and you\u2019re acting out about your perceived childhood slights, not the current situation. So for that.YTA.", "YTA. \n\nJFC man. People aren't who they were as children. You don't see your sister often. You don't know how she parents. She's right about that. \n\nShe didn't do anything to you, it was your mother who attacked you. Why the fuck are you attacking someone else instead of directing your anger at your mom? You know, the person who ACTUALLY insulted you?\n\nWhat argument? Your sister didn't argue with you, she just stood up for herself and set boundaries.", "I might be biased here, but I feel like YTA since you don't actually know how she is as a mother. \n\nIt's possible that she is controlling or/and harsh to the kids, but just from reading this, I don't think your mother was completely wrong or super rude. \n\nThink about why your mother said stung, and why you felt the need to defend yourself. Have you looked into why your child has behavioral issues or how to calm him down?

That\u2019s not what kids do.\n\nI feel like that's not true. My cousins are like that, they mind their own business instead of engaging with the adults at gatherings. Not all kids are like that for sure, but some definitely are.", "YTA you are projecting your own issues onto your own uninformed view of how she is as a parent. Just bc her kids are well behaved and she was annoying and bossy growing up doesn't mean that she is a heartless mom who disciplines and nothing else. That is an insane leap of logic.", "YTA. \n\nIf your kid struggled to even sit at a family dinner without being disruptive then he obviously isn\u2019t being raised with manners and you should maybe reevaluate the total lack of boundaries at home. \n\nYour sister wasn\u2019t even the one to criticize your parenting but you attacked hers. And then on top of that you punished her for having children that were capable of playing quietly when you had obviously previously given her permission to plan the party. And you owe her the money that she wasted on the party plans so far.", "YTA. \n\nYou don't know how she is as a mother. You just know that her kids are better behaved than yours. You're insecure about that, so you insulted her. Cutting her off is also a reflection of your insecurity, not about anything she said or did to you or your son.", "Yes, YTA.   It doesn't sound like you're in any kind of position to be criticizing other people's parenting.", "Yta, you upset with your sister  because  she doesn't  let her kids run amuck while you let yours be bad and run over you that's your fault not hers, that your mother noticed  you dont even know how she parent  to judge her", "YTA. Your sister didn\u2019t say anything to you about your parenting style, your mom did. I think it struck a nerve because you realize your \u201cfree\u201d parenting (whatever that means) sucks. You know that your child is a brat and it\u2019s because you and your wife are too scared to parent him because he\u2019ll \u201cexplode\u201d on you. You\u2019re cowed by a 9 year old. When you see your sister who you obviously resent have well behaved children, you know how badly you\u2019ve been failing your kid. Instead of pointing your anger at yourself where it belongs, you \u201cexplode\u201d (wonder where he gets that from) at her when she didn\u2019t do anything. YTA and you should apologize.", "YTA\nYou have problems you should deal with on your own first. Your sister reacted like a grownup to a terribly hurtful thing you said. And guess what, just because your kid doesn't calmly play, doesn't mean other kids don't. Some kids are more energetic than others and that's fine. All of them do need structure and boundaries though.", "YTA - You could have handled your mother (also TA) without attacking your sister", "YTA \u201cyour kids are well behaved and mine is not. You must be a bad parent!\u201d This makes no sense\u2026 your sister didn\u2019t do anything to deserve your punishment. Also you shouldn\u2019t hold what she did as a kid against her as an adult. If she were that controlling and overbearing it would have been her telling you that your a bad parent rather then your mom. Also she handled your unnecessary insult like an adult instead of throwing insults back at you. So I\u2019m with your mom here you can definitely learn a bit from your sister.", "YTA- People will despise you and your kid at restaurants.", "YTA you can have very well behaved kids with out thawing to threaten them all the time. It\u2019s called parenting! \n\nYou may walk on eggshells to keep your precious baby boy for becoming angry and violent but the world will not and doesn\u2019t have too.\n\nDo you want to know what will happen when your precious gift of Terri\u2019s hurts another kid or a teacher at school because he can\u2019t be his normal terror self.

Teach your child to control his temper and to follow rules. No one else wants to deal with the monster you are creating.", "YTA. You know so little about your sister's parenting you can't even tell us how old her children are. They're your nephews !  \n\nYou can't control your kid at a family function, so you strike out at her. Sad.", "YTA for making statements that aren't true about your sister because you were mad at your mother. You owe them both apologies.", "YTA. How exactly were you planning to measure when she became a good enough mom? Good enough to throw a birthday party for YOUR kid?", "Bro\u2026 how do you have mommy issues, but with your *sister*? \n\nYTA. your sister didn\u2019t even say anything to you and you started spewing baseless insults.", "YTA You\u2019re mad bc your mom said your sister\u2019s kids are better behaved than yours. Instead of standing up for yourself & your kid, you decided to insult your sister. That makes you an AH.\n\nIt\u2019s weird that you dislike her so intensely but made her the godmother to your son. Also weird that this woman who you have decided treats her kids like dogs was planning your son\u2019s birthday party and is actively upset that you\u2019re keeping her from seeing your son.\n\nNothing in your post indicates that your sister is mean to your kid. In fact, nothing in your post indicates that you\u2019ve ever seen your sister be mean to her own kids. \n\nYou\u2019re clearly really bitter, and I guess calling your sister a bad mother makes you feel better - but her kids are well-behaved. Just ask your mom.", "YTA. You made a judgment on your sister's parenting based on your seeing her kids playing quietly in a corner? That's not enough to make a judgment! And calling a parent who parents differently than you an \"owner\" if they're not abusive is hella outrageous. You're taking childhood frustrations out on your sister and making huge assumptions about her relationship with her kids based on how teenaged her treated pre-teen you in order to justify how her kids behave vs how your kid behaves. Even kids with behavior issues need to learn to follow non-harmful rules and get along in social settings. I haven't met your kid or seen his behavior, so I don't know if you're providing him with those boundaries and guidance or not, but regardless, nothing you said demonstrates that your sister is a \"bad mom.\" \n\nYour sister being upset that you are suddenly cutting her out of your kid's life and you are not wanting her to plan the birthday party isn't controlling; it's valid! She DID already spend $ and time to plan the party. Your son DOES deserve to have a positive relationship with his aunt even if you don't like her. \n\nWhile your mom shouldn't have compared your kids, it's okay for both of you to have different parenting styles and your kids to behave differently without you jumping down your sister's throat. This whole thing reeks of you having some unresolved resentments against your sister that colors how you see everything about her in an irrational way.", "Your mom was out of line because she criticized your parenting without being asked to share her opinion. You turned around and did the same thing to your sister. YTA and so is your mother.", "ESH, but you more than her.  She was a bad sister, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's a bad mother.  A four- or six-year-old who doesn't see the rest of the family often will probably be pretty quiet.  Also, a 9-year-old should be able to sit at a table and eat a meal without being a \"handful.\"\n\nThat being said, I'm going ESH because she accused you of being selfish and trying to guilt you over a partially planned party.", "ESH. Firstly it sounds like your son may have ADHD or ASD if he has trouble sitting still at the table and regulating his emotions. Which makes your MOM the ableist A-H for comparing you and your sisters parenting. You definitely took this out on the wrong person.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
