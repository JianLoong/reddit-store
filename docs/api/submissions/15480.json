It turned out he hasn\u2019t cooked a single meal during those 3 days, only takeout.\n\nWhen he was going to the pharmacy I asked him to stop by a shop next to it to buy some fruit and to check if we have all ingredients for a meal I decided to cook for us to have something to eat until Monday. He hasn\u2019t read the list very well and forgot one of the main ingredients.\n\nAt this point something died inside of me a little bit. I realized this man can\u2019t even be trusted to be left with a potential pet or a child, because he needs to be told everything he is supposed to do beforehand.\n\nDid I really expect too much of him? AITA?\n\nEdit: some chore info\n\nI usually do the groceries, but we split the cooking about 50/50. We plan the meals together but I\u2019m usually the initiator of that process. I simply expected him to plan a staple meal for me to cook and 2 meals for him to cook. \n\nHe only planned the one I exclusively asked him to cook. If not for me telling him to buy some ingredients as a part of the pharmacy trip I would have been forced to go grocery shopping Monday morning before work.\n\nEdit 2:\nAll right I\u2019m leaving this post and not replying anymore. The misogyny is absurd.\n\nThank you to everyone understanding that I asked this question from the perspective of shared responsibility and mental load, not from a perspective of a woman who treats her boyfriend like a child who needs a list of things to do to around the house. From that perspective obviously it\u2019s very easy to blame me.\n\nIt seems like y\u2019all think a woman can\u2019t go away for 3 days without covering every common sense case there is or else the poor man will get lost.\n\nTo everyone saying it\u2019s my chore: my bf\u2019s chore is washing the dishes, so y\u2019all are saying if he was gone for 3 days I should leave it all for him to clean up after he comes back?

Household tasks are cleaning and washing up, not cooking for several days in advance. You really can't blame him for *not* eating something. \n\nIt sounds like you came home to him having done exactly what you asked, you blew up because he couldn't read your mind.

With you out of town for three days, you didn't have the chance to do the meal-planning. If I were the boyfriend, I would have waited for your return, too, before buying ingredients for meals that you might not want to eat that weekend.\n\nCould he have thought ahead?

Quite mean behaviour", "Slight YTA.   \n\n\nIf this is a first time thing, I'll retract my statement. This is just a personal gripe of mine, always has been, when people are overly hands-on, especially when it comes down to very niche things. He heeded your words and he prepared the meal, and even the best of us tend to forget something on a grocery list, heck, I often write them, leave for the store and when  get there, I didn't even bring the damn list. When it comes to not cooking, I mean.. let's be real here, he probably took those 3 days off and enjoyed his freedom a little, no disrespect to you, don't get me wrong. I'm 27 and I have plenty of male friends that live by themselves, or with girlfriends and if you'd let them,  they'd never touch a goddamn stove, ever. So... this is just men being men, you cannot expect someone to eat exactly what is stored in  your fridge or cupboards. If he was in the mood for take-out, let him enjoy take-out, especially since you plan meals ahead of time\u2014he took a load off and went the lazy road for a while, no harm there.  \n\n\nThe spoilt food is another thing, that is just irresponsible. It would've taken only a few minutes to remove the items and throw them out, but then again, I'm wondering what you were storing in the fridge that could have spoilt in such a short time-frame.. were they left-overs from previous meals or maybe fruits?   \n\n\nI'd say you're overthinking the situation, and maybe you just have a bf that is the lazy type when you're not around. We all have those moments when we say: fuck it, tomorrow. And then tomorrow arrives and we say:... ehh, tomorrow. You catch my drift.

Hopefully he brings other strengths to the relationship.", "ESH. \n\nYou've keep saying here that it was common sense he should have realised that he'd need to do these things, but what might seem like common sense to you is not necessarily common sense to someone else. Better communication of expectations and requirements would have helped. And stating you can't trust the guy with a potential pet or child after blaming him for missing one ingredient, even a key one for the dish you were planning, when it sounds like an unfortunate mistake, seems a bit extreme.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree with you that it was reasonable to expect if there was spoiled food in the fridge he could have cleared this out before you got home. \n\nGiven that where you live stores are closed Sundays, and the potential for things (like emergencies or illness) to crop up & prevent us from going shopping when we plan, it sounds like you would be best off having some store cupboard (tinned food etc) and/or frozen ingredients that you can get out when needed to, rather risk a repeat situation where you have nothing left in the house.", "I've been married for over 10 years. I do a majority of household chores. My husband leaves every year over Christmas to visit hi s family and when he is gone I just enjoy time alone sitting on the couch watching shows or gaming, I make a mess, I order takeout, I throw my clothes on the floor like a teenager. I could go with him, but I take the \"excuse\" of having to look after our cats and how hard it is to find a pet sitter over the holidays and blah blah blah, I like his family and they like but I LOVE my alone time. \n\nIt's great. I love my husband and obviously I'm excited for him to return home and I'm perfectly able to look after myself, pets, and potentially a child (even though we don't want any).

How I live when I'm \"home alone\" for a week does not reflect my personal hygiene, eating and tidiness standards. I clean up a bit before he returns tho. \n\nI can't be the only one. I'm sure if your boyfriend would live on his own, he would meal plan and cook and clean according to his standards, too. Maybe his standards are lower than yours. Maybe not.

Let the man enjoy his alone time and takeout and don't hover over him while he's on his own. \n\nI hope he apologized for forgetting to buy the main ingredients for the meal you had planned.

Before we had kids, if my spouse was away I would for sure look for ways not to cook. Because I'm not that into cooking, so cooking for one person is less efficient and feels more pointless than two. Also you're just creating cleanup for yourself, and I hate cleanup.

I have no issues with splitting the cooking 50/50, I simply thought he would have thought of buying the groceries.", "No shade on him for ordering takeout as long as he cleaned up the fridge.\n\nWe had some leftover hummus he didn\u2019t eat for breakfast/dinner so when I came back it was all watery and smelly and some milk which went bad.", "They meal plan together, of course he's going to wait for her to be home, so they can do that, before groceries are bought.", "We sit down together about 2 days before running out of food and plan the meals and we cook together. I usually cook meals for 2 days 2x a week and he cooks single day meals 2x a week. We usually order takeout once. I have to say I\u2019m usually the initiator.\n\nI exclusively do our groceries, he only goes to speciality stores about once every two weeks. That was the chore which needed to be taken over.\n\nHe could have planned two of our staple meals and we could have split the cooking. I wasn\u2019t expecting him to cook all 3 meals, simply to plan them and do the groceries.", "I never said I was mad about the takeout? I was upset he didn\u2019t eat the food we had or at least threw it away if he knew he wasn\u2019t going to eat it anymore.", "A silly assumption one will not expect someone to do the grocery shopping and meal planning right after coming back from a 3 day work thing?\n\nLet\u2019s swap the logic here. So my boyfriend rightfully assumed I\u2019d get back late on Friday and the first thing I\u2019d love to do the next morning would be meal planning and groceries? Not unpacking and such?", "Humans can\u2019t think 2 days in advance? What am I, his mother to tell him we\u2019d need to eat after I came home?", "I know you're not responding to comments anymore, but you are NTA. \n\nIf they turn into little baby idiots when we leave, then they were always little baby idiots, we just masked it for them. \n\nAdults are able to continue routine and chores without their partner present or to remind them. Otherwise, they are weaponizing incompetence or are just plain incompetent.", "NTA.\n\nBTW It's lose.    Loose is the opposite of tight.", "We had some leftover hummus and milk which went bad. He was well aware the hummus should have been thrown away. It was supposed to be his breakfast/dinner he simply didn\u2019t eat it.", "I've had food go fuzzy and moldy a few days after the due date.. We don't know what OPs fridge looks like. \n\nBut that's okay, you don't have to agree, it's an opinion sub after all", "The definitely NTA. You need to make sure this behaviour is fixed before you start planning having any kids, because that is the point in time when many men drop the ball completely.", "Spot on.", "Another comment sums this up well:\n\n\"If the genders were reversed here there would be exactly zero NTA votes. It's unbelievable how consistently inconsistent members of this sub tend to be.\n\n\n\"My girlfriend didn't cook meals for herself while I was gone and I'm furious. I demanded that she make me a specific meal upon my return from a trip. I am furious that she was too helpless, lazy, and stupid to buy groceries beyond that meal. Then I sent her to the store with a list that I composed and neglected to get one of the items I instructed her to purchase. She can't be trusted to be alone with children or pets. She's so stupid and irresponsible.\" \"\n\nIt sounds like OP is high maintainance. Who only has the very specific ingredients for one meal in the house? I highly doubt they were completely out of food to the extent that they were going to starve over the weekend. OP is just annoyed that her boyfriend had a relaxing few days without her and didn't keep the house running on her schedule. If she got back and neither of them wanted to go shopping, they could have had a takeaway or gone out for dinner. Where did he say that she had to go shopping before work? It's not like she came home and he said \"go shopping, slave, it's not my job\". He didn't say he wouldn't go shopping for her. He just didn't go out of his way to stock the fridge with food he wasn't planning to cook/eat while she was gone.\n\nAlso, from someone who grew up poor and now is reasonably well off, you can make a meal out of practically nothing if you try hard enough. I have weeks where I don't feel like shopping. It's amazing what you can do with dried pasta and a tin of tomatoes.", ">Yes indeed I assumed he wouldn\u2019t be expecting me to go grocery shopping right when I came back on Saturday. \n\nWhy would you assume that?", "But not everyone does think about the big picture. If those are things you normally do, it's no surprise that he forgot. If you're always on a rigid schedule, he was probably glad of 3 days to relax and eat junk for a little while. If you're *always* the initiator of the meal plan, it's probably far more your style than his. It was fair of you to ask him to go shopping, but you can't control what other people forget. He made a mistake with the list. That's not a crime. \n\nHave you considered having some ingredients frozen in case something like this happens? Tinned goods and frozen meat will keep forever, so there's no worry if there isn't time to go shopping.", "They meal plan together, of course he's going to wait to get the required ingredients.\n\n> If she did, people would have called her a controlling ah.\n\nDon't be silly.", "Again. Your entire reply is based on assumptions that you clearly didn\u2019t communicate. It\u2019s a fair thing to ask, but the problem is that you DIDNT. You failed to communicate and then blamed him for not reading your mind. You\u2019re not TA for wanting him to buy more groceries, but you\u2019re TA for having that expectation, not communicating it and then getting mad at him for it.", "Ah, alright. Yeah, I agreed on the fridge thing, definitely.", "It sounds like he's mostly a passenger with the cooking, and goes along with the routine, but it's not something he enjoys. Your mental places about it are difference, and hence your surprise when you got back.   \n\n\nPerhaps he'd prefer to divvy things up differently. For example, you handle the grocery shopping and cooking, and he washes every dish, and is in charge of laundry and taking out the garbage. For example.  Even if this is not a scheme you'd want to do, it'd be instructive to understand whether it's something he'd like to do.", "OP you hit the nail on the head1  You said that you're the initiator, and as well you're obviously the planner, so therefore he defers everything to you.  Unfortunately there's usually one in every couple that has to take \"the reins\" in the relationship (I was in my last relationship), and it was unbelievably exhausting.  For future reference I would just strongly suggest when you need to take off again, plan everything out in writing before leaving and do not leave him to his own devices.  He's not going to change, he's going to defer to you, and for peace of mind you each have your strengths to play to.", ">A silly assumption one will not expect someone to do the grocery shopping and meal planning right after coming back from a 3 day work thing?\n\nYes. Grocery shopping is your chore, and meal planning is a shared one. If you wanted help, you should've asked.\n\nHell, given you did ask, and he did go shopping... what on earth is your problem?\n\n>So my boyfriend rightfully assumed I\u2019d get back late on Friday and the first thing I\u2019d love to do the next morning would be meal planning and groceries?\n\nWho says you have to love your chores, lol? Who said you had to do it first thing? What on earth are you talking about? And by god, unpacking? It was a three day trip! How much do you need to unpack?\n\nIt's just poor excuse after poor excuse. Your behaviour was shitty.", "Some can\u2019t. I for one barely do that because of illness reasons. If anything you are overreacting. If you did not verbally communicate your expectations then don\u2019t expect him to know what you want. I also feel like something like this can be forgiven and instead of going on reddit to talk about what your partner did you should instead communicate the problem with him, not communicating these frustrations is unhealthy for a relationship.", "If he\u2019s this unable to reason simple things out now, or simply not arsed, I don\u2019t think he\u2019d be able to deal with a pet or kids. I think op has him clearly in view here. It\u2019s the old weaponised incompetence on display. \u2018You\u2019ll have to do everything because I\u2019m going to make it really difficult for you otherwise\u2019 no partner worth the title would expect every task to be spelled out fully, that\u2019s just not sustainable.  If I was inclined to try for kids, it would not be with this chap.  Someone else can have a go at fixing him, there\u2019s more out there in an unbroken condition for me to waste my time.", "OP said there was no fruit left, food gone bad in the fridge, and that he hadn't even thought of buying stuff for breakfast knowing she'd be back late, meaning she would have to run to the grocery store first thing in the morning to literally buy breakfast. \n\nThe problem was not the takeout, is that he neglected to do the basic things necessary to keep the house running properly, and in my book this includes having at least a day worth of food in the fridge, more if you know stores are going to be closed. \n\nExpecting to come back home and not having to do an emergency run to the grocery store because your partner didn't deign to buy basic necessities is not being high maintenance, and the gender assumption from the comment you quoted is exactly that: an assumption. \n\nIf you think OP is lying or exaggerating then provide your reasons, but if we go by what OP says in her post and comments, the state of their food supplies (and the spoiled food left in the fridge) when she got back is indeed unacceptable for a responsible adult.", "Because I was tired from the trip and we already had plans for Saturday?", "He know which meals we eat why wait for me?", "She she\u2019s the AH because she varies the mental load for the house? No. \nIt\u2019s true that people aren\u2019t mind readers, and there are scenarios where this logic applies, but this is about taking on equal mental responsibility for what the household needs. \nThere are some things you shouldn\u2019t have to consistently ask to be done\u2026 it\u2019s true boyfriend got stuff to make a nice meal but that was the minimum asked. Little things like this tend to add up over time, and from OPs responses, it sounds like it\u2019s getting close to being the straw that breaks the camels back.", "He likes cooking. I think it\u2019s him not doing the groceries usually which screwed it up. I do the groceries once, tops twice a week. He\u2019s a guy who\u2019ll realise there\u2019s nothing to eat so he\u2019ll go to the store literally every other day instead of planing in advance.\n\nI started asking him to plan the meals because at first I was the one running to the store every other day for him as it is my chore. I think about the whole thing - having something for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He doesn\u2019t have that skill. When I came back there was nothing to put on a slice of bread, that was also something I asked him to buy during the pharmacy trip.", "Y\u2019all really need to read up on mental load. It\u2019s ok for me to think about all of that stuff but God forbid my boyfriend would have been thoughtful and bought me some of my favourite food so I wouldn\u2019t have to come home to him only doing what I asked.", "You made plans when you're so tired you can't do grocery shopping? Why would you do that?\n\nGiven he went to the pharmacy and shopping on Saturday, seems those plans left plenty of time.\n\nC'mon, these are just awful excuses.", "So the meal planning is both this big mental load for you, but also, you just always eat the same things, so there's no actual planning?", "How does he know what meal you want to eat?", ">Y\u2019all really need to read up on mental load. It\u2019s ok for me to think about all of that stuff\n\n\"Grocery shopping is your chore, **and meal planning is a shared one.\"**\n\nDid you forget you already admitted you meal plan TOGETHER.\n\nYou asked whether you were an asshole. You have your answer. But, something tells me you were just seeking validation, and it hasn't gone your way.\n\nApologize to your boyfriend for being so insufferable and be better, dude.", "You really just came here for validation, didn't you?", "I literally only wanted some time to unpack on Saturday. We both went to afternoon plans. Those weren\u2019t only my plans.\n\nI don\u2019t expect someone who just came back from a work trip to hop back on their chores within 12 hours.", "Well, they have been living together, haven\u2019t they? He\u2019s an adult man, he knows what he eats.\n\nEven if this whole meal planing is such a complicated task that he can\u2019t perform, he still knows what he likes and eats during a day. He must have had a glimp of what\u2019s in the fridge after shopping. Nothing fancy, just  fruits, veggies, some just to be sure stuff like taco and pasta. \nAnd a home coming meal, so his gf knows she\u2019s welcome. \n\nBut this guy decided to stick to the bare minimum and not to think about the next day or what usually has been done.", "You\u2019re skipping the entire context of me being gone and the days after I came being the weekend, when the stores are closed on a Sunday.\n\nIf my boyfriend left and his chore is washing the dishes would it be ok for me then not to wash them for 3 days because it\u2019s his chore?", "You\u2019re right.

Dunno how OPs boyfriend eats but like, when I run out of food, I go to the shop and decide in the shop.", ">You\u2019re skipping the entire context of me being gone and the days after I came being the weekend, when the stores are closed on a Sunday.\r  \n\r\n\nNo, I'm not. We've addressed that. You got back Friday. There was a whole day you could shop.\n\nHell, given the boyfriend was the one who ended up shopping... what the hell are you complaining about? It's absurdity.\n\n>If my boyfriend left and his chore is washing the dishes would it be ok for me then not to wash them for 3 days because it\u2019s his chore?\n\nNo, for the same reason he was responsible for feeding himself while you wr gone.", "Jesus thank you. Everybody seems to be ok with a woman coming home and getting right to her chores, but God forbid the man would have thought 2 days in advance.", "Serious misandry vibes here."]}
