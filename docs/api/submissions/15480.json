It turned out he hasn\u2019t cooked a single meal during those 3 days, only takeout.\n\nWhen he was going to the pharmacy I asked him to stop by a shop next to it to buy some fruit and to check if we have all ingredients for a meal I decided to cook for us to have something to eat until Monday. He hasn\u2019t read the list very well and forgot one of the main ingredients.\n\nAt this point something died inside of me a little bit. I realized this man can\u2019t even be trusted to be left with a potential pet or a child, because he needs to be told everything he is supposed to do beforehand.\n\nDid I really expect too much of him? AITA?\n\nEdit: some chore info\n\nI usually do the groceries, but we split the cooking about 50/50. We plan the meals together but I\u2019m usually the initiator of that process. I simply expected him to plan a staple meal for me to cook and 2 meals for him to cook. \n\nHe only planned the one I exclusively asked him to cook. If not for me telling him to buy some ingredients as a part of the pharmacy trip I would have been forced to go grocery shopping Monday morning before work.\n\nEdit 2:\nAll right I\u2019m leaving this post and not replying anymore. The misogyny is absurd.\n\nThank you to everyone understanding that I asked this question from the perspective of shared responsibility and mental load, not from a perspective of a woman who treats her boyfriend like a child who needs a list of things to do to around the house.

This is just a personal gripe of mine, always has been, when people are overly hands-on, especially when it comes down to very niche things. He heeded your words and he prepared the meal, and even the best of us tend to forget something on a grocery list, heck, I often write them, leave for the store and when  get there, I didn't even bring the damn list. When it comes to not cooking, I mean.. let's be real here, he probably took those 3 days off and enjoyed his freedom a little, no disrespect to you, don't get me wrong. I'm 27 and I have plenty of male friends that live by themselves, or with girlfriends and if you'd let them,  they'd never touch a goddamn stove, ever. So... this is just men being men, you cannot expect someone to eat exactly what is stored in  your fridge or cupboards. If he was in the mood for take-out, let him enjoy take-out, especially since you plan meals ahead of time\u2014he took a load off and went the lazy road for a while, no harm there.  \n\n\nThe spoilt food is another thing, that is just irresponsible. It would've taken only a few minutes to remove the items and throw them out, but then again, I'm wondering what you were storing in the fridge that could have spoilt in such a short time-frame.. were they left-overs from previous meals or maybe fruits?   \n\n\nI'd say you're overthinking the situation, and maybe you just have a bf that is the lazy type when you're not around. We all have those moments when we say: fuck it, tomorrow. And then tomorrow arrives and we say:... ehh, tomorrow. You catch my drift. I think he didn't have any ill intent toward you, and he didn't do it to spite you. You can share your disappointment, sure, but this is nothing to get worked up about imo. Just my two cents worth, have a good one.", "Nta.  Leave him.  Why would you want to be with someone who can't do anything without being told too?

I sure  hope you didn't have to clean the fridge after coming home from a 3 day work trip.", "INFO: how are the cooking chores normally divided?\n\nIf cooking is not something he normally does, then it's probably because he doesn't like cooking, and will do the minimum asked of him in that regard (the meal for when you came home).   Hopefully he brings other strengths to the relationship.  \n\n\nEDIT: can someone explain why this musing about OP's situation is downvoted? Was the question rude or inappropriate or moronic?", "ESH.\n\nYou've keep saying here that it was common sense he should have realised that he'd need to do these things, but what might seem like common sense to you is not necessarily common sense to someone else. Better communication of expectations and requirements would have helped. And stating you can't trust the guy with a potential pet or child after blaming him for missing one ingredient, even a key one for the dish you were planning, when it sounds like an unfortunate mistake, seems a bit extreme.\n\nOn the other hand, I agree with you that it was reasonable to expect if there was spoiled food in the fridge he could have cleared this out before you got home.\n\nGiven that where you live stores are closed Sundays, and the potential for things (like emergencies or illness) to crop up & prevent us from going shopping when we plan, it sounds like you would be best off having some store cupboard (tinned food etc) and/or frozen ingredients that you can get out when needed to, rather risk a repeat situation where you have nothing left in the house.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEta: With regards my common sense comment.... Yes, the phrase common sense indicates all should understand it. But actually, not everyone has the same definition of common sense and one person's idea of common sense may differ from another persons. Common sense is influenced by our experiences. \n\nSo okay, there were no stores open on Sundays. But unless there are also no takeaways or restaurants open on Sundays, perhaps OP's boyfriend presumed that they would go out for a meal, or order in. Especially since OP said they normally meal plan together but she is the instigator. Since it wasn't mentioned, OP's boyfriend might either have not considered it, or presumed OP had other plans. And that is why I said better communication would have helped. And I would note, I am not saying the responsibility for communication lies solely with OP. Communication is a two-way street.", "I've been married for over 10 years. I do a majority of household chores. My husband leaves every year over Christmas to visit hi s family and when he is gone I just enjoy time alone sitting on the couch watching shows or gaming, I make a mess, I order takeout, I throw my clothes on the floor like a teenager.

Also you're just creating cleanup for yourself, and I hate cleanup.

A reasonable assumption is that this weekly meal plan covers Monday to Sunday. If OP came back on Friday night after 3 days, she left on Wednesday. If her boyfriend ate nothing but takeaways, then OP must have left the house with no food in the middle of the week despite having made a meal plan. She admits that she is the one that usually goes shopping, which means that she was the one who didn't buy enough food. The bf didn't intend to follow the meal plan, so he didn't check if the ingredients were stocked up.\n\nOP said that she got back on Friday night and would have to go to the shop before work on Monday morning. This suggests to me that they had enough food in the house that they didn't need to go shopping on Saturday.\n\nI'm saying again that OP did not have to go to the shop. She could have asked the bf to do it. In fact, she *did* send her bf to the shop. If all the boyfriend had eaten since she went away was take away (and apparently fruit), then how would he have known there was no food if OP didn't communicate this to him? And if there was so little food in the house that they couldn't last the weekend, then why did she only send him for ingredients for *one* meal?\n\nYou keep saying that he's not functioning as an adult, but other than forgetting to freeze/throw away leftovers, the bf didn't do anything wrong. OP came home to a nice home cooked meal and was only upset because the ingredients for the meal she wanted to cook weren't in the house. If there was no food for breakfast, why didn't she ask him to buy breakfast food for Sunday morning when she sent him shopping on Saturday?", "Excuse me, but how can you not know that food is running out *in your own house*.\n\nHow can you not imagine that if a person goes away for three days and comes back at the weekend, then the food that was bought for the week is obviously running out, and someone needs to buy some? \n\nIs it something that really needs to be spelled out? \n\nOP only said that she sent her boyfriend to the grocery store with a list of things to buy, she didn't specify what they were for, but she did say in another comment that he hadn't even bought stuff for breakfast, meaning, at best, that either there was food left only for Saturday morning, and not for the rest of the weekend/Monday, or that there was little to no food left for breakfast. He also ate the remaining fruit and didn't think to replace it. That's honestly such a shortsighted way to organise a shared household. \n\nI get that going shopping is her chore, but as I said, if you realise that food is running out you're not supposed to just let it run out, or almost run out, just because the person who usually does that chore isn't there to do it.", "In a normal situation, obviously, you would notice the absence of food. As it is, she left for 3 days and he decided to relax the rules. He didn't eat any home cooked meals and therefore didn't realise that she hadn't bought enough food to last the week. It was an assumption on his part that, as the shopping had been done that week and he hadn't eaten any of it since Wednesday, there would be enough left over. He then went out and bought the food she requested for a special meal.\n\nNowhere have I said that she's the AH because shopping is her chore. I've said multiple times that sending him to the shops was a reasonable thing to do. What isn't reasonable, is to suggest that because he decided to be a bit slovenly for the 3 days' worth of alone time he had, and therefore didn't think about what food was in the house, that he is an incompetent human being overall.\n\nOP isn't an AH for not going shopping, or for sending him shopping, or for anything to do with her chores. OP is TA because instead of communicating her annoyance to her bf, she has called him all sorts of horrible things and then posted about him on the internet. Most of this problem could have been solved with more communication on both parts. If she had told him she wasn't buying a week's worth of food, he would have known. If he had told her he wasn't planning to cook, she would have known. If she had told him she was only buying food for up to Wednesday and he hadn't bothered to make sure there was food for the weekend, he would have been TA.\n\nOP also never mentions if the bf works. If she normally shops at a time that is convenient for her, how do we even know that the bf had time to shop? If she can't shop before work, why is it fair to expect him to?", "If he lived alone he'd have to find time to do the shopping, wouldn't he? He can't live on takeout alone. \n\n100% of humans eventually have to manage grocery shopping and having a job, I still have to see a normally functioning human being unable to find the time to do basic grocery shopping while having a job. \n\nOP's whole complaint is her boyfriend's lack of care and attention to the household when she was away, she feels like she's a mother and not a partner.\n\nEven if he didn't open the fridge for three days, which is already problematic because he had been told there was food that needed to be eaten, otherwise it would spoil, it's really not excessive to expect a grown man to put two and two together and realise that, if they shop weekly, the END of the week is the time to replenish your food supplies. Does he think food magically appears in his house? \n\nThe fact that he didn't think about this on his own, and that he needed to be told by his girlfriend that food was scarce is what makes him immature and unreliable. He didn't worry about food, he finished stuff and didn't replace it, and he also let food go bad without even bothering to throw it away. \n\nThat's the behaviour of a guy who, at least to an extent, expects to be babysat.", "I'm not saying that this is an acceptable way to live as an adult. I'm saying that this was a 3 day break from *having* to be an adult. If he lived alone, he might have done the shopping on the weekends. You can't extrapolate the data from 3 days of laziness to an entire adulthood. He was irresponsible for a few days. That doesn't mean that if he was living on his own, he'd be incapable of looking after himself. He didn't do the shopping because he didn't think he had to. A little communication would have kept everyone much happier.\n\nObviously, OP couldn't have predicted how he was going to respond to being left alone. The claim that he would be unfit to look after a dog, however, is unfounded. His response was to being left alone for the first time in a while, without any responsibilities. He very likely would not have acted the same way if left with another person or animal to care for. Also, many people are immature before they become parents. That doesn't mean they make bad parents when the situation changes.\n\nHe made a mistake, and his girlfriend blew up at him, and then she told the whole internet about it.\n\nAlso, I've said in every one of my comments that he should have thrown away the food or frozen it before it went bad.", "To be honest the misandry here is the assumption that a man would need to be a mind reader or explicitly told in order to think of picking up groceries.

My fruit bowl often gets empty the day or two before I shop: again, it\u2019s reasonable for him to assume you would meal plan together once you were home. I usually throw out spoiled leftovers on trash day: I keep the stink down with refrigeration so I don\u2019t get knocked out every time I take trash out.

Coming home to no food after a vacation makes the next day more complicated as you try to clean up and go shopping. But I see his side too, and it\u2019s not unreasonable. Yes, you shouldn\u2019t have to ask for everything. But you also do have to communicate because different people have different methods. It\u2019s a balance, and it\u2019s not always easy to see. There are some things others do that are legitimately lazy. There are others things they do that just seem totally wrong but are still fine. I can\u2019t stand the way my husband folds laundry.

Why did he have to *make* dinner?\n\nWhy is it catastrophic that there is old food in the fridge, after only three days? Why did it spoil in three days? We're not proud of it, but in the grind of busy day-to-day life, my wife and I sometimes don't get to food before it's been in the fridge too long. I mean, its a standard running joke that folks have a container of mystery food in their fridge that is long forgotten.\n\nIf you are traditionally the \"initiator\" of meal planning in your daily lives, why did you assume he would automatically be planning meals for after when you get back?
