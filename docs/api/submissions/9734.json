Some background: I (38m) am from a European country. We have three levels of High school and college. They essentially come down to: Junior college, Community college and University. If you do well in community college and pass all your courses in your first year you can be admitted to University. \n\nWhich is what happened to me. I started in the second level of high school, worked my ass off during community college and then got into university. Now college is very cheap in my country, so I did two bachelors. Did both of them with honors and averaged at about an 8.0. Did two internships, a masters and got myself a great job. I now make about 150k a year, my wife (34f) makes about 100k. A few years ago we also inherited a large chunk of money (millions) after her mother passed. \n\nMy sister (36f) did Junior College, then got into community college but dropped out because she wanted to commit to her part-time job. She makes about 35k now, her husband (38m) about 30k. Now this is a great middle class income in my country. However, my sisters does not and has never thought in middle class terms. When she was 21 she sacrificed half her savings (about 10k) to buy a Chanel bag. They also had to postpone buying a house as my sister needed to go to New York, Miami and Los Angeles during her summer holiday a decade ago. Which cost them most of their savings. \n\nNow here\u2019s the issue, my wife and I live about an hour away from my hometown. Our eldest child is about to turn four and will have to start school. The schools in our region are \u201cmweh\u201d, the one in my hometown is pretty great. My mom is a teacher there too, so my child could see his grandmother a lot more too. Which both my wife and I think is important. We\u2019ve been looking for houses for a while, but until now haven\u2019t been able to find any in our price range. Recently a great property came on the market. It\u2019s an absolutely beautiful house, with a great yard for the kids. The family absolutely loves it, we already had a tour and have already discussed finances with the bank.\n\nWhen I went to show it to my parents and sister during our monthly family get together my sister went white as a sheet and bursted out \u201cyou can\u2019t buy that house\u201d. She told me that that had been her dream home forever, and that whenever we passed by she pointed to it and said \u201cI will live in that house one day\u201d (this is nearly two decades ago). I remembered, she was right, she did that. Here\u2019s the deal though, I would not buy it if she was seriously interested. She is not, it is a dream and that\u2019s it. A mere fantasy. The mortgage after a 10% down payment is about twice her husband and her salary combined before taxes. \n\nMy parents have chosen my sister\u2019s side, saying I can\u2019t possibly buy this house as it is her \u2018dream\u2019.

Someone is going to buy the house so she'll be upset anyway, and you shouldn't let your sister's fantasy control or limit where you can live. Get the house! And hopefully your parents will stop catering to your sister's delicate feelings so much.", "NTA, she didn't plan for it, it's never going to happen for her, at least this way she may be able to spend a holiday there", "NTA Buy the house. Sister doesn't own just because she called first dibs on it.", "NTA.", "NTA she cannot afford to buy it. Someone is going to buy it. That person could knock it down, build something else, or significantly change the facade. They could completely ruin it. At least you are 'keeping it in the family'. You could tell her you heard rumours that someone else was going to buy it and build apartments on it lol and so you were going to 'save it.' Better it goes to someone she knows than doesn't.", "NTA.   \nBuy it, and enjoy. If your sister has a problem, she can stay away.", "NTA. Your sister has the perfect dream home set up! She can visit often but doesn't have to pay the mortgage!", "NTA. Buy the house and promise you\u2019ll sell it to her as soon as she can afford it. This way you\u2019re holding it safe for her!", "Maybe it is her \"dream\" but it is your reality. That is no reason to stop you from buying it if it meets your needs. She will never be able to afford it. If she had continued her education, maybe she could have afforded it, but it was her choice to drop out of school. Even if she had been saving to be able to buy it someday, the house would probably have been sold to someone else by then. Tell your parents to butt out and quit favoring your sister. You have more right to the house, since you can actually afford it.", "NTA\n\n\"OK sis, I will be nice, I will give you a week to get financing and put in an offer, when you can't get financing I'm buying it.\"\n\nThat way you give her a chance, if she stays pissed then that is entirely on her.", "It's my dream to win the lotto one day. That doesn't mean  that no one else is going to win it until I do, does it? Buy the house.

My post reached the character limit, so I couldn't add this. She has not once been inside of that house. The most she's seen of it were the pictures posted on the real estate website. She and her family would be more than welcome to stop by whenever convienent. Granted this whole nonsensical feud will stop of course.", "Yeah I\u2019d have to agree. Especially because the sister can\u2019t afford the house", "Agreed.  OP, you shouldn't NOT by a house because someone else likes it. That's all this is.", "Plus he can really rub it her face that she will never own it", "I can find plenty of houses in that price range, just not in my hometown. It's a pretty middle class town, so most houses are tailored as such. There's a rarity of more up end houses, with the this one on the market being the exception at this moment.", "Judging by what happened the last few years, the drama unfortunately will always be there. My wife bought a Range Rover last year because she loved the car. Well, so did me sister. She was fuming for weeks because of it. My mom (who is a great woman, which makes this extra frustrating) somewhat enables this as she choices to validate my sister's outrage on these topics.", "In terms of salary she isn't doing bad, 35k is pretty decent in my country. The difference between staying and dropping out would be like 15-20k a year at this stage in her career. That wouldn't make her capable of buying the house in any way however. In terms of salary alone, my wife and I wouldn't even be able to afford it and we're doing extremely well.", "I think that would make it worse. Her envy would increase much more if she were able to spend time inside of the house. If you buy the house (and you should), you might have to give up the relationship with your sister.", "I assume your cutting contact after you buy it ?", "I think that is your answer\u2026 your sister might also be reacting to you living closer and \u201ctaking more\u201d of your Mom\u2019s time instead of just seeing her once a month. A difficult situation for sure. NTA", "I think you're NTA anyway, but if this is the case, I'd move forward with the house. Maybe sit down with just your mom and let her know your plan. At the same time, have a conversation with her about enabling your sister. She made her own choices and wasn't able to manage her finances responsibly. It's completely unreasonable that you'd have to lose out on doing what's best for your family because your sister will throw a tantrum. \n\nAs you've stated, it would be different if she were on the verge of being able to afford the home herself, but she's not. The way things are going, it may take another decade.", "Which means that she would never be able to afford it unless she inherited a lot of money or won a lottery. Even more reason that you should not be held back from buying the house.", "I'm honestly leaving that up to her. She is welcome (primarily due to her kids) to come over whenever her kids want to come over. Our relationship on its own is virtually non existent. My wife and I decided to have kids in our mid 30's, but would love to babysit her kids as she had them years before us. The kids were pretty much the only contact we had. It would suck to lose contact to my nieces, but that all depends on her behavior.", "Wish it was that simple. In terms of contact with her I would definitely cut it off. My nieces who my wife and I frequently watched before our kids make going no contact very hard however.", "The only one who would see my mom more would be my son as he would go to the school she works at. I'd still be fairly busy during the day, so seeing my family more isn't really plausible.", "NTA- Buy the house and live your best life. Your sister nor your parents get to dictate your life choices just because it makes her unhappy. If she really wanted that house she would have been socking away money to do so in the future, not taking trips or buying purses. Your sister has lofty dreams that she has no way of reaching without winning the lotto or improving her pay situation. As you have pointed out the drama will be there no matter what you do and maybe let your parents know that just because they validate your sisters ridiculous behavior you won't.", "NTA. Promise her and your mom that once your sister and her husband have saved enough to buy the house for the amount your going to pay for it now, you\u2019ll guarantee that you\u2019ll sell it to her. It\u2019s a win-win; your mom and sister will be happy, thinking they have someone to hold your sister\u2019s dream house so she can get it, and you know she\u2019ll NEVER have the money \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA but I will caution that this is gonna burn a bridge, permanently. Every time she comes over (if she does) will remind her again of the insult, and given the lack of emotional maturity she\u2019s shown through your descriptions I doubt she\u2019ll let you forget it", "NTA. Your sister made choices and they have consequences. Sorry she feels bad, but it sounds like a great home for your family.", "NTA. Buy and enjoy your new house.", "NTA. If you don\u2019t buy it, someone else will. Either way, she doesn\u2019t own the house.", "Also, if OP does buy the house, it\u2019s probably the closest she will ever get to being in it.", "Very true, but here's a thought that might help smooth things over, at least for the time being: why not bring up that someday, many years from now when you're ready to move out of the house, you can give her first rights to the house at the fair market value. This way she could have years (or decades) to start saving up for that possibility. Of course, if she continues with her spending ways, she'll never be near enough to put a down payment that will allow them to have a mortgage to afford that place, and you'll have to live with a whole new level of bickering, but at least it might keep the resentment at bay during the time you live there. Heck, it might even be enough to convince her to go back and finish her degree so she can find a job with greater income potential so she *can* save more money...", "Tell her she can buy it from you at market rate whenever she can afford it(never)", "Or two if she insists on cleaning out their savings to on expensive trips or buying expensive things. \n\nNTA"]}
