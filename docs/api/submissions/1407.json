During a rotation I noticed that one person in our group sometimes takes his phone out during a patient visit which I think is disrespectful to the patient and the doctor. It's not really through the entire duration of the visit and in short bursts, but it's still there and I noticed it and it's pretty irritating to see. I don't really know them but I thought I should bring it up to let them know how disrespectful it is.\n\nWhen we were done with our monthly rotation I approached this person, told them I wanted to talk to them, and then told them that they were a very disrespectful person. They seemed confused and somewhat upset over it so I told them that a doctor shouldn't be on their phone and it was offensive to both the patients and the doctors we see that he uses his phone during visits.\n\nHe then tried to defend himself by saying that he takes notes during class and looks stuff up related to the patient's symptoms or he has to discuss it later with our supervisor so that he doesn't forget and this is the best way he learns. He also mentioned he never looks at his phone when he is interacting with the patient or with the doctor and tries to do it when the patients are clearly busy or being examined by someone else so he's trying his best to fill in those times when he has nothing else to do.\n\nI told him nevertheless whatever he is using it for it he is being disrespectful. He asked me if any of the doctors or patients had mentioned anything (they didn't) but I told him that them not being offended doesn't necessarily mean he isn't disrespectful and this is just a general life thing he should keep in mind. He again tried to defend himself by saying he is not a doctor yet (and if he was, he would not be using his phone at all if he was the doctor there and only person interacting with the patient), he is a student and he is there to learn and this is his best way of learning. I told him that's not what it looks like to me and the supervisors and patients might misunderstand. I also told him that I also have questions in my mind or stuff I wanna look up but I don't out of respect, to which he just replied I should if that's what it takes for me to learn as much as possible.\n\nI don't think I am the asshole here but some friends told me that the way it was a very offensive way of confronting him by just walking up to tell him he's very disrespectful. I disagree because I think being direct in this case as a fellow student is better. A few friends also told me that it's not my business or place to tell him what to do or what not to do and as long as the supervisors know and don't mind him taking notes this way I should leave him alone but I don't think he understands how it looks and how some patients might take offense since they are in a vulnerable state and he keeps tapping on his phone no matter what he uses it for.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667608085, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymf6e8/aita_for_confronting_my_colleague_regarding_his/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Evidently none of them have objected. You know better than they do what's appropriate? YTA.", "Sorry, but YTA. He doesn't seem to be violating any facility rules or professional norms, and even if he was, it's not your to police his behavior. You should,d have said something to the professors and let them determine what if anything to do about it, as they are supposed to know what's proper. Perhaps he has a valid reason to do what he was doing, or maybe you're being too uptight. But in any event, it's not for you to impose your standards of behavior on others.", "YTA.
