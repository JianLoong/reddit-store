He had not been feeling the best in a few months and my bf (30M) and I brought him to the emergency vet where we found out he had an incurable cancer, a heart murmur and water in his abdomen. I took the decision to put him down and stayed with him the entire time. \n\nI cried all night Monday and went to work Tuesday. Tuesday night cried some more and went to work Wednesday. Wednesday night my bf decided to have a conversation with me telling me that he feels abandoned, how I'm very distant from him, how he feels alone in this relationship and how he's worried about the relationship and about me since I lost my cat. We've been together over a year and living together.\n\nI told him I just lost my cat and to give me time but I'm functioning and it's getting better day by day. He still said how he was doing things around the house to make me happy like the dishes and laundry and even downloaded movies I like to watch but that because I mostly stayed on my side of the bed when usually we cuddle that he felt alone and not needed. He said he misses my cat too but how he has to put his emotions aside for me to not put more pressure on me and it's bothering him.\n\nI actually got mad and asked why he is doing this right now? I said this isn't the time to be talking about this. He said he has no patience and can't hold his tongue and how it's never the right time cause it always has to be on my time and how it's affecting our relationship. I reminded him how he had ignored me for the entire month on the anniversary of his dad's passing and I never spoke to him like he's doing to me and it hasn't even been 48h so to just give me time.\n\nWell I stopped talking, he kept repeating himself and we went to bed. Now I feel like I'm an asshole for how I'm grieving my loss. He seems to think that me being in my bubble and in my head and not interacting with him like I usually do makes me the asshole.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\nEDIT: Other than last night, he had been very supportive, he would cuddle me, hug me, hold me, encouraged me to cry if needed because I would hold it all in, all the general stuff. Again I go to work everyday and come home afterwards, we eat diner and sometimes I have moments of crying. I had a conversation this morning with him. I told him how I felt like he was entitled to feel and act however he wants (regarding the 1 month of ignoring me) but how I wasn't allowed a few days to be quiet and sad. He apologized and said he didn't express himself properly and simply wants me to communicate with him and know that he is there for me.", "created_utc": 1681392248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kp3bi/aita_for_how_im_grieving_my_pet/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not even just an issue of your boyfriend trying to police how you grieve, or making this about himself- you two don\u2019t appear to share the same ideals about what is important. You just lost a family member, a best friend, and he thinks it\u2019s something that\u2019s so small that downloading a movie you like will make it better.

Let me give you some context for how insanely childish and self-centered his behavior is by explaining to you what a good partner looks like in this context. Last Easter, I almost had a similar weekend with my 13-year-old cat, who ended up with a bladder stone lodged in his urethra and needed emergency surgery on Easter Sunday. My (now) fianc\u00e9e didn't have a particular affinity for this cat, but she stayed with me all night at the emergency vet [literally from 11pm Friday night to like 6 am Sunday morning]. When I couldn't brain anymore and fell asleep on the floor, I woke up to her sitting outside the cat's little vet cage stroking his head. She'd been there for like an hour keeping him calm because she \"knew that it's what I would been doing for him but I needed to sleep.\" On like 3 hours of sleep, she got up and literally cooked Easter dinner for 6 people by herself with no help and didn't complain once because she knew I was spending the morning desperately trying to figure out where to get the surgery done and how to pay for it. She drove me back and forth when I could barely function. She held me while I wept in the waiting room. And not once in that 48-hour span did she make it about herself and how much of a burden this was for her. Why? Because she knew that I was wrecked and she loves me. And I STG it is exactly how I promise to love her and more when it [God forbid] is her turn to grieve and panic and be in chaos. Because I love her. And I'm her partner and that's how it works. \n\nYour BF has shown his true colors. He wants you to be there for him while he grieves for a month, but can't even pick up the emotional slack for 48 hours when it's your turn to grieve. That's not a partnership built on equal footing.

Boyfriend needs to get a grip, and a clue, in that order.  \n\n\nOP is NTA.", "Well, if it\u2019s HIS loss, at least a month.  Hers?  Yeah, not so much.", "Exactly-NTA-but her boyfriend is angling for a break up. He wants to break up so he\u2019s going to make her the bad guy.", "No don\u2019t worry, OP has no self respect and seemed really touched in her edit because he said he just wanted her to know he was there for her. Just another disappointing, less than bare minimum relationship that will continue making both of them unhappy in the long run", "Love this comment \ud83e\udd70", "I disagree simply because you shouldn't need to relate in order to respect that your partner needs some space. Even if NOTHING bad had happened to OP he shouldn't be complaining about her not cuddling him after 2 days like she's not fulfilling her girlfriend duties properly! (Obviously if nothing had happened and your partner suddenly stops paying you attention it's worth the conversation, but it still shouldn't be basically telling them off for not giving you the attention you want).", "Why tf would you expect OP to support her grown partner the way she would a child?\n\nAlso, as someone with ptsd who has experienced grief and loss, acute stages of grief feel so similar to trauma aftermath... probably because losing an important being from your life is traumatic. You can't help shutting dow with trauma and grief. People are also affected differently. She's crying for a few days and making it to work. The bf is being a complete ass and entirely selfish.", "Why tf would you expect OP to support her grown partner the way she would a child?\n\nAlso, as someone with ptsd who has experienced grief and loss, acute stages of grief feel so similar to trauma aftermath... probably because losing an important being from your life is traumatic.

I was having difficulties articulating in my mind exactly this.", "I why do you need to curse at me? Please be civil.  If she can support a child, then why can\u2019t she support a grown man? The emotions are the same. I\u2019m not saying she has to be fully functional and cooking meals and giving him blow jobs.  But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right that she is completely distant from him. She won\u2019t even cuddle with him.", "Not wanting to be touched while dealing with acute grief is not uncommon. Having your partner get mad at you for not prioritizing your wants for a few days when they aren't doing well is straight up disgusting behaviour.\n\nThe \"why tf\" was because your take was so shockingly bad and unempathetic to someone grieving.", "Again, would you treat a child like that? And I\u2019ve never heard of someone, not wanting a comforting hug from their significant other. Regardless, it doesn\u2019t justify you cursing at me."]}
