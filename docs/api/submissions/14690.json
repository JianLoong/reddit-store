He had not been feeling the best in a few months and my bf (30M) and I brought him to the emergency vet where we found out he had an incurable cancer, a heart murmur and water in his abdomen. I took the decision to put him down and stayed with him the entire time. \n\nI cried all night Monday and went to work Tuesday. Tuesday night cried some more and went to work Wednesday. Wednesday night my bf decided to have a conversation with me telling me that he feels abandoned, how I'm very distant from him, how he feels alone in this relationship and how he's worried about the relationship and about me since I lost my cat. We've been together over a year and living together.\n\nI told him I just lost my cat and to give me time but I'm functioning and it's getting better day by day. He still said how he was doing things around the house to make me happy like the dishes and laundry and even downloaded movies I like to watch but that because I mostly stayed on my side of the bed when usually we cuddle that he felt alone and not needed. He said he misses my cat too but how he has to put his emotions aside for me to not put more pressure on me and it's bothering him.\n\nI actually got mad and asked why he is doing this right now? I said this isn't the time to be talking about this. He said he has no patience and can't hold his tongue and how it's never the right time cause it always has to be on my time and how it's affecting our relationship. I reminded him how he had ignored me for the entire month on the anniversary of his dad's passing and I never spoke to him like he's doing to me and it hasn't even been 48h so to just give me time.\n\nWell I stopped talking, he kept repeating himself and we went to bed. Now I feel like I'm an asshole for how I'm grieving my loss. He seems to think that me being in my bubble and in my head and not interacting with him like I usually do makes me the asshole.\n\nAm I the asshole in this situation?\n\nINFO: Since people have asked, he has a dog and I have another younger cat. His dog had been hospitalized for 4 days and he was a mess, took a week off work, stayed in bed lights off doing nothing. I held him, I was there for him I consoled him and did everything in the house. This situation happened a second time but for 2 days. Again I was there. At the anniversary of his father's passing (9 years this yer) he ignored me completely, pushed me away when I would try and hug and console him and simply gamed day and night. I finally spoke to him about it after a month.\n\nEDIT: Other than last night, he had been very supportive, he would cuddle me, hug me, hold me, encouraged me to cry if needed because I would hold it all in, all the general stuff. I know he is sad about losing my cat and cried with me at the vet. Again I go to work everyday and come home afterwards, we eat diner and sometimes I have moments of crying. I had a conversation this morning with him. I told him how I felt like he was entitled to feel and act however he wants (regarding the 1 month of ignoring me) but how I wasn't allowed a few days to be quiet and sad. He apologized and said he didn't express himself properly and simply wants me to communicate with him and know that he is there for me.", "created_utc": 1681392248, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12kp3bi/aita_for_how_im_grieving_my_pet/", "score": 418, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he can\u2019t bring himself to be supportive for more than two days after you\u2019ve experienced any sort of loss/traumatic event, I think it\u2019s time you evaluate if this is someone worth keeping around.

Let me give you some context for how insanely childish and self-centered his behavior is by explaining to you what a good partner looks like in this context. Last Easter, I almost had a similar weekend with my 13-year-old cat, who ended up with a bladder stone lodged in his urethra and needed emergency surgery on Easter Sunday. My (now) fianc\u00e9e didn't have a particular affinity for this cat, but she stayed with me all night at the emergency vet [literally from 11pm Friday night to like 6 am Sunday morning]. When I couldn't brain anymore and fell asleep on the floor, I woke up to her sitting outside the cat's little vet cage stroking his head. She'd been there for like an hour keeping him calm because she \"knew that it's what I would been doing for him but I needed to sleep.\" On like 3 hours of sleep, she got up and literally cooked Easter dinner for 6 people by herself with no help and didn't complain once because she knew I was spending the morning desperately trying to figure out where to get the surgery done and how to pay for it. She drove me back and forth when I could barely function. She held me while I wept in the waiting room. And not once in that 48-hour span did she make it about herself and how much of a burden this was for her. Why? Because she knew that I was wrecked and she loves me. And I STG it is exactly how I promise to love her and more when it [God forbid] is her turn to grieve and panic and be in chaos. Because I love her. And I'm her partner and that's how it works. \n\nYour BF has shown his true colors. He wants you to be there for him while he grieves for a month, but can't even pick up the emotional slack for 48 hours when it's your turn to grieve. That's not a partnership built on equal footing.

I cried and cried and cried, for several days, if not weeks. My husband did nothing but support me the whole time. Took him to the vet with me, stayed with my while we put him down. Never said anything about how my grief affected him. Of course we were both grieving a little bit, he loved Lionel too, but it hit me way harder. Hell, I even took a day off work because I was a bit of a mess, and he supported that 100%. Even now, almost three years later, sometimes I get that feeling of grief. Of course it\u2019s not as extreme, but I do feel it. Even now whenever I say \u201cI miss my cat,\u201d my husband will hold me, say he knows, he misses him too. \n\nThe point of all this, is that it\u2019s not up to your partner to decide how you grieve, and whether or not you\u2019re grieving \u2018the right way,\u2019 or \u2018the wrong way.\u2019 Take it at your own pace, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this.

He's complaining that she stayed on her side of the bed and didn't cuddle him. Which, yes, if that was a persistent issue, would be worrying. But expecting her to keep up the same level of intimacy she regularly has while grieving is ridiculous. She needs time to recover, and if he can't handle her not cuddling him for two nights even though she's still spending time with him, then he needs help. \n\nIt's actually genuinely kind of worrying that he expects her to always be physically intimate (even non-sexually) to his standards with no allowances for her well-being. If she's dealing with bad period cramps for a few days and isn't feeling up to cuddling, will he get upset with her? If she's sick and doesn't want to cuddle, will he get upset?\n\nIf you can't handle the moments when your partner isn't feeling well and instead demand they always cater to *your* needs even if it's just for a couple of days, then you're not ready to be in a relationship. Ppl go through hardships and internal struggles all the time that make them slightly less than 100% available, and expecting otherwise is immature and self-centered.

Losing a beloved pet is hard. \n\nAlso, you don't have to answer, but something worth considering - is this causing you to give him less physical attention than he's used to? I ask this because I remember seeing a thread a while ago about men feeling entitled to sex from girflfriends or spouses even if they're literally in tears after a loss or a painful or traumatic situation.

Attack my argument on its merits. Calling it unreasonable is a cheap attempt to undermine the argument. Come with some facts, not blanket statements. \n\nThe point (which you obviously missed) about celebrating with drinks is that there is a limit to the type of variation in terms of how people grieve.  Your response suggests that you agree.  As such, it\u2019s reasonable, to have certain expectations with someone\u2019s behavior, regardless of what they\u2019re going through. Expecting that person to seek out their significant other for comfort is within what I would consider reasonable behavior. Completely shutting them out, is not. \n\nA default setting doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to react the exact same way. But I do think there are certain behaviors that are common and to be expected. For instance, everyone grieves the loss of a loved one with sadness. No one reacts with joy.

I highly encourage you to look up what experts say about it, [read some articles](https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/coping-with-ambiguous-grief) about how they encourage partners to [support their grieving loved ones](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/bereavement/for-friends-and-family/) by understanding that they don't have the fortitude to be 100% invested in the relationship and support them until they are. It may help you realize that [how OP is dealing with grief is a common experience](https://www.taps.org/articles/24-1/settingboundarieswhilegrieving) and nothing to look at strangely. \n\n>The point (which you obviously missed) about celebrating with drinks is that there is a limit to the type of variation in terms of how people grieve.

As such, it\u2019s reasonable, to have certain expectations with someone\u2019s behavior, regardless of what they\u2019re going through.\n\nYes, of course there are limits. But not cuddling your partner for a couple of days, especially if you are otherwise engaged in the relationship (ie talking to them, spending time with them, etc.) are generally not considered as reaching those limits. I doubt you'd find many other ppl who would think that's unreasonable and/or disrespectful behavior from someone grieving. \n\n>Expecting that person to seek out their significant other for comfort is within what I would consider reasonable behavior. Completely shutting them out, is not. \n\nWhere do you see OP completely shutting him out if they're watching movies together, having dinner together, and presumably still talking at home? A slight distancing from *one* aspect of the relationship is not a complete shut out. For the bf to say he thinks she's *abandoning* him bc she didn't feel up to cuddles for the past to days is an overexxageration of her behavior. If he expected her to seek physical comfort, he could have just asked her why she hadn't been looking to him for that kimd of support and listened to her answer instead of accusing her of not being invested in the relationship anymore. \n\n>But I do think there are certain behaviors that are common and to be expected.\n\nBased on what knowledge? Where does this belief come from? Your own personal experience? Psychological reports? You're talking about an aspect of human behavior that has been researched, studied, and evaluated-there is an answer readily available to anyone interested on whether grief impacts physical intimacy or not, and how it does so. So are you getting your opinion from psychological experts or from an unreliable source?\n\nEdit: as an example, if I said I thought it was reasonable that most ppl wanted kids, would you not have questions as to *why* I thought so? What was I basing it on? What reason would I have to think that? What makes me qualified to say that? Did I do any research to see statistics of how many ppl do and don't want kids?"]}
