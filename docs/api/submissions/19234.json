You noted trespassers on your property - creating a legal liability to you.  You noted trespassers had caused damage to your property.  You repeatedly acted reasonably to attempt to contact persons nearby to discern ownership, etc.  You did not choose to tow the truck with a tractor or otherwise impound it.  You therefore reasonably contacted law enforcement, rather than engage in some conduct putting persons at risk of physical harm.  The police suggested having the vehicle towed.  And yet, you again tried to be overly kind and did not do so.  You acted so kindly.  The fact that the trespassers, who may or may not be the ones damaging your property, had warrant outstanding it not your fault.  Its actually quite good you took these actions so the pregnant trespasser could go to hospital and so you would not have liability for some injury sustained on your property by the trespasser.  \n\nFor the future, post \"No trespassing\" signs.

The liability is one of the reasons I agreed with contacting non-emergency after speaking with my parents.\n\n I actually do have multiple no trespassing/beware of dog/property under video surveillance signs posted. However, they're on approach to the residence from the road. They entered from a small access path that led to my neighbor's property down by the lake. I didn't want to fence it off because our neighbor does occasionally use it to go fishing early in the morning on weekends. He's usually packing up around 10 am. and has been doing such since we've owned the property (approx. 2 years). He backs up a small SUV to his jonboat to load for fishing. He doesn't ride circles around the fire pit or rut the shoreline up launching a canoe with a half-ton truck. I've spoken to him, he waves when I see him from my porch, and my other neighbor knows him and has only good things to say about him.\n\nI simply wanted to speak to this new person I'd never seen and ask them not to tear up the grass, if it was them that's been doing it, and to let us know when they were going out fishing and who all they'd be taking.
