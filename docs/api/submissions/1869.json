Wow that\u2019s so inappropriate, but the thing is it\u2019ll really be very difficult for you to convince her. So I suggest you grab your sibling (I hope you have one) and let them sleep on your bed with you guys so your partner can feel how awkward it is.", "NTA you feel uncomfortable about it and your partner should respect that and not push it.", "NTA. That's odd. Sister can sleep in a different bed.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m not a twin but knowing quite a few including a couple of identical twins I\u2019m pretty sure none of them share beds once they became teenagers/ adults\n\nYour partner reminds me of those twins in Perth who share the same partner and claim they have to get pregnant and give birth at exactly the same time\n\nIf the attachment is that strong I think they need to see a therapist as that\u2019s not normal!", "NTA your bed is your personal space and itvis also a place for intimacy ask your girlfriend if she is ok to make out when her sister is right besides her. And with all due respect what if you make a mistake in sleep like maybe your gf is gone to drink water and you mistake her sister as your gf and hug her it could be that could be horrifying for your relationship and traumatic experience for you. You should sit down with her and have a talk", "Hello, what????", "NTA, this sounds weird. \n\nI'm not a twin either so I guess I can't grasp what it is like to be one, but respecting the privacy/boundaries of others (especially your partner, especially in the bedroom!) should still be non-debatable. I imagine three adults in a double bed gets quite tight anyway. Personally I haven't heard of \"it is my bed as well, so I can decide who else gets to sleep in it (while we are there)\" - normally, you would just let guests sleep in a... well... guest room or at least provide them with an air mattress. \n\nIf your partner and her twin want to sleep in one bed together, maybe they should be getting a double air mattress and leave you alone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It could be a trauma bond thing where both don't feel safe until they're with the other. When me and my sister were little, my sister was scared of the dark and wouldn't be able to sleep until I climbed into her bed and slept next to her. We eventually grew out of it by ths time we were 8. Sometimes when I visit her, she let's me take a nap on her bed or will offer her bed so I'm more comfortable.", "NTA - explain that whilst they are close it makes you uncomfortable and you would not sleep well. Her or you when she visits but not both?", "NTA.\n\nI have a twin and we do not sleep in the same bed with a partner.\n\nWe can sleep in one bed no problem but if my or his gf is in it is not even a thing we just go crash on the couch or whatever.\n\nSo yeah this is indeed a bit too much to ask.", "NAH \n\nmaybe they want to \"share\" you", "Sounds like Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\n\nTell the twin to sleep in her own pod.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  The bed is shared.   Therefore, the decision about who sleeps there is mutual.  Neither has the freedom to overrule the other.   Partner ITA.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your bed. Yours and your partners. It\u2019s simply not appropriate for the twin to sleep in your bed with you! If it makes you uncomfortable, then no, it shouldn\u2019t be happening.", "NTA\n\nLike your partner said, it's your bed (both), that means that both of you needs to be comfortable with any decision about it.\n\nWhy can't they sleep in a guest bed or, if you don't have that, in sleeping bags? Why do you have to be uncomfortable in your own bed?\n\nPersonally, I would not sleep in the same bed as my siblings being an adult, but I'm not judging those who does. But, it is pretty strange to sleep with your sibling in the bed you share with your partner while your partner is there too (not for sexual reason, it,s just the bed is the most private furniture in your house, so it's normal to be more strict about who can be in it).", "Not the asshole. \n\nThats really odd, im glad its not sexual but them wanting to sleep together is STILL REALLY WEIRD. its not breakup worthy but thats on hell of a red flag.", "NTA. She can have the twin sleep in the bed if she wants. But she can't make you sleep there. That's very intimate, you're right. And sleeping is such a personal thing. She's not your sister. You don't have that intimacy with her. I advise you tell your partner that she can do what she wants but you're not comfortable sleeping there.", "NTA, the bed is an intimate shared place for you and your partner only. For your partner to say the bed is also her sisters is absolutely insane. Twin thing or no, this is beyond the pale.", "NTA\n\nThis is bonkers. No, it's not unreasonable for you not to want to share a bed with your partner's twin and no, your bed **certainly** isn't her twin's bed too. The hell?\n\nIf they really want to share a sleeping space, they can find a different bed and leave you to sleep in **your** bed in privacy.", "NTA. As you said, a bed is your intimate space with your partner. This is a definite case of one \u201cno\u201d being the final answer.", "NTA. A shared bed is always a 2 yes, 1 no situation\u2014no guests allowed for any purpose unless both people want the guest there. If your partner and her sister want to share a bed when sister visits, they can use a guest room or an air mattress on the living room floor.", "NTA - this is a perfectly normal boundary. From your comments it seems like the twins are so used to having no boundaries with each other they expect you to be comfortable with that arrangement too without realising they\u2019re asking you to compromise your own boundaries. Your partner needs to set boundaries with her twin, yesterday.", "NTA but I want some INFO. When she does come over is there a twin bed for her?", "NTA\n\nHer and her twin can take the couch or guest bed. You don\u2019t invite other people into you \u201cmarital\u201d bed even if it\u2019s platonic if the other person says no. \n\nAlso can honestly say I\u2019ve never felt the need to have my siblings share a bed with husband and I and were close AF", "This can\u2019t be real, surely?!", "NTA. One thing if she wants to share bed with her sister. But she also wants to force you to share bed with her sister. She might be the only twin of you two, but this is not about being a twin. This is about having someone sharing your bed against your will.", "Honestly if my partner's sister wasn't straight I would be worried - she's always all over me and tries to sit on my lap and stuff. I'm not a very cuddly person, I only ever hug my partner so it really weirds me out when her sister tries to get me to cuddle her and stuff. I think some of it comes from a nice place, I think they sort of want me to be like their third twin? (And this is emphasised by me being female, so my partner's sister wants me to be a part of their twin bond). But of course I'm not, and I don't want to be. I respect their relationship but being that close to somebody else (other than a partner) would drive me insane!", "100% think it's a trauma thing. They've both been through some stuff and as a result I think they crave the comfort of being in their safe zone with the other. But I guess I just don't know how to address it without coming across like the asshole. It's become a longstanding argument that never seems to get solved.", "Very different situation as your sister\u2019s partner is presumably not also in the bed where you\u2019re taking a nap. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019d never want to sleep in someone\u2019s marital bed whether or not their partner was there.", "But do you finish", "That's the thing, we have the option of an airbed or the sofa so it's not as if there's nowhere else to sleep. But they both think that I'm being harsh, I just don't know, it's really odd in my opinion.", "There's an airbed or the sofa which are both comfy enough for temporary use, it's not because there's nowhere else to sleep and her twin doesn't complain about not being comfortable or anything like that. It's solely a comfort thing, wanting to be in their safe zone with each other. So I've suggested me sleeping elsewhere while they share the bed but they're always weird about that.", "I know several twins and that is not normal", "Mate this isn\u2019t normal", "That's a very hard call and I'm so sorry she had to go through that with her sister. I think the best you can do is to say,  I understand you've both been together since you were born but it's okay to not share everything too. It's also okay to have spaces designed for just yourself and to not share it.", "I think you need to reframe the issue. You're fine with them sharing a bed ... if it doesn't involve you.\n\nYour partner should sleep in the guest bed with the sister. That's the reasonable compromise.\n\nHow often does her sister spend the night?", "Also true too. I believe that both sisters honestly never had much of a chance to develop their separate identities. My sister and I actively fought to be recognized as two separate people since we didn't want to be treated as if we were the same person. For OP's girlfriend, she needs to learn how to separate herself fron her sister. Being an identical twin is part of your identity but not your WHOLE identity.", "Bruh xd", "Is the air bed twin sized?\n\n(I\u2019m just being ridiculous because of how silly this is for you. )"]}
