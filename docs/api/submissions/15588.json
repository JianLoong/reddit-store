Meanwhile I'm the sole breadwinner of the family. My wife has a friend, also a stay at home mum, who recently got into selling some dietary supplements and is trying to convince my wife to do the same. She claims she makes good money on it. Now my wife is asking me for a $500 initial investment. This whole thing seems like an obvious MLM to me so I said no and that it's a waste of money. Now my wife is mad that I'm trying to stop her from having her own source of income, which is not true, I wouldn't mind her having a part time job, just this particular idea seems sketchy to me. I really don't want to be a controlling husband, I just think this is going to be a waste of our money and her energy. Am I in the wrong here?\n\nUpdate: My wife has done some reading on the company and agreed that this wasn't a good idea. She told me the conversation with her friend made her realize she wants to come back to work. She felt hurt after coming to me excited about it, just for me to say it was bullshit. I understand, I should have communicated it better. I was too harsh. This is what made me TA, not that I was against investing in the MLM.

It does not sound like you are trying to control your wife financially, because you are more than plus with her finding a part time job. Oftentimes MLM\u2019s suck in SAHM\u2019s with the lure of being able to make their own hours and work only a couple of hours a week. While she will have to work more than two hours a week (that claim isn\u2019t really true), she can do it with the kids around. So if you want to be supportive  of her having her own source of income, which will likely require her to work outside of the home, you will need to be flexible and make some consessions. You all have to expect she might need to work some evenings and weekends and accept less time with her and more time with the kids and accepts that maybe the house isn\u2019t as clean or whatnot. I\u2019m not saying, you WONT do these things, just that maybe your wife is thinking this way she can contribute without things have to change much for you and kids and she my feel bad if it does. So if you assure her you support her in a part time job outside the house, she might not be so attracted to MLM\u2019s. And seriously there are so many MLM\u2019s now it\u2019s ridiculous. And the only way you can make any real money is if you get people underneath you to sell and then you get a percentage of what they sell. I did MLM for a bit and the most I ever made after expenses was 400 for the a month. That was ONE time in a year otherwise, I maybe pulled in a couple hundred and it was more time than it was worth as I also had another full time job.", "NTA but she should have access to money that you don\u2019t oversee.

If it was a startup cost to start her own, independent business based on a skill or hobby she had that would be one thing- but these sorts of selling and marketing schemes are costly to get into, difficult to make a profit off of, and can very easily land someone in a rabbit hole of constant fees, purchases, and debt. I strongly recommend doing some online research into the company your wife's friend is invested in, chances are if they are an MLM they'll have countless reviews and websites calling them out as a scam. Find those and show them to your wife. Explain why you're uncomfortable with this and maybe suggest your idea of a part-time job, or starting up her own thing.", "NTA mlms are scams.

That's not just \"most\" . . . it's literally all but the top 1%, which means that it's likely a whopping lie that her friend is turning a profit either. \n\nI would also show her some of the articles and documentaries about all of the MLMs that have been sued, lost, literally been proven to be scamming to people, gotten warning after warning from the government, and yet continue to do business and prey on the unsuspecting.\n\nOn top of which, many of the \"health\"-related MLMs (and I use the word \"health\" reluctantly), from the essential oil companies to the ones selling \"nutritional supplements\" like your wife is looking at, have the additional foulness of often making questionable claims and sometimes being downright unsafe (either overall or based on the claims and suggestions that they make, which are neither scientific nor medically accurate). It would be bad enough if your wife were looking to sell cheap leggings, but messing with people's health and selling \"nutritional\" products with questionable claims isn't just poor business, it's potentially harmful to customers as well. \n\nYou are for sure NTA. Tell her that you would support her starting a LEGITIMATE small business, or getting a part-time job, but that you cannot in good conscience support her preying on people, or participating in a de facto pyramid scheme.", "NTA\n\nObviously MLMs are a bad idea, but you should approach this gently.\n\nSaying \"that sounds like a waste of money\" can come across as dismissive, even if it's true. It would help if you explained why it's a waste of money, by giving examples of what other MLMs are like.\n\nMLMs are usually targeted towards women who stay at home, they use fabricated or cherry-picked statistics to manipulate people into \"partnering with them\" (read; working without being paid) and the only actual way to make money in them is by convincing a whole bunch of other people to make the same mistake you did.", "NTA Yes, it's an MLM, and, yes, it's a scam.", "NTA.

These sales businesses pretty much are all MLMs. It\u2019s a ponzi and should stay away. \n\nBut maybe this is a sign that your wife wants to do something for herself.

If you only clear $500/week - I'm not sure I give a week of income for a bad decision.\n\nIf you two have your own \"allowances\", then its her decision to make with her side of the money.

With good intentions obviously, but still. MLMs are VERY attractive to SAHMs because of that promise of quick easy money that is flexible hours of work and can fit around a child's schedule. That's the hook! \n\nCan you possibly persuade your wife to do more research? Can you ask her to watch some of the documentaries about MLMs (I've seen a few on Netflix)? Ask her - once she's tapped out friends and family, who, where and how does she plan to get new clients? \n\nNTA OP, just hope you can frame your refusal in a way that doesn't upset your wife too much.", "NAH. You're Not ta for not wanting to invest in a pyramid scheme, of course. But she's not ta for wanting to have access to money.\n\nBut I'm concerned about the framing of the question and its implications for the way you share finances with your spouse, particularly the \"controlling husband\" bit. If you were going to spend $500 on a Bitcoin purchase, would you feel the need to tell your wife beforehand? If no, you are already a controlling husband.", "Yeah you're kind of TA.\n\nA marriage is a partnership, so you guys need to decide together. Ultimately who cares if it's a bad opportunity? It's a *life* opportunity, and she will enjoy it and learn something from it.\n\nIf it helps you get past the idea that it's a dumb business, think of it as a hobby. If your wife wanted to put $500 into a hobby would you be agreeable to it? I say be supportive and encouraging, let her give it a shot and see what happens and be her biggest fan in this and all things in life.", "Even if it is mlm why don't you let her find out herself?

Also, she can watch this John Oliver on MLMs. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/s6MwGeOm8iI", "nta. she finally figured it out but does she have any hobbies or like crafting and things like that? she could do them for fun and then probably post them and sell them. that is if she doesn't want to work a retail/office job. that's personally what I'd do if I was a sahm \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "And definitely don't want to lose money on scams either!", "Hell, she\u2019d get more out of volunteer work than she would out of an MLM.", "Amen. This is the comment I was looking for. I am 100% against MLMs but I\u2019m more against husbands controlling the finances so women have to ask daddy if they want to make a purchase. Yeah, an MLM is a bad investment but I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s made a bad investment in his life and his wife didn\u2019t get to override him in it because he made the money. SAHMs work too, and she gets no monetary compensation for her labor. I\u2019d rather see her fail at an MLM than have him take her adult decision making abilities away.", "And it would be A BUSINESS, not hocking supplements that you have no stake in.", "Being realistic is realizing that 99% of people in MLMs lose money, and those who don't get it by taking advantage of others.", "Wow I knew they were bad, but that\u2019s just shameful.", "People in healthy relationships don't spend 500 dollars of their mutual funds without having a conversation with their partner."]}
