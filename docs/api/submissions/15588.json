If she's interested in making her own money, maybe to talk to her about other opportunities, like a part-time job. If she's dead set on this, I would recommend that you ask her to promise you that this $500 will be the only investment you'll have to make.

She needs to find a source of income that does not require selling useless crap to family and friends. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.

My MIL and FIL did that for a while. Dietary supplements. \n\nit was \"herbal life\"", "NTA. It does not sound like you are trying to control your wife financially, because you are more than plus with her finding a part time job. Oftentimes MLM\u2019s suck in SAHM\u2019s with the lure of being able to make their own hours and work only a couple of hours a week. While she will have to work more than two hours a week (that claim isn\u2019t really true), she can do it with the kids around. So if you want to be supportive  of her having her own source of income, which will likely require her to work outside of the home, you will need to be flexible and make some consessions. You all have to expect she might need to work some evenings and weekends and accept less time with her and more time with the kids and accepts that maybe the house isn\u2019t as clean or whatnot. I\u2019m not saying, you WONT do these things, just that maybe your wife is thinking this way she can contribute without things have to change much for you and kids and she my feel bad if it does. So if you assure her you support her in a part time job outside the house, she might not be so attracted to MLM\u2019s. And seriously there are so many MLM\u2019s now it\u2019s ridiculous. And the only way you can make any real money is if you get people underneath you to sell and then you get a percentage of what they sell. I did MLM for a bit and the most I ever made after expenses was 400 for the a month. That was ONE time in a year otherwise, I maybe pulled in a couple hundred and it was more time than it was worth as I also had another full time job.", "NTA but she should have access to money that you don\u2019t oversee.  You should budget for necessities and then each have some personal spending or fun money (if possible). She should be able to save up to do this if she chooses.  It may be a dumb choice but if it comes out of her personal fun money let her make her own mistakes", "NTA, its a scam from the beginning and she can do a part time job to raise the initial capital like everyone else and see if she still wants to invest. Suddenly she would feel a lot different. Most of these MLM scams only involve the founders from getting rich on those who is not smart enough to join.", "A legitimate business can provide P&L statements signed by a CPA. Her friend won't. Because she is not being honest.", "NTA. You\u2019re right-it\u2019s an MLM and she should run for the hills.", "Read MLM, hard pass! NTA", "NTA - MLMs are so predatory. \n\nThey are required to post income disclosure statements on their websites. I would pull the table and show it to your wife. If it\u2019s so lucrative, her friend should be willing to show her stubs as well. \n\nStick to your guns on this.", "NTA\n\nScam scam scam", "NTA\n\nAnd I say this as a SAHM who did the Juice Plus supplements, Younique make up and PartyLite candles. \n\nIt takes over your life and you end up fabricating this false hyped-up version of yourself to convince your friends and family to part with their money.", "NTA. That's not in any way an investment.

I have never, ever seen any of these direct-sell, MLM bullshit \"businesses\" turn anything resembling a worthwhile profit.  It's not a \"source of income\", it's an expensive hobby.", "It's  a pyramid  scheme.  Don't  help.", "NTA- it 100% sounds like an MLM and those companies are not to be trusted. If it was a startup cost to start her own, independent business based on a skill or hobby she had that would be one thing- but these sorts of selling and marketing schemes are costly to get into, difficult to make a profit off of, and can very easily land someone in a rabbit hole of constant fees, purchases, and debt. I strongly recommend doing some online research into the company your wife's friend is invested in, chances are if they are an MLM they'll have countless reviews and websites calling them out as a scam. Find those and show them to your wife. Explain why you're uncomfortable with this and maybe suggest your idea of a part-time job, or starting up her own thing.", "NTA mlms are scams. Ask her friend to see the  checks for this \u201cgood money\u201d she is making. Her friend is trying to recruit her because that\u2019s one of the ways they make money, the \u201cfriend\u201d will get a cut of the $500 initial investment.", "NTA ask the friend to provide info on earnings as well as time spent on the business. Encourage her to find another way to earn money ETSY is a great place for SAHM to be creative and make money. Pyramid schemes are never the way to go", "Of course you're NTA\n\nI would suggest that you send her some articles and stats on the reality of MLMs outside of the propaganda her \"friend\" (who has an obvious bias since she's literally trying to recruit your wife to her downline and make money off her) is sharing with her.\n\nI'd start with the FTC's study that showed that **99% of recruited sellers lose money in MLMs**. That's not just \"most\" . . . it's literally all but the top 1%, which means that it's likely a whopping lie that her friend is turning a profit either. \n\nI would also show her some of the articles and documentaries about all of the MLMs that have been sued, lost, literally been proven to be scamming to people, gotten warning after warning from the government, and yet continue to do business and prey on the unsuspecting.\n\nOn top of which, many of the \"health\"-related MLMs (and I use the word \"health\" reluctantly), from the essential oil companies to the ones selling \"nutritional supplements\" like your wife is looking at, have the additional foulness of often making questionable claims and sometimes being downright unsafe (either overall or based on the claims and suggestions that they make, which are neither scientific nor medically accurate). It would be bad enough if your wife were looking to sell cheap leggings, but messing with people's health and selling \"nutritional\" products with questionable claims isn't just poor business, it's potentially harmful to customers as well. \n\nYou are for sure NTA. Tell her that you would support her starting a LEGITIMATE small business, or getting a part-time job, but that you cannot in good conscience support her preying on people, or participating in a de facto pyramid scheme.", "NTA\n\nObviously MLMs are a bad idea, but you should approach this gently.\n\nSaying \"that sounds like a waste of money\" can come across as dismissive, even if it's true. It would help if you explained why it's a waste of money, by giving examples of what other MLMs are like.\n\nMLMs are usually targeted towards women who stay at home, they use fabricated or cherry-picked statistics to manipulate people into \"partnering with them\" (read; working without being paid) and the only actual way to make money in them is by convincing a whole bunch of other people to make the same mistake you did.", "NTA Yes, it's an MLM, and, yes, it's a scam.", "NTA. Selling supplements will not make her a boss babe and business owner. MLMs do not empower anyone but the first few.", "NTA just show her the Herbalife documentary on Netflix", "NTA. These sales businesses pretty much are all MLMs. It\u2019s a ponzi and should stay away. \n\nBut maybe this is a sign that your wife wants to do something for herself. Maybe turn it around to talk about passions and interests she has that she could turn into a business. \n\nMaking things to sell on sites like Etsy, or buying/selling collectibles from car boot sales or flea markets, or taking a course to then do therapy or coaching online. \n\nThere are lots of things out there that might suit your family and give her something \u201cfor her\u201d.", "NTA however you probably will need to research anti-MLM tactics. Her friend knows exactly what to say to make you seem like you're being controlling, tactics which her friend gets from the scheme to help her recruit people.", "NTA. there's loads of research out there on MLMs. Might wanna sit her down and go over the hard facts, mainly the fact that the majority of people who join an MLM actually lose money.", "People out there still acting brand new and falling for MLMs despite so much information out there on them.\n\nNTA", "Have her get a part time job. Make sure the job paychecks pays the household back for things like gasoline, uniforms, etc. Other than that, let her save the money. When she has saved $500, see if she wants to invest HER $500 into the MLM.", "NTA. Do not let her join a cult. Show her the lularich documentary on Netflix, or the income statesments some MLM's publish.", "The sub reddit antiMLM can help you talk to her", "Your wife sounds like she wants to build tombs for Pharaohs. NTA  Foot pics are easier to sell and more profitable. JS", "NTA\n\nThis is a tough one.  Ultimately, this is MLM of course.  \n\nINFO: How do you split the money up and how much is $500 to your family \"in the grand scheme of things\".  If giving my wife $500 stopped a fight, I would let her blow it and learn a hard lesson.  If you only clear $500/week - I'm not sure I give a week of income for a bad decision.\n\nIf you two have your own \"allowances\", then its her decision to make with her side of the money.  But, if it requires a mutual sacrifice, it needs to be a mutual decision.  \n\nIn short: if you decided to go to the casino to spend $500, would you feel entitled to do it without \"permission\"?  If so, consider this her casino money.  Just because you're the \"breadwinner\" shouldn't entitle you to all financial decisions.", "Well, I think you are kinda being a controlling husband tbh. With good intentions obviously, but still. MLMs are VERY attractive to SAHMs because of that promise of quick easy money that is flexible hours of work and can fit around a child's schedule. That's the hook! \n\nCan you possibly persuade your wife to do more research? Can you ask her to watch some of the documentaries about MLMs (I've seen a few on Netflix)? Ask her - once she's tapped out friends and family, who, where and how does she plan to get new clients? \n\nNTA OP, just hope you can frame your refusal in a way that doesn't upset your wife too much.", "NAH. You're Not ta for not wanting to invest in a pyramid scheme, of course. But she's not ta for wanting to have access to money.\n\nBut I'm concerned about the framing of the question and its implications for the way you share finances with your spouse, particularly the \"controlling husband\" bit. If you were going to spend $500 on a Bitcoin purchase, would you feel the need to tell your wife beforehand? If no, you are already a controlling husband.", "Yeah you're kind of TA.\n\nA marriage is a partnership, so you guys need to decide together. Ultimately who cares if it's a bad opportunity? It's a *life* opportunity, and she will enjoy it and learn something from it.\n\nIf it helps you get past the idea that it's a dumb business, think of it as a hobby. If your wife wanted to put $500 into a hobby would you be agreeable to it? I say be supportive and encouraging, let her give it a shot and see what happens and be her biggest fan in this and all things in life.", "Even if it is mlm why don't you let her find out herself? Or offer alternatives. I don't think it's right for you making decisions for your wife.
