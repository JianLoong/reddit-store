My husband is a corporate executive and the main breadwinner in our family.  I work part-time (about 25-30hrs/week) during the school year, but during the summer I am a SAHM for our kids to cut down on childcare costs.  \n\nLast week my mom called to let me know that my grandparents (both in their 90s) had been in a car accident and that while both were still alive, they were both in rough shape.  She told me that if I wanted to see and talk to them again, it would probably be best that I get there as soon as possible just in case.  \n\nI immediately told my husband what happened and started looking at flights.  I found a redeye for that night and started packing.  While I was stuffing clothes into a bag, my husband asked me what we were going to do with the kids.  I told him that he's going to have to figure it out because I'm obviously not taking them with me.  \n\nHe started to talk about work commitments he has and kept asking questions about how long I'll be gone and if I had any suggestions about someone to help with the kids.  I snapped at him that he's going to have to figure that out on his own and that I don't know how long I will be gone, but I'll try to let him know as soon as I can.  \n\nI've been with my parents and grandparents for 6 days now, my grandpa is recovering, but my grandma has been in and out of consciousness and will still require more surgery.

But until I know my grandma is going to be ok, I don't want to leave.  \n\nLast night after video chatting with my kids, my husband said he needed to talk to me.  He told me that no one has been able to help with the kids and he needs an answer for when I'm coming home so that he can at least give his job a timeframe.  He said he understands why I want to stay, but the open-ended thing isn't working for him and his job and I need to respect the fact that his job is our only income right now and if he needs to take an extended leave, I need to let him know ASAP.   \n\nI told him he needs to respect the fact that my grandmother could die at any moment and until I know she's going to be ok, I'm not leaving.  I told him there are more important things in life than work and if his job doesn't understand that, then maybe it's not the right place for him.  \n\nHe told me that he's tried to be as sympathetic and understanding as possible, but it's been almost a week and he's mad at me for leaving without trying to help make any arrangements for the kids and for not giving him any timeline at all for my return.  He told me he's sorry about my grandparents, but that doesn't mean I get to neglect my commitments at home.

Sorry, he is correct. While yes, she is in the hospital and that is scary but you are jeopardizing his career and the financial situation of your family.", "YTA\n\nYes, they are his kids and he needs to parent them. That being said, you just took his childcare option away due to an emergency and he IS doing the best he can. He IS parenting. He IS taking the time he needs to watch the kids. He was unable to find temporary care while you are away, and he is still willing to miss work as long as he has a timeline to tell them. That's reasonable to ask for. This is the income that keeps your home afloat. You need this to survive. He can't miss work forever. \n\nIf you do not go back for a while, maybe you could help look around for a temporary day home option in the area? Or maybe he can? It'll be a lot of money at once for 3 kids, but its better than losing an executive level income because he can't give a time of when he will be back. \n\nHe is trying to be responsible on all sides while you are away.", "Yta. Leaving right away and telling him to figure out the kids was definitely totally reasonable. But the rest is a bit much. Giving a time frame and/or helping come up with alternative childcare seems reasonable if you've already been gone a whole week", "Title is misleading. You didn't just \"not making childcare arrangements before leaving for a family emergency\". You also didn't make childcare arrangements After leaving, and also won't give a timeframe. I was all ready to attack the husband for not caring for his own kids, but it seems he care about them, but still isn't able to magically produce childcare. Saying to someone to just quit their job is never a soultuion, and it's point it's your responsibility as much as his to find a solution to this problem. YTA", "YTA\n\nUnless you're got another revenue stream to pay your bills telling your husband's work \"maybe this isn't the right place for him\" is not going to cut it. His work is not going to put up with this forever. You need to communicate with your husband and come up with a plan for him to keep his job, and have someone watch your children, and do it remotely. You left abruptly (and indefinitely) and left someone with two jobs to do and no plan to get them done.", "YTA. I understand this is a stressful emergency situation for you, but part of having kids means you don't just have the luxury of \"taking off\" without making some type of arrangements for them.\n\nNow, your husband absolutely has a responsibility to be active in that process too and can't just expect you to make all the arrangements before you leave, but it's not unreasonable to want to make those arrangements *together* with you, especially if there are actual hurdles that can't be easily surmounted.  It's also not unreasonable that he needs to at least know what your plan is, because that's going to have an impact on what he can arrange. From what you're posting, he's not saying he won't pick up the slack, he just needs to *know* so that he can properly arrange what he needs to\"\n\nThere may be more important things in life than work, but work is ultimately what pays the bills. Saying \"it may not be the best job for you\" is a pretty glib and unrealistic solution. \n\nFrankly, the very fact that you were in a position where you *could* take off at a moment's notice and intend to stay there indefinitely is a marker of the lifestyle your husband's job is apparently affording you all and he's not wrong to have concerns about that.", "Although youre emotional atm and have a event going on.\n\nYoure mostly just sitting there right? Cant you talk to him? At the very least ask him what about his parents?  Or tell him what you normally do for childcare help?", "YTA. I think your kids care should come before your grandparents. Like yes, you should see them, but you\u2019re forcing your husband to become a single parent when it\u2019s not necessary. You said you work part time and I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not working while you\u2019re visiting. You could use your time there to arrange childcare. You\u2019ve been there for 6 days, what if your grandma\u2019s condition doesn\u2019t change? You\u2019re just not going to go home?", "Having read your comments, YTA. It sounds like your husband has made genuine efforts to find childcare and has been unsuccessful. So now he risks losing his job and putting your kids futures at risk. Stop being so selfish", "YTA.  You've basically said you're not helping, full stop.  Your parents and grandparents understand that you have children that you need to be there for.  I'm sorry, but you're being selfish.", "While you were not the a-hole to begin with, YTA now for refusing to help your created family back at home while with your immediate family. Your husband is not unreasonable whatsoever for asking for a timeframe so he can manage work or at the very least, give an expected timeframe to a nanny", "I read the title thinking this was going to be one of those where the husband is completely incompetent with taking care of his own kids, but honestly it sounds like he\u2019s been trying to hold things down and give you the space to deal with this and has just gotten to a point where he needs you to help a little bit. I think you\u2019re being a little bit unreasonable towards him. Which is understandable to a degree because I\u2019m sure this is a very hard situation for you, but I think you should try to look at it from your husbands perspective too. Maybe a soft YTA.", "YTA\n\nThe husband is right , his income is essential for your household and any normal job has only so much patience for open-ended vacations. There are handovers and delegation of tasks to be made and you are no only inconveniencing your husband' s work , but also his colleagues. I am  sure they have personal issues as well . I understand your initial reaction OP, but it has been 6 days, you could've helped at least try getting some assistance with the kids from afar or arrange for them to come to you etc..", "You\u2019re telling the breadwinner in your family in THIS economy that if his job doesn\u2019t like it, it\u2019s not the job for him? That\u2019s crazy. Point blank period, your grandmother would never endorse you sitting at her bedside at the absolute detriment of your family just on the off chance she may wake up. That sounds harsh, but no grandmother or mother worth their salt wants their kids kamikazing their own life to witness the end of theirs in their 90s. \n\nPrioritize your young children\u2019s future stability over your grandmother who has lived a long and hopefully beautiful life. Go home. YTA", "YTA. Look, I understand your grandparents are in a crisis but you're a parent now. You're 50% responsible for your kids well being. That means you don't cut and run and dump 6+ days of unplanned childcare for 3 kids on your working spouse without offering to help figure it out. And I don't mean you take 100% responsibility for figuring it out, I mean working like 50/50 partners to figure it out. If he's home juggling work and 3 kids, you can take 15 minutes to log into [care.com](https://care.com) and start look up nannies or post to your neighborhood group to see if anyone is willing to do an emergency summer babysitting gig. I've spent a lot of time at the bedside of sick family while juggling kids and a job and I can guarantee you that I found 15 minutes every few hours to help figure out kid coverage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd I hate to be blunt but your grandparents and parents are getting older and this won't be the time you need to juggle parenting with a family health crisis . You've got to figure out why you went into full blown panic mode over this and come up with some strategies that let you continue to contribute to your kids well being while you're away. And your Mom needs to get to her doctor and get better support- she doesn't really get to turn into \"a wreck\" and suck up 100% of your dad's caretaking energy right now. Of the three of you, you're the one with three young children. You and your dad need to start juggling time at the hospital so you have time to work [care.com](https://care.com) and other childcare sites.", "YTA. I understand your in pain. But you need to take care of your kids. Throwing away your husbands job is irresponsible. If he loses his job can you affords a few months with no pay.  It takes time to find a good job and then longer to get your first paycheck.", "YTA. Your initial reaction was understandable, but continuing to be away from your family without giving your husband a timeline of when you will be back so he can communicate with his *employer* is completely unreasonable, especially since your husband is responsible for the bulk of your household's income. \n\nFrom your comments, he has tried every option available for childcare, to no avail. If you plan to be gone indefinitely, then you should have your kids there with you, especially if your husband is afraid he might actually lose his job over this.", "Reluctant YTA.\n\nI unfortunately am familiar with dealing with family emergencies and hospital visits. While I don\u2019t begrudge you at all for your initial need to only focus on getting home you have now been there for almost a week.\n\nEvery day with dealing with hospital visits and touch and go family members is a roller coaster. But there are moments, if not hours, where you can\u2019t be with the person and can focus on other things. You also aren\u2019t the main caretaker here - that\u2019s likely your mom. You have minimal say in care. While being there to support your mother and grandparents is important, when you look at the bigger picture there is so much that needs to be done and only so much you can do.\n\nYour husband isn\u2019t asking for anything unreasonable. He needs help finding childcare or he needs to tell his work he is taking a leave. There are long term, permanent consequences to not giving him an answer. He\u2019s right to be concerned about supporting your family.\n\nI understand you want to be there for your parents and grandparents. However, you are also a parent.

Your husband is trying his best to work as a team with you. His income is essential to supporting you and to keeping your children fed and well.
