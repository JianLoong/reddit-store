It feels like unconditional love has some t's & c's.", "NTA.  Their relationship with him sucks because they totally ignored what *he* wanted in favor of what *they* thought he should do because it would make *them* happy.  The fact they\u2019re still pushing means they haven\u2019t actually learned anything from the experience, which makes it extremely smart of him to maintain strict boundaries, and *you* a good sibling for not being yet another person trying to stomp all over those.", "NTA. It's your house, and you are not their mediator. That's great they took initiative to do therapy and improve, but it sounds like they have a little ways left to go.", "NTA. It sounds like your brother and parents have a lot of past trauma to heal. That\u2019s going to take time and needs to be done properly. Not by them getting you to ask you brother and doing this all in front of everyone.", "NTA. Everyone is responsible for their own relationships. If your parents want to fix things, they should take the initiative. You are not Dr Phil and it\u2019s not your job to be peacemaker.", "NTA they can invite him", "NTA - your brother said he has plans and is going to his in-laws - you have no reason to invite him", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLEt THEM make the effort to apologize and fix their relationship.", "NTA.  They already have plans. Plus, they need to be the ones speaking to him. It is their relationship with their son that they messed up with. They need to be the ones to fix it.  Just stay out of it like you've been doing.", "NTA. Sounds like they need a little more therapy. Or a lot. But they are 100% wrong for trying to put you in the middle, especially over something like Christmas. You are absolutely correct in being concerned about the relationship between you and your brother being damaged, and you are right to refuse.", "NTA", "NTA But you couldn't invite them honestly, ie. without hiding the presence of your parents. And they can choose to decline. Im not sure how extending the offer threatens your relationship with your brother unless you were to try and lie about it. It sounds like they already have plans, so they may say \"no we already have plans\" and then your parents can't be mad at you all holiday long.", "NTA, but I don't think you're in the right necessarily. It's not your decision if your brother and his family tries to patch things up with your parents. The option should be extended to your brother to make that choice. \nThings probably would be awkward, and I don't blame you for not wanting that, but they are trying to make an effort and you can help with that at the cost of some discomfort and small talk at dinner. \n\nI know Reddit struggles with the idea of previously bad parents wanting to reconnect with their children, but let's look at it from their point of view and your brothers, rather than yours;\n\nYour parents have realised they were wrong. They attended therapy, they've proven to be better with your kids, and regret how they treated your brother. They want to make amends and have things patched up. \n\nYour brother is willing to be civil with them and willing to patch things up, slowly and steadily with boundaries. \n\nAnd you're there as a go between, someone who both parties are happy to be with and spend time with, who they have a good relationship with. A holiday dinner, spent together with both families, is a much better interaction than a meet up between just your parents and your brother on an uneventful day where they're there specifically focussing on making up, if that makes sense. \n\nA lot of people will say your parents don't deserve the chance, but let's face it they do if your brother says they do. If you invite him and he says no, that's at least the choice he made. If he says yes, it means he sees it as a good opportunity for growth, and I personally think you should be supportive of that, even at the cost of some awkwardness. \n\nBut that's just my opinion.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would, for the sake of your sanity/time/energy, tell them them that you are happy that they want to fix their relationship with your bro but in order to do that they need to directly deal with him to work on fixing their bridge to him.  They cannot cheat by bypassing the work needed on their bridge by using your sturdy bridge to brother.  \n\nCheating shows they don\u2019t want to actually fix their relationship, they just want a free pass to reset it to where it was before brother gave up.  And if people and relationships were more like computers maybe that would work but they are not.  You cannot just reboot a relationship aka bridge that was likely already on its last legs after the way they put undue pressure  on it for many formative years and did not put effort into maintaining it, fixing broken or strained areas, helping fix major structural issues that were design flaws or original build flaws they helped to create or build.  Etc.\n\nThey really should put more effort into working on the health of the bridge on their end first before approaching him on helping fix the rest of it.  Once they\u2019ve done the work they\u2019ll realize how trying to cheat would have made it worse for them to actually fix their relationship.  And may have caused damage to the one between you and your brother in the process.  \n\nI like using these mental aids to help in making others understand these complex issues.  Especially for those still working on leveling their emotional maturity/intelligence.  Particularly if their starting level is closer to emotional maturity of a cactus than the experienced adults they are.", "You are not a parent trying to arbitrate between two arguing children or teenagers.

And somehow you don\u2019t identify that in and of itself as a condition?", "Nothing in life is unconditional. Even your parents love for you is because they made or adopted you. If you weren't their child, they wouldn't love you. Is that not a condition for receiving their love?", "So if you don\u2019t believe there is such a thing as unconditional love why would you claim that after 18 it\u2019s not unconditional anymore?"]}
