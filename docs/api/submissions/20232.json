My stepmother is Mexican American.  \nI have always loved to learn new languages. I am currently studying Dutch because my ancestry made me interested in it. My stepmom 43F has been in my life long enough to know about my language learning passion. My bio-mom isn't in my life at the moment and my stepmom fulfilling that role for me. She is doing a good job in my opinion. She cars about me a lot.   \nSince my bio-mom isn't in my life my stepmom has wanted to have a closer bond with me. I don't mind that and I want it to. However, one thing bothers me. She knows about my language learning passion and wants me to learn Spanish so we could speak to each other in it. I don't hate the Spanish language but I'm not interested in it. I study Dutch because I have Dutch ancestry and because It allows me to read the diary of my Dutch great-grandfather. Spanish doesn't have that connection and history to me to convince me to put in the time and energy to learn it.  I tell my stepmom this but she doesn't get it.  \nA weird thing she does is try to spanishize my name. If my name was \"Mary\" (not my name just an example) she'll try to call me \"Maria.\" I tell her I find this weird and she'll apologize but call me the same name just a few minutes later. When I ask why she says its to get me used to being in a latin household with her. I find this response really weird so I just accepted being called a more Spanish version of my name in order to avoid that conversation.  \nTonight I was home alone with stepmom. A situation like that allows her to talk to me on a much deeper level. So over dinner we talk. It was a good talk for the most part. She talked about her love for me and I was flattered. Because my bio-mom isn't in my life she has proposed that I be adopted by her. I'm still thinking about that but she mentioned indirectly during our conversation. \"If you're going to be the daughter of a Latina like me you should learn Spanish to connect with your culture.\"   \nI have always found her obsession with me learning Spanish annoying. One more time I state that Spanish has no significance to me and that she can forget about me ever learning it. I finished my meal and went to my room to watch a movie.   \nHalf way into the movie stepmom comes into my room and asks me for an apology. Apparently by stating that Spanish has no meaning to me I insulted her culture and heritage.   \nI don't feel like I did any of that. What is your opinion, redditors?", "created_utc": 1687330678, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14f06id/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_that_i_wont_learn_her/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You keep saying Spanish has no cultural significance to you - but your stepmother is connected to it, and wants to share that with you. She\u2019s trying to connect with you. Now if you said she was new, or you had no relationship with her, or she was awful to you, sure you wouldn\u2019t want that. But if you otherwise have a connection, she\u2019s trying to give you, a language lover, the gift of her language.", "Learning Spanish in America would serve you very well.", "NAH but I think you're foolish to knock back the opportunity to learn Spanish with help from a Spanish speaker. It's SUCH a useful language to know and will definitely help you in the future more than Dutch (also a great language, not putting that down).\n\nProbably an apology wouldn't hurt. I think she misunderstood what you said.", "NAH, but I thought you \"have always loved learning new languages.\" Why NOT learn a little Spanish from someone you care about who loves you too? The language and culture have significance to HER.", "You do kind of sound like an AH. Obviously it's your choice to learn or not learn whatever language you want to. But when you go on and on about how much Dutch language and your Heritage means to you and how Spanish doesn't have any connection or interest for you, you are kind of indirectly saying you don't really consider your step mom as a mom. You could have just said you are already learning a lot of languages currently and taking on one more would disturb the learning process, instead of saying how you have zero interest and no connection to it. I bet what she hears is that you feel no connection to her. \n\nI feel like even if you learnt the most basic phrases in Spanish and used them it would make her happy. But  you seem weirdly resentful about any attempt from her to share her culture with you.", "Spanish has no significance to you?\n\nCould you have just spit in her face and been more hurtful ?\n\nYou\u2019re learning Dutch because of a family connection.\n\nYou\u2019re refusing Spanish because it has \u201cno significance\u201d to you = SHE has no significance to you.\n\nYTA that was hurtful.", "NTA, but I can see your stepmom point of view.\n\nUltimately no one can force you to learn a language you're not interested in. By pushing her culture so hard on you, your stepmom is kind of disrespecting your own. But I can also see why she wants to share all that with you: this matters a lot to her and you matter a lot to her, and she wants to pass down something she believes is important to you. She is just doing it the worst way possible, she only turn you off from learning all this even more.\n\nNow, saying that Spanish and latin culture has no connection to you is also incorrect, *this is the language and culture of the woman raising you as her own daughter.*This is not nothing, whether or not you value that connection is another question, but it's still there.", "It kind of feels like you are being less than honest here. It makes no sense that you would be so adamant against such a common, useful language. I can\u2019t help but think this is some reflection of how you think of her and her culture. Like you don\u2019t want to be associated with a Latina or really do have a racial hang up about thinking Dutch is somehow more sophisticated than Spanish in your head, or deliberately make a point of refusing to keep her in her place - not as important as she\u2019d like to be to you. \n\nYTA I think you are being a brat.", "I'm not judging you one way or another but while you have an emotional connection to the dutch language it won't give you the same edge as Spanish would. I do not know if you are in the US but speaking Spanish is definitely super useful here. Also you could learn both, dutch and Spanish at the same time.\nJust to clarify, I'm not a native Spanish speaker I'm learning it as a third language.", "If I\u2019m being honest YTA but also NTA. YTA because you disrespected her after she cared for you and even though it has no significance to you it wouldn\u2019t hurt to learn a bit so you can speak with her. You\u2019re NTA because she needs to understand that you don\u2019t need to learn Spanish if she adopts you and she needs to understand that you can make your own decisions.", "It looks as if your stepmom wants to recognize something of herself in you. She isn\u2019t in your blood, and she thinks that speaking the same different language could show the world and herself how important she is to you.\n\nFor you, learning dutch is a way to connect to your dads family, plus it is something that makes you more unique.\n\nI\u2019m not sure, I would go for NAH. You for not wanting to add another language. Your stepmom isn\u2019t, because she wants you to feel like a real daughter. \n\nIs their really no chance to pick up some Spanish classes at a school, since there is such a large Spanish speaking community? After all, Dutch kids are taught French, German, English and some of them even Spanish- so one could deliberate that taking classes in different languages is part of the Dutch inheritance.", "NTA, you have every right to not want to learn spanish and maybe she is pushing too hard, but i personally think it's weird that you feel a deeper connection with a great greatmother that you probably never met than with the woman who is raising you and wants to adopt you and become your mother.\nObviously she will be hurt by your decision.", "YTA. But I say that gently and without judgement!\n\nYour stepmother clearly loves you so much. She's raising you, and she wants to adopt you. She's excited for you to legally become her daughter. She wants you to be a part of her family. \n\nYou enjoy learning dutch because it helps you connect with your ancestry. You get to read your great grandfather's diaries. That's awesome. That's your family's history. But your family history is still being written.\n\nThere are living, breathing new family members right in front of you. And they speak Spanish!\n\nYou say Spanish has no meaning to you. But this is the language of a woman who loves you very  much, and wants you to be her daughter. How much of your stepmother's life are you missing out on because you don't know Spanish? What would be written in her diary, if you could read it?\n\nKeep learning Dutch. And if you're not ready for your stepmother to adopt you, that's absolutely and completely okay. But understand that when she asks you to learn Spanish, what she's really saying is, I love you and I want you to join my family. You saying that you'll never learn the language because it means nothing to you is a pretty harsh rejection of all that. Not realizing that is what makes you the AH. \n\nSorry! But again no judgement. I wish you the best in life and your language learning journey!", "YTA It sounds like you are American, how long have you lived in the Netherlands? Do you ever have any intention of visiting? I've visited many times, their English is impeccable and widely spoken.\n\nYou have a perfect opportunity to learn a language, a very useful language, a language you would have the opportunity to use in your daily life, a language that is widely spoken in your country.\n\nYou have decided to be spiteful to your step mother.", "NAH. With a caveat: \n\nI too, love learning languages. My stepson is half Japanese, I tried, I failed. But I gave it a go and still take (a somewhat feigned) interest because it helps him feel comfortable and accepted. \n\nLanguage and culture are completely intertwined and cannot be teased apart from one another, and it is a very significant part of one\u2019s personal makeup. Can you find a way to meet in the middle? Connect to her culture in other ways such as through food or art?  X", "NTA. But I think you might be missing the point.\n\nYour stepmom wants to have a closer connection to you, a more special family bond.\n\nFamily, language, traditions are a huge part of the Latin culture, and she wants you to be part of that. She\u2019s focused on language because she knows it\u2019s a passion of yours and is trying to find that greater feeling of family with you through it.\n\nIs there another area that might work for you? Learning about her family and upbringing, cooking with her, that sort of thing?", "I'm going to go with NAH", "NTA. If you love someone, you don't love them less because they can't speak your language. I am married to my Canadian Born Chinese husband. And even though he is trying to learn my mother tounge Vietnamese, I never feel the urge to learn his 2nd language (Cantonese). He still loves me the same and even more every day.", "Maybe not the AH since you can do whatever you choose to do that interests you but you do seem kinda .. AH for other reasons. No significance to you but your step mother has wanted to share her culture & native tongue with you - but no significance to you? Don\u2019t want to learn since \u2018nobody speaks spanish around you,\u2019 but want to speak dutch. I understand it\u2019s your culture, but her wanting to share her culture with you is a beautiful thing & I would of felt honored. You\u2019re also able to get many more opportunities in life being bilingual. I wish I had a parent who would love me to share their culture like that with me but hey, it\u2019s your life and you can decide what you want to do with it - not an AH for that i guess \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. Manny picked French and he's Gloria's son, you can pick dutch.\nBut I also think the question is poorly asked because it's not about learning Spanish but prioritizing Spanish over Dutch and this is a T A move from your stepmom. You already have no contact with your bio mom, it's only understandable you want a deeper connection with your blood-related side of the family. Should explain this to her.", "NTA.\n\nWhile it would be nice for everyone involved for you to learn her native language, it's certainly something she can't force on you. It's not just about the language though, she's trying to force you into her culture. That's not how a loving parent should behave. Since you have \"deep conversations\" with her I assume her English is at a fluent or close to fluent level. You can communicate effectively in one language, anything else is a bonus, not a requirement.\n\nLearning a language takes a *lot* of time and effort; I can understand why you wouldn't want to do it especially since you are already learning a language. \n\nIs there a father figure in the picture?", "NTA\n\nYou don't want to learn Spanish (at least right now), so you won't learn Spanish, simple as that.\n\nI get that your stepmother wants to have this additional connection but the conversation should be something like this:\n\nSM \"Hey, I know you like learning languages. I would gladly help you learn Spanish\"\n\nYou \"Thanks but to be honest, I am not interested\"\n\nSM \"Oh ok, I thought it might be a good way to bond. Anyway, if you ever change your mind just tell me, yes?\"\n\n\nEnd of story.", "YTA. It just sounds like you\u2019re digging in your heels to be an asshole. Stop telling everyone you enjoy learning new languages when you clearly don\u2019t. It feels like you actually enjoy telling your stepmom her culture is not meaningful to you. By your own admission she is stepping up in a role she really doesn\u2019t have to do. Plenty of people marry others with kids and not only don\u2019t want anything to do with their step kids, actively dislike them. I don\u2019t think you understand how lucky you are (or maybe you do, you are just that much of an asshole) but you come across as completely condescending. Your stepmom aside, learning Spanish living in America should be a requirement and would serve you later on anyway.", "NTA\n\nI get that your SM is trying to bond with you. She wants to be your mother and wants you as her daughter. Not SD, daughter. That includes you being a Latina. \n\nBut the thing is, it's your life and choices. She asked, you declined. Asking once was fair. But declining was your right too. \n\nNot accepting your answer, forcing her will on you and  manipulating you is controlling behaviour and a AH move. \n\nSo no. You are NTA. \n\nOn an additional note, if you really do love your SM, learning a bit of Spanish for her sake would be a good idea. I get you have no interest in the language and feel no connection to it. But it would indeed make your SM happy. It would make her feel you see her as mother just the way she sees you as her daughter.", "NTA for not wanting to learn a language BUT Spanish will help you infinitely more than Dutch will. You're American and the two biggest languages are English and Spanish. \n\nMy grandparents are 100% Scottish and moved to England 60 years ago, but I am not Scottish, I'm English. Now, I am not judging you AT ALL, but it may be worth considering the below:\n\nI grew up in Spain, in an area of it that is inundated with Dutch people, and if there's one thing they will tell you it's to learn EVERYTHING you can linguistically. \n\nThey are a people of language, the Netherlands is TINY and historically being multilingual helped them trade. 77% of Dutch people speak 3 languages conversationally, and over half speak 4.\n\nI would say you'd be connecting with your ancestors MORE by taking in as many languages as you can, even if it holds no significance for you.\n\nPlus being in the states, Spanish is absolutely a bonus.", "NTA but kind of a little...you say you love learning languages? Do you say that because you literally learned one other language ? Maybe you just like learning Dutch and not languages in general.\n\nI think your stepmom feels like rejecting her language is rejecting part of her and I get that.\n\nYou should work on your empathy", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIgnore her drama.", "Why limit yourself to learning just one language next to american English? Dutch is my first language but have added several more to that. I feel that knowing the language of the countries next to yours is often beneficial so adding Spanish and French to your vocabulary will open up your world in an amazing way. I have moved to another country and learned that language and am now working on learning more of the languages from my new neighbor countries.\n\nLearning more languages only has advantages. And to make someone you care for happy by learning a bit of Spanish will only enrich your life.\n\nEdit: NTA as it is ultimately your choice if you want want to learn another language but the way you reacted wasn\u2019t that nice/respectful.", "NTA It\u2019s up to you what languages you want to learn and why, and her constantly trying to pressure you into learning Spanish is only making you less and less likely to ever want to. \n\nBut it sounds like you do really care about your stepmom, so I\u2019d propose a slight compromise. Learn some common phrases in Spanish and pepper them into your conversations with her. They don\u2019t have to be big or complicated, and make sure she knows it\u2019s not a prelude to you learning the whole language, but that it\u2019s your effort to connect to her culture better and to be open to her more. Just things like \u201chow are you feeling today\u201d, and how to respond to her answers. When you leave the house say goodbye to her in Spanish, thank her in Spanish, those little things to make her feel a little more like her culture is also a part of your household. And trust me, those few phrases take almost no time or effort to learn. You can have them all memorized in under a week, with just a little practice per day. Twenty to thirty incredibly short and easy phrases to make her super happy? Please tell me you care enough to take five or six hours of your life and do that? (It shouldn\u2019t even take that long, it\u2019ll probably take longest to decide what 20/30 phrases you want to pick!)\n\nAnother thing you could do, if it\u2019s up your alley at all, its ask her about cooking/her cuisine. I know I\u2019m generalizing, but most people I\u2019ve met with Mexican and South American heritage *love* to talk about their traditional food and love to cook. If she\u2019s in that group it\u2019s another great way to bond and learn about her culture. Have her teach you her favourite dish. You gotta eat anyways! And honestly? Mexicans definitely have the Dutch/Germans beat\u2026 unless you plan on learning to make your own sausage. Which is\u2026 kinda yuck. I\u2019m not saying Dutch and German food doesn\u2019t taste good, but it\u2019s pretty uniform meatstuffs, root veggies, and thick sauces.", "Yta, racist vibes, Dutch is fking useless were you live", "NTA, but it also wouldn't kill you to learn a little bit of Spanish. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's bad on your stepmom to try and force it and her culture upon on you, but knowing some Spanish isn't gonna hurt you. I'm Greek-American and I learned enough Spanish to communicate with patients in the emergency room. Even if there's not a lot of Spanish speaking patients; it's still a useful skill to have for a lot of different environments throughout the US (even in North Dakota).", "NTA and she needs to stop trying to push it on you. There is no legit reason for you to be learning it, as you've already stated. (Plus just in general)", "YTA\n\nYou do realise that you have no bio-mum in your life now, and soon no stepmom either.\n\nAnd if your dad loves his wife, you will probably find yourself without him as soon as you turn 18 and he no longer has to deal with your shit. Because while you are not an AH for not wanting to learn a language, how you went about it is, and your attitude that comes across in your replies to other commenters makes it certain that it was deliberate on your end, and that you are probably an AH in general life.", "I think you're missing a trick tbh; Spanish is an incredibly useful language to be able to speak and I think it's short sighted of you not to take the opportunity to learn. Dutch is awesome, and you should definitely continue with this, but 'I love languages...but I don't want to learn Spanish' - I can see why your stepmother is disappointed. Then there's this attitude:\n\n'> NTA, but it also wouldn't kill you to learn a little bit of Spanish.\n\nNo but it would take time and energy that I don't want to give.'\n\nI mean...that's lovely, isn't it? Your stepmother wants you to try something and you cba. My Scottish neice is learning Welsh and it means the absolute world to me that she makes that effort.\n\nI need a YTF (you're the fool) judgement.", "You sound insufferable. Yes you are the AH. And not very practical since Spanish is a\nLanguage used in 21 countries. Also a Romance language that can facilitate the learning of languages such as Portuguese, Italian etc.  You also like you think you\u2019re superior because your Dutch- German Heritage and look down at the Mexican lady who has been nice to you.", "Maybe a soft yta.\nYes you don\u2019t have much direct connection to Mexican culture but it would still be kind to learn Spanish. Learning this language will do no harm. It\u2019ll just enrich your experience on this earth. Your stepmom probably just wants to feel like she\u2019s passing on her legacy to whom she views as her next of kin.\nI think it\u2019s great you\u2019re learning Dutch. Connecting with your ancestry and cultural heritage is awesome. I am half Mexican myself but I wasn\u2019t taught anything Mexican related. I have a whole language and culture I should be apart of but I\u2019m not. Honestly kinda jealous that your stepmom wants to teach you about her culture.", "YTA for lying about your love for learning new languages.\n\nAnd the racist vibe you give of.", "I\u2019m going NAH here. But you are missing the point. She is trying to share something that\u2019s important to her (her culture) and tie it to something that\u2019s meaningful to you (your interest in languages). You don\u2019t have to learn Spanish, but you do have to communicate better in the language you both speak. You can tell her that you don\u2019t need to learn her language to love and appreciate her. You can put effort into other interests you have in common. She\u2019s reaching out and waiting for you to reach back.", "YTA.\n\nI don\u2019t know what vibe you\u2019re trying to give off, but it\u2019s incredibly biased. Imagine being your stepmother, who has done nothing but love you and your father, and done everything that she can to fill in the shoes of your mother, and even wants to adopt you, and wants to include you into her language and her culture, and imagine being told that \u201cthe energy and time couldn\u2019t be put into it\u201d. YET, she has to watch you learn a whole language in order to read a journal, and maybe the culture around it.\n\nThat\u2019s super disrespectful. \n\nYou\u2019re well within your rights to not want to take on another language at the same time as another. Learning one language is hard enough. But don\u2019t try and play it off that you love learning languages when in reality it\u2019s only if YOU think they\u2019re worth it.\n\nSpanish is such an amazing language and one that is used far more widely than Dutch. \n\nYou should apologize to your stepmother and put in some more effort here to repair this relationship because all you\u2019re doing is hurting her by being selfish.\n\nAdditional info: judging by the fact OP only chooses to respond to NTA comments, they\u2019re definitely riding a high horse and are probably not looking for sound advice but just wanting to hear that they\u2019re right no matter what.  YTA just for that alone.", "Learn the language. There\u2019s literally no downside.", "Yta because how you handled this and your attitude about her culture and history, you don't ask why she gifts you a Latino name or the differences or to be a part of her family, you just lash out and be a brat.", "I'm trying really hard to see why you care if it's not a biased thing about being possibly perceived as Latina. You having your name lantinized or whatever doesnt seem weird to me at all. Idk why you care. \n\nAnd it would be one thing if you just werent interested in learning new languages because it is alot of work, especially in adulthood. But if it's something you already enjoy I dont get why learning Spanish would be such a hindrance. Even to learn a few things, not to be fluent. Hell, I can speak mediocre Spanish... okay I can pick out some words lol. But out of all the languages, it's probably one of the easiest coming from english", "NTA, your stepmother is being pushy and disrespecting your boundaries and interests.", "NTA\n\nI understand why you are stressed about how your step mother is trying to seemingly force a language on you that you aren't comfortable with, but I do think you went a little too far or rather, I don't think you were as careful with your words or thoughts as you should have been.\n\nShe needs to respect your space, and she is only making you learning Spanish less likely as you are clearly building some amount of resentment, but you need to be a bit more careful about showing her respect. She wants to be family with you, it's not a stretch to say that she loves you. So when you say \"I have no connection to Spanish, but I do have a family connection to dutch\", it's not insane that her take away or abstraction of your statement is \"I don't have a connection to YOU\".\n\nTo be honest a lot of this seems like teenage bickering. Which is fine, it happens. But try to move beyond this a little. You don't have to learn Spanish now, but why close yourself off to it forever. That's the harshest part. Why not try, even just some phrases. I'm sure it'd mean the world for your stepmom if you even just used some Spanish words over English ones. And I'm sure you could have fun doing it. Just give it a bit more thought, maybe.", "You're not the asshole for not being interested to learn something in particular, but YTA for how you said it to her. Like one of the comments brilliantly pointed out, you say that learning spanish or the spanish language doesn't interest you, and what she hears is *My stepmom doesn't interest me*. \n\nYou say \"I don't think I was insulting\" but it doesn't matter what YOU think if someone is hurt by what you said. To them, it was rude and impolite and, in my very personal opinion, the least you can do is recognize that what you said was hurtful to them and that you are sorry you hurt them.", "YTA. Learning Spanish would be very useful in the US; I learned enough to get by 14 years ago working with a kitchen staff of all Spanish speaking people and I use it at least twice a week. Learning Spanish would also make learning other Romance languages easier in the future. You\u2019re trying so hard to stick it to your stepmom that you\u2019re limiting yourself. I understand how it feels to have something shoved in your face until you just plain refuse to do it on principle, and as much as I hate to admit it, the only person I was screwing was myself. Try to remove her influence from the decision and look at it another way. If you get up to fluency, there are scores of jobs that will pay you more for being able to speak Spanish.", "Spanish is her heritage. Not yours. Don't let her drag you into it. If anything this experience will cause you to want to learn the language even less I would think.

My stepmother is Mexican American.  \nI have always loved to learn new languages. I am currently studying Dutch because my ancestry made me interested in it. My stepmom 43F has been in my life long enough to know about my language learning passion. My bio-mom isn't in my life at the moment and my stepmom fulfilling that role for me. She is doing a good job in my opinion. She cars about me a lot.   \nSince my bio-mom isn't in my life my stepmom has wanted to have a closer bond with me. I don't mind that and I want it to. However, one thing bothers me. She knows about my language learning passion and wants me to learn Spanish so we could speak to each other in it. I don't hate the Spanish language but I'm not interested in it. I study Dutch because I have Dutch ancestry and because It allows me to read the diary of my Dutch great-grandfather. Spanish doesn't have that connection and history to me to convince me to put in the time and energy to learn it.  I tell my stepmom this but she doesn't get it.  \nA weird thing she does is try to spanishize my name. If my name was \"Mary\" (not my name just an example) she'll try to call me \"Maria.\" I tell her I find this weird and she'll apologize but call me the same name just a few minutes later. When I ask why she says its to get me used to being in a latin household with her. I find this response really weird so I just accepted being called a more Spanish version of my name in order to avoid that conversation.  \nTonight I was home alone with stepmom. A situation like that allows her to talk to me on a much deeper level. So over dinner we talk. It was a good talk for the most part. She talked about her love for me and I was flattered. Because my bio-mom isn't in my life she has proposed that I be adopted by her. I'm still thinking about that but she mentioned indirectly during our conversation. \"If you're going to be the daughter of a Latina like me you should learn Spanish to connect with your culture.\"   \nI have always found her obsession with me learning Spanish annoying. One more time I state that Spanish has no significance to me and that she can forget about me ever learning it. I finished my meal and went to my room to watch a movie.   \nHalf way into the movie stepmom comes into my room and asks me for an apology. Apparently by stating that Spanish has no meaning to me I insulted her culture and heritage.   \nI don't feel like I did any of that. What is your opinion, redditors?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You just aren't interested in learning Spanish right now, and that's fine. It is nationally a more practical language to know, but that doesn't mean you have to chose it. Perhaps you could have been more diplomatic in your conversation regarding it, however it also seems she's been forcing the issue for a long time despite your established disinterest. Forcing it to that level, even if it comes from a good place of attempting to connect with you, is a bigger issue than responding how you say you have. Her calling you by a name you've tried to ask her not to is also an issue. To use your example, would she be ok with you calling her Mary instead of Maria because you think she needs to get used to being in a non-latin houshold with you?\n\nIt would likely be a good idea to arrange for a conversation regarding all of this in which you plan ahead how to chose your words in order to remain as diplomatic as possible. I would bring up that her changing your name despite requests to stop is disrespectful. And that although you value your relationship with her, it does not change your culture which you have grown up with.

Maybe cook Mexican and Dutch food or something. I believe she just wants to hear you love her and show an interest in her.\n\nAlso if you ever cook German food, go with bavarian food!

The amazing thing about America is that it\u2019s made up of all these different cultures, and traditions come from a variety of sources. It\u2019s possible to have more than one culture, and it\u2019s possible to enjoy or celebrate multiple cultures at the same time.

Also, is not someone hi just married OP\u2019s father, is someone stepped up when OP\u2019s mom was absent, someone who want to adopt OP so clearly is someone who loves OP.  Huuuuuuge ungrateful ass", "vindictive is aggressive. id say petty.", "How sensitive do u gotta be tho lmao?? My Spanish teacher would call people in my class by their Spanish name if they had an English one and they all loved it. She was simply trying to include everyone and we thought it was pretty cute and funny.  I definitely agree that it\u2019s annoying if OP\u2019s stepmom does it all the time and she should respect OP on that for sure, but I really don\u2019t think she\u2019s pushing her culture that hard on her. OP honestly seems like a super entitled person to be around. To be so stuck up about learning a language when you said u \u2018love\u2019 learning languages is just stupid. If u love learning them and ur stepmom speaks Spanish and would love u to learn, why shut her down and completely refuse to?

Just the way OP had basically said there\u2019s nobody that speaks it and no significance to her whilst their step mothers culture was obviously so important to her she had wanted to share it with her step child left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.

It has no significance to op, op has no interest in it. That IS preference. OP is NOT being ungrateful just because they have no interest in a certain language.

That honestly has never been my thing. I guess you were eating kroketten/frikandel/bitterbal or something like that. Very unhealthy fast food lol\n\nI like the stampot meals and mostly a lot of in season veggies.\n\nTry pinterest and look for dutch recipes. I had to reinvent some of my mom and grandma\u2019s staples as I wasn\u2019t that much in to cooking till I had my own kids and they were unfortunately not around anymore to ask for recipes.\n\nSome of the best stuff is fresh ingredients and making it all from scratch.\n\nDo know that the Netherlands is such a mix of cultures that you get a wide variety of dutchified recipes from all over the world (which is pretty awesome in my opinion).", "to me what i said was in a joking tone that obviously doesn\u2019t convey over text. it was a joke, i defend myself against backlash, have a nice day", "It being obvious to you doesn\u2019t make it so to everyone else. No one can magically read your tone over text. Some people are better at it than others. \n\nAgain, weird that you said it multiple times if it was just a one off joke, but okay. Have a good day."]}
