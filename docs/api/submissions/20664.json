I was going to take my partner but we broke up shortly before. \n\nWhen my brother heard we weren't together anymore he gave my +1 away. The invite was for myself + 1, not myself + partner, so I had invited a friend to attend with me instead. \nAround three days before the wedding he told me that I could no longer have the +1 as he had given the seat to somebody else. My +1 had travelled to my house for this event and was already there and ready to rock and roll.\nThis really upset me so I chewed my brother out, cancelled my own attendance and stayed at home with my friend.\n\nFast forward to now, he's getting married again next year on my mother's 50th birthday (First one was a divorce within 2 years). My mother really wants me to be there and asked me to put the past behind me, I am okay with this so I said if he apologies I will also apologise and we'll move on.\n\nThe issue is that she is vehemently defending him over our falling out, saying I'm spiteful and I only think of myself. She said nothing about his poor communication and that he told me days before the wedding that my +1 was no longer valid. She just going in circles and asking me to do it for her but now I'm extremely angry because she's basically blaming me for the whole thing.\n\nI spoke to her not long ago on the phone and I ended up shouting at her because she would not let it go that it was all my fault. \nI love my mother very very much but this just hurts me. I tried to explain from my perspective but she just dismisses it and claims \"you were in a bad place back then\" - which has nothing to do with and wouldn't have affected anything wedding related. \n\nIt feels like she's using my mental health as a crutch rather than addressing how crappy my brother was to do that to me, now I don't know what to feel, I'm still just so angry.\n\nAITA for this? I'll gladly accept the verdict if I am, I just need to know...\n\nETA: I was single when I first received the invite, I just happened to be taking my partner when we got together.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm a hot-headed, stubborn, petty AH and I accept that, thanks for setting me straight.\nI'm currently on the phone to my mother booking our rooms for his wedding.", "created_utc": 1687793716, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14jkjrp/aita_for_screaming_at_my_mother_today_and/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now, I understand that space can be limited so making changes is sometimes necessary, but doing it 3 days prior when the person has already traveled puts this squarely on your brother.  \n\nI also don't think this is worth arguing about years after the fact.

However, him waiting until 3 days before the wedding to update you that your +1 had been revoked is an AH move.\n\nYour mum\u2019s attitude sucks too.

Have a lot less contact with her, give her fewer oportunities to abuse you.", "ESH since he did do it on short notice but also you ignored him for 4 years over something that petty?", "YTA. You skipped your brother's wedding over a miscommunication which frankly, was very easy for him to assume you would no longer need a +1. Not only that but you've held on to this for FOUR YEARS, and expect an apology from him? No, he doesn't owe you one. Go celebrate him (and your mom) this time around and try to mend fences. The original situation is really not worth the pettiness and drama you are now causing.", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t your wedding. If you weren\u2019t in a relationship then you might not have had the +1 to begin with. \n\nIt sucks that your friend traveled there for it but you should\u2019ve cleared that with your brother and his fianc\u00e9 prior to inviting someone else.", "ESH\n\nIt was shitty that your brother rescinded the +1 without informing you beforehand, but it was his wedding, and he should be free to choose who goes to the wedding. Regardless, this could have been avoided with a simple conversation.\n\nIt's unfair to you that your mother is defending your brother and blaming you for falling out, despite the fact that your brother's actions were hurtful. I don't think she should have gotten involved, but I digress.\n\nYou mention being \"okay\" with putting the past behind you, but you give the ultimatum of \"if he apologizes, then I'll apologize.\" Right or wrong, if you were really open to moving past this, you wouldn't need an apology. You'd just move past it.", "YTA. \n\nThis is really common. Even if you weren\u2019t with your partner when you originally got your +1. You had it, confirmed your partners attendance, and then broke up. It\u2019s not that weird, mean, or rude that he gave it to someone else knowing you guys had broke up. More communication definitely could have been used all-around, but I think you\u2019re the AH for taking it so far and even skipping his wedding (and not talking to him for four years!) because of it.", "NTA fuck the both of them, it's obvious your family's trash and you can and will do better without them", "YTA\n\nHe didn't want a rando at the wedding, that was for a date, and you didn't have a date. Sounds like the family is better off without you around.", "NTA. You can say, if he does not apologise now, you can attend to his next wedding.", "It was shitty of your bro to take away your +1 & it's shitty of your mom to blame you.  Your bro owes you an apology for not communicating it to you in a timely fashion.  Now, are you being petty? Yeah, a little bit.  But I still firmly believe your bro owes an apology.

She's mentioned this maybe four times since it's happened, so four times in four years. She just really wants us to move past it, and I don't think she realised how much she hurts me when she defends him. \n\nIt's been long enough, I do want to air it so we can celebrate next year. \n\nI was angry when I posted this because I'd just played defence on the phone, but I can absolutely understand why my mother wants her children to talk to each other. I believe we were both wrong with how this all went down. My pettiness has lost us years as a solid family.", "I was angry when typing this and may have gone a little overboard, as you can probably tell I am quite hot-headed. I don't expect an apology in all fairness, I  want to discuss and clear the air so we can celebrate our mom, I just hit defence-mode when my mom goes at me and instantly get angry (that's a me problem, I know).

I'm happy to let bygones be bygones, I would like us both to acknowledge that we fucked up  to clear the air and start a fresh chapter. I don't expect an apology, just a productive discussion so that we can move forward.\n\nThanks for your judgement.", "This is fair. I didn't actually confirm with a name, we just agreed I would be there and another person could come with. I think the miscommunication was when we split up a couple of weeks before so my brother assumed I didn't want/need it any more, my original +1 was going to one of my friends, not a particular person, just whoever I felt like bringing. \n\nI do accept your judgement, and I know I'm petty for holding a four year grudge, I am very hotheaded and stubborn. I am going to apologise for being a dick.", "He told me I could bring anybody, he really wasn't arsed about it being a rando. \n\nYou're very dramatic, you sound like you'd cut your mum off for making a bacon sandwich instead of sausage...\n\nThanks for your judgement.", "> I'm going to reconcile with him either way. I've been stubborn and bitter for four years and that's four years of family time I can't get back.\n\nThat's great and a very mature position to take.  You can either be right and miserable or chalk it up to just an unfortunate set of events and get on with life.", "did he know you invited someone else ?", "I'm sorry but this is very likely the wrong take to make, she clearly favours him and that's never going to improve, you were in no way in the wrong cutting contact with someone who treated you so poorly, and while your mother might be an amazing woman, she failed spectacularly here as a mom. She's failed you, and she continues to do so. You deserve better than these people. \n\nThat said, give it a try with them, just be cautious, and look out for any other golden child/scapegoat shenanigans", "Ironic from the one that cut off contact with family and started screaming at their mother because they couldn't bring their friend to their brother's wedding. That is very narcissistic behavior.", "Thank you. I'll admit that at some point my bitterness turned to shame that I've acted so negatively,  so I avoided the topic because I didn't want to admit how petty not speaking to him for so long was.\nI know that it was stupid and childish, so I just deflected every time somebody mentioned it and then got defensive and angry because I was embarrassed. \n\nI needed the opinion of others to solidify to myself that I need to get over it, stop causing a rift, and enjoy the time we have.", "Your comment was quite meh so I thought I'd make a joke, irony is dead. My bad..."]}
