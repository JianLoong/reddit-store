My bad...", "ESH, but mostly you. I read the comments; when you and your partner broke up a few weeks before the wedding, your brother assumed you weren't going to find another wedding date in time, and saw an opportunity to let someone else come. (Wedding guest lists and deciding who to cut can be very stressful!) \nYour brother is the AH because his lack of communication resulted in your friend traveling for a wedding he couldn't attend. \nBut you really overreacted. You were a bridesmaid and pulled out three days before the wedding, adding unnecessary stress for your brother, and I assume your SIL, and possibly the groomsman who had to go solo.\nAnd carrying a grudge for 4 years over this is absolutely bonkers.\n\nFrom reading your comments, it seems like you know what to do to move forward. Best of luck!", "ESH.  Probably desperate for the space he blew it by not letting you know of the change right away. You have way overreacted and have held onto this for a Long time.  You didn't go.  You hung out with your friend.  That's it.  Move on.", "I imagine when you broke up, your brother figured you wouldn't be coming with anyone, so they extended an invite to someone else. Should he have communicated about it with you sooner? Yes. But wedding planning is stressful and it probably slipped his mind. Poor communication on his part, but also understandable.\n\nThat said, you probably could have/should have just touched base with him after the breakup to make sure you could still bring a +1 to the wedding. Poor communication on your part.\n\nYou were going to be a bridesmaid and attend your brother's wedding, but because of poor communication on both sides, you bailed at the last minute.

It was still with the intention of bringing a date if I have a SO by then, not for a friend.

Your feelings in this didn\u2019t even register to your brother. I\u2019m not getting the people who say it\u2019s normal for the +1 to be a date only, but I assume that\u2019s a regional thing. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case where you are. You should have been given way more notice that it was taken away, or given back to you when you said someone travelled to come with you. You might \u201cmight\u201d have overreacted in the moment, that\u2019s life, who doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s all so much worse on your brother that his marriage didn\u2019t even last!! I know what it\u2019s like to have a mother who blames everything on my mental health which is ridiculous, wrong and unhelpful. She\u2019s in the wrong as well for taking sides. You both have valid arguments. Still doesn\u2019t make you the AH. I would definitely let bygones be bygones if it feels right to you, not just to make everyone else happy. If you want to do it, talk to your brother before the wedding. Apologize. If he can\u2019t reciprocate, you can at least say you tried, but it\u2019ll likely be used against you anyway if he doesn\u2019t apologize too.

If he communicated better this wouldnt have happened, but I've honestly only ever heard about a +1 when it involves a SO. I never heard about taking a random friend over.

I would have been pissed that all of a sudden I lost my +1 without being told.   THAT would have been the polite thing to do.  Just go and say nothing to anyone about his last wedding.    Anyone brings it up, calmly reply that that incident is in the past and we don\u2019t need to discuss it anymore.   Is this matter really worth fighting about?  You don\u2019t have to accept or reject fault in the matter, just refuse to discuss it and remind mom/brother that it is water under the bridge and not necessary to discuss anymore.

I can see where easily you informing him you're not taking your partner means you are coming alone - it's a stupid assumption, sure, but it's very easy to make the jump to \"they're coming alone.\" You staying with your friend is also fine, especially after you invited her and you were also going through a break-up at the time. Everyone was in a flurry of emotion. Your mom is TA really for defending your brother so strongly and pushing down you feelings of hurt.\n\nHowever, it's been 4 years. It really was not that big of a deal, my friend.

He was the AH then, but being so petty about it now is so wild to me. Let it go it was a wedding that didn't last. Your mom also isn't helping, you, your brother and mom just need to let it go.

We can discuss the unfairness of amatonormativity all you want, but dropping out because of this when you were a bridesmaid makes you TA.", "A little bit of an AH, let me explain. Your original invitation was you plus 1 and the plus one was someone I would think he and his then fiancee knew. You broke up and wanted to bring someone else that I am assuming your bother and fiancee may not have known. People are often antsy about having strangers at their weddings. I don't defend it, it's just a thing I see in a LOT of these wedding posts. They spend a lot of money on food and don't always want to feed strangers. There was a lack of communication on both your parts at the first wedding. He should have said I'm gonna give your extra seat to someone else and you should have said hey I've asked my friend to come with me to the wedding. I think it might be a good time to sit down with him and talk it out instead of staying mad at each other and putting your mom in the middle. You're adults, not children fighting over a toy.", "YTA - you skipped your brother's wedding and haven't spoken to him in 4 years over a minor miscommunication?\n\nYou sound like an insane person.", "Yta I\u2019d honestly do the same as your brother. I\u2019d give the seat away too but he should\u2019ve told you before your friend booked anything", "YTA by a tremendous amount", "YTA, most people don't want to give a plus 1, weddings are expensive.  They usually do because the person has a partner and it would be rude not to invite your sister's partner. They are trying to accommodate you, not just to add a person for the sake of adding them. Adding some friend is rude imo", "YTA. \n\n1) you ignored him for 4 years over miscommunication? that\u2019s stupid. stop holding grudges let it go. it was 4 years ago and not a big deal\n\n2) most of the time a +1 is for a date. either way tho it doesn\u2019t matter. you could have told him and been like \u201chey so and so is coming with me to the wedding\u201d. you\u2019re talking about how he didn\u2019t communicate.. why didn\u2019t you? \n\n3) not going to the wedding over that is incredibly rude. you were supposed to be a bridesmaid. you probably made the groomsman have to walk down by himself. \n\noverall you should apologize for your actions, as well as he should. you need to learn to let things go that aren\u2019t a big deal. i mean 4 years ? come on.", "Oh yh could be for sure buddo", "NTA- taking away your +1 on the day of the event was a dick move. I would still expect an apology, but idk I\u2019d go to his wedding, if you want to move forward in your relationship.", "ESH it was OK of him to rescind your plus one, but not three days before the wedding when your friend had already arrived to join you. You should have at least gone to the wedding ceremony, because he\u2019s your brother and it sounds like you were close at one point.  This is not something that should\u2019ve taken four years to move past.", "NTA \n- Brother is in the wrong\n- Mom is unfair and would drive me nuts\n- You shouldn't cut complete contact for something relatively small\n- You're the petty queen", "Do you guys purposely try and hurt one another? Screaming at your mother or anyone? A 4 year estrangement over a plus one at a wedding: 'Only if he apologizes? Keep it going for another 4 years. I'm hot-headed. That's just an excuse so you don't have to control yourself. Do you take responsibility for it? Doubt it, 4 years. Maybe work on being nice to one another. Forgive one another. Do what it takes. Screaming at your Mother?YTA. Did that accomplish anything except provoke hurt?", "YTA. I don\u2019t know if this is a cultural difference or what but you don\u2019t bring just anyone to a family wedding. Where I\u2019m from partners rarely come unless they\u2019re well established. Weddings are expensive and the bride and groom should always have final say over who\u2019s there, it would be really weird for someone who\u2019s never met them there. It wasn\u2019t your wedding, and while I don\u2019t agree with her approach, your mother is right that you should really try to move on from this rather than letting it destroy your relationship with your brother", "NTA.\n\nTell him you'll consider attending the 3rd wedding.", "NTA. Tell him you're too hurt to come to this wedding but you'll gladly come to his 3rd.", "Do you want them to put \u201cI wish I had been mad longer\u201d on your tombstone.\n\nWho cares.  It\u2019s your brother!  Let this go and move on.\n\nYTA", "NTA honestly you would have been the asshole had you abandoned your friend", "Not enough info, did you talk to him about keep your plus one or did you just assume he would be okay with you bringing a friend instead? i think is a clear lack of communication from both of y\u2019all", "NTA- it\u2019s not your moms job to insert herself into the relationships of her adult children. You should refuse to discuss it with her. Only tell your brother what you want or need from him or what you will or womt do", "The NtA votes are completely absurd...ESH minimum", "+1 arent concert tix, you cant just trade ppl in and out and cant sell em on stubhub", "Agreed. The friend had already traveled to attend, but OP hadn't even thought to mention it to her brother that she was bringing this person. I would have thought it was pretty basic courtesy to let the hosts know who you're planning on bringing. He failed to in assuming OP wasn't going to bring someone sure, but damn the punishment was pretty severe. IMO bailing on being in the wedding party days before the wedding is pretty strong, honestly going no contact after missing the wedding is kind of a given.\n\n If I were OP I would be skeptical that bro even wants her back in his life after the message she sent that day. This sounds just like wishful thinking from mom gone toxic.", "Abuse? Do you know what that word means... bc I don't think you do. Get a grip on reality.", "This is a minor slight that should've been addressed in a timely manner. Cutting contact for four years is just emotionally immature and petty.", "If you\u2019re told you have a +1 then you are entitled to bring someone to the wedding, that\u2019s the point of a +1, unless the invite was addressed to \u201cX and Y\u201d", "OP made a dumb decision  and double downed by never talking to him again", "She prob reads reddit, where redditors constantly tell people to divorce or go no contact over little things. Was legit in an argument today over people telling someone to go no contact with parents cuz they asked for rent when they turned 18", "Thank you, some sanity", "Former SIL prob reads this sub where if husband spills milk only answer is divorce", "The classic no contact lol", "But does that excuse the mother defending her son giving away her +1 and blaming her daughter (OP) for \u201cbeing in a bad place\u201d???", "Wrong!", "I still would have been because he\u2019s being selfish to his alleged \u201cfamily.\u201d You!", "Look it up. A +1 grants an invited guest permission to bring someone with them to an event.", "You can\u2019t move past it until your brother grows up and admits he\u2019s wrong! 3 months would be one thing. 3 days is an AH move!", "You need to see a therapist and figure your shit out before you ruin more of your most important relationships over minor things.", "You know you don't have to bring a plus 1 right? And its her family, not like she wouldn't know anyone there", "I know it\u2019s ridiculous. How easy we forget why we fell in love in the first place. I never want to b low or no contact with my family. Even if I am completely right, family first and I would get over it.", "That's reddit for ya no contact or divorce at evey little thing", "It's possible she's saying \"look it was ridiculously unfair to bail as bridesmaid and disavow your brother because you assumed wrongly that you could bring your friend without mentioning it beforehand. We understand it was a rough time for you, but we want to move on...\"", "Yes.  Giving away the plus one is the wedding party's prerogative.  Doing it without asking is only low grade crappy.  Brother had a reason to presume it would be okay. OP bailed as a bridesmaid and and has been estranged for four years over it.  OP's anger lasted literally longer than the marriage.\n\nAll that is evident without reading between the lines.  OP has admitted to anger control issues and flying off the handle inappropriately.  For all we know, what mom actually said was actually entirely reasonable and kind.", "They usually give them to married or with a partner so they can bring them. It's not an excuse to being some rando coworker or something. The entitlement on this post is insane", "This is one of the most absurd combination of words I've ever read", "If your brother doesn't feel the sane way, he doesn't deserve your generosity. I don't see where you were the bad guy in the story. Like, at all.", "No they don\u2019t. They invite a married couple as a married couple. Look it up already. This is an extremely common and well known practice. You don\u2019t have to offer a single person a +1 but if you do, they pick their own date. There may be unspoken expectations, but that\u2019s beside the point.", "Fair, but I'd argue that \"unspoken expectations\"  very often THE point are to many an argument...", "They weren't married tho, they were dating. Do you honestly think the brother would rather have her sister's friend over his cousin or something? No, but it would be rude not to invite your sister's bf. Second they broke up it would be obvious to anyone the plus one is gone too. Pay for 100 bucks a plate and you'll realize", "I don\u2019t get what you\u2019re not understanding.  If they were married, there would not have been a +1. They would have both been invited. So that is off the table. \n\nSince the sister is a relative she got a +1. It may have been assumed that she was going to bring a particular person but if you CONFIRM that you are bringing someone, you should as that plate is already purchased. If you have a breakup, the right thing to do is find a date.  This literally happens ALL THE TIME. \n\nHad the brother told her earlier that he needed the plate for another guest, the sister would have had no problem if he\u2019d done that in a reasonable timeframe. She has stated that several times in this thread. Three days before, when the person she invited has already traveled to the location is certainly not a reasonable timeframe.", "No, you don't try to fill it for sake of filling it, thats rude af. That plate should go to someone close to the bride/groom, not some rando u find on street. Main character syndrome to the max"]}
