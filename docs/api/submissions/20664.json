My bad...", "ESH, but mostly you. I read the comments; when you and your partner broke up a few weeks before the wedding, your brother assumed you weren't going to find another wedding date in time, and saw an opportunity to let someone else come. (Wedding guest lists and deciding who to cut can be very stressful!) \nYour brother is the AH because his lack of communication resulted in your friend traveling for a wedding he couldn't attend. \nBut you really overreacted. You were a bridesmaid and pulled out three days before the wedding, adding unnecessary stress for your brother, and I assume your SIL, and possibly the groomsman who had to go solo.\nAnd carrying a grudge for 4 years over this is absolutely bonkers.\n\nFrom reading your comments, it seems like you know what to do to move forward. Best of luck!", "ESH.  Probably desperate for the space he blew it by not letting you know of the change right away. You have way overreacted and have held onto this for a Long time.  You didn't go.  You hung out with your friend.  That's it.  Move on.", "I imagine when you broke up, your brother figured you wouldn't be coming with anyone, so they extended an invite to someone else. Should he have communicated about it with you sooner? Yes. But wedding planning is stressful and it probably slipped his mind. Poor communication on his part, but also understandable.\n\nThat said, you probably could have/should have just touched base with him after the breakup to make sure you could still bring a +1 to the wedding. Poor communication on your part.\n\nYou were going to be a bridesmaid and attend your brother's wedding, but because of poor communication on both sides, you bailed at the last minute.

It was still with the intention of bringing a date if I have a SO by then, not for a friend.

Your feelings in this didn\u2019t even register to your brother. I\u2019m not getting the people who say it\u2019s normal for the +1 to be a date only, but I assume that\u2019s a regional thing. It doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case where you are. You should have been given way more notice that it was taken away, or given back to you when you said someone travelled to come with you. You might \u201cmight\u201d have overreacted in the moment, that\u2019s life, who doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s all so much worse on your brother that his marriage didn\u2019t even last!! I know what it\u2019s like to have a mother who blames everything on my mental health which is ridiculous, wrong and unhelpful. She\u2019s in the wrong as well for taking sides. You both have valid arguments. Still doesn\u2019t make you the AH. I would definitely let bygones be bygones if it feels right to you, not just to make everyone else happy. If you want to do it, talk to your brother before the wedding. Apologize. If he can\u2019t reciprocate, you can at least say you tried, but it\u2019ll likely be used against you anyway if he doesn\u2019t apologize too.

If he communicated better this wouldnt have happened, but I've honestly only ever heard about a +1 when it involves a SO. I never heard about taking a random friend over.

I would have been pissed that all of a sudden I lost my +1 without being told.   THAT would have been the polite thing to do.  Just go and say nothing to anyone about his last wedding.    Anyone brings it up, calmly reply that that incident is in the past and we don\u2019t need to discuss it anymore.   Is this matter really worth fighting about?  You don\u2019t have to accept or reject fault in the matter, just refuse to discuss it and remind mom/brother that it is water under the bridge and not necessary to discuss anymore.

I can see where easily you informing him you're not taking your partner means you are coming alone - it's a stupid assumption, sure, but it's very easy to make the jump to \"they're coming alone.\" You staying with your friend is also fine, especially after you invited her and you were also going through a break-up at the time. Everyone was in a flurry of emotion. Your mom is TA really for defending your brother so strongly and pushing down you feelings of hurt.\n\nHowever, it's been 4 years.

He was the AH then, but being so petty about it now is so wild to me. Let it go it was a wedding that didn't last. Your mom also isn't helping, you, your brother and mom just need to let it go.

If I invite a sibling with a partner, and they break up, I would assume that sibling would give me a heads up about who the other person that's coming to MY wedding is.  \"Hey, Mary can't come, any issues with me brining Tom instead?\"  Seems weird that you wouldn't tell your own brother who is going to come to his wedding.)", "OP, how did you change that +1?  That's the key factor here.\n\nIf it went from \"Mary and I will be there\" to \"Mary can't make it\" then 100% YTA. You didn't communicate that you still needed that +1.  You don't get to just hold on to it and use it or not use it and pick a surprise guest if you want to right before the wedding.  There's a reason you have to RSVP, so they can plan everything.  You essentially were trying to bring a guest to a wedding without telling anyone. (and all wedding etiquette backs this up.)\n\nIf you said \"Mary and I will be there\" and then \"Mary can't make it, I'm going to bring Tom instead\" then NTA, since you gave the update right away, the +1 was always being used, and your brother always knew who it was, and he cancelled an expected guest.\n\nSo which is it?", "YTA \nI'm not saying that your brother was right for cancelling your +1, he's kinda TA too, but you MISSED his wedding because of it. To me, thats an overreaction alone and then not talking to him for four years? I understand it was probably really frustrating having your +1 cancelled but its not that deep when hes your family. It was poor communication from him and weddings are stressful. And he probably missed you on one of the BIGGEST days of his life. I think you're blowing things out of proportion and being unable to forgive and forget. I mean... 4 YEARS!!", "You are petty and stubborn, you might be A H for shouting at your mom, but NTA for missing your brother's wedding", ">him waiting until 3 days before the wedding to update you that your +1 had been revoked is an AH move.\n\nThe tough part is that OP doesn't tell us how that communication went.  If someone said to me \"Mary and I will be there!\" and then later \"Mary can no longer make it,\" it would be reasonable to assume that there isn't a replacement.  If the message was \"Mary can no longer make it, I'm going to see if my friend can\" then it's a jerk move to cancel the +1 without letting OP know.\n\nIn my mind, the +1 is no longer a generic +1 once there is a name associated with it, and it would be on OP to be clear that the +1 is still wanted.  It's the brothers wedding, so the update should have been \"Mary can't make it, is it OK if I bring Tom instead?\"  Seems like running a guest change by the actual groom is the appropriate thing to do.  You don't do surprise guest swaps at someone else's wedding.", "I recently got married and had a limited amount of guests\u2026 I had groups of friends whose partners didn\u2019t get a plus one (because there were like 6 of them who knew each other), one asked if they could bring their partner and I added a plus one for them\u2026 other friends who were invited that didn\u2019t know anyone else that would be at my wedding definitely got a +1 because going to wedding where you only know either the bride or groom without a +1 is brutal/awks\u2026 but the +1 wasn\u2019t reserved to just romantic partners\u2026 could have been literally anyone and I didn\u2019t ask beyond confirming the amount of people attending.", "Think you might have missed the very first part.\nCopied & pasted from your link.\nIf you were in a long-term relationship when the invitation was sent and your ex-S.O.\u2019s name is written on it, don\u2019t just sub someone else in.\n\nShe got the invitation before she was even with boyfriend, so I highly doubt his name was on it.\n\nNTA. but you did overreact by not speaking to him for 4yrs.", "That link literally says don\u2019t swap out a named invitee with a different guest. OP\u2019s invite was OP and plus one. No one was named on the invite other than OP soooo doesn\u2019t break the etiquette of that blog", "The brother 100% had every right to revoke the +1 but he gave OP the +1 prior to her being in a relationship. When she and her partner broke up there should have been a conversation and there wasn\u2019t. \n\nIf OP said \u201chey me and SO split so they won\u2019t be coming anymore\u201d\n\nMy response would have been \u201cthat sucks, I\u2019m sorry. Did you want to bring someone else instead?\u201d\n\nBrother didn\u2019t do that and then told her 3 days before the wedding that he gave away her +1\n\nThat\u2019s an AH move. She\u2019s held a petty grudge for 4 years. They both suck and the mum isn\u2019t any better. Which is why my vote is ESH", ">partner, so I had invited a friend to attend with me instead. Around three days before the wedding he told me that I could no longer have the +1 as he had given the seat to somebody else. My +1 had travelled to my house for\n\nIt was never stated that OP and partner broke up weeks before the wedding. OP simply said 'shortly' before the wedding. Also no information on when brother finally HEARD that they had broken up.  \n\n\nThere was poor communication on both sides but due to the overreaction by OP, I'm going to go with YTA.", "Lol there\u2019s legitimately a comment on her telling her to go LC with her \u201cabusive\u201d mother. Reddit is wild.", "Is it really \"giving away\" the +1? We don't know how it went.  If someone said \"Mary and I will be there\" and then later \"Mary can't make it\" that implies the +1 isn't needed.  It should be \"Mary can't make it, is it OK if I bring Tom instead?\"  To me OP was being kind of rude by doing a surprise guest swap at someone elses wedding.  OP should have given a heads up about the change to the actual groom, and not just gone with the assumption that they could use or not use the +1 however they wanted without telling the groom.", "Yeah frankly I know it's common to only allow +1 for dates but I do think it kinda sucks that just because you're single, couples don't think you want someone there at a wedding where you don't know anyone. Sucks that only partnered people are afforded the courtesy.", "Oh be quiet", "Because he's not.\n\nIt was his wedding, he paid for those seats and has the right to ammend attendance so as to not throw money away. There was absolutely a  failure of communication, but both parties are equally responsible for that and OPs reaction has been grossly disproportionate."]}
