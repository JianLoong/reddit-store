{"id": 14141, "submission_id": "12dojlm", "title": "AITA for calling her a psycho for how she reacted to my dog?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 \"Jen\" and I have been together for 6 years now and I wanted a dog 2 years ago. There's been some unforeseen issues surrounding this because the dog has some behaviors that Jen doesn't like at all and there's been some conflicting opinions on what's acceptable and what isn't. I'm admittedly a lot more of a dog person than she is. I have a lot more patience and I don't see the problem with things she does. Like I don't mind the dog sleeping on the bed but Jen refuses to allow it because she doesn't want the dog on her at all when she's trying to sleep. Or I don't think that table scraps are bad and will sometimes give the dog some but Jen outright refuses because she fully believes it's enforcing begging behavior, which she finds insufferable. She won't let them dog in the kitchen when she's cooking and doesn't want the dog near her when she's eating because of the begging and whining that sometimes comes along with it. And lastly, the big one, she doesn't want the dog on her under any circumstances. She has grown to not show my dog any sort of affection because my dog wants kisses and will put her forehead to yours whenever she is in your lap. It's the only way my dog will sit and I will admit that the dog wants to be held like this very, very frequently. So Jen won't even show her affection because she absolutely hates the dog in her face and she has told me several times I need to stop giving in and allowing the dog on my lap every single time she tries because I'm \"enforcing codependency\". As you can see.. conflicting opinions. \n\nAnyways, Jen just got herself something to eat. My dog was laying in the kennel but as soon as she saw Jens food, she came out and big stretched while staring at Jen. She then started sniffing the air while simply looking in Jens direction and while she did inch closer, she didn't get too close. She just sat down and watched Jen eat. Jen then rolls her eyes and fully turns herself around so the dog can't watch her. Which, whatever. But then the dog started whining and wanted me to pick her up and was still staring at Jen so I said \"aww momma doesn't want the poor doggo to have any yummy foods\". The dog then jumped from my lap and moved to a position where she could watch Jen. Before I could even say anything to correct the dog, Jen says \"You have about two fucking seconds to get your dog away from me and FUCKING STOP enforcing the behaviors you know I hate or I'm gone.\" I told her she was a fucking psycho for treating the dog like this and if she had just waited two fucking seconds I would have gotten the dog from her. She got up and threw her food away and has since locked herself away in our shared bedroom and will not come out. AITA?\n\nETA: She just handed me her ring, said \"nice reddit post asshole\" and left after saying she was getting a U-Haul to move her shit.

OP using the word psycho doesn't give anyone free licenses.

You were well aware of her feelings and ignored them, causing her to blow up. You baby-talked to the pup when she was already annoyed, further upsetting her. \n\nYTA", "YTA for calling her a \"fucking psycho.\" She doesn't like dogs and it's clear you didn't work out any sort of compromises before you go one. \n\nI like dogs and even I'm put off by the behavior you describe here. You can train dogs to not beg like that; it's annoying (and you can still give them table scraps later). Not everyone likes a pet on them. I def don't like pets on the bed at night.\n\nI think you'll have to choose between your dog and your GF, if she hasn't decided to end things already. At least you found out your incompatibilities before the wedding.", "YTA - Jen communicated her boundaries to you, and you very explicitly communicated back that you didn't give a fuck. You showed Jen that you value the dog's comfort over her own. Why are you even with Jen, if you view her as less of a partner in the relationship than your pet?", "YTA.  Giving a dog table scraps, encouraging begging, and encouraging behavior you know your fiancee hates is a good way to get rid of your fiancee.  Calling her a psycho means she's probably leaving.", "YTA. You two are not compatible. Jen's boundaries are pretty reasonable- she doesn't want the dog on her or in her face or begging for food. You seem to be fine with all that. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> But then the dog started whining and wanted me to pick her up and was still staring at Jen so I said \"aww momma doesn't want the poor doggo to have any yummy foods\". \n\nYou intentionally did that as a jab at your girlfriend. News flash- dogs should not be eating table scraps. Ask the vet if you don't believe it.", "I swear these shitty dog owners posts are getting out of control", "Uhhh did you guys even discuss getting a dog before you got one?", "YTA in that situation, certainly. Calling someone \"Psycho\" is always an asshole act. It's not ok do do you someone who is experiencing psychotic symptoms, nor is its use as a hyperbolic insult okay. It's really a mental health slur and crosses the line in dismissive but also high stakes insult towards a partner who is already angry with you. At the same time, you haven't communicated anything about what you've done wrong-made light of her discomfort with the dog getting in her face and begging for food, acknowledged empathy for what's difficult for her-living with a dog when she isn't a dog person, or honestly stated what's difficult for you-Jen insisting you train your dog to change behaviors you seem to really enjoy.\n\nRecognize that you are the asshole, though. She isn't mad at the dog, she's mad at you. \n\nYou both have issues around the dog's behavior, but you've been ignoring her requests to dog train the dog's behavior around her, at least, and persisting with you attempts to \"Jen train\" and, at least in this case, \"Jen shame\" instead. If you can't have an honest conversation about these issues, then it's something to learn to do for the future of your relationship. If costs weren't a factor, I would recommend a session or two with a couple's communication therapist where you each look at what you most want, untangle some assumptions you are both making, and agree on what your ideal situation would be, with the well-being of the dog being included in that. Then three of you go to an animal behaviorist to come up with a training plan. Training a pet not to beg for table scraps and to at least have a command/redirect to move away from people's faces are actually pretty common things to teach a dog, and many dog's enjoy training. It's not just telling the dog \"no\", but usually a special dog bed \"place\" and going to lie down there is part of their training.", "Run Jen. Run.", "YTA. Train your fucking dog.", "So according to your comments, Jen never wanted the dog and only agreed on the condition that you would train it...which you clearly never did. And now you have a dog with codependency issues that begs and whines every time she eats. I'm shocked it took this long for her to snap. And then you blew off her very explicitly communicated issues and called her a psycho. Obviously YTA", "YTA\n\nI love dogs, and your dog would drive me batshit just based on your descriptions here. Jen's rules are pretty much the same I've used for any dog I've had. Dogs don't sleep on human beds, dogs don't get table scraps, dogs are elsewhere during human meals and don't beg or engage.\n\nBut beyond that, your passive aggressive comment and reinforcement in the moment pushed you from asshole-over-time to asshole-right-now.", "Info: did Jen ever want the dog or did you just make the decision and brought it home?", "YTA. I worked with dogs for 5 years and your dog is insufferable", "YTA\u2026 I also find that behavior insufferable. Gross. You are letting your dog walk all over you and her. I can\u2019t imagine having a dog watch and whine every time I\u2019m trying to eat. Your girlfriend has set healthy boundaries for the dog which you are allowing and encouraging the dog to cross. I\u2019d leave for real. I feel bad for your girlfriend.", "YTA. I\u2019m pretty tired of this narrative that people who don\u2019t want dogs in their personal space are somehow uncaring or up tight or \u201cpsycho\u201d. It\u2019s an animal. Animals should be respected and cared for but never take precedence over the comfort and boundaries of another person. Train your dog.", "YTA. Train your dog. These things are all easily fixable! A lot of people can\u2019t stand being around an untrained dog. I don\u2019t let any of our animals in our kitchen, or watch us eat either. Watching people eat by staring is not trained! You are not a good dog owner. Your wife was blunt she didn\u2019t want a dog, and you did it anyways. Now you are upset she doesn\u2019t accept the dog? Selfish much? All this lead to you name calling. Name calling people is a form of abuse. She\u2019s going to leave you for being childish, and selfish. Stop giving your dog table scraps too! You can really hurt your dog one day giving it the wrong food. Not a good dog owner.", "YTA. Sounds like you badgered your ex fiance into getting a dog, then didn't properly train it, and called her a \"psycho\". Jen made the right call.", "Yta.  I am a dog person.   Ok with the dog in the bed.  But I hate dogs begging.  I get that.  Your dog needs training.   Also if you were living together before you got the dog, yta if you let the dog on the bed.  It's your partners bed as well. \n\nFind a trainer.", "You two obviously needed to have a conversation about getting a dog and expectations for the dog's behavior and training ... before you got the dog two years ago.\n\nJen has made it clear to you that there are some behaviors that are a deal-breaker for her when it comes to having a dog in the house: she doesn't want the dog all over her (in her lap, on the bed) and she really doesn't want to put up with annoying begging behavior when she's preparing and eating food. These are ... pretty reasonable, especially for someone who's not a dog person and/or who likes dogs but doesn't like dogs that are poorly behaved.\n\nIt sounds to me that it's been 2 years since you got the dog and you've done nothing to stop the behaviors that Jen finds upsetting, such as the begging. Is there some reason you can't teach the dog a \"place\" command so the dog will stay in a specific area while you're eating instead of whining at the table? That kind of bare minimum of training would probably make a massive difference for Jen and for better harmony in your home.\n\nI love dogs. I have dogs. I don't care if my dog is in my lap or sitting next to the table. BUT I also don't want my dog underfoot when I'm cooking or whining and trying to grab my food. That's just shit training and poor behavior.\n\nIf you're not willing to get on board with training the dog, then you and Jen are probably not going to work out in the long term. I think YTA for ignoring Jen's reasonable requests regarding the dog's behavior and not training the dog.", "YTA. Jen is 100% correct in her assessment of the dog and of you. You\u2019re not teaching your dog correctly and all you are doing is creating an anxious dog. \n>\nYou owe Jen (and your dog!) an apology and if you care about your dog you need to get a trainer for your dog who can also train you on how to be a better pet parent.", "YTA\n\nYour dog is not trained. You\u2019ve said your dog begs, whines, needs to constantly be held by you, literally whines at your feet until you pick her up, and you seem to be enforcing that.\n\nI\u2019d be super annoyed too.", "YTA. Decisions like how you train your dog to act affect BOTH OF YOU, not just you. If you were living by yourself, sure you can train your dog however tf you please! \n\nBut you live with another person who has their own boundaries and preferences. Your fiancee told you what she does and doesn't like, and you seem to have decided you don't care. \n\nYou dismiss her boundaries like that, then have the nerve to call her a psycho when she snaps at you? \n\nTrain your dog better. What your fiancee is asking of you is not unreasonable, but your reactions sure are.", "YTA, best of luck in your next relationship.  Find someone who shares your love of making dogs extremely co-dependent.", "YTA. You\u2019re a bad dog owner and not respecting your fianc\u00e9\u2019s boundaries.", "YTA\n\nyou have not educated yourself at all about dog training. also you never said that you and your partner agreed on certain behaviors that would be acceptable for the dog, and lastly, you don't respect your partners boundaries with the dog.", "YTA\n\n\nNot only are you the asshole for getting the dog at all. But your also the asshole for not training the dog and for encouraging bad behaviors. \n\nMy roommate failed to train their dog the same as you and now I cant eat in my own living room without being harassed but at least I can get away from dog. Your wife cant.", "So Jen doesn\u2019t want the dog sleeping in the bed, in the kitchen when she\u2019s cooking, and begging or whining for food when she\u2019s eating. I love dogs & this all seems very reasonable. Just train your dog. Your fianc\u00e9e but also your dog will be much happier.", "YTA. Jen repeatedly stayed her boundaries with the dog and you violated them. A begging dog IS annoying, a dog in a bed can definitely be annoying. My husband is obsessed with our dog and he had all the same rules as Jen because that is how you properly train a dog. I guarantee visitors to your house consider your dog untrained. You guys are clearly not compatible.", "YTA, take care of your dog and teach him", "YTA for making the dogs comfort more important than your partners. You deliberately cross boundaries she\u2019s established. You obviously don\u2019t respect her.", "YTA. This has nothing to do with her not being a dog person and everything to do with you being a crappy partner. I am a dog person and I would not want to be around your untrained dog. I was going to say you are going to be single if you do not train your dog and enforce boundaries but that ship has sailed.", "YTA - You absolutely reinforced bad behaviors in the dog, despite your partner repeatedly letting you know she didn't appreciate it, you mocked her not liking the behaviors, then called her names because she was mad that you weren't doing more to properly train your dog, and *THEN* your entire attitude about the breakdown of your relationship is \"Whatever.\" \n\nYou are 100% the AH here.", "INFO: is this your gf? https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12cjjpj/aita_for_refusing_to_run_errands_with_him_because/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "Literally look at my username. \n\nI'm telling you, YOU'RE WRONG HERE & YTA. \n\nI am the definition of a dog lady, it's my literal profession. I have 3 snuggling me as I type this comment. And I have all the same rules your ex-gf did. Dogs aren't allowed in the kitchen (simply bc it's the highest risk area of the home & it's annoying when they're under-foot while I'm frying something) and begging is an absolute NO. It sounds like she's much more educated about canines than you are. \n\nYou have a poorly trained animal & she repeatedly pointed it out. People who actually deeply love their dogs, make the effort to understand canine psychology & behavior. An extremely important aspect for a well-rounded pup is firm boundaries, discipline & routines. \n\nI see in your other comments that your dog is clearly suffering (key word!!) from separataion anxiety, meaning your dog has a lower QoL. Separation anxiety & codependency is NOT cute. It means your animal isn't well & is suffering. I would think as someone who loves dogs, that would mean enough that you would work quickly to alleviate that suffering. \n\nYou're not being kind to your dog. Just like a parent who spoils their kid & never says no, you're setting them up to fail. It's hard to be strict & maintain boundaries but the reward is a deep bond that cannot be described, only experienced. You won't understand until you train your dog & have it for at least 5 more years. But if you don't make the effort & those years still elapse, you still won't understand what I mean & that makes me sad.\n\nTrain your dog & enjoy being single.", "YTA - she\u2019s 100% correct you can\u2019t confuse the dog it\u2019ll only cause it to misbehave, you sound like you\u2019d be better off selling the dog and getting yourself a hamster", "YTA. i have had dogs all my life. they have rules just like children have rules. otherwise the dog becomes an obnoxious asshole. like your dog. you prioritized your dog over your partner and your dog was in the wrong (although that\u2019s your fault, not the dog\u2019s).", "YTA--as others have pointed out, your dog is poorly trained and your now ex-fiancee's boundaries are eminently reasonable. I love dogs and would absolutely not put up with that behavior.\n\nI'm glad to see she has ended her engagement with someone who clearly has no respect for her, so all's well that ends well, at least for \"Jen.\" Now please train your dog, for her sake as well as yours.", "YTA. Train your dog. And stop feeding the dog human food. It's not good for them.", "On some days I love dogs more than humans. But what you did wasn't okay, you didn't train your dog and now you're single. Are you happy now? Because that's on you, not even on the dog which wasn't trained. YTA.", "YTA.\n\nWhat part of \"Jen doesn't like dogs\" is hard for you to understand. She doesn't want your dog near her. She doesn't want her drooly face anywhere near her face or her food.\n\nShe tolerates the animal's presence for your sake, as long as it keeps out of her way and does not interfere with her enjoyment of her home.\n\nYou, on the other hand, like dogs. You want to make a fuss of your dog. You and Jen have very different attitudes towards dogs.\n\nJen hates:\n\n* Being referred to as a dog's \"momma\"\n* Having a dog near her\n* Smelling dog\n* Having a dog whining and begging for things around her\n\nSounds like Jen was never actually on board with getting a dog, and this is a problem. You're probably going to have to choose between Jen and the dog.", "Yta. \n\nYou know exactly how she feels about this behavior, and you encourage it.", "YTA because you are absolutely enforcing the behaviors that Jen does not like. Stop feeding the dog at all when you are at the table. You are rewarding the dog for begging. She already compromised because you have the dog. Do better or break up.", "YTA. She doesn't like dogs, some people don't.

You haven't taught your dog even the most basic of manners.", "YTA.  train your dog.", "YTA train your dog", "YTA.

It\u2019ll be just the two of you very soon. YTA", "YTA and need to train your dog out of these bad behaviors you've let it get used to.  You may tolerate it but she clearly doesn't and nor do alot of dog owners.  Begging from the table is one of the worst habits to allow and leads to exactly what happened here - the whining and being obnoxious any time anyone is eating or cooking anything.", "YTA. You two are not compatible. Not everyone is a dog person and having the dog in the bed with you and giving it table scraps reinforces bad behavior. It is fine if dogs sleep on a bed if both partners agree but she did not. Giving dogs table scraps encourages negative behaviors and can be bad for them. I think you should break up or rehome the dog. I am a dog person too. I just think forcing a pet on someone who does not want it and training it to misbehave is not funny. The dog is going to suffer and deserves better.", "YTA. I am also saying this while eating my lunch on the couch next to my dog who is completely ignoring me. Train your dog.", "YTA you can absolutely train a dog to ignore your food", "Yep, YTA. If you want other people to love your dog you should stop reinforcing behaviors people don\u2019t like. \n\nDo what\u2019s best for the dog. Teach doggo manners and enforce those. Happy dogs live happily with humans because manners.", "YTA. She\u2019s made her boundaries with the dog pretty clear, and you continue to insist on ignoring those boundaries and put your dogs preferences above your fianc\u00e9\u2019s.

There's been some unforeseen issues surrounding this because the dog has some behaviors that Jen doesn't like at all and there's been some conflicting opinions on what's acceptable and what isn't. I'm admittedly a lot more of a dog person than she is. I have a lot more patience and I don't see the problem with things she does.
