However, mine got accepted and they called me in for an audition at 9:00 AM. I have lots to do, including answer dozens of questions, perform a short monologue, read an original short story, etc.\n\nSo when my dad asked me to walk the dog less than two minutes after I woke up, I asked him if he could do it today so I could prepare for my audition in two hours. He said that only a week in and I was already betraying my dog and being a bad parent.\n\nI argued with him for a little bit, and he eventually agreed to take her for a walk, but said I was a terrible dog owner. I am now working on my audition preparation.\n\nEDIT: Yes, I had taken the dog into the backyard when she woke up to poo and pee. I did not know about the audition until the day before it was scheduled. Also I understand I am the asshole now and I apologized to my father. I have spend the last little bit pushing my audition prep time to play with/ occupy my dog and spend time with her.

A border/golden mix is typically very high energy. Walks aren't usually going to suffice alone, you need to be in puppy classes, providing socialization, and stimulating activities, otherwise you're going to have a frustrated and destructive dog. \n\nWhich all wasn't the point of your post, but I can't help it because = I'm doubtful you or your parents understand what you're getting into here.

You knew your dog would have to go out, and instead of getting up earlier or anything you just pawned it off, that\u2019s bad dog ownership. On top of that you argued for a bit, which is all time that could have been used to dog walk. I love people like yourself, I deal with them all the time at my job.

If you aren't prepared to lose sleep all the time to meet your dog's needs, re-home now while she's still a cute little puppy who hasn't yet developed dysfunctional habits from being neglected. This isn't about one morning, it's about a living creature depending on you for all of its needs.

It's okay to ask for help in advance if you know you're going to need it. If I know I have somewhere I need to/want to be then I'll look for someone willing to look after my dog as soon as I know. In this case, you didn't do that. I'm sure you've known about this audition for at least a couple of days. Why didn't you ask your dad if he could effectively puppysit today as soon as you knew?

You could have rearranged your schedule accordingly and gotten up a little earlier this morning so you'd have time to care for your puppy.", "I'm gonna go with ESH, but this only happened once. If this is a weekly occurrence I would change my response. People here are too quick to judge.", "NTA.\n\nAsking a favor when you have a good reason is not \"betraying your dog and being a bad parent\".  That's ridiculous and uncalled for.  I'm not blaming your dad for making you walk the dog, mind you - you obviously could make time for that - but your dad is an asshole for not simply saying no, that was all that would have been necessary.", "YTA. That's the reality of owning a dog. I have two. Sometimes I have to get up at 4am to get them out for a good run before I have an early shift. You have to adjust your life around dog ownership, especially with high energy breeds.", "YTA - the time you took to argue with your dad and write this post, you could have walked your dog twice. I second your dad's words \"Only a week in\" and you already go back on a decade long (or hopefully longer) commitment, just because it was slightly inconvenient. Quite frankly, your parents clearly expected better from you or you wouldn't have gotten the dog. The dog deserves better.", "YTA. He's correct.

Sounds like a nightmare honestly, a well bred purebred border collies (a working dog) are not great starting dogs unless you are incredibly prepared and dedicated. Working dogs thrive on schedules, best to start schedules and training young. \n\nA designer mutt almost always don\u2019t have great genetics because of lineage. Has its parents been tested for genetic diseases or other conditions? Are you prepared if it does have any hereditary diseases? Do you have enough time to train, give enrichment and care for this dog- they need more enrichment as they get older?", "Border Collie mix... Block out 10-15hr/week to spend with that dog. You basically signed up to have a 3yr old the next 5-7 years. Depending on the mix, walking may not be enough. I have an ACD that will run 3-5mi with me in the morning, then run another 3mi in the afternoon with my wife. The energy and drive is endless. You're not putting on running shoes in this house without also grabbing a leash.", "YTA I have been sick with walking pneumonia and guess what I still had to do. Walk my dogs. There is no excuse for you to not walk them. I don't care about your audition and guess who else doesn't care your dog. \n\nYou are the one who wanted the dog. And that means the responsibility falls on you to take care of it.", "YTA. Your dad knows from life experience that human beings gravitate towards the easy way out.  He stepped up for you and helped you out but he did so knowing helping you that time would turn into you assuming he would help you more and more.", "YTA\n\nGet up earlier.  It's that simple.", "YTA glad you recognized the mistake", "Reflect now on if you truly have time to care for a dog. Not just cuddle and think about it. This is a 15 year commitment, expensive and very time consuming, limiting all decisions you make\u2026car, apartment, job, dating, going out for fun.\nAll.\nDecisions.", "NTA unless it becomes a pattern. Why couldn\u2019t the walk be done after the audition (question for father not you)?", "NTA\nYou took the dog out, presumably fed dog, and played with dog.  11 week old puppies do not need walks.  They exert most of their energy through play, biting the crap out of their owners, and getting into things their not supposed to.  And I'm typing this as I once again trade with my 12 wo lab/golden puppy for a sock he isn't supposed to have.", "If you let the dog outside into the backyard, I don't see the need to walk the dog.  Am I missing something?  NTA.", "YTA.", "YTA. And I hope they will take away the dog and give it to someone who will take care of it.", "[removed]", "Border Collies need much longer than 5 minute walks.", "Welcome to the life of a dog owner.

Her parents are probably filled with regret right now.", "Bloody hell it's only been A WEEK?! I totally missed that! Here I was thinking \"missing one day is not that big of a deal if the dog has a yard to do its business, everyone slacks on the walks every once in a while\"... But starting to slip *in the first week of having a **puppy**, while it's still the \"shiny new toy\"??* You just know OP's going to be a terrible caregiver for the poor thing. I wonder how they will feel about having to do the same mundane dog tasks every day or multiple times in the same day, while they're so ill that they can barely function, or after an incredibly tough day at school/work, for 10+ years ...", "Exactly! Only children eventually grow up to be self sufficient and dogs require care for their entire life. Hopefully this is a wake up call for OP", "No joke, I\u2019m up 2 hours before I have to leave every day.  I need to feed and let out the dogs.  I have to feed the cats and clean the litter boxes.  I have to get dressed and pack my lunch.  And, most importantly, I need time to wake up and become human.", "ART students. the fight the system people of the world.  there is a reason they have a higher unemployment rate then other options.  poor puppy.", "This is incorrect.   An 11 week old puppy needs around an 8 minute walk. It's 5 minutes for every month of age at this point. They aren't fully vaccinated at this point and shouldn't be going on walks further than their property to reduce the risk.  The only reason to do a leashed walk at this time is to begin teaching leash manners.", "Technically, as it is the first week OP has the puppy, it is a weekly occurence. Might be nitpicky but it isn't a good look that something like this happens only one week in.", "He made a promise and is already going against it within a week. I get where his father is coming from.", "something makes me doubt you have a dog. If op has time to post on reddit, they have time to walk the puppy. since puppies are not allowed to walk for long. 10 minutes would be long enough. \n\nPuppies are easier to rehome then adult dogs. so yes, with OP showing they can't be bothered, a WEEK in, rehoming should be considered.", "They had time to post to Reddit while getting ready for audition, that\u2019s enough time to take the dog out.", "It's not about how big the ask is. OP said they would take of the dog and they're already backing out. OP isn't the only person who has shit to do. Part of caring for another living being is making time in your schedule for it.", "Puppies can\u2019t wait for you to get around to taking care of them, they need to go potty NOW. OP knew the interview was coming and SHOULD have asked dad for help before the morning of or done the interview prep the day before or gotten up earlier to take care of the puppy as was promised. Any of those scenarios would be OP doing a good job with responsibility.", "No, an 11 week old puppy shouldn't be off their property for a walk until fully vaccinated unless carried, which is around 16 weeks. Add in an 11 week old puppy should only be walked for 8 to 10 minutes.", "because a dog needs to be walked on time. its a puppy. they can't hold it for 30 minutes, nvm longer.", "I'm guessing because there'd be an accident in the house.", "Because the dog would probably pee or poop in the house.", "Partial comment stolen from: /u/KrunkenSailor \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10sljjp/aita_for_not_wanting_to_walk_my_dog_this_morning/j721ixy/\n\nBot Reported.", "It's an 11 week old puppy, so right now it doesn't need loads of exercise like it will later.\n\nBut it's soooo going to need it later (and training! and enrichment!)\n\nI have a three year old English Springer Spaniel. He didn't need loads of exercise when little - a little tug and fetch training and he was wiped. This morning? It's -8 and he's running laps around the backyard throwing snow into the air with his snout because he wants to feel the wind in his ears or some nonsense. Once he gets this out of his system, I'll take him for the first of 2-3 45 minute walks/fetch. Sigh. lol", "Not that much longer at 11 weeks. It's about 5 mins per month until dogs are fully grown", "The point of this went over your head. But ok, state the obvious.", "lol so cute thanks for the advice, babe", "Imo if you get your minor kid a pet you should be prepared for that to be your pet because that\u2019s generally what\u2019ll happen anyway. Obviously OP needs to take care of it, but you\u2019re right what\u2019s going to happen when/if they go to college? Or they have to live somewhere for a job?", "Username checks out.", "8 minutes is correct. but a puppy needs several small walks 8 minutes each. i would say 5x per day minimum, that makes 40 minutes. and i would not call 5 times the max, though the puppy does needs to sleep inbetween.", "Unless the puppy has to be walked to go to the bathroom, which according to the edit, was not the case here.", "They're not \"already backing out\" you're acting like they're giving up on the dog entirely already.", "Yeah- that's what I thought, from the edit they'd already let the puppy out in the garden, so I was confused about the walking. I didn't know if the guidelines differed in different countries.", "\ud83d\ude2d i aint mean it personal", "My cousins got a pet gecko when they were in elementary school. My aunt has been taking care of that gecko for years after they went off to school and moved out. (I have no idea how long geckos live, but it's definitely an old fat little guy and my aunt does love it.)", "Once or twice a day, if at all.  Puppies at that age get most of their exercise through play.  An 11 week old puppy sleeps 18 to 20 hours a day.  You're better off using that awake time, strengthening a bond through play and training.", "Even then, you should be keeping that puppy in safe areas away from other unknown dogs and potential viruses because they're not fully vaccinated, not traipsing around the block.", "They are backing out. They backed on plans to walk the dog.", "you can't walk a puppy later. that is like changing a diaper later.... and now the baby has a rash sort of situation. \n\nIt's a puppy. regular walks are needed to get a trained to do it's needs outside. If this is the level of care they are going to have, they should rehome the poor puppy. \n\nI walked my pup during migraine attacks or at 5 am if i had to work early. parents should have never said yes to a dog, nvm s high energy breed that has lotts of needs.", "Calm down :)", "Omg it's once. There are other people that can do it.  It doesn't have to be one person's responsibility forever.  The dad is overreacting.  He can take the dog out once.  This is a non issue.", "\ud83d\ude2d", "Again, it's not about how big of an ask it is. Taking the dog out once is an easy task. If it's so easy tho, then OP should have just done it. Because they made the commitment to do so"]}
