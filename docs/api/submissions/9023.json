However, mine got accepted and they called me in for an audition at 9:00 AM. I have lots to do, including answer dozens of questions, perform a short monologue, read an original short story, etc.\n\nSo when my dad asked me to walk the dog less than two minutes after I woke up, I asked him if he could do it today so I could prepare for my audition in two hours. He said that only a week in and I was already betraying my dog and being a bad parent.\n\nI argued with him for a little bit, and he eventually agreed to take her for a walk, but said I was a terrible dog owner. I am now working on my audition preparation.\n\nEDIT: Yes, I had taken the dog into the backyard when she woke up to poo and pee. I did not know about the audition until the day before it was scheduled. Also I understand I am the asshole now and I apologized to my father. I have spend the last little bit pushing my audition prep time to play with/ occupy my dog and spend time with her.

A border/golden mix is typically very high energy. Walks aren't usually going to suffice alone, you need to be in puppy classes, providing socialization, and stimulating activities, otherwise you're going to have a frustrated and destructive dog. \n\nWhich all wasn't the point of your post, but I can't help it because = I'm doubtful you or your parents understand what you're getting into here.

You knew your dog would have to go out, and instead of getting up earlier or anything you just pawned it off, that\u2019s bad dog ownership. On top of that you argued for a bit, which is all time that could have been used to dog walk. I love people like yourself, I deal with them all the time at my job.

This isn't about one morning, it's about a living creature depending on you for all of its needs.

It's okay to ask for help in advance if you know you're going to need it. If I know I have somewhere I need to/want to be then I'll look for someone willing to look after my dog as soon as I know. In this case, you didn't do that. I'm sure you've known about this audition for at least a couple of days. Why didn't you ask your dad if he could effectively puppysit today as soon as you knew?

You could have rearranged your schedule accordingly and gotten up a little earlier this morning so you'd have time to care for your puppy.", "I'm gonna go with ESH, but this only happened once. If this is a weekly occurrence I would change my response. People here are too quick to judge.", "NTA.\n\nAsking a favor when you have a good reason is not \"betraying your dog and being a bad parent\".  That's ridiculous and uncalled for.  I'm not blaming your dad for making you walk the dog, mind you - you obviously could make time for that - but your dad is an asshole for not simply saying no, that was all that would have been necessary.", "YTA. That's the reality of owning a dog. I have two. Sometimes I have to get up at 4am to get them out for a good run before I have an early shift. You have to adjust your life around dog ownership, especially with high energy breeds.", "YTA - the time you took to argue with your dad and write this post, you could have walked your dog twice. I second your dad's words \"Only a week in\" and you already go back on a decade long (or hopefully longer) commitment, just because it was slightly inconvenient. Quite frankly, your parents clearly expected better from you or you wouldn't have gotten the dog. The dog deserves better.", "YTA. He's correct.

He will do treats wrapped in a towel, at least. But he even struggles with treats under cups - like \"pick the cup\" thing. \n\nHe likes things like touch, though. He thinks touch is hilarious (like, he'll do it and throw his head back so fast he'll flip his ears and will thump his tail really hard while in a sit). We're finishing up an agility beginner class, too. \n\nBut honestly? If he's bored because it's too cold outside? I just break down the obedience class homework. He loves that stuff. And it's boring at this stage - like he knows it all. But the sheets come out and he's right into it.", "Get a corgi! They'll just chase the springer!\n\n(I'm on my second generation of corgi-springer combo. It's hilarious but damn it works lol)", "They are SO mad about it and their lil coats and sweaters but they get it. They just don't like it.", "This is exactly what my cat does (yes, a cat). She doesn't give a crap about rain or snow: she wants to go for her daily walk. So, I have to get prepared and take her out so she can stalk birds and the local feral cats (but I never let her pounce). It doesn't matter how wet or cold I am, she's happy.\n\nAlso, YTA OP.", "My dogs love flash cards for cricket treats. \n\nHonestly, I worry they're getting smarter than me.", "Hahaha frisbee is so much fun. It's a classic! Gotta have good neighbour relations. We have a gate between our yards so my neighbour finally got sick of me asking and told me to just go in her yard and take stuff.", "My dog is also an aggressive fetcher. She'll run and grab, then come thwack me with it.", "Yeah as long as the temps are safe for him to walk I bundle my fat ass up and get him out and walking. We've had rescues for a long, long time and we worked with a trainer years ago who drilled into our heads that a \"tired dog is a well behaved dog\" and man, she was amazing. But we also know if he starts acting a fool it's because he hasn't been run enough. Thankfully our other two dogs are low energy, not sure I could do this x3 lol", "We have a golden as well and trust me if I could convince my other half for a third dog we would already have one \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "They don't choose to live with us. The least we can do is make their life as enjoyable as possible", "We tried the \"touch a post it note\" game...but he kept eating the post it notes, so we're not doing that game anymore LOLOL", "How does this work?!?! I think my pup would love it!!!", "My neighbour on one side is like ffs just go get it, but the other has a 120lb dog who aggressively loves. So much love. WILL ACCIDENTALLY LICK YOU TO DEATH loves. In nice weather, he sometimes stays outside for the mornings, so you just never know when he's out there and I love that dog, but lol he has SO MUCH LOVE lolol", "AWWWWWWWWW\n\nNo thwacking here! He comes running back full speed, drops near feet (we're still working on that lol), and then runs off in the direction where he wants the next throw to go. If you take too long, he starts just springing up and down. Like he was standing on a spring.\n\nDogs man. lol", "Thankfully, I have a decent back yard (for living in the city), so when it's really cold, me and the dogs can bundle and do 5-10 minute stints in the yard, go inside and do 5-10 minutes of training, then back outside for 5-10 minute. It's like cross fit for dogs LOL", "Ha! We had 1 old springer, 1 old corgi, and then got the corgi puppy. So she grew up thinking all other dogs are deaf.\n\nI'd have to shout really loud for even things like Potty! Car Ride! Because the old ones couldn't hear. So she figured that out as a pup and would make this really loud scream sound and then tug on the spaniel's ears, which got the old corgi going.\n\nYou can see where this is going.\n\nWe had not realized what that would look like when we got another spaniel puppy....\n\neeekkk lol", "Get a box of toddler flash cards. They have pictures and easy words on them like \"duck\" and \"house\" and stuff like that. Then you show them the card and say the word on it. Encourage them to touch the \"word\". So if I'm holding the duck card \"Touch duck\". When they touch it, give a treat. When they start reliably touching it, you can introduce a second word. Then when they've learned both, you can hold both cards up and get them to differentiate them. Some dogs like my labradoodle pick it up immediately. Others like my sheepdog mix get immediately bored and yell about it lol", "French Bulldog he runs gets ball then brings it back. I then spend 5mins attempting to get him to drop it so I can throw it again. If another dog owner throws a ball he will attempt to get it - when the other dog has got it he just collapses, rolls on his back wagging his legs and pretending he didn't chase the ball.\n\nLove him so much though.", "Honestly, I am loving this thread so much lol"]}
