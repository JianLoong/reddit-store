I have two children with my late wife who are 15 and 16. Claire has a grown son in his 20s. My late wife was Meggie and I still love her and always will. She passed when our kids were 2 and 3 years old. We had talked about the possibility of it happening because she had a job where she put herself at risk to help others. She is still very much part of our story. When I was ready to date again I went into it with some basic points that needed to be okay with a potential partner. Those were; I was not looking for a mother for my children, they have a mother and did not want a relationship where they called someone else mom (yes we talked about it), Meggie would always be part of the picture and any partner of mine had to be okay with that, Meggie would not be forgotten or erased just because I was ready to date. I also did not want to have more children. When Claire and I met she told me all of that was good with her because she had a grown son and did not want to start over and she respected that I still loved my late wife. She and my kids got along so I felt good about our relationship.\n\nThings were good until last year when my youngest told me Claire had been making them uncomfortable around Mother's Day and that she had requested that my child suggest a change of plans and we do something for her that Mother's Day. Claire was always with her son while the kids and I would visit Meggie's grave, go out for lunch at the diner Meggie and I took them to while she was alive and we'd chill afterward. Claire wanted us to drop that and never said a thing to me. I brought it up to her and she told me she felt it was time the kids and I joined her and her son for Mother's Day and embrace the person who is here. I told her she was celebrating with her son while my kids and I were remembering and honoring their mom. She was very closed off and I told her we needed to speak to a therapist because I could see there was more going on.\n\nIt's taken this long but from February she has been opening up and saying how she does want my kids to view her as a mother and how she isn't okay with how things are with them seeing her as family but not a parent and with how much Meggie is still part of things. She also admitted her relationship with her son is not what she has pretended it to be and how she wanted a chance to have a closer adult relationship with my kids and to be the mom of an adult she always thought she would be. I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish when they are not wanting to be part of that. She told me if I loved her I would encourage them to at least try and that I said that to her in a very dismissive way. She told me I was being rude for the sake of rude. Though the therapist agreed with me Claire is still hurt about what I said.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681454538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ln5dn/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_cannot_use_my_kids/", "score": 2310, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is: kids can have more than one kind of parent in their lives. Rather than focus on \u201cnever replacing their bio mum\u201d You could encourage the three of them to form a different kind of relationship - one where she\u2019s a trusted adult in their lives without erasing the presence of your late wife. \n\nI can tell you love your kids. I also wonder if their reluctance to embrace Claire comes from a place of not wanting to disappoint you. They were really little when Meggie died and aren\u2019t likely to remember much about her, but they instinctively understand your position on this.", "Let Claire cool off for a bit. Maybe if her relationship with her son is going through a rough patch she's just feeling super emotional and vulnerable. \n\nEither way, definitely NTA.", "NTA, she should have brought it up with you rather than making a demand of your children. Also changing a tradition like that, if not initiated by the children themselves can be quite hurtful. Put your kids first, in whatever decision they make.", "NTA", "**NTA**. Claire changed the ENTIRE dynamic without telling you, HER PARTNER.  And YOU are rude?  NOPE, changing shit midstream IS rude.", "As someone who was the kid in of your dynamic... NTA!!\n\nMy mom died when I was 3, my sister was 4 and my brother was 1. Our dad stayed single for a few years and focused on us, making sure mom was still remembered and giving us a good childhood. It was almost a decade later when he met someone he wanted to date and like you, he spoke to us first. We didn't want her to step in and fill a mom role in our lives and he supported us with that. Our feelings did not change and today we are in our 30s and she is family but she's not and has never been our parent. She is not celebrated by us on Mother's Day and we do not form a traditional nuclear family. My siblings and I are glad our dad let us define things and kept mom alive for us. It's what we would all want with our kids. I'm sorry she's no longer okay with things. But you are not wrong for sticking by what you and your kids want.\n\nMy dad told us he is still mom's widower while being his wife's husband also. It's something not everyone will understand. Normally the second spouse having kids helps with it not being such a negative. But some people really feel you need to let go of the late parent/spouse to healthily move on. But there is a way to treasure them and accept a different relationship with someone new. It's just something that requires understanding of the loss.", "NTA but Claire is very manipulative. \"If you love me, you'll...\" what? Try and force your kids to forget their mother?\nNo. Cut that shit right now. \nClaire is looking to be called \"Mom\". Please take a minute to read the reddit tales of stepparents like her. It never ends well. \nIf Claire continues to be this manipulative, kick her to the curb.", "ESH.\n\nAs much as I respect you not trying to replace your late wife in your kid's lives, sounds to me like your late wife takes way to much space in your marriage. \n\nThere are a lot more issues in your marriage than your wife and her relationship with the 3 kids.", "NTA\n\nBut you, your kids, and Claire need to understand that there is plenty of room for her in their lives without her replacing their mom. They can still be very close and have a nurturing (mutually beneficial) relationship without her being, or replacing their late mom.", "Let's look at it from your wife's perspective\n\nI assume her son does not live with you and therefore she is surrounded by a 'family' who do not want to completely let her in. Add to that her relationship with her son is not good so she's feeling isolated and an outsider\n\nShe might also be looking at the reverence you hold your late wife in. Jealously would be natural\n\nI can appreciate she wants to feel closer to all of you but she can't transfer her failing relationship with her son to be replaced by your kids\n\nEqually she needs to see she is going to be let into the fold a bit more\n\nFor instance do you plan to visit her grave on mother's day in ten years time when your kids have flown the nest? Will you be insisting you all get together for her birthday every year forever more?\n\nI suppose my main question is are you doing this for the kids or yourself? Are you truly over your late wife\n\nSoft ESH - even though your wife knew the rules she is crying out for more and you need to give her something before you ruin the relationship forever", "It seems like a discussion with the whole family would be useful if it is possible in a calm way. Ignoring the Mother's Day issue for now, looking to the future. \n\nClaire should explain to the teenagers that she would like to take a more active role in their lives, that she understands that having only got to know them when they had reached a double digit age, she can't be their mother, but wants to be more than just an adult who lives in the same house. \n\nAt 15 & 16 they are old enough to suggest what they feel comfortable accepting, and what they actively want. Hopefully Claire can let Mother's Day be for Meggie, but you all do something bonding together the day before or after.", "NAH, but it's time to look into some counseling. If you can accept that loving another woman isn't cheating on your wife, you have to accept that her raising your kids isn't making them cheat on their mother. \n\nWhat type of person was Meggie? Would she have demanded that no one else should ever help with raising her kids, or would she have been delighted to know that someone else cared for her children, even if it isn't as much as she did? \n\nBecause at the end of the day, you should be celebrating life. There's no reason you can't visit the gravesite a day before or after. But don't make another person miserable trying to keep your wife happy.", "Okay. \n\nNTA for having the boundary you set at the beginning of the relationship. \n\nNTA for choosing to do your own private thing every Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nNTA for declining to do what Claire wants (though I\u2019m sure it is painful for her).\n\nYTA for saying that Claire was using your kids to fulfill her \u201cwish\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not a wish. Your wife, for whatever reason, has a poor relationship with her son, and that sucks; there goes the last of her \u201ctraditional\u201d family unit. She\u2019s probably feeling alone and wants to feel like she\u2019s part of some sort of a family again. So it\u2019s not really a wish; it\u2019s a need of hers. And she\u2019s not \u201cusing\u201d anyone, so much as making a bid for connection.\n\nSo yeah, demoting her needs into a wish, and suggesting she would use your kids to grant it, was probably hurtful. \n\nGranted, her problem is 100% hers to deal with, and you set fair boundaries at the beginning. You don\u2019t have to concede, or force the kids to do something different. In fact you should not. \n\nIMO, make time for the diner and visit Maggie, and also make time for a nice dinner/evening with Claire. See if you can come to an agreement as a family where everyone\u2019s feelings are heard, and needs can be best met.", "ESH  \n\n\nThe relationship between your kids and your wife is for the kids to decide, it is great that Claire wants to be part of their lives, love them and take care of them, that means your kids have someone they can count on and can have a female role model on their lives that is willing to be a positive influence for them, and that means more for them.  \n\n\nBut the kids are to decide how to relate to her and to call her whatever they choose, their Claire, their mom, their stepmom or however they want to incorporate her in a loving way, but it is not something to be forced upon. Kids do need a motherly figure as much as a fatherly figure for a healthy development, if they don't find it on their home, they will find external role models in other places. Claire should be free to relate to your kids as how she wants too, if she wants to be a part to their lives as a motherly figure.\n\nI believe there is more work to do in your family, you are still grieving and maybe in a not so healthy way, it seems to me you carry a big weight that you don't wanna let go, even if you made the effort of moving on and that is ok, it can be a long process, but sometimes we need help to get through it.   \n\n\nThe people we spend our life with will always accompany us, they have left an indelible mark on us, but if their memory disables us from having new healthy relationships and living a satisfying life, then we aren't honoring them as they would wish for us to lead a happy life.  \n\n\nMore than agreeing or disagreeing with any of you both, I would suggest to still go to therapy and possibly try another therapist, one with experience with grief and couple therapy if possible.  \n\n\nI suggest watching this episode of Cinematherapy talking specifically about Co-Parenting, I love this channel and their teachings, I really recommend giving a watch to some of their videos!  \n\n\n[Therapist Reacts: Co-Parenting in KUNG FU PANDA 2 and 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x3iFyL2hf8)", "NTA for setting boundaries. Especially as you have always been clear with her. And she is totally TA for trying to go through your children like this. \n\nBut you sound very dismissive of your wife\u2019s needs and that makes me wonder WHY she felt she couldn\u2019t come to you and tell you that she wanted and needed something different in this family structure. \n\nMother\u2019s Day is about recognition. How long has she functionally been doing the work of a parent in your household without appreciation or recognition?  Is part of what she needs is a Mother\u2019s Day type of tradition that celebrates her role? Call it whatever you want- but it might really help. \n\nIf it has been years- well- relationships naturally evolve. And I wonder how much of your kid\u2019s reluctance to be closer to her is because you are reminding them that she\u2019s not their mom and they don\u2019t want to disappoint you or be disloyal to Meggie by letting Claire in more deeply. I might be totally off base- teenagers will be teenagers and they might keep her at a distance for any number of reasons- but if this resonates- you might want to bring that to your therapist.", "NTA for most of it\nBut YTA when you said: \"I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish\". From what i can understand she dosen't have the best relationship with her son, atleast from her POV. And she's trying to be a mother figure to your kids, so ig she's just feeling left out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So, yeah, they've always wanted to do it the way you expected them to, because that's how you taught them.

Claire wanted us to drop that and never said a thing to me.\n\nYeah, because she's being a manipulative asshole. She said nothing to you, because she knew exactly where you stood, but if she could cajole your kids into saying it's them and not her... it's a disgustingly deceptive trick and only a creep does that.

Claire married you, hoping that she could have a do-over relationship with your kids, because she's mad she wasn't a good mother the first time, and now she's trying to manipulate you and your kids into going with what she wants? Cuz, that's how this reads. She wanted to take a back alley route to what she wanted when you were clear about what you wanted from the start.

I don't understand how a marriage can be strong under these conditions. \n\nClaire absolutely needs to respect that she shares space with Meggie. She knew what she was getting into and has to be willing to accept that Mother's Day will never be about her, but respect for your partner in a mother-type role for your kids may go a long way.\n\nBut she may also be feeling resentment because she is having to share SO MUCH space with Meggie.

It was dis respectful to say the least, deceitful in reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more disturbing is that this came on as she accepted the fact that her relationship with her son was not as solid as it once was, or as she thought.  In making that realization she just arbitrarily decided that your kids would make good surrogates for her attention, emotional, and social needs.  And she expected this with some immediacy.   That is an extreme red flag for socio-emotional issues.  Perhaps she needs that therapist all by her lonesome for a while.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Clair may feel hurt, one has to consider why she feels hurt.

Are you splitting all household costs 50-50 or is Claire only paying  25% of everything? If she is providing half of the cost for bills that is taking a parental role and supporting your children and you are not giving her credit for that. Have you thought of a possibility of giving Claire a special endearment term for the children to call her instead of claire, this might help her feel more included in the family.\n\nEdit to clarify: I say possible agenda because you are not over your late wife and I don't think you wanted to be lonely.

I think Claire was 110% wrong to do what she did, but I do get where her feeling came from, and they are valid. You are attempting to make sure Claire is not a mom to your kids. However, you are also holding her back greatly from having her own special and unique role. A stepmom does not replace a mom. A stepmom does not lessen a mom. Calling a stepmom an auntie and refusing to let her naturally build some small paternal role with your kids has cheapened her whole experience. \n\nPerhaps you could both quit acting like children yourselves and realize who the Ahole is doesn't matter.

Meggie is up on a pedestal while Claire just wants some recognition. \n\nThis is where compromise and compassion on all fronts will be make or break. In your family, Mother\u2019s Day is Meggie\u2019s day- that\u2019s fair. So maybe you all create your own \u201cClaire\u2019s day\u201d holiday where you show her how much she\u2019s loved and appreciated. \n\nMoms come in all forms whether we refer to them as such or not. Moms are people who love, care for, and support us and always look out for our wellbeing. That\u2019s what you and the kids have. You don\u2019t have to forget about or stop loving Meggie to acknowledge that. Many are not so lucky and end up stuck with a new partner who resents the kids or treats them differently from their own.", "Claire didn't approach you with any of this. She went straight to your kids and then a therapist. And *that* didn't turn out the way she expected. \n\nYou learned she was never happy with the arrangement she agreed to.  Any red flags for you?\n\nNTA", "INFO.  You don't say when she came into your girls life. That is key to input.  If they were young, you probably did everyone a disservice as it sounds like you weren't ready to marry.  If the were over ten, then Claire's expectations are more unreasonable.", "This exactly.  These kids were robbed of a normal natural motherly-type relationship with Claire because their father was so militant about their dead mother being the \u2018only\u2019 mother and it\u2019s sad.  These kids are old enough to talk to Claire directly without their dad getting involved.", "The fact that she seemed to try and maneuver around OP and present it straight to the kids makes me think she knew this wasn't ok. \n\nIts the trying to make demands or that the kids \"try\" to do this for her. If she simply issued an invitation and waited for them to warm up to the idea and come around, that's one thing. Her being sneaky, and then trying to get OP to compel the kids to do what she wants is what's wrong in my eyes. Trying to force it NEVER works out well.", "Yep, yep, yep aaaaand... Yep!\n\nEspecially this bit:\n\n>you are basically worshiping her and you forced your kids to do so as well. \n\nThey were so young when she died that I doubt of they have many real memories of her... The version of \"mum\" that they know, is the one created for them by OP. I'm not sure that's healthy to the degree OP has been forcing this \"i won't forget her or move on\" type attitude. \n\n>They were young when she died and while she played a significant role in their life your children have their entire life ahead of them and they need parental figure\n\nAgain absolutely. \n\nMeggie isn't here, Claire is. And she's happy to step into the role of OP would let her. \n\nStepping into a role doesn't mean completely forgetting Meggie. \n\nOP, with the best meaning, YTA. Or is \"you're kinda the asshole\" an option? You're forcing your kids to be locked into the past. They live in the now.", "Yep this is exactly why I would never date a guy with kids!

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unfair because OP clearly communicated at the beginning of the relationship he was looking for a romantic partner, not a new mother for his children. And again, visiting his dead wife\u2019s grave on Mother\u2019s Day seems very reasonable, wouldn\u2019t really call that worshipping. He\u2019s treating his wife like his wife, and not the children\u2019s mother, because she\u2019s not the children\u2019s mother.

Unfortunately for the teenagers they\u2019ve not had their biological mom for most of their lives, but it seems like their dad has prevented them from being able to be open to additional parental figures at all. From his comments, OP says Claire does literally nothing for the kids in terms of helping around the house/with parenting, and not much with them in terms of fun stuff either. \n\nI\u2019d love to get the kids\u2019 perspectives on how they feel about the worship of their bio mom.", "Exactly! It seems like Claire will always be living in Meggie\u2019s shadow. I honestly would not be able to stay in a marriage where 1.) there is basically a shrine for the late wife, 2.) I don\u2019t get to have any parental role while still having to deal with the kids, 3.) I just overall feel like I am never going to be anyone\u2019s first choice. \n\nThis must feel like such a lonely existence for Claire. I don\u2019t like recommending divorce at all, but I feel like Claire needs to find someone who will truly value and love her.", "You whole perspective seems wrong to me. Since when does handing someone a title equate to completely letting them in? \n\nNot all family is blood and not all blood is family. The same goes for titles. Not all family needs a title and not everyone with a title is family. If Claire needs a title to feel let in then she is more concerned with public perception than actually building her own unique bond with the children.", "Idk, other comments say \"feelings change\" and yes they do, but not inevitably and it seems the kids' feelings haven't as the youngest immediately told dad when something is off. So because Claire's feelings have changed everyone else needs to go to therapy and reevaluate their own feelings, because \"feelings change\"?  \n\nHe says in comments that Claire and his kids spend time together alone and then telling him almost immediately indicates that they feel comfortable talking to him about things that make them uncomfortable. Also, based on his immediate request for therapy, he seems to be open to it as a solution for his girls as well. Also, it doesn't even sound like they do something Mom-centric often. \n\nI just don't get why people are bending over backwards to make OP out to be even partially the AH.

Children of all types of families benefit from having maternal and paternal figures and because your wife passed she could not be that for them.

Of course nobody can replace your biological mom but do you have space for like a grown support parent ? I mean if I spend like 20 years with a guy I kind of wished the kids would kind of see me as part of their family , not replacing anybody but at this point I would spend more years around them so there sould be a different kind of bond . I get the whole no replacing their mom but what kind of space could she have in your life . it would feel odd to be a stranger to the kids at all events", "No one saying they don\u2019t have a mom but she hasn\u2019t been in their life to actually parent them. She\u2019s not able to help shape them as they grow up and that is just the fact of it. I think it\u2019s wonderful OP wants the children to know and be connected to their mom but he\u2019s done that with the idea that anyone else coming in to help support them is at risk of taking over her spot, which nobody can ever do", "Absolutely complicated", "This so much.   Those kids were 2 and 3 when their Mom died.   Their relationship was dependent on how their dad assigned it to Claire.   And that\u2019s been fine, but emotions are so complicated.   \n\nNAH.", "Rule #9. No asking for advice. \n\nIt's literally against the rules to ask for advice. He didn't ask for advice.", "Did he ask for advice or to be told whether he was an asshole?", "For some of us it's juts not something we want or feel like we are missing from our lives. And we didn't like the idea that just because he was marrying again, she would be our parent. Family, yes, but to me those are different things. Not all kids will feel that way. Some long for someone else to fill that second parent role for them. It is possible to not long for that like with us.\n\nI think a different day if they want to celebrate being a family could work. But if they want Mother's Day for their mom, I know how that feels.", "His kids were only like 11 and 12 when he got married. So probably not too much younger when he started dating. That's old enough to have their own opinions.", "I feel as though you're the one jumping to conclusions, here, not the person you're replying to. \"Aggressive rigidity\" is showcased nowhere in this post or comments, that's something you've made up entirely.", "Exactly, the only sane thing the wife could do at this point is leave and find someone that does not treat her like a part of the furniture.\n\nI remember I read another reddit post about a man who lost his wife and the mother of his young children. He met a woman, got married, then he and wife and the kids would go to the late wife's grave together to honour the mother of the children. Wife was happy to keep the memory of the mother (went as so far to make sure the kids remembered their mother's birthday etc) she was treated as part of the husband's and the kids lives. Because, you know, that is actually what a family does. OPs wife is excluded from such events.", "That's weird.", "Then there\u2019s a bigger \ud83d\udea9here: she unapologetically baited and switched you into marriage. Claire has now repeatedly lied to you to get what she wants, regardless of your needs. You made it clear that you didn\u2019t want a replacement mom for your kids when you were dating. Those were your boundaries. Whoever didn\u2019t respect them wasn\u2019t going to have you. Yet, instead of asking to talk about them, she pretended she was okay with that to continue your relationship. She did that because she wanted to keep you on her terms, not your terms. She lied about her relationship with her son. She tried to use your kids to her around what you agreed to. Claire doesn\u2019t seem to respect your boundaries, and puts her own needs before yours and your kids. That\u2019s not mom material; that\u2019s the a bad stepmother stereotype."]}
