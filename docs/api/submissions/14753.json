I have two children with my late wife who are 15 and 16. Claire has a grown son in his 20s. My late wife was Meggie and I still love her and always will. She passed when our kids were 2 and 3 years old. We had talked about the possibility of it happening because she had a job where she put herself at risk to help others. She is still very much part of our story. When I was ready to date again I went into it with some basic points that needed to be okay with a potential partner. Those were; I was not looking for a mother for my children, they have a mother and did not want a relationship where they called someone else mom (yes we talked about it), Meggie would always be part of the picture and any partner of mine had to be okay with that, Meggie would not be forgotten or erased just because I was ready to date. I also did not want to have more children. When Claire and I met she told me all of that was good with her because she had a grown son and did not want to start over and she respected that I still loved my late wife. She and my kids got along so I felt good about our relationship.\n\nThings were good until last year when my youngest told me Claire had been making them uncomfortable around Mother's Day and that she had requested that my child suggest a change of plans and we do something for her that Mother's Day. Claire was always with her son while the kids and I would visit Meggie's grave, go out for lunch at the diner Meggie and I took them to while she was alive and we'd chill afterward. Claire wanted us to drop that and never said a thing to me. I brought it up to her and she told me she felt it was time the kids and I joined her and her son for Mother's Day and embrace the person who is here. I told her she was celebrating with her son while my kids and I were remembering and honoring their mom. She was very closed off and I told her we needed to speak to a therapist because I could see there was more going on.\n\nIt's taken this long but from February she has been opening up and saying how she does want my kids to view her as a mother and how she isn't okay with how things are with them seeing her as family but not a parent and with how much Meggie is still part of things. She also admitted her relationship with her son is not what she has pretended it to be and how she wanted a chance to have a closer adult relationship with my kids and to be the mom of an adult she always thought she would be. I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish when they are not wanting to be part of that. She told me if I loved her I would encourage them to at least try and that I said that to her in a very dismissive way. She told me I was being rude for the sake of rude.

The thing is: kids can have more than one kind of parent in their lives. Rather than focus on \u201cnever replacing their bio mum\u201d You could encourage the three of them to form a different kind of relationship - one where she\u2019s a trusted adult in their lives without erasing the presence of your late wife. \n\nI can tell you love your kids. I also wonder if their reluctance to embrace Claire comes from a place of not wanting to disappoint you. They were really little when Meggie died and aren\u2019t likely to remember much about her, but they instinctively understand your position on this.", "Let Claire cool off for a bit. Maybe if her relationship with her son is going through a rough patch she's just feeling super emotional and vulnerable. \n\nEither way, definitely NTA.", "NTA, she should have brought it up with you rather than making a demand of your children. Also changing a tradition like that, if not initiated by the children themselves can be quite hurtful. Put your kids first, in whatever decision they make.", "NTA", "**NTA**. Claire changed the ENTIRE dynamic without telling you, HER PARTNER.  And YOU are rude?  NOPE, changing shit midstream IS rude.", "As someone who was the kid in of your dynamic... NTA!!\n\nMy mom died when I was 3, my sister was 4 and my brother was 1. Our dad stayed single for a few years and focused on us, making sure mom was still remembered and giving us a good childhood. It was almost a decade later when he met someone he wanted to date and like you, he spoke to us first. We didn't want her to step in and fill a mom role in our lives and he supported us with that. Our feelings did not change and today we are in our 30s and she is family but she's not and has never been our parent. She is not celebrated by us on Mother's Day and we do not form a traditional nuclear family. My siblings and I are glad our dad let us define things and kept mom alive for us. It's what we would all want with our kids. I'm sorry she's no longer okay with things. But you are not wrong for sticking by what you and your kids want.\n\nMy dad told us he is still mom's widower while being his wife's husband also. It's something not everyone will understand. Normally the second spouse having kids helps with it not being such a negative. But some people really feel you need to let go of the late parent/spouse to healthily move on. But there is a way to treasure them and accept a different relationship with someone new. It's just something that requires understanding of the loss.", "NTA but Claire is very manipulative. \"If you love me, you'll...\" what? Try and force your kids to forget their mother?\nNo. Cut that shit right now. \nClaire is looking to be called \"Mom\". Please take a minute to read the reddit tales of stepparents like her. It never ends well. \nIf Claire continues to be this manipulative, kick her to the curb.", "ESH.\n\nAs much as I respect you not trying to replace your late wife in your kid's lives, sounds to me like your late wife takes way to much space in your marriage. \n\nThere are a lot more issues in your marriage than your wife and her relationship with the 3 kids.", "NTA\n\nBut you, your kids, and Claire need to understand that there is plenty of room for her in their lives without her replacing their mom. They can still be very close and have a nurturing (mutually beneficial) relationship without her being, or replacing their late mom.", "Let's look at it from your wife's perspective\n\nI assume her son does not live with you and therefore she is surrounded by a 'family' who do not want to completely let her in. Add to that her relationship with her son is not good so she's feeling isolated and an outsider\n\nShe might also be looking at the reverence you hold your late wife in. Jealously would be natural\n\nI can appreciate she wants to feel closer to all of you but she can't transfer her failing relationship with her son to be replaced by your kids\n\nEqually she needs to see she is going to be let into the fold a bit more\n\nFor instance do you plan to visit her grave on mother's day in ten years time when your kids have flown the nest? Will you be insisting you all get together for her birthday every year forever more?\n\nI suppose my main question is are you doing this for the kids or yourself? Are you truly over your late wife\n\nSoft ESH - even though your wife knew the rules she is crying out for more and you need to give her something before you ruin the relationship forever", "It seems like a discussion with the whole family would be useful if it is possible in a calm way. Ignoring the Mother's Day issue for now, looking to the future. \n\nClaire should explain to the teenagers that she would like to take a more active role in their lives, that she understands that having only got to know them when they had reached a double digit age, she can't be their mother, but wants to be more than just an adult who lives in the same house. \n\nAt 15 & 16 they are old enough to suggest what they feel comfortable accepting, and what they actively want. Hopefully Claire can let Mother's Day be for Meggie, but you all do something bonding together the day before or after.", "NAH, but it's time to look into some counseling. If you can accept that loving another woman isn't cheating on your wife, you have to accept that her raising your kids isn't making them cheat on their mother. \n\nWhat type of person was Meggie? Would she have demanded that no one else should ever help with raising her kids, or would she have been delighted to know that someone else cared for her children, even if it isn't as much as she did? \n\nBecause at the end of the day, you should be celebrating life. There's no reason you can't visit the gravesite a day before or after. But don't make another person miserable trying to keep your wife happy.", "Okay. \n\nNTA for having the boundary you set at the beginning of the relationship. \n\nNTA for choosing to do your own private thing every Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nNTA for declining to do what Claire wants (though I\u2019m sure it is painful for her).\n\nYTA for saying that Claire was using your kids to fulfill her \u201cwish\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not a wish. Your wife, for whatever reason, has a poor relationship with her son, and that sucks; there goes the last of her \u201ctraditional\u201d family unit. She\u2019s probably feeling alone and wants to feel like she\u2019s part of some sort of a family again. So it\u2019s not really a wish; it\u2019s a need of hers. And she\u2019s not \u201cusing\u201d anyone, so much as making a bid for connection.\n\nSo yeah, demoting her needs into a wish, and suggesting she would use your kids to grant it, was probably hurtful. \n\nGranted, her problem is 100% hers to deal with, and you set fair boundaries at the beginning. You don\u2019t have to concede, or force the kids to do something different. In fact you should not. \n\nIMO, make time for the diner and visit Maggie, and also make time for a nice dinner/evening with Claire. See if you can come to an agreement as a family where everyone\u2019s feelings are heard, and needs can be best met.", "ESH  \n\n\nThe relationship between your kids and your wife is for the kids to decide, it is great that Claire wants to be part of their lives, love them and take care of them, that means your kids have someone they can count on and can have a female role model on their lives that is willing to be a positive influence for them, and that means more for them.  \n\n\nBut the kids are to decide how to relate to her and to call her whatever they choose, their Claire, their mom, their stepmom or however they want to incorporate her in a loving way, but it is not something to be forced upon. Kids do need a motherly figure as much as a fatherly figure for a healthy development, if they don't find it on their home, they will find external role models in other places. Claire should be free to relate to your kids as how she wants too, if she wants to be a part to their lives as a motherly figure.\n\nI believe there is more work to do in your family, you are still grieving and maybe in a not so healthy way, it seems to me you carry a big weight that you don't wanna let go, even if you made the effort of moving on and that is ok, it can be a long process, but sometimes we need help to get through it.   \n\n\nThe people we spend our life with will always accompany us, they have left an indelible mark on us, but if their memory disables us from having new healthy relationships and living a satisfying life, then we aren't honoring them as they would wish for us to lead a happy life.  \n\n\nMore than agreeing or disagreeing with any of you both, I would suggest to still go to therapy and possibly try another therapist, one with experience with grief and couple therapy if possible.  \n\n\nI suggest watching this episode of Cinematherapy talking specifically about Co-Parenting, I love this channel and their teachings, I really recommend giving a watch to some of their videos!  \n\n\n[Therapist Reacts: Co-Parenting in KUNG FU PANDA 2 and 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x3iFyL2hf8)", "NTA for setting boundaries. Especially as you have always been clear with her. And she is totally TA for trying to go through your children like this. \n\nBut you sound very dismissive of your wife\u2019s needs and that makes me wonder WHY she felt she couldn\u2019t come to you and tell you that she wanted and needed something different in this family structure. \n\nMother\u2019s Day is about recognition. How long has she functionally been doing the work of a parent in your household without appreciation or recognition?  Is part of what she needs is a Mother\u2019s Day type of tradition that celebrates her role? Call it whatever you want- but it might really help. \n\nIf it has been years- well- relationships naturally evolve. And I wonder how much of your kid\u2019s reluctance to be closer to her is because you are reminding them that she\u2019s not their mom and they don\u2019t want to disappoint you or be disloyal to Meggie by letting Claire in more deeply. I might be totally off base- teenagers will be teenagers and they might keep her at a distance for any number of reasons- but if this resonates- you might want to bring that to your therapist.", "NTA for most of it\nBut YTA when you said: \"I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish\". From what i can understand she dosen't have the best relationship with her son, atleast from her POV. And she's trying to be a mother figure to your kids, so ig she's just feeling left out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I don't think it should be forced, especially on the kids, to expect to let her be a parent to them after everything.", "Then ask yourself why she felt she couldn't tell you the truth or why she felt like she had to go behind your back to talk about plans for Mother's Day.\n\nI'm not saying your wife is an angel. That's why I went with ESH. Going behind your back and trying to use your kid as surrogates because her relationship with her son does not held up to her expectations is shitty. But this must not be easy for her either. She lives with people who love each other, with kids who worship their dead mother and she gets nothing. Nothing from her son. Nothing from her stepkids. Nothing from her husband who is still very much in love with his late wife. \n\nThis is not working for her anymore."]}
