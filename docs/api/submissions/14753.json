I have two children with my late wife who are 15 and 16. Claire has a grown son in his 20s. My late wife was Meggie and I still love her and always will. She passed when our kids were 2 and 3 years old. We had talked about the possibility of it happening because she had a job where she put herself at risk to help others. She is still very much part of our story. When I was ready to date again I went into it with some basic points that needed to be okay with a potential partner. Those were; I was not looking for a mother for my children, they have a mother and did not want a relationship where they called someone else mom (yes we talked about it), Meggie would always be part of the picture and any partner of mine had to be okay with that, Meggie would not be forgotten or erased just because I was ready to date. I also did not want to have more children. When Claire and I met she told me all of that was good with her because she had a grown son and did not want to start over and she respected that I still loved my late wife. She and my kids got along so I felt good about our relationship.\n\nThings were good until last year when my youngest told me Claire had been making them uncomfortable around Mother's Day and that she had requested that my child suggest a change of plans and we do something for her that Mother's Day. Claire was always with her son while the kids and I would visit Meggie's grave, go out for lunch at the diner Meggie and I took them to while she was alive and we'd chill afterward. Claire wanted us to drop that and never said a thing to me. I brought it up to her and she told me she felt it was time the kids and I joined her and her son for Mother's Day and embrace the person who is here. I told her she was celebrating with her son while my kids and I were remembering and honoring their mom. She was very closed off and I told her we needed to speak to a therapist because I could see there was more going on.\n\nIt's taken this long but from February she has been opening up and saying how she does want my kids to view her as a mother and how she isn't okay with how things are with them seeing her as family but not a parent and with how much Meggie is still part of things. She also admitted her relationship with her son is not what she has pretended it to be and how she wanted a chance to have a closer adult relationship with my kids and to be the mom of an adult she always thought she would be. I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish when they are not wanting to be part of that. She told me if I loved her I would encourage them to at least try and that I said that to her in a very dismissive way. She told me I was being rude for the sake of rude. Though the therapist agreed with me Claire is still hurt about what I said.\n\nAITA?\n\nETA: I remarried 4 years ago. My kids have known her 5 years. When we discussed what Claire's role would be and the fact she would not be a mother to my children, she wanted it to be clear that she didn't want to do all the work for none of the motherly benefits. So we agreed I would parent and she would enjoy a relationship with the kids. It might be more strict than some would say is normal and I will acknowledge that. But we did communicate about this a lot before we married and when we were still figuring out things. This was fine at first. But then her relationship with her son deteriorated. She lied about that to me for at least a year. Then it became a problem that we had agreed she would not be a mother to my children. Because she wanted that stronger adult relationship and was not going to have that with her son.", "created_utc": 1681454538, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ln5dn/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_cannot_use_my_kids/", "score": 6901, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing is: kids can have more than one kind of parent in their lives. Rather than focus on \u201cnever replacing their bio mum\u201d You could encourage the three of them to form a different kind of relationship - one where she\u2019s a trusted adult in their lives without erasing the presence of your late wife. \n\nI can tell you love your kids. I also wonder if their reluctance to embrace Claire comes from a place of not wanting to disappoint you. They were really little when Meggie died and aren\u2019t likely to remember much about her, but they instinctively understand your position on this.", "Let Claire cool off for a bit. Maybe if her relationship with her son is going through a rough patch she's just feeling super emotional and vulnerable. \n\nEither way, definitely NTA.", "NTA, she should have brought it up with you rather than making a demand of your children. Also changing a tradition like that, if not initiated by the children themselves can be quite hurtful. Put your kids first, in whatever decision they make.", "NTA", "**NTA**. Claire changed the ENTIRE dynamic without telling you, HER PARTNER.  And YOU are rude?  NOPE, changing shit midstream IS rude.", "As someone who was the kid in of your dynamic... NTA!!\n\nMy mom died when I was 3, my sister was 4 and my brother was 1. Our dad stayed single for a few years and focused on us, making sure mom was still remembered and giving us a good childhood. It was almost a decade later when he met someone he wanted to date and like you, he spoke to us first. We didn't want her to step in and fill a mom role in our lives and he supported us with that. Our feelings did not change and today we are in our 30s and she is family but she's not and has never been our parent. She is not celebrated by us on Mother's Day and we do not form a traditional nuclear family. My siblings and I are glad our dad let us define things and kept mom alive for us. It's what we would all want with our kids. I'm sorry she's no longer okay with things. But you are not wrong for sticking by what you and your kids want.\n\nMy dad told us he is still mom's widower while being his wife's husband also. It's something not everyone will understand. Normally the second spouse having kids helps with it not being such a negative. But some people really feel you need to let go of the late parent/spouse to healthily move on. But there is a way to treasure them and accept a different relationship with someone new. It's just something that requires understanding of the loss.", "NTA but Claire is very manipulative. \"If you love me, you'll...\" what?

They can still be very close and have a nurturing (mutually beneficial) relationship without her being, or replacing their late mom.", "Let's look at it from your wife's perspective\n\nI assume her son does not live with you and therefore she is surrounded by a 'family' who do not want to completely let her in.

Jealously would be natural\n\nI can appreciate she wants to feel closer to all of you but she can't transfer her failing relationship with her son to be replaced by your kids\n\nEqually she needs to see she is going to be let into the fold a bit more\n\nFor instance do you plan to visit her grave on mother's day in ten years time when your kids have flown the nest? Will you be insisting you all get together for her birthday every year forever more?\n\nI suppose my main question is are you doing this for the kids or yourself?

Hopefully Claire can let Mother's Day be for Meggie, but you all do something bonding together the day before or after.", "NAH, but it's time to look into some counseling. If you can accept that loving another woman isn't cheating on your wife, you have to accept that her raising your kids isn't making them cheat on their mother. \n\nWhat type of person was Meggie? Would she have demanded that no one else should ever help with raising her kids, or would she have been delighted to know that someone else cared for her children, even if it isn't as much as she did? \n\nBecause at the end of the day, you should be celebrating life. There's no reason you can't visit the gravesite a day before or after. But don't make another person miserable trying to keep your wife happy.", "Okay. \n\nNTA for having the boundary you set at the beginning of the relationship. \n\nNTA for choosing to do your own private thing every Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nNTA for declining to do what Claire wants (though I\u2019m sure it is painful for her).\n\nYTA for saying that Claire was using your kids to fulfill her \u201cwish\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not a wish. Your wife, for whatever reason, has a poor relationship with her son, and that sucks; there goes the last of her \u201ctraditional\u201d family unit. She\u2019s probably feeling alone and wants to feel like she\u2019s part of some sort of a family again. So it\u2019s not really a wish; it\u2019s a need of hers. And she\u2019s not \u201cusing\u201d anyone, so much as making a bid for connection.\n\nSo yeah, demoting her needs into a wish, and suggesting she would use your kids to grant it, was probably hurtful. \n\nGranted, her problem is 100% hers to deal with, and you set fair boundaries at the beginning. You don\u2019t have to concede, or force the kids to do something different. In fact you should not. \n\nIMO, make time for the diner and visit Maggie, and also make time for a nice dinner/evening with Claire. See if you can come to an agreement as a family where everyone\u2019s feelings are heard, and needs can be best met.", "ESH  \n\n\nThe relationship between your kids and your wife is for the kids to decide, it is great that Claire wants to be part of their lives, love them and take care of them, that means your kids have someone they can count on and can have a female role model on their lives that is willing to be a positive influence for them, and that means more for them.  \n\n\nBut the kids are to decide how to relate to her and to call her whatever they choose, their Claire, their mom, their stepmom or however they want to incorporate her in a loving way, but it is not something to be forced upon. Kids do need a motherly figure as much as a fatherly figure for a healthy development, if they don't find it on their home, they will find external role models in other places. Claire should be free to relate to your kids as how she wants too, if she wants to be a part to their lives as a motherly figure.\n\nI believe there is more work to do in your family, you are still grieving and maybe in a not so healthy way, it seems to me you carry a big weight that you don't wanna let go, even if you made the effort of moving on and that is ok, it can be a long process, but sometimes we need help to get through it.   \n\n\nThe people we spend our life with will always accompany us, they have left an indelible mark on us, but if their memory disables us from having new healthy relationships and living a satisfying life, then we aren't honoring them as they would wish for us to lead a happy life.  \n\n\nMore than agreeing or disagreeing with any of you both, I would suggest to still go to therapy and possibly try another therapist, one with experience with grief and couple therapy if possible.  \n\n\nI suggest watching this episode of Cinematherapy talking specifically about Co-Parenting, I love this channel and their teachings, I really recommend giving a watch to some of their videos!  \n\n\n[Therapist Reacts: Co-Parenting in KUNG FU PANDA 2 and 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x3iFyL2hf8)", "NTA for setting boundaries. Especially as you have always been clear with her. And she is totally TA for trying to go through your children like this. \n\nBut you sound very dismissive of your wife\u2019s needs and that makes me wonder WHY she felt she couldn\u2019t come to you and tell you that she wanted and needed something different in this family structure. \n\nMother\u2019s Day is about recognition. How long has she functionally been doing the work of a parent in your household without appreciation or recognition?  Is part of what she needs is a Mother\u2019s Day type of tradition that celebrates her role? Call it whatever you want- but it might really help. \n\nIf it has been years- well- relationships naturally evolve. And I wonder how much of your kid\u2019s reluctance to be closer to her is because you are reminding them that she\u2019s not their mom and they don\u2019t want to disappoint you or be disloyal to Meggie by letting Claire in more deeply. I might be totally off base- teenagers will be teenagers and they might keep her at a distance for any number of reasons- but if this resonates- you might want to bring that to your therapist.", "NTA for most of it\nBut YTA when you said: \"I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish\". From what i can understand she dosen't have the best relationship with her son, atleast from her POV. And she's trying to be a mother figure to your kids, so ig she's just feeling left out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So, yeah, they've always wanted to do it the way you expected them to, because that's how you taught them.

Claire wanted us to drop that and never said a thing to me.\n\nYeah, because she's being a manipulative asshole. She said nothing to you, because she knew exactly where you stood, but if she could cajole your kids into saying it's them and not her... it's a disgustingly deceptive trick and only a creep does that. A child won't know better, and you're lucky your kid was forthcoming about how creepy she was being.\n\n> I brought it up to her and she told me she felt it was time the kids and I joined her and her son for Mother's Day and embrace the person who is here\n\nSo she basically was just waiting until she personally felt enough time had passed where you were too married to her to simply say no...because that's what this looks like.

She told me I was being rude for the sake of rude. Though the therapist agreed with me Claire is still hurt about what I said.\n\nSo to be clear. Claire married you, hoping that she could have a do-over relationship with your kids, because she's mad she wasn't a good mother the first time, and now she's trying to manipulate you and your kids into going with what she wants? Cuz, that's how this reads. She wanted to take a back alley route to what she wanted when you were clear about what you wanted from the start.

I don't understand how a marriage can be strong under these conditions. \n\nClaire absolutely needs to respect that she shares space with Meggie. She knew what she was getting into and has to be willing to accept that Mother's Day will never be about her, but respect for your partner in a mother-type role for your kids may go a long way.\n\nBut she may also be feeling resentment because she is having to share SO MUCH space with Meggie.

She told me if I loved her I would encourage them to at least try and that I said that to her in a very dismissive way.\n\nAha! The mask is finally peeling off. \n\nYour wife hid who she is until she was safely ensconced in your family.

That was part of the foundation of your relationship, so she can't go destroying that and think the relationship will persist. \n\nBTW: You are a supah-awesome dad for prioritizing your daughters' well being and also honoring their memories of their mom.

Anyone joining your circle knew the rules in place coming in, and should have known if they could accept and respect them coming in.  Further, it is rather underhanded of Clair to try to make an end run around you by going to  your children to try to force the change without first coming to you.  It was dis respectful to say the least, deceitful in reality.\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more disturbing is that this came on as she accepted the fact that her relationship with her son was not as solid as it once was, or as she thought.  In making that realization she just arbitrarily decided that your kids would make good surrogates for her attention, emotional, and social needs.  And she expected this with some immediacy.   That is an extreme red flag for socio-emotional issues.  Perhaps she needs that therapist all by her lonesome for a while.\n\n\n\n\nWhile Clair may feel hurt, one has to consider why she feels hurt.  She came into a defined situation, and now she wants to change that situation that works fine as it is to more suit her.  That should be a BIG nope...   While you should encourage your kids to be congenial, and even loving and kind to her, they are under no obligation as burgeoning adults to do more than be cordial.  Further, they are under no obligation to change their plans, or traditions to suit Clair.

There is a difference between being a wife and a mom, and you clearly communicated that you wanted Claire to be your wife, not your children\u2019s mother.

Are you splitting all household costs 50-50 or is Claire only paying  25% of everything? If she is providing half of the cost for bills that is taking a parental role and supporting your children and you are not giving her credit for that. Have you thought of a possibility of giving Claire a special endearment term for the children to call her instead of claire, this might help her feel more included in the family.\n\nEdit to clarify: I say possible agenda because you are not over your late wife and I don't think you wanted to be lonely.

Your kids seem to agree with it now and they are at am age that is acceptable. \n\nNow, I will say this. Ahole or not you are now deeply involved with a very divided family, which isn't particularly fair to anyone. Clearly, resentment blossomed. I think Claire was 110% wrong to do what she did, but I do get where her feeling came from, and they are valid. You are attempting to make sure Claire is not a mom to your kids. However, you are also holding her back greatly from having her own special and unique role. A stepmom does not replace a mom. A stepmom does not lessen a mom. Calling a stepmom an auntie and refusing to let her naturally build some small paternal role with your kids has cheapened her whole experience. \n\nPerhaps you could both quit acting like children yourselves and realize who the Ahole is doesn't matter.

Meggie is and always will be their mother, and it\u2019s tragic but she simply isn\u2019t here to fulfill the duties of motherhood. Claire is. It doesn\u2019t sound like she even wants to be called \u201cmom\u201d, rather just wants to know she is loved and appreciated as well. Her comment about \u201cembracing the person who is here\u201d tells me she may be feeling under appreciated and like it would have to come to her dying to get it. Meggie is up on a pedestal while Claire just wants some recognition. \n\nThis is where compromise and compassion on all fronts will be make or break. In your family, Mother\u2019s Day is Meggie\u2019s day- that\u2019s fair. So maybe you all create your own \u201cClaire\u2019s day\u201d holiday where you show her how much she\u2019s loved and appreciated. \n\nMoms come in all forms whether we refer to them as such or not. Moms are people who love, care for, and support us and always look out for our wellbeing. That\u2019s what you and the kids have. You don\u2019t have to forget about or stop loving Meggie to acknowledge that. Many are not so lucky and end up stuck with a new partner who resents the kids or treats them differently from their own.", "Claire didn't approach you with any of this. She went straight to your kids and then a therapist. And *that* didn't turn out the way she expected. \n\nYou learned she was never happy with the arrangement she agreed to.

These kids were robbed of a normal natural motherly-type relationship with Claire because their father was so militant about their dead mother being the \u2018only\u2019 mother and it\u2019s sad.  These kids are old enough to talk to Claire directly without their dad getting involved.", "The fact that she seemed to try and maneuver around OP and present it straight to the kids makes me think she knew this wasn't ok. \n\nIts the trying to make demands or that the kids \"try\" to do this for her. If she simply issued an invitation and waited for them to warm up to the idea and come around, that's one thing. Her being sneaky, and then trying to get OP to compel the kids to do what she wants is what's wrong in my eyes. Trying to force it NEVER works out well.", "Yep, yep, yep aaaaand... Yep!\n\nEspecially this bit:\n\n>you are basically worshiping her and you forced your kids to do so as well. \n\nThey were so young when she died that I doubt of they have many real memories of her... The version of \"mum\" that they know, is the one created for them by OP. I'm not sure that's healthy to the degree OP has been forcing this \"i won't forget her or move on\" type attitude. \n\n>They were young when she died and while she played a significant role in their life your children have their entire life ahead of them and they need parental figure\n\nAgain absolutely. \n\nMeggie isn't here, Claire is. And she's happy to step into the role of OP would let her. \n\nStepping into a role doesn't mean completely forgetting Meggie. \n\nOP, with the best meaning, YTA.

I don\u2019t think that\u2019s unfair because OP clearly communicated at the beginning of the relationship he was looking for a romantic partner, not a new mother for his children. And again, visiting his dead wife\u2019s grave on Mother\u2019s Day seems very reasonable, wouldn\u2019t really call that worshipping. He\u2019s treating his wife like his wife, and not the children\u2019s mother, because she\u2019s not the children\u2019s mother.

Unfortunately for the teenagers they\u2019ve not had their biological mom for most of their lives, but it seems like their dad has prevented them from being able to be open to additional parental figures at all. From his comments, OP says Claire does literally nothing for the kids in terms of helping around the house/with parenting, and not much with them in terms of fun stuff either. \n\nI\u2019d love to get the kids\u2019 perspectives on how they feel about the worship of their bio mom.", "Exactly! It seems like Claire will always be living in Meggie\u2019s shadow. I honestly would not be able to stay in a marriage where 1.) there is basically a shrine for the late wife, 2.) I don\u2019t get to have any parental role while still having to deal with the kids, 3.) I just overall feel like I am never going to be anyone\u2019s first choice. \n\nThis must feel like such a lonely existence for Claire. I don\u2019t like recommending divorce at all, but I feel like Claire needs to find someone who will truly value and love her.", "You whole perspective seems wrong to me. Since when does handing someone a title equate to completely letting them in? \n\nNot all family is blood and not all blood is family. The same goes for titles. Not all family needs a title and not everyone with a title is family. If Claire needs a title to feel let in then she is more concerned with public perception than actually building her own unique bond with the children.", "Idk, other comments say \"feelings change\" and yes they do, but not inevitably and it seems the kids' feelings haven't as the youngest immediately told dad when something is off. So because Claire's feelings have changed everyone else needs to go to therapy and reevaluate their own feelings, because \"feelings change\"?  \n\nHe says in comments that Claire and his kids spend time together alone and then telling him almost immediately indicates that they feel comfortable talking to him about things that make them uncomfortable. Also, based on his immediate request for therapy, he seems to be open to it as a solution for his girls as well. Also, it doesn't even sound like they do something Mom-centric often. \n\nI just don't get why people are bending over backwards to make OP out to be even partially the AH.

You are holding on to the past and need move on, not just for their sake but for yours and for your wives.

Recognizing a stepmother's role in a child's life does not diminish the love held for their mother.

My husband and I dated for 2 years and have been married for 10 years so we've been together for a total of 12 years. I'll say that I never expected my stepchildren to think of me as their mother or address me as such. I stayed in my lane and left the parenting to their father and mother. It wasn't my place to interfere in those matters. But what I did do for my stepchildren was to make sure that they felt loved when they were with their father and I. I was the one who made holidays and birthdays special by creating a warm, loving home. I gave them plenty of space to sort through the complex feelings that come with the these major changes. I supported my husband as he was navigating through parenting his children. I did the cooking, shopping, cleaning etc. We went on vacations and made some great memories together. I don't expect that I should get some kind of award for simply doing things for them that every child should have in a loving home. And I definitely have never tried to force a relationship with them or to \"make them love me\". I think that some stepparents have a romanticized notion of what that role looks like. You just can't force relationships. That goes both ways.\n\nWith that being said, there were times when I felt like an outsider in my home. There were times when I got frustrated because of how little say I had in decisions that were made. Sometimes my feelings did get hurt by my step kids and I didn't feel like I could express that to them for fear of making things tense. I'm not saying that I was/am perfect either but it's a tricky dynamic. Maybe Claire just wants to feel like she's seen and at least is an important part of your family.

The way you wrote your post is eerily reverential, as if no one is good enough to stand in wherever Meggie may have. You absolutely should have, from the get-go, been on board with whoever you chose, being a co-parent, with the expectation that they would be given the responsibility, authority, respect, and honor that comes with the role.

His children will likely not look back fondly on this controlled narrative that excludes any spontaneous activity or feelings that might build a bridge between the stepmom and his kids.

You\u2019ve set boundaries with your new wife, but I\u2019m reading between the lines here and I\u2019m getting the sense that you\u2019ve set boundaries for your kids as well. You\u2019ve brought them up with the message that although this woman might live with them and play a motherly role in their lives, make no mistake, she is not their mother, and it is an offence against their mothers memory for them to consider her part of the family. Given the framing you\u2019ve conditioned them with, of course they\u2019re going to feel uncomfortable when your wife tries to build a closer relationship with them.\n\nMother\u2019s Day isn\u2019t just for literal mothers. If your wife plays any role in your children\u2019s life at all, I think she deserves a place in your celebrations. It won\u2019t erase their mothers memory. That\u2019s not how this works. It\u2019s not a zero sum game. They don\u2019t have to call her \u201cmom\u201d. But I think your wife deserves to be acknowledged for the role she plays in their lives. Frankly I think actively excluding her from that day is a little bit fucked up.\n\nSo I\u2019m saying YTA with an element of ESH because I don\u2019t think putting pressure on your kids was an appropriate way to handle the situation on her end at all.\n\nThis might be unpopular here considering this community tends to view any pre-set boundaries as holding absolute immutable authority, but I think sometimes things are a little more nuanced than that.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted, but I honestly think this is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. \n\nI think you guys would benefit from individual therapy, on top of couples\u2019 therapy.

However, as someone who\u2019s kind of dealt with this in terms of relationships I will say this:\n\nYes. What Claire said about \u201cif you love me you\u2019ll do this\u201d was wrong and manipulative. I 100% agree with that. But I think you\u2019re missing the forest for the trees here. \n\nThink about where Claire is coming from for just a second. This is a woman who seems to love you and your family. She may certainly be okay with you placing Meggie first. But feelings can and do change over time. \n\nIf Meggie somehow magically walked through the door tomorrow, I ask this: what would you do?\n\nJudging solely from your post, you\u2019d leave Claire in a heartbeat.\n\nAnd the sad part? I think she *knows* that. \n\nAnd coming from someone who loved someone knowing they\u2019d always be second best, that shit is *brutal*. Nothing is worse than knowing you will *always* be second best. You will *always* be an option, and not a choice, no matter how you look at it. And after a while? That shit *hurts*. \n\nNo, she shouldn\u2019t be projecting her urge to be a mother onto your kids, who are honestly well on their way to being adults to begin with. \n\nBut\u2026please think about your relationship with Claire. Really have an honest conversation. You guys have reached an impasse, a crossroads. You both need to have these conversations so you can figure out if you need to walk together\u2026or part ways. \n\nFor the sake of the bot, I\u2019ll say NAH. I just think there\u2019s a lot of pain in this family.", "ESH. Sounds like your wife has been frustrated for a while and I highly suspect she has been treated like she was less than because of the shadow of your late wife. Yes, everyone goes through grief differently but I am always at the side of when a traumatic event starts creeping into your life and is hindering something or hurting others, you need to find help.\n\nI think you need help in trying to get to terms with how her being able to grow into her lawful role as a parent and as your chosen equal in the family DOES NOT change the fact that your late wife was your wife and the mother of your children. They don\u2019t have to call her mom, but I really would suggest it might be nice to seek help when it\u2019s clear the dead might be stopping people from living their lives.", "OP do you think how Claire has gone about this whole situation is what is really bothering you?   I have read your other comments as well and I would be very concerned with an adult in my child's life trying to manipulate her into doing what she wants instead of talking to me as her partner about what she needs.  Secondly, I would be quite concerned that she lied about meeting her son and talking on the phone to him when she wasn't. \n\nSounds like she has some personal issues going on and she is struggling with how she is perceived as a mother.  She was a teenage mom which couldn't have been easy.  Perhaps she and her son have been rehashing past issues, or her son is currently having issues, which has resulted in a strained relationship between them.\n\nI still think the crux of the matter is the lack of intimacy between you and your wife.  You make sure she always knows her place is behind your late wife and she doesn't trust you with her real feelings.  You aren't each other's person.  That's sad but if you truly love her, you can both work on this.  I would encourage continued marital therapy (maybe a new therapist) and individual therapy to deal with the intimacy issues you both have.", "This is why you don't date widowers or widows.", "I'm not sure. Leaning towards NAH.\n\nIt's good that you actively remember your late wife and mother to your children, also good for them too so I would definitely not suggest to you to change any of that. If that also means not calling a stepmom mom for you guys I can definitely understand that too. Plus the remembrance on the saturday before mother's day and all the other little things you probably also do to remember her. She was a very important person in your lives and her memory still is. That's not something in the past like some people suggested. And I can understand that you got emotional about that, b/c it's an emotional thing. If you talked about it with Claire afterwards and apologised about the harshness it's ok I think.\n\nSo now about Claire the second wife and stepmom.\nYou and her had an understanding about what her role to your boys was going to be and somehow her feelings on this changed. Probably because the relationship with her son deteriorated, but maybe also because she started to love your boys more and more as she spent more time with them? (Not sure but could understand that) But sometimes things change with time and she can't help her feelings. It good that she's opened up about it.\n\nI'm going to assume that apart from her pressing your child on the mother's day thing last year their relationship was (and is) still good. I think her loving your children is a very good thing in itself. However, no one should force the children to call her mom. The children definitely shouldn't be pressured about that. That wouldn't be fair on them and is an AH thing to do. Plus it would ruin their relationship with Claire.\n\nI think Claire probably feels a bit excluded sometimes and maybe a bit taken for granted? (Again: assuming but could imagine it to be so)\nShe should come to terms with not being called mom. Same for not having the mother's day things. It's sad for her but that's how things are.\n\nBut maybe you could talk to her about other ways for you to make her feel more part of your family and feel more appreciated? \nI don't know what exactly, but there are many ways to do this. Maybe make her a special breakfast on her birthday together with your sons? \nOr plan some things all of you like to do together and make this a regular thing? (Could even be going out for a meal or something)\nThese are just some suggestions but talk to her about *why* she feels the need to be their mom instead of stepmom and try to come up with some solutions so that she feels that she belongs, without the children having to call her mom and all that.\n\nIf, after that, she still insist on being called mom, she's the ah.\n\nTldr: NAH children shouldn't be pressured. Emotional things happen in a relationship and sometimes harsh things are said, if OP has apologised for the harshness its ok. Probably Claire feels left out sometimes and maybe also a bit underappreciated. It's good she communicated some of this to OP. So try to talk about this together and try to find other ways to  for her to feel she's a part of the family without her being called mom.", "ESH. I may be on the minority here.  Claire messed up by going behind your back with the kids and by not being truthful about her relationship with her son.\n\nYou ....Well, why did you ever remarry?

I'm sill trying to figure out why Claire was even brought into the picture in the first place if she's not allowed to be any sort of parental figure or really have much of a relationship with the kids at all. It's never as simple as \"she's mom or she's not\". OP shouldn't have married her if all he wanted was a companion for himself but not his kids. \n\nClaire did go about it the wrong way by cornering one of the kids, without a doubt, but I also think OP needs to pull some of the stick out of his ass and have a long overdue conversation with everybody, especially now that the kids are older and can have more agency. \n\nI do wonder how much of the kids' feelings stem from OP's adamant \"there is only one mom\" attitude. The kids very likely don't remember their mom. Not that that means she should be disregarded or forgotten about by any means, but how do these kids benefit from being blocked from having NO sort of mother figure with just a dead mom they don't remember?", "It doesn't matter what he or she wants when his girls don't want to call her mom and they don't see her as their mom then you can't force it. As OP and his wife have their own minds and will so have his daughters. They accept her as part of the family, just not as their mother.

It drips of longing and wishing instead of living in the here and now with his current wife.

They didn't want their parent's new partner to be their parent either.", "I feel awful for Claire.  I was in a relationship not unlike hers in terms of it having \"terms\" that I had to \"agree to\" or else the relationship was off.  That's not a choice; it's an ultimatum, and very manipulative in the case of the person giving it.\n\nIn my case the \"terms\" were that we were \"not in a relationship\" and I was therefore not allowed to be invited to go with him out of state to visit his family for holidays etc and he was allowed to sleep with whomever else he wanted, whenever he wanted.  But those \"terms\" were not established as clearly as he tells the story.  He tells it much like OP tells this one.  The reality is, we started dating and fell in love before the relationship was really defined, and part of that was that he too was grieving the (much more recent) death of a partner and he needed space and I was ok with giving it to him.  But I didn't imagine that *seven years later* I'd still be painfully in love with him while he kept me pushed out of the aspects of his life that I wanted so badly to share with him.\n\nI remember so many painful things, like the time we'd just made love in his bedroom, and before the clothes even came back on one of his uncles called him.  I heard the uncle ask about me (because his entire family obviously knew I was in the picture, regardless of what he decided to call it) and my \"not-boyfriend\" responded, with me naked in his bed, \"oh yeah no, no I'm not really seeing her anymore.\"  We hosted holiday parties together, went to family funerals together, he was invited to all of my own family events, slept together, were each-other's best friends and most-trusted confidants, and everyone in our mutual friend circle knew we were a couple.  So...seven years into it, it really hurt that he wouldn't let me in and if anything kept placing more and more extreme boundaries that I never really got a say in while I loved him with every goddamn fiber of my soul.  It *crushed* me every time he slept with someone else, but I went along with it because I didn't know how to leave him and those were the \"terms\" that I had absolutely no say in.  But if I dared to express my unhappiness, or if anyone else asked, again, he'd tell it like OP does.  \"She/you knew this was the agreement so she/you don't have any position to complain.\"  The final straw for me was when I caught him sexting someone while I was sitting right next to him at the Thanksgiving dinner we were hosting together at his house with his family visiting from out of town.\n\nI may be projecting but it really feels like Claire is in a similar place where she is being emotionally held hostage by \"terms\" that, no matter what OP says, she isn't really ok with and from the sound of it never really got a true say in.  If there is any truth to that at all then I would absolutely, 100%, suggest divorce for her sake.  It is such a soul-crushing, self-erasing, and profoundly lonely existence to be in a relationship like that.  OP should not have married her.

It\u2019s another thing to set a boundary where the kids don\u2019t even really see her as a step other, although she does fulfill a parental role, and essentially enshrining his late wife so that Claire, his living wife and partner, is relegated to a second-fiddle role. Claire went about this badly, which is why I think ESH, but OP should never have remarried if he was so determined to impose immovable boundaries and emotionally keep his late wife elevated over his present wife.

OP should have stayed single, for everyone\u2019s sake.", "I never suggested forcing a relationship or meant to imply such.\n\nBut OPs post and comments suggest that he has been diligent about preventing someone from replacing their bio mom their whole lives. The kids are old enough to decide their relationship with Claire, but I think they need independent therapy at this point to detangle their true feelings from OPs actions.\n\nI believe OP meant well, but a lifetime of preserving their bio moms memory and keeping other potential maternal figures away has likely encouraged the children to also reject such a relationship. Maybe the children will continue to reject a stronger relationship, in which case their decision should be honored. But it isn\u2019t fair to anyone (especially the children) for them to make that decision without unbiased counsel.", "Those children have been coerced their whole life to not see Claire as a mother figure thanks to their dead mum who neither will remember. \n\nI'm not that's what's best for the children but it's probably too late now", "I don\u2019t think the children truly decided that without influence.

But how many years have you been married? How many years has she spent watching your kids grow up? Being part of their school events? Watching their successes and learning experiences? Did you really think she wouldn't have some sort of attachment to them over time?  Have you ever considered that your kids might not be telling you what they really want? From an extremely young age, you've been telling them that no one can replace their mother. That you wouldn't allow it. You've built up their mom to be this mythical figure that no one can replace. They are very clear about what your expectations are you've drilled it into their head all their lives. But is that really fair? \n\n   You cut off any possibility of them bonding and developing a real relationship with Claire. But I have to tell you, as a mom, if I passed away when my kids were too young to really remember me, I would want them to have a mom. I would want someone who loved them like their own, someone they could love and bond with. I'd want my children to have a mother not just some lady that lives in the house. Love isn't a pie where the pieces get smaller the more you divide them. You could have taught your kids that their love for their mom would never go away, just expand to include more people including Claire. Honestly, I think you did your kids a disservice", "Honestly you're fighting pretty hard to *not* have your partner included as any kind of mother figure here, which is understandably pretty shit for her. Your children are also likely heavily biased towards following what you want - especially as it's such an emotional topic and even moreso if you're not dealing with things around the topic as well as you could be.\n\nEveryone here sounds like they need counseling to sort these deep issues out. It's not healthy to look on a new partner at all as a 'replacement' when that's certainly not what anyone would (healthily) want. And then at the same time clearly your partner is dealing with being shoved aside all these years into a position where they can't feel like as much of a family member as they deserve to be. I don't feel like they're asking for much, but sure.. they're not going about it correctly either. It just sounds like a perpetual problem that's weighing everyone down, when it doesn't need to be like that.", "NTA for this specifically, but please keep in mind-and I\u2019m saying this gently-that your kids were too little to remember their mom. She will always be their mom, but they don\u2019t actually remember anything about her. They\u2019re only going off of what you\u2019ve told them about her. I think that it would be different for Claire if your kids were older when mom died because then there\u2019s memories that they don\u2019t want to replace. I think it\u2019s harder for Claire because she knows that your kids don\u2019t remember their mom and yet she\u2019s still second place\u2014not to a memory but to a whole character that their dad created for them.", "If Claire has her special place can she have a special day alongside Maggie as mom? Your kids were 2 and 3 when Maggie died, they don't have much of a relationship outside what you have raised them to have. They wouldn't have many independent memories of her.\n\nAs their mom Maggie should definitely be celebrated and recognised as their mom but if they've known Clare since they were young they can visit their mom's grave, visit the diner and then give Clare a dinner or something, if Clare has been a motherly figure to them. Clare being a motherly figure doesn't mean she replaces Maggie and she shouldn't but your kids can appreciate both their biological mom who'd probably have given anything to be there for them and their motherly figure in the same day without slighting either of them if that's what they feel they can do and want to do.", "I totally get what you are saying. This last Mother's Day I realised that I had a few 'Mams' (what we call them in Wales!). My birth Mam passed away seven years ago at the ripe old age of 83 and she is the only person I have considered Mam until recently. However, this year I had a bit of an epiphany and messaged by Step Mam for the first time on Mother's Day (have known her for 30 years), my partner's Mam (have known her for 11 years) and my best friend's Mam (have known her for 30 years). I can't say exactly why but this year, aged 50, it felt right to acknowledge them all in that roll. Not as my Mam. But as maternal figures of huge importance in my life. However, as you can see from the amount of time I have known them all, it has taken a long time for me to get there. It's not like I haven't loved and valued them since now. It's just that something clicked and felt right to see them as something more now. \n\nI have also been on the other end of the situation. I started seeing my partner 11 years ago not too long after his wife passed away from cancer. His daughter was 7 and very much remembered her Mum. I knew her Mum and she was a wonderful person. So while she accepted me with open arms, she wasn't looking for a new Mum and, as the Mam to a 9 year old daughter, I wasn't looking to replace her Mum or to fulfil any needs I had to be seen in a maternal way. We've never put a name to it but have developed our own special relationship slowly over many years. She is now almost 19 and this Mother's Day, for the very first time, she sent me a card. It said I was the 'Bees Knees' and she very much valued how I had been there for her over the years. Very much unprompted and mahoosively appreciated by me. Ok, so I ugly cried. Sue me! \n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that while there are indeed many different kinds of maternal figures in our lives, it is always up to us to decide if and when a person becomes that to us. It is not about what we want as maternal figures or what the maternal figures in our lives want from us. It has to be chosen in it's own time. \n\nFinally, to give a judgement, OP is NTA. He has been guided by his children and their wants and needs. It should come from them when, and if, they are ready to see her in that way. It cannot, and should not, come from OP's wife. It should never be forced. And, if and when it does come? Well I've learned it has a deeper and more cherished meaning for evolving in it's own time and way.", "Let\u2019s see if an award will move the comment up a bit. I also think it should be the top comment, because I think the commenter pretty much nailed it. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think OP was ready to remarry when he married Claire, and perhaps still isn\u2019t. His first wife was undoubtedly wonderful, and she still seems to be the love of OP\u2019s life (reading between some lines here, but that\u2019s the vibe I\u2019m getting from OP\u2019s post). That  leaves Claire essentially competing with an angel ghost for her place in OP\u2019s heart and in the family. I\u2019ve seen this before and it usually leads to family issues. I don\u2019t think Claire is handling it especially well, but neither is OP. OP wanted someone to act as a mother figure and co-parent for his children, with all the responsibility of the role but with limited \u201ccredit\u201d (for lack of a better word) for her contribution. And he obviously wanted a companion and sexual partner for himself. But he seems to have assigned the role of \u201csecond-wife-second-best to Claire, and that\u2019s not fair to her, or to the family as a whole.

At that point, I think the step-parent being seen as a 'parent' is less likely.   \n\nThe kids in OP were a lot younger and it may or may not have been what they chose. Seems like dad didn't give any chance to let anything develop naturally and always put a barrier there.", "That's literally more time than their bio mom was in their lives, though.\n\nLike, the issue here isn't just that the kids don't see a new stepmom as their mother, but that it seems like OP has basically deified a person they literally cannot possibly remember, and has placed some pretty absurd boundaries on his wife to prevent her from doing anything *remotely* maternal (like, cooking for the family or being the one who drives to the doctor's office) even if it would help out the family.", "I'm not invalidating their feelings, I'm saying the dad is speaking for the kids, he's not telling you how they really feel. We don't know the way the conversation went or how he worded things. \"How do you feel about this\" is a lot different from \"Were going through this and this is what I think about it, how do you feel?\"  \n\nIt's not ridiculous to say the kids are just telling their dad what he wants to hear.", "That's what he says, but the context says otherwise. They wouldn't feel his exact level of grief to the same extent without it being imposed on them. Why are so many of you refusing to accept you can't form memories that early? They literally never knew their mother, so it's farfetched to assume they feel the same way their dad does without his input.", "This is also a true angle in this story that claire is not happy either when one day is dedicated to meggie even after having her own son.", "I really hope OP reads this and emotional koala and takes both to heart.  OP, I get the feeling you may be over trying? to have your kids remember Meggie?  As Bubbynee says - there are all sorts of Mom love - and a good parent wants their children to have as much love in their lives as they possibly can.  I have to say NAH here - but OP, if you are the one \"pushing\" your kids to keep Meggie \"alive\" then you need to adjust your thinking.", "LMAO, no.  My dad and his twin were 4 when their mother died.  Their dad remarried and did exactly what you all seem to think OP should have done, pushed a motherly relationship on them.

They were 11 and 12 at that point.  Completely reasonable that they make up their own mind and don't want another mother. \n\nThey're 15 and 16 now. If they don't feel that way about her, it's okay. They're old enough to decide what they want.", "The way you phrased this, put a sad thought in my head. OP made a (probably good at the time) decision to find a partner for *himself*, not a partner in his *life* or the life of his children. He basically dictated that his kids had one mum, that\u2019s it, you don\u2019t get another one. Those poor girls have been denied a potentially significant part of a family dynamic, while OP got everything he wanted out of the deal. \n\nThe daughters may be fine with how it\u2019s all turned out now and be okay not having a mum (or even a second parent, by the sounds) around any more, but sure as HECK was that OPs decision, not theirs, since they were *literal toddlers*. OP dictated this for them 100%. \n\nThis is all so terribly sad.", "Thank you. I agree. Everyone, including OP, are being held emotionally hostage to a memory.", "I think part of it comes from the fact that these kids were extremely young when their mother died and OP has held very rigid standards for the role. He says the kids don't want OP's wife to fill the mother role at all, but how much of that is projection? How much of that is the kids going with what dad wants? How much of it is their own feelings? It feels like a grey area where we can't actually know how the kids feel because of how big OP's feelings are about it. \n\nThe conversation with the kids could've gone like \"Y'all don't want her to replace Meggie, right?\" and the kids would be inclined to agree. \n\nOr it could've been that the kid brought it up and said \"Dad, we really don't want to see your wife as a mother figure.\" \n\nThere's nuance.

Nowhere does he say the kids don't consider her a stepmother or part of the family, and even goes out of his way to explain that the kids DO see her as family, just not as a mother figure. Why? BECAUSE THEIR MOM DIED. THEIR MOM DIED AND SHE WILL ALWAYS BE THEIR MOM, AND THEIR STEPMOM IS NOT A MOTHER TO THEM.

We don't know, a poor relationship with no further detail could mean anything.\n\nMy sibling has a poor relationship with my parents. It's partly their fault for being an entitled ass and partly my parents' fault for enabling entitled assery when they were younger when my sibling likely had issues that needed addressing but they had no real help in identifying the issues and learning how to deal with them. It makes my parents people doing the best they could, their best wasn't ideal but I don't think that makes them bad people. My dad (after they divorced) had a girlfriend with younger kids. He told me they got in touch with him once they were adults and acted like he thought I'd be mad. I wasn't, he's my dad but he meant something to them and if they want to embrace him as family they can. He's still my dad, he'll be there for me even if he's there for his ex's kids and he'd be there for my sibling if their behavior didn't mean giving up for his mental health. I was yelling at my sibling in a phone call for calling me asking for money and not even asking if I still had a job (I'd told them about 2 months earlier my work was laying off people) but once I said I could send money they lost interest and ditched the call. I gave up because the relationship isn't what I wanted it to be, which is anything even remotely resembling reciprocal.", "Exactly!

Clearly she was wrong.   \n\nOP doesn't state how long Claire has been in their lives, but it seems she has been there for some time.  It's not fair to any woman to ask her to take on the role that Claire has. OP should have hired a series of nannies for his kids, and casually dated on the side. If OP can't handle a woman being a full part of life, then he shouldn't get to slot one in to be his permanent bang-maid/nanny.  No person should have to play second fiddle to a dead spouse for the rest of their life.   \n\nYes, he might get lonely from time to time.  That's the price he has to pay for giving a ghost the prime spot in his and his children's lives.  He should have waited until his children were grown to look for a new partner.   And he should have looked for a woman who was the same has him - someone still in love with someone else that he would always be in second place as well.", "He said somewhere that he only met Claire's son a handful of times because he was already an adult and he isn't intrested.\n\nSo it seems Clair had at least an 18 year old when they started to date. (Got married when Clair was 35.) So I assume they didn't date longer than 2-3 years.", "It's also pretty manipulative. It means she intentionally tried to find a \"loophole\" in OP's request, by appealing to the kids who would (if they had agreed) try to change OP's mind.", "You're the one being ridiculous, by jumping to assumptions.", "Lied? While most therapists are supposed to remain neutral, they will break that rule on occasion.\n\nSuch as, you cannot force a child into a relationship they're uncomfortable with. You cannot force a child to see you as a parent.", "Therapists can phrase things in certain ways that aren't agreeing with either party but it can appear they are, for example 'Claire you know the relationship dynamic OP and the girls were wanting and willing for you to fulfill regarding parenting them, what's changed that you think it would be fair for everyone involved to change that now?'.  OP would think the therapist is agreeing with him, when in reality the therapist is trying to understand Claire's viewpoint better and get her to think of the other people in the situation. \n\n\nAlso therapists are humans and sometimes say things then think shit I shouldn't have said that.", "That's definitely not good, but it's also not evidence of a bad relationship.  Many adult kids have a period of minimal contact with their parents just because they're exploring their new lives as independent adults.  Then the communication improves again after a few years.  Claire lying is not good, but I can see any parent being stressed by this period.\n\nMain point is though, is there any reason OP and the kids can't bend just a little rather than being stiff about it, and show appreciation for a very real parental figure who has been dedicated to them for many years?  The oak in the hurricane breaks, the palm bends and survives.  The kids don't have to be sappy or call her mom of course, but OP can absolutely honor BOTH his spouses, alive and dead.  Because it's not supposed to be a competition.", "Tf is this BS", "I definitely feel a bit weird about going to her grave for over a decade. Instead of doing something that honors her personhood, it feels like endless grieving for someone that they can't remember. \nI have a 4 year old and an under one year old. They won't remember me if I pass away. I don't want their childhood memories of me to be a grave.\nMy mother just passed away a year ago and there's so many things that I want to introduce my children to, that isn't a gravestone.", "Dad has been telling them since they were young that no one can replace their mom. That they'll never have another mom. Those kids know exactly where their dad stands on the issue and maybe they feel the same. But maybe they do want a closer relationship with Claire and are afraid to disappoint/upset their dad. You don't think that's even a possibility?", ">\the should have looked for a woman who was the same has him - someone still in love with someone else that he would always be in second place as well.\n\nYes, I agree this would really be the only fair way to go about it. OP should have taken that into consideration. The reality is, if he wants to spend the rest of his life making his dead wife his priority, he never should have gotten remarried. \n\nSaying that he made his terms clear from the beginning only goes so far. Because it is actually not fair to ask a partner for what he\u2019s asked, and he should have understood that and stuck to dating casually for the rest of his life. If someone really loves and cares about you and wants to be with you, they are going to try their best to meet your needs and respect your boundaries, that\u2019s why Claire was willing to try things his way. But unless he is willing to do the same for her it is an inherently one-sided dynamic that will not be sustainable over the long term. OP gets all the space he needs for his feelings, while Claire has to settle for his emotional leftovers, and is supposed to be okay with that. \n\nShe tried that, for 4 years, and now she\u2019s realizing that always coming second to a dead woman in her marriage leaves her cheated emotionally. OP is confronting the fact that he has not been realistic here. And unfortunately, unless he is willing to be a true partner to his current wife and sincerely willing to make some adjustments in their relationship as needed to keep it viable for both of them, the marriage will probably be over. Which is for the best, really, because he can get back to loving his dead wife full time without the distraction of a living woman and her emotional needs.", "I think either possibility could be true. The kids may genuinely feel that way. And the kids could also be afraid of disappointing their dad. And the father really doesn't seem to consider that possibility at all.", "But did your stepmother do the work of a mother but get no recognition? Did she make supper every night, drive you to the mall or practice or wherever. Pick up that poster board you needed for a project. Take you to the doctors, etc\n\nI don't think they need to call her mother, but appreciation for someone who's there for you is a good thing. It doesn't even have to be Mother's Day. Maybe they take her out for her birthday and say thank you.", "Yeah that would be hard for kids to adjust to thinking of her as maternal at all if they were basically tweens when they met cause who knows how long it took for dad to introduce them since he seems pretty protective.", "They're also teens who can slowly change their mind. If they want to have a closer relationship with Claire, they are free to do so on their own. If they tell Claire that they are grateful for her presence in their lives, that's their choice. Just because they don't want to spend Mother's Day with her, doesn't mean they don't value her presence in their lives. Maybe in a few years they'll decide that her presence was indeed like motherhood to them. We sure don't get to decide what their relationship is and/or should be. Don't know why others keep trying to accuse the OP of pushing this mentality onto his kids. Yeah, parents have a major influence on their kids but teen years are when you start to separate yourself from your parents and make your own choices, have your own beliefs. It's not OP's fault at all.", "Right, I feel like I'm going insane! Meanwhile on the other hand reddit will totally come to the defense of someone in the same position as OP's kids..", "It's because OP is a man. He's given no grace, no benefit of the doubt and little understanding. The woman who lied about several key issues and tried to manipulate his children behind his back is somehow afforded all those things though.", "Over the past few months there has been a bad trend of this sub having an insane bias against men.  I have noticed that a lot of comments will use male pronouns when referring to who they think is the AH in the situation even when the post in genderless or when the post clearly says the person identifies as other than male.  Hell there was one post I saw that OP did not identify the gender of anyone involved yet every N T A comment reffered to OP as a woman with their partner as a man while every Y T A post reffered to OP as a man and their partner as a woman.  Even yesterday there was a post about how a woman was seriously sexually harassing a man in the workplace and the comments were calling him an AH for insulting her when she wouldn't take no for an answer.", "Sorry people like intimacy and love in their lives \ud83d\udc80like what is the thought process here? He just has to die alone now because his first wife died and obviously that means no more love for op ever again", "But it sounds like they DO appreciate Claire and have a familial relationship with her.  I think maybe having a Family Day or something like that for Claire would be cool, but it sounds like Claire very specifically wants to be honored as a mother, when that's not the relationship the kids want with her.  She wants to be honored on Mother's Day, in place of Meggie, and take on a motherly role with the kids.  That's not what OP and his kids are okay with, and they've been very clear and upfront on that from the beginning, while still having their own special relationships with her.", "This is it for me too. Keep in mind Claire was a teen mum so probably had it pretty tough figuring it all out as a parent back then. Who knows whether she had any type of support system to help her navigate that? I\u2019m not at all surprised that a) her relationship with the son isn\u2019t perfect and b) she\u2019s trying to \u2018second chance\u2019 raise these other two kids, with seemingly little gratitude or even very clear boundaries. Is she even a parent in this scenario? or just the \u2018family friend\u2019 who lives with them?", "I agree with this. Different scenario (divorce), but the same issues apply. I remember a period where my stepmother and step grandmother were trying to force us to use \"mom\" and \"grandmother\" towards them. This was extremely uncomfortable for my brother and I because while we didn't have the word for it at the time ( we were children), this felt like betrayal against our actual mother and grandmothers. Betrayal is an extremely difficult thing for anyone to process and it's a boundary that should never be crossed. No exceptions.\n\nClaire is being selfish in a way that is disrespectful to the children, husband, and their memory of a woman who cannot advocate for herself in death. Claire is the only asshole here, because she isn't demonstrating gratitude for the acceptance she's been given, and is demanding a role that she can never earn (and shouldn't even consider asking for). She may have been a wonderful caregiver to these kids growing up, but she will never be the person who conceived them and gave them life: a role that is sacred to most people.", "I can see why he wouldn't think it an option. If he knows himself that he has never pressured the kids then it makes sense to me.", "She didn't do those things but we also do celebrate her birthday every year.", "My dad and his twins step-mother did all that, they were required to call her mom and treat her as their mother, and did care about her, but to this day, my dad only visits his birth mom\u2019s grave on Mother\u2019s Day, and only truly considers her his mom, even though she died when he and his twin were 4.", "OP didn't say in a comment before when they met her first, just the time of the wedding. He cleared that up now in an edit, his kids met her 5 years ago. \n\nOP added this to the post:\n\n>ETA: I remarried 4 years ago. My kids have known her 5 years. When we discussed what Claire's role would be and the fact she would not be a mother to my children, she wanted it to be clear that she didn't want to do all the work for none of the motherly benefits. So we agreed I would parent and she would enjoy a relationship with the kids. It might be more strict than some would say is normal and I will acknowledge that. But we did communicate about this a lot before we married and when we were still figuring out things. This was fine at first. But then her relationship with her son deteriorated. She lied about that to me for at least a year. Then it became a problem that we had agreed she would not be a mother to my children. Because she wanted that stronger adult relationship and was not going to have that with her son.", "I don't think it's OPs fault at all. I think OP is doing the right thing for his kids.\n\nThe youngest went to him bc they were uncomfortable and I feel like everyone blaming OP is glossing over that.", "You shouldn't marry to just have a sex buddy that your kids are cool with. If you want to get married, you should understand that means partnership, and if you don't want your partner to co parent, wait to get married till after the kids move out. As of right now she is just a live in sex buddy that is expected to babysit occasionally.", "His poor daughters could have had a loving mother in their lives during their adolescent years but OP had to control their relationship for his own obsession.

She accepted your very clear terms to be in a relationship with you and your kids, and then decided she doesn\u2019t agree with them anymore. \n2. She went and tried to manipulate your child behind your back. \n3. She lied about her relationship with her son. Huge red flag right there, she should try to fix that instead of wanting to play mom to your kids.\nIt may sound drastic but I think this is a good opportunity to rethink your relationship with Claire. It\u2019s clear that what she wants is not in line with what you and your kids want, and she seems fine with manipulating you and your kids to get what she wants. You need to protect your kids first and foremost.", "NTA - You told her from the beginning that you nor the kids wanted a mother and that she needed to be okay with that. You've also went on to say that you basically kinda drilled this home to her before you went through with the marriage. It is not you or your kids fault that she and her son have a strained relationship. Forcing the children to do something they don't want will just make them resent her in the end and it will just be a repeat of what happened with her son, as far as them having a strained relationship. And as long as they aren't treating her bad and still see her as family she should feel good about that. In all realness, if she continues to love them and treat them as she always has (without forcing her wants on them) then when they grow up she will have a close relationship with them. \n\nWould it possibly make her feel better to have like a \"step-mom's day\"? Maybe like the day before Mother's day or the weekend before or after?", "I actually feel really bad for Claire. Her role in this \"family\" is ambiguous and shut out. There's OP and the girls as a unit still engaged with a woman who has been dead nearly 15 years, and then there's Claire. What you agree to ahead of time (which is ultimately in theory) doesn't always work out in practice, and I think she's finding that out. It sounds like she wants to be part of the family and she's not being allowed. After all, it's really hard to compete with a dead woman. If OP is going to continue prioritizing Meggie over his living wife then this marriage probably isn't going to work. He's entitled to remain faithful to Maggie's memory for the rest of his life, but not to insist that his children do, or his current wife. I think he has a choice to make, but it's not about what he claims. BTW, I don't think anyone is an AH, just fragile humans trying to live as best they know how.", "YTA. The kids were too small to decide anything. You decided it for them, and pushed your views into them once they grew up. She has been taking the roll of a mom already for a long time,  like it or not. She doesn't has to be called mom by your kids tho. I think you're mixing things here to the extreme.", "Yta. Has it ever occurred to you you can do both? Visit moms grave and take stepmom out for a bite to eat? Whether you like it or not she is still a parental figure. She deserves more respect.", "YTA - those children will not even remember their dead mother. Your new wife is probably more a mother role to them than she ever was and they probably don\u2019t want to change the Mother\u2019s Day ritual because it would hurt you. \n\nYour family dynamic sounds whack as hell. You can\u2019t just have your wife not act like a mother to children she\u2019s helping to raise. Weird as hell. She probably loves them and sees them as her children and you\u2019re still hung up over your dead wife when you have a new wife who (it sounds like) wants to be a part of your children\u2019s lives.", "I love how its somehow's OP's fault that his kids don't want his new wife as their new mom haha! Because he \"brainwashed\" them.\n\nNTA OP. Claire was fine with the arrangement until she admittedly gave up on her son and now she wants a do-over with your daughters. That's fucked up.", "Info: how long have you been married? \n\nNTA, but I get why she would want a little recognition about her role as step mom- especially if you\u2019ve been married a long time and she had a hand in raising your kids with you. Just to feel some semblance of inclusion.  I\u2019m viewing this through my lens as a step kid who adores her step dad and step mom (both parents remarried) and as my role as a step mom.  \n\nI don\u2019t want to replace my stepKids\u2019 mom, but they do show me love. They\u2019re adults now. I also have my own 2 kids (13m, 16m) and they love my husband, but don\u2019t call him dad. They do call him dad when speaking about him to other people \u201cyeah, my dad works on computers\u201d etc\u2026 we\u2019re just not militant in forcing our roles on our kids. I tell people I have 4 kids, and my husband does too. \n\nI\u2019m also just not big on Mother\u2019s/Father\u2019s Day anyway, and neither are my folks. I loved getting the hand made gifts my kids made at school when they were little, but otherwise, I don\u2019t care to get cards or go to lunch somewhere. My husband just makes me mimosas all day (he calls them \n\u201cMom-osas\u201d lol!) and that does it for me! \n\nYour wife knew your expectations so I get it, but that doesn\u2019t mean she didn\u2019t have a surprise change of heart.  \n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your loss. Your late wife sounds like she was pretty amazing. \u2764\ufe0f", "I would say NTA. *However*, you can have two mother figures.\n\nFor example: my mom has two father figures. She has her biological dad that she was really close to and she also has her stepdad who she was also really close to. She calls both of them dad and truly saw both of them this way. When she talks about them she\u2019ll say \u201cDad [last name]\u201d for clarification when telling stories from before her biological dad died (he died about 17 years before her stepdad).\n\nI would also like to point out that in my example, my mom\u2019s biological dad died when she was 38. She had both dads growing up. Obviously, your children should see their mom as their mother. *And*, depending on when they met your wife and how involved she\u2019s been in their lives, it would make sense for her to feel like they\u2019re her kids and want them to reciprocate those feelings. That wouldn\u2019t excuse her behavior, it merely what her perspective might be. But her saying she always wanted a better relationship with an adult child does make it seem forced and not like she organically thought of your kids as her own children.", "NTA, you are respecting your kids wishes by not forcing that on them. I applaud you as some parents would try to tell their kids it\u2019s time to move on. You made it clear since the beginning and she agreed to get into the relationship with those rules. It sounds like you never indicated that anything will change. She is a AH a little bit by trying to break her promise.\n\nThere is an issue that needs to be fixed. She is lonely on Mother\u2019s Day and her relationship with her kid. She should work on trying to repair that instead of giving up on that. Tell her she has a relationship with your kids but she is also ruining that by forcing a different kind of relationship and forcing that will make it worse. She wants to celebrate Mother\u2019s Day but it doesn\u2019t have to be where your kids call her mom. How long is your celebration? Can you take her to dinner? Maybe suggest getting her spend with her parents. Sometimes she needs something to fill the void and maybe she can get a pet and be a pet parent.", "NTA.  You had an agreement and she wants to change it to suit her, not the rest of the family.  It sounds like she wants to act as a mom to your kids because her son doesn't want a close relationship.  If she wanted to do this as a benefit to the kids, that is one thing but she is acting purely selfish here. Good luck", "NTA\n\nYour wife is throwing out a lot of red flags here. \n\n- She's lying to you about the nature of her relationship with her son and has been for quite some time.\n- She is reneging on agreements she made before you got married without even letting you know.\n- She did the above by trying to guilt trip your minor children while going behind your back.\n- She thinks it is okay for her to use your children for her own emotional satisfaction and falls to see them as autonomous beings with their own emotions and needs different from her own. \n\nThis woman is too self centered to be a competent parent. Please protect your children from her.", "NTA.   First of all, I admire your honouring your late wife and mother of your children.  Recently we had a case here where a young man and his brother were forced to give up every photo and memento of their mother within a few months of their loss, not even allowed to talk about her, as their father moved on quickly.  They were around 5 and 6 years old and it hurt them now even as young adults.  So I take my hat off to you for remembering her. \n\nAnyhow, in this case I think that your current wife should not have gone to your kids about this first.  You have an established path that you tread on Mother\u2019s Day, just one day that you spend with your children to go and remember their mum.  \n\nI think that Claire sees the upcoming empty nest that she was cushioned from by the presence of your children.  Whether you realise it or not, she has been there for you and your children and probably does deserve a modicum of respect/acknowledgment for stepping up.  She has been there since they were small, and probably loves them a lot.  But she should not have gone to them and asked them to suggest changing plans.  \n\nSo, this has in part happened because there is a problem or two between her and her son.  Is it fixable?  She may be feeling \u201cWhat was it all for?\u201d  She could be feeling lonely, undervalued and possibly even depressed.  I think she needs to know that she is loved, even if it\u2019s only you telling her.   Why don\u2019t you and your children take her out the day before so that she knows she is valued.

I understand that you say \"it was discussed\" or \"she knew what I expected\" but who could ever anticipate being a \"fill-in\" at the level that you require out of Claire? You're more or less saying \"I need you to do all the wife/motherly duties BUT DO NOT EVER EXPECT TO BE THAT.\" There is nothing wrong with her being a mother-figure to your children ESPECIALLY given the ages they were when Meggie passed. You're essentially requesting that Claire spend decades being no one to your kids when realistically, by the time they are college-aged adults, Claire will have already been their mother for all of their lives. At that rate, Meggie will be a distant memory despite how desperate you are to keep her relevance within the family.\n\nYou're putting too many rules on something that should be an organic connection. I respect that you and Meggie discussed this \"in depth\" prior to her death but situations change and IMO, you're damaging everyone in the living mix to cater to someone who is no longer here.", "NTA- Your number one priority is your kids and you are doing that excellently. If your kids are also of the same mind that your wife is not their mother I see no problem here, your wife knows what was agreed and now she wants things changed by going behind your back to your children.

You are a good dad OP. Your children's opinions are what are important, if your wife forces anything it will sour their relationship. Of course your wife should be important to you and you both need to be open with each other as it isn't fair for her to feel pushed to the side, she is apart of your family too but that doesn't give her the right to push things onto your kids.

She has actually nurtured them for longer than their natural mother did, so you need to respect that and so do these children, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the children demanding to keep Mum in their memories I think it\u2019s you love, it\u2019s very sad, you\u2019ve not moved on, and you are rooming your children to live without the love of a mother because of your attitude. \nThey have not benefitted from you re marrying, only you. You are having your manly needs taken care of by your new wife , while emotionally remaining attached to your dead wife, and holding your children back from forming a bond with Claire. I wish Claire all the best, I feel for you poor kids, who don\u2019t know any better, and suspect that the days of this marriage are numbered\u2026\u2026", "YTA and should just separate from Claire because clearly you to blind to see that even though she did not birth those kids, she is still a mom and you nor them are willing to accept that. Let Clair go find a family that will accept her and you and your kids ca visit graves for the rest of time or at least until they marry and you all alone while they start their lives and maybe then Claire will be accepted by you lol .", "ESH because you have created a very awful dynamic here. Your kids likely don't have real memories of Meggie, only what you've planted and you've stopped them from ever having another parental relationship outside of you. Claire sucks for bringing this up on mother's day, but I'd say most is on you.", "I'm torn between Nobody is the A and ESH on this.\nThis is kind of the stepparent equivalent of \"friends with benefits.\" No matter what kind of agreement was reached beforehand, SOMEONE was bound to get hurt. \nNobody is the A, because I'm assuming you both went into this intending to honor the agreement. \nBut, conversely, She's (partially) an A for now wanting to violate the terms of the agreement, and you're (again, partially) an A both for expecting her to be able to hold to this arrangement forever, and for remarrying when your kids weren't ready to accept a stepmother. She has all of the responsibilities of a wife, but none of the \"privileges\" of being the wife in a home that has children.\nYou should probably have just dated, but not married until your kids were ready to welcome her as a stepmother.", "NTA. Period.\n\nSome of the comments are so frustrating. As a woman I find that men get such weird treatment on this sub.\nIt's never simply, nta. There's always a \"but\". It can never be cut and dry. Which I understand, life is not cut and dry or black and white but come on.\n\nThere is nothing to suggest that this man is:\n\nA. Forcing this on his kids, they want the relationship but are afraid to upset him\n- The children were the ones to approach him and tell him they were uncomfortable. They're not toddlers, they know what's uncomfortable and have communicated it\n\nB. Having his wife do all the parenting/taking all responsibility for the kids and now he's denying her a small title\n- while I'm sure she likely does take on a parental role, that still does not mean she gets to insert herself where she is not wanted, nor give herself the title of mom. Specially after being told from the start that the children aren't looking for a \"mom\"\n\nC. Has zero sympathy for the current wife in the situation, and used therapy as a way to \"win\" or be proved \"right\" \n- I believe the point about the therapist \"agreeing\" with him was not a dig. Just simply that the therapist also believes that you cannot force this, nor go behind your husband's back and pressure his children to let go of their mother/make her their mother. \n\nWhile I can completely understand the current wife's feelings, it's her feelings to deal with in a healthy adult manner. It's logical that in the beginning she understood where he was coming from and maybe didn't expect to feel so attached to his children that she'd want to be included as mom but again, that's her thing.\n\nHe stated right away how things would be and she agreed. If her feelings changed or she wanted to be included in things, that's a conversation to have with OP and they move forward from there.\n\nThere are SO many posts on here where the dad remarries and inevitably let's the new wife steamroll her way into and over everything. It's truly not up to any of the adults what kind of a relationship the kids have with anyone. That is their choice alone to make. \n\nAs someone who has both my parents alive, as well as step parents, I can say I have no parental/personal connection to any of them. My grandparents were always more of my parents. Doesn't mean I don't love them all, it's just different. You literally cannot force it, and if you try it'll make things worse.\n\nI applaud OP, it's not up them to determine how the kids feel and nipping this in the bud sooner rather than later is the best course of action. New wife needs to understand her feelings are valid, but they are hers to process.", "For me all the things you said is why I think op is an A H (along with Claire). It\u2019s likely op is (unintentionally) pressuring his kids to idolize a woman they don\u2019t even remember", "I agree with you. But, I think this is something that'll take long term therapy to fix. Sorry if long.\n\nOP was dating by the time the kids were 10-11. People are saying that he denied the wife a motherly relationship, but they're missing another component. I didn't have a second parent until the one I had dated around that age, so that's where I'm approaching this from.\n\nThe children might not have any interest in a second parent.\n\nNot every child is the same, but saying that OP should've given his wife more opportunity ignores the possibility of them not wanting that opportunity. By 10, kids understood the family dynamic. They know how their lives function. If they don't want a second parent, then they don't want one.\n\nThoughts can change, but there's no reason for them to want a second 'parent'. Dad is dad. Mom has passed and that was their Mom. The new wife's position can evolve, but she's killing any chance of it by placing expectations on people who have no interest in what she wants.\n\nShe's definitely damaged the relationship by forcefully making the children and her spouse responsible for her mental health. She's unhappy right now, so she's trying to force the mother position. If the kids don't give it to her, she gets upset. So, she makes OP responsible by saying if he loves her/wants her to be happy, then he'll help make the kids do what she wants.\n\nLong term therapy is necessary so she learns/understands her role and her responsibility. Her feelings can be shared with her husband, but not the children. They are not the children's problem. If she wants a relationship change, she needs to work on it.", "Exactly this. I need this info to make a sound judgment. Seems sad and wrong if he doesn't acknowledge it at all with his current wife.", "Hell yeah, great ending line!", "He didn't start to date immediately after his wife died, he waited a few years and BEFORE he started dating again he asked his daughters about their opinion and guess what? They told him and he respected THEIR wishes.", "NTA- But\u2026.. I think you\u2019ve become so focussed on not erasing Meggie, you are perhaps doing a little bit of cutting off your nose to spite your face in your current relationship. I\u2019ve been in the position that your current wife is in. You need to recognize that there could be multiple people who love your children that wont take over the role or the special place in your lives that your wife occupied.\n\nPeople in the position of Claire often are responsible for doing emotional, lifting with the children whether you recognize it or not without any acknowledgement for anything that they do. Honestly, even just a slight recognition of her involvement as a part of your family I think is an important part going forward. And just because you do that doesn\u2019t mean that you have denigrated.Meggies memory in anyway. And in fact what you could do is, maintain your Mother\u2019s Day celebration one weekend and then maybe have an appreciation day for Claire on a different weekend. \n\nAnother way to think about it is, Mother\u2019s Day is just an opportunity to say thank you for what you do. By denying her any of this, you\u2019re basically saying, you\u2019re not an important part of what makes our family. And people like her are often put in this position where they can\u2019t win. In my opinion, what you\u2019ve set up is untenable from an emotional standpoint and set up artificial boundaries. Your children will read it off of you, and perhaps they have chosen to not engage because of how you represent the way, you want the relationship to be, but maybe not the way the children want the relationship to be.", "The Sunday after Mother's Day is Step Mother's Day, can you compromise and do something with Claire on that day to celebrate her and all she does for the kids? I'm a step mom and while I'll never be mom to my bonus kids, I have raised them full time for the last 11 years and I would be hurt if I was completely ignored for Mother's Day so I understand where she's coming from. Being a step parent is a hard role to have.", "Which is fine, as long as she never does parental duties. Being expected to raise kids but not getting the respect for that roll is messed up. As long as she helps less than any other family member though, perfectly ethical and fair. But she should never be asked or expected to help with the kids.", "So Mother\u2019s Day I will do things for both my mum and step mum. One doesn\u2019t diminish the other. \n\nYour wife has been a mum to your kids. She\u2019s been there for them for years. Just because she\u2019s not their late mother, doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not a mum to them because it\u2019s not about what you call each other or what\u2019s written down. It\u2019s about how you feel about each other. She probably feels like she is a mum to these kids, in the way she feels for them and the role in their lives, but that what she is to them is never acknowledged. If you completely deny her anything to do with being their mum, that\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s sort of ungrateful. \n\nSo yes you should be taking time to honour and remember their late mother. And she should be allowing that. But do you ever do the same for the other woman in their lives who has raised them and loves them like a mother? Being a mother isn\u2019t just about being on the birth certificate or what you call someone. \n\nI suspect a lot of the conflict here can be dealt with by making that time and effort to appreciate the woman that has been there for all of you for many years, and making her feel special, without compromising what you do to honour and remember their late mother.", "Why can\u2019t you do both, honor their deceased mom and honor Claire who is financially and emotionally investing in this family unit including the kids. You seem oddly cold and dismissive of Claire. \n\nWhy couldn\u2019t Mother\u2019s Day start with you all going to breakfast at the diner and the grave and then later on taking Claire out to a nice dinner or an outing.", "I think the relationship you set with your kids and wife is fine, however I think you should be celebrating part of Mother\u2019s Day with your wife. Whether or not you view her as the mother of your kids doesn\u2019t matter. Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day is a day to celebrate parenthood. Since she is your wife you should be doing something small for her like dinner. Especially if all this time she\u2019s been treating your kids well. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s hurt you don\u2019t do anything for her on Mother\u2019s Day despite her being a mother herself. Also I think it\u2019s easy to set terms like you did at the beginning of a relationship but feelings change overtime. At the time where she didn\u2019t know your children that well it might have been fine. However upon getting to know them and help raising them she feels more maternal love for them.", "Be kind. People change. The person you married and promised you all those things is not the same person now.", "My man; my ex fiancee broke off a lengthy engagement very suddenly. She has two incredible kids. I'm still close to them because of THEIR father. He called me a few weeks after the breakup and wanted me to stay in their lives because the kids had immense love for me (which is mutual). He said they called me second dad. \n\nYour kids know Claire better than they do their mother. She's been there for them all their lives. Your kids can have more than one \"Mom\". It isn't replacing, it is adding. Love is NOT zero sum. I agree with her, and i think you can do all the above! So why not incorporate everyone, loving, living and departed, into the family? Your kids are taking their lead from you, so they're going to tell you what you want to hear. It's up to you but if you want to keep your current family you need to make room for the uncredited role Claire has played, and thank her for it.", "Or forced to be the kids caretaker because dad is a deadbeat.", "She can have different feelings, but that doesn't mean she's entitled to get what she wants from minor children by going behind their father's back (who she's been lying to about her own son) and guilt tripping them.\n\nA change in desires didn't do that. A lack of boundaries and respect for those children as autonomous beings did. This woman is self centered and dangerous.", "They met 5 years ago and she doesn\u2019t do anything like cooking and cleaning as OP does that, she does stuff like take them to the pool or watches tv with them. She doesn\u2019t have a parental role in anyway", "She can have a full relationship with the man who **asked her to marry him**. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need her to be his mother either.", "OP, I think you've done right by your kids.  There are so many stories here of parents and stepparents who try to force a nuclear family and the kids hate it and grow to resent both the stepparent and the bio parent.  \n\nYou've allowed your kids to define the relationship and they're the ones who are most important in this situation.  \n\nThey were 11 and 12 when you got married - old enough that accepting another parent would have been a big ask.  You've got their backs and I think that's great.\n\nMaybe your wife should seek some therapy about her relationship with her son and see if there's anything she can do to repair it.", "Okay but I feel like you're ignoring what OP is saying, and has said about three times now: The children do not *want* anything more with their step parent.\n\nI agree that \"parent\" can be defined in ways other than \"bio parent\". Trust me, if anyone knows that, I do. I've had like four different parents and about seven guardians. But according to OP, the children currently *have* the relationship that they want with this person. They do not want the step to be an alternate parent. So I'm not sure why you're continuing to push that point when OP has already addressed it.  \nHe is taking his cues from the kids; there is no indication that he's blocking them off from anything, he's literally just not *forcing* them. And that's exactly what he *told* Claire would happen.", "you\u2019re projecting far too much, it\u2019s clear the kids don\u2019t want another motherly figure and that\u2019s fine.", "You\u2019re assuming a lot here. You assume the kids don\u2019t care because their mom died when they were young, but it was several years before their dad started dating so their mom was the only image they had of a mom. They were 10 and 11 when another mom image came in.\n\nWhen it\u2019s reversed and dads are putting pressure on unwilling kids to accept a stepparent as a full parent, everyone jumps down their throats. But that seems to be what you keep suggesting, because even though they DO have a relationship with her and consider her a member of the family and even though he does the majority of the parenting of them, somehow that\u2019s not enough for you? Now she deserves to be called and treated like a mom because she wants to be? Yes, there can be multiple people in mom roles. But that depends on the child and there is no evidence above that they want this and OP is denying them.\n\nWhat there is evidence of is a caring dad who set down clear boundaries before settling down with a partner. That partner then LIED to him about parts of her life, and tried to fill holes in her life with his children, who did not want to be filler and don\u2019t want anything to change. She was MAKING THE GIRLS UNCOMFORTABLE. \n\nYou said NTA, but everything you said after that was taking his partner\u2019s side and telling him how he could do better for her. She is making no attempts to do what is right for him or his children. Why should he have to make his children uncomfortable for someone who is lying to him, pressuring his children, and ignoring his boundaries? \n\nI agree NTA but the rest of what you said is a bad take given the information we have. Especially when OP politely addresses you and you just ignore it and continue to treat him like he\u2019s wrong.", "This comment should be higher. She passed when they were 2 & 3. The only reason they are adamant about who their mom is - is because of you OP. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you decided to remarry.", "I think OP would still have a problem with this. He doesn't see her in a parental role for his children and wouldn't like the insinuation that they should celebrate together as co-parents, or having her be celebrated.\n\nParent's day *sounds* like it might be less upsetting for him then having her around on mother's day, but I think he's pretty clear that she needs to be separated from being a parental model in his home, because that 'slot' is still occupied by megsie. \n\nRecognizing Claire as anything but a family friend he's married to would be uncomfortable for OP and explicitly against his initial stated boundary all these years.\n\nIt's a nice thought, though.", "That's what I was thinking too, everyone do their own celebration, and then gather for a group dinner.  \n\nI think it's a good thing OP didn't try to replace their mom or force the kids' feelings on that, but I think he may have even pushed a little too far in the opposite direction, if he's saying she has no parental role.  She does, she's their step mother, and it sounds like they get along fine.  I'm sure she's done a lot for the kids over the years, and acknowledging her ALSO on Mother's Day is fine.  I also did stuff for my godmother that day, she didn't have children herself but was a mother figure to me.", "OP is the one that elected to hammer the thought into the kids that their dead mom will be their only mom since they were 2 and 3. That\u2019s pretty young I mean how much do they realistically even remember of her? I get suffering from loss but I find it hard to believe that if OP moved on more healthily the kids would be more open to another mother-like figure in their life. NTA but he also bought this upon himself", "The way OP only responds to comments that agree with him is a major red flag. At the very least, this sub is split on the issue and he should be considering his part in causing this situation.", "My parents separated when I was very very young. I have no memories of them together. \n\nMy mom remarried when I was 5, and I never really accepted my stepdad as my dad. I never even accepted my mom as my mom, lol. \n\nAnyway, my dad remarried when I was 7. I never called her mom, or even stepmom. She was always Nancy to me. It took me quite a few years to trust her fully. My mom worked hard to make sure I never saw Nancy as a mom. It\u2019s still weird to me thinking of her as \u201cmom\u201d but for all intensive purposes - she is. I\u2019m almost 30 now and I go to Nancy for everything, we have a bond I have always wanted and she healed my inner child longing for a parent. \n\nHas OP even asked his kids what *they* want? \n\nThey don\u2019t need to call her mom. A second parent doesn\u2019t replace the ones they once had. Just like a second wife doesn\u2019t erase the first one. \n\nAgain, all of my \u201creal\u201d parents were so emotionally messy, once I had my own kids it clicked that they all made choices to act like that. I don\u2019t talk to my real dad, barely speak to my mom and stepdad, but I\u2019m incredibly close to Nancy.", "When I was younger, my mom's boyfriend at the time never tried to be my dad. He did a lot for me and with me, though. When you live with your partner and their kid, you're gonna end up being a parental figure. Even if parenting decisions are made by their bio/legal parent. I find it incredibly hard to believe she doesn't interact with them much when they live together.", "According to him, he took on just about everything household and kid wise. Now he could be lying, but that's true of any post; just defaulting to that is cynical. So for now, we go with the info provided by him. I'm sure that there was at least a few times over four years that she cooked for them or picked up after them (leaving toys in a common room or something) but the rule and flow of the house has been Dad taking care of child related things.\n\nAs for the wife aspect, we don't know how he treats her as a romantic partner, just as an adult in his children's lives, because that's the focus of the post. Therapy and getting to the bottom of why she did what she did was his first reaction, which indicates to me he is communicative and understanding. It doesn't say he cussed her out or something like that. He was upset but open to hearing her side. \n\nHe made a clear boundary around his kids based on a discussion with them. He was ready to date and find a relationship, that doesn't mean his kids have to have any relationship with her at all. But instead they have a aunt/close female relative relationship. Just because that doesn't come with the sort of mother-child relationship she wants doesn't mean it's not a valid and fulfilling relationship for the kids. If she was having issues with this she should have talked to him beforehand. Fulfilling a parental role comes from more than just happening to marry someone's dad or mom. It has to be with consent and willingness from the kids' side room. So no, no parental role here, just a familial one. Which is okay. My dad has been with his girlfriend for 15 years and I have never once thought of her as my mom. And that's okay, we're family and care for each other, but she's not my mom. At 15 and 16, the kids definitely get to take the lead about what role Claire plays in their lives and from even before then, they said \"we don't want a new mom\".", "I thought the same. So many posts where men pawn the kids off, remarry quickly, try to force new moms and alienate the kids. He set expected boundaries to not force relationships and kept his regular traditions with the kids. \n\nHe was also used to single parenting for a long time so I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not easy to suddenly share the reins with someone else.", "I mean I have a mom and a stepmom. They're both family and I have a great relationship with both of them, but my stepmom isn't my mom and never will be. We are close but she knows she doesn't play mom to me. She's still a parental figure but she has her own, third slot. Doesn't mean we don't have a meaningful relationship just because I don't consider her my mom", "Agree, Claire needs to get out. Was she also an A H for her actions? Yes. But this is not a healthy relationship for her.", "Good lord. Do they braid each others hair and make friendship bracelets too? \n\nDriving them to the mall or watching tv with them - Those ARE parental things. They\u2019re not bffs, they are an adult spending time with children in the home they share. Did Claire at any point have any conversation with them about menstruation? About boys, or girls, or help them navigate any social troubles at school? She must have helped with homework once or twice? What about talking about their plans for college, or what they want to do in life?  \n\nBecause I\u2019ve got a real big reality sized cheque for you to cash, mate.", ">You were very upfront about what you and your kids needed and wanted. She agreed going in with this plan. Then she tried change things by going behind your back by guilty tripping your kids and then trying to manipulate you. Not ok.\n\nThis is the crux of OP's argument.  OP was transparent with Claire from the beginning as to what her role would be if she chose to marry.  If she didn't like it, she shouldn't have tied the knot.", "There are words for such caregivers in kids' lives, but they never replace \"mother\" or \"father\". These words apply to those who literally gave them life, and this often is quite sacred in most cultures.\n\nYou don't force these words on people who feel uncomfortable using them towards you. To do so is not only selfish, it's extremely inconsiderate towards the people whom you are causing discomfort and their memory of the person who doesn't have agency or ability to advocate for themselves (in this case, due to death).", "I think it's important to point out that she might not even have reacted this way if OP did a better job being her husband. OP in this post doesn't sound like a husband to her at all. \n\nHe says he loves his late wife and how amazing she was far more than how amazing his current wife is. In fact in all the comments he almost sounds very rude in explaining how she doesn't cook or clean and all she does is have fun with the kids and takes them to have fun stuff. As if this wasn't something which is a result of OP's own choice. \n\nIt was him who wanted her to not be their mom, it was his idea to not let her be part of their life as another parental figure. She simply complied with his wishes. Now she is in a very low place and wants her family to comfort her and OP here is going all out at her. \n\nThis whole family doesn't even sound like her family. And they technically are. She sounds more like a friends with benefits person for OP then a wife. \n\nHonestly, the kids are teenagers. OP could have sat down and talked to the kids about how his wife's relationship with her son is strained and how she is missing him for mother's day so how about after they go pay respect to his late wife and go to the cafe they can also do something nice for Claire as Claire has always been nice to them too. This would have solved everything but nope. \n\nOP is the biggest AH. If Claire is reading this, please leave this man and find someone who truly deeply loves you. Who puts you first and not secondary to his late wife.", "I disagree. The kids have a mom and a mothers day ritual that is very important. Disrupting the ritual is a huge issue.   If her issue was more along the lines of hey- can you help me foster a better relationship with my stepkids. No problem! Totally legit. But replacing a ritual of significance is not okay.  \n\nSounds like there are other issues at hand. But let's say I have a ritual with my kids where I take them out for breakfast close to their birthday. I get remarried and their step mom wants me to stop taking them out to breakfast and instead make a fancy breakfast at home as she had that ritual with her mom. I would say- wow cool idea, no I am not replacing my ritual. But what if we did a birthday breakfast celebration at the house as well?", "I\u2019m not advocating to force that word on them at all. Meggie is their mom but who has been the maternal presence for them?

They've had children since, but their lives are built around this constant mourning. Grave visits, presents at Christmas for someone who isn't there, and the new children are told about their older sibling, whom they never met, nor will meet.\n\nThey're also feeling the pressure of this \"perfect child\" who's now judged on all the potential of who they could have become... The parents are timid, as is the oldest child, and there's a sombre reverence to them.\n\nNow, I'm not saying your situation is anything like that.

I'm merely observing that it wasn't their choice. You've raised them to revere the dead, which means they risk living a life of mourning, and looking back. Not ahead.\n\nI'm sorry for bringing this up, I've just seen what it's doing to the children in my extended family. They're not remembering their brother. They never knew him.

She had primary custody and she would frequently talk badly about my stepmom around me. It was subtle, I was young, and I trusted my mom's judgment and word on everything.  I felt loyal to my mom, so for a while, I really hated my stepmom. I hated her not because she was a bad person, but because it was obvious my mom did, so I thought I should too. Looking back I can't tell you a single thing she did to me personally to make me hate her. But I could tell my mom didn't like her, so neither did I.\n\nAs I got older, I started to figure out how my mom reacts to things. Which meant I started to form my own opinions of my stepmom. It wasn't until I was a teenager that I actually started to realize my stepmom was really not a bad person. Actually, I really liked her. But I was terrified of my mom thinking I wasn't loyal to her or didn't love her. Because she always made comments about how it would break her heart if I lived with my dad and how I was not allowed to call my stepmom anything other than her name. My mom took care of me, and the last thing I wanted to do was 'betray' her by actually liking my stepmom and thinking of her as a mom.\n\nI'm in my 30s now, and I actually have a closer relationship with my stepmom than my mom. For many reasons. However, if I had not started to really process how my mom's behavior and words colored my relationship with my stepmom, I think I would have continued to want nothing to do with her. Which would have been a shame because it's a relationship I now highly value.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP is very obviously still grieving the loss of his late wife, which is fine. But the kids are at an age where they can pick up on that. So, again speaking from experience, I can see the kids wanting to protect Dad and his grief. They probably know that Dad would be upset if they changed the tradition on Mother's Day. So even though they may be open to the idea, and open to seeing Claire as a stepmom, they will never verbalize that while they think it could hurt their dad's feelings.\n\nI don't think any of this is done intentionally.

It's hysterical that he is projecting that Claire needs it when in fact he and his children should get into ASAP to undo the damage he has done to them. \n\nInstead of real, loving, meaningful relationship with living person he instead forced them to worship a *ghost...*", ">I completely get what you are saying and your bring up some good points, but Claire isn\u2019t crying out for more from op but from his minor children. These kids lost their mum so young and it seems like they do have a great relationship with Claire all things considered but they just don\u2019t see her as a mother. That\u2019s completely fine, I get her feelings but they don\u2019t in any way trump the feelings of the kids in this. They have already expressed to op that they are uncomfortable with Claire pushing and don\u2019t want to change the dynamic.\n\nThe fact the OP felt it necessary to say \"my therapist agrees with me\" makes everything the OP says about what his kids want suspect imo. Therapists try to get people to see both sides, not take sides themselves. Either he's building this fantasy in his head of the boundaries he set and that everyone agrees with him or he's got an ethically questionable therapist... Assuming he's been seeing the same therapist for the last 10+ years, I guess I cant completely rule out the later considering the hang-ups and unresolved issues he still clearly has over his late wife who passed over a decade ago and the therapist is still happy taking his money and hasn't referred him to another therapist where he might actually make progress... but that seems like a big assumption.\n\nEven to the extent that the kids dont want that type of relationship with Claire, I'd question how much of it was organically coming from the kids and how much of it was indoctrination by the father; especially now.\n\nThey dont know their biological-birth mother other than by what dad tells them. And they spent almost a decade before meeting Claire going through a ritualistic visiting of their mother's grave at mothers day and being told how great a women she was and how no one will ever replace her... and they've spent the last 5 years continuing that ritual despite the presence of Clair in their lives. \n\nI just find it very hard to believe that 2 pre-teen girls entered their teen years and havent wanted for a mother figure in their lives at any point along the way.\n\nThey're living with a ghost. A spectre no one will ever measure up to.", "I\u2019m sorry you had that experience. I had a similar experience. My parents divorced, but only my father remarried. My mom was very negative about my step mom and any hint of me liking my step mom was considered betrayal of my bio mom. My bio mom would actually say she wanted me to have a relationship with my step mom, but she\u2019d always find ways to discourage it or show her disapproval, so it was easier to stay distant. I have a much better relationship with my step mom now, but sometimes I wonder how close we could have been if I didn\u2019t reject her for so long to please my mom. I would love another maternal figure in my life.\n\nI know I have a bias from my personal experience that affects how I interpret OPs situation. I\u2019m sure for every example of someone who wishes they were closer to step family, there\u2019s someone who was happy to stay distant. That\u2019s why I think independent and family therapy is necessary.\n\nAnd I agree, I don\u2019t think it is intentional. I think OP is grieving. And this boundary feels like a way to honor their mother. And I don\u2019t think Claire should be shoved into the role of mother but she should be allowed to do parental acts of care and let the relationship develop into whatever it will be. It sound like there is a lot of pressure on everyone to not let Claire do anything that could be interpreted as maternal.\n\nTeens can be very independent thinkers, but they are also influenced by their parents in many ways. It is easy to pass on trauma, even with the best intentions. If the children get unbiased counsel and still want these boundaries, that should be honored. But I strongly think the children need unbiased counsel to make the decision.", "The children were 10 and 11 when they met his wife, they have known hermfor 5 years. I'm not sure they were robbed of anything. Would not the majority of people consider  that someone they met at that age is not their mother? She is family to them though, I don't see the problema. Plus OP said she did not the parenting.", "I think I'm the arsehole now for laughing at \"cult of Meggie\"", "I really wouldn't be surprised if OP insisted on doing all of the parenting himself. I could see him telling Claire not to pick them up or make them dinner, so they could view him as the sole parental figure. OP should not have gotten married. He is clearly not in a position to give himself 100% to Claire, nor does he want to. What's the famous Princess Diana quote? \"There were three people in this marriage\"", "The kids don't remember her, she's not a loved one to them. She's a concept, this magic thing that they will never know. He created a tragedy and made it bigger by compounding it every year. The gravesite visits should be when they ask to go, not when he says. He should let them move on. He didn't need to make this as big as he did for them. He did it because his own grief was so huge, not because *their* grief was huge. \n\nNow if they were ten and twelve and *knew* her it would be absolutely appropriate. But they don't. It would be like visiting your grandmother's grave every year on her birthday if she died before you were born. At some point, you probably want to do other things on that day.", "My aunt died the day her son was born, leaving her husband with a newborn, an 18 year old daughter, and a 4 year old daughter. All three of her children have different relationships with their stepmother, but she did become a mother to all of them one way or another - all while helping my uncle keep their bio mom's memory alive in a way tailored for each of them. Young children who likely don't even remember their real mother don't need to have her held over their heads like a restless ghost their whole lives. That's not healthy for anyone involved.", "I hope the second part of my message didn't come across as me not agreeing with you. I absolutely do. I just wanted to make it clear WHY for those who may not have had a similar experience to ours. Because people don't seem to understand that kids and teenagers can pick up on these things and absolutely just say what they know their parents want to hear. It's a protection and coping mechanism for dealing with trauma, and it's usually subconscious!  \n\n\nI'm sorry we both had to deal with this growing up. It's a prime example of why everyone should be in therapy, lol.", "100% to all of this. I\u2019m not even sure he likes Claire. There is nothing wrong with honoring the memory of his first wife, but his tone through all of this toward Claire is just cold. Unfeeling. Uncaring of her feelings. Claire has no chance to capture even a small portion of his heart because it is completely  owned by someone who in death has become superwoman.", "Thank you.  You didn't deserve to go through that either.  And I couldn't have said it better about accepting whatever crumbs were offered because of already being invested. It was indeed such a dark time for me too. Just typing that up brought back some big feels, and I haven't even talked to him in several years and have moved on to a (much healthier) relationship.", "I think for me it veers into \"dangerous\" any time an adult feels entitled to get their needs met through a child.\n\nHer wanting that and feeling hurt that her stepkids don't feel the same way is all entirely human and valid.\n\nThe moment she thinks it's okay to guilt trip them, go behind her partner's back to do so, and then once he finds out she doubles down and asks him to \"encourage them to at least try\" instead of just accepting the very clear \"no\" she was given is what makes me feel like she could potentially be dangerous.\n\nParents and step parents have so much power over children. The moment they feel like it's okay to objectify a child for their own needs is the moment abuse becomes extremely likely.", "Well, OP is treating her like a bystander. And I feel like this is so much bigger than a Mother's Day ritual. \n\nI feel sorry for Claire. I get that she agreed to this when they got married, but reality sometimes plays out differently. It must be awful to always be on the outside looking in and to be reminded every day, through words and deeds, that she's just the consolation prize.\n\nI don't think OP needs to \"erase\" Meggie or give up their remembrances/rituals, but it seems like his boundaries are so absolute and immobile I don't know how anyone could be happy living like that.\n\nOP, I'm sorry for your loss but I agree with other folks here that you were not ready to remarry. YTA.", "op sounds super selfish to me. I hope Claire can find the family she needs", "I'm honestly not sure why he even remarried.", "They have only known Claire for 5 years. As a child with a deceased father I can say, after 5 years someone can feel like family, but as a parent? The children are at an age where they can say what they want and feel, it is done here as if the children are very young and Clair has been part of their lives for years. That is not true. And even if she was, it is not she who decides whether she will get the \"mother role,\" but the children. You can't force love.", "I feel sorry for everyone here. They\u2019re all being held emotionally hostage, even OP, to a ghost.\n\nNot a single bit of this is healthy", "This needs more upvotes.", "Yeah, it\u2019s like someone that was brought up in the Christian faith saying they chose Christianity when in reality they never looked at other religions because of the early indoctrination.", "I also wonder if she tried to discuss this with OP beforehand and got shut down so she went to the kids because maybe she cares about what they *actually* want rather than what OP has told them they want.\n\nMy biological father was never around but I had an absolutely amazing step-dad. Literally could not have asked for a better father, as far as I'm concerned, he is the Dad that all other Dads should be judged by. He moved in when I was 4 and died when I was 13. One of my very biggest regrets was that I never called him Dad. I don't know why I didn't, I idolized the man. He was kind, warm, funny, loving. I was closer to him than my actual Mother. I fear that there might come a time when these kids regret never calling her Mom or acknowledging all that she's doing for them as a Mom while not getting credit.", "He's trying to act like he's doing what his kids want, without realising he's been manipulating how they think from the get go.

Claire came into the family 4 years ago, and last year she started to suggest the kids to drop the tradition and celebrate with her, because she started to lose connection with her own son.\n\nI rate this as an A H move. She could ask for any other day, but she wants *that one just for her.*", "Doing a lot of the \u201cfun\u201d stuff \u2014 taking them places, spending time with them regularly *is* parenting. So is talking. Most of the important parenting in the teens is talking.\n\nBecause that takes effort and time, time they could be spending just for themselves, and a non-parent can and would be justified to choose to do *none* of that.\n\nThe fact that her involvement is characterized as completely \u201cnot parental\u201d is kind of strange, especially if it\u2019s regular. A step *parent* obligates themselves to do at least some of this, when they could be doing anything else, because they\u2019re a step *parent*. \n\nThey\u2019re watching the kids and keeping them alive and entertained for stretches at a time. Any way they contribute that takes the active load away from the birth parent so that they\u2019re not experiencing the entire burden of single parenthood IS parenting! Or else it\u2019s just transactional babysitting in exchange for emotional and physical intimacy.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy for the family or kids to actively frame her relational contributions as non-parental, even if it\u2019s not the same as a typical birth parent. That has to mess with dynamics assuming this story is true, and while her way of handling it seems problematic, the feelings she has might be caused by the rigid enforcement of the situation, and what seems to be an active effort to preclude her from getting any \u201cparental\u201d label and thus credit, because it\u2019s a non-starter in OP\u2019s framework.", "> She gets to do the fun stuff like take them to the pool or the arcade or to relax and watch TV with them.\n\nThat's all stuff I did growing up with my mom...

If he's not over his previous wife, that's totally fine, but it's a horrible decision going into a relationship with someone else when you're not over someone. His conditions he set were conditions you'd put on a casual relationship, not something like marriage.

I wish Happy Mother's Day to my mom, my ex-MIL, my MIL, my friends that are mom's, and other family members that are moms, my grandmothers when they were still alive, as they all do for me. Cards and flowers are exchanged between a few of us as well.  \n\nSo because of my experience, I find the rigidity of not celebrating *anyone* but your own mother strange, tbh. I have no idea if your stepmother/father's wife was also a mother of her own children, but if she was did you refuse to say HMD, or acknowledge the day for her in some way at all? Or was the fact that she was a mother to others (if she was) addressed in a \"token way\"?", "Right! And I imagine any parent would want someone else to nurture and love their kids if they passed away. His wishes are selfish and don\u2019t take into account what his kids or Meggie want.", "I would be in agreeance with this if not for the fact that going into this relationship he let his position be known and she agreed to it. He didn't force this on her, he did it in the best way and let her know early on the deal and she made her decision. If the kids truly wanted something different why did his youngest come to him and let him know that she is trying to get them to change their plans?", ">I can\u2019t believe so many people think this women isn\u2019t allowed to ask for a full relationship from a man who asked her to marry him\n\nThis doesn't make sense. Why does she expect this now? When the man clearly outlined this was not possible before they got married? Why is it ok to ask for something that was clearly mentioned as not possible?\n\nShe could've said no before the marriage. She can even say no now and move on. But why do people expect him to budge on something he stated was a necessary need for him before the marriage?", "I think Claire did think she'd be ok with it and had every intention of not wanting to step on toes, but with time and experience, feelings change. I think 5 years of being treated like an aunt or being part of the family, but never REALLY being part of the family, finally took its toll on her. She was the AH for going to the kids instead of OP, but like the comment above stated, why would she go to OP when he's clearly still living in the shadow of his wife's death? The kids were too young to even remember their mom, so everything they've learned they learned from OP. It's doesn't surprise me that he instilled, \"Meggie is your mom and will always be your only mom\" into them because he isn't open to letting Claire be a bonus mom to them. That's what they've been raised with, and any deviation or changed feelings from the kids could result in them disappointing their dad, so they'll do anything to obey him. ESH.", "The kids are the ones who told OP she was making them uncomfortable.", "Based on the edit, she met his kids when they were 10 and 11, which is definitely old enough to not want her to be their mother territory (which at that age could go either way, but they were definitely old enough to make that decision).\n\nI do agree that they didn't really get to know her because of how young she died. I don't think keeping her memory alive is a bad thing. Maybe they could go to her grave on the anniversary of her death and do something with the family on mother's day, or some other similar compromise.", "Nor sure if Meggie would want this devout devotee like behaviour you\u2019ve inculcated in her kids. You\u2019re essentially depriving them of a living mother figure by having them \u201c worship\u201d and pedestalize their late mother. According to you, she passed away 12-13 years ago, when the kids were 2-3. Given how you\u2019re completely unwilling to move on from your late wife (which is your personal decision), it\u2019s no surprise that the children that you\u2019ve raised, solo, have adopted your fanatic devotee approach towards their late mother. They don\u2019t know anything better. \n\nThey NEVER had a choice. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a mother who is present. \n\nAll this has nothing to do with your current wife. Just pointing out something you\u2019ve done intentionally or unintentionally.", "This is my thinking as well. It may really be OP projecting this into his kids as they were so young when she died. What would they have wanted if this narrative wasn't being pushed by OP so hard. \n\nMy Mum died when I was 10 and my brother was 8. My Dad met my Step-Mum when I was about 15 but I  had moved out at 17 before she moved in and they later married. She had two young children (2 and 3) at the time. \n\nI call them my \"parents\" but don't call her Mum. She is a wonderful, supportive figure in my life who I love dearly an it doesn't at all take away from my memory of my Mum. My relationship with her daughters would be much more like an Aunt figure. My brother however does consider her a Mum and and her daughter his sisters. \n\nMy reflection of my relationship with my Mum is also of that of a 10 year old and I have no idea how our relationship would have grown as I'm now an adult. \n\nJust on another note. I know there were issues a couple of years into my parents relationship because my Dad was projecting a lot of comparison from my Mum onto my \"step-Mum\". I must be really hard when there is no end or closure on a relationship unlike a separation or divorce  Reflection after death is usually always in the best light. My Step-Mum felt like she couldn't live up to the image my Dad had of my Mum. He worked though that with counselling. The way OP speaks about his wife, I worry that Claire is also feeling that way.", "As someone whose parent died when I was young, slightly older than them, I don't remember much. I miss the idea of my parent more than I actually miss them. I grieved for them, but I was too young to actually have formed a relationship that I remember.", "Nta. I got divorced when my son was too young to remember his father and remarried shortly after that. I had the same \u201cwhat will be your role\u201d talk with my second husband and we agree to co-parent as equals. My son, like your daughters doesn\u2019t remember his father, but he is not a taboo subject and growing up, I made sure my son knew about the man who fathered him. My second husband is not my son\u2019s father, but he is his parent and I am adamant about making sure he gets the respect he is due as a co-parent. My biggest question after reading this is Claire your wife or your co-parent, because those are two different roles within a family and it may be something you need to clarify with each other before you proceed.", "It sounds like this was doomed from the start. Admittedly I\u2019m judging by very little background here; I can\u2019t help feeling though the worship of your deceased wife was perpetuated by you. It was placed on the children. The fact is they have absolutely no memory of her. If they claim to have any, it was planted. It\u2019s not the \u201cmother slot\u201d issue that rises to the top here though. It\u2019s the fact that you established in the beginning that someone who is deceased is of greater importance in all of your lives than the new wife could ever be. She should have recognized this and not have accepted a life where she would always be second place to a memory.", "I\u2019m so confused, why can\u2019t you do both? Spend some time doing the things Meggie loved with your children, and then do something with Claire that evening? It doesn\u2019t have to be so black and white or segregated, you CAN incorporate Claire without replacing Meggie", "OP I am so so sorry for your loss. Meggie must have been a wonderful woman and I am sorry all your dreams of the future with her were taken away from you.\n\nBut I have to say as a former nanny that I had more of a parental role towards the children I nannied for than Claire seems to have. I guess that was her choice though? Or maybe you made it more than clear that you won't allow her to ever parent your children (because you think the memory of Meggie will be lost? ) so she had no choice but to agree.", "Your wife may have been fine with the arrangement at the beginning, but for her, things have changed.  That part's not your fault, but you're so unyielding, that you might end up losing her.  She shouldn't've made your kids uncomfortable with her requests, but you should've at least listened to your wife.  I think that putting your late wife on a pedestal is unhealthy for everyone involved.  Perhaps your kids could've had an okay relationship with your wife if you had let it happen.  And honestly, having a decent mother/child relationship with a live stepmom is better than just talking and reminiscing about a mom who's no longer with them.  Soft YTA.", "NTA, but I sure wouldn't want to be your new wife either. Just being honest, it sounds pretty awful. Perhaps you weren't actually ready to re marry.", "I think YTA.  I am surprised at the N T As. First, people change. Someone can agree to something in the beginning of the relationship but it's not a legal contract. People change. Feelings evolve. \n\nSecond, you seem weirdly PROUD that you put Meggie first year after year after year. As someone said, that seems incredibly lonely for Claire.   It is not cool that she went to the kids, that's shitty and clearly made the kids uncomfortable, but it's not enough for an E S H.  \n\nIt's fine you still love Meggie but you seem to parade it as a point of pride and identity rather than it just being part of who you are. Like you're determined to live in this frozen amber of time instead of evolve and let your love for Meggie to take a different form.\n\nI don't think you should have married Claire. I think you are using Claire to fulfill some of your needs while keeping her eternally in the waiting room of your life.  That sucks.  The fact that the therapist agrees with you makes me sad.  I see no effort on your part to understand or empathize with Claire, who is actually there, and actually loves your family: you'd rather go \"aha! but you AGREED! I CAUGHT YOU CHEATING ON YOUR WORD!\" .  Like, why? \n\nFinally, this commitment to graveside visits year after year after year on Mothers day -- especially since the kids were so young they don't remember her?  That's you making sure your kids\u2014and Claire\u2014know where their loyalty should lie.  \n\nYou clearly have real grief but it's all mucked up in this performative controlling grief. And the thing is, with this path you're taking (\"Meggie will always come first\"), you won't heal.  Not stop loving your first wife, but actually heal. Because a*ctually* processing your grief would mean you'd have to let go of things you don't want to let go of, and my guess is that is way too painful.", "ESH.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to use your kids to fulfill a fantasy because her son isn\u2019t good enough for her. I feel like nobody is acknowledging that. She HAS a son, he\u2019s just not exactly what she expected. What she wants isn\u2019t fair on your kids or hers.\n\nThe kids were 2 and 3. They probably have, what, one or two memories of their mother at most? Their mother is only a big part of their life because you\u2019re projecting. You\u2019re taking them to the grave of a woman they\u2019ve never met, eating at the diner she took them to \u201call the time\u201d that they probably don\u2019t even remember. Claire might be using your kids but so are you. Instead of grieving your loss in a healthy way, you\u2019re creating this fictional relationship between them and their mother that didn\u2019t exist. Instead of them grieving in whatever way is best for them, you\u2019re dragging it out and forcing them to grieve who is essentially a stranger to them. You are forcing your own grief, your own memories onto them. They shouldn\u2019t feel responsible to grieve for you.\n\nYou all need family therapy.", "Claire is a mother. I always thought Mother\u2019s Day was to celebrate all mothers, not just bio mothers. Why not acknowledge Claire and give her a card to let her know she matters.", "YTA\n\nWhat the kids want is largely influenced by what you're telling them and how you're acting about the situation.\n\nIn a couple of years those kids will have little to no memory of their older mother, if be surprised if now their memories weren't pretty much all what you're telling them they are.\n\nIf they don't want to see Claire like a mother it's likely because you're telling them (even if indirectly) that they shouldn't.", "For future reference (I promise I\u2019m not trying to be snarky), it\u2019s \u201cfor all intents AND purposes,\u201d not \u201cfor all intensive purposes.\u201d\n\nAgain, I\u2019m really not trying to be snarky or rude. You have such a well-written comment, so I figured you might be interested in this bit of information."]}
