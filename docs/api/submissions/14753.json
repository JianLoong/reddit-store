I have two children with my late wife who are 15 and 16. Claire has a grown son in his 20s. My late wife was Meggie and I still love her and always will. She passed when our kids were 2 and 3 years old. We had talked about the possibility of it happening because she had a job where she put herself at risk to help others. She is still very much part of our story. When I was ready to date again I went into it with some basic points that needed to be okay with a potential partner. Those were; I was not looking for a mother for my children, they have a mother and did not want a relationship where they called someone else mom (yes we talked about it), Meggie would always be part of the picture and any partner of mine had to be okay with that, Meggie would not be forgotten or erased just because I was ready to date. I also did not want to have more children. When Claire and I met she told me all of that was good with her because she had a grown son and did not want to start over and she respected that I still loved my late wife. She and my kids got along so I felt good about our relationship.\n\nThings were good until last year when my youngest told me Claire had been making them uncomfortable around Mother's Day and that she had requested that my child suggest a change of plans and we do something for her that Mother's Day. Claire was always with her son while the kids and I would visit Meggie's grave, go out for lunch at the diner Meggie and I took them to while she was alive and we'd chill afterward. Claire wanted us to drop that and never said a thing to me. I brought it up to her and she told me she felt it was time the kids and I joined her and her son for Mother's Day and embrace the person who is here. I told her she was celebrating with her son while my kids and I were remembering and honoring their mom. She was very closed off and I told her we needed to speak to a therapist because I could see there was more going on.\n\nIt's taken this long but from February she has been opening up and saying how she does want my kids to view her as a mother and how she isn't okay with how things are with them seeing her as family but not a parent and with how much Meggie is still part of things. She also admitted her relationship with her son is not what she has pretended it to be and how she wanted a chance to have a closer adult relationship with my kids and to be the mom of an adult she always thought she would be. I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish when they are not wanting to be part of that. She told me if I loved her I would encourage them to at least try and that I said that to her in a very dismissive way. She told me I was being rude for the sake of rude.

The thing is: kids can have more than one kind of parent in their lives. Rather than focus on \u201cnever replacing their bio mum\u201d You could encourage the three of them to form a different kind of relationship - one where she\u2019s a trusted adult in their lives without erasing the presence of your late wife. \n\nI can tell you love your kids. I also wonder if their reluctance to embrace Claire comes from a place of not wanting to disappoint you. They were really little when Meggie died and aren\u2019t likely to remember much about her, but they instinctively understand your position on this.", "Let Claire cool off for a bit. Maybe if her relationship with her son is going through a rough patch she's just feeling super emotional and vulnerable. \n\nEither way, definitely NTA.", "NTA, she should have brought it up with you rather than making a demand of your children. Also changing a tradition like that, if not initiated by the children themselves can be quite hurtful. Put your kids first, in whatever decision they make.", "NTA", "**NTA**. Claire changed the ENTIRE dynamic without telling you, HER PARTNER.  And YOU are rude?  NOPE, changing shit midstream IS rude.", "As someone who was the kid in of your dynamic... NTA!!\n\nMy mom died when I was 3, my sister was 4 and my brother was 1. Our dad stayed single for a few years and focused on us, making sure mom was still remembered and giving us a good childhood. It was almost a decade later when he met someone he wanted to date and like you, he spoke to us first. We didn't want her to step in and fill a mom role in our lives and he supported us with that. Our feelings did not change and today we are in our 30s and she is family but she's not and has never been our parent. She is not celebrated by us on Mother's Day and we do not form a traditional nuclear family. My siblings and I are glad our dad let us define things and kept mom alive for us. It's what we would all want with our kids. I'm sorry she's no longer okay with things. But you are not wrong for sticking by what you and your kids want.\n\nMy dad told us he is still mom's widower while being his wife's husband also. It's something not everyone will understand. Normally the second spouse having kids helps with it not being such a negative. But some people really feel you need to let go of the late parent/spouse to healthily move on. But there is a way to treasure them and accept a different relationship with someone new. It's just something that requires understanding of the loss.", "NTA but Claire is very manipulative. \"If you love me, you'll...\" what? Try and force your kids to forget their mother?\nNo. Cut that shit right now. \nClaire is looking to be called \"Mom\". Please take a minute to read the reddit tales of stepparents like her. It never ends well. \nIf Claire continues to be this manipulative, kick her to the curb.", "ESH.\n\nAs much as I respect you not trying to replace your late wife in your kid's lives, sounds to me like your late wife takes way to much space in your marriage. \n\nThere are a lot more issues in your marriage than your wife and her relationship with the 3 kids.", "NTA\n\nBut you, your kids, and Claire need to understand that there is plenty of room for her in their lives without her replacing their mom. They can still be very close and have a nurturing (mutually beneficial) relationship without her being, or replacing their late mom.", "Let's look at it from your wife's perspective\n\nI assume her son does not live with you and therefore she is surrounded by a 'family' who do not want to completely let her in. Add to that her relationship with her son is not good so she's feeling isolated and an outsider\n\nShe might also be looking at the reverence you hold your late wife in. Jealously would be natural\n\nI can appreciate she wants to feel closer to all of you but she can't transfer her failing relationship with her son to be replaced by your kids\n\nEqually she needs to see she is going to be let into the fold a bit more\n\nFor instance do you plan to visit her grave on mother's day in ten years time when your kids have flown the nest? Will you be insisting you all get together for her birthday every year forever more?\n\nI suppose my main question is are you doing this for the kids or yourself? Are you truly over your late wife\n\nSoft ESH - even though your wife knew the rules she is crying out for more and you need to give her something before you ruin the relationship forever", "It seems like a discussion with the whole family would be useful if it is possible in a calm way. Ignoring the Mother's Day issue for now, looking to the future. \n\nClaire should explain to the teenagers that she would like to take a more active role in their lives, that she understands that having only got to know them when they had reached a double digit age, she can't be their mother, but wants to be more than just an adult who lives in the same house. \n\nAt 15 & 16 they are old enough to suggest what they feel comfortable accepting, and what they actively want. Hopefully Claire can let Mother's Day be for Meggie, but you all do something bonding together the day before or after.", "NAH, but it's time to look into some counseling. If you can accept that loving another woman isn't cheating on your wife, you have to accept that her raising your kids isn't making them cheat on their mother. \n\nWhat type of person was Meggie? Would she have demanded that no one else should ever help with raising her kids, or would she have been delighted to know that someone else cared for her children, even if it isn't as much as she did? \n\nBecause at the end of the day, you should be celebrating life. There's no reason you can't visit the gravesite a day before or after. But don't make another person miserable trying to keep your wife happy.", "Okay. \n\nNTA for having the boundary you set at the beginning of the relationship. \n\nNTA for choosing to do your own private thing every Mother\u2019s Day. \n\nNTA for declining to do what Claire wants (though I\u2019m sure it is painful for her).\n\nYTA for saying that Claire was using your kids to fulfill her \u201cwish\u201d.\n\nIt\u2019s not a wish. Your wife, for whatever reason, has a poor relationship with her son, and that sucks; there goes the last of her \u201ctraditional\u201d family unit. She\u2019s probably feeling alone and wants to feel like she\u2019s part of some sort of a family again. So it\u2019s not really a wish; it\u2019s a need of hers. And she\u2019s not \u201cusing\u201d anyone, so much as making a bid for connection.\n\nSo yeah, demoting her needs into a wish, and suggesting she would use your kids to grant it, was probably hurtful. \n\nGranted, her problem is 100% hers to deal with, and you set fair boundaries at the beginning. You don\u2019t have to concede, or force the kids to do something different. In fact you should not. \n\nIMO, make time for the diner and visit Maggie, and also make time for a nice dinner/evening with Claire. See if you can come to an agreement as a family where everyone\u2019s feelings are heard, and needs can be best met.", "ESH  \n\n\nThe relationship between your kids and your wife is for the kids to decide, it is great that Claire wants to be part of their lives, love them and take care of them, that means your kids have someone they can count on and can have a female role model on their lives that is willing to be a positive influence for them, and that means more for them.  \n\n\nBut the kids are to decide how to relate to her and to call her whatever they choose, their Claire, their mom, their stepmom or however they want to incorporate her in a loving way, but it is not something to be forced upon. Kids do need a motherly figure as much as a fatherly figure for a healthy development, if they don't find it on their home, they will find external role models in other places. Claire should be free to relate to your kids as how she wants too, if she wants to be a part to their lives as a motherly figure.\n\nI believe there is more work to do in your family, you are still grieving and maybe in a not so healthy way, it seems to me you carry a big weight that you don't wanna let go, even if you made the effort of moving on and that is ok, it can be a long process, but sometimes we need help to get through it.   \n\n\nThe people we spend our life with will always accompany us, they have left an indelible mark on us, but if their memory disables us from having new healthy relationships and living a satisfying life, then we aren't honoring them as they would wish for us to lead a happy life.  \n\n\nMore than agreeing or disagreeing with any of you both, I would suggest to still go to therapy and possibly try another therapist, one with experience with grief and couple therapy if possible.  \n\n\nI suggest watching this episode of Cinematherapy talking specifically about Co-Parenting, I love this channel and their teachings, I really recommend giving a watch to some of their videos!  \n\n\n[Therapist Reacts: Co-Parenting in KUNG FU PANDA 2 and 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x3iFyL2hf8)", "NTA for setting boundaries. Especially as you have always been clear with her. And she is totally TA for trying to go through your children like this. \n\nBut you sound very dismissive of your wife\u2019s needs and that makes me wonder WHY she felt she couldn\u2019t come to you and tell you that she wanted and needed something different in this family structure. \n\nMother\u2019s Day is about recognition. How long has she functionally been doing the work of a parent in your household without appreciation or recognition?  Is part of what she needs is a Mother\u2019s Day type of tradition that celebrates her role? Call it whatever you want- but it might really help. \n\nIf it has been years- well- relationships naturally evolve. And I wonder how much of your kid\u2019s reluctance to be closer to her is because you are reminding them that she\u2019s not their mom and they don\u2019t want to disappoint you or be disloyal to Meggie by letting Claire in more deeply. I might be totally off base- teenagers will be teenagers and they might keep her at a distance for any number of reasons- but if this resonates- you might want to bring that to your therapist.", "NTA for most of it\nBut YTA when you said: \"I told her she could not use my kids to fulfill her wish\". From what i can understand she dosen't have the best relationship with her son, atleast from her POV. And she's trying to be a mother figure to your kids, so ig she's just feeling left out", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I don't think it should be forced, especially on the kids, to expect to let her be a parent to them after everything.", "Then ask yourself why she felt she couldn't tell you the truth or why she felt like she had to go behind your back to talk about plans for Mother's Day.\n\nI'm not saying your wife is an angel. That's why I went with ESH. Going behind your back and trying to use your kid as surrogates because her relationship with her son does not held up to her expectations is shitty. But this must not be easy for her either. She lives with people who love each other, with kids who worship their dead mother and she gets nothing. Nothing from her son. Nothing from her stepkids. Nothing from her husband who is still very much in love with his late wife. \n\nThis is not working for her anymore.", "NTA \n\nRelationships where step kids see the step parent as a second parent sometimes form naturally and without pressure. You can't force something like that. For some families, it happens, and for some families, it really doesn't, but they can still have a lot of love and respect for everyone. \n\nYes, the parents can influence those relationships, especially if the kids feel that a parent or both parents really don't want that sort of bond or really encourage the kids not to form it, but it is absolutely wrong to force kids into calling the step parent mum or dad and force them to do family things when they don't want to. \n\nIf it doesn't happen naturally over time, that should be okay.\n\nNavigating being a step parent and blending families isn't easy, neither for the kids nor the parents. Your wife feels hurt, and that is just as okay as the kids' feelings, but it's wrong of her to pressure the kids. \n\nMaybe you could find a compromise and include her in going to your first wife's grave, and also include things in your plans that include her without taking away the special place your kids' mum has on that day. But only if your kids want that. If not, don't force it. \n\nAlso tho, your wife wants therapy, and I personally think that's a good idea. Therapy is almost always a good idea and maybe it can help the two of you.", "NTA\n\nFirstly it's amazing that you want to have your beloved first wife very much in the forefront of you and your children's lives.  Personally, it seems that some people move on way too fast for my liking (which I know is down to the individual but for me, I just couldn't do it). \n\nI also hate hearing step parents wanting to be referred to as the children's mum or dad when they are not. It's different if the children decide this but I would never want a step parent deciding this for them.  \n\nClaire seems pretty manipulative and you seem like an absolute great guy. Please do not let her change you or your opinion on how you want your late wife to be remembered by you or your children.", "INFO: how long has Claire been in the picture?", "In the ends it's the decision of the kids and not of Claire or what some internet strangers tell you. You all should sit down together and talk about your wishes and expectations from the family dynamic. It's understandable that Claire wishes she'd be a motherly figure to the kids, but she should've never gone behind your back and make the kids uncomfortable. You also might benefit from therapy. NTA.", "ESH. I think therapy is vital for both of you. You weren\u2019t ready to date and remarry. I understand your desire for your kids to remember and honor their mother, but you are trying to keep them fixated on reality that no longer exists and that\u2019s unhealthy. If Claire is a good person and a positive influence, having a close relationship with Claire is no disrespect to your dead wife. The more people in your children\u2019s lives who truly love them, the better.", "NTA", "NTA y\u2019all are ass backwards on this sub. One minute it\u2019s don\u2019t force kids to accept step parents in parental roles. Now it\u2019s aww poor wife, what do y\u2019all want? the kids are not disrespecting her, mistreating her or any of that. However they have a mom and she is not it. It\u2019s simple.", "NTA - honestly i'm reading these comments where people are trying to find what YOU are doing wrong that makes her reaction ok and really, you're listening to what your kids want. you're being open and upfront. their relationship seems perfectly fine for kids who are now 15 and 16. (in fact that was the time when i started pulling away from my mom in some ways because it's just that part of growing up and gaining independence.)\n\ni can understand that she might want more. but the way she's acting about it (coming to the kids instead of speaking to you about it, \"if you loved me\", and the huge thing everyone is glancing over - lying about her relationship with her son and actually the fact that her son has pulled back from her...) shows that something is not right.\n\nyou're doing well, don't let the comments by people who need her to be correct for their own personal reasons sway you from prioritizing your children and their wishes.", "Why did you marry her if she wasn't going to be a part of your life? For her sake, Claire deserves better. You should never have married her. Poor Claire.", "How long has Claire been in the children\u2019s lives? Could it be that Claire has grown to love your daughters and wants to feel needed and wanted? You are so much in love with your dead wife that you may not see the gift (Claire) that\u2019s right before you. Soft AH.", "NTA - but it might be nice for you guys to do something for Claire around Mother's Day (Step-mom day?) to show you appreciate her as I'm sure she has had a role to play in bringing up your children etc", "ESH. Claire needs to readjust her thinking to match reality and give up some of her fantasies. But if you were trying to disrespect Claire and make her feel bad, you could hardly have been harsher than what you wrote here. If your marriage is salvageable and you want to save it, talk to your therapist about a better way for *you* to make Claire feel loved and valued regardless of whether the children fulfill her wishes. I am not a therapist, but even i can think of better responses than what you described. But you get to be you.", "YTA- I think you\u2019re getting some spot in advice from the other posters.  What seems clear to me is that Claire is expressing needs and you are being controlling and refusing to listen to them.  Yes, she really should have talked to you about it and not the kids, but in her defense, they are teenagers, not little kids.  She has every right to have some sort of relationship with them that is not dictated by you.  Ok, you don\u2019t want to call that relationship \u201cmother\u201d, but she\u2019s not just some old hag that\u2019s screwing their dad either.  She\u2019s trying to care for them and you have to find a way to allow that.  It is good for them to have some sort of maternal love in their lives, whatever you call it.  You don\u2019t get to tell her what her relationship has to be, and I honestly think you need to be careful that you\u2019re not dictating that to your children too.  She doesn\u2019t need to ask for your permission to talk to them about things just like you wouldn\u2019t need to ask for her permission to talk to them either.  Why should the rules be totally different for you than for her?  That just doesn\u2019t sound fair to me at all, and I don\u2019t see how she\u2019s supposed to fit herself in the family when you\u2019re telling everyone what the terms have to be.  Your kids are old enough to mediate that themselves, however it is comfortable for them.  If they don\u2019t want to go out with her on Mother\u2019s Day, they can tell her no\u2026 but is it possible for everyone to feel loved in some other way?  What day is special for her then, honoring her role in the family?  It sounds like she gets to do all the work that a mother does but she doesn\u2019t get any of the affection and flowers.  At the very least, you guys could celebrate her as a mother to her own son by doing special.\n\nTL;dr-  She needs to be allowed to have an autonomous relationship with these kids that she cares about, and you don\u2019t get to tell everyone what the rules are for that.  She is a mother to her son, why not do something as a family to celebrate her?", "You are absolutely NTA and Claire has gone about this terribly - she can\u2019t just go behind your back and try to manipulate your children.\n\nHowever reading your comments it seems Claire is not in any sort of parental role and more like a \u2018mate\u2019. She does the fun stuff but none of the parenting or household roles, which makes me think she is very much left out of a proper relationship with your children and you to some extent. \n\nYou need to talk to her and your children, you don\u2019t have to make her their mum but surely you can see how upset your wife is and if you want to continue to be married that needs to be addressed.", "Another day. Another dead 28 year old.", "I think yta.\nDomineering...\nTrying to pre-determine what your children are allowed to feel has really f'd up their relationship with their step mom...", "NTA. You told her the conditions and she agreed.\n\nShe does Not get to change them just because She changed her mind, especially Not when Nobody else want to change. \n\nAlso good for you, for putting your children first.", "This.  My ex-husband was so determined to hurt me that my son had to call his step-mother \u2018mom\u2019.  His then wife (now 2nd ex-wife) went along with this.  My son, as a grown man now, seems to regret this.  It\u2019s about what the children want & need when they are dealing with all of life\u2019s changes.", "Relationships evolve. I wonder how much of the day to day parenting is being done by the step mom. Is she doing the work without getting acknowledged? I agree this is a situation where OP may need to give a little. It was sneaky to go through the kids though. But maybe therapy will open lines of communication between the two adults. I also wonder if OP didn't get into a relationship a little too early in his mourning process and didn't give himself space to get through this tragedy.", "I completely get what you are saying and your bring up some good points, but Claire isn\u2019t crying out for more from op but from his minor children. These kids lost their mum so young and it seems like they do have a great relationship with Claire all things considered but they just don\u2019t see her as a mother. That\u2019s completely fine, I get her feelings but they don\u2019t in any way trump the feelings of the kids in this. They have already expressed to op that they are uncomfortable with Claire pushing and don\u2019t want to change the dynamic. \n\nGenuine question, your saying that op needs to give Claire more, but what could he possibly give her in this situation that doesn\u2019t push aside his kids needs and wants? This seems more like Claire has alot of complicated feelings that she needs to sort out more then anything.", "Where I disagree with you here is that, yes, Claire is expressing needs but so are his children.  Claire went to the children first and they said to their dad that she was making them uncomfortable regarding this issue so he stepped in.  What is he supposed to do here? Force a relationship that his children do not want.  His kids have been very clear about who they view as their mum and they have expressed clearly that they do not want anyone else to come in and try and take over this role.  Neither Claire nor OP can force this relationship or bond if the kids don\u2019t want it and all it will do is isolate the kids and push them away. We don\u2019t know if Claire is celebrated at other times, such as her birthday, Christmas, etc.  This issue is specifically about Mother\u2019s Day. The children want to celebrate their own mother on this day and they are perfectly entitled to do so. They seem to have a good relationship with Claire, they just don\u2019t want to give her the title of mum, because that\u2019s not who she is to them and they want to use Mother\u2019s Day to celebrate their actual mother.  OP is NTA because he is sticking up for the needs of his kids who have expressed that they are uncomfortable with Claire trying to push something on them that they don\u2019t want that was made expressly clear to Claire from the beginning.", "The way she handled this was poorly done and it makes you NTA. But you\u2019re also being very literal and rigid in what you expect family roles to be. Families evolve, needs change, relationships change, and acting like everyone else needs to buy into your very exacting way of honoring your deceased wife\u2019s memory might no longer work for everyone. Ignoring that can be very harmful to your current family.", "Feelings can change. But the adult thing to do would be to discuss the change with her partner, not guilt trip her minor step-children. That\u2019s the part that makes her the AH.", "Yes, but it seems only Claire's feelings changed, and she tries to force them onto the rest of the family for whom nothing changed", "I have like 3-4 \"moms\" my birth mom, my best friends mom my bf mom ...... I love them all and they treat me like their own . i think keeping your kids from having a truly meaningful relationship with your new wife is pretty bad \nYou say you love her . but you dont want your kids to love her?", "it's not what he expects, it what his children want. they have made themselves, again, quite clear.", "I'm 38 now. My parents divorced when I was young and my father remarried. My \"step\" mom is a mom to me. She's been there since I was little. I call her by her name but she's still a mom who I call on mother's day. \n\nI had a friend growing up that I became really close with their family. His mom is my mom also. I call her on mother's day and other times to update her on my life. Whenever I'm in town to visit, I try to take my kids around to see her because she cares about me and then.\n\nWhen I was 25 I got married and moved to a small town where I was teaching. There was a veteran teacher who I became good colleagues with. When I had a heart issue and was about to be transported to the big city, she wanted to know I had family around, otherwise she was going to come. She's my \"show low\" mom. I call her on her birthday and mother's day.\n\nMoms come in all dimensions. Love is not a finite resource. Love is infinite and because it's not scarce, we should bestow it freely to those who deserve it. Loving another person as a mother doesn't negate the love I have for my bio mom, who has commented herself that she's happy I have my step and other moms, because she knows I'm cared for and loved.\n\nWhile Claire isn't completely wrong, she's not completely right. Maybe she can be included with you and your daughter when paying respects at the grave, so she can see the love you all have for Meggie. Maybe instead of going to the diner for mother's day, you go on Meggie's birthday and you, your daughters, and Claire's son find a new restaurant to go to. Claire might not be their bio mom, but she can be a bonus mom and can be recognized for her role, without alienating her own son, on that day.", "Except the kids don't want a bunch of moms. They've got a mom, and they've got a Claire. Claire is trying to force something the kids don't want, because of what SHE wants.", ">If all she has are the shit jobs of cooking, cleaning etc and none of the perceived benefits then she's just a housemate and a domestic helper\n\n>If you truly do all the cooking, cleaning, housework etc then you've essentially removed Claire from the day to day normality\n\n>This doesn't sound like a normal healthy household dynamic. You've separated her\n\nDamn if you do, damn if you don't huh. Do you even read what you wrote? You simply want to blame OP as the AH. Have some guts and admit it instead of pretending to be fair. Double standard hypocrite.", "You are right Claire is forcing this issue, but I also think that the kids have grown up for so long with OP saying on Meggie is mom that they wouldn't accept anything else.\n\nSo yes the kids choice should be priority number one, but it's needs to be THEIR actual choice.", "I truly don't think you love Claire. I think you were looking for a bed mate. That seems to be her only purpose.", "But Claire is the one who lied from the beginning; she said she was happy to not have to be in the mother role with his children then did a 180 & is now fighting for a place she has no right to fight for. If she hadn't lied, OP wouldn't have married the chick & this wouldn't be an issue."]}
