Like grandparents, sisters, aunt. The man who seemed to be the grandfather was taking care of a baby who I presumed doesn't have barely 6 months. Then the baby started to cry and her mother suddenly appeared and stated that she needed a diaper change. She asked for the aunt of the baby to fetch a bag with baby stuff and proceeded to simply lay the child down in one of the couches where a guy who didn't seem like part of the family was sat. He even said something in surprise, since the woman didn't say anything and just laid the baby there and started to take the diaper off. \n\nGiven the situation and the awkwardness, and since they were new to the clinic, I pointed out that there was a bathroom right at the end of the room in case the mother wanted more privacy and tranquility to change her baby, especially because the little girl didn't stop crying and the random dude had to sort of hold her so she didn't roll out of the couch. When I said that, the woman shot me a very pissed off, angry look and said very curtly that \"I should know better that there wasn't any diapers changer there\". I fell quiet and every family member of hers looked at me like I've said the most offensive thing ever.

AITA?\n\nEDIT 1: I don't know if it's relevant, but the family's car was parked just in front of the clinic, and it was a huge SUV. The aunt went to the car to fetch the baby's bag and I could see it from the window. The baby even was in her baby comfort/bebe confort. Her stuff bag was so full I thought it had a changing mat in it because it'd sure fit one. I also thought the mother could change the baby in the baby comfort, so even if she didn't have the mat, she could maybe bring the baby to the WC and change her in the comfort. I didn't know that according to the baby's age, you have to lie them down to change them.\n\nEDIT 2: The WC's counter has a huge surface area. It is both wide and long, so I believe it could easily fit the baby since she wasn't big. The counter is never wet too, even around the sink. And they always keep tons of toilette paper there.", "created_utc": 1683580037, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13c4ukx/aita_for_pointing_out_where_the_bathroom_was_to_a/", "score": 1017, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
