My husband and I are married for more than 5 years and have 3 kids..I come from a different state and where I live every state has it's own language..I had to go no contact with my family before my wedding because my parents didn't approve of relationship and were toxic AF..I accepted my husband's culture anud learnt his language after marriage..I did everything happily. I rarely speak my own language as there is nobody around who actually speaks my language.But, whenever I go to restaurants I often find waiters speaking in my language. It just makes me feel good when I exchange few words with them in my first language. On multiple occasions my husbagnd expressed his disgust towards my language because it doesn't sound sophisticated. \n\nOver this weekend when I was about to leave the restaurant I told our waiter what an amazing experience we had and thanked him in my own language. Two days later my husband told me to not speak in my first language as getting friendly with the waiters makes me look cheap. Upon asking him to explain himself he says that it's ok when it's just him but, not when we are surrounded by friends.It makes me look CHEAP..\n\nHere is where I might be the AH..he tried to justify calling me cheap. And I brought up an incident that happened 4 years ago. I told him he has no right to call me cheap when he is the one who got fired for sending soft porn(an audio) to a girl he barely knew . He got quiet and said it was uncalled for ..\n\nEDIT:Thanks for understanding my deep feelings towards my language. To clear it for everyone..what my husband meant was I was not being classy ..Yes,he is rich and I come from a state which is considered to be poor..but he is also very kind towards people irrespective of their financial background. So, what I feel is he got a problem with my language more than anything else.Divorce is not something I would consider over this but, I do understand your emotions about asking me to give it a thought..He does have arrogance around his wealth and I would often see him bragging about his money but, his friends are worse..I just stay silent during those talks. I guess I have been a poor person since birth and not yet used to being with a rich husband ..He is not a cheater.He sent a moaning audio to a coworker.   it is a funny prank if the other party is cool about it .but, this particular girl felt uncomfortable and complained about this to the HR .My husband doesn't understand boundaries with people..I  tried to talk sense into him and he has definitely worked on this .My in-laws are amazing people..but,my parents were toxic AF..all you people telling that I should have listened to my parents..My parents never met him. They just wanted me to be in their control for ever. They were abusive..I literally had to run away with my younger sister because of domestic violence.People calling me AH, thank you.I know I am petty and can be extremely hurtful with my words if triggered .I should not have brought that up especially when he tried and became better in that area.. I speak 5 languages..My husband thinks I sound funny and awful while speaking English because I have an accent compared to the local people. well, i learnt English from foreign TV channels since, people in my state didn't speak much of English.so, I am proud of myself and people often complement me for my English..He also got a problem with my second language because I sound more like people from a different group than my own while speaking.Then comes my first language and you all know how he feels about it. His constant nagging towards every language I speak is what triggered me ..

I live in a country with dialects as well and yes, people joke about each others dialects all the time. But insulting your own wife? He should be ashamed! So apparently he holds the prejudice, that people that speak your language/ are from your state, are cheap or poor or illiterate or uncultured, etc. Considering that language is a cultural property, that is racist. Or if anything, classist. And then he harassed some girl with porn?
