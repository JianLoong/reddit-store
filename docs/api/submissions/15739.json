My husband and I are married for more than 5 years and have 3 kids..I come from a different state and where I live every state has it's own language..I had to go no contact with my family before my wedding because my parents didn't approve of relationship and were toxic AF..I accepted my husband's culture anud learnt his language after marriage..I did everything happily. I rarely speak my own language as there is nobody around who actually speaks my language.But, whenever I go to restaurants I often find waiters speaking in my language. It just makes me feel good when I exchange few words with them in my first language. On multiple occasions my husband expressed his disgust towards my language because it doesn't sound sophisticated. \n\nOver this weekend when I was about to leave the restaurant I told our waiter what an amazing experience we had and thanked him in my own language. Two days later my husband told me to not speak in my first language as getting friendly with the waiters makes me look cheap. Upon asking him to explain himself he says that it's ok when it's just him but, not when we are surrounded by friends.It makes me look CHEAP..\n\nHere is where I might be the AH..he tried to justify calling me cheap.

Please reconsider this marriage.\n\nNTA", "I mean, I guess your remark was maybe uncalled for, but I can't get too worked up about it. NTA.\n\nPrefacing my response by saying my answer is based on American culture, but your husband sounds like an elitist asshole. Does he view you as less than because you're from, in his view, a less cultured state? Is the \"help\" somehow not worthy of respect and politeness? \n\nCombined with the porn thing, I'm wondering why you're with this jerk.", "NTA. I bet it feels wonderful to speak your native tongue to a stranger. Keep doing it. Your husband is the AH.", "NTA Waiters are people too. You husband is too rich to speak to them? That's just gross. And on top of that it sounds like he's calling your language cheap, which is just racist. It makes me wonder if it is just the language he doesn't like or the state and culture behind it. He really needs to reflect on why he looks down on everyone.", "Ohhhh so much NTA...\n\nA language doesn't make you look cheap unless you associate certain things with a person speaking it. I live in a country with dialects as well and yes, people joke about each others dialects all the time. But insulting your own wife? He should be ashamed! So apparently he holds the prejudice, that people that speak your language/ are from your state, are cheap or poor or illiterate or uncultured, etc. Considering that language is a cultural property, that is racist. Or if anything, classist. And then he harassed some girl with porn? Oh great: sexist, too!\n\nI bet you're putting up with a lot more from this man on the regular and now he's surprised you're standing up for once for something important to you. NTA and Shame on him.\n\nedit: How about you ask him if he thinks that you're a cheap, iliterate little idiot? Cause that's what he's saying, when in reality you gave up everything for this man and learned his language. Shame on him for trying to force you to give up even that connection to your heritage.", "NTA.   Since when is a language \u201ccheap?\u201d  Your husband is a major AH", "NTA . he's emotionally abusing you and clearly can't take criticism", "Congratulations husband. You are the AH.", "NTA\n\nSounds like maybe you should have listened to your parents......", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being very judgemental and discriminatory, and seems to have some ugly views about people who speak your native language. Sounds like a major red flag to me.", "NTA for reacting to your husband's mean-spirited  comments.  He sounds exhausting. \n\n(you bringing up the past is not a great way to proceed, but calling you \"cheap\" has nothing to do with speaking your homeland's language either)", "When you hate to admit your parents were right but not for the reasons they said.", "> I told him he has no right to call me cheap when he is the one who got   \nfired for sending soft porn(an audio) to a girl he barely knew\n\nwtf", "NTA.  That didn't go where it looked like it would and was worse than expected.", "NTA he sounds like a dick", "NTA. His vulgar actions speak for themselves. They are cheap. Talking in a second language unless done for malice purposes is quite innocuous.", "NTA. You need to step back and take a long look at your relationship. He\u2019s clearly a bigot. He demeans you. And he sexually harassed a coworker. He\u2019s not going to change. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with this?", "NTA\n\nYou did nothing even remotely questionable. It is anything but \"cheap\" to be able to speak comfortably with people from all walks of life and there's not much more vulgar than the belief that waitstaff are beneath notice,  which appears to be your husband's view.\n\nEven sending inappropriate to women at work is not as vulgar,  though it does come close. It's not ideal to throw unrelated wrongs into an argument but since he's seen fit to berate you repeatedly for being bilingual, I can't really blame you for reminding him of what \"cheap\" behavior really is.", "ESH although your husband sucks waaaaaaaay more. There is no way speaking another language makes you look cheap. That is just outright prejudice if not racist. \n\nHowever there is NO reason to drag his past behavior into this discussion. What does that have to do with it? \n\nHis behavior sounds horrendous though\u2014why are you with him??", "NTA but bringing up what he did 4 years ago is am asshole move", "ESH. You guys are horrible for each other. He\u2019s clearly got a questionable character at best but you clearly don\u2019t have a problem staying with someone who not only cheated on you but did so by sending inappropriate messages or images to an non-consenting party.", "ESH.\n\nI would have gone with N-T-A if you hadn't brought up a bad example of something that makes him \"cheap\", which is petty on your side.\n\nYou talking to a restaurant worker in your native language doesn't make you cheap, him getting fired for that reason also doesn't make him cheap. Frankly, not even sure what definition of \"cheap\" you're both using here.", "Bringing up old fights and re-fighting them is a huge nono. Him downing on your heritage sucks too.

Due to this, many were killed, including many only children leading to families dying out\n\nThe author Rudyard Kipling famously had his only son receive a commission despite his poor eyesight, causing him to be rejected by the British army", "That makes sense. I was guessing Indian here where men often want their wives to speak their language and there's still so much value placed on birthplace and language.

Hindu is a religion, Hindi is the language.\n\nYes, the way OP\u2019s husband is acting is very classist and racist as well, as each language group is its own ethnicity.

I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s exclusive to high caste Indians as I can see rude behavior from entitled people in the US (ex. my FIL, who is embarrassing to eat with at restaurants bc he\u2019s rude to waiters), but it gets my goat to see Indians do it when there\u2019s really no scriptural basis for the discrimination.
