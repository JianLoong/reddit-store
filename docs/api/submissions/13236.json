We are not together and I acknowledge the age gap is big. We were two consenting adults when we met.\n\nDue to an addiction I had, my parents disowned me and stopped paying for my education when I was 18. When I got knocked up by Richard, he helped me pay for my degree. We split amicably when our son was two but he continued to help me with my rent and college. We remained close friends and he is amazing father to our son. \n\nLast week, it was my son's birthday. I will admit that we do like to spoil the little rascal so during last weekend, we had a small birthday dinner at my place with just family on the Saturday and a party at Richard's house the next day. \n\nMost of my family likes Richard. I was NC with my family during the early stages of our relationship so when they met him they were put off by the age gap but they got to know him and realized that he's a good man. The only person that hasn't warmed up to him is my older brother, Aaron (30M). Aaron was never the protective older brother type and I know he feels bad about it as I fell into trouble as a teen and got disowned and he feels that if he tried harder, he could've prevented that. He's trying to be protective now by being standoffish about Richard and also by barely talking to him.\n\n\nSo, during the dinner at my place, Richard arrived late from work as he works in a field that's very demanding. He has had to miss previous birthday parties because of this and it upset our son a lot. Aaron made a comment about this and I took him aside and said 'not at my son's birthday dinner'. He agreed to behave.\n\nHowever, he kept doing snide little things like calling Richard 'geriatric' when he mentioned his back hurt, pointing out his gray hairs etc. Basically, trying to make him look old. The final straw was when my son's older sister dropped by with her own son (6M) and my brother said to Richard that it was weird that his son and grandson were almost the same age. At this, I took my brother aside again and told him to leave. He called me an AH for expecting him to be nice to someone he doesn't like for 'valid reasons' (age gap) and I told him I didn't care because my son's birthday dinner is not the place to air out grievances. He's expecting an apology.

Why does your brother feel the need to turn your kid's bday party into a hatefest for the kid's parent? Not appropriate at all.", "NTA - This post isn\u2019t meant for us to judge OP about the age gap, especially since Richard seems like he\u2019s been doing everything right. Also, balancing a child and an intense career (which does secure the child\u2019s future) is a no-win at times. Unfortunately, it means missing events sometimes, but he made it to this one even though he was late. It happens.\n\nBut regardless, as you said that was neither the time or place. Aaron is 30, he can suck it up long enough to be civil to the father of his nephew, especially after you already said something. Aaron is being childish by thinking YOU should apologize for telling him he can\u2019t make a scene over two consenting adults at a child\u2019s birthday party.

If he was genuinely 'doing it for you' then he wouldn't call you an AH after being rude to your co-parent. It's entirely the opposite of helpful as well.

Also, it could start to make Richard react badly and ruin the good co parenting and good relationship you have.

MAD respect for those 2, God Bless all of you. As for the 3rd wheel. He needs to either be supportive, shut up, or move on. NOTHING on this planet should come between your child's wellbeing and his/her parents. If the parents were abusive, neglectful, etc, I would cite a reason to step in. But in a more mature way.

Drug addict teenage sister and then essentially was her sugar daddy while she tried to get her crap together. I don't know if it was because your family cut you off or you had addiction or psychological problems but I'm having a hard time understanding how you cannot see this as creepy as hell?
