We are not together and I acknowledge the age gap is big. We were two consenting adults when we met.\n\nDue to an addiction I had, my parents disowned me and stopped paying for my education when I was 18. When I got knocked up by Richard, he helped me pay for my degree. We split amicably when our son was two but he continued to help me with my rent and college. We remained close friends and he is amazing father to our son. \n\nLast week, it was my son's birthday. I will admit that we do like to spoil the little rascal so during last weekend, we had a small birthday dinner at my place with just family on the Saturday and a party at Richard's house the next day. \n\nMost of my family likes Richard. I was NC with my family during the early stages of our relationship so when they met him they were put off by the age gap but they got to know him and realized that he's a good man. The only person that hasn't warmed up to him is my older brother, Aaron (30M). Aaron was never the protective older brother type and I know he feels bad about it as I fell into trouble as a teen and got disowned and he feels that if he tried harder, he could've prevented that. He's trying to be protective now by being standoffish about Richard and also by barely talking to him.\n\n\nSo, during the dinner at my place, Richard arrived late from work as he works in a field that's very demanding. He has had to miss previous birthday parties because of this and it upset our son a lot. Aaron made a comment about this and I took him aside and said 'not at my son's birthday dinner'. He agreed to behave.\n\nHowever, he kept doing snide little things like calling Richard 'geriatric' when he mentioned his back hurt, pointing out his gray hairs etc. Basically, trying to make him look old. The final straw was when my son's older sister dropped by with her own son (6M) and my brother said to Richard that it was weird that his son and grandson were almost the same age. At this, I took my brother aside again and told him to leave. He called me an AH for expecting him to be nice to someone he doesn't like for 'valid reasons' (age gap) and I told him I didn't care because my son's birthday dinner is not the place to air out grievances. He's expecting an apology.

Brother is a royal AH. Kids party is not the place to bad mouth anyone. NO apology needed.", "NTA. You're not even with this guy anymore. Why does your brother feel the need to turn your kid's bday party into a hatefest for the kid's parent? Not appropriate at all.", "NTA - This post isn\u2019t meant for us to judge OP about the age gap, especially since Richard seems like he\u2019s been doing everything right. Also, balancing a child and an intense career (which does secure the child\u2019s future) is a no-win at times. Unfortunately, it means missing events sometimes, but he made it to this one even though he was late. It happens.\n\nBut regardless, as you said that was neither the time or place. Aaron is 30, he can suck it up long enough to be civil to the father of his nephew, especially after you already said something. Aaron is being childish by thinking YOU should apologize for telling him he can\u2019t make a scene over two consenting adults at a child\u2019s birthday party. If he thinks he shouldn\u2019t be expected to act civil towards Richard, then he\u2019s welcome to not show up.", "I mean, he doesn't like him because it sounds like he picked a vulnerable girl dealing with addiction issues that was less than half his age, then made her financially dependant on him.", "NTA, not the time or place for bs, and whatever your brother feels, he should want kiddo to be surrounded by people who love him and want what's best, not petty personal drama that leads to division.", "NTA, your brother shouldn't make remarks near the kids. But baby daddy is a massive creep and definitely took advantage of you whether you want to remain in denial about it or not. I wouldn't be caught dead being amicable with that predator, so I simply wouldn't go.", "NTA. You were right to keep the focus on your sons birthday party. Your brother was out of line. He sounds exhausting to deal with.", "NTA.\n\nYour brother can not like him all he wants because the huge age gap, but that doesn't give him the go ahead to be an AH in any setting. Much less your sons birthday party. Very selfish. Again, NTA. Brother is the AH.", "NTA. Age gap aside, its a kids birthday party. Not a situation to have a adult conversation about your kids dad or his age.", "NTA\n\nIt's not unreasonable to ask your brother to not be an asshole at ANY event, birthday dinner or otherwise.\n\nAarons was being a total asshole how he spoke of your baby's Dad.\n\nHe can wait forever for an apology, he doesn't deserve one. But he does OWE you and Richard one for how he shoots his asshole mouth off.\n\nAnd as to the 'protector brother' motivation. Well that's entirely self centred. If he was genuinely 'doing it for you' then he wouldn't call you an AH after being rude to your co-parent. It's entirely the opposite of helpful as well. Pissing off and alienating a co-parents who has largely from your account been decent, that's not productive.\n\nNope it is Aaron who is 100% completely and totally an AH.", "NTA\n\nYour brother was incredibly rude and insulting", "NTA You have a guest bad mouthing and being verbally abusive and that always should result in expulsion. You do not owe them an apology, in fact I would be going low contact. Children pick up other people bad mouthing their parent and it can make them anxious and insecure. Also, it could start to make Richard react badly and ruin the good co parenting and good relationship you have. Your son is only 8, that is 10 years ahead of coparenting and you do not want anything blowing that out of the water. You need to push your brother out of the equation.", "The true real heroes in this story are the mom and biological father. 2 amazing people who in spite of not being able to keep their marriage intact, are able to be good and respectful to each other and raise that child in a loving, caring 2 parent home. MAD respect for those 2, God Bless all of you. As for the 3rd wheel. He needs to either be supportive, shut up, or move on. NOTHING on this planet should come between your child's wellbeing and his/her parents. If the parents were abusive, neglectful, etc, I would cite a reason to step in. But in a more mature way. But this is far from the case.  So although it breaks my heart to see you guys divorced, it warms my heart to see how well you are rasing your child, together but apart.", "NTA. Regardless of anyone's opinion on the age gap you warned him to behave and he did not. In front of kids.", "NTA.", "NTA. Buuuut can you blame him? A gross 40 year old man knocked up his homeless(?) Drug addict teenage sister and then essentially was her sugar daddy while she tried to get her crap together. I don't know if it was because your family cut you off or you had addiction or psychological problems but I'm having a hard time understanding how you cannot see this as creepy as hell? This is legitimately disturbing. Good on you though for finding a grandfather to take care of you and his child that he impregnated into a teenager. Jesus Christ. I don't blame your brother for being rude to him.", "NTA - Your brother sounds immature.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
