We are not together and I acknowledge the age gap is big. We were two consenting adults when we met.\n\nDue to an addiction I had, my parents disowned me and stopped paying for my education when I was 18. When I got knocked up by Richard, he helped me pay for my degree. We split amicably when our son was two but he continued to help me with my rent and college. We remained close friends and he is amazing father to our son. \n\nLast week, it was my son's birthday. I will admit that we do like to spoil the little rascal so during last weekend, we had a small birthday dinner at my place with just family on the Saturday and a party at Richard's house the next day. \n\nMost of my family likes Richard. I was NC with my family during the early stages of our relationship so when they met him they were put off by the age gap but they got to know him and realized that he's a good man. The only person that hasn't warmed up to him is my older brother, Aaron (30M). Aaron was never the protective older brother type and I know he feels bad about it as I fell into trouble as a teen and got disowned and he feels that if he tried harder, he could've prevented that. He's trying to be protective now by being standoffish about Richard and also by barely talking to him.\n\n\nSo, during the dinner at my place, Richard arrived late from work as he works in a field that's very demanding. He has had to miss previous birthday parties because of this and it upset our son a lot. Aaron made a comment about this and I took him aside and said 'not at my son's birthday dinner'. He agreed to behave.\n\nHowever, he kept doing snide little things like calling Richard 'geriatric' when he mentioned his back hurt, pointing out his gray hairs etc. Basically, trying to make him look old. The final straw was when my son's older sister dropped by with her own son (6M) and my brother said to Richard that it was weird that his son and grandson were almost the same age. At this, I took my brother aside again and told him to leave. He called me an AH for expecting him to be nice to someone he doesn't like for 'valid reasons' (age gap) and I told him I didn't care because my son's birthday dinner is not the place to air out grievances.

But pretending that the age difference doesn\u2019t matter, that the circumstances don\u2019t matter, is not really looking at the whole issue.", "Assume much?", "This should be top comment", "if he cared that much then he would have helped his sister instead of letting her be homeless", "I know right! If some 40 yr old dude knocked my 18 yr old sister up, I\u2019d be pissed too. I wouldn\u2019t care how nice he was, he would still be a creep to me no matter what.", "OP asked him to not do this at her kid's birthday party and he couldn't shut the f up for one night for his sister's nor her kid's sake, brother is absolutely TA.

I could maybe see the comments if they were married or something but bro needs to chill", "You mean, less than the age gap between the president of France and his wife? They seem to be managing.", "OP already said they aren\u2019t still together but it is amicable. might want to read it again. \nnot to mention that big age differences absolutely can end well. or not. no different than other relationships.", "They\u2019re rekindling apparently.\n\nBut I\u2019d say the age gap isn\u2019t just creepy, it\u2019s predatory.", "Seems like you haven't grown mentally jn the last 9 years if you still don't understand what a predator he is.", "There is an insane anti age gap bias prevalent in this sub. People start screaming even if it's just 10 years age difference, and will not understand that an age gap is okay if both parties are consulting adults, and that it doesn't always have to be a creepy situation.", "Wait, so you\u2019re getting back together with the man who impregnated you when you were 19 and he was in his 40s?\n\nNo wonder you\u2019re brother is upset.\n\nResponse since OP has blocked me:\n\nSounds like you\u2019re pretty sure. Do you think he has no inkling that it could never happen? \n\nJust because you haven\u2019t told him doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not worried about the possibility.\n\nAs an older sister, I would do everything in my power to keep a predator like that away from my younger sib.\n\n\nYTA for this and not accepting your judgement.", "I mean, without him you probably wouldn't have been a pregnant teenager lol", "Carried on with your recovery, but not pregnant?", "She was his teacher who groomed him, is that really the example you want to go with?", "They're determined to make me a victim while simultaneously being shitty towards me?

Like what words are you omitting as you read what you type", "If he wasn't seeking anyone out, why did he sleep with you? \n\nLook, no one's blaming *you* for his actions, and it is absolutely not a slight against you, your character and values, etc, that you slept with him. This is solely an issue against him. A 40 year old has no reason to sleep with a 19 year old-the power imbalance between the two of you was unacceptable for him to take advantage of that. \n\nIt's also okay to acknowledge that what he did was wrong while also accepting that he's a responsible father. Both can be true at the same time: you can call him out for sleeping with a 19 year old who was recovering from an addiction after being kicked out by her parents (not sure what your support system was like after that, bc that will also contribute) *and* praise him for being a good father. Ppl are complex, and doing one bad thing doesn't mean they aren't capable of doing a good thing.", "You were an addict. In a bar.

Ik grown ppl with jobs that need help a month on rent that doesn\u2019t mean they financially dependable.  And him helping her get college was for definitely not for his benefit. She never mentioned he pays for clothes, food or even her rent on a constant basis. If she pays for herself and kid how is she dependent on him. And him paying for her apt, what can she do be homeless considering her parents disowned her and they been split up for 6 years. Sounds to me he\u2019s better than a lot of the dads we hear about on this sub.", "well said. these were my thoughts too.", "alcohol was not the drug I was abusing, recovering addicts are allowed to enjoy their lives smh", "That\u2019s not what this post is about", "it's just not relevant at this point. they aren't together, they had an amicable split, he has been consistently financially helpful to her. OP doesn't owe you or anyone here a full rundown of his credentials. they have a child they are coparenting and it's weird and unhelpful of a guest at that child's party is constantly making snide remarks about the child's parent. like it's just selfishly hostile in a way that just creates problems for the child and for OP. \n\nit's fine to raise eyebrows at the age gap i definitely did but at this point the situation is done and by the only account we have it was a healthier situation than her previous life stage, and has left her in a good enough place at this life stage to be happily moved on, in regular contact with the ex, and able to raise the child well enough to 'spoil' him on birthdays. when i went through my own experience of a bad age gap relationship by the time i reached 27 i definitely had realised enough to not be on good terms with the ex at all, all we can do is trust OP's word on her experience instead of being aggy and derailing to something that's just moot.", "Unless he FORCED HER, op was willing participant in her sons conception. Y\u2019all gotta stop with the infantilizing people", "HARD Agree! Why does it matter what happened in OPs past? The question at hand is regarding something totally different....her AH brothers childish behavior.", "Manipulation / taking advantage is also a type of force. Just not physical. Stop excusing predatory behaviour and preying on teens by older people.   \n\n\nGrooming is also not force.. it is still fucking bad and abuse.", "Who says those things were in play. Who says he groomed her. Why do y\u2019all assume that every age gap relationship is nefarious. I\u2019m not defending predatory behavior, because according to Op there was none. Stop infantilizing and victimizing people who DONT WANT TO BE VICTIMS. Until she says differently, that\u2019s the narrative I\u2019m going with. \n\nHow y\u2019all think y\u2019all have the right to tell this girl what her relationship with her BD was is just wild as hell to me. Unless you were a fly on the wall through out the whole relationship, you can\u2019t say what their relationship was\n\nThere are women who prefer older men, and that\u2019s their business.
