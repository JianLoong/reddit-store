It is about providing a safe, healthy, and stable life for you period. \n\nAnd of course you can tell her off but she seems a bit toxic already and I don't know where that is going to get you. Call your dad, your local Child Protective Services (If he's paying child support there is most likely a case file), or if you feel like things have gone too far call the nonemergency police line, and if things have gone way too far call 911 but explain your situation to the dispatcher. (I'm not really advising the 911 call but it's your life and if you love your dad and are being kept away from him that is arguably criminal)\n\nI'd say your mom is the AH not you, in the state I grew up in you can be back on CS but that doesn't deny custody or visitation rights.", "NTA. Your mom is literally holding you for ransom.  Isn\u2019t that illegal?", "NTA you have the right to see your father but I would be careful because she might try to punish you for this", "It sounds as though your mother is using the money for herself and not using it to help you, in at your age should be put in the savings for college. I'm not sure where you live, but if you live in the United States, chances are you are old enough to have a say. Why don't you live with your father? What would happen if you did?", "You WNBTA for talking to her about this, but I do not suggest that you tell her off.  That will only make her angry, and will not get you the result you are looking for.  You have every right to be upset, and you would not be TA for going off on her, it just would not help.  I do suggest you try to have a calm conversation with her and explain that not being able to see your father is hurting you, and not just hurting him.  It is unfair to punish you for your father's problems.  If telling her all of this does not help, is there any other adult you trust that you can talk to?", "Alright, I\u2019ma be blunt about this. Your Mom sounds evil, and I think, if you want to and he is able to, it\u2019s about time you request to live with him. It seems from what little I\u2019ve read, that you want to have as great of a relationship as you can with him. Bonus points, you are 16, and unless the law states you can\u2019t see him because your Mom says so, she can\u2019t force you to not see him. Unless there is a court order, you can see him as much as you wish to. So, my advice, Scream and Shout, and let it All out!", "Your right to see your father is unrelated to his ability to pay child support. Yourm other is very unfair to weaponise access to you over this. And he is trying to resolve it. Can you frame this as being about your rights? \"I understand that you are carrying the financial responsibility for me at the moment and dad is working to sort this out. But I have a right to a relationship with my father independent of the money he needs to give you.\" Good luck - it is very unfair that you are being used in this way. NTA.", "NTA. Sorry OP but your mother is a selfish, greedy and petty little woman. Nothing worse than a parent who uses their child as a weapon to punish the other parent.

And if he isn't allowed to see you then he doesn't have to pay child support legally", "OP, you are not an idiot, or any other rude label. \n\nPlease tell your mother that She is hurting you. That withholding visitation hurts You. That not only is your relationship with your dad suffering, but your relationship with her is on shaky ground. \n\nThe money is an issue. His being without a job was an issue.

You are her kid, so I just can't see telling her off or blowing up at her ending well. \n\nHowever you definitely should express how your feeling to her! You could say you understand why she is upset, but that you don't feel it is fair to you to keep you from your dad bc of it. That it is important to you to spend time with him and you don't feel it's right that you can't see him bc of an issue between them (your parents). Regardless of money or whatever issue it could be. Try to just be honest about how upsetting it is to you and how it is affecting you, rather than coming from an angle of just being mad at your mom. I know that is not easy, but I think it could end up working more in your favor, and I would hope that your mom would appreciate your honesty and maturity in talking with her about it rather than just blowing up. \n\n\nAs a fellow child of divorced parents, I am truly sorry that you are in this position at all. It isn't right and I feel for you."]}
