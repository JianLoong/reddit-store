You expect your sister to just not give a shit that you are asserting her husband is untrustworthy and possibly a child predator. You're just like people that have a childfree wedding and then are mad people don't come. You set your boundaries and your sister gets to choose how she responds to them.

Adults are also judgemental (you already proving this by saying he gives off creep vibes) so he might find it harder to socialise and get nervous around adults.", "Hey I'm not saying its right, I'm just saying everyone responding to OP like she's totally unreasonable isn't examining their own biases well enough.", "Ya, I'm very confused by a lot of these comments. I have an ND cousin in his 30s who spends most of his time playing Switch or talking Pok\u00e9mon with my kids when he comes over and it never once occurred to me to be concerned about that.", "If I saw a man like that playing with kids I would care. Because it would look like a responsible adult is making sure kids are entertained and behaved while also having the balls go against the misandrist views of society. I'd think it's dope.", "There is no good way to explain this in a way that will not likely end your relationship with your sister.", "\u201cWe don\u2019t want adult men alone with our daughter. I hope you can understand and work with us on that.\u201d", ">she refuses to pick up and meet me half way\n\nThere is no \"half way\" here.", "How is she being unreasonable?  You pretty much called her husband a pervert with no proof other than your gut.  Maybe without using those words, but the implication is clear.  I wouldn't blame her if she never wanted to speak to you or your child again.  YTA", "Even if she \"agrees\" do you really think she'll actually 100% stick to it? It's her husband obviously she's not going to think he's going to do anything bad and will probably have him around her without your knowledge.", "You are asking your sister to look her husband in the eyes and say \"Sorry honey, I'm going to go see my family but you can't come because my sister thinks you will molest her daughter. Have fun, I'll be back in a few hours.\"  \n\nIt's crazy that you think you will be able to maintain a relationship with your sister going forward. You have rejected her most basic life choice and accused her partner of the most vile crimes without a single piece of evidence.", "It\u2019s not that she \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d do something without her husband, it\u2019s that you think she\u2019s married to someone who isn\u2019t safe to be around your daughter. Is the husband ever truly alone with your daughter? Why do you fear him being around her? \n\nYou cannot expect your sister to just exist in your bubble like normal with you thinking her husband is a predator. Your daughter isn\u2019t \u201csuffering\u201d either, it\u2019s just an adjustment. I have NO idea how I would react if my sister said something like this to me. I have had to not be around my sister in law due to her partner being a legit predator, but we had concrete reasons to not be around him, and she knew it and didn\u2019t fuss when we wanted nothing to do with them over it. She now is thankfully separated and he\u2019s been arrested for his crimes.", "It's not called \"proactive\" when your actions are based on nothing tangible; it's called \"paranoid.\" You don't have to compromise anything - in the end it's your kid and your decision. But your sister also doesn't have to have a relationship with someone who insinuated her husband was an abuser for no reason.", "So your sister has to distance herself from HER HUSBAND because you want her in your life but not her husband? Because of your gut? How long have you even known him? Have you looked up police records? Look, I\u2019m queen of trusting your gut but you can\u2019t have your cake and eat it too. It\u2019s incredibly insulting to tell your sister you think her husband might molest your daughter when there\u2019s nothing concrete to back it up. Of course she doesn\u2019t want to be around you. You pushed her away. Not just from yourself but from your daughter too. If you\u2019re going to die on this hill, you already know it comes with sacrifices. This is unreal", "Is he on the spectrum or not OP. How welcoming have you been to this guy? \n\nHonestly right now you sound like you literally have no reason and are just trying to make things up. Are you all jealous that your sister has a husband that is actually kind and makes time for the kids unlike your own husbands?", "Do you actually let her go outside? With that thought process she won't be allowed to go to school, friends, grandmas.", "You are not entitled to your sisters time dude. You have an issue, so you deal with the consequences.", ">So I have to compromise my feelings as a parent because my sister cannot do something without her husband?\n\nNo, but you don't get to have it work out the way you want. You have every right to listen to your gut feeling and your sister has every right to be offended by it.", "> If my sister takes her out he most likely will come along. \n\nSo that's not your sister's husband being alone with the kid then. \n\nHe's around cause married people like to spend time together. And this is his niece. God forbid someone cares about their niece. \n\nWhere's your SO is all of this? Or is he not around?", "Of course they are! My hubby & I are always together when we go to families or friends houses. Do you trust your sister? Do you honestly think your sister would allow anything to happen to her? If you do think your sister would be complicit with this Uncle abusing her niece then you\u2019ve got bigger problems than you think!", "So you've known him for 14 years and have no examples of bad behavior?", "That is not disgusting, it is reality. Loser!", "Kind of like OP.", "You hit the nail right on the head!", "I asked the same question no answer from the OP.", "My thoughts too.", "It is only paranoia until something happens.", "I do not not know, my sister nor has he ever said anything.", "My SO is not a huge fan of him either. My sister has left her alone with him when she had to go in for a work emergency. She has let him change her a couple of times.", "My bet is that he is or he can just tell none of the adults are interested in being around him because they are judgy.", "So what has happened that triggered this?", "Well, then, lock your kid in the house, homeschool her, don't let her have any friends and sleep well knowing that you have been super proactive in ensuring her safety.", "Plenty of people have been paranoid about others in the past and believed they were out to get them when they've been wrong. Sorry to burst your bubble but most assaults on children are done by people that the parents trust.", "yes this is exactly what people with agoraphobia and other irrational fears/phobias say. you need a therapist", "Why? \n\nWhat has happened that makes you assume THIS man is going to hurt your kid? \n\nAlso if your daughter had something happen to her I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be crying to go to her aunts. Clearly she is comfortable around BOTH of them.", "Wait till she has the feeling about her husband. He will never see his daughter again.", "Based off everything she has said I will take that bet. God I feel for that guy.", "See this is the problem, she really is not comfortable around him when I am around. She barely interacts with him when I am around even goes as far to avoid and ignore him, but according to my sister and the videos I have seen she is extremely comfortable around him when I am not around giving him hugs, he bought her a light saber and they have a video of them running after my sister, or they slowly creep up on my sister and shout rawr. \n\nYet we can never duplicated this when I am around. She avoids him like the plague. \n\nThis behavior is weird.", "Because you've made it clear to your child that he isn't a good person. Kids pick up on parent behavior. She's able to have fun with him without having to worry about hurting crazy mommy's feelings. You have taught her to not like him.", "Your behavior is weird. \n\nMaybe she\u2019s not around him because you don\u2019t let her around him when you\u2019re around.\n\nEnjoy paying for childcare now.", "Is it possible your daughter is picking up on your dislike of BIL and mirroring your behaviour towards him when you are around?", "As someone else already has said. \nShe picks it up from you, most likely.  \nYou decided he's a danger. She's 2, not stupid. She can sense your paranoia and fear miles away. \nKids pick up on these things so easily. That's why kids change behaviour, too. for example, mom and dad had a fight. And now acts cold to each other. The kid will react one way or another. Are you sad? Kid will try either being silly or hug you to comfort. \nYou circle around with fear. Yeah. Bingo. They will avoid the person to not upset you. \n\n(I have kids, yes. 3 of them)", "That may be possible, even my SO is cold around him. He had a talk with him after we found out my sister told us he changed her. He was livid, but my SO could not get a read on the guy."]}
