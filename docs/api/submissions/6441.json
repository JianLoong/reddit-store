Two bedrooms + en-suite for us to use, one bedroom each + shared bathroom for the two flatmates.\n\nOne flatmate \u201cAlex\u201d pretty much keeps to herself, the other one \u201cKaitlin\u201d (32F) is quite strongly opinionated and much more social. Kaitlin is also child-free and occasionally very vocal about it (as in, it\u2019s not constant, but when something child related comes up she will interject without fail).\n\nAnyway, wife and I were finally successful in conceiving and decided to tell both of our flatmates three months into the pregnancy. We chose three months as we didn\u2019t want to announce it to anyone too early in case of a miscarriage, but also wanted to give flatmates plenty of time to find somewhere else if they (understandably) didn\u2019t want to live with a newborn. In the end, both said they wanted to stay flatting with us as the location is good and the house is a new build (most houses in my country are cold and damp turn of the century wooden cottages).\n\nAnyway, almost immediately after this Kaitlin begins making snide remarks about our soon to be child. Things like she should get a discount on rent for putting up with a baby, she\u2019s not going to get any sleep with a baby in the house, we should have told them we were trying etc. At first my wife just brushed these off, though I did have a word with Kaitlin that they\u2019re not appreciated. Since then the snide remarks became more frequent and rude, e.g., calling us selfish for bringing a child into the world, saying our social lives are going to be over, etc.\n\nAfter a couple months of this, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to put up with this kind of negativity in what will be a very stressful (but also special) time of my life. I consulted with my wife and with her support have decided to kick Kaitlin out of our house. As a flatmate without a formal signed rental agreement she actually has no tenancy rights in my country, though I still opted to give her a month to find a new place as a sign of good faith.\n\nKaitlin is throwing a hissy fit saying I\u2019m being unfair. That since she pays rent she should have a say in the direction of the household, and that we were selfish for having a kid without even telling flatmates. Alex is on the fence though has expressed that I\u2019m being a bit unfair to Kaitlin. Wife as I said fully supports me though she\u2019s less annoyed my her behaviour than myself if I\u2019m being honest.\n\nSo yeah, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672816750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102x2sy/aita_for_kicking_out_a_very_vocal_childfree/", "score": 250, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
