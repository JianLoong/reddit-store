Two bedrooms + en-suite for us to use, one bedroom each + shared bathroom for the two flatmates.\n\nOne flatmate \u201cAlex\u201d pretty much keeps to herself, the other one \u201cKaitlin\u201d (32F) is quite strongly opinionated and much more social. Kaitlin is also child-free and occasionally very vocal about it (as in, it\u2019s not constant, but when something child related comes up she will interject without fail).\n\nAnyway, wife and I were finally successful in conceiving and decided to tell both of our flatmates three months into the pregnancy. We chose three months as we didn\u2019t want to announce it to anyone too early in case of a miscarriage, but also wanted to give flatmates plenty of time to find somewhere else if they (understandably) didn\u2019t want to live with a newborn. In the end, both said they wanted to stay flatting with us as the location is good and the house is a new build (most houses in my country are cold and damp turn of the century wooden cottages).\n\nAnyway, almost immediately after this Kaitlin begins making snide remarks about our soon to be child. Things like she should get a discount on rent for putting up with a baby, she\u2019s not going to get any sleep with a baby in the house, we should have told them we were trying etc. At first my wife just brushed these off, though I did have a word with Kaitlin that they\u2019re not appreciated. Since then the snide remarks became more frequent and rude, e.g., calling us selfish for bringing a child into the world, saying our social lives are going to be over, etc.\n\nAfter a couple months of this, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to put up with this kind of negativity in what will be a very stressful (but also special) time of my life. I consulted with my wife and with her support have decided to kick Kaitlin out of our house. As a flatmate without a formal signed rental agreement she actually has no tenancy rights in my country, though I still opted to give her a month to find a new place as a sign of good faith.\n\nKaitlin is throwing a hissy fit saying I\u2019m being unfair. That since she pays rent she should have a say in the direction of the household, and that we were selfish for having a kid without even telling flatmates. Alex is on the fence though has expressed that I\u2019m being a bit unfair to Kaitlin. Wife as I said fully supports me though she\u2019s less annoyed my her behaviour than myself if I\u2019m being honest.\n\nSo yeah, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672816750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102x2sy/aita_for_kicking_out_a_very_vocal_childfree/", "score": 789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Umm, i pay for this shared space (say living room) and i did not approve of these things in here (anything baby related). Legally get rid of her. You and your wife do not need that stress when pregnancy alone is stressful enough.", "\"most houses in my country are cold and damp turn of the century wooden cottages\"\n\nFound the kiwi!\n\n*sees username* \n\n*feels smug*", "NTA\n\nBut Kaitlin is. She's as bad as those people that keep pestering couples to have children even if they don't want to, excepts she seems cruel too", "NTA. She pays rent, but it's your house. You either gotta accept the changes or leave in such situations. I pay rent to live with relatives, I sure don't try bossing them around when it comes to their house and family planning. I'm also childfree, still don't go around telling people they shouldn't have kids.", "NTA. Even with a full on tenancy agreement you\u2019d have given her more than enough time. It\u2019s your house and your responsibility is to your wife and future child not some grumpy sod who thinks she owns the place. You didn\u2019t suddenly  come home with a big vicious dog- you gave her fair warning about the baby.", "NTA. You were willing to let her stay. Literally all she had to do was keep her opinions to herself and everything would continue as it had been. That's more than fair.", "NTA\n\nShe may pay rent, but you own the home.", "NTA. You gave her enough time to find other options. It's totally unfair of her to expect you,a married couple,who WANTS a child together,to not do that based solely on her living arrangements. Her opinions on child bearing are hers alone. For her to force her perspective on you makes her the AH,not you. And you are right,why on Earth would you want that negativity around your pregnant wife and you,and your child? Tell her to get the hell out.", "NTA\n\n\nYou gave Kaitlyn the option to leave when you made the announcement. SHE opted to stay. Then when it sinks in what STAYING means, she has a problem with it. \n\nWhen you got the house was she under the impression she was going to stay long term/forever?", "NTA. You gave both flatmates SIX MONTHS notice of the impending arrival. If Kaitlyn wanted to find another place to live, she has plenty of time.", "NTA. A potential roommate a few years ago said that having kids was being selfish (as they ate our food and watched our Netflix) when we told them we were trying. I refused to let it go any further than \u201cpotential\u201d after that. We\u2019re still friends and we\u2019ll still help them if they need it, but I am not being in close proximity to attitudes like that.

Unless she's renting at a commune, I think not. Good riddance", "NTA. \"should have a say in the direction of the household\"? No. You are the owners, and all you should do is inform your renters about major changes in living situations in advance, that's all. She is delusional is she thinks you were supposed to ask for her permission to have a baby.", "Do not back down, Kaitlin is already causing issues. If you back down she will feel empowered and this will escalate. NTA", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't want her around my child.", "NTA I\u2019m laughing all of the way to the tenancy tribunal where I am setting up a popcorn stand.

You told her you were pregnant, Kaitlyn got toxic, buhbye Kaitlyn.", "NTA. Your family and the right to live in peace with your family come first.", "NTA your issue here is calling everyone flatmates and leading them to believe they have equal say, like in a house share. They are not. You are the landlords and they are lodgers. Going forward if you rent out rooms be very clear that they are not joining a house share. They are lodgers only and you are their landlord. What you say goes, the rules are yours not theirs.", "NTA she hasn't got any right to complain, you'll be relieved when she's gone. You might also want to prepare for the possibility that your other renter may not want to stay either, once the reality of having a baby in the house sets in. Things change, constantly.", "NTA. She can\u2019t both choose to stay there when you tell her about the baby, AND whinge about the baby. It\u2019s your house. It might have been a nice idea to tell them your plans, but I doubt it would have changed anything. You\u2019d still be here, and Kaitlin would still be whinging.", "Tell us you live in New Zealand without telling us you live in New Zealand. Username confirms.\n\nNTA. Totally reasonable.", "Resounding NTA!!\n\n1. Kaitlin sounds insufferable even beyond the child-free comments. Her notion that she has any say in what you have to put up with just because she pays rent is its own reason to kick her out.\n2. You have been more than accommodating. It's time to say end of discussion. She can think you are unfair all she likes... in her new apartment somewhere else.\n3. It is completely fair and your right to rid your home of a person who chooses to create a negative presence. Her argument for 'fairness' is no better than a smoker saying, \"You have to let me stay in your smoke-free home and smoke whenever I want because I find it convenient and desirable to stay here. It's not fair to inconvenience me even if I inconvenience you.\" Hah!", "NTA.  She does not get a say on when you start a family based on her living in your house", "NTA for sure. A rental discount is actually wise if you wish to retain your other lodger but who in their right mind would want to keep Kaitlin. A month\u2019s grace isn\u2019t kicking her out. It\u2019s exceedingly generous. She won\u2019t see that though.\nCongratulations on your pregnancy.", "NTA I don't care if she's constantly harassing you about your religion or your favorite tv show. She's making your home miserable. Time for her to go.", "It's your house, you can kick out whoever you want. NTA", "NTA she rents a room, but the house does not belong tl her. You\u2019re very generous to give such a snide and mean person a whole month to get out. I can tell you now that the first three months after a baby is born is HARD. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with an adult baby on top of it. Hopefully she finds a place better suited to her anti-child tastes.", "NTA. You gave her notice and this is only going to get worse as your wife gets farther along, and then absolutely horrible after the baby is born. If she wanted to keep living there she needed to learn not every view and though needs to be said out loud.", "NTA I'd have kicked her out the first time she said anything. Good for giving her 30 days notice even though its not the law. But if she stresses your wife out further and there is no such tenant law - speed it up.\n\nYou cant live like this - and you absolutely need to protect your wife and future child from this toxicity. They are tenants - you gave them 6 months notice to decide if they wanted to live with a child or not, its none of their business if you wanted to try. They had 6 months to find somewhere else to live - thats it.", "NTA... You're flatmate is the AH. How selfish and entitled can one be to expect a married couple to consult their tenants before making personal, and very foreseeable, life altering decisions?! Good riddance, I say!", "NTA don't bite hands that feeds you.", "NTA. You gave them the option to leave, she chose to stay and now wants to complain about it. At the end of the day it\u2019s your house and he can take her views and opinions elsewhere.", "So you gave them six months advance notice and offered an out and instead of *moving out* she thought it was better to whine about how you should\u2019ve considered her feelings when starting a family? And now she\u2019s all shocked pikachu that, what, you\u2019re not going to abort? What an idiot. \n\nNTA", "Wouldn\u2019t a turn of the century cottage be considered relatively new?", "NTA. You made the right choice. Your responsibility is to your own child, not to the immature Kaitlin child.", "Honestly? You helped her by kicking her out.

You did the right thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour tenant is the problem so she needs to leave because of her attitude towards your unborn baby.\n\nChange all the locks after she vacates the premises so she does not have any access in the future.\n\nMake it known that your other tenant must not pass on any keys as she is sympathetic to her leaving.\n\nI would install security cameras on all exterior doors to alert any suspicious activity from her attempting to gain entry after leaving.", "Kaitlin misses one very distinct point. You are not flatmates, she is a tenant, you the landlord. You owe her zero explanation or consideration for wishing to conceive a baby. It is YOUR house. She gets zero say. It wasn\u2019t up for a group discussion because it was quite frankly none of her damn business. Now you were considerate in letting them know they had 6 months to consider whether they wanted to stay on as tenants, or move out if living with an infant was going to be a problem for either of them. They BOTH expressed their desire to remain living in YOUR home. \n\nThat\u2019s where Kaitlin should have kept her mouth zipped. The decision was hers to make and she made it. Then she decided to try to dictate to you, her landlord, the new terms she wanted for an ongoing tenancy.

Why did she want stay when she\u2019s so anti kids?", "NTA. Sounds like you're Kiwi (username checks out). She can find another flat elsewhere in four weeks during the summer break. 4 weeks is also more than you're obliged to give, particularly after already being told her snide remarks aren't appreciated", "NTA it won't stop once the baby is born she'll probably be worse", "NTA at all. It's your house and she has no say over your family. Can't bear people who complain vocally about Everything that goes against their believes. \nAlso, she must be slow, who would want a flatmate that keeps on complaining about my life. She should've shuddup and kept to herself.", "NTA.  Kaitlin isn\u2019t in charge of your lives.", "NTA. She\u2019s a flatmate, not part of your marriage.

That since she pays rent she should have a say in the direction of the household, and that we were selfish for having a kid without even telling flatmates.\n\nThat is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard!\n\nAnd I think you better watch out for Alex too. If she thinks you are being unfair to Kaitlin, then she may agree with her and was just being less vocal. It is also possible that she hasn't actually heard some of the nonsense that Kaitin has been hitting you with. I suggest a frank discussion with her and give her an opportunity to find a place with Kaitlin.", "NTA, Kaitlin sounds like a very rude person.  No reason for her to make thise remarks to you.  She would be miserable in the house with a newborn. Kick her out, better for everyone.", "I can\u2019t believe all the NTAs here! ESH for sure. She\u2019s TA for obvious reasons that everyone else has covered.\n\nBut you and your wife are TA for trying for a baby, and not telling your flatmates.", "YTA, for this: \n\n>As a flatmate without a formal signed rental agreement she actually has no tenancy rights in my country, though I still opted to give her a month to find a new place as a sign of good faith.\n\nShe lived with you for a few years. No matter what the law is in your place, a month is a short period to vacate your residence. I know this is IATA, and yes, you would be legally in the clear, and probably also on this sub, but you should have had a more serious discussion with her and your wife, where you state that you give her 2 weeks to improve her behavior, or she'd have to move out.", "Exactly. And how is OP actually unfair? He gave her the choice to stay or not, and it would have given her 6 months before the baby arrives. She decides to stay. \n\nThen she starts injecting her opinion where its not wished. And surprise pikachu face that people don't want her in the house anymore. And somehow Alex is on the fence? Jeez.", "This, exactly.

I'm child free and glad,but I like children ( altho,I admit,my hearts actually hurts for them at times because the future IS very uncertain,but if you think about it,that's always been the case in human history. Just different scenarios. I was born in the 80s,and man,it was the best. I am lucky.) . The second kind,yes,is this woman. The very last thing she needs to do is live with a couple with a newborn. The young family needs to protect themselves and kick her butt out. She needs her own place either alone or with other like minded people.", "Kate should\u2019ve sat there and ate her food. Now her ass is homeless. It literally cost nothing to be quiet.", "About those second types you mention,  the ones who hate children and don't think they should exist - they do realize that 1.

No idea how to hold one properly.

Particularly children of people I like and want to visit. \n\nSaying I \"enjoy\" interacting with kids is a massive stretch though. I'd really rather not. I'm just not a gaping asshole which is what you have described in your \"second type\" of children people.", "She's probably the type to complain everytime OP told her he'd creampied his wife smh.", "There's a difference between antinatalists and childfree people. Antinatalist literally comes from being empathetic about life and not wanting to bring new life to experience it.
