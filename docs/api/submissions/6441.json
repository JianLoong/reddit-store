Two bedrooms + en-suite for us to use, one bedroom each + shared bathroom for the two flatmates.\n\nOne flatmate \u201cAlex\u201d pretty much keeps to herself, the other one \u201cKaitlin\u201d (32F) is quite strongly opinionated and much more social. Kaitlin is also child-free and occasionally very vocal about it (as in, it\u2019s not constant, but when something child related comes up she will interject without fail).\n\nAnyway, wife and I were finally successful in conceiving and decided to tell both of our flatmates three months into the pregnancy. We chose three months as we didn\u2019t want to announce it to anyone too early in case of a miscarriage, but also wanted to give flatmates plenty of time to find somewhere else if they (understandably) didn\u2019t want to live with a newborn. In the end, both said they wanted to stay flatting with us as the location is good and the house is a new build (most houses in my country are cold and damp turn of the century wooden cottages).\n\nAnyway, almost immediately after this Kaitlin begins making snide remarks about our soon to be child. Things like she should get a discount on rent for putting up with a baby, she\u2019s not going to get any sleep with a baby in the house, we should have told them we were trying etc. At first my wife just brushed these off, though I did have a word with Kaitlin that they\u2019re not appreciated. Since then the snide remarks became more frequent and rude, e.g., calling us selfish for bringing a child into the world, saying our social lives are going to be over, etc.\n\nAfter a couple months of this, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to put up with this kind of negativity in what will be a very stressful (but also special) time of my life. I consulted with my wife and with her support have decided to kick Kaitlin out of our house. As a flatmate without a formal signed rental agreement she actually has no tenancy rights in my country, though I still opted to give her a month to find a new place as a sign of good faith.\n\nKaitlin is throwing a hissy fit saying I\u2019m being unfair. That since she pays rent she should have a say in the direction of the household, and that we were selfish for having a kid without even telling flatmates. Alex is on the fence though has expressed that I\u2019m being a bit unfair to Kaitlin. Wife as I said fully supports me though she\u2019s less annoyed my her behaviour than myself if I\u2019m being honest.\n\nSo yeah, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672816750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102x2sy/aita_for_kicking_out_a_very_vocal_childfree/", "score": 5724, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer apartments and single-family residences are exempt\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s the same in the US unsuprisingly. You do have the right to discriminate as a live in landlord. Not sure why you\u2019re downvoting everyone. Someone renting a single family unit as an owner occupier can discriminate under the fair housing act of 1968. Just like they can in most of Europe. Again it\u2019s not a rental, it\u2019s a lodger. Living with an owner occupier is different legally, even in the US.", "It\u2019s not a rental, it\u2019s a lodger. The laws in most western countries are hugely different. A lodger can be discriminated against via sex for instance. You can refuse to allow a male lodger because you\u2019re a woman who wants a female roommate and vice versa. However most countries you cannot discriminate and refuse to rent to a certain sex. \n\nBasically as you live with them you have a lot more rights to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against a potential lodger and can evict them much easier than a renter as it\u2019s your home, not a rental. I can kick out a lodger who has a baby but I can\u2019t evict them from a rental they rent alone unless it causes over occupation (too many people in too small a flat).", "Owner-occupied and shared housing has different rules from regular rental housing. There are a few anti-discrimination laws that apply everywhere (e.g. race) but if you are sharing housing in the US (whether roommates or renting out a room in your home) you are allowed certain restrictions such as gender or adults-only that would not be allowed to a landlord renting out an entire house. Per US Federal Law (state law may vary).", "I don't know the US law, but I strongly suspect that will apply to renting a flat or a house, not to renting a room in a larger unit that you share with other people. A room is a room, not a family accommodation.\n\nWhere I live if I remember correctly you must have at least one bedroom for the parent(s) and at least one bedroom per child or per two children of the same gender, otherwise it's not deemed suitable for a family and your landlord is simply not allowed to keep renting to you.\n\nAt any rate if you're renting a room + access to common areas, you're likely to have a lease specifying that it's meant for one person only, for a couple, etc. and you have to abide by that. If you just have an informal agreement with your flatmates they probably can't force you to leave, but you can't force them to stay and share your rent either.", ">Should have told her that they were \u201ctrying\u201d to conceive.

I don't go around telling people their kids suck or pointing out all the ways their life as a parent sucks (although many parents don't extend me the same courtesy as they're constantly saying things like \"You will never know true love until you give birth to your own child!\" and \"Who will take care of you when you're old?\" and my absolute favorite, \"You think you're tired! Try having two under two!\" as if nobody else can ever be legitimately tired simply because they chose to have multiple children in short succession), I keep it to myself.\n\nThis roommate is not only obnoxious but audacious for claiming she should have some sort of say in the OP's family planning simply because they rent her a room.

They steal and distort the position of the moderates they branch off from. Just like the MAGAs stole the Republican tag and call sane Republicans RINOs", "I think people are conflating a couple things with this post. On the one side, there's being an annoying and unlikeable flatmate, and on the other there is grounds for eviction. Making snide comments, though it may be annoying, infuriating even, is not grounds for eviction. OP is explicit that the only reason this would not pose a legal issue is that there is no formal lease agreement. In other words, OP, as landlord, has proposed an informal agreement that allows them maximum flexibility, creating volatility for the tenants. If there was a formal agreement and the eviction was challenged, there's no way that \"they're making snide comments about the baby\" is going to hold up in court as grounds for eviction.\n\nLet's back up a moment. OP and wife bought a house. To help afford the mortgage, they took in two renters to live with them. Two relevant things about this situation: One, situations where tenants and landlords live on the same property are often volatile and conflict-ridden because they involve people who are explicitly understood to hold different amounts of power in relation to each other living in close quarters. OP has initiated this arrangement. Two, it means in effect that the tenants are subsidizing OP's lifestyle. \"It's OP's house,\" the chorus wails. Well, not without the tenants' help it wouldn't be.\n\nSo now OP and wife are trying to have a baby. OP has directly admitted, in a comment, that this constitutes a lower quality of life for the tenants. Okay. Well, if you're a tenant, that makes sense to be annoyed about. But, don't like it then leave, right? Well, sure, but the housing market in general does not tend toward the abundance of riches side of things; people have to settle for less than ideal situations all the time. For Kaitlin, this legitimate grievance has manifested as an annoying barrage of snide comments about your future child, which it makes sense to not want to be around. But, there is a legitimate grievance behind it. And is eviction the best answer to it?\n\nOP in a comment says that if Kaitlin had asked nicely they might have agreed to lower rent. But since Kaitlin is not being polite about it, and also happens to have some annoying beliefs, that becomes grounds for eviction? What happens if OP says \"listen, we agree to charging less rent because the situation is different from what you initially agreed to. But the comments about the baby have got to stop.\"\n\nUltimately, I just don't think there's an easy way to have your cake and eat it too, in terms of profiting off of people's need for housing by having them live on your property with you, while also guaranteeing that there won't be conflict due to one flatmate being The Boss over another. Is that a hard situation for a homeowner and to-be family man? Yes. Is it a hard situation for the renters as well? Yes.", "I wish there was a third term, because I don't have children and don't want them.

I don't ask her to babysit or diaper, but when family gathers she hangs out with them, etc etc. She will read them a story because she's their Aunt; I DONT expect her to read them to sleep at night at the expense of heading out with her friends. \n\nI  do wish more people with kids could just accept the CF position and not push- \"oh you'll change your mind\" is not a respectful way to respond to anyone's stated lifestyle habits. Maybe thst would help the toxic CF stuff. But those in my life who are CF are very cool people who have just made a different decision. \n\nI absolutely admit I'm looking forward to seeing them more once my kids are less needy/messy/poopy lol, but who blames another adult for not being psyched at the idea of having peas thrown at their head during dinner?"]}
