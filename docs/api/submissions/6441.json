{"id": 6441, "submission_id": "102x2sy", "title": "AITA for kicking out a very vocal child-free flatmate after my wife got pregnant?", "selftext": "Basically my wife and I (29M/24F) bought our own house a couple of years ago, and got two flatmates in to help pay the mortgage. Two bedrooms + en-suite for us to use, one bedroom each + shared bathroom for the two flatmates.\n\nOne flatmate \u201cAlex\u201d pretty much keeps to herself, the other one \u201cKaitlin\u201d (32F) is quite strongly opinionated and much more social. Kaitlin is also child-free and occasionally very vocal about it (as in, it\u2019s not constant, but when something child related comes up she will interject without fail).\n\nAnyway, wife and I were finally successful in conceiving and decided to tell both of our flatmates three months into the pregnancy. We chose three months as we didn\u2019t want to announce it to anyone too early in case of a miscarriage, but also wanted to give flatmates plenty of time to find somewhere else if they (understandably) didn\u2019t want to live with a newborn. In the end, both said they wanted to stay flatting with us as the location is good and the house is a new build (most houses in my country are cold and damp turn of the century wooden cottages).\n\nAnyway, almost immediately after this Kaitlin begins making snide remarks about our soon to be child. Things like she should get a discount on rent for putting up with a baby, she\u2019s not going to get any sleep with a baby in the house, we should have told them we were trying etc. At first my wife just brushed these off, though I did have a word with Kaitlin that they\u2019re not appreciated. Since then the snide remarks became more frequent and rude, e.g., calling us selfish for bringing a child into the world, saying our social lives are going to be over, etc.\n\nAfter a couple months of this, I decided that I didn\u2019t want to put up with this kind of negativity in what will be a very stressful (but also special) time of my life. I consulted with my wife and with her support have decided to kick Kaitlin out of our house. As a flatmate without a formal signed rental agreement she actually has no tenancy rights in my country, though I still opted to give her a month to find a new place as a sign of good faith.\n\nKaitlin is throwing a hissy fit saying I\u2019m being unfair. That since she pays rent she should have a say in the direction of the household, and that we were selfish for having a kid without even telling flatmates. Alex is on the fence though has expressed that I\u2019m being a bit unfair to Kaitlin. Wife as I said fully supports me though she\u2019s less annoyed my her behaviour than myself if I\u2019m being honest.\n\nSo yeah, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672816750, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102x2sy/aita_for_kicking_out_a_very_vocal_childfree/", "score": 60, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One just doesn\u2019t wish to have children, but they accept that children are a part of life and usually enjoy interacting with kids.

Kaitlin needs to get over herself.", "If you live with a young, married couple then it is reasonable to accept that they will likely be having children at some time and need more space. It is not a permanent solution - and you don't get a say in whether they have sex or use birth control. You are a renter not part of the core household. Sounds like those lines got blurred. Been in similar situation and when landlady started dating seriously, I did have a chat just to check if I needed to start looking for new accommodation. It was anxiety causing but part of life. \n\nThis renter was reassured she didn't need to do that if could tolerate a new born.

You own the house, so if someone is going, obviously she is the one who needs to go.\n\nAs long as you gave reasonable notice to vacate and are within any applicable regulations where you live, you're good.\n\nIf your other tenant has a problem with this, perhaps you should find out whether she also wishes to move. After all, it is easier to advertize both rooms at the same time rather than going through the interview process twice while getting ready for a baby.\n\nFWIW, I am also child-free by choice. If I found it unacceptable to share a home with an infant, I would have a look at the rental market, consider my budget, then inform you of my intent to move out so that you had notice to consider new tenants. (But, assuming I got on well with the other tenant, I might ask what her feelings were on the baby and explore whether we could find another shared situation if she was also thinking of moving.)\n\nNow, if you knew *before* renting rooms in your home that you were trying to start a family and didn't disclose that, you would be AH or at least AH-adjacent.", "NTA for wanting her out, it's your home and if she is bringing the tone down then sure, I hope you've clearly explained why she has to go, but why were you trying for a baby when you can't afford to actually run the whole house without flatmates?", "NTA \n\nWhat????
