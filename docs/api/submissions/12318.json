I\u2019m not really on board with this plan for a few reasons.\n\nFirstly, they\u2019re having some serious relationship issues. They both have some baggage from their past relationships, and it's like their issues just make things worse for each other. In my opinion, they really need to work on their relationship before we all start living together under the same roof.\n\nAlso, when my mom and S get into arguments, my mom tends to take her frustration out on me. I really don't want to deal with that, so I think it's best for everyone if they sort out their problems first.\n\nSecondly, I barely even know S. I\u2019ve only met his kids (12f & 6m) like 6 times and I\u2019ve only known him for about half a year. And honestly, my impression of him hasn\u2019t been great so far. He got a dog (husky) that I now fully take care of, this dog is destructive and aggressive (he does nothing ab it), I have had gashes down my arms and bruises everywhere from the dog. S also doesn\u2019t clean up after himself or do anything for himself if my mom is there.\n\nLastly, I really don\u2019t want to share a room. I know this might sound spoiled, but I\u2019ve been sharing a room with my sister (9) for as long as I can remember, and when I heard we are moving in with S, I was hoping to finally have my own space. But nope, I\u2019ll be sharing with S\u2019s 12-yr old who I barely even know. And the other two kids will each have their own rooms.\n\nNormally, I wouldn\u2019t care about this kind of thing if it was a financial issue, but the only reason we\u2019re not all getting our own rooms is because there aren\u2019t any 5-bedroom houses available in the area they want to live in.  \n\nI feel a little entitled to my own space. I\u2019m the oldest, I take care of all the pets and my sister (have for years b4 S was around), and S\u2019s oldest kid is only with him for 4 days a month.\n\nI talked to my mom about all of this because she really wanted to know my opinion, but she ended up getting really upset with me and saying that I\u2019m not supportive of her happiness and that how their relationship is going isn\u2019t my business. And when I brought it up with my aunt for another opinion, she said it was kind of an ah thing to say and that I could\u2019ve just gone along with it because my mom was finally in a happy/healthy relationship.", "created_utc": 1678848369, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rjts1/aita_for_not_wanting_to_move_in_together_share_a/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't make an ounce of sense why 16 and 12 yo would share a room while a 9 and 6 yo each have their own. If I read this correctly, I guess it's because she is only there 4 days a month? But, even so. \n\nAs a 16 year old having some autonomy is super important and you should try to have a civilized discussion with your mom about it. It doesn't sound like she actually cares whether you like S or want them to move in together or anything like that, so try to make the situation as good as possible for yourself. Aside from your age, as you said, pulling a significant amount of household weight should also entitle you to a better room situation.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry that you have to be the adult voice of reason at 16.", "NTA - Seriously, you aren\u2019t responsible for your mother\u2019s happiness. Your mother should sacrifice romantic relationships for YOU, not vice versa. \n\nGrowing up my mom was always side-lining us and asking us to compromise for some sh*t man. Don\u2019t do it. You definitely deserve that room and you shouldn\u2019t be sharing a room with a 12 year old you don\u2019t know. If that\u2019s what ends up happening, all I can say is, sorry OP\n\nIt\u2019s likely that being collected and calculated about this situation will get you further than making demands. Make a plan\u2014gather facts and statics. Appeal to their ethos, logos, and pathos. Show them you\u2019re serious about this. Good luck.", "NTA, get a part time job as soon as you can and start saving to GTFO. Your mom, aunt are putting her supposed \"happiness\" above that ofyou and your sister and he is putting his avoce his kids as well. This can't be easy for any of you to be forced into the middle of.", "NTA. Your mom also needs to be supportive of your happiness. Just because she's the mom doesn't mean that her preferences matter more than yours. Sharing a room with a stranger is hard. If two families are merging, it's important for everyone to talk through how it can best work for everyone, not just for adults. What everyone cares about and needs.\n\nYou're a person. Kids are people. Your views matter. I don't think it's fair that your mom isn't thinking about you more and having better conversations with you about the whole situation. This is a huge change in your life.", "NTA. At all. But it doesn't sound like your mom is going to listen. I don't understand why you can't have your own room and the two middle kids share? That seems like the most reasonable arrangement anyway. Also, fwiw, your aunt is also wrong. You're a child, you shouldn't need to protect your mom from your opinions when she asks; she should be protecting *you.*", "> I\u2019m not supportive of her happiness and that how their relationship is going isn\u2019t my business\n\nIt is absolutely you're business when you, and three other kids, are being dragged along for the ride. The state of a parent's relationship or marriage directly involves the kids, biological or otherwise. \n\nWhen her relationship is rocky, you are her scapegoat. It's your business. \n\nBut honestly, what on earth is your mother thinking??? \n\nThis is outrageous and so unhealthy. When you have legitimate concerns, a parent needs to take a step back and think these over. Your comfort and safety should be the priority. You are not comfortable with this man you hardly know, or his kids, and that's incredibly valid. \n\nWhy should you be thrown into a home with them? \n\nI do think of all the kids, the oldest, a teenager, should have their own room and privacy. I don't think that's the biggest issue here, though. \n\nI'm sorry you're in this position and having to be the responsible person. I hope your mum can come to her senses.", "NTA. \n\n>saying that I\u2019m not supportive of her happiness and that how their relationship is going isn\u2019t my business. \n\nThis may sound surprising, but experts say that it's the mom that should be supportive of the kids'. Crazy, huh? Who knew", "NTA. You need to sabotage this relationship. Become a nightmare to all of them.", "NTA, your Mom sure is though. I\u2019ve seen a few parents that absolutely prioritized themselves over their children and it never gets less frustrating. You\u2019re a parent, you chose to have children, guess what comes first?", "NTA. Your mom should be taking your feelings into consideration here too, not just her own. As a 16 year old girl, I\u2019d feel very uncomfortable living in the same house with a strange man. You absolutely need your own room at the very least. Your mom should know this! What\u2019s wrong with her? Do you have any options of other places to live?", "NTA. Why can\u2019t the 12 and 9 year olds share?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get a job as soon as you can. Save up and move out at 18. Don\u2019t have kids. Build an awesome life for yourself. \n\nHuskies have a ton of energy. They can\u2019t just be walked.

They are always delusional and thinking that they are making the family happy when in reality they are making their own selves happy.
