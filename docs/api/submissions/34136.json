{"id": 34136, "submission_id": "18wjbum", "title": "AITAH for telling a girl what my friend said about her", "selftext": "I(16f) got into a fight with a girl who used to be my friend(16f), this friend of mine had always been a pretty bad friend to me, was always trying to bring me down to make her feel better about herself, and would use her mental illness as an excuse for the way she treated everyone. Was constantly taking shit about anyone and everyone including girls I was friends with. It kinda culminated when she kept saying that me and another friend of mine were dating and this friend of mine was super uncomfortable with this idea so I would always tell her to stop. She would then make more fun of us and none of our others friends would step in and defend us. Well this year i ended up getting tired of how this friend was treating me and was still cordial with her but decided not to be super close. \n\nBefore I decided to do this there was a moment last spring when she was talking about another girl who she was super good friends( I\u2019ll call her S) with and said \u201cS is so stupid she won\u2019t ever get into any college\u201d. In the moment I probably didn\u2019t do enough and just told her that that wasn\u2019t a nice thing to say, she replied with \u201cit\u2019s true though, she takes the easiest classes and gets bad grades so she\u2019d be lucky to get in anywhere . Then one day during this fall S came up to be and told me that she had heard that this friend of mine had been saying bad things about her and asked me to tell her what she said. I debated on it and in the moment decided that I would tell her. And I did. \n\nAbout a week later my friend and S were at a party together and got into a huge fight over what I told S, my friend then texted me that night and told me it was none of my business and that I was an awful friend and that I was a terrible person. We texted a little back and forth and I thought I had at least semi solved it but the next day, she texted me again(and I know she was at a sleepover with a bunch of girls I considered close friends) telling me that I was a huge bitch and she said \u201c you think your so perfect your an terrible person and say things about your friends so you have no right to criticize me\u201d. I didn\u2019t respond as I knew this wasn\u2019t true because I would never say something like that about one of my close friends but it only kept getting worse, she kept texting me paragraphs about how I\u2019d betrayed her and etc. I never replied to any of her texts and we haven\u2019t talked since. It\u2019s kinda awkward at school and I\u2019m not sure if I did the right thing\u2026should I reach out to her?\nAlso I know this is probably petty high school drama that doesn\u2019t matter but I don\u2019t wanna be a bad person so if I\u2019m wrong I wanna apologize", "created_utc": 1704179152, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wjbum/aitah_for_telling_a_girl_what_my_friend_said/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
