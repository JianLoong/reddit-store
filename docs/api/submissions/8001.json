I had him with my ex, Matthew 36M. \n\nMatthew was abusive and he dumped me as soon as I got pregnant and refused to get a abortion. He then moved on to another girl, Serena (25F now) and did basically the same thing to her. She has a daughter, Haley 6F. \n\nWhen my son was three, I reached out to Serena on FB so our children could know eachother. One thing lead to another and we moved in together a year later to help eachother raise our kids. A few years after that, we started dating eachother and we're engaged now. Her family treat me like I'm one of them which is amazing because I'm estranged from my own.\n\nMatthew's mother, Iris (60F), is now trying to reach out to us to get to know our children. When I became pregnant all those years ago, she refused to help me in anyway and she wouldn't hold her son accountable for his actions. However when Serena was pregnant, she was very happy to help her and play grandma to Haley. This is because Serena and Matthew (and by extension his mother) are from the same country while I am not. When Serena and I moved in together, Iris was still only interested in being a grandma to Haley but that didn't sit right with Serena so she cut her off. \n\nSomehow (from extreme Facebook sleuthing I suspect), Iris has found out that Serena and I are engaged. She messaged Serena and asked if she could see both of the kids. Serena agreed to a phone call with her first and Iris sounded much more eager about seeing Haley again as opposed to meeting Milo for the first time. She swore that she wasn't in contact with her son anymore and she was lonely and wanted to get to know her grandchildren. \n\nEventually, we agreed to all go out for lunch together. The kids enjoyed it but once again, it was obvious she was happier to see Haley. When we got home that evening, we decided to not meet her again and Serena sent a message explaining why. Iris freaked out and spam called us a million times and sent us many hateful messages saying that she needs time to warm up to Milo. I even received an email to my work email from **Matthew** calling me heartless for doing that to his mother. My work email is easily accessible from my works website and he probably googled my name to find it.\n\nThe reasoning behind my decision was the fact that Milo has already faced rejection from my family. I cut them off when he was four, but in the years before that he watched his cousins get treated so much better than he was because my family hated me for being a teen mom. Serena's family has accepted him with open arms but I can't bear the thought of him being treated as second again so that's why I chose to cut off Iris. Her explanation/excuse is that she regrets how she refused to meet him before and she just needs time to get to know him which makes no sense because Haley doesn't remember her at all, so she's basically at the same place with both kids.\n\nI'd love an unbiased opinion on this.
