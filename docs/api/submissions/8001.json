I had him with my ex, Matthew 36M. \n\nMatthew was abusive and he dumped me as soon as I got pregnant and refused to get a abortion. He then moved on to another girl, Serena (25F now) and did basically the same thing to her. She has a daughter, Haley 6F. \n\nWhen my son was three, I reached out to Serena on FB so our children could know eachother. One thing lead to another and we moved in together a year later to help eachother raise our kids. A few years after that, we started dating eachother and we're engaged now. Her family treat me like I'm one of them which is amazing because I'm estranged from my own.\n\nMatthew's mother, Iris (60F), is now trying to reach out to us to get to know our children. When I became pregnant all those years ago, she refused to help me in anyway and she wouldn't hold her son accountable for his actions. However when Serena was pregnant, she was very happy to help her and play grandma to Haley. This is because Serena and Matthew (and by extension his mother) are from the same country while I am not. When Serena and I moved in together, Iris was still only interested in being a grandma to Haley but that didn't sit right with Serena so she cut her off. \n\nSomehow (from extreme Facebook sleuthing I suspect), Iris has found out that Serena and I are engaged. She messaged Serena and asked if she could see both of the kids. Serena agreed to a phone call with her first and Iris sounded much more eager about seeing Haley again as opposed to meeting Milo for the first time. She swore that she wasn't in contact with her son anymore and she was lonely and wanted to get to know her grandchildren. \n\nEventually, we agreed to all go out for lunch together. The kids enjoyed it but once again, it was obvious she was happier to see Haley. When we got home that evening, we decided to not meet her again and Serena sent a message explaining why. Iris freaked out and spam called us a million times and sent us many hateful messages saying that she needs time to warm up to Milo. I even received an email to my work email from **Matthew** calling me heartless for doing that to his mother. My work email is easily accessible from my works website and he probably googled my name to find it.\n\nThe reasoning behind my decision was the fact that Milo has already faced rejection from my family. I cut them off when he was four, but in the years before that he watched his cousins get treated so much better than he was because my family hated me for being a teen mom. Serena's family has accepted him with open arms but I can't bear the thought of him being treated as second again so that's why I chose to cut off Iris. Her explanation/excuse is that she regrets how she refused to meet him before and she just needs time to get to know him which makes no sense because Haley doesn't remember her at all, so she's basically at the same place with both kids.\n\nI'd love an unbiased opinion on this.

Your caution seems wise to me.", "Matthew is basically a sperm donor at this point, so no I think you\u2019re NTA for not allowing his mother to see the kids based on how she acted towards them. If you have the money for it, you should speak with a family law attorney about the whole situation to make sure you\u2019re\nprotected.", "NTA You and Serena hold the line for your kids and have a great life. I would point out that gma lied to you about being in contact with her son. They obviously communicate. Perhaps you might consider having a lawyer contact him back about child support. Up to you guys.", "NTA. protect your child first and foremost, momma bear.", "We thought about it for a bit but he could pursue visitation rights, and he's actually crazy so we'd prefer him to not see them", "Then you might seek to have his parental rights revoked so that you don\u2019t have to face future disruption from him and his family. Mother says she\u2019s not in contact with her son, but somehow he heard all about the meeting with his mother? Protect your baby. Good luck. NTA", "If documented crazy, could get a restraining order to prevent visitation. But would need to consult a lawyer about it and the process.\n\nCould also include his entire family in the mix based upon how they are treating both of them and the differences.", "Also something else to consider depending on the state the children were born in. He may not have parental rights as is but could still be liable for child support.\n\nHe'd have to prove him self worthy of being in the child's life to be granted parental rights.", "You know she lied about nit being in contact with him, right?", "NTA. You are doing what\u2019s best for your son, and your family. Iris made her decision not to be in Milo\u2019s life or help you in any way, and when you let her back into your lives it was apparent that she only wanted access to Haley. Having no grandparents is better than having toxic ones, and it\u2019s good you have your in-laws.  You don\u2019t owe the sperm donor or his mother anything. Let Milo know your feelings and why you are protecting him, and that when he\u2019s an adult and chooses to reach out, it\u2019s his choice.", "NTA\n\nSo Matthew, who was well into his late twenties, got a teen girl pregnant, and then up and left. Then, as a thirty year old, did the SAME THING to another teenage girl?!?!? What the fuck is wrong with this dude! Were you or your fiance even 18 when y'all started dating? This guy is a predator! \n\n\nHis mom clearly has no interest in holding her creepy son accountable. On top of that she treats your son differently solely because you're not from her country? I wouldn't allow her near the children at all either. Any connection to that family is a connection to Matthew, and he and his mother are unhinged. \n\n\nCongrats on the engagement! I would encourage both of you to look into revoking any parental rights Matthew may have. He's a creep and his mother is an enabler. She should have had an issue with the fact that her son was preying on young girls! Not where those girls are from!", "MIL had her chance and blew it. She doesn't get to fuck you and your little boy over a second time.\n\nIt sounds as though your life has been pretty happy and stable without MIL, or your ex, in it and from what you've written, there seems little likelihood that their presence would make your life better.\n\nMaintain NC, continue protecting your son and enjoy your life with your new partner and her family. You finally seemed to have struck gold with them. Don't trade it for a bucket full of lead.", "Grandma dearest has an agenda.", "Wait til Milo is 17 and go after back child support.

Get a lawyer or Milo will be getting the short end of the stick without you even there to protect him.\n\nAlso be prepared for Milo to face rejection if Hayley chooses to have a relationship with her grandma when she is older. Do as much as you can to protect him while you can.\n\nHope grandma and deadbeat dad go away", "He's not on either birth certificate but we'll consult a lawyer to be safe. Thank you!!", "NTA  \nIt is our job as parents to stand as a pillar between children an all that seeks to hurt them. A safe harbor for them no matter how hard the storm may be. This way they can be confident and explore the world knowing there's always a safe space they can come back to.   \nMilo's safe space is far more valuable than Iris's hurt feelings. You clearly have forgiven her, but a lot of people tend to confuse forgiving with forgetting.

Keep the kids away from Iris.", "Literally I was like keep these poor 18 year olds away from him! \n\nWe can assume there's at least a few months of beforehand these girls before he knocks them up so it's this grown man out here flirting with minors and getting them pregnant the moment they turn 18?", "That's what I was thinking!!! Clearly it's a pattern and like you said, there HAS to be some time beforehand that they are dating/talking. If you also consider that most abusers don't show their true colors straight away, and they were in a relationship long enough for it to become abusive... It makes me wonder if OP was 17 when they got together, pregnant at 18, and had the child at 19. It's perfectly plausible.", "God yes.  Make sure you consult an experienced Family Law practitioner before you make a move and be sure of exactly what you hope to accomplish. People who talk about terminating parental rights usually don't have a single clue of what they are talking about (speaking from 35 years of Family Court experience, although IANA lawyer.) Once he's the legal father he won't be that easy to get rid of.", "NTA at all and can I just say that I am LIVING for your queer love story. Fuck Matthew and his mom."]}
