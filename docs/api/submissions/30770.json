Sounds like one of yours is \u201cno dating apps on phones if we are dating.\u201d That\u2019s a reasonable boundary to have and many many other people share that view within their relationships. \n\nWhere we tip over the edge is you trying to control her and what she does to bring her \u201cin line\u201d with YOUR boundary. And that\u2019s not really how boundaries work. If she has crossed yours you have every right to say that your boundary has been crossed and what your feelings are about that. However, she then has every right to not comply if she doesn\u2019t agree with your stance. You following me so far?\n\nThe next step is not to control her actions to \u201cturn her more into\u201d someone you want to be in a relationship with. The next step in boundaries is for you to say \u201cthat\u2019s a boundary of mine and is a deal breaker for me.\u201d And be prepared for the fact that it makes you incompatible for a relationship together. Accept that truth and then both of you can move on to find something and someone that is a better fit for you. \n\nOverall I\u2019m going with NAH. you\u2019re both just stating and standing by your viewpoints.
