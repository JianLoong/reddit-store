Don't let them step all over you like that!", "NTA. They are abusing you financially and are probably guilt tripping you on a regular basis for things that should be their responsibility. They are two adults with a child and live rent free. What the heck are they doing all day and where does their money go to?", "NTA tell her that you gave her the phone - not the boyfriend- so that she would stop using your personal device. Tell her that if she isn\u2019t using the phone you have her you\u2019re going to return it considering she\u2019s still taking yours. That\u2019ll change her entitled tune real quick", "NTA - put a new password/fingerprint/whatever on your phone and tell your sister that yours is now off limits. She should use her own or figure out how to share with her partner. It seems you're letting them walk all over you and it's about time you set some boundaries.", "NTA\nDont buy him aswell! thats just stupid! she is using you, dont give her your phone anymore", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s old enough to work to pay for her own electronics. It\u2019s your personal property, if she damages them you could easily take her to a small claims court. Keep them far away from your electronics, just because y\u2019all live together it doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s entitled to your stuff.", "NTA- Stop letting your sister mooch off of you. She's an adult just like her boy friend and have a child, they should be working for the things that they need. You already pay for a lot of stuff that they live off of but they don't contribute to. If the boy friend needs a phone then he should get one and not take the one you bought for your sister.", "NTA \n\nYou are being used. It\u2019s not your responsibility to buy two grown ass people phones!

Even though she's a bad person with no empathy who is putting you in the same position of having privacy invaded and mooching off you, I would still get her bf one, just for my peace of mind.\n\nThat being said, other than that, you need to urgently stop enabling them and see if you can get them to contribute.\n\nCheck this out: https://youtu.be/q225u22Qn1g", "NTA.\n\nIs she using it to make calls or for smartphone apps and such? I imagine they're probably using the phone to entertain themselves or their kid?\n\nI personally wouldn't care about the bf, but if you wanted to go the extra mile and also just for ease I'd get them like a Galaxy Tab A7 tablet for apps and stuff. It's not a phone but if they're borrowing (stealing) your phone constantly for games/YT/tik tok or to entertain their kid, it's a $100 tablet that they can use to leave you the fuck alone. They can use Google Voice/fb video calling/whatsapp to communicate and they still have the phone you've already given them for actual phone calls.\n\nAnother way to address it would be to discuss getting them another smart device but ask her to pay for it. Don't get me wrong, this should be an amount you're willing to write off, not something you should depend on her paying you back for. But if they're full on mooching, it's a way to start to set boundaries and let them know you're helping them but it's not forever and they don't get to keep pushing for more without starting to contribute.", "NTA and move out, your already paying all the bills so no difference there. They're using you and your stuff for their own gains. Don't buy her boyfriend anything and stop giving out for no reason. They're adults too and need to do their share", "NTA.

Maybe it's time for her to move out, or start contributing to the household expenses.\n\nPerhaps get the bf a very low spec'd cheap phone so he'll have his own.  Sometimes you can pick up run out models for as low as $20.  But I suspect this won't go down well.", "Nta and stop enabling them", "Please for the love of god put a lock code on your phone.

(If you're paying for the plan, you can get involved, but if she's paying for it, it's their problem.)   \nYou gave her a phone. Stop loaning her yours. If that's a problem she needs to work it out with the BF who has a kind of taker vibe going on.", "YTA for being taken advantage of, tell her get a damn job or let her bf get some money and buy their own stuff, the more you give them the more angry they will make you!"]}
