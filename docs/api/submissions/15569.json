In general anytime my husband (27m) or I (27f) have asked my mom (48f) and dad (54m) to watch our daughter (2f) they are busy. Even if we try to plan something a month in advance. My parents live 2 and a half hours away and we for the most part drive to visit them instead of them coming to us which is a lot with two kids but we are fine with that because we don\u2019t visit too often because of the drive. Anyways my parents retired and decided they would go back to work at low commitment jobs in a small rural area just to keep busy. \n\nRecently my husbands grandmother passed away and we needed to find childcare for our toddler for the wake because it is 4 hours long and there\u2019s no way she would sit through that. We will be taking her to the funeral the next day however. Both of us were close with his grandmother and we both want to be there so I asked my parents if they wouldn\u2019t mind watching their granddaughter for a few hours. My mom just said she can\u2019t and my dad said he was the only manager in that day so he couldn\u2019t either.\n\nBoth of my parents are still involved in our life like my mom will buy our daughters clothes and my dad is really handy so he helped us replace our roof and is helping us renovate our laundry room so I know they love us and our daughters I just thought the dynamic of theirs and our daughters relationship would be different.\n\nI also want to say when my husband and I had kids we were not assuming anyone would watch our kids and we know we are not entitled to my parents watching our kids. I just see other people with kids being able to occasionally leave their kids with their parents and my husbands parents ask almost every Sunday if they can watch the girls for a bit because they love spending time with them and I feel like I\u2019m missing out on something.\n\nIn any other situation where they have said they can\u2019t watch our kids I just shrug it off but in this case it\u2019s for a wake for a family member passing away and while I haven\u2019t said anything to them I just feel a bit peeved they aren\u2019t trying to help us at least in this instance\u2026 AITA?\n\n**UPDATE: I should mention we were able to find a friend who could watch our daughter for a few hours so childcare is handled.\n\nIm not close to any of my extended family because of disagreements my parents have had with them in the past so they\u2019ve been cut off and I\u2019ve been looped into that so the only family I have regular contact with is my husbands and they all will be at the wake obviously. I just would like for my parents to have a more involved relationship with our daughters.\n\n**UPDATE: for everyone saying to take the hint that they don\u2019t want to watch our children. We visited my parents this past weekend and they said if we need anything to let them know so I mentioned once we know more details we possibly might need them to watch our daughter during the wake and they said \u201cof course we will figure it out\u201d. Once we got home and got more details I texted them the time we would need them and they said they can\u2019t.

Time to take the hint - your parents don\u2019t want to babysit. You should be working in building a network of childcare options that don\u2019t involve them. Make sure you have paid options so that you don\u2019t keep going to your parents and making them give the inevitable no. I understand that some parents help - my parents are available nearly 24/7 to my my sibling. But that\u2019s a choice, not an obligation.", "I'm going to say NTA and I hope it makes sense.\n\nOP has provided more than enough information to paint a clear picture that she does not feel entitled to childcare from her parents as everything stands now. She isn't arguing with her parents that they need to watch her kids. She isn't showing up on their doorstep trying to unload the kids. Nothing like that.\n\nOP is telling us that her parents have a history of planning to watch the kids and they always flake out. I don't think they are AHs for that part, per se.\n\nIn this specific situation, I do think is OPs parents offered to help. OP told them she'd let them know when they'd need help. OPs parents said \"of course we will figure it out\". To me that did not imply they would just say tell you \"no\". That implied somewhere in the realm of \"we will make it work\". So no your parents aren't AHs for not wanting to be more involved with the kids than they are, but I think they are AHs for implying that would be able to help and then flaking out. If this was a one off it would be more understandable, but her parents have a history of what sounds like broken promises.\n\nThe real problem here is that OP needs to stop trying to rely on them. Don't even consider them an option. They don't want to help and are only disappointing you further. You need to change your expectations of them, because for 1) it's not fair to your parents, and 2) you're making yourself upset over trying to force your parents to be like your ILs when it comes to your children.\n\nI know people will disagree with this take, but to me it sounds reasonable based on the information.", "*while I haven\u2019t said anything to them I just feel a bit peeved they aren\u2019t trying to help us at least in this instance\u2026 AITA?*\n\nIf you had said anything to them, you would be the a-hole. Feelings are feelings but how you act on them is what determines my vote around here. \n\nThat said, make peace with the fact that your parents can love you deeply but just not be interesting in the babysitting potential of their role as grandparents. My MIL announced at my baby shower that she was \"all done raising kids\" and I took her at her word. Our kids had a warm-fuzzy relationship with my parents at their house and a monthly visit (with us present) at my in-laws. My husband was deeply disappointed (for a good long while) but accepted that his parents level of involvement with our kids was their choice, not ours. \n\nYour parents might come to regret this later when the kids get older, but that's THIER consequence to deal with. Not yours. \n\nNAH.", "NAH. It\u2019s normal to wish the grandparents would want to watch their grandkids however, you should just secure a sitter at this point because it is clear they don\u2019t want to babysit. I\u2019d be curious if it\u2019s based on your child\u2019s age/behavior or if they just don\u2019t like the idea of babysitting at this stage in their lives.

Okay, OP's parents are not interested in babysitting and that is their right. Understood. OP says herself she knows she's not entitled to childcare from them. But OP just lost someone important to her and her parents come across as people who don't really show their daughter any empathy or willingness to help her out. OP is right to feel sad her parents are not interested in HELPING. This is not about childcare per se. It's sad to not be able to rely on your family and your feelings are valid to that effect.

NTA. i\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that.", "It's okay to be disappointed but it sounds like they haven't exactly been subtle about turning down watching the kid up until now.

I'm sure grandparents will remember how nice it was when family helped out. \n\nYou're not an AH for asking for help OP.", "NAH you now know your parents will not be there to help you out in emergency situations. You need to reevaluate your relationship with them. When they get older & need your help, don\u2019t feel guilty saying no. Put your child & your spouse first.", "Yeah, I agree with pretty much everyone else.\n\nThe thing here is that it seems your parents have made it super clear they don't want to babysit. It's pretty clear they are supportive and care about you and your family, but not all grandparents like to babysit. It's their choice and you should just accept it.\n\nI would say just never ask again, wait until they ask you. Maybe when your kids are older they will be more interested?

As an example, you have a friend who can't just have a drink or two with friends, they always end up getting totally drunk and making a scene or starting a fight and you end up having to babysit them to make sure that they don't hurt themselves or someone else. It happens every time. So, you can keep inviting them out with you and keep getting upset that they ruin your night out.

It seems weird to me that they wouldn't want personal bonding time with your kids and I think that is what is really bothering you. They don't seem to go out of their way to build a close bond with your children and one day they might be a little sour when they hear your kids talk about the other grandparents being their favorite. It's ok to voice your disappointment with the current state of the effort your parents are putting in with the relationship of your children.

If they own it cool, but it's a jerk move to ask the world to support the delusion that you would totally do this if only.....", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s an AH for being upset her parents won\u2019t watch their grandkid so they can go to a WAKE. That\u2019s pretty shitty.", "The parents have helped them out on a new roof, and other renovations \u2014 so clearly they are helping. They just can\u2019t/ don\u2019t want to babysit.", "We had just got back from visiting them this past weekend and before we left I said \u201conce we know more details do you mind possibly watching our daughter for a bit during the wake\u201d and they said they would make it work so when I texted them when we got home about when we would need them to watch her they said they can\u2019t.", "But the parents expecting OP and her husband to constantly travel 5 hours round trip to visit the parents (with 2 little kids in the car) is reasonable?", "I mentioned in the post I know I am not entitled to their childcare hence why I found a friend to watch our daughter. I just would prefer my parents to watch our daughter because I want them to be involved in their grandchild\u2019s life. We don\u2019t usually ask them to watch our daughters anymore but this was a different situation of a family member passing away so we had very limited options.", "My husbands grandmother passed away Saturday and the wake is Wednesday. We were visiting my parents house this weekend when we found out so they said if we need anything to let them know so I mentioned once we know more details we might need them to watch our daughter during the wake and they said \u201cof course we will make it work\u201d then when we got home and found out more details I let them know the time and they said they can\u2019t.", "There\u2019s a big difference between visiting your grandchildren and babysitting them. My grandparents never babysat me as a child but I spent lots of time with them and still have a good relationship with those who are still living. Providing childcare should not be the requirement for having a relationship with someone.", "> NTA, but neither are they.\n\nThis should be NAH then.", "I mentioned in the post in an update that we found alternate childcare arrangements because we did have a back up. Also, mentioned in an update I was hurt that when I asked my parents once we had more details if there was a possibility of them watching our daughter, they said of course and they would figure it out and then once we got home and I texted them a time they said they couldn\u2019t.", "I'm confused about your confusion. It sounds like refusing to babysit is a regular thing with your parents.\n\nYes, it's nice when grandparents help out. I understand why you are jealous of people who have that. But your parents aren't like that. I would stop asking them.\n\nAppreciate what they actually do for you.", "\u2026this isn\u2019t an emergency, though.", "*they said they would make it work*\n\nOkay, THAT was an a-hole move on their part, but the overall vibe of them not wanting to watch the kids is something you're just going to have to make peace with.", "How many times do they need to say \u201cno\u201d before you understand?  Yta", ">I know I am not entitled to their childcare, but feel entitled to it anyway.\n\nFixed that for you", "Here\u2019s where the disconnect lies. Your parents can be involved in your children\u2019s lives by having Christmas together, holidays, coming for birthday parties, having phone calls and FaceTime chats. There are so many ways that your parents can be involved in your children\u2019s lives.\n\nYour parents don\u2019t need to take your children into their home, and have full-time responsibility of them for hours or days in order for your children to bond with them. They can have one on one time with them when they come to visit in your home or you bring them to their home for a visit.\n\nThem not wanting to babysit DOES NOT MEAN they don\u2019t want to bond with your children. There is no connection between the two.", "**\"I just would prefer my parents to watch our daughter because I want them to be involved in their grandchild\u2019s life.\"** \n\nSounds like the only thing you considered being involved in your children's life is for them to provide childcare. That is probably WHY they do not visit you!\n\nFind a location halfway between your homes to meet and make plans to do something there. Some of my best childhood memories were family picnics. We lived 3 hours from my grandparents and found a simple rest area around the halfway point. We spent much time there.", "You would have gotten a lot of different responses if you put that bit in your original post.\n\nNTA\n\nYour parents mouth's wrote a check their asses couldn't cover.  They actually said they would watch your daughter even added the \"we will make it work\" implying that it was unconditional when it fact, it was very conditional.  They knew their schedule, they knew there were days and times that wouldn't be possible.  They should have been far more conditional in their offer, \"we feel for you, unfortunately we do have some obligations and we may not, let's speak again after we know the details\".\n\nYou're parents should not act like something is guaranteed when it's not.", "I\u2019m confused because they said they would make it work and then when I gave them the time they said no. I never ask them to watch our children anymore because I understand it is a big ask with the distance even though they have always told me distance isn\u2019t an issue. I know I can depend on my husbands family (and with us living in such a rural area there aren\u2019t a lot of other options) so I usually ask my in-laws but they will obviously be at the wake. So while in any other situation it wouldn\u2019t bother me, in this instance I\u2019m not asking them to watch our kid so my husband and I can catch a movie. I\u2019m asking them to watch our daughter because we both want to attend the wake of someone we love but our daughter is only 2 and can\u2019t sit still for 4 hours to come with us so their support in this situation would be very much appreciated.", "Yeah attending the wake of a cherished and well loved important family member in a respectful way (not dragging a toddler there) may not be an *emergency* but it is certainly important, the issue isn\u2019t that her parents won\u2019t babysit, it\u2019s that they told her they would make it work and babysit and then immediately went back on their word.", "Needing to go to a funeral kind of is.", "I visited them this past weekend and before we left they said if we needed anything to let them know so I mentioned once we know more details we might need them to watch our daughter during the wake so they said \u201cof course we will make it work\u201d so when I got home and texted them with a time they said they can\u2019t. So the switch up was confusing as well.", "Personally I wouldn\u2019t allow my mom to have a bond with my kid if she wasn\u2019t willing to babysit occasionally, if she\u2019s never going to help me out what use do I have for her.", "Your parents 'switching' is them avoiding conflict or discussion face-to-face with you and deferring it to when you aren't present.\n\nThey simply are not interested in doing it and figure it's easier to let you go home then decline.", "OP, you're NTA. If they said they'd watch her during the wake and then switched up on you, that makes them AHs. You can't just change your mind on something like that. It's not like you want them to babysit all the time, someone literally died. I'm sorry your parents aren't reliable.", "WOW! Talk about entitlement!", "There was a scheduling mix up, regarding a favor they wanted to do. When they learned the hours, it didn\u2019t work, because the father had work for 4 hours and the mother doesn\u2019t want to babysit alone.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t make her parents TA. Give me a break", "Someone died, they can change their schedules.", "No, he can\u2019t get time off work because his daughters\u2019 husbands\u2019 grandmother died.

It shows he prioritizes his unnecessary job over his daughter. \n\nThey said they'd make it work, but then switched up. Someone died, the least he can do is call in and watch his grandchild for the day.", "His daughters\u2019 husbands\u2019 grandmother died\u2026 He\u2019s a manager. Forgoing his work because his daughter is too entitled to consider any other childcare options is just asinine, and insisting otherwise is just AH behavior. \n\nIt\u2019s not his daughter. It\u2019s nobody to him that\u2019s died. He\u2019s not obliged at all to do this favor, and it\u2019s not reasonable to demand he shape his life around the daughter\u2019s childcare needs."]}
