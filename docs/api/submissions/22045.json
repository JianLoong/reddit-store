If he is comfortable enough to bring her to the ball game, then he should feel comfortable enough with you guys meeting. He is making it public he is dating her, and causing gossip. The worst part is, your son is uncomfortable with it. I would make it clear to your husband that in this situation there are no \u201cboundaries\u201d because he clearly did NOT communicate them, and explain why you went up to her. Also make it clear that your son is uncomfortable with her around, and state the exact words he said so husband cannot say \u201coh my ex made him say that blah blah blah\u201d or just have your son talk to the man! In situations like this, both sides need to be able to communicate and not pull stuff out of their ass like \u201cyou disrespected his boundaries!

Maybe he should listen to his own children so you don\u2019t have to get involved. \n\nYou conducted yourself with so much grace by going up and introducing yourself to her. You established dominance over the gossip situation and proved to your children that you\u2019re better than the gossip, and that you care about them and their needs. If your simple act makes your ex or his new gf uncomfortable, then they must understand how uncomfortable his own children must be by bringing her around nonstop so soon after your split.

So long you was polite and courteous  and your kids understand you was doing to stop the nonsense,  chalk it up as another day in divorce land.", "NTA. It seems that this woman is involved in your son and daughter's life's to a degree, so it's natural and healthy to acknowledge the situation and move on. Why introducing yourself to her is stepping a boundary, if doing politely and in good faith? On another hand, if your ex knows how boundaries work, he should be sure that he's not stepping your children's, by inserting his girlfriend to familiar settings where their children aren't comfortable with the company.", "My dad HATED that my mom and stepmom got along. Seeing the two of them laughing together got him so steamed his face would turn red.", "NTA.  I suspect your ex was hoping you\u2019d have a meltdown, but when you introduced yourself calmly he realized you were totally over him.  His ego couldn\u2019t handle it.  Good for you!", "NTA! I think what you did was great. It probably made the GF feel a bit more comfortable too. Your ex is just mad because you aren\u2019t jealous or chasing after him.

You don\u2019t have to be happy about it, but being civil is good. I think your ex is just jealous, she probably spent the car ride home saying how nice you were and a pleasure to meet you.

And here's why. While your kids May dislike her that's not really their choice. Who he sees as his business. He is under no obligation to introduce you to his new girlfriend. You wanted the divorce you decided to go up and introduce yourself. And I get the feeling that the manner in which you did so you really didn't convey in your post.

That's not how it works.\n\nCan you explain what you mean by this part? OP approached in a public place, as you said, so she's absolutely NTA, but had she done this by just showing up at his house unannounced, that would totally have been violating his boundaries.\n\nAnd as a sidenote, bringing his girlfriend to all the kids' games is stomping over their boundaries.\n\nI guess I just don't understand what you mean by your last sentence because basically all boundary violation occurs because of another person doing something to the boundary-haver.", "><<*she\u2019s an idiot if she wants to slow things done but then actively.*.>> I believe it is 14 yr old Daughter who wants Father/GF to slow things down", "I think you\u2019re projecting.", "Worth noting I have not said I think OP is TA. I just think there may be more to this. Separations/divorce times with kids can get messy & most friends only ever back up the friend and reinforce things they want to hear. \nLots of completely normal behaviours. \nFrom personal experience I 100% think they both should meet the respective new partners.

Not someone else, but yourself. \n\nTo be honest, it can be difficult to understand the nuances and it's a common misconception that boundaries can be imposed on others.
