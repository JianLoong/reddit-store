You introduced yourself to a person in the same vicinity as you, who was likely interacting with your children. Sounds perfectly reasonable to me.", "NTA introducing yourself to her in a public place is absolutely okay. You didn't speak poorly about him, you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nAnd you cannot violate his boundaries by doing something. That's not how it works.", "NTA - introducing yourself to someone associated with your children in a public setting, especially at one of your children's games, is perfectly appropriate.\n\nFrankly, and I may get slammed for this, I don't think it would be inappropriate to say that she was making the children uncomfortable by being there so early in the relationship.  Doesn't sound like you even went that far so you are not TA here.", "NTA, if he didn't want ypu to meet new gf, he shouldn't have broughed her to sons games.", "LOL.\nNTA.\nHis boundaries? Well, his attempt to use therapy language to control you is lame.\nAnd, you did the adult thing and the mature thing.\nHe\u2019s a raging idiot for thinking you two would never meet?\nAlthough she\u2019s an idiot if she wants to slow things done but then actively participates in these shenanigans.", "NTA He shouldn\u2019t have brought her to your children\u2019s games if he didn\u2019t want you to meet her.", "\u201cTell me you don\u2019t know boundaries work without telling me\u2026\u201d\n\nJeez \u2026 NTA so much.\n\nShe\u2019s around your kids. \nYou get to say hello.", "NTA. So he thought bringing her to his childs games and causing his children stress was okay for their boundaries but you being an adult and introducing yourself was over the line? He makes no sense. You did nothing wrong.", "You violated her boundaries by saying hello and introducing yourself?? NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou did the adult thing.  Your ex  is  acting immaturely.", "She sounds like the jealous tipe, but since you and your husband share custody of the kids, that means that you are bound to talk to each other frequently, so she better get used to it.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  What mostly likely happened is that your ex expected you to be, and act, jealous. But when you acted like a mature adult, it got under his skin.  Is the new gf much younger than you?", "NTA. If he is comfortable enough to bring her to the ball game, then he should feel comfortable enough with you guys meeting. He is making it public he is dating her, and causing gossip. The worst part is, your son is uncomfortable with it. I would make it clear to your husband that in this situation there are no \u201cboundaries\u201d because he clearly did NOT communicate them, and explain why you went up to her. Also make it clear that your son is uncomfortable with her around, and state the exact words he said so husband cannot say \u201coh my ex made him say that blah blah blah\u201d or just have your son talk to the man! In situations like this, both sides need to be able to communicate and not pull stuff out of their ass like \u201cyou disrespected his boundaries! (did not communicate boundaries)\u201d so your kids will be at peace. Its literally not about your relationship with him, or his relationship with her, or your relationship with your bf! Its all for the kids so you guys can have a happy healthy relationship even if youre broken up. Even if yall hate eachothers GUTS just pretend to like eachother for the kids till they reach 18 or so\u2026 then start planning ur revenge", "NTA\n\nHonestly you did the mature, responsible thing by introducing yourself, and frankly your husband should have introduced the two of you long before he introduced her to the kids. \n\nIt really sounds like he's just being petty.", "Hahaha NTA.\n\nHe can't bring her around and expect you to not interact with her. His choice to bring her around.", "My ex & I had a rule.  No one meets the kids until we know it's a serious relationship.  I think this is the best way to handle the breakup for the kids.  Anyway, NTA.  All you did was introduce yourself.  What boundaries does he have that you crossed?  NONE.  Ex is TA.", "Info: did he ever in the past indicate that you were not to be around his girlfriends?", "NTA\n\nWhat boundary have you violated? You don't owe anything to your ex beyond your kids. If you want to have a respectful convo with his gf, it is up to you and the gf, not to him.", "NTA. But you know that by now.", "NTA. *You* violated *his* boundaries? Maybe he should listen to his own children so you don\u2019t have to get involved. \n\nYou conducted yourself with so much grace by going up and introducing yourself to her. You established dominance over the gossip situation and proved to your children that you\u2019re better than the gossip, and that you care about them and their needs. If your simple act makes your ex or his new gf uncomfortable, then they must understand how uncomfortable his own children must be by bringing her around nonstop so soon after your split. If they can\u2019t handle playing like adults, clearly this relationship of theirs is too new to be doing \u201cfamily\u201d things together like *attending his children\u2019s sporting events?*\n\nYou did the right thing, and stuck up for your children in the process. Shame on your ex for not respecting the boundaries *of his own children.*", "NTA. Ex sounds incredibly controlling.", "NTA.  Even if you were jealous, that was the mature thing to do. \n\nHe's just pissed because he probably thought you were eaten up with jealousy, and that's why the kids are so distressed. Now, he knows you're not..", "NTA.  It's usual and customary for somebody to introduce themselves.  If you hadn't, he probably would have accused you of being rude and trying to turn your kids against her.  I doubt there was any winning for you in this scenario.", "NTA. If he's going to be bringing her around your children, it's perfectly reasonable for the two of you to be acquainted. If he wants to set a boundary about you having contact with her, he shouldn't be bringing her around the kids.", "NTA introducing yourself, when she is attending an event involving your children. She is there in a quasi-parental role - you (and your ex) are there as parents. \n\nIf she wants to present herself as your ex\u2019s next partner, and this your children\u2019s to-be-step parent, then you SHOULD get to know her.", "NTA introducing yourself, when she is attending an event involving your children.

He\u2019s probably upset that you weren\u2019t too intimidated to introduce yourself.", "NTA *but* that's only if truly you made no attempt to meddle in their relationship or really discuss anything private between you two.

I know I am more attractive and look great for 50, but it was funny the other moms said that.", "No.  In fact, he made a huge deal out of ME bringing a guy around my kids!  I just introduced my kids to BF of 6 months yesterday at my 50th bday party. I got their express permission before doing it too.", "Nope, just said hello, nice to meet you and carried on. Zero agenda, but would agree if I was meddling, I would be the AH.", "Oooh gotcha, my bad. Still though, he brought her around the kid's ball games and never expected them to talk? Plus OP was just doing it to clear up any confusion or gossip and there was no nasty intent behind it. I stick with NTA", "Sounds like he wants to make you jealous & is butthurt that you moved on. NTA OP.", "LOL - then your ex was probably just paranoid about what you'd tell her. Perhaps with good reason.", "For sure. This is some weird Jonah Hill shit to freak over for him. \nHe clearly makes poor decisions.", "Nta if he is bringing her around then she must know you exist.", "tell the Ex he violated his daughter's boundaries by moving too fast.\n\nyou two have kids together and if he is going to being GF to the kids events, where you are likely to be, why shouldn't you introduce yourself?\n\nNTA.

A boundary is something you draw around yourself, not someone else. Thats a fence.", "NTA\n\nDecent display of mature behaviour. It\u2019s not your issue if it makes him uncomfortable and actually that\u2019s a bonus and incentive enough to keep doing it.", "NTA. You have a right to know who your child will be around when you aren't.", "I'm sorry but I would want to meet a new love interest before my ex introduced them to my kids, or at least be there at the time. Idk if that's weird or not, but I would offer the same courtesy to the ex. Of course I would trust the ex to have a good head on their shoulders, but I wouldn't want someone who is a stranger to me interacting with my kids. Idk if that's weird or unacceptable.\n\nTotally NTA. I mean, bringing their new love interest to *your* child's/children's games or activities seems like fair grounds for introductions.", "NTA\nYour ex should have introduced you when he started bringing her around.", "Let me get this right\u2026.his boundary is that you never speak to his gf despite you having kids and him bringing her to their events \ud83e\udd23 your ex needs to grow up, luckily that\u2019s not your problem.

He sounds like he's throwing a tantrum because you haven't thrown a tantrum, and acted like an adult. \n\nOnly speculating here - but I wonder if he has sat and bad mouthed you to high heavens to the new GF, so when you have approached her with decency it's made everything he has said look like the shit it is. Lol.", "NTA, you and your ex share kids.  It was wrong for him to bring her to events of the kids and not introduce you.  I wonder what he has told her about you.  What lies have been told that she will find out about.", "NTA - this person is a new addition to your children\u2019s life. of cause you introduced yourself. Your their mom, you get to know the important people in their life.", "NTA, boundaries like this need to be established before hand.  \nIn this case, he's either afraid you will get along, or that you will bad mouth him.  \nBut its a bit rich that he gets upset at you for violating an unknown boundary, while he openly ignores his kids boundaries.", "Ha! I\u2019m guessing he didn\u2019t expect you to be cordial. Sounds like he\u2019s trying to create drama and conflict amongst you and your kids. NTA.", "NTA. Sounds like what a mature adult would do. Your ex is just trying to start drama", "NTA, I did the same. I asked for the divorce, idc about his relationship so will slap on the charm anytime I'm around her. \n\nHe's an idiot and so is she. It's best for the kids if you're all cordial. Violated his boundaries by speaking to a woman your kids are around, in a public place. No wonder you're divorcing him.", "NTA it seems your the only adult in this situation", "It seems like a perfectly reasonable and non-hostile thing to do. Very adult! NTA, he is being silly.", "NTA- boundaries are personal rules for yourself. He can be mad all he wants but why is he bringing her to the kids events if he doesn't want her around you?", "What is up with everybody saying you violated my boundary when what they really mean is I don't want you to do that? He doesn't get to make a boundary that you can't go and talk to a totally different person. That is not a boundary that is controlling. NTA", "NTA. He does not respect his own daughter's boundaries. No, you did nothing wrong. You acted like a normal adult. Not sure what his problem is.", "NTA.", "NTA", "You violated his boundaries by introducing yourself to someone he was bringing around your children? Lol dude can kick rocks. NTA", "NTA and as someone who works closely with families negotiating their way through separations, I am really impressed with your maturity. If more parents could be like you, it would save so much damage to children. Parents breaking up is never easy but seeing the adults handle it maturely and respectfully is important. They will model their future relationships based on how they see their parents behave. \n\nAdditionally, if this person is going to be spending time around your children, it's important that you know each other. First, to know who your kids are spending time with and second, should their be an emergency regarding the children, you want her to be comfortable contacting you.", "If you stalked her and followed her to his house, you\u2019re violating his boundaries.

Your ex is acting immaturely.", ">And you cannot violate his boundaries \n\nHis boundary seems to be extremely weird/stupid, if he believes two grown adults may never see or introduce each other, considering one has birthed his kids and other one he takes around to events of the said kids.\n\nNTA, OP.", "Yep, and that would be my response. Don't want us communicating, stop bringing her around", "I think he was pissed that ex-wife is so clearly over him.

Totally screams JEALOUS \ud83d\ude12", "Probably.\nHe likely wanted to get a rise out of her and was angry it didn\u2019t happen.\nIf I were the new GF, this would be such a red flag.\nLike, bring me around but don\u2019t introduce me? Ew.", "My thoughts exactly. The fact that the call didn\u2019t happen right away probably means the new gf and him got into a fight and she brought it up/called him out on a lie.", "Great that you have a supportive group of friends.", "Hang on, it\u2019s ok for his gf to be around the children but not your bf?? Double standards much? He had it all planned in his head how it would play out and you pissed all over his Rice Krispies by being a reasonable human being. How very dare you! Lol NTA", "NTA\n\nYou can\u2019t just claim anything is a \u201cboundary\u201d when you don\u2019t communicate it and it\u2019s not obvious. Plenty of friendships form in these situations. \n\nI think this is more about him being afraid you two will swap notes and make his playboy life more difficult.", "You are being a great mom.  You let your kids make the choice of meeting him or not.", "None of those things exclude jealousy. \nOne can still be jealous even though they shouldn\u2019t be when seeing their ex has moved on quickly. \nI\u2019m not saying she shouldn\u2019t be jealous, should be jealous or that it\u2019s a bad thing. \nI also don\u2019t think introducing was a bad thing. She should get to meet the person that\u2019s around her children.", "This is it! Since OP asked for the divorce, he's jealous of her new BF! \n\nWhy wait so long to tell her she crossed a line? It's clearly because of this event!"]}
