Mine and my dads relationship has always been somewhat strained with us having minimal contact over the past 2 years. When I was a new born my parents split up following my father being arrested. He spent the first few years of my life in and out of prison, mostly for drug related offences. He was previously addicted to a class A drug. Once I was older (about 11 years old), after he was clean for a few years, he moved 1.5hrs from where we lived (10min apart) to be with his new wife. During this time he started acting erratically and I suspected he was back on drugs. At the time I asked for a drug test which was negative however I found out a couple of years ago that he had relapsed and used his wife at the times urine to do the test. When I was about 16 my dad found himself in a new relationship which ended in me having a new brothers unfortunately he was taken into foster care (other reasons) and ultimately my dad ended up alone. At this time I again noticed this erratic behaviour and some suspicious action (I didn\u2019t know about the previous fake test at this point). I again began to question things but didn\u2019t have a big relationship with him so didn\u2019t feel it was my place mention it as I was old enough to distance myself. Well my parents got back together (story for another time) and shortly after I went to minimal contact with my father due to him being manipulative and verbally abusive towards me. Over the past year information has come about and my father has started abusing class A drugs again, with a video of him being sent to my about 1 month ago. He was so bad to the point my younger brother (17M) had to stay at a friends as it wasn\u2019t safe for him to go home. According to my mother this was a wake up call for my dad and he\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d now. However, knowing how much he\u2019s hid it and masked in the past it\u2019s hard for me to believe him. With the baby on the way I\u2019m just worried about him being around the child in a state and me not necessarily being able to tell or having to confront him. So would I be the asshole for asking my dad for a negative drug test before I allow him around the baby?", "created_utc": 1674824312, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mk6tg/wibtah_for_requesting_my_dad_have_a_negative_drug/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He has faked a drug test before\n2. Just a month ago, you got a video showing he was abusing drugs again\n3. He is manipulative and verbally abusive to you\n\nANY of these reasons would be enough to say - No, I would prefer he not visit.\n\nYour baby can't speak up or make decisions. You are his/her advocate. It's not about making your father feel included or your mother feel your dad is OK and her decision to get back with him the right one.\n\nIt IS about the baby being safe and YOU feeling comfortable and safe yourself. I would say not to even think about letting him visit unless he has a good 6 months or a year of being clean.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2018s very generous that you\u2018re willing to let him meet your baby at all. He either accepts it and respects your reasonable wishes or leaves you alone.", "NTA for asking for the drug test. Really that\u2019s the bare minimum you should be doing. \n\nAlthough possibly you\u2019re an AH for allowing someone with a known history of abuse and addiction to form a relationship with your child without clear evidence that they\u2019ve changed. My grandfather was an alcoholic and my mother didn\u2019t let him near me until I was four years old and she was sure he\u2019d been sober for years; don\u2019t let someone inconstant or disappointing into an impressionable child\u2019s life without taking every possible step to protect their vulnerable emotions.", "NTA & if he's changed, he will understand why you're asking.", "NTA.  Frankly if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t want him in my life at all, much less around my child, whether he\u2019s clean or not.  You say he\u2019s been verbally abusive to you, lost custody of another child, and your teenage brother didn\u2019t feel safe in his home quite recently.  This is not a safe person to have around a baby.  If you do decide to let him see the baby, please please never let him be around the baby when you aren\u2019t there.", "NTA, even if he's your father he seems like a really toxic person to have around. I think knowing his past action the drug test seems logical and almost needed. Protecting your future child is more important than bruising your father ego.\n\nIn my opinion I don't think he deserves to see your child at all but it's  your choice\n\nEdit: added last sentence", "NTA \n\nTo be honest, I don't think it's a good idea for him to meet the baby or have a relationship with the baby. He is too unstable and if he is abusive, there even more reason to keep him away. I know you're young and it's hard to make decisions like this, but now you will be responsible for a tiny human. Protect your baby.", "NTA if it were me I wouldn't even consider being in a relationship with someone like him. Especially my dad. He's seems manipulative. This is your baby so it's your rules. I think it's fair that you want him to do a drug test. He should not be around a baby while using or coming down or waiting for his next dose. You are in charge of who gets to be around your child so you get to make the rules. But remember that he'll likely always be a user. If he hasn't gotten clean yet he probably won't ever try. There are a ton of addicts who turn their lives around and stop using but he doesn't seem like he's one of those. If you keep in contact, buy a bunch of those home drug tests and make him do one every time he goes to see the baby.", "NTA and if I were in your shoes meeting my baby would not even be on the table at this point", "Hi, \nJust some clarifications on a few points. The reason I have kept minimal contact with my dad is because that\u2019s the only way I can have any relationship with 3/4 of my younger brothers. And no there\u2019s no way for me to have direct contact because of issues with their mothers. Also my brother was taken away because of his mothers actions not my fathers (more to it and obvs my dad wasn\u2019t completely innocent). Additionally, he has had periods where he was clean and that\u2019s why I would give him the opportunity to change, addiction is a battle and sometimes people relapse. Also I wouldn\u2019t be leaving the baby alone with my dad at all this is a case of if my mum is coming to visit would I allow my father to as well. Lastly, I live in the uk and unfortunately there\u2019s nothing regimented in place but ofc if I had doubts at the time I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to not allow him around my child. Hope that offers some insite. Also I just want to say thank you to everyone for your comments I feel so validated rn honestly when I\u2019ve asked friends that know about my past with my dad they\u2019ve said I\u2019m over reacting and would be asking too much.", "NTA - your child, your rules. Period.", "NTA but you have to understand it is your responsibility to protect that baby and if you do not believe your father is sober then you know he shouldn't be around the baby. Sometimes being a parent means being the asshole for the good of your child.", "NTA.  In fact, I bet the law in your state requires that you keep baby away from all drug addicts whilst they are intoxicated.  \n\nBut you already know drug testing isn't foolproof.  If you consider only what is best for baby, how baby can be safest, then what need is there to allow your dad to see baby at all?\n\nIf you consider allowing your dad to see your baby only because you don't want your dad to hassle you, then you are not putting baby's well-being and survival first.  Your dad has nobody but himself to blame for losing access to his newborn grandchild.", "Def not the asshole. You should also demand that he seeks some sort of help before asking for a drug test. Make it a requirement to show that he is genuinely trying to get better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wouldn't let him be around me OR my kid at all unless he went to full on rehab and support groups. Not sorry. Prove to me you're really ready to help yourself and be clean or be a mess away from me.\n\n I'm all for reaching out and helping someone who is ready to be helped; but i also know they need to be READY.  You can't help someone who doesn't want to help themselves. And if they are truly ready to help themselves, they will do whatever it takes to prove they've changed.", "What's the purpose of the drug test? Seems a bit pointless. \n\nYou know your dads a drug addict so it would be sensible to never leave your kid alone with him. \nYou then have 2 choices: 1. Allowing contact with your dad knowing he could be using at any time. Whether or not he tells you his clean or 2. Going no contact between your kid and your dad. \n\nI reckon slight YTA for requesting a drug test because your just making it really clear you don't trust him and you can make that decision without a test result. Hi behaviour will tell you whether it's safe for contact.", "NTA. You and your baby come first and if he's had a history of lying and hiding things before, what makes you believe that he's not going to try lying again? You're allowed to ask for things that will ensure your safety, especially with a new baby. I wouldn't want someone like him in my life around my family.", "NTA\n\nAsk for a drug test everytime he meets the baby. And it could even be an incentive to keep away from the drugs. One positive test and no meetings with his grandchild forever.", "NTA. You still wouldn't be the arsehole if you outright refused to allow him to have any contact with your child.\n\nYour father has no rights to see you or your child, and you have a responsibility to protect your child.\n\nIf you would like to have your father back in your and your babies life, then rather than a urine sample, you should ask for a hair follicle test. The sample will be collected by the tester directly from his head and it will show whether he has used drugs in the last three months. It is a much better indicator as to whether he is actually clean or whether he just abstained long enough to pass the urine test. It can be repeated every every three months to show a consistent history of (lack of) drug use.", "Hey OP? \n\nDon't let him meet your kid. Period. You cannot trust him to not fake a drug test. If you want your kid to know their grandfather, you need to screen the man yourself and decide if that's safe. From what you've said in the post, I don't think it is. \n\nA drug test is a good start, but I don't think it's enough. NTA, though.", "NTA, but you would be foolish to assume a clean result would prove anything, as he's already used other people's urine to pass a drug test.", "NTA. You have a reason to distrust him so your ask isn\u2019t out of the question. Maybe he has changed and if so I think it\u2019s good he wants some semblance of family as torn as it is.if he\u2019s truly changed this could be a good thing. However, he hasn\u2019t given you any reason to trust him and trust must be earned so you\u2019re smart to tread cautiously.", "Info: why does he need to be sober to be around your baby?  are you afraid he\u2019s going to harm the baby? Is he known for being violent while on drugs?", "I wouldn\u2019t allow him close. And you already know he would cheat one way or another.", "NTA and you also would be NTA if you didn't let him in your life or around your baby at all. Keep yourself and your child safe.", "NTA, but if you know he fakes drug tests why would a negative one satisfy you?", "100% NTA \nYou are your baby's only voice, thier protection.  You do what is best for your baby. It's not about you, dad, or anyone else at this point.", "ESH.\n\nI think a reasonable request is that if he wants to see the kid, he's not on any drugs and doesn't display any signs of being on any drugs for the visit.  What he does in the time away from your child, really isn't any of your business.\n\nAnd your dad for not ever learning. He's destroying familial relationships with his decisions and that makes him an AH too.", "Exactly. Even if he were to give a negative test right this moment, the history of his behavior & use is more than enough to refuse contact.", "This is the best answer.", "NTA. You\u2019re looking out for the most important person in your world. You\u2019re coming at this from a very mature and respectable angle, and obviously still care about your father. My mom was with an addict who was physically abusive when my son was born, he was never allowed around my son, and my mom eventually left him and found someone much better. I would do the same thing in your shoes. Respect for you acknowledging addiction isn\u2019t easy to beat. You\u2019re showing compassion for someone who violated your trust.", "NTA, but I wouldn't trust a negative test from this person. I'd rather go NC.", "NTA. But I  do question the judgement of your mother. Your father has a long history of drug abuse and relapses. Only 1 month ago, he was using again and was so bad your brother was not safe at home. Despite this, your mother still wants to stay with him. She would rather be with your father than protect her son. Your mother is an enabler. Personally, I would not allow either of them to visit. Not at least you have solid proof that your father is actively in recovery for a period of time.", "NTA and if he fights it it\u2019s because he\u2019s not clean.", "Your responsibility is to protect your baby.", "NTA: why let him near your baby at all?", "No, but as you now know, drug tests can be beaten, and your dad has proven capable and willing to do so. \n\nIf I were you, I'd change your visitation criteria to your father demonstrating a change in his patterns of behavior. This isn't a quick solution but IMO it's the only one that protects your child. And you absolutely would be NTA for being cautious about his access to your baby based on his history and recent past. His \"wake up call\" was less than a year old. That's not enough time given how long his history with substance abuse and behavior issues is, for someone to say with confidence that he has fully changed.", "NTA. You are better off going LC or NC. Don't let your parents into your baby's life. And report them if the situation at their home is unsafe for your brother.", "There is no point asking for the drug test unless you find a way for him to do it where he can't fake it. You'd need someone in the room with him while he peed into the cup and then have the cup immediately taken away from him to be tested once finished.\n\nBecause he's faked this before, he'll easily do it again.\n\nNTA", "NTA for asking for a test. But, honestly, with the history you've given us, I really don't think it's a good idea to have him in your baby's life *at all*. There is absolutely no way for you to trust any negative test results he gives, since he's falsified tests before. And he could **REALLY** hurt your baby if he *does* falsify a drug test. Even if you never leave him in the room alone with the baby, you are still literally putting your baby's life in his hands. \n\nHonestly, I'm leaning towards YWBTAH if you let him into your kid's life, period.", "Yep, I agree with these reasons completely. NTA, and this would be a hard pass for me with my son. I don't have anyone around him that I can't totally trust. \n\nYour dad has exhibited behavior that is beyond concerning. It's dangerous.", "Also, if he meets the baby with family court wanting to maintain existing relationships then it might give him a toehold for grandparents rights.", "Why ask for a test when you know for a fact he has faked the test in the past?\n\nIf I was you I wouldnt allow him to meet the child until YOU have a relationship and know for yourself that he\u2019s drug free. \n\nSo NTA for the question you asked, but you\u2019re asking the wrong question.", "You will have to ask for one each and every time he is around your child from the story you tell.  He is not trustworthy at all.  Your Mom can't vouch for him as she's already making excuses or explanations on his behalf (\"He's \"clean\" now\").   She is not impartial.", "NTA\n\nBut just cut off people that need to be drug tested in order for you to feel comfortable having them around your kid. That\u2019s just inviting a major stressor into your child\u2019s life. \n\nI hear nothing about narcotics anonymous here. So he\u2019s \u201cclean\u201d for bouts of time then goes back to use. So maybe just remove yourself from the situation. That is always a valid choice.", "NTA but how can you be sure he isn\u2019t going to fake the test again? If I were you I wouldn\u2019t want this man around my baby at all.", "INFO: Why are you considering letting him around your baby at all?

Keep him away from you and yours, same for your mother, if she tries to bring him in under any pretence.\n\nNta", "NTA for the drug test.\n\nBut honestly, it sounds like you would be the AH for letting your dad around your baby at all. He has shown time and time again he is using and not trustworthy. Why would you want to keep giving him chances?", "NTA. Your father has manipulated you in the past, and to be honest, I don't know if I would want him to see the baby at all. Asking for a drug test, even though he has faked one in the past is reason enough for you to deny his toxic influence on your child. If you need to plead with your father to take a drug test, don't allow him near your kid. I also wouldn't allow his wife anywhere near your baby either, considering she is not only ignoring, but encouraging your fathers dangerous, toxic lifestyle. So no, you're not the asshole for looking after the safety and innocence of your newborn. Also, congrats on being a mother :).", "NTA. But why would you want him to meet your child at all? So he could hurt them too? My father is an alcoholic AH I cut all contacts with years ago, I would never let him anywhere near my child.", "YTA for wanting that guy around your kid at all.", "A year, definitely. Not just no drugs, but a year of responsible behavior.", "I assume they're hoping that if he really is clean, a lot of the negative behavior was drug related and of he isn't an asshole off drugs they would want a relationship.", "This. If he gets angry or defensive it is because he shouldn\u2019t be around the baby.", "Hopefully she goes for a blood test", "Yes! OP (u/Dry-Doughnut-9385) please take note of this!"]}
