We had video chatted/emailed prior to me moving, and they were aware I have a cat. \n\nAfter I had moved in, my roommate (F 40) requested that I have my cat tested for anything her cat could possibly contract. I set up a vet appointment and got her tested/made sure she was up to date on her vaccines. \n\nI also notified my roommate that my ex-partner and I are doing 'shared-custody' of this cat because we got her together. Every two to three months, she would move houses. Upon hearing about this, my roommate told me that \"shared custody might not work because disruptions upset her cat\" and that she \"would be moving out by the end of the lease (1 yr) and I could bring her back after that.\" \n\nI've been keeping my cat in my room since that conversation. I have classes Mon-Thurs but I am home a decent amount of the time to play with her/provide her with company. I am also getting an automatic feeder (she has scratchposts/toys already) and leash training her to make sure she has a good quality of life for the portion of time she spends at my place. \n\nThe vet told me that she's up to date on her vaccines/she's negative for \"feline triple\" -- but she does have feline herpes. The vet (and an extensive google search) told me that it was very common (97% of cats have come into contact with the virus, the majority of cats have it) and that I can give her l-lysine supplements to reduce flare-ups. I also told her that I talked with my ex-partner and we want to move forward with the shared custody idea. I told this to my roommate, and said that if she wanted to get her cat tested/talk to her vet, they could possibly meet, BUT it was up to her (since she has lived there longer) and if she didn't want our cats to meet, I would keep my cat in my room. I also offered to extend some of the time that my cats spends at my ex-partners place. \n\nMy roommates replied and (at first) said she \"didn't think it was agreeable\" for me to have my cat in my room because she sometimes \"meows when I am not there\" and asked me if I was willing to pay for her vet visit and testing costs. I said I didn't think this was fair because we should both be responsible for getting out cats tested, but I offered to split the bill if it would be a financial burden to her. She responded kind of passive-aggressively and said she would do it, and then said \"if my vet says that having both cats in the same apartment (on either side of a closed door) is still a risk to \\[my cats\\] health please relocate her.\" She also now said that \"if my vet tells me she won't be a risk to \\[her cats\\] if kept in your room, then you may plan to do that.\" \n\nAITA for not planning to relocate my cat?

If they had so many conditions tied to having your cat move in with you they should have told you prior to moving in. Dumping all of this stuff on you after you moved in and expecting you to just get rid of your cat is crazy.", "NTA, that rommay is too demanding. She had you pay for your cat's test on her demand but doesn't have her cat tested? What's the point then? Your cat may catch smth from hers then.", "NTA\n\nYour roommate is just annoying.", "NTA\u2014 this roommate sounds like a real pill. Why did she agree to you coming with a cat in the first place? And the cat can\u2019t leave because that disrupts her cat!? That\u2019s bonkers.", "YTA \u2014 it\u2019s a cat not a kid. Sharing custody is horrible for a cat and they need consistency. You are doing what you want for you and your ex and don\u2019t really care what\u2019s best for the cat. That\u2019s pretty selfish.", "NTA. This roommate is not reasonable.

Making your cat bounce back and forth, plus being locked in your room while with you, is not a great situation for it in all likelihood.\n\nAnd even if feline herpes is common, it is still a disease with negative effects that isn't unreasonable for someone to want to stop their pet from getting. IF someone with a cold sore drank out of your cup would you be okay with \"It isn't a big deal and it is really common, you can just buy and take medication to reduce flare ups\"?", "NTA for refusing to get rid of your cat. \n\nHowever, the shared custody with your ex is a very bad idea. Cats do not deal well with having their routines disrupted. It can lead to neurotic behaviors like excessive grooming (to the point of giving themselves bald spots and scabs), trouble eating and/or digesting food, not using the litterbox, separation anxiety. And that's just the stuff I know about. \n\nYou and your ex have to come to an agreement about who gets the cat permanently. I know that will be difficult, but the two of you need to make the cat's well-being the priority, not your own desires to share custody of a pet you foolishly adopted together. Why was it foolish? You didn't even think about what a split could do to an animal that depended on both of you. Do better.", "NTA. Feline herpes *is* very common, and pretty easily manageable with lysine, so you are doing your due diligence. Additionally, unless you have an extremely immunocompromised cat or a short faced breed such as a Persian, symptoms are usually minimal and manifest as occasional nasal or ocular discharge +\\- some sneezing. Not saying she should be \u201cjust fine\u201d with her cat contracting it, but that\u2019s what the lysine is for\u2014 to help reduce viral shedding and prevent it being spread to another cat. \n\nI have had two different cats at different points in my life that had herpes, and my other cats never contracted it\u2014 at least they never had any symptoms of it if they did. \n\nFIV/FeLV are the two big ones you need to worry about and your cat was negative for both, so you should be in the clear. \n\nCats are much more adaptable than most people give them credit for; going back and forth between two households will likely not impact her cat at all. Having to keep your cat cooped up in your bedroom is unfair to yours, and if she\u2019s an animal lover you\u2019d hopefully think she\u2019s be sympathetic to that. \n\nThere is no need for you to be financially responsible for \u201cfuture vet visits and tests\u201d because you\u2019ve screened your cat for the necessary illnesses and I assume it\u2019s also vaccinated for the appropriate diseases.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is BS because NONE of the cats I've cared for have it. What websites did you look at for your \"extensive Google search\"?
