Is there anyone in the family you could talk to about her behavior and whether she needs help? If she already bought the wheelchair, could you return it for cash or donate it to charity?", "WTAF. Accessibility aids are not toys and this is just weird. Is grandma suggesting that your kid cosplay disabilities? Or fake a faith healing?\n\nDefinitely NTA. I'd be careful with some of the other suggestions to accept and donate the devices, because opening the door to \"God told me your child needs to do X\" is going to get very messy if it hasn't already. Your instincts are good. Listen to them.", "NTA. This is seriously unhinged behaviour. Is this usual or new behaviour? If it's the latter I'd be worried about the grandmother having an UTI or the first signs of dementia.", "NTA. Wheelchairs aren't toys. That his grandmother doesn't see that is weird. Don't let her give him one. Regardless of whether he has been praying for it or not, some time or other we all have to learn that we don't get everything we pray for, and that is ultimately a very good thing. People can get to need a wheelchair for real in just a blink of an eye, and God forbid it ever happens to your son.", "NTA\n\nIt's important to prioritize sensitivity and avoid using mobility aids as toys, especially considering the recent situation with your family friend.", "NTA-just accept the chair and donate it to someone in need! Why pick a fight with a crazy woman?", "NTA.  Why do so many religious people think their beliefs are more important than anyone else's feelings?", "NTA - this is unhinged behavior. A wheelchair is not a toy. wtf is wrong with her honestly? Does she need to be institutionalized or on meds?", "Nta. Gramma seems out of touch with reality\u2026", "NTA.

What\u2019s next, a prosthetic leg?", "INFO \n\nWhy would she get your son a wheelchair? You say he doesn't need one, but is that you saying he doesn't when he actually could benefit from it? It's just an odd \"gift\" to get someone out of the blue if he's not disabled. Is this a case of her getting an unnecessary gift, or you not seeing a need?", "Wait, what?  I\u2019m baffled here. I don\u2019t in any way want to disrespect her faith, but why would she believe an able bodied child would wish for a piece of medical equipment he doesn\u2019t need? Is it meant to be a toy in her mind?  Has your child ever expressed a wish for a wheelchair?  I can\u2019t begin to think how I\u2019d handle this situation but certainly wish you luck.

He saw one on a TV show and said it would be fun to ride around in", "After talking to her, (we just had the Christmas meet up) she said that he said they looked cool at some point while watching a show. She then commented that she knows him well enough for her to know that my son has been praying for one and she wants to fulfill his prayers", "I think giving your son a wheelchair would be a really bad idea! Kids need to learn that special aids of any kind are not for you to mess with. it is equipment that some people need to function/help make life easier for them. Getting your son a wheelchair as a toy means there's a risk he'll think it's appropriate to use someone else's wheelchair as a toy because no matter how much you try to guide your kids in the right direction  you can never know what they will do and saying \"you can play with this wheelchair but not any other ones\" is imo just making things confusing for him for no reason. \n\nIf your MiL does end up buying it anyway I'd show it to your son, explain why some people need to use it and then say. \"But since your legs are healthy we're going to hive this wheelchair to another kid your age who actually need it\"", "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. There's so many unanswered questions here. MIL seems to be suffering from... something...does everyone involved here know your family isn't religious? That's just a bizarre thing to fixate on.", "That\u2019s a difficult situation. I suppose let her do what she believes in and then explain to your son why you did?  That it\u2019s often the right choice to be kind and accept a gift rather than argue with grandma, who feels strongly about this, but that wheelchairs aren\u2019t toys and why some people need them?  It could be a chance to teach your child compassion for both his grandma and differently ambled people. Just my thoughts.", "A UTI? I\u2019ve had several of those and they never caused me to behave in new and strange ways\n\nEdit: TIL that UTIs make older people crazy", "They do, they don't really approve and just operate on the basis of their faith. I have no problem with that but not when it effects my children in an unhealthy way.", "UTIs are sneaky and can develop quickly. In older folks, it can make them say or do very strange things (even if they were already \u201cquirky\u201d to begin with). A friend\u2019s mil developed one just before thanksgiving that led to her saying some extremely mean/hurtful/ourlandish things before she eventually developed some other health issues on thanksgiving day that led to them testing for the uti.

About time she went to a real psychologist because that's way far from baseline.", "You should look it up. It can cause odd behavior, delirium and a host of other problems especially in the elderly.", "In older adults, UTIs often present as delirium, agitation, aggression or other unusual behavioral changes. It's pretty different than in young, healthy people.", "I am willing to bet OCD, she used to wash the ceiling and walls with bleach and used a mix of pinesaw and toothpaste for brushing her teeth because she didn't feel things were clean enough even though she would clean for hours", "That is very weird, I\u2019ve never heard that before.
