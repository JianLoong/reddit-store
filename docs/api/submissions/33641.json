Is there anyone in the family you could talk to about her behavior and whether she needs help? If she already bought the wheelchair, could you return it for cash or donate it to charity?", "WTAF. Accessibility aids are not toys and this is just weird. Is grandma suggesting that your kid cosplay disabilities? Or fake a faith healing?\n\nDefinitely NTA. I'd be careful with some of the other suggestions to accept and donate the devices, because opening the door to \"God told me your child needs to do X\" is going to get very messy if it hasn't already. Your instincts are good. Listen to them.", "NTA. This is seriously unhinged behaviour. Is this usual or new behaviour? If it's the latter I'd be worried about the grandmother having an UTI or the first signs of dementia.", "NTA. Wheelchairs aren't toys. That his grandmother doesn't see that is weird. Don't let her give him one. Regardless of whether he has been praying for it or not, some time or other we all have to learn that we don't get everything we pray for, and that is ultimately a very good thing. People can get to need a wheelchair for real in just a blink of an eye, and God forbid it ever happens to your son.", "NTA\n\nIt's important to prioritize sensitivity and avoid using mobility aids as toys, especially considering the recent situation with your family friend.", "NTA-just accept the chair and donate it to someone in need! Why pick a fight with a crazy woman?", "NTA.  Why do so many religious people think their beliefs are more important than anyone else's feelings?", "NTA - this is unhinged behavior. A wheelchair is not a toy. wtf is wrong with her honestly? Does she need to be institutionalized or on meds?", "Nta. Gramma seems out of touch with reality\u2026", "NTA. Do not accept the wheelchair and then donate it - wheelchairs are important technical equipment and generally can't just be transferred by donation.", "NTA \nThis is so weird I love it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What\u2019s next, a prosthetic leg?", "INFO \n\nWhy would she get your son a wheelchair? You say he doesn't need one, but is that you saying he doesn't when he actually could benefit from it? It's just an odd \"gift\" to get someone out of the blue if he's not disabled. Is this a case of her getting an unnecessary gift, or you not seeing a need?", "Wait, what?  I\u2019m baffled here. I don\u2019t in any way want to disrespect her faith, but why would she believe an able bodied child would wish for a piece of medical equipment he doesn\u2019t need? Is it meant to be a toy in her mind?  Has your child ever expressed a wish for a wheelchair?  I can\u2019t begin to think how I\u2019d handle this situation but certainly wish you luck.
