I have a little sister (10F) who really looks up to me, and lately has been wanting to spend more time with me. Which is fine, she's an awesome kid, so I try to make time when I can.\n\nAnyway my wife was in the hospital for a few days last month because her appendix decided to shit the bed, she's fine but it was scary for a bit. My sister really likes my wife as well, and had asked if she could come to visit her with me. I explained that no, they only allowed one visitor and it had to be immediate family only. \n\nShe asked why she wasnmt considered such, since they're sisters (in-law, but she doesn't call her that) I explained that once we got married, our old immediate family became our extended family, like our cousins. Our only immediate family is eachother, and any children we eventually have.\n\nThat really upset her, and she started asking if I really only saw her like a cousin now. I said no, but she is my priority now, not her or our parents. Now she's not talking to me, and our parents think I could've handled it better. I really don't think that's true, but I could be wrong.\n\n\nUpdate: So yeah I fucked up, I see that now. I feel like shit and deserve to, because that was such a hurtful thing to say to her. Even worse is that I was stubborn enough not to apologize for her sake. She's still not speaking to me, so I wrote a note to deliver to my parents for her (I owe them an apology too).\n\n\"(Sister), I'm so sorry that I said what I said to you, I was wrong and you are right to be as angry as you are. You're still my sister and no matter what happens that won't change, and I'm sorry that I let you think otherwise.

I think you're mistaking the concept of what immediate family is. Genetically and legally, they're all your immediate family.

Immediate family is anyone you are related to and there is no person in between you. There is no one between you and your parents, so they are immediate family. No one between you and your siblings, no one between you and your children so all are immediate family. The exception is your spouse / partner who is made your immediate family by law / common-law. Your niblings are not 'immediate family' because your siblings stand between you and them. They are an 'extension' of your siblings so are therefore your 'extended' family. Your aunts and uncles are 'extensions' of your parents so are therefore your 'extended' family.\n\n\nYour little sister is and *always will be* your immediate family, no matter how many times either of you marries or how many kids either of you has. Your immediate connection to each other cannot be changed, ever. The only 'immediate family' connection that can be changed is to one's spouse due to divorce.

Priority changes due to situations and circumstances. For example, if your sister were in the hospital battling for her life and wanted to see you, you aren't going to say \"No, sorry, my wife wants to Netflix and chill tonight and she's always my number one priority\", are you? People take the idea of your spouse or children being your priority a little too far in my opinion. Of course there are times where that is absolutely the case without question. But there *are* times when other people or other situations can and should take priority. And anyone in your life who uses their 'priority status' to their advantage is worthy of some serious side-eye.", "I see that you are acknowledging how rude and cruel you were to your sister and will try to make amend, and I respect that. Not too many people here really accept the judgement. \n\nThere still is one thing that irks me though. What you said suggested that up until your wedding day, if something had happened to your sister or your parent, you would support them. But since you are now married, they are not really important or close anymore. So if they were gravely ill, you wouldn't do more than maybe send a \"get well\" card or an SMS? \n\nYou can care for and love more people than you have fingers in one hands. Because if love and care was so limited, every time parents had a new child, they would become less and less loving and caring for each child, up to a point where they'd be simply neglectful and abusive. Time is limited, but love and care is not.", "YTA. Shoulda just let your little sis go with you to the hospital and been happy knowing she loves you both and wants to be included.
