As long as you enable her she will keep using you to avoid her responsibilities.  It is sad but I think you can help her better from a distance. If you are able to help with child care si that she can work, you would still get some time to recharge when your house is quiet. \n\nJust give her a list of ways that you are willing to help, but housing them is not one of them.  \n\nThat will be 7 kids under 11 - without stability.  That's irresponsible of her and their fathers", "NTA but eviction through the court takes so long you better file now", "Inconsiderate people take and take from you until you have nothing left to give, then get upset and say you don't care and aren't doing anything for them.  Meanwhile, they have done nothing to help themselves all the time  you were helping them.  They put the consequences of their bad decisions on you ( \"How can YOU let me be on the street?\").  Then they rally the troops by telling everyone how mean you are to them.   No good deed goes unpunished.\n\nNTA.  Daughter has to learn to be an adult and take care of herself and her children.  I know it wasn't an easy decision but you need to protect your sanity.  For those telling you that you should let her stay, pass on their info to your daughter as potential places to live.", "NTA\n\nThats way too long to be taken advantage of.\n\nGood on you for standing up and saying enough is enough", "Nta, the only thing that *might* make you the asshole is that you've made it far too comfortable for her to take advantage of free rent. You should have been on them to get their shit together.", "ESH \u2026 but maybe give her three months. You sort of enabled her and now are pulling the plug.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019ve housed an additional 8 people for a year and a half. The audacity your daughter has is truly off the charts. My mouth is still hanging open after reading your post thrice.", "NTA\n\n> 27 year old\n\nWell then she shouldn't be in your house *in the first place!*\n\n> She has 6 kids\n\nNo. That is *already* **too damn many**.", "NTA\n\ndon't set yourself on fire to keep other people warm", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s been 1.5 years. They\u2019ve had plenty of time.", "Oh, ffs.\n\nOf course you're NTA. Your daughter keeps having kids she can't afford, while expecting you to take care of her entire family. \n\nThat's beyond entitlement. That is her literally not giving a shit about you. She takes everything from you with zero regard for how it affects you.\n\nThe only asshole thing you've done was to let her get away with it for this long.", "NTA - they don't even care that you're supporting them. The entitlement is strong here. Good luck with the fallout.", "NTA Your daughter has been having babies since she was 16 years old. If she hasn't figured out how not to get pregnant by now, she never will.

You have enabled this more, more, more than enough.", "NTA, but it would have been better to set boundaries a long time ago. your daughter and her boyfriend need to grow up and maybe this will be a life lesson to them.

But I don\u2019t have the heart to do that. \n\nYour daughter has taken advantage of you. She is making her life choices, emergencies and drama, YOUR life choices, emergencies and drama.

To me that says she almost doesn\u2019t even see OP as her mother, just free room, board and childcare.  Going straight to \u201cI\u2019ll go to the police\u201d and blasting her on Facebook is gross.   \n\nI think the only thing OP is TA about is not setting a lot of boundaries a lot sooner.  Obviously her daughter feels like she can use and abuse her parents and they\u2019ll continue to take it.", "My daughter says she don\u2019t like the effects it has on her body and won\u2019t take it. She tried at one point said she was throwing up every single day. I\u2019ve never been on it so I\u2019m not sure how it makes you feel, but that\u2019s what she said.", "Please don't say sexist things like that. It takes two people to make a baby.

All the time in the world isn't going to change that \u2014 short of the kids growing up and leaving.\n\nThey'll be as fucked in a year as they are today.

Then my daughter said they were unable and she was on maternity leave which eventually turned into her quitting, she jus got this job a few months ago she had, which she got by my husband pressuring her to work bc they were hassling us for money. My issue is I\u2019ve always been too nice.", "She probably thinks she'd get the house and everything else since she already lives in it. People like that don't get along well with logical thinking.", "She knows she can\u2019t afford to raise seven kids, let alone afford to keep a roof over her head. Her plan (or lack thereof) was to stay home where she thought she couldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t get evicted by her own parents. Instead, she and her fianc\u00e9 are just birthing more children into poverty. NTA\n\nMy money says that in two months, she\u2019s going to keep begging for more time instead of putting in the work to find a new place.", "This is what I was thinking! It sounds like this woman has never used protection. Also, if you\u2019re living with your parents with 6 kids, you can\u2019t afford a 7th!

I now don't use the Pill at all.\n\nThere are other forms of contraception she can use. She should try them. Do they at least use condoms?", "What about condoms?", "So basically, she just plans on popping them out as frequently as she feels like it and letting her whole family freeload off you. You will never be free of this.", "It always takes two to make the baby, but when the woman gets pregnant, the choice is all hers? \nCan\u2019t have it both ways. If she kept her legs closed, she wouldn\u2019t be in this predicament and yet she\u2019s gonna make it everybody else\u2019s fault.", "They are taking advantage of you, plain and simple. Kick those freeloaders out and don't look back.", "The reality is, she has made the decision over and over to have kids that she can\u2019t afford and to simultaneously not prevent or end additional pregnancies.  I would presume you\u2019ll need to evict them, unfortunately.", "I hope she\u2019d use them, I had taught her about them growing up. I assume she isn\u2019t being very safe though", "What married woman \"keeps her legs closed\"? Would you, if you were a husband, abstain?", "Yes, it is the case that it requires two people to make a baby, but once the baby is made the pregnancy burden falls primarily on the woman which is why she is favoured when it comes to making the choice.\n\nThat's human biology for you.", "She needs to stop having children she can not afford!   \n\n\nYou need to put a clear boundary, I feel sorry for the children because she clearly is not caring for them enough.", "But you have known since she was 16 that the lesson didn\u2019t take. \n\nNTA, but the time for tough love was years ago and now the situation is just beyond untenable for all."]}
