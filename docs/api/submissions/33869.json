Let's see how long that arrangement works before they've miraculously found a place. Making him put a ring on it would be a huge reality check for them both. \n\nIt might be a good time also to pay some close attention to the kids and what the dynamics are like there.

Her life as anything other than a potential broodmare is over.

She probably thought you would allow them to stay indefinitely (especially with a new baby). Hence why they never bothered to save up.
