Pure trash.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nMy sister left her husband 10 years ago and moved in with our parents. She has 3 kids. The youngest is now a senior in high school. The middle one bought a house, and the oldest still lives there as well, but there is a restraining order between the middle and oldest. Oh, and she still hasn't divorced her husband, paid off any of her debt, and doesn't contribute to bills. \n\nGood luck, and I hope they actually move out soon.", "NTA. One year plus an additional two months without rent is very generous. Maybe one of her FB friends will take her in but I doubt it.", "NTA she can\u2019t even support herself and she\u2019s adding a 7th child??", "I would have suggested it after baby #2", "They\u2019ve had 18 months to make a plan", "I would seriously like the post and reply \u201cyep that\u2019s me finally putting my foot down. 7 kids by 27 is too much.  Time to support yourself\u201d. \n\nOp you would be YTA if you let her stay. Def NTA.", "7 children\u2026 when maybe they couldn\u2019t even support 2? Have these people not heard of condoms? Those poor kids. Absolutely NTA", "Too little too late.", "Do not do this OP! Do not even offer. They will continue to bleed you dry.", "The parents could have done everything right and had a daughter like this. I hate it when people automatically blame the parents, especially watching mine do everything right and my middle brother still became a drug-addict mess. Daughter is an adult and she literally f- around and is now in the finding out phase.", "Neither houses nor mobile homes are cheap these days, and OP's daughter is currently paying $0 in rent and still asking for help with her other bills. \n\nOP's financial obligations here are finished. She's been more than generous.", "Thank you! And for not judging. It\u2019s been a long day \ud83d\ude05", "OP.  The longer she stays, the more she is taking advantage of you and your husband.  You know that. I don\u2019t think you can just kick them out to be homeless (I\u2019m thinking solely of your grandchildren here) but you can help them find subsidized or low income housing.  Then they are on their own.  The bank of mom & dad is closed.  What they are doing to you is grossly unfair.  Good luck.", "They're beyond boundaries, new chances and compromising.  Stick to your guns and let them figure it out themselves now, they are adults and you have zero responsibilities to your grandchildren.  At least that's how things should work.", "I think from the beginning, you should\u2019ve charged them rent and then saved it for them. My", "So setting boundaries doesn\u2019t mean asking what their plans are. Setting boundaries is saying ahead of time hey we really can\u2019t handle any more people here so we ask no more children as long as you\u2019re in our house and we have a firm end date of x in mind. That would give you this amount of time to save money and you will be expected to move out by x date regardless of if you save or not. You can say it nicer, you can say it meaner- but a boundary is telling someone what YOU are going to do to protect yourself.\n\nEdit: to be clear from comments I\u2019m getting- I\u2019m in no way saying OP holds any sort of responsibility or fallout from her daughter\u2019s choices. As a recovering people pleaser and someone who has struggled in the past to understand why people don\u2019t respect my boundaries I simply wanted to share what I learned which is that it\u2019s up to me to respect and enforce my boundaries. Obviously OP is NTA and is being grossly taken advantage of here", "Part of the problem is the really shitty economy we have given this generation.  Wages are in the toilet versus cost of goods/living.  Being a chef is really low paying work. Even if they could save up, I am skeptical they could get a mortgage because of their low incomes.\n\nI sympathize with you too.  I get that you were looking forward to your own place.  \n\nWe collectively made this bed, now we have lie in it.", "> bc they were hassling us for money.\n\n . . . I'm sorry, what? On top of living rent free in your house, not having a job and clearly just f-cking like bunnies, they're demanding money?\n\nLady, this is beginning to sound like a hostage situation for you. I hope all the NTA comments here give you enough confidence to realize you're doing the right thing.", "If anything, reality says I'm right. You think OP's daughter just became a mother of 7 kids with 3 different fathers on her own? I'm guessing some kind of family dynamic, probably religion, prevented OP and her husband from having honest, frank conversations w/ the daughter regarding pregnancy and their perilous socioeconomic situation. OP also stated that she \"never complained to \\[her\\] daughter because \\[she\\] believe\\[d\\] family is very important.\" There's a not-so-fine line between boundary setting and complaining, and it doesn't seem like OP did anything to give her daughter notice that OP would kick them out if they had another kid.", "How can you call OP AH for something that\u2019s in the past? OP didn\u2019t set boundaries, IN THE PAST, but it\u2019s not too late.", "Probably to feeding, clothing, and transporting six kids.", "Stop telling OP what she should have done.  That ship has sailed.", "Clearly, you're right, but in OP's defense, I would imagine that she & her husband hadn't thought to express to their daughter & her partner their expectation that the breeding would pause *because they assumed* (erroneously, as it turns out, but not unreasonably), *that a couple w/6 children unable to keep a roof over any of their heads would know enough to delay their efforts to personally overpopulate the world until their financial situation stabilized*!!!!", "If they already have 6 children, crammed into 2 rooms at her parents house, no one should have to blatantly tell her not to have more children.", "No one needs that many children either\u2026 just WHY?!", "I agree the smartest move would have been abstinence because you can't get pregnant if you don't have sex. And maybe she wouldn't be looking at her 7th pregnancy in 11 years.\n\nBut the laws have changed in the last year or two when it comes to reproductive rights and access to birth control. Maybe #7 wouldn't have been an issue under past laws. \n\n\nSadly, some people don't have any foresight on what to expect if they make XYZ choice. Even if they've been shown the consequences. It seems like OPs daughter lacks foresight."]}
