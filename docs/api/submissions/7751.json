Most memorable one was when the child made a entire powerpoint slide presentation telling her father who was reaching out that he failed and to go away.

Just admit you aren\u2019t a good person and move .", "Im sure that happens to all sorts of parents of all sorts of sick children. That doesn't make it acceptable.\n\nIn this case it makes that woman a horrible step-parent.", "Which part?", "It's baked into our fairy tales, I guess.", "It really sounds like you\u2019re doing what you need to do to be the best mom you can be for your kiddo! It\u2019s *hard* work to unpack all of that stuff from your own life and I\u2019m really proud of you for doing it. It\u2019s going to make a huge difference for your son.", "Wait\u2026you didn\u2019t even meet this woman until AFTER he decided to marry her ? My heart goes out to you as a mom..You are already a better man than your dad so just keep doing what you\u2019ve been doing .", "AITA is one of those strange sub-reddits where bad opinions can be the most popular ones. Just because you\u2019re in little echo chamber where lots of people agree with you doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re right", "It\u2019s not a fact, all you have is the brief one-sided take from a son who hates his father. You don\u2019t have the facts about this situation. Everything OP wrote could well be a lie", "i'm just personally shocked no one mention monetary support atp, she left right after her son was buried and he already helped her most of her son\"'s life to pay for most of his treatments to the disregard of his own child, the situation was perfect for her to abuse. she just didn't care about him.", "She had the concentration to marry a guy that was willing and apparently wanted to help take some of the weight off her shoulders..OPs dad doesn\u2019t sound like he would have needed a lot of encouragement or chasing", "What?", "Thank you. It really is hard but I\u2019m learning. I\u2019m lucky to have my moms and stepdads sides that are all very supportive so that really helps.", "So, you think the son is the asshole?  Is your reasoning also disrespecting your elders and self entitledment or something more concrete?", "I mean we're also getting a third-hand account here so I will still take this with a grain of salt.\n\n80-90% of couples get divorced within a year after the death of a child. That means the divorce isn't shocking to me in the slightest, nor is it a cause for worry / speculation that she was just marrying OP's dad for the money. As well, leaving \"right after\" the funeral is also a normal part of grief - avoidance - many many parents cannot sleep in their home after losing a child. They'll sleep anywhere else, in a car, in a hotel, on a couch, but approaching your own home when you've just had such a loss can be difficult. After the avoidance is the stage that typically breaks a marriage - the anger stage of grief, where you're still avoiding the death, still trying to deny it, and getting mad at others for not feeling as hurt as you do.\n\nBut I've also heard \"Janice left right after our daughter died\" (names changed, but in my social circle) and I found out it was actually \"a month after the funeral\" and \"with communication about how she couldn't stay in the home after losing their daughter, but Craig didn't want to sell the house or move to another house because he'd rather keep the bedroom as a shrine to their lost child, while the room and memories were too painful for Janice to deal with\". And neither was wrong, and Craig and Janice are still friends, but their marriage didn't survive the difference in how they grieved. And they didn't want to fight over it either, because telling another person \"you didn't love our daughter as much because you grieve differently\" is not appropriate or healthy.", "That decision was made, in fairness, because the treatment was very, very unlikely to do any good and absolutely certain to cause the dying child trauma and pain. Sometimes it is better to just let things be because traumatizing a child and denying them the chance to die as peacefully and painlessly as possible is not a reasonable price to pay for a miniscule amount of possible hope.", "That's what Medicare / Medicaid is for (US, anyway).\n\nWhen OP's dad was damn near indigent already, he had no business reallocating funds away from enriching his own child's life.", "Well some people read that he was the victim of neglect which is definitely not concrete. Some people read he was entitled as being a concrete take. I read that he hated his dad because he was told he was not he was his father\u2019s only priority. He  literally wrote that in his post so that you can take that as concrete. I don\u2019t know what the situation at home was, I have to go by what OP writes, and to cut off his father over one argument, to hold a grudge that long and to top it off have no compassion for his father who has lost two wives and a step son that makes him a big asshole in my book", "I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a decision for a government to make .", "To take from a very smart commenter, everyone is entitled to their opinion."]}
