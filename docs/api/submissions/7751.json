Your father prioritized his new wife and step-son over you and expected you to be fine with giving up your life to accommodate them.  You did well for yourself in creating a new healthy life for yourself.

I resent him for choosing to get into a marriage to help her and her son when we could have done with some help ourselves before that.

OP seems heartless  and incredibly immature.", "That's the thing, they didn't have that money. Why on earth anyone would agree to help someone when they can even help themselves? And don't come to me with the bs of good person or something like that. You need to be good before agreeing to help anyone.", "So they should have stopped the life-extending medical treatments for a terminal toddler so that the OP can have take-out food more often?", "No, he shouldn't accept a responsibility before clearly one before. He was just adding depth to amount of money they don't have. Let me ask you something, if you were struggling and you have a family would you be helping another family at the expense of your own?", "How is this a real question?? If helping extend my stepchilds life meant my bio child had to be inconvenienced with homemade meals or unfortunately couldn\u2019t do extracurricular activities, OF COURSE I\u2019d choose to pay for my stepchild\u2019s medical treatments.
