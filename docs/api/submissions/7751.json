Most memorable one was when the child made a entire powerpoint slide presentation telling her father who was reaching out that he failed and to go away. Sick or not, putting one child constantly in front of the others needs will only breed resentment to the point that it will end up with the parents left with nothing.

Because he ONLY wants OP\u2019s MONEY because he gave all his away to pay medical bills \u2026which BTW if this was in the US the kid would have received MEDICAID through the state and even could have been treated at St Jude for free so it was for naught. Dad is a SPERM DONOR period. I\u2019d get a restraining order if he shows up again and I\u2019d block him from all socials and let everyone know that if I found out they were funneling him ANY info about me they would be cut off too", "It does helps the the majority agree with my opinion.", "You have absolutely no proof for your statements.", "Hey, we can't all agree on everything. I am absolutely biased by growing up as the eldest sibling in a large blended family who helped provide when our parents couldn't. People complaining about not getting takeaways when I was skipping meals daily at certain points kind of grinds my gears. I don't regret my choice because I made sure those little ones went to bed with food in their belly. It has coloured my experience and morals so I am unable to ignore the sick toddler who died.\n\nAgain I accept I'm in the minority here. The fact that we have free healthcare in my country makes it hard to empathise too because there is no way that would happen to a child here. They would get all treatment available and this would never have been an issue.", "Oh also we have the fact that OP'S father remarried only two years after his mother passed and decided to be father to his wife's kid while stopping being father to his own son.", "Woah dude chill. It's AITA - When did I say he was my hero? \n\nAgain, I'm not from the US so at 17 OP wouldn't be a minor here and I don't understand the in and out of you guys fucked up healthcare system.", "And that's why I said probably.  I can only especulate. And this poor woman isn't being judged. OP's father is the AH. And now wants to come from woodwork to get money from OP when he didn't help OP succeed actually made it more difficult.", "Well we can all definitely agree that the biggest asshole in this story is the US healthcare system.\n\nHonestly, imo, when stories like this crop up, the money part is the smallest of the reasons to be resentful. Not having parental affection is brutal. Reminds me of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/ry6gym/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_only_have_one/) post.", "Our healthcare system , frankly , isn\u2019t any more \u201cfucked up\u201d than my Canadian friend being told she had to wait 7 YEARS to have the surgery to get her gallbladder removed - she was in daily pain. I was sick for YEARS in the US with no insurance except what the state offers to the disadvantaged ..more ER visits than I care to count and I\u2019m not millions of dollars in debt . When they figured out it was something that required surgery , I was in an OR by the end of the week . I seem to remember a story about a baby being forcibly removed from life support against the wishes of his parents AND weren\u2019t permitted to have him transferred to another hospital here in the US that was willing to take him for free out of the UK", "Fair I definitely downplayed that aspect in my gut judgment."]}
