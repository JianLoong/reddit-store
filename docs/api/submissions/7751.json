Most memorable one was when the child made a entire powerpoint slide presentation telling her father who was reaching out that he failed and to go away. Sick or not, putting one child constantly in front of the others needs will only breed resentment to the point that it will end up with the parents left with nothing.

It has coloured my experience and morals so I am unable to ignore the sick toddler who died.\n\nAgain I accept I'm in the minority here.

That means the divorce isn't shocking to me in the slightest, nor is it a cause for worry / speculation that she was just marrying OP's dad for the money. As well, leaving \"right after\" the funeral is also a normal part of grief - avoidance - many many parents cannot sleep in their home after losing a child. They'll sleep anywhere else, in a car, in a hotel, on a couch, but approaching your own home when you've just had such a loss can be difficult. After the avoidance is the stage that typically breaks a marriage - the anger stage of grief, where you're still avoiding the death, still trying to deny it, and getting mad at others for not feeling as hurt as you do.\n\nBut I've also heard \"Janice left right after our daughter died\" (names changed, but in my social circle) and I found out it was actually \"a month after the funeral\" and \"with communication about how she couldn't stay in the home after losing their daughter, but Craig didn't want to sell the house or move to another house because he'd rather keep the bedroom as a shrine to their lost child, while the room and memories were too painful for Janice to deal with\". And neither was wrong, and Craig and Janice are still friends, but their marriage didn't survive the difference in how they grieved.

Even in situations where they were together from birth, children often get less attention than they need if they have a disabled sibling who needs a lot of care.
