I\u2019ll pay for his tuition no matter what college he attends and I\u2019ve never suggested otherwise.\r  \n\r  \nBut AITA for asking that my godson applies to this particular university?

I was more curious why this family in particular as they seem rather entitled to it vs just raw appreciation that many other families would feel. \n\nNo need to answer if it\u2019s prying, but I\u2019m always interested in what motivates people to do big, personal gestures - especially one\u2019s that can help a family break free from the generational chains of poverty. It\u2019s a beautiful gift.\n\nI was friends with an owner of a 12 person business that pledged college educations for all their employee\u2019s kids after his business was bought out. He\u2019s still quite wealthy, but quite a compassionate gesture.", "NTA.\n\nthe way i am reading into this is you\u2018ve just opened his eyes to the fact that he could go _anywhere._ that\u2018s the real issue your sister is having. where did she go to school?", "You can't live through this kid. Jesus. Omg. Leave him be.", "It's very kind of you to pay for college, but it's a wild concept that godparents are chosen because they'll fund their kid's life so the actual parents don't have to. Congrats on having \"fuck-you\" level money to be able to do this!\n\nUltimately, it's his choice. You put the school on his radar, but you might want to let him know you won't be offended if he doesn't apply. You've set him up to feel that, if he doesn't apply, he's disappointing you or that his financial backing could be shaky. If he got in and went elsewhere, how would you feel? He might worry that you'll resent him for abandoning your dream.", "The concept is to choose someone who would be a great role model and possible guardian should the minor lose both parents. It\u2019s not supposed to be about money. This just added a new layer of ick to the story. NTA OP, but his parents are.", "Has he actually visited this school?", "YTA. You want to share an experience of this school with him? Take him on a visit, share your story, let him decide if it feels like a fit to apply.", "If he's not interested in going there, he shouldn't apply. It would be his time wasted as well as whomever has to review his application.", "He knew. He wanted to say thank you and that\u2019s when OP suggested he apply to their dream college", "They're his parents, and, believe it or not, may love seeing their kid regularly and worry about him. \n\nOP didn't give him an alternative way to thank her, so that's a big financial guilt obligation on his back.", "Well that sucks.\n\nBut still seems like a pretty small (even if a bit silly) ask from OP that is doing so much.", "The essay requirement is dumb. Especially for state schools. It seems likely that they aren't actually reading them. Who would the even have read them?", "This is a Common App application, they just plug your essays and resume and the like for you. It's very low effort and convenient- upload everything once, apply en masse.", "I 100% would not push him to go if he was accepted, I want him to go wherever he decides is right for him. As far as this specific school, my impression is that he's probably neutral about going there because it wasn't really on his radar and he hasn't picked a major yet. I think he might consider it more seriously if he got accepted but I don't know if it would outweigh his current top choice. At this point I wouldn't want to ask him because I think that would sound like I was pressuring him, though.", "[deleted]", "She made a suggestion. She didn\u2019t tell him he had to apply there. She just said it was her dream school, and if he wanted to say thank you, he could apply there. He could say thank you in another way if he wants. Him applying to this school is not contingent on her paying for his college. \n\nMy dad told me he would pay for my school if I went to a state college. I took him up on his offer, and now I have a college degree while also being debt free. I have no regrets about the choice I made. This kid doesn\u2019t even have to go to the school OP wants him to apply to and he gets any school he wants paid for. That sounds like a great deal to me.", "That's what I mean by baggage, I think she'll be upset if he goes to any school more than two hours away from their house. She didn't actually go to college herself.", "Out of all the story, this is the one thing you latched onto? OP literally only suggested he apply there because he wanted to do something to thank her. She doesn't care if he goes there, but if he applied and got accepted, she would feel good about that, even if he still decided to go somewhere else. And she would pay either way. OP is not TA in any way here", "I see where you're coming from. And I did make sure that he knew that I just wanted him to apply and there's no pressure for him to actually go to the school if he does get in.", "No. I love my kids, but if the best school for them is far away, then that's where they'll go. It's not about me. The parents are prioritizing their wants over what's best for their child. That makes them the AHs.", "He's only applying. No need to be hurt over that. He may not be accepted. He may not want to go.\nOP isn't saying that he has to go.", "Just because they love him and would worry about him doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok for them to be upset about this\n\nThe parents are not going to be able to see the kid necessarily regularly his whole life and that\u2019s ok. You can have a good relationship with parents even from a distance", "If my son wanted to go to college in a different part of the country and wasn't expressly doing it to get away from me and his father, we would move to wherever he wanted to go.", "I\u2019d be willing to bet OP would cover the application cost too.", "Admissions counselors read them. They are hired specifically for the purpose of admitting students. During application season, sometimes colleges bring on professors and other staff as temporary essay readers. Even state school admissions are extremely competitive, and many receive hundreds of thousands of applications every year.", "You already put pressure on him. It would had been better if you ensured that he owes you nothing and he doesn\u2019t have to apply to your dream school to get help going to school. You should make it clear to him that you don\u2019t care if he applies to the school unless he wants to. Giving strings and ideas are two different things. You gave a string with telling him what to do to thank you.", "No, it's not.\n\nGodmother : I'm paying for your college, so please for the sake of living vicariously for a moment, apply at this college out of state. \n No other strings attached. No need to accept.\n\nGodson: sure\n\n\nParents: *weeping & wailing & gnashing of teeth..* how dare my son even think of leaving home? \n*despairing tragic shrieking*\n\n\nThat's more like the reality of the situation. \n\nNTA", "Bruh. OP is paying for school, not the kid\u2019s parents.", "But why even apply if he doesn't actively want to end up there? There are hundreds of thousands of other high schoolers applying to college. It's careless and inconsiderate to throw out applications to places you don't actually want to go. What if he gets rejected and feels like he let you down?", "As long as there is no pressure NTA.  Maybe encourage him to not limit himself to schools that are close to home. Encourage him to go to schools that he is interested in wherever they are.   It can\u2019t hurt to apply, no decision has to be made immediately and maybe he will have an idea of what he wants to study soon.", "They're upset at him even applying. AHs.", "Most likely they will though because they will control everything he does to ensure he remains close to them. He gets in a relationship that mom and dad don\u2019t like? They\u2019ll try and break it up. He gets a job that requires him to move? They\u2019ll try and get him fired. His parents sound toxic just from the little bit in this post.", "What's wrong with them being upset at this? I don't see anywhere they are actually causing issues for the kid. I thought all feelings were valid?", ">You already put pressure on him.\n\nHonestly, who cares? If I had had the choice between adding one more application to my list or dealing with the banks & interest rates from my loans, I would've 100% applied to some random school to make my funder happy.", "In fairness I think most people who apply to multiple schools include safety schools and the like that they don't necessarily *want* to go to but seem like fine options, so I feel like this is more or less the same thing. But either way I don't think he'll feel like he's letting me down if he gets rejected, because he said himself that he thinks he probably won't get in and I told him that even if he doesn't the application was what I cared about.", "All feelings are valid. Inside yourself. All feelings should not be expressed, and some should only be expressed in certain ways.\n\nIs it ok for them to feel the way they do? Of course. Is it ok for them to limit the life of their kids due to their feelings? No.", "Why is the application so important to you? It's YOUR dream. Not his. It's truly unfair to put him in a situation where he might feel like he's disappointing you. If he gets in and doesn't go, how will you let it go? You haven't let it go for this long, so what makes you think you'll let it go next year?", "So your dream school is his safety school?", ">Why is the application so important to you? It's YOUR dream.\n\nI mean, I kind of feel like you answered your own question right there lol. \n\nBut more seriously, I'm not sure what you even mean in the second half of this comment. There's nothing to let go if he gets in and doesn't go, that's immaterial to me. I'm not fussed about where he ultimately goes to school.", "In terms of emotional investment in whether or not he gets accepted, I think it's probably equivalent."]}
