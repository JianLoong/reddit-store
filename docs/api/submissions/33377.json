So this week my godson and I were talking about his college plans and he said he wished he\u2019d known I was doing that for him so he could\u2019ve thought of a good way to say thank you. I told him that I would consider us even if he\u2019d apply to a certain university.\r  \n\r  \nThe only reason I want my godson to apply to this university is because once upon a time it was my dream to attend that school, but I let my high school guidance counselor talk me out of applying and I\u2019ve always regretted it. It would make me vicariously happy to see my godson get accepted to this university even if he decides afterwards he\u2019d rather go somewhere else.

I\u2019ll pay for his tuition no matter what college he attends and I\u2019ve never suggested otherwise.\r  \n\r  \nBut AITA for asking that my godson applies to this particular university? I think his parents are overreacting because of their own baggage but I can somewhat understand that they might have a point about it not being the right thing to have said, I could\u2019ve told my godson that he didn\u2019t need to do anything special to thank me.\r", "created_utc": 1703019697, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18mceyo/aita_for_asking_my_godson_to_apply_to_a_certain/", "score": 687, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not a gesture of thankfulness.", "but based on your story you've offered no other alternative for him to give you a thank you other than applying to this school, which I truly don't believe that you're dense enough to not understand that this obviously sets a precedent that this is the school you'd want him to accept admission to, which he obviously would given the enormous amount of money that you're effectively holding over his head - this is not to say that this was your intention but as someone who is currently applying to schools themselves if someone was paying for my entire education and my ability to go to a decent school depended on them then yeah i'd probably feel forced into attending their favoured school", "I'll say it; I don't believe this is no strings attached and the OP won't pressure to attend if accepted.", "Then how does he repay OP?", "It's just an application...", "Oh those goalposts will move!", "OP did not say they were in the USA.", "Even still, an essay is hardly much effort in comparison to having your college tuition paid for. If he had to go the scholarship route, he would be writing many more essays for much less money.", "You're assuming these people are american", "cue modern solutions meme", "SAME.", "By applying there. Literally sending a letter or whatever", "I'll say it: I busted my ass to earn scholarships and grants and still had the first 10 years of my adult life hamstrung by student loan payments. I'd have gone to any accredited, reputable college in the US if someone else was paying for my whole entire ride. Unless we're talking Ivys here, employers don't give a rat's ass where you went as long as you got that paper.", "I love my kids with the fire of a thousand suns - yet I still encouraged them to apply to colleges that were far away because those colleges would be great places for them to get the educational experiences THEY want to have.\n\nLimiting your child's opportunities because you think they should be very centering *your* feelings over their own goals and desires and futures is not what loving parents generally do. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Then maybe his own parents should pay for his college. That's a huge burden to place on someone else.", "I do in fact believe his parents want to see him and worry about him, I just think that makes them selfish assholes.", "They don't get to limit his options just because they have selfish feelings.", "1. You don't have to repay a gift.\n\n2. If there were a debt, as the OP stated all she wanted was for him to apply. It's repaid once he applies. So if he chooses to go elsewhere, he can just tell them that, or if he wants to avoid even the faint possibility of hurt feelings, merely tells them he wasn't accepted. It's quite simple actually.", "By saying thank you and succeeding in school?", "Yes, and what's he meant to do if he's accepted but doesn't want to go? OPs made it clear him going is how he can repay her.", "Instead of asking him to apply to YOUR dream school, you should be encouraging him to apply to HIS dream school. The one he thought was too expensive, too far, too pie-in-the-sky, maybe a reach.\n\nIt shouldn't be about the school itself. It should be about having big dreams and taking a shot at them.", "She didn\u2019t but she did say the mom wanted him to go to a state school.", "Even on the CommonApp, which makes your main essay (a.k.a personal statement), extracurricular activities, and letters of recommendation available to all colleges, each college still has its own supplemental essays that you have to write individually.

Doesn\u2019t make them \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d for that matter. They have a vested interest and legitimate one. OP on the other hand is just pissing about with some personal regret which has nothing to do with the kid involved.", "Yeah, I like the way it\u2019s \u2019you pay for his college but keep yer big yapper shut\u2019  parenting style. Inspiring.", "I hope this kid is *already* applying to *his* dream school, I can't imagine he hasn't thought of that already.", "It's not really pressure. It's applying to another school. It is literally not that big of a deal. It would be different if OP were saying that they won't pay if they don't go or don't apply even, but they aren't. It isn't a string, people are ridiculous thinking it is.", "If he's already applying to college and has already stated this is something he can already do, he probably has the time or the pre-written essays to plug in. It's not like colleges want anything original, it's a sob story or a success story in a specific style. Some schools make you write college application essays as a writing assignment, I just typed those up neatly and applied to colleges using those. Add to the fact that this isn't even a school he's interested in and I doubt he's going to make it a hardship for himself.\n\nSeriously, it's far more likely that he'll put in some drivel he wrote in English class and move on with his life than decide he suddenly wants to bet it all on black.", "Or Canada, where nothing you said would be relevant.\n\nOr Australia, where nothing you said would be relevant.", "Bit of a change since I did that. \n\nBasically, if you had a pulse, an SAT or ACT score high enough, and were a resident of the state, you could get into most state schools.\n\nYou might have needed further application processes to get into the specific school within the university (engineering, MD, even music), especially if it's a known strong suit of that uni.\n\nBut getting in and taking gen ed + some intro classes could go a long way towards that next step.", "LMAO, I just fucking choked on my water. Such a perfect mix of corporate talk and sass.", "I applied to Princeton.  I live in the midwest and if you asked my mom you'd think I did it to start my life as a serial killer.", "When their being upset means they are trying to control what their son does then yes it\u2019s wrong. If they were upset at the idea but not trying to control him it would be fine.\n\nOP isn\u2019t forcing the kid to go if he is accepted to this school, all he has to do is apply. Having options is a good thing", "I know it's freeeeeee college. I know so many people that would have gone anywhere that was free.

Many, especially the  state flagship schools, are not.", "That\u2019s sort of projection and sort of besides the point. How did we get to this place where people are required to no longer express their wishes anymore - and that it\u2019s harmful to hear it?
