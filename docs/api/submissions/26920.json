In the last year, I have taken her on two international vacations and bought her countless expensive gifts. Now, I know gifts don\u2019t equate to caring but I wanted to point that out. \nShe said I did nothing for her birthday but I got her a very nice gift she had been wanting and we had a nice dinner together at home with friends and family. \n\nShe also said I don\u2019t do anything to show her I care. I asked her to elaborate and she couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t. \nI work full time so that she can be a stay at home mom while I finish my masters degree and I am very present in my child\u2019s life and help her with everything for our child when I am at home. I usually leave for work around 8 and I\u2019m back home by 3:30. Rarely does it get later than that. \nI help with house work, I cook, I clean, I take care of my child.

It may be she's lacking something and doesn't know how to express it. She could be depressed, she could be feeling unchallenged in life, etc.\n\nI think it's time to have another sit-down with your wife.

Look at what she does for you.  Cook, buy things,  doing special things for you, saying nice things, physically touch, spending time with you and mirror it.", "Nah. I think she should elaborate more on what she means. Does she want more complements or physical gratification rather than just gifts?", "I recommend you both sound like your stuck in a routine that's what happens when you have kids that's normal but the thing about being married is keeping the spark and relationship alive. If possible get a baby sitter or send your kids to your parents house. Have a day where it's just you and her. I recommend both of you write things down on what you would like to improve in the marriage. Complement each other and say your thankful for her and you appreciate him this will go a long way. Also I recommend bubble bath what I did for my wife is set up rose petals candles romantic music and just had a bath with her and she loved it. Tease each other.\nGo out on dates.", "She\u2019s not gaslighting you, she\u2019s trying to tell you how she\u2019s feeling. I feel similarly in my relationship and also had a child last year. A lot of the things I feel this way about are hard to see and understand for him because it\u2019s just that- a lot of the unseen labor, mental load that he doesn\u2019t help me with. I feel like the project manager of our life and he reports to me, it\u2019s not a great feeling. Additionally post child a lot of the emotional intimacy is gone- he seems less curious about me, less invested, less interested. Part of it certainly is I lost myself a little for awhile there and feel he didn\u2019t notice. \n\nI\u2019m not saying your wife has the same feelings I\u2019m saying that learning who I am and who my husband and I are to each other post baby has been a big balancing act. It\u2019s been tough and beautiful. Our current greatest barrier to recovering missed intimacy and trust is that I don\u2019t feel I can speak openly with him about how I\u2019m feeling without him getting defensive or diving into shame and shutting down. Due to that he\u2019s not able to meet me where I\u2019m at and try and help or hear me. \n\nAgain, not saying it\u2019s the same but no matter where your wife\u2019s feelings are coming from, they\u2019re valid. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve done anything wrong, it doesn\u2019t mean you haven\u2019t. It\u2019s not about that at this point. I encourage you to try and listen to her and hear her without fixing it and without defending yourself (if she says I feel abandoned don\u2019t list the ways you haven\u2019t abandoned her- she\u2019s describing her feelings just try and listen). At this point just listen, absorb, evaluate and see how you can best support her but I believe openly and actively listening to her feelings will go a long way. I don\u2019t feel I can vote on this without more context.", "This sounds like she doesn\u2019t perceive love the way you do? If you don\u2019t do therapy together, please try to sit down and tell her that you don\u2019t understand what she is saying she needs and ask her to clarify and go from there. Try not to make it a blame game conversation. The goal is to make you both happier.", "OP why are you here asking US when you can just directly ask her what she wants and see if you can do that? Maybe gift giving is not her love language something else is. You need to simply ask her to communicate what she thinks is missing and if she still doesn't tell you then you can rest easy knowing you tried.", "Nah gift giving to some with a different love language see it as low effort. She probably wants you to remind her you appreciate, be affectionate, and try not live so monotonously?", "I'm wondering if she's depressed? Like, she isn't feeling loved because she feels unlovable or something. I know when I am feeling down about myself, you could march a parade through my house in my honor, and I'd wonder if you felt obligated or didn't really want to.", "NAH... I think your wife is unhappy. Being a SAHParent is not as satisfying as many believe it is going to be. It sounds like you are trying to be a good husband and you probably are. When people are unhappy, they often look to blame someone else because it easier. Suggest that she might do well to get some councelling. Either on her own or together. With the goal of identifying what areas you both can work on. I hope she can find ways to be honest with you and herself. Best wishes", "NAH\n\nThere\u2019s just a disconnect here. How do you best receive love? How do you best show love? How does she receive love? How does she show it?\n\nIf you\u2019re taking her on vacations and spending money on her, but really she wants low-stakes quality time, there\u2019s going to be a disconnect. If she makes you dinner, but you want her to take you out for dinnerC there\u2019s going to be a disconnect. \n\nIt just sounds like your relationship is lacking emotional intimacy and you need to talk about how you both want to be met with love. Therapy could help here", "NTA, neither one of you are AHs.  You both have different love languages.  Helping around the house is nice and all but as partners those things need to be done.  Same with caring for the children.  A vacation or trip is a trip for the family.  The Birthday gifts are nice but maybe she does not want monetary gifts but instead to be touched and to have a relationship again outside of the kids.  Why not start having date nights, even if it is just sitting down and watching a movie or TV series together or join a bowling league or go out with friends from time to time.  Cuddling may or may not be what she wants, hard to say.  I know when I had small children to care for I mostly just wanted time to myself where no one touched me.  I would tell my husband I just want to sit in the bathroom and stare at the wall and not have to think for 5 minutes.  As a SAHM we are on call 24/7 and it can get so tedious and we can burn out.  Give yourself and her something fun to look forward to so she can get thru the days, weeks, months.  Get a babysitter and make sure to make your relationship a priority.", "NAH. It seems like you two just have different love languages. I can relate because my love language is acts of service and gifts. But my husband is physical touch and quality time. It\u2019s been very difficult for us, especially after two kids, to meet each others needs. Definitely talk about it together and possibly get therapy. I\u2019ve been married 10 years and we have a 6 & 5 year old. Honestly it\u2019s only gotten worse because we have not worked on it adequately together.", "NAH. This is a case where neither of you are t a, but there is a lot of unknown information and miscommunication. I think the two of you should probably seek couples therapy. She may or may not individual therapy as well. Please think on how you, she, and your relationship has changed since the baby was born. Are there things that you, she, or the two of you together did that you don't do anymore? And it doesn't even have to be big things, it could really be something as small as you complimenting how she looks one day or cuddling up and watching a movie etc. She may be struggling with some thing internally that she doesn't know where they stem from or how to communicate those feelings. I know when I got pregnant I gained a LOT of weight and it was something I have not been able to lose even 11 years later, and it still makes me uncomfortable. Suffice to say there could very easily be a lot more going on here than either of you realize. And while it socks to hear her say she doesn't feel like you care about her, she is still allowed to feel that way and I feel it's better to express that so the two of you can hopefully come to some common ground vs bottling it up until she explodes.", "NTA. Is she depressed? She sounds depressed. Try and communicate with her again, ask her what you can do to help her feel more loved. If she still can\u2019t tell you, suggest therapy because she doesn\u2019t seem herself. It could be mild PPD is she still breastfeeding? Once she stops breastfeeding she will start to feel  more like herself again. It usually takes about 4-months to stabilize emotionally after stopping.", "She probably just needs some anti depressants and to leave the house regularly.", "NAH. It's sometimes hard to specify what you need when it looks like you have everything. Real-life example - my husband's family came visit and they stayed with us. I had no idea they were staying with us and so I was unprepared. And since I'm an introvert, that meant building time into our itinerary for me to be alone and have time to recharge. When my husband suggested an activity I usually love, I declined to be able to get some alone time. I even suggested they go try out a new restaurant he was excited about that I didn't care about as much. Instead, they cut the activity short and came home for dinner but he had brought me a gift from the activity. That I neither asked for nor wanted. It looked like an extremely generous gesture that I did not want. What I wanted was 2 hours of peace and quiet and to not have to figure out dinner for everyone. We've since had conversations where I lay out my needs in much clearer detail. If she can't offer specific answers, ask her specific questions. And really listen to her answers.", "Well that may be true it does sound like he\u2019s being very thoughtful with everything he does and is working very hard to provide the best life for them also why can\u2019t she just simply communicate what\u2019s wrong you can\u2019t be expected to read minds he has no chance to fix it if she won\u2019t say what\u2019s wrong", "NTA.  You asked her what she means and she cannot elaborate on what she means.

She may also be struggling with her identity since becoming a mom.", "NTA but it sounds like therapy might help. If she\u2019s a sahm it might be less that she needs something from you and more needs outside contact. How often is she able to leave the house without the baby? How often does she see her friends? Some therapy at lest for her, if not for both of you, might help shed some light.", "NTA but I need more context", "You need to take the love language test. I think ur wife\u2019s love language is different then urs, she just wanta to be apperciated by her love language", "Could she be depressed?", "I agree.\n\nOP: With all due respect, y'all need couples therapy and not AITA.

OP should look into love languages and maybe have a conversation with his wife about what makes them both feel the most loved. I\u2019m not much for expensive gifts either. While they are nice and I appreciate them, I usually feel the most loved with words of affirmation, physical touch, and small acts of service. Everyone is different though so it\u2019s important to figure out what you both need from each other.
