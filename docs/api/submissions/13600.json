In the end, we decided to hold onto the car until our trip to Disney this past week. \n\nI checked Carvana again and they offered me more. This time $16,500.

Just a bit odd in my opinion, you've already delayed them this vehicle and now you're proposing they give you more money. If you're planning on cleaning the vehicle and getting maintenance done before transferring ownership, then you're NTA for asking for a bit more, but then communicate that. Since you didn't mention any of those, I'll assume you're not doing that and only want extra cash after giving your brother & his wife a lower asking price.

Apparently it wasn\u2019t the first time but I didn\u2019t look into that", "It is a different world. I bought my outback a little over a year ago. Used Subarus also hold their value and they did before the pandemic but man\u2026. It was tough finding one with the boxes I wanted checked in the price I was hoping to get, which was a pre pandemic price. Got quite an education. Took several months and I still had to compromise in a couple of places.", "Incorrect - UCC governs sales of goods, common law governs sales of services.  SoF applies to goods over $500 among other things (leases over 1 year, for example).  The UCC has some special merchant provisions, but nowhere is merchant status required for the UCC to apply, or for the SoF to require a writing (if it was, then I could claim my neighbor orally agreed to buy my dog for $50,000 and try to enforce it and say \"well we aren't merchants so no writing is required).  I'm an attorney and I teach bar exam preparation, and this is a CLASSIC mistake people make on the bar exam to equate merchant status with the UCC governing or the SoF applying.", "sales of goods worth >$500 between individuals are still covered by the statute of frauds at common law. there may be states where the statute of frauds is codified differently in state law from the most common version, but I think it\u2019s still fair to say most likely it would apply here. IANAL sort of (JD but not yet licensed), this is not legal advice, etc", "Sure, why not. Force them to sell it to you for $14k and then sell it to carvana for $16k. Then turn around and buy something for $12k and pocket the $4k to buy a billboard with picture of your brother and a hand drawn d*ick on his face.", "There's also thousands of other countries, all with their own laws! No one can talk on Reddit with full authority without having all the details AND having the appropriate knowledge.", "Yeah this person just made word salad out of the different contract provisions.  I see it all the time with my students.", "**EDIT**: \"7 hours at 70mph\" is 490 miles, not 420. The 450 miles the person above you said is an average of only 64.3 mph if they drove it in 7 hours. That's very believable.\n\nYou can realistically average 70 mph if most of your driving is on rural interstates. I've averaged more than that before, and I tend to drive slower than most drivers.", "I dont know why people are downvoting you lol promissory estoppel requires damages and there aren\u2019t any demonstrably here\u2026 reddit is confusing", "Yeah, that's illegal!\n\nHeh.", "And 80 is actually kinda slow for the 5, I have to stay in the right lane", "I haven't clicked the link, but I hope you didn't just doxx yourself.", "The votes on this are hilarious. Actual lawyer here, zero chance.\n\nPromissory estoppel is missing an element, just like the oral contract has zero legal effect due to the statute of frauds. You\u2019re totally right to look at it as an option, so I\u2019m not knocking the creativity. \n\nBut you could not make this argument any more effectively than trying to rely on the verbal agreement. No lawyer is taking this case because you can\u2019t make a viable argument that the brother can\u2019t just buy an equivalent car at the same price and move on.\n\nYou can also flip this the other way: would OP be able to force the sale to the brother or claim damages of ongoing carrying costs based on detrimental reliance on the refused promise to buy? Of course not.", "My guess is that it's because Reddit votes on how they wished things worked, not how they actually work.\n\nThe poor poster who (correctly) identified that a verbal contract for the sale of goods over $500 is only worth the paper it's printed on has been blasted to -100 while the poster who said it's a verbal contract (which is unenforceable here) is +300.\n\nPeople want the asshole OP to be on the hook for something. Legally, he's not (by law, he's entitled to be a greedy, duplicitous asshole here), but it's not a satisfying answer for the masses.", "No, I\u2019m not a dumb idiot", "Yeah, the votes were really weird to me?? You made excellent points, and I was just putting the idea up as if I was issue-spotting on one of my exams. \ud83e\udd72\nThe element isn\u2019t met (or it would be so tenuous that you\u2019d have a losing case basically right out the gate, if the client insisted on trying the case anyway), so I thought your analysis was spot on, honestly.", "YTA u agreed to sell it for a certain price. Kept them waiting so u could take it on vacation putting extra mileage on it for 3 month then u have the nerves to ask for $2000 more then the agreed price. Ur not trying to do right by ur kids. Ur trying to screw over ur brother if anything u should have knocked some money off of the price for the added mileage and hassle of waiting for 3 months", "Might be the biggest asshole I've come across here in some time", "you suck dude. hope you don\u2019t need babysitting from the family you screwed over in the future because i\u2019d tell you and the kids you apparently can\u2019t afford to take a looooong hike. yta", "YDTA. You agreed upon a price months ago and these two are waiting to buy your car so they can continue with their lives. You shouldn't have even offered to sell it if you weren't actually ready to get rid of it yet", "Seeing right through op\u2019s bs lmao", "When I was 21 my mother bought a 2010 Mazda 2 second hand in 2013, fully expecting that she would sell it to me after I got my license and would be ready to buy a car. This is not at all something I EVER asked her to do, but she still will carry on like it was a great favour that I squandered away. I never got my license until I was 27 after I had a surprise baby, then I chose to prioritise saving for a deposit for a home loan so still haven\u2019t bought a car at 30. Now after busting my ass I\u2019m in a financial position to buy a brand new vehicle that suits our lifestyle and no thanks ma, I still don\u2019t want to buy your 1.2L hover mombile.", "Op confirmed in a comment they did indeed drive there", "No wonder why he needs more money. He just got back from Disney. Now he wants his brother to cover the whole bill. \u201cWell Disney was $2k more than I expected soo we\u2019re gonna need you to cover that\u201d", "Jesus, we\u2019ve paid that much for a Mercedes c class with 30k miles on it. How can Carvana justify this value for a car with 3x more mileage on it?\n\n\nBtw - YTA", "N t a? Not judging your judgment but op literally waited months to sell them the car and at last minute changed the price bc of a car company trying to make more money", "Did you skim through the post?", "Dude you suck", "OP is gonna run around in life treating all of their extended family and friends like shit just saying \"oh I'm just trying to do right by my kids\".", "I could understand if the brother was the one saying wait but he made them wait while using the car AND increased the price?\nYta", "This is not the deal you're looking for.", "Nice reference \ud83d\ude0e", "You added MORE miles? Bro that decreased the value \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Dude. Get a mini van. Not too hard of a choice with three kids.", "Minivans are plentiful", "So you changed the mileage on the car, as well as tire ware, oil, everything else.  Do you normally try to screw over family?", "Well then you\u2019ll realise how hard it is for your brother who has a baby and has agreed to buy your car and is patiently waiting while you mess him around with when he\u2019ll get it and adding to the price! \nSelfish.", "Boohoo you said it was a business deal. Your personal problems have nothing to do with the deal you made with them.", "You have some nerve asking for MORE MONEY after driving it to DISNEY WORLD. What is wrong with you?", "Then you shouldn\u2019t have made them that deal.\n\nAlso, you spent all this money at Disney and now have the nerve to screw over your brother?! Don\u2019t take vacations you can\u2019t afford.", "You were selling the car to your brother with the agreed upon miles at an agreed upon price.\n\nNow you're going on a long ass drive and **still** selling it to them, only this time for a couple grand more and more miles on top of that.\n\nYou're scamming your brother and I hope he sees this post.\n\nedit: If you want to talk about business, you both agreed on it at a certain price. You don't then get to change that because you want to be greedy and keep checking the price Carvana offered you.\n\nI know what you've probably done, you have gone on Carvana every single day crossing your fingers to see if the offer price is more. The moment it was MORE you were quick to notify your brother.\n\nTop comment in this thread is right, if the price dropped you wouldn't have said a single thing. You dirty rotten scammer", "Michael Scott, is that you?", "yeah but the kids? right", "Facts. The kinda guy who\u2019s like \u201cI\u2019ve been taking mom to her doctor appointments and spending my gas and putting miles on my car, so IM taking the car\u201d even tho they have a perfectly fine car and the other sibling doesn\u2019t.", "You must live in that city to afford that. Lucky mf", "\"Doing right by his kids\" by screwing over his brother's kids. Nice.  /s", "In todays vehicles, 100,000k is when they get scheduled for their first time up.  100k isn\u2019t crap anymore.  Even a Chevy Cruze can get 300k if it\u2019s babied", "Not for Toyotas.", "L reading skills", ">Not to mention the fact that these car buying companies always hammer you down on the price when you take it in anyway. YTA op", ">onded s\n\nMy wife sold her car (great condition) to my brother for about 1/2 the value.   I gave my old (but reliable) SUV to my brother and SIL when they had a baby.   But at the same time, my family has always been willing to help me with anything.", "LOL escape goats.  That's hilarious.\n\nWell, I'm about to go eat.  Bone apple tea!", "If I were the brother, I'd absolutely take him to court over this.\n\nYTA OP", "I can't wait for the rest of the family to find out. Sometimes ostracism is the best punishment", "Are you being sarcastic\uff1f", "$14k new car?\nDoes it fit more than 2 people?", "It's also accurate. I've had to chase them back into pens at work when they got out. \n\nYTA. They waited MONTHS for you. And you just got back from Disney and are whining about 'wanting to do right by your kids'? Really?", "I think I'm going to pick up \"escape goats\" now as well because that one got me chuckling haha", "'Scapegoat' literally derives from escape + goat (as in, 'scape' is an old word for escape), so it's not even wrong, in an etymological sense.", "Escape Goats is a redundant phrase based on what I know of them. \n\nA common farmer joke is that goats are so hard to contain that it's easier to fence them out and let them break in than vice versa.", "There is a fair chance text messages exist and if all the stages are in text such as offer, acceptance, agreeing on item etc are listed wouldn\u2019t that qualify as legally binging writing? I don\u2019t study law and know individual states and even counties can have different rules but I feel like I\u2019ve seen similar cases with text messages for over $500.", "Brother needs to contact a lawyer NOW", "Actually, verbal contracts ARE contractual. They're just much harder to prove.", "I want to get OPs brothers number so I can text him and let him know all of reddit thinks his brother is a huge trash bag.", "Yeah like not a fancy car but a good reliable family car, the used car I have now cost 5k brand new 10 years ago and it was the top of line at the time as well, all the sports pack etc on it, this is in the uk so I\u2019m not sure if that makes a difference but 14k would definitely go a long way for a new car here", "It's an accurate description of goats' characters, but it doesn't draw the parallel of the goat historically being used as an object of magical/mystical sin transference, which is what makes the metaphor relevant to this situation.", "Yeah that gets trickier, but typing a name to sign an email/text can qualify as an enforceable signature. Unsigned is harder to enforce, courts vary on that. And idk anyone who signs texts except my mom lol", "Get over it, it's AmITheAssHole and you, definitely sound like one (or two.)", "And also to just buy a reputable used or even new car.
