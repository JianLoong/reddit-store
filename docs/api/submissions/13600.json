In the end, we decided to hold onto the car until our trip to Disney this past week. \n\nI checked Carvana again and they offered me more. This time $16,500.

I didn't even consider raising the price on him or selling it to Carmax because my integrity, my word, and his friendship are worth a lot more than that.

I'd say YTA In about 90/10 of this interaction. On one hand, you kept delaying and now you're asking for more money. Why would you do that to your brother and his wife? Just a bit odd in my opinion, you've already delayed them this vehicle and now you're proposing they give you more money. If you're planning on cleaning the vehicle and getting maintenance done before transferring ownership, then you're NTA for asking for a bit more, but then communicate that. Since you didn't mention any of those, I'll assume you're not doing that and only want extra cash after giving your brother & his wife a lower asking price.

If it were the other way around where you were ready to buy your next car but couldn't do it until they bought your old one and the price of the new car went up, then yeah you would be justified in asking a higher price because THEY are the ones who fucked around, in this case you are the one that did the fucking around, so it should be your loss, not his.   \n\n\nBTW, if he really wanted to he could take you to court over it, and this post would be an excellent admission of breach of contract.", "That seems to assume they'd be buying from Carvana.", "And did they tell you their cut? \ud83d\ude44", "YTA. An unscrupulous one at that. You lack empathy and even the basic grasp of morals. You aren\u2019t selling your car to some random stranger, you\u2019re selling it to your brother. You agreed on a price and then tried to bump it up to make more money off him 3 months later. Then when you\u2019re relatedly told YTA, you argue it. Come back to us when you don\u2019t get your asking price. Please let us know how this all works out.", "Agreed but that\u2019s actually beside the point. OP had a verbal agreement with a family member and now he wants to renege. You know what\u2019s worse than not keeping your word? Treating the other party like you\u2019re doing them some sort of act of charity. OP, you\u2019re the worst type of asshole \u2014 a self-satisfied jerk.", "This! Also Carvana is literally a mess of a company that has been in legal trouble for some shady things. They\u2019re definitely not a reputable source for determining a car\u2019s value", "Unrelated to the post (OP is an AH imo)\n\nI'm not sure where you read the information about Carvana changing their offer, and maybe their policy changed since 2021, but I sold Carvana a highly modified car with a few cosmetic issues, and they didn't say anything or take any money off. If I remember correctly I got the money right away whereas with Vroom I had to wait a week or two for a check. \n\nMy experience with Carvana was actually very smooth, much better than Vroom (still paid as expected but very poor communication)", "I have a rav4 with just shy of 100k on it. My local dealer emails us weekly trying to get us to trade it in, and offering $18k.", "What he wants is to find the highest possible price, rip off his brother, and claim he's being fair. Yes. He is an AH."]}
