In the end, we decided to hold onto the car until our trip to Disney this past week. \n\nI checked Carvana again and they offered me more. This time $16,500.

Just a bit odd in my opinion, you've already delayed them this vehicle and now you're proposing they give you more money. If you're planning on cleaning the vehicle and getting maintenance done before transferring ownership, then you're NTA for asking for a bit more, but then communicate that. Since you didn't mention any of those, I'll assume you're not doing that and only want extra cash after giving your brother & his wife a lower asking price.

If he doesn\u2019t buy his new vehicle through Carvana, they\u2019ll probably offer $2.5k less after all said and done.", "Username checks out", "I, too, fart in his general direction.", "Well, so long as you\u2019re a trustworthy fart, I will allow it.", "Also, I find it strange and suspicious that his car\u2019s value increased by 15% in just 3 months\u2026 there\u2019s an error somewhere, and if not, that means Carvana isn\u2019t the best source for car value if it can fluctuate that far in a very short time.", "You\u2019d have no hope to prove damages. Even with constrained inventory, the brother has a wide selection of similar vehicles for $15K available for immediate purchase. It\u2019s a RAV4. There are literally millions of them.\n\nOP sucks, but isn\u2019t bound by law to sell the car.", "Yeah just last week it was in the news that they sold a guy a stolen Maserati. Once he took it to the dealer for service they called the cops cause they realized the car was stolen. Guy had to pull all his documents to show that he wasn\u2019t the one who stole it.\n\nAnd Carvana only refunded him after the news contacted him", "Yeah, the reason that happens is because most people think their cars are in much better shape than they actually are. They list a \u201cFair\u201d car as \u201cLike New\u201d, LMAO. Scratches and dents to them are \u201csmall imperfections\u201d, and all that. And then they can\u2019t believe that their car is lower in value than they\u2019re ere originally told.", "Where do you live that the Toyota dealership has the time or desire to keep track of the mileage of your very used car, begging you to sell it to them? Lol wtf", "It\u2019s not just mileage, it\u2019s also the year, the car\u2019s trim and package - specific model upgrades etc. You can\u2019t gauge another RAV4\u2019s value just based on matched mileage alone.", "Nah, I totally agree with you\u2014I don\u2019t think brother does have any real legal recourse here, but promissory estoppel was just what stuck out to me as being the best of bad options, if that makes sense. \n\nAgain, not a lawyer yet, so this is not legal advice in any way.", "Wants to rip off his family, who just had a baby, so he can \u201cdo right by his kids\u201d\u2026", "I\u2019m not in law in any way, but l feel like you\u2019ll have a hell of a time proving promissory estoppel as the buyer", "Yeah, that\u2019s what I said in my reply to the person above\u2014imo the main sticking point would be the damages (which, as the other person pointed out, would be minimal to none.)"]}
