I did not realize how much information I had left out. We live in an apartment. I work nights and take the dogs for a 2 hour hike before my shift, so I sleep in a bit longer if I can. I am a horrible sleeper so I am usually up before her anyways. So because I am awake before her I am taking them out the majority of the time, but when I can sleep in they are not taken out until I am woken by the whining and I get up and ask if they\u2019ve been out yet and she says she was just about to do it. \n\nEDIT: I completely understand what you guys are saying about commenting on her future parenting. I shouldn\u2019t have done that thank you for helping me understand that. \n\nI (25m) and girlfriend (24f) of 4 years have 2 dogs together. We got them while being together, neither have been from a previous relationship. My gf wakes up earlier than I do and works from home, so it makes the most sense, in my opinion, that she would take the dogs outside first thing in the morning as I do if I am up before her. But every single time without fail, she makes them wait for hours until they are crying and jumping at the door. Or sometimes just doesn\u2019t do it at all seemingly because she is waiting for me to do it. With the excuses \u201cthey didn\u2019t ask to go out yet. They\u2019ve just been playing with each other all morning. My boss needed me to do something right away.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve talked to her about this so many times, that the dogs are the first priority in the morning and that nothing else should really even be done until they go outside and do their business. She always responds with a huff and a puff and \u201cI know, I understand.\u201d I\u2019ve now started to tell her that what I\u2019m seeing from her towards the dogs makes me think she will do that with our future children. What if the baby needs a diaper change? Is she going to wait until shes had her coffee and breakfast before changing a dirty diaper from the night before? Or just leave it for as long as possible until I end up doing it? \n\nI\u2019ve seen her with kids and she is fantastic, she would make a great teacher but just this one thing is making me question how she would care for our own kids. Whenever I tell her I\u2019m worried that she is going to neglect our children in a way she gets upset and says she never would. But that is not what I am seeing from our 2 dogs that we consider to already be our children.

The point is, she is pawning a responsibility onto you that is something she should address as the person who needs to be up earlier in the morning.

If you had discussed getting the dogs together then she knew the responsibility of taking care of a dog. This sounds like it has clearly been an ongoing problem and she doesn\u2019t seem to care, either about your feeling towards it or the dogs well being. \nWhile yes working from home IS work, having to let 2 dogs out to pee before work is not crazy, and you are not asking for too much.

Even with training there's always cases of, \"I trusted them not to and they did it, it was so out of character for them.\" Their needs will always need to be met by their owners vs. a human child that typically matures out of this.\n\nIn effect your girlfriend is demonstrating that she's really only potentially good as a parent past the point of growing independence which is only a few steps removed from a parent that is emotionally distant until their child is, \"a full grown adult I can relate to\\~\"", "NTA\n\nIt's straight-up cruel to treat dogs like that, let them out for fuck's sake.", "ESH: Skip the whole motherhood thing. You have dogs now that are being mistreated. It's amazing they don't pee in the house. To have them whining and jumping at the door and she ignores them is inexcusable. It shows a lack of empathy.

I've never owned a pet but I know dogs need to be taken for a bathroom trip first thing in the morning, because I also need to pee when I wake up.  It's basic physiology.  All mammals have the same basic waste removal system.  If she continues to wait until the dogs are desperate to get out, it won't be long before they stop asking and just go right there in the home.\n\nYou're not wrong to be concerned about this pattern, but as much as pet owners love their kept animals, they're not children.  Your GF might be more responsible with her own offspring.  Or she might be the kind of mother that forgets her child at the grocery store.  There's unfortunately no way to know until it's too late.  So you'll need to decide for yourself if this is a deal breaker.  You've had 4 years to figure it out, but you're still young and have a lot of life left to live. \n\nIn any case, it seems rather mean to tell someone they'd be a poor parent.

The family member was older but had no physical limitations. They were perfectly able to make it out to lunch with friends or go to church regularly!

As he got older he went to sleep earlier so sometimes he would need to make super early so he woke me up.", "I\u2019m an animal person but it\u2019s completely reasonable that someone who\u2019s never owned a dog before might find out only after adopting a dog that they hate taking care of dogs. Still a living being that she and OP made a commitment to take care.", "How is what OP said harsh if what the GF is doing is cruel?", "Honestly, she probably doesn\u2019t care for the responsibility of pet ownership. How does she typically bond/interact with the dogs? Dogs can hold their urine in for about 6-8 hrs on average so the fact that they\u2019re begging to go out because they need to go that badly is just so cruel", "NTA. I think you really do need to think long and hard about having a child with her.", "I'd loathe having a dog. I like my toddler. I have a 2 y/o, 13 y/o, and a 17y/o - I've adored them at all ages.   I also have other much-loved creatures - dogs aren't really a litmus test for the ability to parent or care for another living thing. There some dog owners I absolutely would not trust with a human being and plenty of people who dislike dogs (or pets in general) and are good parents.", "It sounds like her demeanor towards animals/dogs are different than children. I personally don\u2019t enjoy being around dogs and try not to put myself around them. However when it comes to kids, I find my demeanor is much more warm and accepting. It seems like that\u2019s the case with OP\u2019s girlfriend.", "Like parenthood, the fur babies should be a shared responsibility. If she is up first then she should be taking them out. Or equally split. He takes the even days, she the odd. Or whatever. \n\nThey agreed to get the dogs together so it is up to both of them to care for the dogs.", "My mom's got a tiny lil morky and that thing will spitefully piss on anything my mom owns if she's even the slightest bit displeased about anything. And with friends/family who tells me dogs don't do that, I bring them round to show them firsthand how spiteful the lil beast is lmao", "NTA\n\nIt's straight-up cruel to treat dogs like that, let them out for fuck's sake.", "not everyone has a fenced in yard, bud", "me too...wake up, let the dog out while does his biz - the kitties and I head down to the bidet for our morning routine then I feed them all while I make my coffee/tea - every day, it's clockwork and effective.", "My oldest will straight up hold it for 16 hours if he can just stay in bed and be cozy. He's so lazy. I love him.", "Yeah, I don't get the Y - T - A judgement. If OP  is the asshole for tolerating the girlfriend's behavior, surely that's an ESH at the bare minimum?", "Did anyone say that WFH isn\u2019t work? My man works from home 2x a week and at the office the other 3 days. He takes the dog out every morning because he\u2019s up before I am. It\u2019s part of his AM routine regardless of where he\u2019s working for the day. Also, OP stated he works night shifts and as a result, he takes the dogs out the majority of the time during the day, including a lengthy walk right before his shift. \n\nIt\u2019s not at all asking for too much for his gf to take them out first thing in the morning if he\u2019s sleeping in due to working night shifts. Her common excuses are that the dogs were playing or didn\u2019t need to go out yet. Anyone who owns dogs knows that when they\u2019re up first thing in the morning, they\u2019ll need to go potty. OP\u2019s gf also acknowledges that the dogs are meant to go out first thing in the morning when he reminds her of this priority. If she was too busy with work, she\u2019d probably vocalize that, but it\u2019s reading like she\u2019s just being lazy and putting the task off because she knows if she doesn\u2019t do it, OP will.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more with this statement. I also loathe dogs and their dog behavior. However, I absolutely love being a mom to my now toddler. Even when she being naughty I\u2019d much rather deal with that over a dog, all day everyday. \n\nI know several people who have dogs and love them, but they have mean attitudes towards children and they are proof that kindness towards pets doesn\u2019t translate as kindness towards babies/children. \n\nNot everyone is built the same and dogs aren\u2019t the same as people. The potential to be a good owner towards an animal is never 100% truth to being a good parent to your kids.", "Then I sincerely hope you wouldn\u2019t agree to adopt two of them with your partner and then choose to neglect them in the morning while your partner who works nights is just trying to get some sleep. \n\nLoving or disliking an animal does not say a whole lot about how a person may parent. But neglecting a living being you chose to take care of? Red flag. \n\nI hate snakes. Absolutely terrified of them. If for some reason I made the dumbass decision to agree to watch one for somebody or worse adopt one with them, that thing will still be fed, given water, and the enclosure will be cleaned.", "Is she doing the care for the dogs or is she unable to because as you say she\u2019s at work the moment her eyes open each morning. \ud83d\ude44", "Walking a dog is  relaxing if you LIKE walking dogs. No amount of money would persuade to go out in the morning under the rain collecting dog poop.", "Lol some times it\u2019s worth holding it if you\u2019re comfortable with no responsibility \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 This is what it means to live.", "He says he works nights and dies the big long walk in the evening. Her doing a quick pee run seems fair", "They are their dogs. They researched and adopted together.", "Hmmm. I don\u2019t really agree. Struggling with infertility doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be the perfect parent, and we all deserve to be able to voice our concerns about our partner\u2019s parenting - not being free to do that is really dangerous. He wasn\u2019t nasty about it, the facts are pointing towards her behaviour being the same, and it\u2019s not okay. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s brutal to say that just because she\u2019s got fertility issues. She knows what she\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not news.", "Brutal but truthful and (imo) deserved. It\u2019s not even about liking the dogs, I\u2019m an animal person but it\u2019s completely reasonable that someone who\u2019s never owned a dog before might find out only after adopting a dog that they hate taking care of dogs. Still a living being that she and OP made a commitment to take care. I would be concerned for her empathy and ability to take care of others even if it was only a damn fish.", "Truth hurts sometimes \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I work from home and have for a decade. I\u2019m not immediately at work the moment I get up. I get up, responsibly walk both of my dogs so they don\u2019t have their bladders ready to explode, fix breakfast and then clock in. \n\nWFH is not an excuse to ignore the basic needs of a living creature.", "she may be \"responsible\" for them during the day while she's home, but i'd be **REALLY** curious to know how often she actually lets them out/walks them while OP is gone.\nit might be time to consider hiring a carer for the pups if you don't trust the partner \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nOP, NTA."]}
