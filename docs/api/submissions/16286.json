I did not realize how much information I had left out. We live in an apartment. I work nights and take the dogs for a 2 hour hike before my shift, so I sleep in a bit longer if I can. I am a horrible sleeper so I am usually up before her anyways. So because I am awake before her I am taking them out the majority of the time, but when I can sleep in they are not taken out until I am woken by the whining and I get up and ask if they\u2019ve been out yet and she says she was just about to do it. \n\nEDIT: I completely understand what you guys are saying about commenting on her future parenting. I shouldn\u2019t have done that thank you for helping me understand that. \n\nI (25m) and girlfriend (24f) of 4 years have 2 dogs together. We got them while being together, neither have been from a previous relationship. My gf wakes up earlier than I do and works from home, so it makes the most sense, in my opinion, that she would take the dogs outside first thing in the morning as I do if I am up before her. But every single time without fail, she makes them wait for hours until they are crying and jumping at the door. Or sometimes just doesn\u2019t do it at all seemingly because she is waiting for me to do it. With the excuses \u201cthey didn\u2019t ask to go out yet. They\u2019ve just been playing with each other all morning. My boss needed me to do something right away.\u201d \n\nI\u2019ve talked to her about this so many times, that the dogs are the first priority in the morning and that nothing else should really even be done until they go outside and do their business. She always responds with a huff and a puff and \u201cI know, I understand.\u201d I\u2019ve now started to tell her that what I\u2019m seeing from her towards the dogs makes me think she will do that with our future children. What if the baby needs a diaper change? Is she going to wait until shes had her coffee and breakfast before changing a dirty diaper from the night before? Or just leave it for as long as possible until I end up doing it? \n\nI\u2019ve seen her with kids and she is fantastic, she would make a great teacher but just this one thing is making me question how she would care for our own kids. Whenever I tell her I\u2019m worried that she is going to neglect our children in a way she gets upset and says she never would. But that is not what I am seeing from our 2 dogs that we consider to already be our children.

The point is, she is pawning a responsibility onto you that is something she should address as the person who needs to be up earlier in the morning. I don't understand why this seems such a burden to her, but your dogs certainly are burdened until some nice human decides to open the door!

If you had discussed getting the dogs together then she knew the responsibility of taking care of a dog. This sounds like it has clearly been an ongoing problem and she doesn\u2019t seem to care, either about your feeling towards it or the dogs well being. \nWhile yes working from home IS work, having to let 2 dogs out to pee before work is not crazy, and you are not asking for too much.

Even with training there's always cases of, \"I trusted them not to and they did it, it was so out of character for them.\" Their needs will always need to be met by their owners vs. a human child that typically matures out of this.\n\nIn effect your girlfriend is demonstrating that she's really only potentially good as a parent past the point of growing independence which is only a few steps removed from a parent that is emotionally distant until their child is, \"a full grown adult I can relate to\\~\"", "NTA\n\nIt's straight-up cruel to treat dogs like that, let them out for fuck's sake.", "ESH: Skip the whole motherhood thing. You have dogs now that are being mistreated. It's amazing they don't pee in the house. To have them whining and jumping at the door and she ignores them is inexcusable. It shows a lack of empathy.

I've never owned a pet but I know dogs need to be taken for a bathroom trip first thing in the morning, because I also need to pee when I wake up.  It's basic physiology.  All mammals have the same basic waste removal system.  If she continues to wait until the dogs are desperate to get out, it won't be long before they stop asking and just go right there in the home.\n\nYou're not wrong to be concerned about this pattern, but as much as pet owners love their kept animals, they're not children.  Your GF might be more responsible with her own offspring.  Or she might be the kind of mother that forgets her child at the grocery store.  There's unfortunately no way to know until it's too late.  So you'll need to decide for yourself if this is a deal breaker.  You've had 4 years to figure it out, but you're still young and have a lot of life left to live. \n\nIn any case, it seems rather mean to tell someone they'd be a poor parent.

The family member was older but had no physical limitations. They were perfectly able to make it out to lunch with friends or go to church regularly!

It sounds like OP loves these dogs and has bonds with them. She can't dictate removing them from their lives because she's too damn lazy and self-centered to care for a creature that needs to be walked outside once every few hours. If she can get her ass up and go pee herself, or make herself food, or go out to get groceries for herself, she can bring a dog downstairs to pee.\n\nA lot of dog owners would never, ever EVER rehome their animals. I myself would move house, break up with an SO, even live out of my car until I found a place that accepted my animals. Hell, I've used the little money I've had left to buy my puppy food before feeding myself. I'd gone 2 days without food myself, but you bet my puppy had the best damn kibble on the market.\n\nMind you, I've worked with kids for nearly 20 years. I love kids, love seeing how I impact their lives, love watching them learn and grow, seeing how proud they are of themselves and how proud their parents are of them. I'd protect them with my life if I had to. But I never want one of my own, I'd hate motherhood in that way. I'd rather be able to hand them back after 8-12 hours of seeing them during my work hours than raising one, even if I know I'd be good at it."]}
