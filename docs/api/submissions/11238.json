I live in the UK of whom, I barely know anyone who actually plays it. For some context, I had around 30 legendary Pok\u00e9mon, keep this in mind as this story continues.\n\nI recall walking down a relatively quiet street when the events of this story unfolded. I sat down on a bench to have a quick sip of my coffee when I noticed a mother and her son walking down the street both holding phones and using finger gestures that are similar to what I do. When she noticed that I was looking in her direction she quickly hustled her child and herself over to me where she asked:\n\u201cDo you play this Pok\u00e9mon go game?\u201d.\n\nI remember tilting my head in curiosity and saying \u201cyes\u201d,  before she requested that I show her my legendary Pok\u00e9mon collection. For some clarification, legendary Pok\u00e9mon for me are really hard to obtain and this collection of mine has tooken me more than 6 months to acquire most of the 30 and counting legendary Pok\u00e9mon. When I showed her my collection I remember her asking her son which one to pick before he picked the most powerful legendary I had ( for anyone wondering what Pok\u00e9mon it was, it was a Dialga). Before she had time to ask I asked what he would be trading for it before she uttered the words which made me immediately say no.\n\n\u201cWell you already have 30 why can\u2019t you let my son have one for free?!\u201d\n\nI almost began laughing and then saying absolutely not, her son began to shed tears before she said \u201clook at what you have done\u201d. Mind you, she hadn\u2019t even offered to pay me of which I would of refused anyways as I believe it is against Pokemon go\u2019s founders TOS to buy or exchange Pok\u00e9mon outside of the game that require you to buy or exchange money. She then began demanding that I give her son a legendary Pok\u00e9mon calling me \u201ca spoiled greedy brat who can\u2019t share.\u201d, I decided to ignore them, so I picked my bag up from the ground and began walking, last thing I remember was turning around to seeing the mother comforting her child. \n\nI got home and began writing this, on one side of me I almost feel bad for the kid, for not giving him something that would of probably made his day, but on the other side I remember thinking, that they are mine and she didn\u2019t even offer anything in return. (I do legendary for legendary offers as that\u2019s what\u2019s best for me and the other person I am trading with).

She is definitely raising her son to expect a complete stranger to give him things he has not earned. She can catch her own legendary and give it to him. I really can't believe someone would expect this from a stranger.", "NTA 100%.\n\nMother and son are both entitled bratty AHs.\n\nI'd only think of trading a legendary for a \"whatever\" Pok\u00e9mon if it was one of my IRL friends... or if it was like a lucky trade for something like a shiny I really wanted...\n\nAs far as a literal stranger coming up and asking for/demanding a legendary, I'd at least like a legendary or something worth using my special trade of the day for it to be worth my time. Especially because it'll cost a ton of stardust to trade a legendary that someone doesn't have with a new PoGO friend.", "NTA. \nI play Pok\u00e9mon go and I know how trades work. Does she even know how much stardust it would have cost to trade that Dialga? She\u2019s insane.", "\"Look you have 5 of those \u00a310 bills in your wallet.

You have no obligation to give away Pok\u00e9mon that you have obtained, regardless of how you got them or their status. The fact that a grown woman would expect this from you is honestly just baffling on her part.", "Nta I wouldn't even have enough stardust to trade with some literal rando off the street. It's like a million dust to do!  Even if you're best friends it's still, what, 40k dust?

How rude and ill mannered!!\"\n\nThey'll bluster just as much because they're entitled but perhaps they'll learn.", "haha, I am so sorry but I found this amusing. I have also played Pokemon Go and I didn't think you could gift someone a pokemon... I thought it had to be a trade? I wouldv'e done the same thing and I'm a 36 year old mother. Legendaries are HARD to get. Its best to earn them. You did nothing wrong kid.", "NTA.\n\nOp i can almost guarantee that you are not the first person they tried this stunt on.\n\n- she asked about legendary pokemon from the jump. That was her fishing to see if you had any \n\n- she asks her son to \"pick one\" without asking if you'd be willing to trade. Also you're a stranger, game in common means nothing. \n\n- pretty sure there was an event on which means they were deliberately out looking for ppl to run this game on and you happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time so to speak\n\n-instant waterworks when you said no.\n\n-unwilling to offer anything in trade an felt entitled to your pokemon\n\nSo no you are not TA. Also if you've got any local go groups online you can reach out to see if anyone else has been approached by this woman.", "NTA.  The mom has issues.", "NTA- I don't see why she feels entitled to things you've collected in a game.", "Strangers walking up to *demand* things from another person are rude.  I don't care what their motivations are.  Rude.  They don't even deserve a minute of your time. NTA", "**NTA.**\n\nEntitlement sucks. This mother is only harming her child. If Mom doesn't get her parenting in gear this kid is going to have a rough childhood.", "NTA. Poor kid, the mother doesn't do any favours to him by being so absurd with her demands. Why would you,  a random stranger, be obligated to give him a legendary? If he wants them, he can start raiding!", "NTA", "NTA. I only have a passing acquaintance with PoGo but I do know that a stranger demanding you give them something because reasons isn't how the world works.", "Wow, what an entitled mother teaching her kid to be an entitled brat.\nNTA.\nThis was so presumptuous.", "NTA.\n\nThe didn't even ASK, she just ASSUMED you would give her kids a pokemon just because you happen to also play? THAT is entitled, and she's raising her kid to be entitled.", "NTA. But you\u2019re too young to be drinking coffee.", "38 year old mom here, that woman is entitled as hell. If she actually gave half a shit she could catch him legendarys herself. I go to a bunch of raids for my kids while they're in school if they really want something or we go on Pokewalks in the parks in our town. She could absolutely be using this as a bonding experience, I imagine the rest of her parenting is just as lazy.", "Definitely NTA. Why she thought she or her kid were entitled to your pokemon is ridiculous. Also, i don\u2019t think you can just give one over so easily in game. You\u2019ve gotta be friends and interact for a long while before it even allows you to do special trades (unless it changed)", "This is written really strangely.", "NTA but\n\nWhy are you drinking coffee at 14?", "nta you should cross post this to entitled parents they would get a good chuckle from this", "NTA. She had no right to demand you give her son your Pok\u00e9mon.", "NTA.  Not your fault the mom is an AH who thinks she can just give her kid other people's things.\n\n(And unless you were able to see otherwise, I bet this kid has a bunch of legendaries scammed off of other randos in the exact same way)", "NTA", "Nta. Find this monster and sue her into the stone age.", "NTA, her son\u2019s a brat", "Ah, Pokemon Go, an area of personal expertise.\n\nNTA, for a few reasons. That kid is not entitled to other peoples' Pokemon just because he wants them. If she had been nice, you could have told her about Poke Genie so she could do raids from around the world, but walking away was the best course of action since she was so entitled and awful. At any rate, trading a legendary Pokemon costs like 2mil stardust on each side if the player you're trading to doesn't have it and you're brand new friends, so it may have been impossible anyway.", "NTA. Just like respect, a legendary pokemon must be earned.", "I don't understand why you showed her your Pok\u00e9mon collection, IMO it was unnecessary and only made her believe she had some sort of right to demand you gave her kid something however still NTA, you don't have to trade your Pok\u00e9mon to her just because she thinks you have to spare.", "NTA.\n\nWTF if she said give them all to my child for free just because\u2026 and your phone too because it\u2019s better!", "That would have been my go to- \"I'd love to but I don't have enough of the stardust you need to trade. Sorry, have a good one!\" And nope out", "Right?! That was my first thought.   If it wasn't for the dust requirements I would give away all my extra shiny and legendary (I'm a one and one kind of person)", "Couldn't have even traded right away anyways. You have to be 'best friends\" to trade legendaries. Which takes a full 30 days of sending gifts to each other. If I remember right.", "Curious if you used ChatGBT for this.  Just trying to get a feel for the cadence and work usage.", "My thoughts exactly", "The vocabulary and length of the post is certainly very unusual for a 14yo. Sounds more like copy pasta.", "Oh yeah. That would be a good one", "You don't need to be best friends, it just requires way less stardust if you are. Either way it's an unreasonable ask though since I think it's 1,000,000 stardust for new friends.", "I disagree.  This is something I could have written at 14, with the exception of \"have tooken\" and \"would of\".\n\nPeople who read a lot really do have this kind of vocabulary. The writer is very literal and relating the event in their head, and obviously has a lot of words without a complete grasp of grammer pitfalls.", "I couldn't remember the exact requirements, either way, it couldn't have been done right there in the spot, pretty sure you have to wait at least one day."]}
