Instead of just apologizing and trying to do better, he turned it around to him needing comfort for engaging in bad behavior, derailing the actual argument. \n\nThere was another post yesterday about a girl who likes name calling her love ones as her \"love language\" (Calling him idiot and stupid, etc.) even when he told her to stop and that it HURT him. And she wouldn't stop, so he broke up with her. Because he realized she liked hurting his feelings more than she liked him.\n\nAt the end of the day, it shouldn't be HARD to stop hurting someone, even if it takes some effort to break a habit. If someone both loves AND respects you, not wanting to hurt you for fun should be a given. \n\nPlease remember that it is possible to truly love someone without actually respecting them as a person as an equal that deserves good things. It's how we end up with abusive relationships. Even if he LOVES you, if he doesn't respect you enough to want to stop something that hurts you just because it's fun for him, well... why would you want that?\n\nYou deserve better than that, OP. Always value respect over love if you have to choose just one.

This guy has control issues, and anger issues too. He doesn't sound safe to be around, tbh.", "Personally I think taking anything that's potentially going to impair your movements or reaction time when using heavy machines is dumb - and in an environment where someone else could be hurt by your actions it's just selfish. If OP had said they'd had a beer or glass of wine before hitting the gym, would that be acceptable to you too?", "Absolutely would be, yes. Provided OP drinks once in a while and isn't smashed off their ass. I wouldn't be comfortable spotting someone bench pressing 250lbs when I'm a lil off but I don't really see it as a risky behavior either for example if OPs doing stationary bike or yoga. It's really a case by case basis. Plus a lot of people are clumsy and slow naturally and they're allowed to use gym equipments, I see it in a similar way.\n\nObv not saying you should show up to your neighborhood gym shrooming off your ass but ya know, I don't see it as reckless either.", "You realise you're a walking health and safety hazard right?"]}
