He sounds exhausting, controlling, suffocating, manipulative and weird. His reaction to you just wanting a few minutes to yourself is very alarming. Please think about what everyone is telling you!", "NTA.  OP, please listen to the comments.  Just think about what is happening here.  Your boyfriend's idea of \"bonding\" is a joint work-out session in which he is in complete control, tells you exactly what to do, and \"scolds\" you to the point that it becomes stressful for you.  When you decide that you want to do just ONE activity by yourself (run on the treadmill),he goes completely nuclear and assumes that you want to break up, over you getting to choose just one activity that isn't completely dominated by him.  Then, when he \"apologizes\" (then revokes his apology?) he makes excuses, and claims that he enjoys confusing you through mind puzzles.  \n\nPlease know, this is NOT normal.  This is NOT how a relationship is supposed to work.  Your SO is not supposed to play mind games with you, that is a completely disturbing thing to say.  Your SO should not control your every action while you are together, and throw a fit when you show the slightest bit of independence.  I think he's obviously worn you down if you \"feel like a jerk\" after this incident, and especially if you think he scolds you and talks down to you \"out of love.\"  Please ask yourself, does he do this in other aspects of the relationship outside of the gym?  Do you actually enjoy it when he \"confuses you with mind puzzles,\" and do you think that's something a loving partner would do?", "He enjoys purposefully confusing me through mind puzzles.\n\nRead that.

He can say he never admitted to guilt because he did nothing wrong *or* he can claim he already apologized for the event, so you're \"over reacting\" if you try to bring it up again. \n\nRed flag number 6: Based on your comments, he goes back and forth between saying he does things \"as a joke\" or that he does things \"unintentionally.\" For one, neither of these is a good excuse on their own. Moreover, if either were true, he wouldn't have to go back and forth like this. \n\nRed flag number 7: You now feel guilty over something *he* did wrong.
