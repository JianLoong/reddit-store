I was planning to ho I even went shopping for a dress (which's hard to do due to grief but I kept it together). \n\nLast night we were at her house and I excused myself to the bathroom while she and my husband and his dad were talking. I came back and heard her ask \"why I didn't turn her Thanksgiving invitation down\". I was puzzled I decided to stop and listen more. My husband said that \"it was her fault\" she invited me, but she said that she did it \"out of courtesy\" and that she didn't \"think\" I'd accept the invite. She said that now I'll \"potentially\" ruine the celebration with my \"negative vibe\" and will make things \"awkward\" for everybody because of my brother's passing. I was stunned. My husband replied saying that I do tend to get emotional usually now it's \"worse\" that there's death in the family. I was so upset I didn't know wether I shoukd go home or pretend to not have heard this. I stayed quiet til we went home. There I told him I won't be going to spend thanksgiving with his mother and family. He asked why and started pressuring me to talk. I told him about the conversation he had with MIL and he got upset and accused me of stirring drama by snooping and evasdropping on conversations that I wasn't part of. We got into a massive argument about it and he kept saying that I was being too senstive and unreasonable.\n\n\nHis mom tried to call then texted about me not hearing their conversation properly and that there is a huge misunderstanding.

I wouldn't go either and shame on your husband for not having your back during that conversation. I mean, your brother just passed away a month ago. Of course, you are not going to be filled with joy and bubbly over the holidays.

Holidays are always hard for people who have suffered loss. \n\nGrief doesn't go away and it affects everyone differently and it sure as hell doesn't get better after only one month.   \n\n\nYour husband's family sound like cold insensitive assholes, and frankly it seems your husband may be cut of the same cloth by talking about you behind your back like that.   \n\n\nHE is the one being unreasonable and a prick to boot.   \n\n\nI'm very sorry for your loss OP.", "NTA-You are not being sensitive or unreasonable and when the conversation is about you, you are part of it.

Your MIL and husband are both gaslighting you.  You heard what you heard, and you did nothing wrong by hearing a conversation in a home you were invited to, where everyone knew you were present.  \"You're too sensitive\" is the bully's defense.\n\nAs a show of maturity and decency, you could let MIL explain what the misunderstanding is, if you feel you're strong enough to stand your ground and not accept any BS from her.  But you're under no obligation to do so.  And I note that MIL is claiming misunderstanding, not leading with an apology, which is definitely in order.", "NTA. Can you maybe spend the day with your own family and not your in-laws?

Family, whether by birth, marriage or other, should be there to support and lift up their loved ones when they are going through a tough time, especially during the holidays.\n\nPlease take care of yourself right now and don\u2019t worry about your husband or MILs feelings.  They don\u2019t seem worth your time or energy.", "NTA. First of all I am SO sorry for your loss. Lots of hugs. Second of all get away from this family! I would understand if it\u2019s just the MIL but it\u2019s the fact that your own husband couldn\u2019t back you up too? He doesn\u2019t sound supportive at all. You were damned if you went and damned if you didn\u2019t. That was a lose lose situation. It sounds like a win win situation would be you divorcing your husband because he doesn\u2019t sound good for you at all at this point and he doesn\u2019t have to be with a human being because he obviously doesn\u2019t know how to have a relationship with one which is also a win.\n\nWhen I first started dating my boyfriend his dog died and I dropped everything and was there for him for months until he felt better and the grief had passed. Never once did I make him feel like he was being a burden (which he never was) and never once did I make him seem like his grief was a problem (because again it isn\u2019t. It is a human reaction to something bad that has happened that can not be changed). I bet it is a lot worse for something as unexpected and tragic as what you are going through now and your husband didn\u2019t have any empathy or sympathy for you at all.", "NTA but wow! What happened to \"for better or worse\" wow! Your husband is such an insensitive prick and hearing your MIL, I see where he gets it from. \n\nIs there any family (NOT his!) Where you can go? Please do not think you're too sensitive, you are grieving and if they do not understand that then it makes me wonder what else they criticize you for that is completely reasonable.", "NTA. \n\nId tell her to fu*k off. And that you aren't coming to thanksgiving because of her selfish and cruel attitude NOT because your brother died. I would not go near those people. They can rack off. \n\nHow DARE she and your husband make such harsh & awful judgements about you? They are appalling.\n\nI wouldn't get emotional about it.\nFrankly? I'd ask my husband to leave and give me space. Let him run to mummy.\n\nA decent man would defend you and shut her down. The fact he didn't? Is worrying. And then to gaslight you by turning it around and saying its your fault for listening!!  He is disgraceful.\n\nYep.... Me? I'd be kicking him out. A month after your brothers death and 1. They seem to expect you should be over it! 2. Then they are accusing you of being emotional!! Ffaacckk .. your 19 year old brother was killed! Of course you're in an emotional state! 3. They care more about fuc*king Thanksgiving then you 4. He didn't even aplogise, admit his conversation with his mother was inappropriate and downright cruel.\n\nHe needs a reality check. He needs to think of his priorities. And YOU should be his priority. Not mummy and Thanksgiving\ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd2c\ud83e\udd2c", "What in the world! I am so sorry for your loss, first off. But they are all assholes (obviously). \n\nThe MIL is manipulating and gaslighting you at an incredibly vulnerable time for you, to think that what you heard is incorrect and your own husband - the one who has seen you lose your brother, witnessed your (very valid) grieve and now has the audacity to turn the blame to YOU because how dare you be too emotional and make a dramatic situation out of the death of your brother. \n\nI am not going to say you need to dump that family, but you need to seriously think about how uncomfortable they are simply by your grieving. Instead of comforting you in a devastating time and making things easier for you, having compassion and empathy, they\u2019ve decided to do the opposite. They are emotionally inept and I dare say this is the first blaring red flag you\u2019ve seen.\n\nAlso, the fact the MIL is trying to change the script in your head because you weren\u2019t supposed to hear what she said is pitiful. She obviously doesn\u2019t want you to think lowly of her, but that ship has sailed. Integrity is what we do when no one is looking (or hearing) and this family has no integrity. \n\nI hope you find the support you deserve in this horrific time. I cannot imagine the grief you are experiencing, and this now has just made it all so so much worse. Good luck x", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour husband isn't a good husband, or a good friend. \n\nNow you know how they think of you. Thats why he's mad. He wants you to feel even worse instead of taking responsibility for his part in the conversation.\n\nThey clearly don't care about you, at all. I Wouldn't attend any if their gatherings going forward. You don't need to be around people who think so little of you.", "NTA\n\nA) when people are speaking loudly enough, about you, you have the right to listen. It\u2019s not like using the bathroom takes longer than the conversation they were having. \n\nB) Your husband not being sympathetic about your grieving is a huge red flag, and is definitely something you two need to discuss privately. He must have forgotten \u2018For better or for worse\u2019 and needs one hell of a reminder. \n\nC) Your MIL should be more sympathetic of her grieving DIL. How dare she talk about your \u2018negative vibe\u2019. Ask her how she would expect her son to feel if their sibling died suddenly. She needs a reality check. \n\nAfter the holidays you should really have a discussion to both people about how their words and actions made you feel (even though they should know already). It might be a better idea to spend this holiday with your family, where you can openly grieve. \n\nMy condolences.", "NTA. I lost my brother 20 years ago on the day before Thanksgiving. I am so sorry for your loss. Your husband needs some human empathy for his grieving wife. So does his mother. The way they\u2019re treating you is disgusting.", "NTA grief is a reason for someone to be emotional and sensitive and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! The biggest ah here is your husband who\u2019s supposed to love and support you through all the tough times. Instead he badmouthed to his parents and then had the gall to blame you for eavesdropping!? Op please give some serious consideration to what else does he gaslight you about.", "*NTA You just lost your brother a month ago!

Your in laws clearly have no interest in that being their \u201cvibe\u201d this holiday season.  They don\u2019t want people to question why you are missing because they\u2019re afraid people will find out how insensitive they\u2019re being to you and your loss.

You deserve so much love and support right now and clearly your husband is the real AH in all this. Sometimes people find grief awkward and don't handle it well. That seems like your husband and his family. If you have the ability to be with parents, a sibling or a friend during the holidays where you can grieve peacefully I think that would be best. Also, refrain from speaking with your MIL right now. Nothing good will come from that conversation right now. Focus on yourself.", "NTA I'm just so sorry for your loss.
