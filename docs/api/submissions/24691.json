That's no bueno.\n\nIncidentally, your friend is an AH too, for violating YOUR trust.", "YTA. It was never yours to give away. Everyone else in your family respected your grandma enough to not do what you did. You think \u2018it\u2019s just a recipe\u2019 but to your grandmother, it\u2019s obviously more than that. You\u2019re not wrong for cooking it for your friend, that was a nice gesture. When she asked for the recipe, you could\u2019ve said it was your grandmas and didn\u2019t feel as though you could give it. Your friend wouldn\u2019t have cared if you said that because she was happy regardless. You were well-intentioned but it wasn\u2019t your recipe to give away.", "YTA. You spilled someone else\u2019s secret. You knew it was a special secret to your grandma and you gave it away anyway. Once you accept someone\u2019s secret, you need to honor it.  I think secret recipes are weird, but your grandmother doesn\u2019t. \n\nPlus, you gave it to someone who cares about fake internet points more than trouble she caused with your family.", "It wasn't your secret to share. YTA.", "YTA, you could have just said you made it up as you went so didn't have a recipe to share and no harm done. While it is \"just a recipe\" these things are important to some people. You'd already cheered your friend up by cooking for them.", "YTA . \n\nif you knew ur granma doesnt wanna share her recipe , then u dont have any right to share that . just as if someone shared any secret with u and u are expected to guard that. u disrespected ur family . u could have cook for ur friend , u didnt have to share the recipe", ">and she's very protective of it.\n\nThis is where I stopped reading.

If you thought it would be ok - you would not  have specifically told your friend to keep it quiet. \n\nAlso, downplaying what you did by saying \u201cit was just a recipe\u201d probably isn\u2019t doing you any favors. \n\nYou betrayed your grandma, live with the consequences.", "YTA.

You can't disregard it by saying it's just a recipe when clearly it's invaluable to your family.

Unless you use it for your livelihood. And it's not like you gave it away willy nilly. You shared it with a close friend. Friends are like family. Your friend was definitely being dicey by making that social media post when they knew it was supposed to be secret. But they're going through a hard time. The fact that your family is prioritizing a recipe over you, an actual human being family member, is sad and stupid. And again, you shared it out of love for a grieving friend. It's not like you sold it or something. If Grandma needs the recipe to be that secret, you shouldn't have even known what it was in the first place. I love sharing family recipes with people. That's what life is all about. It's ingredients not medical information.", "Wow a lotta bing bongs in the comments riding hard for \u201csecret family recipes\u201d - as someone else mentioned, it\u2019s not like you took the recipe away from your family. They can still enjoy it and pass it on. It\u2019s still your family recipe. Lotta real silly people in this world believe their grandma has a trick for making tomato sauce that no one else has ever considered.", "ESH\n\nYou shared a family secret. (You could have just made her a big batch and canned/frozen it in small portions.)\n\nYour friend broke her promise to keep it secret. \n\nYour family is being overdramatic over a recipe.\n\n-----\n\nPersonally, I think \"secret family recipes\" are rather dumb. Food that tastes good should be shared with the rest of the world. Not to mention with all the problems with allergies these days, people **need** to know what's in their food.", "YTA, but I just don't think you could have known any better.\n\nTruth be told, things like this mean much more to older generations than they do the younger ones. I understand why you did what you did, and I don't really blame you. I don't think it was really possible for you to understand the ramifications, but in the end, a secret is a secret for a reason.\n\nYour friend sucks, btw. Loose lips sink ships.", "NTA and your family are way over the top with their reaction. Who knows if your friend's will taste the same as your grandma's. No one should get so weird over a list of ingredients. Just my opinion.", "The keyword here is \"secret\". Soft YTA.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure the recipe is nothing special, in fact, and your family should get over it. It\u2019s not like you shared a trade secret that will ruin your family business. You did a nice thing for your friend, she did a shitty thing by sharing it, tell your family to grow up.", "I don\u2019t understand the thing with secret recipes, and think it\u2019s stupid. Does their food suddenly start tasting bad if someone else is using the recipe? So, I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a big thing sharing it with your friend, and it was your best friend not just anyone.\n\nHowever you did promise to not share the recipe (I assume) but did anyway which makes you slightly TA. However your family seems to really blow this out of proportion by not inviting you and stop trusting you - I mean it\u2019s just a fkn recipe. \n\nSo ESH but more so your family than you.", "NTA - I\u2019m sure the recipe is nothing special, in fact, and your family should get over it. It\u2019s not like you shared a trade secret that will ruin your family business. You did a nice thing for your friend, she did a shitty thing by sharing it, tell your family to grow up.", "YTA there are so many other ways you could have cheered your friend up. You knew it was wrong to share because you told your friend to keep it a secret. I know some people don't like the the idea of keeping recipes secret but your grandmother obviously thought this was something special for your family and you just gave it out because your friend was feeling down. You showed no regard for your family's wishes.", "NTA", "YTA", "YTA. nothing wrong with cooking for her, however you broke your families trust. is there any way you can UNtell her the recipe? delete the text, burn the paper, etc? might go some way to absolution", "YTA", "I'll need to see that recipe in order to make an accurate assessment.", "YTA - you had no right to share it for any reason.  \nNot even to make your friend feel better.  \nYou already made her the dish.  \nSo by making her feel better you\u2019ve hurt your entire family  \nWell done. \nI hope to feel good about yourself", "I agree the level of drama over a recipe is ridiculous, but you knew that your family, especially your grandmother, was weird about it and you chose to share it anyway. And your 'suffering' friend isn't much of one if she immediately shared it after being asked not to. ESH", "YTA for sharing something personal. Yes, it\u2019s just a recipe. But if you remove the physical thing, what is it about?\n\nYou have had something for generations. It is passed down through family members and has been protected. Isn\u2019t it cool to know something generations of your family did and probably worked on improvements? It started as some sauce, then someone added this, someone further down the line added that. And what you end up with is the memory of the past generations. Something physical. Something you can keep remaking and add a bit of yourself for the next generations. And instead of acknowledging that this is what you have, that it actually got passed down generations, you shit on your grandparents legacy and then make a surprise pikachu face when they are upset. \n\nYou are not disinvited over a recipe. You might not even be disinvited over sharing the recipe. But over your rude reaction after seeing your family got hurt and saying it\u2019s just a recipe. How about next time you try \u201cI am so sorry, I didn\u2019t realize this would be so upsetting. I know I cannot take it back, but what can I do to earn your trust again?\u201d\n\nAlso guessing how quickly it got your friend to share that she knows the recipe it is safe to say if she hasn\u2019t shared it with others, she will soon. I don\u2019t think you will have to worry about such situations in the future, since you will most likely be left out of stuff they consider important. But hey, in your mind they are stupid anyways, right?", "YTA, but a good intentioned one. A lot of people saying they don\u2019t know that the big deal is about family recipes (honestly, I agree) but what you and I and they think about the tradition doesn\u2019t matter here. It mattered to your family and you betrayed that trust. You should have just told your friend that it\u2019s a family recipe and you are sworn to secrecy. Your friend sucks at discretion, holy shit what a rookie move. \n\nYou should definitely apologize to your grandmother and DO NOT mention anything about not thinking it was a big deal\u2026you already knew that it was to her so leave the justifying out of it.", "NTA I never understood this need of secrecy over food recipes. Whenever someone tells me they love something I\u2019ve cooked I\u2019m more than happy to share the recipe. Most of the times it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve found on-line, anyway.", "NTA. \n\nThe truth about family recipes is that they are neither secret or special. And it isn't even grandma's original recipe. It has been handed down multiple times over the years to the point that you and others in your generation know it. At this point it belongs to all of you to do with it what you wish. \n\nAnd again, unless there is some ingredient that your family discovered and only your family has access to, it is likely a recipe used by thousands of people, and a lot of them probably believe it is their secret family recipe.", "NTA. To me a best friend is part of the family. Food should be about sharing, love and togetherness. I personally don't get gate keeping recipies unless they are patented or something. \n\nI feel your family is over-reacting. I have some signature recipes and I am always happy to share. It's flattering if someone likes your food that much. When I'm a grandma, all my grandkids' friends will be part of my family. I plan to cook for everyone and share my recipies. One day I'll be gone and the more people who remember me through my signature crepes/lemon chicken/bbq rub, etc. the better. OP's family needs to chill a bit.\n\nLet the down votes come lol!", "Unpopular but NTA...  I'm guessing the recipe is similar to ragu or prego but a small difference.  Yiur family sounds like a darn cult, be happy you aren't invited anymore,  do they sacrifice animals at these dinners, too???", "Yeah YTA. It's been said enough times but to reiterate, it was never your secret to share, and your penchant for oversharing just to feel like you're helping has this time bit you in the butt - learn from it, never do more than is necessary.\n\nI'm sure your family will cool off after a while, but you need to seriously reflect and actually accept that you have hurt them, especially your grandmother, and apologise for what you did.\n\nI wouldn't let your friend off the hook either, you specifically told her to keep quiet about it and she couldn't even do that, and now you're in hot water because she has just as big a knack for oversharing as you do.\n\nAlso, not sure why it's relevant for some people to share their negative views on 'secret recipes' - it's a family tradition, namely a tradition that has nothing to do with them, so not like their opinion actually matters on how valid it is, because it's valid for that family and that's what matters.", "YTA. We get to spend so little of our lives with our grandparents, and hurting your grandmother like that was a really crummy thing to do.", "I'm going to go with NTA. And I'm going to need this recipe.", "NTA - I can't believe such a hyper-overreaction to some extra salt and pepper.\n\nIngredients aren't your families legacy, you and the rest of your family are. Its petty imo.", "YTA", "YTA. It wasn't yours to share.", "NTA - but, you are to your family, so apologizing without saying anything along the lines of \"it's just a recipe\" is mandatory (if you want to be forgiven, that is). Tell your grandmother (and maybe your whole family), that you didn't realize just how significant this would be for her, you were just so focused on comforting your grieving friend, you made a mistake without thinking it through, but you are deeply sorry for hurting her. It might seem silly (I've never understood the whole secret recipe thing), but it's clearly a big deal to her, and to your family as a whole, so treating it with gravity and acknowledging how serious of an offense it is to them will likely be necessary for them to believe you are truly sorry.", "Yta, I'm sorry but next time just make it for them but don't tell them the recipe. I'd at least tell Grandma why you did it, don't let anyone elze interrupt, etc. And make sure the friend is respectful on not telling anyone. Now that she has it she can easily post it anywhere she wants and even claim it.  It saying she would, but it's always a possibility, especially if the friendship ends in a any sort of way.", "YTA. You disrespected your grandmother and your family all for the sake of a friend who has no respect for you and cares more about internet clout than respecting your confidence. \n\nYour poor Grandmother knowing her grandchild has zero respect or concern for her or the family or the family history. Of course you\u2019re uninvited. \u201cJust a recipe\u201d my god you\u2019re an ass.", "Ofcourse YTA. How could you think you are not?", "YTA-the recipe wasn\u2019t yours to share.", "Yta", "Um, yup. YTA.", "A list of ingredients isn't a recipe, for the record.", "She was the loose lips bro", "I alway thought recipes should be shared", "Yeha I'm sorry but you kinda stink. Its special to them, you can find so many variations online, their specific one doesn't need to be shared for people like you to fully enjoy pasta.", "Well it\u2019s pasta sauce so it might as well be a recipe.", "I don't think that matters, it's as special to them and you can easily find so many variations online. You sont need this one secret family recipe", "Lol, I get they feel that way. I just prefer sharing the love.", "Not at all. The trick to my pasta sauce (I'm not calling it a \"secret\" because I'll tell anyone who asks lol) is entirely in the method - fry the spices/herbs, add a bit of tomato to make a \"roux\", cook that, then add the rest of the tomato. It hugely improved the flavour without changing the ingredients at all.", "And was the love spread in this situation? Because pretty sure OP isn\u2019t feeling the love from her family, nor is the family feeling any love from OP. I\u2019m like you and all for sharing recipes, but it\u2019s very clear this recipe was a secret and not OPs secret to share. And then OPs friend bragged about it on social media after being specifically asked not to.", "SOOOOO much this. There are several \"family\" recipes that, by just looking at the ingredients list, you wouldn't think were any different from something you buy off the shelf at the grocery store.\n\nIn fact, I just checked about 10 different recipes for thing X on the internet, and they're all missing like 3 steps that bring out some great flavor and creaminess.\n\nI will never give up the recipe for thing X."]}
