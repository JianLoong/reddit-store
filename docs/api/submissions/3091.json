She's experiencing art VOLUNTARILY. \n\nAgreed, she shouldn't be skipping school and damaging her academic work to do so. But banning her from galleries is going to: a) make her resent you; b) not make her feel better about school; c) potentially damage her love of art, which is a GOOD THING. \n\nInstead of this, why not work a deal with her, for heaven's sake? \"If you have a semester without a single missed class, I will take you to INSERT MAJOR GALLERY HERE WITHIN YOUR BUDGET for a weekend of unbridled art viewing. If you get straight As, I'll try to get you a face-to-face with a curator or gallerist. \n\nDon't crush something positive in your child's life.", "Info: did you ask her why she was doing this?", "Sorry dude, YTA\n\nYour daughter alluded to something/someone at school \"annoying\" her. Did you even bother to ask her any probing/follow-up questions about what that could possibly be beyond \"people are annoying\"? There is something bothering your child to the point that she is choosing to skip school rather than deal with the issue day after day. She could be subjected to bullying, issues with teachers, depression, ANYTHING!\n\nInstead of throwing down the hammer and being dismissive with this \"do as i say\" attitude, why not have an open dialog to find out exactly what the underlying issue is and be willing to discuss options for a plan forward and negotiate with her.", "Well\u2026 let\u2019s be honest here. The issue isn\u2019t WHAT your daughter is doing, it is the lying and manipulating. If she were going to art galleries after school and on the weekends, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem, right? I don\u2019t think banning from galleries is a natural consequence. Extra work and making up missed work probably is. She needs to learn that school is important, not that art is bad or forbidden.", "YTA\n\nIf you want a rule, how about \"you have to go to school\"?  The art galleries are the symptom, not the disease.", "Yta....instead of grounding her you need to be asking why she was missing school....too much missing info", "1. YTA\n2. You're  a bad parent\n3. Is this your first time interacting with other humans?\n\n\nA child doesn't go from an A student with a lot of friends to a truant (that's someone who skips school) because of art galleries. \n\nArt galleries aren't  h e r o 1 n, once you try one you sont have to go on with more and more. \n\nSomething happened with the kids at school. She all but told you as much. As a parent you should ask her what it is and work with her to resolve it. Not alienate her with your deliberate ignorance.", "YTA. It AIN\u2019T about the art. Something is likely going on that she isn\u2019t telling you. A straight A student that starts ditching school for art galleries means that she is obviously high functioning and wants to be mentally challenged. However, something is going on at school that is making things difficult for her. Maybe a therapist could help her. You getting upset is only going to make matters worse.", "YTA sounds like you won\u2019t acknowledge her artistic side and you\u2019re putting too much pressure on daughters school life. Skipping school isn\u2019t okay-I get that.

She \"needs to become\" whatever the hell SHE wants. Its not up to you.", "YTA.   Not sure what you mean by \u201c what she needs to become\u201d\u2026.. what she becomes is her decision not yours. \n\nI suspect there is some deeper reason that she is spending so much time at the gallery. With the way you handled it, I doubt she\u2019ll confide in you.   If you approached it differently, you\u2019d have a shot at helping her have the best of both school and her art world.", "YTA - try asking your kid a follow up question.

Couldn't she go after school? Weekends?", "YTA\n\nSomething is clearly going on with your daughter and instead of trying to figure out what it is, you just randomly ban her from art galleries? That's the stupidest thing ever.", "You are a giant AH and what is wrong with this world.  Hoping you are just a  troll.", "YTA. This is clearly not just your daughter being difficult for the sake of being difficult. You need to figure out what\u2019s going on in her life and you\u2019re not going to do that by being punitive. You also shouldn\u2019t just take the teacher\u2019s word on what\u2019s going on. Teachers don\u2019t know everything going on between students. \n\nYou need to have a talk with her and open up the lines of communication.

She will defy you to keep following her passion, or obey you and be resentful of you doing that to her, perhaps for life.", "YTA there's something wrong with your daughter and grounding her isn't the way to go about finding out what's wrong", "YTA, too much missing info but I can\u2019t get over the \u201cstop letting her artistic desires drive her away from what she needs to become\u201d comment. What?? It sounds like she wants to get into visual arts but you\u2019re pushing her to do something \u201cuseful\u201d but soul-crushing without context. \n\nShe needs to go to school, but banning her from something she enjoys indefinitely isn\u2019t the answer. Is she skipping school perhaps because you don\u2019t support her hobbies/desires outside of school? It sounds like you don\u2019t value her opinion or wants and she\u2019s acting out for more than one reason.", "Both of you have horrible solutions. You are taking the one thing she seems interested in and your wife wants to enable her by just looking the other way. There's like... A way to address both things. \n\nESH - Your daughter is disregarding her responsibility as a student to pursue her interests. That's awesome she's interested in art and you should nurture that with the caveat she needs to start attending class. Positive reinforcement is much better than negative. Give her an incentive to work towards like taking her to an art gallery out of town as long as she attends class and makes passable marks. Should she be punished? Sure, have her so extra chores or something but acknowledge her interests and give her something to look forward to going to school for.", "Haha, grounding a 17 year old.", "ESH.  That's great that she enjoys staring at art.  That alone isn't going to get her any sort of job.  Besides I'm sure the art galleries are open after school and on weekends.  You need to sit down with daughter and school counselor and find out WHY she doesn't want to attend school.  There is a reason (my guess would be bullying) that needs to be identified and addressed.   Banning her from art galleries isn't going to accomplish anything.", "YTA maybe you should have her mom talk to her why she doesn\u2019t like the company of the people at school. she could be potentially be bullied or something and is skipping school as a way to escape. this is definitely something serious and you should try to think about how what you will do now will impact your relationship with your daughter for the rest of your life. If you ban her from galleries you are just pushing her away and make her resent you. Try to have positive reinforcement like other commentators suggested and try to see the real problem for why she\u2019s been skipping instead of just getting mad. Also she can become whatever she wants and art is a great way to express yourself.", "ESH..  So, she 17 and almost done with school.     How can you encourage her desire to enjoy art, maybe even be an artist and still have her finish??     Well, that's how I would look at it.   Maybe she needs to find some art programs, art schools and such, where she can learn more and really invest in her inner art desires.   Perhaps, you could help pay for those?  In exchange, she needs to agree to finish up school.", "YTA. Find a neutral third party (or better yet, let your wife find one) that your daughter can talk to. This behaviour doesn\u2019t just happen. \n\nThe bullying may be what she is feeling from you if you are forcing her into a specific skill set or occupation. Find someone she can talk to (councillor or therapist) and YOU listen with more of an open mind.", "OP's daughter sounds cool asf - but it also sounds like this is a serious cry for help and an indication that something larger is going on. \n\nPunishing your daughter is not the way to handle this at all. Instead maybe take her to lunch and then go to the gallery with her - ask her which paintings she likes and why, and ask her what's going on. \n\nTeacher's are great people when it comes to support but they can be seriously unaware of the things that are taking place, and I wouldn't trust that nothing is going on. It sounds like your daughter needs you. \n\nYTA.", "\u201cWhat she needs to become\u201d ?? \nWhat a crazy controlling thing to say. What she needs to become is something and someone only SHE knows. It\u2019s her sovereign right to be true to herself. If you did your job as a parent then she will be able to find her way. That was your job: prepare her to find and make her own way in this world. Now she\u2019s old enough and ready to do it, and your new job is to support her.", "YTA. There's always a reason why teenagers go from straight A students who enjoy school to regularly skipping school to \\[insert activity\\]. It may be something seemingly minor or it could be something incredibly tragic. Either way, part of your job as a parent is to be a safe place for her to confide what is going on and help to address it. Instead, you jumped straight to heavy handed restrictions and punishment instead of having an actual conversation to find out what's going on. \n\nIt's pretty telling that you were willing to have a conversation with a teacher and believe her without question (because teachers always know everything that goes on at school /s) but wouldn't extend the same courtesy to your own child.", "Here\u2019s the thing and this is going to be unpopular. A lot of people are giving OP flack for how he handled things, well the 17 year old was equally shitty at communicating where she was. The school and her parents still have a LEGAL responsibility for her safety and she was truanting and often enough that her school was concerned for her safety. There is evidently something going on and I agree that her parents need to find out what is so wrong that she prefers the company of inanimate objects to people. As a nearly \u2018adult\u2019 she has to realise her actions have consequences including for her parents who could be held accountable for her whereabouts.", "YTA. So your daughter has had a sudden change of behavior and instead of you trying to find out where it comes from, you decide to ban her from doing a harmless activity. You also just take the teacher\u2019s word as an absolute truth instead of trying to dig deeper by talking to your kid. Even a bigger AH for saying she should \u201cstop letting her artistic desire\u201d drive her away from what she \u201cneeds to become\u201d. Who decides what she needs to become, you? That last part is all you really care about, apparently.", "Eh. Kinda esh.

I... you know, many parents' first reaction would be to be thankful that their child was in an art gallery and not doing drugs or something worse. \n\nAnd honestly, the way you (don't) communicate with your daughter makes me think you take her for granted.", "NTA. She needs to grow up. She needs some discipline and clearly your wife hasn't been giving this to her, this is probably what got her there in the first place.

Look, you need to do something to actually address the situation. Like others have said the gallery isn't the issue, it's the symptom.\n\nA straight A student who enjoyed school and had good friends does NOT abruptly throw all of that away. \"Preferring the company of paintings\" sounds, to me, like someone in incredible pain. Just because she didn't immediately spill her guts to you doesn't mean it's a surface issue of wanting to slack off.\n\nYou need to get an adult she is comfortable speaking to involved. Her mom, another relative, or therapy. This is a major personality change and you should be worried. The first time I ever \"gave up\" on school was my last semester of undergrad, where I just wanted to pass and put in minimal effort... because I was crushingly depressed and barely wanted to be alive. I'm not saying that's necessarily what your daughter is experiencing, but something precipitated this.\n\nI would apologize and tell her you didn't mean to take away her joy, but it's important to finish school so she can be on an even playing field with others as an adult and have more options for herself. Could you or her mom regularly take her to the gallery after school once or a couple times a week if she fixes her attendance? Because the thing is, if something is wrong, sometimes you also need reflective time to think privately to get better. \n\nPlease reconsider. People don't make abrupt changes like this for no reason.

Even the guys wife isn't backing him, which again speaks to pattern of irrational parenting behavior he isn't addressing in this post.", "The situation is not always black and white. \n\nYes the daughter skipped school but the father should also try to get to the root of whatever the problem is at school thats causing the child to skip. From his post it doesnt sound like he's showing any empathy or mentioned any steps he took to understand what she may be going thru. \n\nUnless he's gonna watch her every move 24/7 she can continue to skip and now not be as forth coming about anything shes going thru because the fathers shown he's not open to discussion beyond what he sees as right. That will push the daughter away even more and may cause her to no longer see her parents or home as a safe space.", "She also seems like a great candidate for an after-school/weekend internship with a local gallery.", "Exactly. She may be bullied or people treat her like a pariah or something.", " ...and? Is that the most she said? Because clearly there is more to it than just that.\n\nDid you ask for her to elaborate?", "And you didn't ask anything else? YTA. \n\nThink about it this way: what if the teacher is worried because there is actual bullying going on and it's going to be revealed that she didn't handle it well? (Come for me, i'm overthinking too much, i know) but come on, i can't be the only one who thinks that her \"classmates being worried\" is bs\n\nAnd also \"my daughter should stop letting her artistic desires drive her away from what she needs to become\" please describe EXACTLY what you mean, because it's not painting you in a good way", "And you of course followed up with her teachers and councilor right.", ":D thank you!", "It made me have doubts that this is even real.\n\nThere's YTA and there's so cartoonishly AH that you can't believe a real person said it.", "No, the point is that they can't ground her. What are they going to do? Tie her to her bed?", "This.", "Probably because no-one has balls to set boundaries anymore.", "I don't think you're overthinking the teacher part. Thats a reasonable scenario.\n\nHere's another, related one. Teacher is clueless on bullying thats going on. Maybe she said its not happening because she hasn't seen or heard anything about it. And the classmates that are worried might be different from the ones that are bullying.", "Don't give Daddy Dearest here any ideas. \ud83d\ude44"]}
