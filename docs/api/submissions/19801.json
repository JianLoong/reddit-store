Your girlfriend only needs one thing, a different boyfriend.", ">So, since my gf is working and paying for everything at the moment I help her out by cooking, cleaning the house, using my EBT card to help her with groceries and I babysit her son while she works. \n\nRead that over to yourself. Do you really need to ask? Yes, YTA. Your wording implies that cooking and cleaning is her responsibility alone and you're just *helping*. If you live together these should be shared responsibilities regardless of whether or not you are both working.", "Daycare is a great solution\u2026..as soon as you start paying $600 rent, your girlfriend can chose to use daycare\u2026.until you\u2019re paying your fair share of the household bills\u2026you get to pull your weight, mind the child and stop whining.", "YTA ginormously!! Wtf is wrong with you?? You live rent free in her apartment don't pay for anything so its more than logical that you take up the house and any other duties around it. Shouldn't have played with the xbox while you're babysitting anyway and it's also your own fault you didn't put it in a babyproof place and giving the kid fricking soda in a spillable cup. Use your brain. Your audacity is beyond my comprehension.", "YTA. Giving soda to a toddler? What? And I sure hope you\u2019re not making watch the screen while you play, because that\u2019s incredibly detrimental to the child\u2019s development. He needs you to interact with him and make him interact with his surroundings, and you have plenty of time to spare.", "YTA-  baby-sitting is literally your job.  Don't like it? Move out and teach her a lesson.", "Weaponised incompetence. What exactly are you contributing?", "YTA SO MUCH YTA. I don't even HAVE children and I know better than you.", "This has to be fake", "Yup!! You are The A** H***. I don't believe that you started a relationship with a single mother of a 1yr old not knowing that by doing so, you would be taking on responsibilities that INCULDED the care of the child.", "Are you insane. Have you been sleeping and playing video games while watching a 2 year old... That's a huge safety risk and I can't emphasize enough on HUGE.", "Yta.\n\nDude, I think the kid has less shit in his pants than you. Hope she kicks you out asap.", "Info: what are you honestly bringing to the relationship?", "This has to be trolling? Right?\n\nYou can\u2019t possibly expect us to believe that someone old enough to be in a relationship that\u2019s serious enough to have reached the point of living together would type out a situation that makes it sound like they\u2019re basically the one being babysat by a 2 year old that\u2019s more mature than them, and still think they\u2019re somehow not an AH? \n\nWhether it\u2019s true or trolling, YTA either way. But damn I genuinely hope you\u2019re a troll, because if not then I have genuine concerns about the state of humanity!", "\"burden on my life\" lol...", "Moved in 4 months ago...haven't had a job in 4 months... sounds like she took you in when you broke.  She probably shouldn't have since you are unwilling to be a responsible adult in the household. You wrote this out like you're a child yourself. Should she put you in daycare too?\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Get a job and stop being a leech", "YTA.\n\nAlso when you\u2019re a freeloading bum, they aren\u2019t \u201cextracurricular activities\u201d just \u201cactivities\u201d since that\u2019s all you do and all you\u2019re good for.", "You\u2019re definitely a hobosexual.", "> I help her out by cooking, cleaning the house, using my EBT card to help her with groceries and I babysit her son while she works. \n\nNo, you don't \"help her out\" it's called contributing to the household being as she pays for everything. \n\n>. I try to sleep and he makes loud noise with his toys, wakes me by playing with my face or cries constantly. When I try to play my video games\n\nWhy are you sleeping or playing video games when you're responsible for a 2 year old?  You're guilty of neglect.\n\n>Lately, this has become extremely exhausting for me.\n\nAwww tiddums\n\n>Today, when he poured his soda on my Xbox was the last straw for me.\n\nMaybe you should of been watching him\n\n>haven\u2019t been working due to having a hard time finding jobs due to the economy.\n\nExactly when are you looking for work between sleeping and playing video games?\n\nYTA and a massive self absorbed child.  Get off your lazy ass and get a damn job, any job.\n\nI hope your gf kicks you out", "INFO: why are you giving a 2yr old soda??", "Nta ...she shouldn't even trust you to be with her child if you expressed you don't want to watch him. I have a 2.5 year old and 9 month old ...I would never ever leave them with someone who felt bothered by them even once. 2 is such a tough age and they need constant attention.  Tell her you need time without him so you can start going to temp agencies and get any job while you find permanent employment", "YTA.", "You have no job and moved into an apartment with your GF and her 2yr old son, how did you think this was going to work out? lol\n\nGo get a basic job and a share-house with some other people.\n\nYTA", "What a lucky gf. YTA.", "How about instead of sitting on your ass and gaming you get up and find a job? Your girlfriend is already paying for everything. You should do your part. You're being very selfish. YTA", "YTA. Get a job and then you have an argument for putting the kid in daycare. For now, you\u2019re basically having all your expenses paid and the deal is you take care of the kid. If you had another job, would you be able to play Xbox all day? You are ridiculously entitled. And I love the way you describe childcare like you\u2019re surprised it\u2019s actually work. If this isn\u2019t working for you, which is 100% understandable, then you can break up, move out, get a job, and support yourself.", "Plus, I'm not sure you can call it babysitting when it's your gf's kid and you moved in with them. Moving in with your partner and young kid should imply that you'll be responsible for that child if needed, it's not some service you're providing for your partner.", "Exactly right. She should look into other alternatives for a boyfriend.", "Right! She is working and you live together. She can either provide for you or pay for the daycare. \nAlso, if you're not planning on taking a father role for that kid - and being a parent is exhausting - stop wasting her time.", "They aren\u2019t even sharing a home. She\u2019s letting him live there while paying all the bills. \n\nIt\u2019s too bad that his one responsibility is getting in the way of his video gaming. \n\nYes this is a crappy economy, but if he wants the kid to go to a $600 day care he should get any job that will pay at least that.", "Not only that, but he's responsible for the kids actions. If the kid was able to pour something on the game, then he wasn't properly supervised.", "He doesn\u2019t want time to find a job but to sleep and game. How\u2019s she supposed to pay for child care if she has three mouths to feed, to pay for her house on her own, pay the bills for three? My sister and her husband even started working less because they can\u2019t afford child care on two incomes.", "The kid isn't the reason OP doesn't have a job.", "Plus the child is 2 and they have been dating for a year. Even if they moved in together 4 months ago he\u2019s been involved half the little guy\u2019s life and still thinks it\u2019s babysitting instead of parenting:/", "Also the two year old poured his soda on the video game?\n\nPutting all the other dreadful babysitting actions aside, who gives a 2 year soda? Who gives a 2 year old any drink in a spill able cup? They have almost no motor control at that age.\n\nA two year old can use cups at the table while seated but absolutely should not be wandering around with a can of soda. Wtf?", "It's not his kid .... I'm sorry but she should not leave her 2 year old with him.", "Yes but because he has shown to be incapable of doing so and she should kick him out, not because it\u2019s an unreasonable expectation that your partner is taking care of your child while you\u2019re working to pay his bills.", "She's only known him for 1 year and he clearly has no experience with small kids. A 2 year old should not be home all day they need to socialize with other kids or be with someone who will read to them and teach them to do things around the house not with someone who doesn't want them around. Kids pick up on negative feelings"]}
