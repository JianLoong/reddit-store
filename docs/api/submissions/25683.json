I don\u2019t particularly need to as I\u2019ve been slim my whole life, I just started going to get myself to be more active again. I don\u2019t have a set routine, I just focus on cardio and weights here and there.\n\nYesterday, while I was on the treadmill, a guy started walking on the treadmill next to me, which I thought was a little odd since the gym wasn\u2019t busy. He tapped me on my shoulder and gestured for me to take my headphones off. When I took them off I asked him if something was wrong and he started to introduce himself and let me know that he had noticed me whenever I arrive at the gym, since he is usually there at the same time. He started talking about how he\u2019s being going to the gym for a while now so he knows a lot about nutrition, the machines at the gym, how to achieve a specific target when working out etc. He said that he noticed that I don\u2019t really have a set routine when I work out and talked about how I don\u2019t designate days to one area of my body but instead just work on several parts of my body each time, not doing sets, not using specific machines and ended up just calling my workouts a sloppy mess and said that I need to have a work out plan to work on a different part of my body each time.\n\nI let him know that I don\u2019t take the gym seriously enough to want to create a plan, and I prefer to work on each part of my body in one session since I don\u2019t have the time to go to the gym everyday. After going back and forth of him telling me what I should do for each body and me repeating that I am perfectly okay with the way I do things, I ended up getting frustrated and told him to leave me alone, he looked really surprised at my reaction. Looking back at the look on his face, I slightly feel like I overreacted, but I also feel like my reaction was justified.\n\nI told my brothers about the encounter and they said I could\u2019ve handled the situation better - so I asked them to put themselves in my shoes, what if a random person had come up to you in the gym and let you know every time they see you working out they analyse what you do and formulate a routine for you, then gave you unsolicited advice despite you repeating the fact that you\u2019re comfortable with what you\u2019re doing. They still told me that I shouldn\u2019t have gotten frustrated and simply heard him out. Now I\u2019m just all round torn and don\u2019t know if I overstepped with my reaction. AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to thank those who reassured me about my response to him. To those who said I was too nice, honestly I don\u2019t have it in me to just tell someone I\u2019m not interested in the conversation right from the get go. I hate feeling like I\u2019m being unnecessarily rude. Also for those commenting that my brothers seem just like that guy and seem to be misogynistic - I completely understand. We come from a very stereotypical Caribbean family, which I think explains the type of men (and women) I have in my family and misogyny women face in our culture. \nThank you all again :).", "created_utc": 1693179982, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16363zu/aita_for_getting_frustrated_at_a_guy_giving_me/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
