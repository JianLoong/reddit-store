I had no issue with this, we get along fine.\n\nAnyways, we were all walking around enjoying our time when we saw some teen/ young adults dancing really well. My son loves music and dancing so he was excited and practically begged us to watch them perform. They were great, extremely talented and my son enjoyed it.\n\nThe song and dance was pretty \u201cfeminine\u201d but two of the dancers were male. Husband and I thought nothing of this and neither did my son. But my in laws were put off. My FIL looked a little disgusted for a lack of better words and he was especially concerned when he noticed my son trying to mimic their dancing. \n\nMy son was so hyped up and the dancers noticed I guess so they thanked him and even engaged with him a bit. It was a lovely sight. Not even going to lie, might\u2019ve been the best part of the vacation. I\u2019ve never seen my kid that happy haha. \n\nBut after we left and sat down at a restaurant, my FIL started ranting about the \u201cgay bullshit he had to witness.\u201d My husband told him to relax and not swear in front of our son but FIL was pissed. Said that we\u2019re being brainwashed and allowing our child to turn into one of them. \n\nI rolled my eyes and went \u201cboys that dance\u2026 how scary.\u201d My fil was like \u201cthat\u2019s not what I mean\u201d so I replied with \u201cmy bad, boys that dance with glitter on\u2026 even scarier\u2026 I\u2019m traumatized\u201d I then asked my son if he was traumatized which he obviously didn\u2019t understand so he just giggled and my fil got up and left saying that he refuses to be treated like a fool in public. Mil whisper yelled at me after saying I just ruined the trip and I should\u2019ve just kept my big mouth shut. \n\nMy husband didn\u2019t care and said his dad had it coming but it did ruin the trip. My fil was pissed at me the whole time and even ranted to a poor waiter the next night about how he gets treated like dirt by his son and DIL for simply voicing his concerns. He\u2019s also insisting that we should\u2019ve had a mature conversation instead of me mocking him and \u201cinvolving\u201d my son.
