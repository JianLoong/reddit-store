Absolutely not. You can do a week when the baby\u2019s 5. Three nights is way plenty, and they should be grateful for that. They can find someone else for the remaining days, or they can recognize that parents of small children can\u2019t ditch their kids for a week.", "NTA. You set a boundary, now enforce it. Tell them that they need to factor in the cost of childcare when they make their vacation budget because you will not be watching the kids. If I were you, I wouldn\u2019t even offer to watch them for part of the time they\u2019re gone. If you make yourself available for just a few days, their main childcare will suddenly \u201cfall through\u201d right before they\u2019re supposed to leave and you\u2019ll have cover the full seven days so they don\u2019t lose the money they spent on their vacation.", "NTA\n\nGrandparents are not free childcare. Often when you set a boundary, people will bang their head against that boundary to see if it holds. You did the right thing by letting them know your limit. Hold that line. You aren\u2019t responsible for their reaction.", "NTA - you told them no more than 3 days, so thats that.", "NTA. Heck I'm not even 50 and watching a 4 yr old and a 1 yr old for a week sounds exhausting! Plus your son sounds a bit entitled...\"they feel like we should do it for them since they need a break and what\u2019s a few more days.\" They need a break overseas???\n\nEdit: Overseas seems excessive but perhaps it really isn't. Overseas could be an Caribbean island from the US or something else. Shoot they could be  going for a trip the state over and I still find their demand entitled.", "No, you're NTA at all. You've already helped by watching your grandkids overnight a bunch of times. You said you can do it for up to 3 days, which is totally fair. Asking you to watch them for a whole week, especially while they're going overseas, is a lot.\n\nIt's not that you don't care about them, but it's also important to consider what you're comfortable with. Your son might be upset, but he should respect your limits and the effort you've already put in. Stick to what you're okay with and have a calm talk about how you can help in a way that works for everyone.\n\nYou agreed to 3 days. So they need to honor that.", "NTA. Remind them that you've had and raised your kids. Remind them that having children is the responsibility of the parents. If they can't afford to take the kids with them, then they shouldn't be going. Remind them that you have a boundary and that you also have a life now that your children are GROWN. Tell them they'll get the same freedoms when their own children are GROWN.", "NTA you have every right to tell them no, but be prepared for pushback. They both need to grow up - you're generous to watch them as much as you do and to continue badgering you after you've clearly said no is mean-spirited and childish. Tell them to dump the kids on HER parents.", "NTA\n\nYou're already helping them as much as you're comfortable with. Hang tough.", "NTA. \n\nIf you let them overstep this boundary it won't be the last time.", "NTA. Your son and wife are very entitled. A week is along time and especially with them being gone overseas.", "NTA. Now don\u2019t let them guilt you into it. Can\u2019t her parents watch them 4 days and you can watch them 3 days? Honestly though, I think that is way too long to be away from a 1 year old. (In my opinion.)", "NTA. I hate parents who try to palm their kids off for more than is offered. Your son is lucky that you will watch your grandkids for a few nights. So many people don't have that. If they didn't want the responsibility of having kids and taking them on holidays, they shouldn't have had kids.", "NTA, rightly so.", "NTA.    They have a lot of breaks....overnight with you,  and three  day stays", "NTA\nThey are not entitled to free child care just because they are your grandkids. You made it very clear your limit is 3 days and they are deliberately not listening and just trying to force it. You don\u2019t have to watch them at all.", "NTA \n\nIt is wonderful that you are so willing to be there for your son and be an active participant in your grandchildren\u2019s lives. As a nanny, I know so many parents dying for that kind of care and support from family/friends, it\u2019s really upsetting to see your son abusing that dynamic. \n\nUltimately, you aren\u2019t his free on demand childcare service. He doesn\u2019t get to whip out emotional manipulation to get whatever he wants out of you. You established a perfectly fair boundary, and he is actively refusing to respect it and is going so far as to punish you for your kindness up to this point.", "NTA. That\u2019s an unreasonable request. Tell them no.", "NTA.  You know your limits. However, keep your thoughts about them going overseas to yourself.  Providing the kids are ok with being separated from their parents for brief periods, a week should be fine. They would need to be with someone they are used to.", "NTA - can the other grandparents take them for the other 4 days?", "NTA", "NTA it not like you never babysitter before but ask for one whole week is asshole move. Ask your son if they can leave grandchildren with dil parents for 4 days first and have children spent the rest of time with you.", "NTA. Tell them no. If you agree to do 3 days for them, ensure whoever is doing the other 4 gets the first 4 days and you collect from them. So you\u2019re not given a week by stealth.", "NTA \n\nWhere are the other grandparents?", "NTA. My goodness, the entitlement. My in-laws babysit for us a lot. They like it, we like it, lol. But I'm always super paranoid about taking advantage. They kept our son this whole weekend bc my husband and I both worked. They also usually pick him up from school on Mondays. When I picked him up this evening I told them I am off work tomorrow so if they want a day off I will of course be more than happy to pick him up. They said no and that they will pick him up anyway. Your kid and spouse are definitely TA. Don't forget No is a complete sentence. Let's practice! \n\nNo.", "NTA, for obvious reason.\n\nThat said, I don\u2019t think you have grounds to criticize them for leaving their kids for a week if they do so responsibly. That\u2019s not really judgment you need to hold over them. But they are giant AHs for not respecting your boundaries and for trying to guilt you for saying no.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a long time for ANYONE to babysit. Especially those ages. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d be dropping them both at school everyday. Nap schedules and diapers and sleepless nights without mommy and daddy. Oomph.\n\nI\u2019m under the impression they didn\u2019t clear this with you before they booked? That\u2019s just entitlement. You may need to remind your son that this was not how you raised him (finger wag optional).\n\nI have two kids (8 & 5). We don\u2019t live close to family (air travel required). Getting an evening out is difficult let alone a couple of overnights. My mom is a saint and urges us to leave the kids with her for a few nights every time she visits. We take her up on it once in a while but never more than 2-3 nights. It\u2019s just a lot and, well, we know it. \n\nYour son and DIL know it too.", "Nta, were is your dil family? Are they able to cover the rest of the vacation? If you are still willing to cover three days", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDont let anyone guilt trip you to cross your boundaries. Stand up for yourself and remember NO is a complete sentence.", "I do hope they are looking for a four-day sitter and won't just burden you with the LO for the entire week.\n\nInsist on handover times, names, and contact numbers for the other sitter/s.\n\nAnd, of course, they should give both sets of sitters all of the childrens' medical and insurance information.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Simply because you set a boundary -their breaking it. Or trying too. Hold firmly. \n\nI also cannot imagine leaving my such young kids for that long especially in a different country.", "If they can afford a vacation overseas, they should be able to afford to hire a sitter for the kids. NTA", "NTA. Stop letting your kid take advantage of you. Just say NO.", "A good rule of thumb is that kids can handle one day away from their parents for every year.  The 4 year old can handle 4 days, but the one year old is going to have a seriously bad time.  Aside from breaching your set boundaries, the parents aren't being particularly considerate to their own children.", "As of right now, there is no interpersonal conflict here. \n\nThe asshole will be revealed when you tell them \"no\".", "NTA You absolutely have the right to say no to babysitting. Keeping children that you did not birth is a privilege. All parents are tired and need a break but they should have discussed it with you BEFORE they made plans.\n\nYTA by judging whether they need to go away while their kids are young. If you are not watching them, it\u2019s not your business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I absolutely love my grandchildren. But the truth is I\u2019m not young anymore and my stamina and ability to run around after them has greatly diminished. My heart wants them with me all the time, but my body doesn\u2019t agree. My concern is your son and DIL just seemingly expect you to watch two young kids without hesitation.

Nobody is owed free babysitting. If your son and DIL \"need a break\" then they can ***hire*** a babysitter. If they can afford to go on vacation for a whole week then they can afford a babysitter.", "NTA. You set boundaries and that\u2019s that. Where are the other grandparents? Kids equals responsibilities, and who in their right mind leaves their kids that age to go abroad? A 4 year old could maybe manage, but a 1 year old?", "\"They need a break\" - why is their need for a break more important than his parent's health and wellbeing? They signed up to have kids, and his parents were very clear about their boundaries - 3 nights is a huge amount. If they don't get to go overseas for a week without their children for a few years, well, that doesn't seem all that unreasonable a boundary placed on parents? As you say, when the youngest is 5, maybe OP will feel comfortable taking the kids for longer, but even then, maybe they won't, and that still doesn't make them the AH. What's with all these adults who decided their parents should do so much to help with the raising of their kids?"]}
