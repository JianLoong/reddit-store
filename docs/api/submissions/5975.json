Keep in mind that white elephant is just a game. All the kids got actual presents of things they asked for. We just do white elephant for fun. There is an even number of kids and adults, the youngest kid being 12 (my son). So the rule is to spend $25 for white elephant. No more, no less. The other rule is no gag gifts. So we have to buy something that both adults and kids/teenagers would enjoy. I bought JBL bluetooth headphones that was on sale on Amazon where the regular price was $40. \n\nLet me preface this by saying that my cousin spoils the hell out of her kids and it shows. She grew up middle-class like the rest of us but she married a guy who is from a very rich family, so over the years this has changed her...which is weird because he's actually a nice, humble guy. \n\nSo after all is said and done with white elephant, her kid ends up with the JBL headphones. He was clearly not happy. He even said \"These suck, I already have Beats.\" My 14-year-old niece said \"Give them to me! Those are nice!\" but he said \"No\" and kinda threw them on the sofa. My son got a friggan Foreman grill and was ecstatic and said \"I can make grilled cheese with this!\". Anyway after all the kids left the room to go play video games, my cousin asked all the adults \"Who bought the headphones?\" I told her I did and she said \"He doesn't want them because he has better ones. Can you return them and just give him $25?\" I said \"Absolutely not\" and she got very angry with me. I went on to say \"That's the nature of the game. This is a teaching moment. What are you telling your son by doing this?\" And she got even more upset saying who am I to tell her how to raise her kid and that I should worry about my own kid. I could have went on to say more that would have turned into a fight but I didn't want to ruin Christmas over something so stupid. At the end of the night she said \"Just think about it, be a good uncle, because right now you look stingy\". Her husband interjected and said to her \"Jesus, stop with that already!\" I just said \"Merry Christmas!\" So now I thought it was done but this morning I get a text from her telling me her Venmo account and said \"Just in case you change your mind.\"", "created_utc": 1672353334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zyirxx/aita_for_not_giving_my_cousin_25_in_lieu_of_a/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
