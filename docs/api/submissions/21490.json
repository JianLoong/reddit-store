We went no contact for 7 weeks and it was honestly so nice not having to walk on eggshells around her. \nShe has finally started to come back around and it\u2019s the same as before. \nIn her latest text she has been unbelievably horrible and mean and told me word for word \u201cIf you want to play the cutes game Well then we can play it like that because you.

I refused, said if you want her to go then the two of you should just go and I will take our daughter on a different vacation. \nHe is now ignoring me and calling me immature telling me I\u2019m letting a child ruin our vacation. \nI refuse to be trapped in a hotel room with her while she screams at me about how horrible I am and is mean to our daughter. Absolutely not. \nSo I canceled the vacation and got the refund. \nI told my mom and she told me she is only 11 and I should act like the grown up. \nI am now confused and hurt. \nAm I really that mean to cancel the vacation?

Everyone else has contributed to her becoming the brat that she is by being so soft. Good for you for standing strong for both you and your daughter. Good job, mama! NTA", "I posted this as a comment, but I think it needs to be here as well. Also will add some other thoughts.\n\nI'm sorry, but you have a husband problem. *He is showing you disrespect by allowing her behavior.* If he is unwilling to control his daughter and punish her for being mean and rude, it WILL NEVER get better.\n\nYou may find a break from husband and his drama will help you mentally and you may be able to see things more clearly.\n\nI am a step-parent and my SO has never tolerated this behavior from his child towards me. I also never tolerated this behavior from my own child towards my SO. The fact that yours allows it is terrible and you need to have a serious discussion with him. If he chooses to ignore it or brush it off as, \"she's only 11\" (which is BS, because she knows it's wrong) you have a hard decision to make. Stay and watch your own daughter start treating you with disrespect *(because she will, it's a learned behavior. How will you punish her for it, but allow her sister to continue doing it?)* or leave and have your daughter not be exposed to a child disrespecting you.", "NTA\n\nYour husband should have put a stop to this shit a long time ago.  He's the AH.  What the EX did was inexcusable.  All that said, your husband needs to sit her down, tell her that the cheating accusation is a lie, and that she can't talk to you that way.  He needs to up his parenting game.", "NTA yes, she\u2019s a kid. Yes, she\u2019s only 11. But her age doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s allowed to spew vitriol. Actions have consequences. If she\u2019s going to treat you like crap, that\u2019s her deal, but she doesn\u2019t then get to benefit from your efforts for vacations, etc.\n\nThere is a certain amount if shit you have to take from your kids because\u2026they\u2019re kids. However, her hateful texts cannot be ignored. You\u2019re not her punching bag. Her dad needs to step in. Her mom is obviously on board with her abusing you.", "NTA for canceling the vacation if it only would have lead to more bad behavior. But the problem you have isn't with your step daughter, it's with your husband and his ex.", "No leave her out. let her be miserable with her lying mother. She does not get to enjoy a vacation at the same time disrespecting you. Your husband needs to discipline her", "NTA. \n\nYou are canceling the vacation for a reason that parents cancel fun plans, because the child is acting up. A lot of parents discipline children by taking away fun things, it's like the most basic basic punishment there is, and in most cases, totally appropriate- drink underage, no prom, hit your brother, no trip to the toy store, tell your stepparent you want them to die, no waterpark!\n\nYour husband wants to ignore the way his child is acting, and that is unacceptable. If he was actually disciplining or working with his child to correct her behavior, then sure, go on the vacation. But he is doing NOTHING to help, and is happy to put you and your child in the room with an 11 year old who is openly verbally abusive. Not cool. \n\nTell your husband to deal with his kid, because it isn't your place, you know she is going through a lot, but she isn't safe to be around until HE steps up as a parent and actually tackles the situation.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter is behaving badly and clearly her biological parents are not disciplining her the way they should. Your husband is failing you by not disciplining his daughter and let her walk all over you. He doesn\u2019t even seem concerned for the daughter you share whom stepdaughter said she would never be nice to. Someone who lets their kid disrespect you doesn\u2019t respect you themselves. You were right to cancel the vacation.", "NTA, your husband is. This, is this problem to fix, not yours and not the 11 year olds. As her father he needs to be the one to correct her behavior. You get it, you're the step mom, why should she pay any attention to anything you have to say?", "NTA. There is absolutely zero reason to let a child treat someone this way. The people who think you should have obviously never dealt with blind hatred. The safety of your 5 year old could also be a concern. You can't reason with a child who is conditioned by her mother to hate you and your child. Your husband isn't being a father either by not putting a stop to such behavior. Well done, actions have consequences. I would refuse to be a part of such a toxic enviroment and yes, that child IS toxic and it's the fault of her mother and the lack of action by her father.", "11yo seems old enough to know how grave it is to wish somebody literally dead, and to knowingly and on purpose \"punish\" her sister as well is downright mean too. The real AH in here is her mother , who weaponizes her child and drags her into the fight with her ex. \n\nI think the only thing you migh do is the therapy and I don't know, maybe tell her how you and her father really met , even better if there some photos or something from that time... If she refuses to go to therapy (at 11 yo she might, you should've done this few years back maybe) at least you and your husband go and get some counseling from professional rather than reddit,  about how to handle this /explain to her etc.. \n\nI don't think you are the AH for cancelling the vacation if the relationship is so bad, just don't make it \"her fault\".", "INFO: How long have you and the 11 year old known each other? Also, have you and your husband had any conversations about how to approach her behavior?", "NTA but I think you have more of a husband problem and I\u2019d just drop them both at this point.", "NTA, you had the solution (separate vacations). If your husband has been reading the texts she sent and still thinks a blended vacation is ok, you take the room with your daughter and let him share with his.", "NTA but if you have a daughter that's 5 then this has been going on for what, 6 or 7 years?  I think you should give the 11 year old an option - she can come on vacation if she can be civil to you and nice to her sister. Your husband  can go alone with her  if she cant promise that- since he's not willing to stop this that seems like the best way.", "YTA, not for canceling vacation. But you've sunk to her level now. You've done everything she wanted when she sent those texts. There's now a wedge between you and your husband because of the actions you've done.", "Okay... as someone that's been the stepdaughter AND in the stepmom type position... I was terrible to my stepdad growing up, I NEVER cussed at him though. My MOTHER would have slapped me silly. My stepmom and I do not have an awesome relationship. She has said some nasty things to me and I've kept quiet about it all. I remain civil as an adult now and that's as good as she's going to get from me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow... having said that, I did NOT have the ex berating who I was with her child and the guy I was dating ensured that I received respect from his son. Their son and I were pretty tight, but it was because I had backup from his dad AND I made sure that he knew that I cared for him. Now, he was 6. When he didn't want to go back to his mom's, his dad just started yelling at him. I stopped him and said, \"Go do what you have to do. Let us talk please.\" His son saw that I defended his position to some extent. I just wanted to find out what was going on, because he hadn't ever acted like that before. It boiled down to his mom dating some new guy, dropping him off at grandma's to spend time with said new guy, and wanting to stay with us because we included him on our time together. So, I urged him to say something to his mom about it \\[because she was always a good mom, I couldn't say she was anything less\\]. The next time the guy I was seeing had his son, I got a great big hug and thanked because he did as I suggested and he actually had a lot of fun with his mom and her boyfriend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes it's a good idea to make sure the stepchild feels heard and wanted, even when they're being hateful. My stepdad did that for me and we're very close now. However, your husband needs to be onboard with having your back and not caving to his daughter anytime she throws a fit. He needs to help this relationship. My dad NEVER helped my stepmom and I have a relationship and it's put a wedge between he and I as well, especially the more I understood what was going on as an adult. He WILL absolutely lose if he doesn't help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy daughter was rotten to my husband \\[her stepdad\\] from about age 11 through 14. She even got CPS called on him. I had one hell of an ordeal with that crap and while everything turned out okay, it was extremely stressful for awhile. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI give you a soft YTA, but your husband a big AH. You cannot control what his ex says unfortunately. However, your husband can say something to his ex about it. Blended families are difficult to navigate. If your stepdaughter acts out like this, ask your husband to take a walk with you. Tell HIM why it's disrespectful for him not to act on her behavior. Tell him what is unacceptable and why. Yes, it's obnoxious, but necessary. Ask him why he thinks this is okay for a tween to act and what would've happened if he'd talked to his mother like that at the same age.", "Yta for not making your post a run along sentence", "YTA, both you and your husband honestly. Who the fuck goes \u2018no contact\u2019 on an *eleven year old*? On their own daughter? This girl is clearly in mental distress and needs therapy, not be be blocked and punished and ignored by the adults who are supposed to love her unconditionally. Canceling the vacation is not the problem, it\u2019s everything she else. Stop bickering about nonsense and failing this little girl.", "ESH. But most of all her parents.  They should have enforced some serious boundaries and limits.  \n\nHowever, she\u2019s 11 and going NC with an 11 year old is pretty fucked up.  And then canceling the trip really is reinforcing the idea she has about you.\n\nFamily therapy?\n\nI mean, I think at this point all you can do is sit your husband and your stepdaughter down and say, \u201cI hear that you hate me and I\u2019m not going to push myself into your life anymore.  I\u2019ll be right here if you ever want to try again because I love you but you win.\u201d\n\nAnd then just take a giant step back.  Your husband needs to step up, really.", "The fact you reference her as \u201cthe kid\u201d makes me think hell wicked step mum vibes, and u went NC for 7 weeks. (She\u2019s a child) She\u2019s your daughters sister not \u201cthe kid\u201d .grow up.", "YTA. Of course she wants to go on vacation with y\u2019all it\u2019s the fun time. You should not be a punching bag for his child nor should the daughter that you share be a punching bag. Your husband needs to be responsible and with his daughter at all times on vacations if it is that important for him to have her there. He also needs to put his foot down and explain that this crappy behavior will not continue. Just remember you are also canceling on your own child as well.", "YTA:\nFFS, you\u2019re as immature as a pre teen. No wonder she doesn\u2019t like you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
