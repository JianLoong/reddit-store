My husband has a daughter from previous marriage and she is 11f and I have a daughter with him who is now 5. \nI have had a rocky relationship with his daughter as her mom told her her dad cheated on her with me which is NOT the case. Nobody cheated in anybody they just were better off apart. Still to this day nobody knows why she has told their daughter that but she has and we\u2019ve been trying for years to tell her the truth but her mom is not budging, fine whatever. \nWe planned our first family vacation for the 4 of us to go and stay in a hotel for the weekend and enjoy the water park which is in site to the hotel. \nLast week his daughter texted me a number of texts telling me I am so horrible and mean and have ruined her life and she hopes I die in a car accident and how she will never be nice to our daughter because she hates me and her dad. \nAgain I\u2019ve had it rough with his daughter but she\u2019s 11 so I chalk it up to her being young a kid pretty much and I\u2019ve let go a lot of the horrible berating things she has said to me. We went no contact for 7 weeks and it was honestly so nice not having to walk on eggshells around her. \nShe has finally started to come back around and it\u2019s the same as before. \nIn her latest text she has been unbelievably horrible and mean and told me word for word \u201cIf you want to play the cutes game Well then we can play it like that because you. Know who is better at me \ud83d\ude18\ud83d\ude18\u201d because I told her I am done with her walking all over me and I will not be playing games. I have since blocked her. That was last Friday. \nOur vacation is booked for this weekend Friday-Sunday. \nThis morning my husband calls me and tells me how his daughter is begging to go on vacation and I should just be mature and move on. I refused, said if you want her to go then the two of you should just go and I will take our daughter on a different vacation. \nHe is now ignoring me and calling me immature telling me I\u2019m letting a child ruin our vacation. \nI refuse to be trapped in a hotel room with her while she screams at me about how horrible I am and is mean to our daughter. Absolutely not. \nSo I canceled the vacation and got the refund. \nI told my mom and she told me she is only 11 and I should act like the grown up. \nI am now confused and hurt. \nAm I really that mean to cancel the vacation? I mean the kid told me she I hope I would die and messaged the family\nIpad we have that her and my daughter FaceTime on and told her she would never be nice to her again because she hates me. \nSorry this is long and full of rambling but AITA?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdited to add: this is the FIRST time she\u2019s ever lashed out towards my daughter. I have never left them alone without me or their dad present. \nWe try to stay out of the house and stay busy such as pool and park and mall and things. When we are home my daughter is clingy to me naturally and so by that nature they aren\u2019t ever alone. Anytime she has even tried to be the slightest bit mean towards our daughter I shut it down immediately. \n\n\n\n\nWe see her usually 3 days a week Friday-Sunday. We aren\u2019t full time with her, I have pushed for that idea for several years to give her more stability and more structure but her mom says absolutely not. ONLY ME went no contact with her and by that I mean she did not come to our house and we did not speak. Her dad picked her up and they did their own things for the weekend. The times our daughter joined was to go to the park or local fair or outside activities basically. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhen she was younger she was never this bad verbally she was really only whiney would come over and cry for hours and her dad and me would just hold her and try to comfort her. This level of abuse has gone up in the past year to get this bad. \n\n\n\n\nI have pushed for therapy for years for her and for us. Her mom shuts me down and won\u2019t even entertain the idea. She again says her daughter is fine and something is wrong with me lol. I have my child in her own therapy as well as me but I guess I should open up more to my therapist about what is going on with my step daughter. \n\n\n\n\nIn the latest messages she called me \u201ctattle tell cry baby who tells her dad everything \u201c that was last Friday and he saw her that night. I assumed (dumb of me) that she would mention it to him and I guess she did not. When he called me to say she was begging to go on vacation I asked well did you read our texts or did she tell you anything? He said no. So I gave him a few quotes while we were on the phone. He said he would speak with her. \n\n\n\nAnytime he defends me and shuts her down she tells him she doesn\u2019t want to see him and he can live with his new family. Again I want to emphasize her mom is remarried and has had 2 children with another man!!!!!! So I again am not sure why he is not allowed to move on and her mom is. \n\n\nI am seeing i have a husband problem he is basically letting and allowing this to happen. We have had it out a few times about her behavior and he says he\u2019s working on it but he doesn\u2019t want to her. Idk what that means at this point.  \n\n\nDuring the week when it is just us 3 we function great at a unit. It\u2019s not until the weekend does he\u2019ll break loose. Again when I went no contact she did NOT come to our house and that\u2019s what I meant by not walking on eggshells my house felt at ease and I was not being verbally abused. \n\n\n\n\nTonight when I am home I will show my husband this thread and let him read the messages.  \n\n\n\n\nMaybe it\u2019s important maybe not, but the mom speaks broke\u2019 English so I know it was stepdaughter texting me and not mom. There\u2019s is a language barrier there.", "created_utc": 1688653026, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14sajpm/aita_for_canceling_vacation/", "score": 1188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He needs to up his parenting game.", "NTA yes, she\u2019s a kid. Yes, she\u2019s only 11. But her age doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s allowed to spew vitriol. Actions have consequences.

A lot of parents discipline children by taking away fun things, it's like the most basic basic punishment there is, and in most cases, totally appropriate- drink underage, no prom, hit your brother, no trip to the toy store, tell your stepparent you want them to die, no waterpark!\n\nYour husband wants to ignore the way his child is acting, and that is unacceptable. If he was actually disciplining or working with his child to correct her behavior, then sure, go on the vacation. But he is doing NOTHING to help, and is happy to put you and your child in the room with an 11 year old who is openly verbally abusive. Not cool. \n\nTell your husband to deal with his kid, because it isn't your place, you know she is going through a lot, but she isn't safe to be around until HE steps up as a parent and actually tackles the situation.", "NTA. Your stepdaughter is behaving badly and clearly her biological parents are not disciplining her the way they should. Your husband is failing you by not disciplining his daughter and let her walk all over you.

The people who think you should have obviously never dealt with blind hatred. The safety of your 5 year old could also be a concern. You can't reason with a child who is conditioned by her mother to hate you and your child. Your husband isn't being a father either by not putting a stop to such behavior.

If she refuses to go to therapy (at 11 yo she might, you should've done this few years back maybe) at least you and your husband go and get some counseling from professional rather than reddit,  about how to handle this /explain to her etc.. \n\nI don't think you are the AH for cancelling the vacation if the relationship is so bad, just don't make it \"her fault\".", "INFO: How long have you and the 11 year old known each other?

I think you should give the 11 year old an option - she can come on vacation if she can be civil to you and nice to her sister.

I was terrible to my stepdad growing up, I NEVER cussed at him though. My MOTHER would have slapped me silly. My stepmom and I do not have an awesome relationship. She has said some nasty things to me and I've kept quiet about it all. I remain civil as an adult now and that's as good as she's going to get from me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow... having said that, I did NOT have the ex berating who I was with her child and the guy I was dating ensured that I received respect from his son. Their son and I were pretty tight, but it was because I had backup from his dad AND I made sure that he knew that I cared for him. Now, he was 6. When he didn't want to go back to his mom's, his dad just started yelling at him. I stopped him and said, \"Go do what you have to do. Let us talk please.\" His son saw that I defended his position to some extent. I just wanted to find out what was going on, because he hadn't ever acted like that before. It boiled down to his mom dating some new guy, dropping him off at grandma's to spend time with said new guy, and wanting to stay with us because we included him on our time together. So, I urged him to say something to his mom about it \\[because she was always a good mom, I couldn't say she was anything less\\]. The next time the guy I was seeing had his son, I got a great big hug and thanked because he did as I suggested and he actually had a lot of fun with his mom and her boyfriend. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSometimes it's a good idea to make sure the stepchild feels heard and wanted, even when they're being hateful. My stepdad did that for me and we're very close now. However, your husband needs to be onboard with having your back and not caving to his daughter anytime she throws a fit. He needs to help this relationship. My dad NEVER helped my stepmom and I have a relationship and it's put a wedge between he and I as well, especially the more I understood what was going on as an adult. He WILL absolutely lose if he doesn't help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy daughter was rotten to my husband \\[her stepdad\\] from about age 11 through 14. She even got CPS called on him. I had one hell of an ordeal with that crap and while everything turned out okay, it was extremely stressful for awhile. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI give you a soft YTA, but your husband a big AH. You cannot control what his ex says unfortunately. However, your husband can say something to his ex about it. Blended families are difficult to navigate. If your stepdaughter acts out like this, ask your husband to take a walk with you. Tell HIM why it's disrespectful for him not to act on her behavior. Tell him what is unacceptable and why. Yes, it's obnoxious, but necessary. Ask him why he thinks this is okay for a tween to act and what would've happened if he'd talked to his mother like that at the same age.", "Yta for not making your post a run along sentence", "YTA, both you and your husband honestly. Who the fuck goes \u2018no contact\u2019 on an *eleven year old*? On their own daughter?

As you said show and discuss the messages with your therapist along with the husband problem. \n\nYou might discuss with your husband going to court and insisting on therapy for your stepdaughter using those same texts. \n\nAnd please do not let stepdaughter have any unsupervised time with your daughter.   I had a friend a long time ago who had a daughter and later divorced.  After she remarried they had a LO so about 6 years difference in age.  Her daughter tried multiple times to hurt the LO (did it in front of multiple people so not like an accident) to the point after 4 years she went back to court to give full custody with no contact to her ex.  The only good things that came out of it was her LO was safe and her ex, who with his new wife had pushed being the cool dad with no rules etc, got the joy of dealing with being real dad.", "So you should be abused verbally as well as barraged over text for\u2026..the rest of your life???? You all need to go therapy and sit down and talk about this Christ. Kid hates you for what is a lie.", "I know this group loves to suggest therapy, but respectfully, what will that solve? The SD thinks OP was the other woman; she is not going to overcome that through therapy.", "Can you and your husband go to therapy together? I think that would be a great start", "I have a little girl, and I've worked with kids for years. Your husband is flat out wrong. Boundaries make a kid feel secure, because they know where their limits are. They'll protest and push to see if the boundaries will hold, but then they settle and they're happier.\n\nNo boundaries? They feel insecure, unhappy, angry,they lash out. Everything in the world feels unfair because there's no consistency in how they're treated, and what reaction they'll get from their behaviour. They keep doing more and more wild things in a desperate attempt to get your attention and see if THIS will be the time you set boundaries & they hold.\n\nYour husband thinking boundaries are mean is probably why he's divorced. His ex knows that, and was probably worried about losing her child to the Fun Weekend Dad, because she has to keep things together all week. Not an excuse AT ALL for lying to her kid, just saying it may have come from a place of desperation because she knows her ex", "A kid can\u2019t be allowed to speak to you like an equal. There should have been punishments in place for disrespect loooong ago. You are set up to fail here. You should not be the kid\u2019s friend. You should be a parent/guardian.", "Honestly I'm more concerned for you and your daughter's safety than I am for your daughter learning horrible behaviour. This is not normal behaviour for an 11 year old. The language, death wishes, vitriol and text campaigns are a big red flag. \n\nHer parents are utterly negligent towards her for allowing this to continue and your husband is similarly negligent towards you and your shared child. \n\nIf she's this rage filled and verbally violent AT 11!! It's not going to get any better when she's older. \n\nIf it was me in this situation, I'd have therapy as a deal breaker. Both individual and family; including your husband and at some point including his ex-wife. \n\nYou have a huge husband problem.", "So if 11 is too young for consequences, does that mean her school has no rules? Like kids just wander the halls, throw things, hit each other, take other people\u2019s stuff? If so, where is that school so I can NOT go there?", "third uninvolved party may provide more trustworthy explanation than OP and her dad yelling \"we did not do it\" basically. \n\nAlso she might not dare to a stranger what she does at home, hence they may even have aconversation for a change. \n\nI don't think therapy would solve everything, but might provide opportunity for them to communicate in much more controlled and calmer manner. \n\nAnyways if she does not participate, child psychologist may have some new ideas how to approach the SD. I think it is definitely worth it before talking divorce, because if this does not resolve it is definitely in divorce territory as she bullies her sister as well.", "I thought the same thing. I\u2019m guessing there is more to the story here. Just the way she talks about the little girl gives me a bad vibe. Any time I see these kinds of posts from step parents, I\u2019m more committed to making my marriage work so I never have to worry about a stepmom resenting my kids if they\u2019re upset about the divorce. \ud83d\ude33", "Ignore that person, they\u2019re insane. You are NTA for not rewarding this disgusting behavior. I hope your husband grows a backbone because he\u2019s enabling this and you and your baby girl don\u2019t deserve to be treated that way. When I was 11, had I acted this way I would get an ASS WHOOPING. She\u2019s grown enough to know to respect her elders. She just know she can get away with it so she keeps doing that shit but I guarantee you if she got an ass whooping she would learn real quick. Keep standing your ground. You\u2019re not \u201cimmature\u201d for asserting boundaries and expecting to have those boundaries respected.", "I was thinking the same thing, she does have a husband problem. Her husband needs to step up to the plate on this one. In the meantime, OP is doing the right thing by establishing boundaries.", "Like me as an 11yr old if I texted something mean mum would have put the fear of god in me. Like no matter who, you don\u2019t be mean like that", ">designated meal of steamed clams.\n\nNo, no. I said 'steamed hams.' That's what I call hamburgers.", "I will agree wholeheartedly that OP let this go on waaaay too dang long. No disagreement there. But the only way for her to do anything is to leave him. He's the only one who can do anything about his daughter's attitude and behavior.", "I\u2019m Mexican and your husband is so wrong for lack of words I want to use but can\u2019t here. I don\u2019t understand why people dismiss troubling behaviors from children. That\u2019s when you should be addressing them right away so they learn what is right and wrong while their brains are developing. That little girl is going to be a bully and an unpleasant member of society as an adult if they don\u2019t get her help now.", "Hey, another bot replied to you;  /u/FrostyMortga30 is a scammer!  **Do not click any links they share or reply to**.
