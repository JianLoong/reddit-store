Her father is not in the picture and I'm raising her with the help of my grandma (to be clear me and Anna live in her house and I help her around the house and with bills, and she looks after Anna while I'm working).\n\nAbout a month ago Anna had a very complicated operation, this is for a condition she had since she was born and operation essentially saved her life. However I had to borrow money from family including my sister to make sure the operation would go ahead and I am paying it back slowly. The operation has a long recovery period, the doctors said it might take up to 6 months for her to be back to normal. Due to this Anna gets tired really quickly, especially after active play time. Because she is recovering she can take naps and sleep as much as she needs, I have also made sure to break the main meals into 6-8 smaller meals so it is easier to eat, as recently she found eating boring because it takes too long.\n\nShe has friends visiting her and the rule with them and their parents is that if Anna gets tired they move into less active activities like watching a cartoon or reading which they can understand and have been complying with without issues.\n\nThursday my sister came around with her son and asked me to look after him for a bit as something came up at work. She knows about Anna recovering and needing rest and assured me it was for an hour or 2. My nephew \"Kyle\" is 5 and as soon as he got into the house he wanted to play with Anna. My grandma wasn't home as she had to visit a friend so I was looking after them. After about an hour Anna has mentioned she was tired and wanted to watch some cartoons on Disney, but Kyle still wanted to play and didn't want to watch \"girly\" cartoons, he wanted to keep playing. I have told Anna she can go to her room and watch it there and I will look after Kyle, but he didn't want to let go of Anna and kept insisting she must play with him since \"his mummy paid us\". That didn't sit well with me and he was throwing a tantrum refusing to accept that Anna needs rest, so I called my sister and told her to pick Kyle up immediately.\n\nMy sister did show up but she wasn't happy and called me an asshole since she was in an important meeting, and I could have sucked it up since she loaned me money for Anna's operation, so it is the least I could have done. After this I have asked her to leave.\n\nLater that day I received a call from my mum saying I was an asshole too and shouldn't have asked my sister to pick up Kyle since its just her looking after him as Kyle's dad is in military and currently away.\n\nEdit: as a lot of people seem to be missing out, Kyle latched onto Anna and would not let her go. He was holding her making her unable to rest until she carries on playing with him, making her really stressed. I have tried take her from him and bring to the bedroom but he would not let her go at all. And I didn't want to risk him hurting her since her scars from operation are still fresh and only recently started to heal properly.", "created_utc": 1673129283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106161y/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_immedietly_pick_up/", "score": 526, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids that age don't need that kind of detail about finances.", "YTA. What I read her is that you can\u2019t manage a 5 year old for 2 or 3 hours or don\u2019t want to go to the trouble. I get that your kid needed her rest & the 5 year old grabbed her. Big deal. You are the adult. What would you do if you were at the playground & some kid you didn\u2019t know grabbed your daughter? I bet you would separate them pretty quick. 5 year olds throw tantrums & mouth off. What are you going to do when Anna throws one & there\u2019s no one else to call?  What if your grandma called you out of work when she was watching Anna because Anna was rude to her?", "NTA but if your sister is going to throw the fact she gave you money in your face, I\u2019d never ask her for anything ever again and go LC/NC.", "NTA She would be the first person I would pay off if she is going to use this excuse \u201cthat it\u2019s the least you can do\u201d to have her throw that up in your face that would end it there.

Surely you could have come up with some creative ways or further enforced the boundaries. Heck, I bet if you told Kyle to sit down with a bowl full of candy and chips, and let your daughter go in her room, she would have. I think your sister would have understood given the circumstances. \n\nYTA here for not learning to properly manage the behaviours of children while being a parent of your own.", "Kyle is a 5 year old child. It can be hard, but having a 5 year old right NOW, you can 100% pull empathy and reasoning into them. You lost an opportunity here to help your nephew, your sister and quite frankly your own child. You could have spent more time walking her through setting her own boundaries.\n\n5 year olds are simple. You absolutely could have helped him stopped focusing on losing an activity, having him understand and then helping him find a new appropriate activity.\n\nI\u2019m glad your daughter is going to be ok, but you need to tread lightly moving forward with her being able to be able to kick anyone out whenever she wants. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s happening, what I\u2019m saying is it can build poor coping skills and entitlement. A better approach for a play date is to talk to her about that length of time. \u201cCan you do 1 hour today?\u201d If so she needs to be held to not removing her friends for that hour because THEYRE ALSO CHILDREN. After that hour mark she can end the playdate or reevaluate if she feels up to more.\n\nFinally tho: your sister. How dare she say that to her son. Fuck that noise. If she would like you to pay back through childcare that conversation needs to be had in private and kept away from the kids. Period.", "NTA. But you can\u2019t control a kid? No means no. Take Anna in the bedroom and close the door and he can continue playing on his own.", "ESH.\n\nYTA because you got mad at a 5 year old throwing a tantrum. That's what 3-5 year olds do! It's part of their development. I'm also rather critical of your daughter's media consumption, but let's put that aside. You agreed to watching over him so she can work, but the moment he annoys you, he's out? Imagine your grandma doing the same to you while you'reat work.\n\nYour sister is an asshole for guilting you with the money she lent you and for apparently pointing that out in private so much that even her 5 year old picked it up.", "You were incapable of setting a simple boundary with a 5yo? Nah, you wrangle a kid who doesn't enjoy her limitations like a boss. So you just didn't feel like babysitting. YTA.", "Kind of sounds like ESH. Your sister for using the loan as leverage, and for apparently talking abt you and the loan behind your back (I can\u2019t think of any other reason her 5yo would make a comment like that); your mother for inserting herself into an issue that is clearly between you and your sister; and you a little bit for just defaulting to making your sister pick him up instead of taking authority and putting him on a timeout. 5 is a bit too old to be throwing temper tantrums without some consequences. If it wasn\u2019t work I would have probably done the same, but if my sister was at work and her kid was behaving like a brat I would just suck it up until she was done.", "I\u2019m need a No One is the Asshole.

I don\u2019t think anyone was particularly TA, they all just had different expectation of what was going to happen", "How old are you?  YTA/ ESH.... you're a parent, start parenting. Let your 6 yr old daughter go rest, and take your 5 yr old nephew outside, play a game, or cook something.... seriously, anything other than what you did.

You\u2019re an adult and the boy is 5. Pretty sure you can get him off your daughter and manage to separate the two. Single people care for multiple kids all the time safely but it sounds like you just didn\u2019t want to put in the effort Your sister should have been able to count on you, regardless of the money, especially since it was for work and not to go shopping or something frivolous.", "Wow, you got punked by a 5 year old.  You need to put on your big girl panties and lay down the\n law.", "YTA it\u2019s not that hard to manage a 5 year old in order to help your sister out.

Maybe the sister was rude about the money, but that was after you called her to pick her son up immediately as if he's a maniac that cannot be dealt with. She was rude, but your rejection of your nephew was too. Sometimes helping out your family with their kids means they won't be perfect, as yours wouldn't be with them as well, but they trust you to handle the situation as an adult instead of villainizing a literal child and acting helpless. Yeah, sounds like he was being a brat but putting up with our family members unique quirks and helping shape your nieces and nephews positively is part of loving your family, otherwise you are expecting to be handed a perfect child, which is honestly unreasonable. This doesn't sound like anything outside the bounds that I would expect to possibly put up with watching a family members child, they might even throw a fit!

There is no need to put her in danger from normal kid behavior. \n\nI'm sure in a couple weeks, it will be healed enough for this not to be a concern. \n\nBut, whatever your sister is saying while you are not around is clearly an issue if her son said that comment about money.

Kids with money think they are entitled to whatever they want, whenever they want it!", "Ahem.......\n\n\n\n\n*Kyle is still an asshole*.", "Not sure what Tasmania has to do with anything, but do you think the daughter needs 24 hour supervision? Do you think OP needs to watch her sleep all night too? She can easily do some things with her nephew and still check in on her daughter every 20-30 min", "The kid is the one and only Tasmania, causing destruction and giving tantrums. \nHer daughter is sick. \nShe shouldn't though if sister has one ounce of compassion in her body which she doesn't. Her nephew was holding her child who still has stitches.\nThis woman is tired and had to deal with a entitled brat child and his entitled mother.", "Ok I\u2019m guessing you meant the Tasmanian Devil from Looney Toons. If she didn\u2019t have the energy to deal with an extra kid, she should\u2019ve told the sister that before agreeing to babysit so sister could find other arrangements. And it\u2019s not entitled to ask family to help out.", "The reaction from her sister and the behavior of her own children says she expect OP and her child to please them because of 5k loan that has been paid for the most part. It's entitled to expect someone in OP's situation to be able to help or to ask them for help. The child is not fully recovered. But again she thinks OP 'owes' her that"]}
