Her father is not in the picture and I'm raising her with the help of my grandma (to be clear me and Anna live in her house and I help her around the house and with bills, and she looks after Anna while I'm working).\n\nAbout a month ago Anna had a very complicated operation, this is for a condition she had since she was born and operation essentially saved her life. However I had to borrow money from family including my sister to make sure the operation would go ahead and I am paying it back slowly. The operation has a long recovery period, the doctors said it might take up to 6 months for her to be back to normal. Due to this Anna gets tired really quickly, especially after active play time. Because she is recovering she can take naps and sleep as much as she needs, I have also made sure to break the main meals into 6-8 smaller meals so it is easier to eat, as recently she found eating boring because it takes too long.\n\nShe has friends visiting her and the rule with them and their parents is that if Anna gets tired they move into less active activities like watching a cartoon or reading which they can understand and have been complying with without issues.\n\nThursday my sister came around with her son and asked me to look after him for a bit as something came up at work. She knows about Anna recovering and needing rest and assured me it was for an hour or 2. My nephew \"Kyle\" is 5 and as soon as he got into the house he wanted to play with Anna. My grandma wasn't home as she had to visit a friend so I was looking after them. After about an hour Anna has mentioned she was tired and wanted to watch some cartoons on Disney, but Kyle still wanted to play and didn't want to watch \"girly\" cartoons, he wanted to keep playing. I have told Anna she can go to her room and watch it there and I will look after Kyle, but he didn't want to let go of Anna and kept insisting she must play with him since \"his mummy paid us\". That didn't sit well with me and he was throwing a tantrum refusing to accept that Anna needs rest, so I called my sister and told her to pick Kyle up immediately.\n\nMy sister did show up but she wasn't happy and called me an asshole since she was in an important meeting, and I could have sucked it up since she loaned me money for Anna's operation, so it is the least I could have done. After this I have asked her to leave.\n\nLater that day I received a call from my mum saying I was an asshole too and shouldn't have asked my sister to pick up Kyle since its just her looking after him as Kyle's dad is in military and currently away.\n\nEdit: as a lot of people seem to be missing out, Kyle latched onto Anna and would not let her go. He was holding her making her unable to rest until she carries on playing with him, making her really stressed. I have tried take her from him and bring to the bedroom but he would not let her go at all. And I didn't want to risk him hurting her since her scars from operation are still fresh and only recently started to heal properly.", "created_utc": 1673129283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106161y/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_immedietly_pick_up/", "score": 190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids that age don't need that kind of detail about finances.", "YTA. What I read her is that you can\u2019t manage a 5 year old for 2 or 3 hours or don\u2019t want to go to the trouble. I get that your kid needed her rest & the 5 year old grabbed her. Big deal. You are the adult. What would you do if you were at the playground & some kid you didn\u2019t know grabbed your daughter? I bet you would separate them pretty quick. 5 year olds throw tantrums & mouth off. What are you going to do when Anna throws one & there\u2019s no one else to call?  What if your grandma called you out of work when she was watching Anna because Anna was rude to her?", "NTA but if your sister is going to throw the fact she gave you money in your face, I\u2019d never ask her for anything ever again and go LC/NC.", "NTA She would be the first person I would pay off if she is going to use this excuse \u201cthat it\u2019s the least you can do\u201d to have her throw that up in your face that would end it there.

Surely you could have come up with some creative ways or further enforced the boundaries. Heck, I bet if you told Kyle to sit down with a bowl full of candy and chips, and let your daughter go in her room, she would have. I think your sister would have understood given the circumstances. \n\nYTA here for not learning to properly manage the behaviours of children while being a parent of your own.", "Kyle is a 5 year old child. It can be hard, but having a 5 year old right NOW, you can 100% pull empathy and reasoning into them. You lost an opportunity here to help your nephew, your sister and quite frankly your own child. You could have spent more time walking her through setting her own boundaries.\n\n5 year olds are simple. You absolutely could have helped him stopped focusing on losing an activity, having him understand and then helping him find a new appropriate activity.\n\nI\u2019m glad your daughter is going to be ok, but you need to tread lightly moving forward with her being able to be able to kick anyone out whenever she wants. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s happening, what I\u2019m saying is it can build poor coping skills and entitlement. A better approach for a play date is to talk to her about that length of time. \u201cCan you do 1 hour today?\u201d If so she needs to be held to not removing her friends for that hour because THEYRE ALSO CHILDREN. After that hour mark she can end the playdate or reevaluate if she feels up to more.\n\nFinally tho: your sister. How dare she say that to her son. Fuck that noise. If she would like you to pay back through childcare that conversation needs to be had in private and kept away from the kids. Period.", "NTA. But you can\u2019t control a kid? No means no. Take Anna in the bedroom and close the door and he can continue playing on his own.", "ESH.\n\nYTA because you got mad at a 5 year old throwing a tantrum. That's what 3-5 year olds do! It's part of their development. I'm also rather critical of your daughter's media consumption, but let's put that aside. You agreed to watching over him so she can work, but the moment he annoys you, he's out? Imagine your grandma doing the same to you while you'reat work.\n\nYour sister is an asshole for guilting you with the money she lent you and for apparently pointing that out in private so much that even her 5 year old picked it up.", "You were incapable of setting a simple boundary with a 5yo? Nah, you wrangle a kid who doesn't enjoy her limitations like a boss. So you just didn't feel like babysitting. YTA.", "Kind of sounds like ESH. Your sister for using the loan as leverage, and for apparently talking abt you and the loan behind your back (I can\u2019t think of any other reason her 5yo would make a comment like that); your mother for inserting herself into an issue that is clearly between you and your sister; and you a little bit for just defaulting to making your sister pick him up instead of taking authority and putting him on a timeout. 5 is a bit too old to be throwing temper tantrums without some consequences. If it wasn\u2019t work I would have probably done the same, but if my sister was at work and her kid was behaving like a brat I would just suck it up until she was done.", "I\u2019m need a No One is the Asshole.

I don\u2019t think anyone was particularly TA, they all just had different expectation of what was going to happen", "How old are you?  YTA/ ESH.... you're a parent, start parenting. Let your 6 yr old daughter go rest, and take your 5 yr old nephew outside, play a game, or cook something.... seriously, anything other than what you did.

You\u2019re an adult and the boy is 5. Pretty sure you can get him off your daughter and manage to separate the two. Single people care for multiple kids all the time safely but it sounds like you just didn\u2019t want to put in the effort Your sister should have been able to count on you, regardless of the money, especially since it was for work and not to go shopping or something frivolous.", "Wow, you got punked by a 5 year old.  You need to put on your big girl panties and lay down the\n law.", "YTA it\u2019s not that hard to manage a 5 year old in order to help your sister out.

It's part of being that village that everyone expects to help them with their kids. \n\nThe \"village\" helped her save her kids life, now it's her turn to be part of the village because it's not just there for her benefit.", "Manhandling is neither the beginning, middle, nor end of how you deal with a 5-year-old's temper tantrum.   \n\n\nNeither is throwing your hands in the air.  \n\n\nIf OP is going to babysit, she should know how to deal with a tantrum constructively.", "I am blown away by the people who are not understanding that your daughter had major surgery 1 month before.  I hope you can get past their idiocy.", "He was throwing a temper tantrum, and from the sounds of it, you don't have anything in your toolbox for how to deal with such a situation. Temper tantrums while babysitting are nothing new -- the internet is full of advice on what you could have done. It sounds like you just didn't feel like dealing with the problem because of the nasty thing he said.", "As the adult, you step in and stop him.", "OP I\u2019m so sorry you have to keep explaining this. I\u2019m floored at the amount of people that seem to forget/discount that Anna is recovering from surgery. You are so NTA. I can\u2019t believe Kyle\u2019s. Mom isn\u2019t mortified by his behavior.", "It's a 5 year old not a pair of handcuffs.", "I'm guessing a lot of this is, Kyle is a boy, and boys will be boys but Anna is a girl & needs to learn how to manage boys. It's sick.", "You keep saying that like there was nothing that you, the adult in charge, could do about it. Have you noticed that you are much bigger than he is? It\u2019s good you don\u2019t have 2 kids. Fighting & grabbing other kids is a thing some kids do, and then a responsible adult would step in & put a stop to it without throwing the grabber out of the house. If you don\u2019t know how to be an authority figure & either convince or force a defiant child to what you told them, you 1) should never agree to babysit anyone else\u2019s kid, and 2) are going to have a rough time as a parent when your own kid acts out.", "You're the adult, your job is to control the children. Sounds like you let the inmates run the asylum. YTA.", "You allowed a 5-year-old child to physically dominate the encounter? That's your failure as a babysitter, big time.  \n\n\nIf your sister's attitude makes it unfeasible for you to be a decent babysitter, you should tell her so and not babysit him anymore.", "Thank you!", "No it's not that hard. It's a 5 year old not handcuffs.", "Really.... then thinking ahead and not putting the children in that situation in the 1st place would be ideal. Don't you think?   Have her daughter in another room right of the bat, re-direct the nephew initially, and then keep them separate.... seriously. The lack of parenting is astounding if her child is that critical..... this falls squarely on her as a parent and not able to control the situation and not be able to recognize her own limitations, putting her own child at risk.", "I feel like I need to say it out loud. If only I could to mom and sis. Rape. Assault.", "She is apart of the village by literally paying back her debt. You don\u2019t get to hold the shit you did for people over their head when they are paying you back in literal cash for the money you lent. It\u2019s not something to be used to get people to do what you want. Which is exactly what the sister and her nephew did. Her nephew had zero place telling her her kid needed to play with him because his mommy paid her, and he had zero place putting his hands on her daughter because he wanted her to play. It doesnt matter if she gave money for her niece, that money is being repaid back. And the terms for the money didn\u2019t come with \u2018I\u2019ll give this to you and you also baby sit for me while repaying me\u2019. That fact that you think giving money to someone who is actively repaying you, means you can now go \u2018well I gave you money the least you can do is watch my kid\u2019 is acceptable, you\u2019re a shit person to have in the village. \n\nShe has a child with extremely specific needs right now and her nephew was not respecting them. Her first priority is HER CHILD especially during the recovery process. You want your kid baby sat by people? Don\u2019t throw the help you offered them and are being paid back for in their face, and ensure your own child knows to respect rules in place for a child that\u2019s recovering from surgery.", "I think the chance to handle it is gone once one kid starts physically touching the other. I guess you might try to offer him all the candy and ice cream that he wants just to separate them but that would be my last time to babysit. Also it\u2019s unclear if OP knew there was an important meeting but I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that to be communicated and for the parent to have a back up plan with another adult available. What if Anna suddenly had a complication and needed to go to the hospital?", "As a former pre-k and kindergarten educator, if one child is physically latching onto another and risking harming them (as was the case here) we called for backup.  You do not try to pry a child off an injured one and risk the injury.  You cannot risk that he will hurt the other child in his tantrum by pulling her stitches.  It's not about what he said, it's a bout safety.", "Anna still has scars from her surgery that are not fully healed. I am not risking my daughters health and life if one of the stitches comes undone and we need to go to the hospital because of it. And Kyle was grabbing her in exact places where some of the scars are. \n\nMy sister didn't ask me to babysit him, just keep an eye while they play as she said she would be back in an hour and knows about my daughter still recovering.", "I was not babysitting him. She asked me to look after him and said she will be back in an hour, which was fine with me since Anna haven't seen Kyle for a while. My sister ended up being longer and Kyle was holding on my daughter who still was healing from operation. She still had fresh scars from the operation and the last thing I want is one of the stitches to become undone as it would result in another emergency trip to the hospital.", "Yeah. That is exactly where my mind went!\n\nSad to think my mind went there so strongly with a 5 year old. But these are the lessons his mother is teaching him. \n\nShe is saying he is absolutely entitled to someone\u2019s time and body once they have paid something! Ie - one drink! \n\nHow can that mother and sister be so blatantly blind to what they are teaching a kid. Hopefully schooling and consent lessons will teach him differently! But hard to un-teach some lessons taught at home!", "I used to work with kids. Not as teacher/caregiver but at a hella fancy arcade. Only one kid could play a specific game at a time and I was constantly having to stop boys from grabbing girls and moving them out of the way. \n\nAnd every time the boy-mom would make this shocked pikachu face and be like \u201che\u2019s just a child\u201d. And I\u2019d have to be like, \u201cMa\u2019am, she is also a child. And it is her turn right now.\u201d \n\nWhile internally screaming that she is at the very least raising her child to be a misogynist if not a sexual predator.", "How is that not babysitting? That's exactly babysitting.", "That\u2019s kind of the definition of babysitting.", "How is this your response to OP saying that she was worried about Anna\u2019s stitches? \u201cIf you were a good babysitter you\u2019d be less concerned about your daughter\u2019s health\u201d is not the gotcha you seem to think it is."]}
