Her father is not in the picture and I'm raising her with the help of my grandma (to be clear me and Anna live in her house and I help her around the house and with bills, and she looks after Anna while I'm working).\n\nAbout a month ago Anna had a very complicated operation, this is for a condition she had since she was born and operation essentially saved her life. However I had to borrow money from family including my sister to make sure the operation would go ahead and I am paying it back slowly. The operation has a long recovery period, the doctors said it might take up to 6 months for her to be back to normal. Due to this Anna gets tired really quickly, especially after active play time. Because she is recovering she can take naps and sleep as much as she needs, I have also made sure to break the main meals into 6-8 smaller meals so it is easier to eat, as recently she found eating boring because it takes too long.\n\nShe has friends visiting her and the rule with them and their parents is that if Anna gets tired they move into less active activities like watching a cartoon or reading which they can understand and have been complying with without issues.\n\nThursday my sister came around with her son and asked me to look after him for a bit as something came up at work. She knows about Anna recovering and needing rest and assured me it was for an hour or 2. My nephew \"Kyle\" is 5 and as soon as he got into the house he wanted to play with Anna. My grandma wasn't home as she had to visit a friend so I was looking after them. After about an hour Anna has mentioned she was tired and wanted to watch some cartoons on Disney, but Kyle still wanted to play and didn't want to watch \"girly\" cartoons, he wanted to keep playing. I have told Anna she can go to her room and watch it there and I will look after Kyle, but he didn't want to let go of Anna and kept insisting she must play with him since \"his mummy paid us\". That didn't sit well with me and he was throwing a tantrum refusing to accept that Anna needs rest, so I called my sister and told her to pick Kyle up immediately.\n\nMy sister did show up but she wasn't happy and called me an asshole since she was in an important meeting, and I could have sucked it up since she loaned me money for Anna's operation, so it is the least I could have done. After this I have asked her to leave.\n\nLater that day I received a call from my mum saying I was an asshole too and shouldn't have asked my sister to pick up Kyle since its just her looking after him as Kyle's dad is in military and currently away.\n\nEdit: as a lot of people seem to be missing out, Kyle latched onto Anna and would not let her go. He was holding her making her unable to rest until she carries on playing with him, making her really stressed. I have tried take her from him and bring to the bedroom but he would not let her go at all. And I didn't want to risk him hurting her since her scars from operation are still fresh and only recently started to heal properly.", "created_utc": 1673129283, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106161y/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_immedietly_pick_up/", "score": 2622, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You got mad because of his smartass remark and took it out on your sister.\n\nYour sister is only an asshole because she shouldn't be talking about loaning you money to her 5yo, what is that about? Kids that age don't need that kind of detail about finances.", "YTA. What I read her is that you can\u2019t manage a 5 year old for 2 or 3 hours or don\u2019t want to go to the trouble. I get that your kid needed her rest & the 5 year old grabbed her. Big deal. You are the adult. What would you do if you were at the playground & some kid you didn\u2019t know grabbed your daughter? I bet you would separate them pretty quick. 5 year olds throw tantrums & mouth off. What are you going to do when Anna throws one & there\u2019s no one else to call?  What if your grandma called you out of work when she was watching Anna because Anna was rude to her?", "NTA but if your sister is going to throw the fact she gave you money in your face, I\u2019d never ask her for anything ever again and go LC/NC.", "NTA She would be the first person I would pay off if she is going to use this excuse \u201cthat it\u2019s the least you can do\u201d to have her throw that up in your face that would end it there.

Surely you could have come up with some creative ways or further enforced the boundaries. Heck, I bet if you told Kyle to sit down with a bowl full of candy and chips, and let your daughter go in her room, she would have. I think your sister would have understood given the circumstances. \n\nYTA here for not learning to properly manage the behaviours of children while being a parent of your own.", "Kyle is a 5 year old child. It can be hard, but having a 5 year old right NOW, you can 100% pull empathy and reasoning into them. You lost an opportunity here to help your nephew, your sister and quite frankly your own child. You could have spent more time walking her through setting her own boundaries.\n\n5 year olds are simple. You absolutely could have helped him stopped focusing on losing an activity, having him understand and then helping him find a new appropriate activity.\n\nI\u2019m glad your daughter is going to be ok, but you need to tread lightly moving forward with her being able to be able to kick anyone out whenever she wants. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s happening, what I\u2019m saying is it can build poor coping skills and entitlement. A better approach for a play date is to talk to her about that length of time. \u201cCan you do 1 hour today?\u201d If so she needs to be held to not removing her friends for that hour because THEYRE ALSO CHILDREN. After that hour mark she can end the playdate or reevaluate if she feels up to more.\n\nFinally tho: your sister. How dare she say that to her son. Fuck that noise. If she would like you to pay back through childcare that conversation needs to be had in private and kept away from the kids. Period.", "NTA. But you can\u2019t control a kid? No means no. Take Anna in the bedroom and close the door and he can continue playing on his own.", "ESH.\n\nYTA because you got mad at a 5 year old throwing a tantrum. That's what 3-5 year olds do! It's part of their development. I'm also rather critical of your daughter's media consumption, but let's put that aside. You agreed to watching over him so she can work, but the moment he annoys you, he's out? Imagine your grandma doing the same to you while you'reat work.\n\nYour sister is an asshole for guilting you with the money she lent you and for apparently pointing that out in private so much that even her 5 year old picked it up.", "You were incapable of setting a simple boundary with a 5yo? Nah, you wrangle a kid who doesn't enjoy her limitations like a boss. So you just didn't feel like babysitting. YTA.", "Kind of sounds like ESH. Your sister for using the loan as leverage, and for apparently talking abt you and the loan behind your back (I can\u2019t think of any other reason her 5yo would make a comment like that); your mother for inserting herself into an issue that is clearly between you and your sister; and you a little bit for just defaulting to making your sister pick him up instead of taking authority and putting him on a timeout. 5 is a bit too old to be throwing temper tantrums without some consequences. If it wasn\u2019t work I would have probably done the same, but if my sister was at work and her kid was behaving like a brat I would just suck it up until she was done.", "I\u2019m need a No One is the Asshole.

I don\u2019t think anyone was particularly TA, they all just had different expectation of what was going to happen", "How old are you?  YTA/ ESH.... you're a parent, start parenting. Let your 6 yr old daughter go rest, and take your 5 yr old nephew outside, play a game, or cook something.... seriously, anything other than what you did.

You\u2019re an adult and the boy is 5. Pretty sure you can get him off your daughter and manage to separate the two. Single people care for multiple kids all the time safely but it sounds like you just didn\u2019t want to put in the effort Your sister should have been able to count on you, regardless of the money, especially since it was for work and not to go shopping or something frivolous.", "Wow, you got punked by a 5 year old.  You need to put on your big girl panties and lay down the\n law.", "YTA it\u2019s not that hard to manage a 5 year old in order to help your sister out.

Maybe the sister was rude about the money, but that was after you called her to pick her son up immediately as if he's a maniac that cannot be dealt with. She was rude, but your rejection of your nephew was too. Sometimes helping out your family with their kids means they won't be perfect, as yours wouldn't be with them as well, but they trust you to handle the situation as an adult instead of villainizing a literal child and acting helpless. Yeah, sounds like he was being a brat but putting up with our family members unique quirks and helping shape your nieces and nephews positively is part of loving your family, otherwise you are expecting to be handed a perfect child, which is honestly unreasonable. This doesn't sound like anything outside the bounds that I would expect to possibly put up with watching a family members child, they might even throw a fit!

There is no need to put her in danger from normal kid behavior. \n\nI'm sure in a couple weeks, it will be healed enough for this not to be a concern. \n\nBut, whatever your sister is saying while you are not around is clearly an issue if her son said that comment about money.

Just because your sister helped you out doesn't entitle Kyle into treating Anna like his personal toy.", "NTA", "I might be in the minority but I think YTA a little bit, but I need to know more about the sister\u2019s situation.  Does she have a husband or anyone else able to help her with her son?  Do you often watch her son or was this a one time thing?\n\nKinda seems like you get the \u201cit takes a village\u201d treatment, and she\u2019s part of the village that helps you, but she\u2019s not getting the same in return.  It shouldn\u2019t be tit for tat but from the sounds of this, you were asked to watch her son on one occasion when something with work- a job that enabled your daughter to get the care she needs- came up. You seem to get the benefit of grandma, family support, etc.  But when your sister needs help she gets the short end of the stick. \n\nThe kids are about the same age- I guess I just don\u2019t understand how a little bit of separation and time out would not have solved the five year old trying to play with his cousin. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that in the world we live in you can be fired for leaving work early for child related obligations.  But if she gets fired because you couldn\u2019t watch her kid for a few hours, I hope you\u2019re prepared to pay her back very quickly.", "Your sister is not paying you. You borrowed money and will pay it back but that doesn't mean you work for them nor you have to babysit for them whenever they want. \nYour nephew is just repeating what he heard at home. He might not understand why your daughter needs to rest. Maybe your sister doesn't get it either. You really need to talk to her and explain how the recovery process works. \n\nNTA.", "NTA: and OP I did catch that Kyle said \u201cmum is paying you\u201d. He\u2019s five FFS so you KNOW your sister has been talking like this for him to be repeating it. Somehow Kyle has caught the drift that you OWE THEM SERVITUDE. She may not have literally said that but he caught that vibe.  \n\nI can understand why sis would be tweaked at needing to leave a meeting. \n\nBut Kyle doesn\u2019t need to be exhausting your daughter like she OWES him. That attitude needs nipping in the bud.  \n\nThis will take ginger diplomacy to navigate and I do think y\u2019all need to sit down and hear each other out. \n\nhowever your daughters safety has to be number one priority.", "Yeah.. this. I don't care if she loaned you money. That's not carte blanche to be entitled.", "I disagree that the only way to separate the kids was to hurt kyle. There are definitely ways to convey to a five-year-old that he had better let go of your daughter or else! OP seriously needs to learn these techniques!", "I guarantee, Kyle's parents see absolutely nothing wrong with his behavior. They think he's a fine, strapping specimen who will rule the world one day. It is up to OP to step up, no matter how scary it is, and let this kid know who's boss in her home!", "Totally! I said this in my comment originally, and I know by today's standards that probably sounds harsh, but there may be a time in the future when the little girl is better and able to interact for a longer period of time, and she may encounter this type of kid elsewhere. Every parent needs to know how to protect their kid physically. You can't just leave it up to the other kid's parents to get in there and do the right thing. All of us know that's kind of a fantasy. AHs raise little AHs!", ">Your sister loaned you money when you really neede\n\n*you mean to help save the childs life???*\n\nThere is no possible way you can be sitting there with a straight face and saying that OPs sister is allowed to lord this loan over them, especially since it wasn't a loan for a movie ticket or groceries. It was a loan to *save a childs life*. It is beyond messed up to act like this is even close to an appropriate situation to hold a favor hostage", "But this wasn't a playdate for Anna,  OP was expected babysitting the nephew for free!\nNTA", "OP stated she has paid back 3.5k of the 5k already. She\u2019s not ungrateful her sister is an AH", "True question tho, I don\u2019t get the downvotes and am genuinely curious. To me it doesn\u2019t feel like the story would be different if \u00ab\u00a0Anna\u00a0\u00bb was a boy.", "Kyles behavior is misogynistic for a few reasons; \n\n- the calling of cartoons \u201cgirly\u201d as if that is a bad thing and that he shouldn\u2019t have to participate in that activity because it\u2019s \u201cgirly\u201d. Using girly as an insult equates being feminine or a girl as lesser\n\n- the grabbiness towards his cousin. Because Anna didn\u2019t want to continue playing he physically prevented her from leaving asserting his wants trump his cousins needs\n\n- the statement of \u201cmy mom paid u therefore I get to keep playing\u201d. This is obviously from his mother but his mother is teaching him that if he pays a fee or favor then he is entitled to someone else as if they\u2019re a commodity \n\nObviously Kyle is still very very young but these small behaviors if not corrected can grow into a very alarming pattern as he grows older", "Nah, kyle\u2019s behavior is scary and concerning", "\u201cAH\u2019s raise little AH\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udcaf", "So what did he do after calling the sister? Sit patiently and let the kid keep latched on to her? He had to separate them either way.", "Holy shit, Kyle is a demon child\n\nI think your sister and mother are spoiling him rotten, this absolutely reeks of entitled child and entitled mother", "Anybody else getting \"We Don't Talk About Kevin\" vibes from Kyle?", "Right, so she lent you pocket change, you\u2019ve paid most of it back, and she still sees you as the help.", "Did you miss the part where he is five? Not to be rude but give year olds are very small... Their easy too scoop up.\n\nNot saying she should have too and I agree calling the sister is acceptable I'm just saying I can kinda see the point of few  because he's just a little kid", "I'm currently out of coins, but consider this \u2764\ufe0f a much deserved award for that great answer.", "I'm disgusted that the 5-year-old said that to you before his mother did. You need to look after Anna first, That's what you were doing when you borrowed money for her surgery and when you called your sister to come to take her child.", "Exactly, like yes sometimes kids can be selfish little so and so's (ie like not wanting to take turns on the swings in the park or stuff like that), but all kids can be and it's up to their parents to parent it out of them and teach them empathy etc, but kids, especially 5yos don't come up with stuff like \"she has to do what I want because my mum paid you\" on their own. They've heard that from someone repeatedly enough for them to repeat it .\n\nPlus look at OPs sister's words the minute she stepped into OPs house \"you could have sucked it up since I loaned you the money for your daughter's operation\". That's exactly where OPs nephew has been learning it.", "Cause he is demanding her to play & not watch girly cartoons. He grabbed hold on her & wouldn\u2019t let go", "Yet another reason to go no contact", "Thanks!", "Have you ever pried a child off another child? It\u2019s very a physically involved process. Have you ever had major surgery? Physically those surgeries take a long time to recover and by trying to physically remove Kyle from Anna would have risked opening her incision(s)", "You are doing right, family means supporting each other in needs. Especially medical situations. It says charity begins at home. And if we can afford it we should choose to save a little life by helping with money. Not to give them a loan and burden them like we bought them.", "The \u201cmummy paid\u201d vs it being a loan is gross. Was free childcare and allowing her daughter to be abused the \u201cinterest\u201d on the loan? \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with these people (mom and sis)? \n\nAlso what the fuck is wrong with our country that OP couldn\u2019t get life-saving surgery for a 4-year old without becoming indebted to shitty family members? Maybe OP should have gone the trusty American GoFundMe route instead\u2026(/s because neither option is okay. No one should have to beg others for money in order for a hospital to agree to provide necessary surgery).", "Your mother is an asshole, don't listen to anything she has to say\n\nIt looks like your sister takes after her too", "I'm so sorry for your loss and about the stress you went through with your sick baby girl. Your sis and mother are the a-holes.\n\nWho calls a little baby and defective and says that she should have been left at the hospital. Your sister must be loudmouth and saying things in front of her 5 years old about loaning you money.\n\nHow else a 5 years old know that she loaned money to you and you owe them time according to their wishes. You don't owe them anything dear apart from their money.\n\nMake a repayment plan if it's not done already. Make it clear for your sister that you owe her nothing except for the payments which you can pay however is easier for you. And no to use the loaned money as an excuse to have you do things you don't want to do.\n\nNTA, but your sis and mother definitely are TAH.", "Oh friend. You have it bad. I am so glad grandma is there for you. Do what is best for you and you poor kid and screw the rest.", "So what exactly happened then? He waited patiently for the sister to make her way over, letting the kid latch on to his recovering daughter the whole time and letting him risk reopening the wounds? YTA if so. Or he actually was capable of separating them, and called the sister away from her meeting because he didn't want to handle the kid anymore after agreeing to watch him and letting a five year old push him around. YTA in that scenario too.", "If i told my brother I'd watch his kid for an important meeting, I would do what I said. Pretending to be overpowered by a 5 year old is ridiculous. The comment from the kid was awful, but you deal with that after like an adult. Clearly lots of people in here aren't actually parents.", "How can you tell they are a bot?", "The answer should be \"Your child needs to learn manners on how to be around girls\"...", "No one claimed to be over powered by a 5 year old \ud83d\ude0c\n\nI really hope your not a parent \ud83d\ude02 because if so\u2026.ouch. \n\nI most likely have more experience with kids than you so the irony here is hilarious. \n\nGlad to know that you\u2019d willingly hurt one of your kids if you were in this situation though. Great parenting \ud83d\udc4d", "Maybe OP was thinking babysitting involves getting paid.", "I have two kids. I can remove one from a situation without hurting them. It's amazing, actually.", "And I\u2019ve been raising my siblings since I was 10, babysitting since I was 16, and then working in daycares and private governess jobs for the past 5 years. \nI could usually remove one from a situation without hurting anyone but I\u2019m also not arrogant enough to believe that would be the case in every situation. \n\n\nOkay then \nso a kid has latched onto your kid who\u2019s already injured and refuses to let go. \nWhat is your next step \ud83d\ude02", "Ah, so you aren't a parent, and you're lecturing me from your babysitting experience. Got it. I had one kid born 10 weeks early. I know what it's like dealing with trauma from a difficult childhood, so you acting like you have all this experience in this arena is a bit comical. \n\nAs to what i would do? I would literally open their hands and physically remove them. While holding them, I would have my daughter go to her room to rest. I would then set the other child down to explain why that was not appropriate, and I would give other ideas on what we could do together. This seriously isn't complicated. I can see how it would be more stressful from the eyes of an employee, but parents deal with this stuff every single day.", "Exactly, You just admitted that Ive had more experience with more kids in more situations than you. \nAs well as actual higher education in caring for children. \nI spent almost 2 years getting my diploma and over 13 years of caring for children in general but \nyour criteria for knowing how to deal with kids better than me is that you pumped your load into someone and therefore are a good parent? \ud83d\ude02 doesn\u2019t work that way. \n\nBy your own logic then anyone who pops out and raises a kid knows what their doing and shouldn\u2019t be criticised which obviously isn\u2019t the case. \n\nSo basically you would get physical and try to pry one kid off the other very likely injuring one or both in the process. Great strategy \ud83d\udc4d \n\nAs a parent you\u2019d know that kids have quite a strong grip and that when they don\u2019t wanna let go of something they will also dig in their nails. \nTrying to physically pry one hand would also cause most kids to try and grab again with their other hand as soon you start doing that. \nI genuinely fail to see how your plan wouldn\u2019t hurt at least one of the kids."]}
