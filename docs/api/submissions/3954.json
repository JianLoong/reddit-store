It is a complete and utter disregard for your boundaries and no good can come from that. Maybe he was used to and ok with people coming over when he lived in his own place but that's not the case anymore and he has to start respecting that your comfort matters too. \n\nI mean honestly you just gave a very fair consequence for an unannounced visit even if you didn't realize that's what you were doing.

It's disrespectful.", "OP, you were ambused by your BF's family. You are absoltely fine to say you have other plans for your day that didn't include a surprise visit from your BFs family. If your BF cares about you he will understand that you need for family visits from his side to not be \"suprises\" especially if he want's you to enjoy them. Not everyone appreciates unexpected and unannounced company. \n\nI get it my husband came from a family of \"dropper in--ers.\" That didn't work for me, and we made comprimises. His family always gave us a heads up, at least 20 mins and they didn't expect me to drop everything to entertain them if they dropped in.

Thing.", "NTA\n\nIf bf had respected your boundary request this would be N A H, but he didn't.\n\nDifferent families have different norms. Some are used to the \"dropping by\" framework and it's \"normal\" and they do it and have it done to them and it's seen as a \"why wouldn't you want me to come by?\". Other families need 3-5 business days notice to physically, mentally, and emotionally prepare. There are plenty people somewhere in between.\n\nIt sounds like your bf comes from the first family culture where \"give me notice\" is heard as \"I don't really want you here\". You come from the other one, where it's considered common courtesy to give notice.\n\nYou tried to establish a boundary and he didn't respect it or try to even work with it. Even if he doesn't understand it, he should still work with it.  Neither culture is wrong, but it's appropriate to match the one of the host. If someone wants notice, give them notice.\n\nMaybe talk to him about it in these terms and try to come up with a specific solution (e.g. he asks his dad to call when he's leaving the house so you have 2 hours to prep, or he calls the night before). And maybe talk to him about arranging actual planned get togethers with his dad where you all actively invite him at a planned time.", "NTA\n\nI understand where your BF and his dad comes from. My family are like that. We drop by unannounced all the time. I don't mind. But none of us expect anyone to drop everything. In fact, if we drop unannounced, you are within your right to not let us in. It's fine, it's no big deal. \n\nI understand dropping by unannounced is a big deal to others and I am fine to be the AH.

Took me about five minutes, but I arranged 'prior plans' and left them sitting in the living room all day, and the next day for good measure.
