They should give you a solid heads up of a day or at least a few hours.", "NTA\n\nIf they don't call and ask if you have plans, then you have no obligation to spend your time with them.", "NTA it's very rude to show up unannounced like that and demand people structure their day around you. Though I don't really see what you owning the house vs not owning the house has to do with that.", "NTA and it's a good idea to have a serious sit down with your bf about this. It is a complete and utter disregard for your boundaries and no good can come from that. Maybe he was used to and ok with people coming over when he lived in his own place but that's not the case anymore and he has to start respecting that your comfort matters too. \n\nI mean honestly you just gave a very fair consequence for an unannounced visit even if you didn't realize that's what you were doing. If the behavior continues without being addressed it is going to cause resentment and anger towards his family and possibly damage the relationship irreperably. God help you IF you decide to have kids and this behavior is still happening because that's a surefire way to blow up a relationship. Good luck OP.", "Nta \n\nI asked my almost inlaws to not come by unnanounced. Told them short notice was fine just please text or call first. \n\nThey couldnt respect that. I stopped answering the door. \n\"oh sorry, I was in the shower\" everytime.", "NTA, and both of you need to learn to say no.\n\nYou're adults and it's YOUR house. They don't get to demand to just show up. Let them sit outside with your doors locked if necessary.\n\nQuit appeasing their rude and disrespectful behavior.", "NTA\n\nThat would piss me off as well. It's disrespectful.", "OP, you were ambused by your BF's family. You are absoltely fine to say you have other plans for your day that didn't include a surprise visit from your BFs family. If your BF cares about you he will understand that you need for family visits from his side to not be \"suprises\" especially if he want's you to enjoy them. Not everyone appreciates unexpected and unannounced company. \n\nI get it my husband came from a family of \"dropper in--ers.\" That didn't work for me, and we made comprimises. His family always gave us a heads up, at least 20 mins and they didn't expect me to drop everything to entertain them if they dropped in. Also, as a couple we didn't \"drop in\" even if he did it on his own with his family. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell your boyfriend next weekend randomly your parents just called, they\u2019re on the way over, and have the day\u2019s itinerary all planned out doing (things he doesn\u2019t like) shopping, whatever.  When he pouts or objects, say\u2026just kidding, you know they would never dream of doing this, but you\u2019re saying I need to suck it up when your dad constantly does\u2026This. Very. Thing.", "NTA\n\nIf bf had respected your boundary request this would be N A H, but he didn't.\n\nDifferent families have different norms. Some are used to the \"dropping by\" framework and it's \"normal\" and they do it and have it done to them and it's seen as a \"why wouldn't you want me to come by?\". Other families need 3-5 business days notice to physically, mentally, and emotionally prepare. There are plenty people somewhere in between.\n\nIt sounds like your bf comes from the first family culture where \"give me notice\" is heard as \"I don't really want you here\". You come from the other one, where it's considered common courtesy to give notice.\n\nYou tried to establish a boundary and he didn't respect it or try to even work with it. Even if he doesn't understand it, he should still work with it.  Neither culture is wrong, but it's appropriate to match the one of the host. If someone wants notice, give them notice.\n\nMaybe talk to him about it in these terms and try to come up with a specific solution (e.g. he asks his dad to call when he's leaving the house so you have 2 hours to prep, or he calls the night before). And maybe talk to him about arranging actual planned get togethers with his dad where you all actively invite him at a planned time.", "NTA\n\nI understand where your BF and his dad comes from. My family are like that. We drop by unannounced all the time. I don't mind. But none of us expect anyone to drop everything. In fact, if we drop unannounced, you are within your right to not let us in. It's fine, it's no big deal. \n\nI understand dropping by unannounced is a big deal to others and I am fine to be the AH. It sounds like your BF doesn't understand, though. Are you sure his dad minds?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's common courtesy to give a heads-up before dropping by to give you ample time to get ready. What ample time is depends on what your comfortable with and varies from person to person so this is a discussion you might want to have with your boyfriend to prevent a repeat.", "NTA.\n\nAs this sounds like a real issue for you, you may have to start calling BFs father every morning to see if he's stopping by. **Preferably at 4am.** If they don't respect your boundaries this may force them to understand your setting some.", "NTA for being upset with him coming unannounced. Also, just tell him yourself; no need to ask your bf to do that. You're an adult and your bf may feel uncomfortable since it's his dad. \n\nHowever, how you wrote that last part does make me think you may have delivered your upset feelings in a bit of a petulant way? It's fine for you being annoyed and now wanting to go have lunch, but how you deliver that will 100% impact whether people take you seriously/hear you. \n\nAlso, please don't hold you owning the house over your bfs head. If my partner would do that, that would undoubtedly be the start of the end.", "NTA. Boundaries are healthy. Perhaps speak with FIL directly. In an engaging , but clear way ?", "NTA. \n\nThis is a weird control thing parents do.", "NTA. I really think AH is a strong word for a situation like that. I fell like I\u2019m just like you. I\u2019m not spontaneous and I always plan my days and every time my husband just gets a new idea and it\u2019s really stressing me out. I\u2019m not the type of person who can do change moods like that but I don\u2019t really consider this to be one of my good qualities. So I count it as a negative. But your boyfriend should be more understanding. It\u2019s perfectly fine if he goes alone with his dad for a lunch. He\u2019s a grown up boy he doesn\u2019t need you 24/7 to hold his hand. Not sure why he\u2019s mad.", "NTA. They are both out of line.", "NTA. He is going to be even angrier when you decide to tell his dad he can't show up unannounced. Do it anyway.", "Nta but you do need to talk to your bf. Either him and his dad are clueless or they are testing you. You need to clarify that before deciding what to do about it.", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t go either. I like to mentally know where my day is going and so I wouldn\u2019t be a fan of someone randomly showing up to my house and expecting me to go along with their plans.", "Your BF definitely needs to ask his father to call before coming. He might want to word it gently like you might not be home, have other plans, be ill, etc.   \n\n\nMany families don't think twice, even though it's poor etiquette, to go to another family member's home without calling first.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you and boyfriend have to talk about things. At least the dad called before arriving. Some people don\u2019t even give you that. \n\nBoyfriend shouldn\u2019t expect you to go hang out at a moments notice and embed shouldn\u2019t get mad when you stay behind. He should know you by now, meaning that you like to make plans in advance. He should also respect that. You shouldn\u2019t worry about cleaning up when his family shows up like that. Cleaning up for his family should be BF\u2019s job. \n\nBF and his family obviously do things differently from how you and your family do, he needs to acknowledge and accept that. Neither is right or wrong. Just different.", "NTA\n\nYour bf needs to step up and inform his dad that showing up unannounced is not a good thing.\n\nAlso that you have a life outside of him and his family that still goes on regardless of them not being able to be polite and informing you that they are coming.", "ESH.  They are being rude and you are a grown adult who needs to discuss this with them, calmly and rationally. Nothing prevents you from explaining that you prefer to have notice of visits. If you haven't said anything, how would they know you have a problem with it?", "They should ASK.", "It\u2019s *her* house that other people are intruding on her in. \n\nIf it were her *boyfriend\u2019s* house she could see the entitlement of the extremely rude family, but it\u2019s not even his house.", "THIS. NTA, but you both need to get on the same page and enforce boundaries with his parents.", "But she did, she tells the BF every time it happens. He either ignores her and doesn\u2019t even tell his family or his family ignores her. \n\nFrankly, I expect my partner to deal with their family and show that we are a team. He\u2019s the one they have to love, not me. Luckily, this isn\u2019t an issue often but I don\u2019t want to always be the bad cop.", "Correct. That\u2019s what I meant when I said give a heads up. Kind of like \u2018hey, we were thinking about coming for a visit tomorrow or later today. Does that work for you guys?\u2019", "Only on the lease. She acknowledged that her boyfriend pays his half of it so he's more of a roommate / co owner and less of a freeloader or whatever.", "I wasn\u2019t saying he was a freeloader. \nI was answering a question on why it might be important to OP to mention. \n\nPaying rent **in no way** makes him a co-owner.", " It states he pays some bills and stuff so it feels like it ours. That's what she said.", "Yes. True. Therefor he should be able to hang out with his dad if he wants. She shouldn't have to hang out with them though which was never my point. Anyways communication and setting boundaries would be best here and not just going 'uhh I own the house so fuck off' if you want a good relationship."]}
