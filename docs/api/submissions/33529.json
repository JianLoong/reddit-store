We currently moved to a new city because of my boyfriend\u2019s job promotion (I freelance) and are in the middle of settling down. Nara and I get along very well.\n\nNara plays tennis. Since the move, she\u2019s been in the school team and competed a bit. The parents of her teammates often organize some kind of get together and her father and I tried our best to have her attend most of them. I would say Nara got along well with all her teammates and I thought the parents were friendly. Last week the team captain\u2019s parents hosted a potluck party at their place.\n\nNara and I brought over some brownies. There really was a lot of all kinds of food. The team captain\u2019s father did most of the greeting telling us his wife was preparing something special for us all. Once everyone was at the party, the wife came out of the kitchen with a special dish, a recipe of a specific country.\n\nNow, Nara looks white but her late mother actually came from that very country. The wife host began to serve everyone and share her recipe and ingredients and how it was \u201cnot that difficult to make once you substitute the local ingredients\u201d and feel free to ask her for tips.\n\nAt this point Nara spoke up, saying that the authentic recipes included such and such and how their particular scent and taste added to the whole experience of eating the dish. She said if so many substitutes were used, they may as well call the dish a different name. The wife host looked a little unsettled and told Nara that she and her husband traveled a lot in their youth and she had the dish many times and knew what it was supposed to taste like and the substituted ingredients work just fine. Nara then said her mom was from the dish\u2019s country of origin and she understood that some ingredients were hard to come by but substituting so much turned the dish into something else altogether.\n\nDuring all this I mostly kept silent. Nara was not being rude, just matter of fact, and as this was a matter of her heritage I thought she could speak up. The host wife spluttered a bit before saying everyone should just go ahead and enjoy her dish, no matter the name. Everyone tried though nobody asked for seconds (I personally thought it was a little bland) and there was a lot of leftovers.\n\nNara\u2019s team captain later called her, thanking her for putting her \u201cannoying stepmom in her place.\u201d When my boyfriend came back from his business trip and learned of this, however, he thought I should have reprimanded Nara for being rude to the host. He also had a talk with Nara and she seemed to be sulking a bit though she was not grounded or anything.

Being a gracious guest is a skill everyone should learn. Was your stepdaughter technically right? Probably. But she made the host uncomfortable unnecessarily. I get that it may be a pain point for her, given her mother passed away, but she was actually being rude. The host wanted to share something with her guests that she obviously was proud of, and your stepdaughter called her out in front of everyone.", "YTA. Nara was extremely rude. This woman opened up her home and spent time and money  to prepare this meal. Nara trashed it before she was ate it. Maybe you and Nara don\u2019t realize this but there are different ways to prepare a cultural dish. Not everyone in a particular culture prepares their food the exact same way. Maybe the dish tastes similarly to the way it was prepared when the hostess ate it during her travels. Your stepdaughter needs to learn graciousness and respect. \n\nIf I pulled something like this when I was her age, my mom would make me write an apology letter to the mom. Then she would volunteer our family to host the next team get together and make me do all of the cooking by myself so I would learn to have respect for people who invite me into their home and prepare a meal for me. The team captain is also an ungrateful brat. If her stepmom is so annoying, she needs to handle the hosting duties for these gatherings herself.", "YTA. \n\nAnd you can bet Nara won't be invited to anymore team events. She is a guest. \"Matter of fact\" is just a polite way to say rude. \n\nNara could have said \"When I had it the chef used X, Y, and Z.\" Or \"I have never had it with local ingredients.\" and left it at that. But it is rude to comment on the dish before it has even been eaten and then said comments should have been made privately and to her parents, not to the host. Thank you. Thank you is what you say to the host.", "\"You're not wrong, you're just an asshole\"\n\nNara needs to learn some manners and respect. And you should be intervening in these situations, and speaking to her afterwards.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. Even if you're right, it's in poor taste to correct someone's recipe when she invited you to her home and cooked for you, especially in front of everyone. Nara is a child, so she might not understand, but as the adult, you should have intervened. The fact that the team captain called and thanked Nara for \"putting her stepmother in her place\" only shows it was humiliating for that woman.\n\nThis could harm Nara because that woman may talk to other parents about Nara's lack of manners, making others unwilling to invite her to their homes.", "\"I'm just being honest\" is a poor excuse for being rude.\n\nCandor is being forthcoming in what you say. Respect is being considerate in how you say it.\n\nBeing direct with the content of your feedback doesn't prevent you from being thoughtful about the best way to deliver it.", "YTA- Although she was correct, she was a guest. She needs to learn to conduct herself accordingly.", "Im going to go against the grain and say NTA. It sounds like thr host had butchered the food the country as from and trying to sound as if she knew a lot about it when she didn't. The host sounds tiresome and entitled. Yes ots important to be civil and courteous as a guest but that doesn't mean to be silent when someone is proudly butchering your food. Also this line\n\n>Nara\u2019s team captain later called her, thanking her for putting her \u201cannoying stepmom in her place.\u201d\n\nMakes it sound like the host does thisbon a regular.

The gatekeeping of food is super annoying. \n\nAnd who knows, maybe the wife did travel somewhere and have a variation of the dish your daughter isn't familiar with.", "Mmmm I'm not gonna vote either way.\n\n\n\nIt IS rude, but also it is fair to point out when someone is making claims that are incorrect.\n\n\n\nYou should have intervened, and said they can discuss the recipe later, let's all eat now.\n\n\nThe woman sounds pretentious, and likes they idea that she knows 'exotic' stuff from her super interesting travels... But in reality she's watered down and changed things so it's easy but she can still brag about the travel", "The audacity of showing up at someone's house, who cooked for you and you let an entitled little 12 year old brat criticize the host?? Yeah, you and your stepdaughter YTA", "[removed]", "Think the issue here isn\u2019t the \u201cwhat\u201d but the \u201chow.\u201dGentle YTA for not having stepped in to help her navigate the situation and make her point in a gracious manner that\u2019s also respectful of her heritage. But it\u2019s wonderful to hear how well you\u2019re getting along with your boyfriend\u2019s daughter.", "NTA. OP\u2019s daughter was right. The host could have presented the dish in a different manner and nothing would have been said. All she had to say was the dish was inspired by one of their favorites but it isn\u2019t as good as the original as they couldn\u2019t find the local ingredients. Instead, she comes across as all knowing and made the use of local ingredients seem irrelevant. It\u2019s a bit insensitive coming from an adult.", "This is what 12 year olds are like. \n NTA, exactly, but it did need to be addressed. She was rude, but in a very normal for a 12 yo way. Speaking to her about it in front of others would have been the wrong move, so it was good to not do it right then.  \n\nBut also, the hostess was being a PITA.", "NAH. Yikes, I'm surprised at all the comments saying you should have told Nara off. If someone had swapped out a heap of ingredients for a thanks giving dinner I bet everyone would say it wasn't rude to point that out. Nara knew the dish and the host insisting that they knew what was right over someone who's cultural heritage is from that country smacks of privilege to me. If I cooked a traditional dish and someone who knew better than me told me it wasn't right I'd be asking how to make it correctly and asking where to get the ingredients.", "Like almost everyone told you, your daughter was extremly rude. You don't go into someone homes as a guest and critique their food infront of other guests. \n\n\nIt also sounds like your daughter didn't even taste it before saying something.\n\n\n\nGordon Ramsay once had one of his recipes cooked for him in a competition and the person changed it. He needed to be able to make it faster. Gordon tasted the food before saying anything. He actually liked it. \n\n\n\nEven IF your daughter ever had cooked the dish herself, this behaviour was just really bad \n\n\n\n\nalso, a dish even within a country can be prepared very differently. I live in germany and in my region kale is a popular winter dish. Every family has a different wqy of making it. It is commonly made with barley. My family in germany makes this german dish with rice. Your daughter would probably tell us how wrong we are lol.", "You could have said something to Nara, OP. It's very rude to be anything but a gracious guest when you are invited to someone's home. I'm sure Nara didn't intend to be rude but that's where you as an adult step in and provide guidance.", "I mean she broke an unspoken social contract. You should have spoken to her about how people may interpret her words but there's no need to reprimand her. She's 12, she's going to say stuff that others consider rude. You learn from it and move on. Idk why there is such a push to punish her or publicly shame her. Also, if you make something and substitute most of it, I'm sure most people would consider it another dish entirely.", "NTA - as someone who has a mixed heritage and had exposure to a variety of different cuisines growing up nothing grates me more than someone trying to serve up an authentic dish which is nothing like what it\u2019s supposed to be. \n\nThe substitution of ingredients is iffy\u2026.. there\u2019s certain ingredients which are synonymous with a dish and if you change them then it just isn\u2019t the same. You wouldn\u2019t serve a pizza with no cheese or a curry without rice, or a roast dinner without gravy. The type of pastry used for a samosa, patty, sausage roll or Cornish pasty is vital to the recipe. The herbs and spices you use make a huge impact - I can tell if they\u2019re not present. \n\nIf someone wants to be experimental with their cooking they should be open to feedback. \n\nAlso the claim of not being able to get the ingredients is a bit off to me - in my experience it\u2019s not difficult to get hold of unusual ingredients if you know where to shop. We have Jamaican, African, Chinese and polish shops in abundance here in shops and to order online. \n\nIf you want to cook an authentic dish then you should make the effort to do it properly, go and source the ingredients and find out the techniques - and until then you don\u2019t call it that, but just something you invented. \n\nVisiting a place on a holiday doesn\u2019t give you free reign to claim to be an expert", "NTA\n\n\n\"Here's a pumpkin spice latte, but instead of a cinnamon I\u2019m using licorice. And I cut the sugar in half. Too sweet you know? I am using water instead of milk. It\u2019s much simpler that way. But it's ok I've traveled throughout Starbucks in  America. I know how to create a pumpkin spice latte. You\u2019ll love it\"\n\nJust say the recipe is inspired by this thing you ate somewhere else, but you used ingredients that are more common here, so the flavour palette is obviously different.\n\nNara knows what she's talking about. You can't just take a dish, change out for the ingredients, and still call it the same thing.\n\nIt\u2019s such a colonial thing to do. So appropriative. So insufferable. \n\n(editing to say I\u2019m having a bad Internet day. Lol. And I left this comment as a reply to someone else. And then I thought that I deleted it when I was trying to edit it. And then I also thought, pumpkin spice latte was a better example for this group, then apple pie. So I wrote this here. And now I found the original. I\u2019m gonna put the Internet down now, and step away.)", "NTA- and i don't really understand all the comments going after Nara for correcting someone who was disgracing a traditional dish from one of her mother-countries. \n\nThere's a fine line between appreciation and Appropriation, and it sounds like the stepmother was really bridging that line....\n\nNara shouldn't be made to feel ashamed of correcting people on HER OWN cultures dishes, and I find that the stepmother was being fairly disrespectful in her way of \"educating\" the guests on something she clearly knew nothing about. That being said,  everyone was given an opportunity to learn authentic information about said dish/country.\n\nTeach our youth to be proud of their heritage- even \"simple\" things like cuisine play an important role in one's history/ culture.", "NTA.\nFirst off, I like her confidence. That woman was trying to say the dish was authentic but by the sounds of what you described it was inspired by and she called a spade a spade.\n\nSecond, what's with the adults telling you you should have put a 12 year old who is not your child in her place in front of people over that, ew. That could do more harm than good.If she was an adult saying that I would consider that rude because they should know better but she's a kid so impolite feels more apt for what you described.\n\nThird, if anything maybe a quick chat on the ride home like \"So, how you spoke to X was not ideal, she was trying to do something nice for everyone. What if you, Idk, baked a cake with some substituted ingredients and someone told you, in front of a bunch of people that you did it wrong and it shouldn't be called a cake? You were just trying to do something nice. Do you think that would bum you out a bit?...\" Or forward that type of conversation to her to her dad, if that's how things work.", "YTA. And so is Nara.", "NAH. It wasn\u2019t your place to discipline the child, and it was weird for the host to insist that her version was \u201cright\u201d when she has someone from that heritage present. \n\nThat being said, you definitely should have stepped in and said \u201cNora, I\u2019m sure it will still be good, even if it isn\u2019t what you\u2019re accustomed to!\u201d Especially when the host was getting flustered. Also, this is a good time to have a talk about tone and about where the line crosses between being informative and being rude.", "YTA - She was being incredibly rude. Imaging being a guest in someone home and telling them what to call what they cooked. The arrogance is off the charts. The team captain sounds like a bully.", "YTA\n\n> Nara said \u201c*if so many substitutes were used, they may as well call the dish a different name*\u201d\n\nThere is no way in hell anyone could possibly not interpret that as extremely rude - especially after the coach went out of his way to say was preparing \u201csomething special\u201d. The wife clearly went out of her way to prepare a unique and special dish for the team. And your daughter just shit all over it.\n\nThat said, the coach\u2019s call feels really weird and more of an issue between the coach and his wife than anything your daughter should be part of.", "YTA.  Nara was rude.  Cuisines have long been adapted to include what foods were available locally.   Perhaps the captain's stepmom was showing off a bit too much, but as the host, that should be humored.   Nara needs to learn that even when one is factually correct, there is an appropriate time, place, and manner to state things.  This was wrong on all three counts.", "Nara is rude. You could have asked her quietly to leave it alone so soft y t a.", "YTA. Being ' matter of fact' is just a nice way of saying know it all asshole. She absolutely did not have to say anything in public regarding the dish.", "YTA, and your daughter is a soft YTA due to her age. But you knew better and just stayed quiet.  Sorry, but your husband was right in correcting your bad manners. The host was trying to share a special dish that she enjoyed in her travels. It was bad manners to be pointing out the differences in front on everyone.  In my culture depending on what part of Mexico you were raised dishes changed by region. I would never be correcting anyone's attempt to recreate a dish they enjoyed from their travels in Mexico.  Honestly,  you two were just rude to the host.", "NTA\u2014- You\u2019re not mom, nor stepmom\u2026you are just Dad\u2019s Girlfriend. It\u2019s Dad\u2019s responsibility to have raised her with manners. You have only been the GF for a year you said. You are barely part of her life having moved recently to be living with them and clearly haven\u2019t had the opportunity to set up what is your role. \n\nYour boyfriend leaves you in charge of his daughter to go on a work trip and then criticizes you for not being what he wants you to be about an instance that would obviously involve a delicate situation involving the daughter defending her dead mother\u2019s cultural cuisine.\n\nThere is no handbook for raising stepchildren who had  a parent die. \n\nThere is no handbook for raising stepchildren from a different race/ethnicity/culture.\n\n\nYou are not an asshole for doing nothing.\n\n\nYou aren\u2019t stepmom and correcting your boyfriend\u2019s daughter in regards to something about her dead mom is a minefield. You would have been an asshole if you punished her without Dad\u2019s input. You would have been the asshole if you insulted her dead mom inadvertently even. You stayed quiet when it wasn\u2019t your place as  not a legal guardian and not a member of the race/culture being discussed.", "NTA. Some white lady was trying to get cultural points while completely disrespecting a culture. Your stepdaughter corrected her in a factual way. She wasn\u2019t gentle about it but it\u2019s not her responsibility to accommodate the feelings of adults who have misstepped. \nBefore anyone tries to start something, I\u2019m also a white lady. I hope if I ever pulled this shit, someone would call me out on it.", "Info: what was the dish supposed to be? \n\nI\u2019m kind of torn. It can be extremely rude of your stepdaughter or necessary given the liberties the lady took with the dish. For example, im Indian. If someone said they\u2019re serving me authentic butter chicken that neither contained the right spices, butter or chicken, I may say it was good but it wasn\u2019t exactly butter chicken. Just an example. It kind of depends on what it was supposed to be and what she did to it.", "ESH\n\nNara was rude for pointing out the host\u2019s shortcomings in public like that.\n\nThe wife host was making stuff up to make herself appear more knowledgeable than she is.\n\nYou should have Nara talk to the host after the party instead.", "NTA. Nara is 12 and sharing information about her heritage. Instead of being offended, everyone could have recognized that Nara is 12. The host could have engaged in the conversation with Nara, since she is clearly interested in the culture or she wouldn't have made such a big deal about making a version of the dish, but she chose to be offended instead.\n\nIf Nara was not 12, Nara likely would have had a less abrasive way to say it but would have been in the right to say it anyway.", "YTA. \"I'm right, though!\" and \"I'm just being honest!\" are usually the last refuge of people who know that they (or, in this case, their stepdaughter) are being rude and/or unkind.\n\nNara was a guest at the home of someone who went to the trouble to host her and her whole tennis team as well as cook this particular dish. Had Nara said something like, \"Oh, my mother was from this country,\" or, \"We have this at home, if you want to know where to get the actual ingredients, I can ask my dad,\" that would have been one thing. But turning it into some kind of weird competition with the hostess and basically shooting her down in front of everyone- to the extent that Nara's team captain (who *also* sounds like a piece of work, BTW)- noticed and called Nara to thank her for publicly humiliating her stepmom is... not okay.\n\nThere were a variety of ways to defuse this without either telling Nara to shut up or pretending that the dish with the substitutions was 100% authentic. Something like, \"Nara, it sounds like Mrs. Higgenbotham went to a lot of trouble to make this dish; if you know a good place to find the usual ingredients locally, maybe we could give her the name and address of the store.\" If she keeps being rude, then tell her that it's not polite to criticize the food when you're a guest at someone's house, and that the two of you can discuss this later. Boom, done.\n\nI would also be very curious to know how old Nara was when her mother passed, how much contact she has with her mother's side of the family now, and whether her father regularly makes dishes from her mother's culture (or just this dish in particular).", "Also, sometimes it\u2019s really hard to get the local ingredients. I can\u2019t get lime leaves without driving to an Asian food store, and the closest one is 40 minutes away. I haven\u2019t yet found anywhere that I can buy lamb in my area, and other specialty meats like rabbit and Cornish hens are very hit and miss. So if someone is doing the best they can with the ingredients they can actually get, they don\u2019t need criticism.", "[Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.](https://Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh.No)  No, Nara should not be reprimanded. Yes, everyone makes dishes from other countries in which ingredients are substituted because of availability / cost / personal preference. So, while 'General Tso's chicken' is not an actual Chinese dish, it potentially is a dish that a Chinese chef created to cater to Western palettes but based on Chinese cuisine. Just an example. Chicken tikka, pizza, naan/tortilla/flatbread, etc.\n\nNara wasn't wrong, the host was grandstanding, who cares. \n\nConversation - not revolving around this dinner - can be had where you and your family explore cuisines, how they have evolved, been changed and evolved based on the (assumed) country of origin through the routes they took (silk road, colonialism, etc.). Then you could explore the influence of cuisines (French/African/Southern/California/different regions in India could take years). \n\nBottom line, no one here was \\*wrong\\* other than anyone suggesting your daughter be punished for her statements.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA, and so is Nara, though I\u2019m sympathetic to the fact that the opinions of the dish centered around her late mom, which could easily have led to the blatant disrespect. But honesty should always be coupled with diplomacy, otherwise it\u2019s just vitriol. And I understand as a really new stepmom or even just an adult person in a teen\u2019s life, it can be hard to know when to step in. But if the parent is gone and has left you in charge, then it is definitely on you to take charge in situations like this. Oh well! Have her apologize and move on. It\u2019s not the end of the world.", "YTA and so was Nara.", "Nta. She wasnt criticizing the overall taste of the food or whether it tasted good or bad. She was correcting the *information* the host was sharing to the group. The host was rude to claim knowledge of something she clearly knew very little about. If the host had said \u201cthis is my spin on it\u201d then sure, itd be different. But, she put info out there as fact and was wrong. Then, doubled down instead of listening to someone with real, lived experience, wrongfully assuming her travels 20 years ago gave her some sort of claim. Im glad that Nara felt confident enough to be able to speak up about her heritage and correct people who dont have all the info.\n\nI think WHAT she criticized here is the deciding factor. She didn\u2019t criticize the taste of the food. She corrected the name of it. \n\nIf you\u2019re serving a dish from another country or culture, thats great, but its a real asshole move to think you know how best to make it or how it should taste over someone else with actual connections (especially if you know you arent using the right ingredients, intentionally). If i were in the hosts position, i would be HAPPY Nara shared that info with me bc if the hosts goal is to make this dish, she should welcome input from someone who knows it so well so she can make it as good as possible. Id love that kind of input, tbh.", "i understand why she spoke up and i\u2019m sure she did it with the typical 12-year-old bluntness. but i don\u2019t think she did it at the right time. it seems like bad taste to critique a host\u2019s food in front of all the guests. so slight YTA - i think you could have intervened so that nara could have relayed her concerns about the authenticity of the dish to the wife host in a more private setting. that would have been a little politer.", "NTA your step daughter was just educating this (presumably white) woman who thinks she knows more about a culture because she \u201ctravelled in her youth\u201d than someone FROM that actual culture. Nara should not have to make herself small to accommodate the feelings of an adult. A key tenant in white supremacy is the entitlement to comfort and if someone expresses they are wrong their comfort is valued as more important than the actual thing at hand. She should have thanked your daughter for sharing about her culture.", "YTA\n\nIn what universe is that not rude? Come on.", "Honestly NAH Nara is only 12, she seemed exited to share about her culture and probably didn\u2019t think she was being rude or disrespectful.\nI saw no need to reprimand her for it.", "NTA", "YTA", "Like Walter Sobchak - she's not wrong. She's just an asshole.\nBut she's 12. \n\nYTA for not showing her a better way of handling it.", "Nta you're stepdaughter basically called out cultural appropriation. She has a right to educate people on her culture and correct them when they miss use it.", "Nara needs to learn that while it's ok to discuss her different experiences with that dish, the way she spoke was rude, arrogant, and dismissive of the host's efforts. You should have intervened and smoothed things over. Nara's AH behavior can be understood in the context if her age, you don't have that excuse to lean on.\n\nESH except the dad (and probably the host. Who knows, maybe she was especially pretentious and was also AH. Not that that excuses Nara's behavior)", "NTA she wasn't rude. The hose was white washing a dish from Nara;s mother's home country. Thats a MAJOR PROBLEM they have. Erasure of a culture is dangerous and she was right to speak up for hers Your husband needs to get over it. He's the white parent, he really wouldnt get it, would he?", "YTA", "YTA - That was definitely a rude thing for Nara to do. Someone generously welcomed her into their home and took the time to prepare a meal for her, and she repaid them with skepticism and criticism of their efforts before even tasting one bite.\n\n>She said if so many substitutes were used, they may as well call the dish a different name. \n\nThat sort of phrasing is not polite, unless it is used in a specific joking situation. That does not seem to be the case here. \n\nNara was rude, but the responsibility for her rude behavior continuing unchecked in that situation lands on you as the parental figure. You need to be teaching her the appropriate way to point out such differences *and* how to decide when it is better to just let such differences go. There was not really a need to say any of what she said. \n\nHowever, if she just really wanted to comment on the differences to help people better understand her cultural heritage, she could have simply said something like, \u201cOh, my mom used to make this for me, because she also came from *country name*. She would usually use ______, ______, and ______ like they do in *country name*, though.

I have seen so many delicious cultural dishes butchered, watered down, and ruined by people who just (plain and simple) don't know how to cook it.

Being so pushy about it was wrong, she could have said the actual ingredients supposed to be used just once and left it at that or waited to say something to someone after the get together in private.

We currently moved to a new city because of my boyfriend\u2019s job promotion (I freelance) and are in the middle of settling down. Nara and I get along very well.\n\nNara plays tennis. Since the move, she\u2019s been in the school team and competed a bit. The parents of her teammates often organize some kind of get together and her father and I tried our best to have her attend most of them. I would say Nara got along well with all her teammates and I thought the parents were friendly. Last week the team captain\u2019s parents hosted a potluck party at their place.\n\nNara and I brought over some brownies. There really was a lot of all kinds of food. The team captain\u2019s father did most of the greeting telling us his wife was preparing something special for us all. Once everyone was at the party, the wife came out of the kitchen with a special dish, a recipe of a specific country.\n\nNow, Nara looks white but her late mother actually came from that very country. The wife host began to serve everyone and share her recipe and ingredients and how it was \u201cnot that difficult to make once you substitute the local ingredients\u201d and feel free to ask her for tips.\n\nAt this point Nara spoke up, saying that the authentic recipes included such and such and how their particular scent and taste added to the whole experience of eating the dish. She said if so many substitutes were used, they may as well call the dish a different name. The wife host looked a little unsettled and told Nara that she and her husband traveled a lot in their youth and she had the dish many times and knew what it was supposed to taste like and the substituted ingredients work just fine. Nara then said her mom was from the dish\u2019s country of origin and she understood that some ingredients were hard to come by but substituting so much turned the dish into something else altogether.\n\nDuring all this I mostly kept silent. Nara was not being rude, just matter of fact, and as this was a matter of her heritage I thought she could speak up. The host wife spluttered a bit before saying everyone should just go ahead and enjoy her dish, no matter the name. Everyone tried though nobody asked for seconds (I personally thought it was a little bland) and there was a lot of leftovers.\n\nNara\u2019s team captain later called her, thanking her for putting her \u201cannoying stepmom in her place.\u201d When my boyfriend came back from his business trip and learned of this, however, he thought I should have reprimanded Nara for being rude to the host. He also had a talk with Nara and she seemed to be sulking a bit though she was not grounded or anything. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

However, just a single mild attempt, not a major public reprimand or argument.  \n\nI think afterwards, at your home, a discussion about polite guest behavior about foods offered, as well as mentioning how many quite different recipes of food dishes are all seen as authentic would have been good. Examples are varieties of recipes for chili or meat loaf, with each person thinking theirs is best or most authentic. If done with listening to the child, and encouraging her to talk about her mom's cooking, it could possibly have educated her.\n\nGuests who criticize the food do not often get return invitations.", "YTA.

And I mean with so much black pepper that it gives the name to the recipe since \"pepe\" is black pepper in italian and \"peposo\" basically mean \"blackpeppery\".\n\nYou can use a different red wine if you don't find Chianti, provided that you use a wine with similar charateristics.

On the east coast of Africa for example Arabic and Indian dishes are offered that have their own local version with some different spices, different meat and different veggies than the original version and yet they have the same name. This is the exact opposite of your colonial argument since Arabs were the colonizers and Indians came because of (slave) trade and influenced the region.\n\nIn many countries immigrants open restaurants offering their native food but change somethings to match the local taste better and substitute ingredients when stuff is hard to get and they don't call their dishes blabla inspired foo but the name the original dish is based on.

Dishes rarely have only one correct way to be made even in their country of origin but people always claim their mother's or grandmother's version as the one true way (especially children of people who emigrated to another country, it makes sense and I get why).\n\nBut only the most pedantic people give a shit about any of this and I think it's even more crazy to give a shit about someone  who cooks a foreign dish in a private setting and doesn't feel like making up a new name for the dish because they had to substitute some of the ingredients because of availability problems.

Then when I talk about my partners & that I live on a reservation people are like \"whoaaaa no way\"", "Give your (step)kid a chocolate covered apple. \nCACKLE as they bite into that onion that masquerade as an apple", "Inject an apple with some green colored sugar liquid from the 80s and then offer it to her.", "Oh yeah, I think the best part of having a step mum is calling her evil lol. Especially when they (like mine is) are a sweetheart.", "I know you were joking, but my step mother in law is lovely.", "Here\u2019s what you say when you are a guest in someone\u2019s home who is making food for you \u201cthank you, it looks delicious.\u201d Nobody asked for a freaking lesson on cuisine. Especially from a 12 year old brat.", "I\u2019m Quebecer and if someone presents me with \u201cpoutine\u201d made with shredded mozzarella and the wrong kind of gravy, I won\u2019t pretend it\u2019s poutine (at a conference\u2019s buffet in the US we were once offered tater tots, shredded cheese and congealed gravy; I\u2019m sorry my dude but that ain\u2019t poutine!). I\u2019m also not going to pretend my version of harira soup is anything close to the real thing. Or my dumplings", "For me, it\u2019s how high and mighty the hostess acted. \u201cThe recipe was super easy when you change most of the ingredients, feel free to ask me for tips.\u201d \u201cMy husband and I have traveled so we know how this food is made.\u201d I don\u2019t blame Nara for wanting to speak up.", "It sounded more like someone calling a dish poutine but they used Velveeta instead of cheese\\*, substituted breaded parnsips for the potatoes and topped it with white gravy.  There comes a point where a dish just isn't what it claims to be.  \n\n\n\\*I don't care what the marketing department says, Velveeta is melty radioactive plastic.", "Considering what Nara is saying about the taste and smell being a big part of the dish and that OP said it tasted a bit bland, I\u2019m pretty sure the whole thing was essentially not as well spiced. Especially since the host was claiming that the substituted ingredients worked just fine. \n\nWe only have OP\u2019s take on how Nana did with the whole thing but I\u2019d say NTA for both.", "I\u2019m queer and disabled, myself! Married my childhood BFF (great decision). I became physically disabled after law school (but was already a disability rights attorney!) in a catastrophic, I-should-be-dead car wreck. So now I have physical AND mental disabilities (autism, ADHD). I\u2019m glad to serve our shared communities and beyond.\n\nLove the coming out twice bit! An utter delight. :D", "Caramel works better. Lulls kids into a false sense of security. Chocolate covered apples are \u201csus\u201d according to the neighbor child, who is 11. \n\nI\u2019m an evil dog mom, myself. Evil because I trained my dogs and they have manners, which are enforced. Especially the non begging for human food one.", "My maternal surname is Prussian and when grampa immigrated here he (or his immigration officer?) chopped it down to \"Roman\" so now everyone thinks it's Hispanic which has been all kinds of fun since my step-dad's surname is Czech and on getting to the US they changed a G to a J in the middle (which changed the pronunciation completely) and either way no one pronounces it correctly. Annnnnd I'm also half Ojibwe but the reservation school that stole my grandmother gave *her* a white surname \"Smith\".\n\n\nI'm kinda screwed all around for names and cultural recognition.", "This would be a pretty much perfect way to approach this. Respect for Nara, her heritage/her attachment to her mother and dealing with it at the time when it has the most significance and context to be retained , not later when they are only going to become a pair of loosely associated memories.", "Omg yes...and then when you take those dishes and north Americans \"recreate\" them or the fastfood industry makes a version. Heck just look at the history of \"chinese\" chop suey. Food evolves geographically due to product availability and individual interpretations!"]}
