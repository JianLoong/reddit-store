As his partner and someone who loves him very much, naturally I was worried too but I didn't talk about so as not to add to his anxiety.\n\nAnyway, we got to the hospital in plenty of time. We're waiting at the theatre submission room where we were told go, the nurse comes out and says my partners name the next thing I know he's stood up. She said something to me about going to the end of the corridor, just to note I am hard of hearing and use hearing aids. I started to panic a bit because they were taking him away and I didn't understand what the nurse was saying as she had a strong accent and I could not hear her well. So I asked where am I supposed to go? She said I can wait at then end of the corridor or go home and someone will call me when he's done. I said but you don't have my number? At that point my partner told me off I can't remember exactly what he said but he thinks I was rude to the nurse. I can be blunt but I had absolutely no intention of being rude, I have to upmost respect for anyone who works in the hospital. he said I was acting like they're idiots and they don't know what they're doing. In hindsight, of course he can give them my number, I was just panicking and the whole interaction lasted no more than a minute, and then he was gone, he gave me stern peck and walk off clearly annoyed. He then whatsapped me saying 'U were very rude!', that's the last interaction we had until 3 hours later when the wheeled him back at to the ward at which point he shouted 'who let you in here?' and said to the nurses I'm a tyrant and then asked me why I came back. That bit I'm fine with because he'd just had anaesthetic and I know it makes people weird.\n\nAITA for being upset about feeling misunderstood, I don't know why I'm struggling to let this go.

And to be willing to wait for him during his operation. And for asking for clarification from the medical professional about where to wait-because hospitals aren\u2019t *at all* confusing and labyrinth like. And you weren\u2019t nervous for him, both of you being in an unfamiliar situation. \n\nOh, yes. You were so *rude* to the medical\nprofessional. But now all\nis well because your partner has forgiven you! So kind of him. So empathetic. So understanding. \n\nI roll my fucking eyes. NTA", "NTA - it's a major red flag you can't talk to your partner about your feelings (and that he listens), and you have to come to Reddit. \n\nEven if what you said came out rude (which isn't certain) it doesn't feel right that it has blown that much.\n\nYour partner should act as a partner not like if you're an embarrassment to him.", "There is absolutely no reason for you to require your husband's forgiveness. He sounds like he's being overly harsh but that may have been the stress talking?? \nIf you never have to see the nurse again, she probably won't remember you. It's just another person who had some issue with her that day (I say this from my experience in hospitality and teaching). \nYour husband's behaviour afterwards- I personally find that concerning.\n\nQuestions: do you normally hyperfixate on certain issues or interactions that you have? Has he reacted like this before to a concern you have? What do you mean he said you make him sick?", "NTA\n\nYour partner, though. Seems like a shitty dude.\n\nStop over thinking it,  you did nothing wrong.", "Ok here\u2019s the thing. You need to stop fixating on this one interaction with the nurse. It was less than two minutes long and emotions were high, you had difficulty understanding her, sometimes people just have awkward interactions and that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ve already spent way too much time over analyzing a simple interaction that isn\u2019t important enough. Put it out of your mind entirely. \n\nThe bigger problem is that your boyfriend is a jerk. He speaks to you disrespectfully all the time. He is more focused on letting you know he thinks you messed up than anything else. He doesn\u2019t ever validate your feelings and he calls you names. He says you *make him sick*. Those are horrible things to say to a person you supposedly love. You deserve a lot better. NTA.", "This guy sounds like a gaslighter. If you are feeling like your interactions with him are making you wonder if you're delusional or crazy, that is a huge red flag. NTA.", "Your partner is emotionally abusive. He forgives *you*?", "NTA. Your bf enjoys bullying you to make himself feel better. Since he has so conveniently claimed that you make him sick, I'd say a permanent quarantine from him is in order.", "NTA but your partner is incredibly rude and does not treat you well at all.", "Why were you immediately panicking?", "NTA - I would dump this man it sounds like he regularly verbally abuses you", "You are overlooking some major red flags in your partners behavior. He called you a tyrant and after the anesthesia wore off said you make him feel sick. Even if my hubby thought I was rude he wouldn\u2019t humiliate me in front of someone, he would have a calm discussion about and try to hear my side of it. Everything about this relationship sounds unhealthy.", "NTA but your partner is an AH for the verbal abuse. You deserve better", "There is absolutely more to this story than you have written here.  I would love to hear this story from your partner and the nurse.\n\nBut yes, you need to let it go.", "As a nurse, I can say I personally would not find you rude in the slightest!", "This situation doesn't really make sense. First, does your partner not know you have hearing difficulties? It just seems very strange for him to respond that way to you not hearing something. \n\nSecond, how does your partner WhatsApp you after he's taken back for surgery? I doubt there's a decent hospital in the world that lets a random person take their phone into the surgical area.", "INFO Unless you said something about the nurse's accent that came across as racist, I have a hard time understanding your partner's anger. What did you say to her??", "You\u2019re forgiven? For what exactly? It doesn\u2019t sound like you were rude. And he \u201ctold you off\u201d and yelled at you, so even if you were short, he was more so.\n\nDoes he always treat you like you are less than? And that he\u2019s embarrassed by you?\n\nNTA, but figure out if this type of treatment is something you want in your life. I wouldn\u2019t.", "INFO: OP, an honest question.\n\nIs there any reason your husband would be worried that you'd insult the nurse? Do you have a history of arguing with service providers such as nurses, restaurant workers, or other service workers?", "NTA\nMisunderstandings happen often. You apologised and it should be resolved. But your partners continued bad reaction and you mentioning other situations (I am assuming with him) where your feelings aren't validated suggests that this isn't a great relationship for you and you should really think about what exactly you are getting from this.", "So, you were stressed, didn\u2019t understand.  Did you say you didn\u2019t understand?  Did you clarify what expectations were? \n\nYour partner was also stressed and the one having surgery.  Also, the medications used for pain and anesthesia can cause delirium and behavior changes.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH.  You for continuing to be butt hurt and repeatedly bringing it up.  Stop making this about you. Your partner sucks because he is being unkind.  I cannot say anything about the nurse involved.  Was she being mean to you or were you interpreting it that way because you were stressed, failed to clarify what was happening and did not ask questions?", "NTA. I nearly voted NAH because your partner was probably really stressed and a lot of time whether or not someone is considered rude in these sort of situations it comes down to tone/vibes and is pretty subjective. However the fact that he has a pattern of dismissing and invalidating you makes him TA, and him shouting you down for wanting to talk things over makes it worse. You did nothing wrong and it's fucked up that he's treating you like this.", "Yta you were doing the minimum for your partner and where rude to a nurse and are now annoyed then he supported the people providing him with care and treatment", "I think it\u2019s very easy in a moment like this for things to be misunderstood or misinterpreted.\n\nMy wife was once sick and had to be taken to hospital in an ambulance. The paramedic took me aside and told me I looked too worried, it wasn\u2019t good for my wife, I had to look like I was chill to stop her worrying. So I followed his advice.\n\nAbout two years later I was chatting to her and mentioned this. She gave out a huge sigh and got emotional. Turned out she had spent two years thinking I didn\u2019t really care about her because I didn\u2019t show enough concern in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. That paramedic nearly ended my marriage!\n\nRoundabout way to say that just as my stressed wife misunderstood and misinterpreted my actions, he could easily have misunderstood yours. Stressed, tense, worried\u2026he probably misunderstood and I don\u2019t think it means that your behaviour was inappropriate.\n\nYou need to move on though. Continuing to bring it up with him, where do you think it will get you? He has his perspective and he has forgiven you. Stop worrying about it. What you are doing now appears to be trying to convince him that you are right and his opinion is invalid. You don\u2019t need him to be convinced, you don\u2019t need him to be wrong, you just need a healthy relationship. Accept his forgiveness from him, accept that you did nothing wrong for you, and move on with your life.", "I just finished reading Girl on a Train last night.  It's a good thriller, but it is an AMAZING view of an abusive, gaslighting relationship from inside the head of the victim.\n\nSo, my perspective is probably skewed from that recent experience, and you are not a fictional character. But you are NTA for wanting to address the discrepancy between your lived experience and your partner's version of events.  \n\nYou can both work on things of course; there are no couples with perfect partners.  If you know you are \"blunt\" you should work on the common courtesy of, well, courtesy.  And if he knows you are hard of hearing, he should support you in your interactions in a world where you naturally get fewer clues than the people around you.\n\nThis could be a discrepancy, which is why it is bothering you.  But if this behavior is part of a pattern, then this is not a healthy relationship.", "Omg.  Let it go. Apologize.

My problem with this incident is you\u2019re wearing hearing aides, my sons (2), my husband have varying degrees of hearing loss all wear hearing aides -  hearing aides do NOT \u2018fix\u2019 hearing (glasses can correct vision, hearing aides amplify sound, but do NOT give sound you don\u2019t have for speech that\u2019s a whole lot of sounds that aren\u2019t there! Ever!)\n\nI hope you are working with deaf, that you have found others that are your peers and can relate to your challenges, HOH individuals often walk a tight rope not fitting in to either a deaf world or a hearing world.\n\nMy eldest learned ASL, the others try, but definitely live in a hearing world but All have partners that know and help communicate with the hearing world, it\u2019s especially challenging when there are masks!  Continue to try and communicate with the hearing world. NEVER ever be embarrassed that you\u2019re hearing is different!

If I had written the comment that you did, I am positive you would have told me I'm with someone who is gaslighting, traumatizing, demoralizing, invalidating, insulting, and inappropriate to me. So please allow me to do the same for you.

Full stop. His behavior as indicated in the post already made me suspect he was abusive, but the fact that he tells you that you *make him want to kill himself* is manipulative.\n\nDo you have any family you can stay with? Friends? I know he just had surgery and you feel as if you need to take care of him, but Jesus Christ. Someone else can take care of him, it shouldn\u2019t be on you to care for someone who treats you like that.", "My condolences for your friend. Life us not giving you a good time at the moment. I don't know where you live, but do have something like LifeLine where you can talk to counsellors on the phone? It seems like maybe your partner needs a break from your revisting of situations. And you need to talk to someone to just off load all the intense feelings you must be feeling right now. \n\nAlso, well done for being able to get out of bed and be functioning. With all that going on I'd be super overwhelmed (inattentive type ADHD here). I would completely freeze/shut down with that pressure. \n\nI'd say he does not care about the hospital incident anymore and doesn't want to hear about it. This can either be good or bad. Good that it is done and dusted it's a none issue. Bad because he is invalidating your feelings about the event because you were not treated well and he kinda made you at to be a 'bad' person. I never realised just how vulnerable people feel with hearing loss until my mum finally got hearing aids (after 5 years of the doctor saying she just needed her ears to be washed out by the nurse). \n\nHopefully that ramble gives you some ideas or a chance to feel heard. Feel better soon!", "  Why would he say it if he doesn\u2019t need it? If this is a pattern you definitely need to rethink the relationship.\n\nI am hard of hearing too, but I don\u2019t wear hearing aids it can be very frustrating.

It is on him to learn those things for himself. Therapy is a good start, but you do not have to put up with someone who hurts you (emotionally and mentally) while they are trying to figure themselves out.

I was trying to determine if 1. your husband snapped at you because of his anxiety, and is now too proud to admit that he was wrong, or 2. this fit into a pattern of behavior and he was tired of dealing with your shit, if you'll forgive the expression.\n\nNTA.

I think I'm probably to soft as we've been through alot and him especially has had an unbelievable amount of trauma.

I'm usually a strong person and don't always mind that I have to support him and myself emotionally mostly but I've had a rough so I'm vulnerable too atm. Uhhh life eh!", "Thank you! Yeah life is tough atm and for the most part I keep my head held high, so maybe I'm latching on to this tiny thing because of everything else that's going on.\n\nI am in therapy at the moment so I will definitely bring this up with her. Being hard of hearing is exhausting and I think that's part of it, my partner just doesn't get it and sometimes doesn't believe me when I say I can't hear things. I guess it comes down to people not ever being able to understand something they don't actually experience themselves which is fair enough. I'm sorry to hear your mum had such a hard time with her hearing, I hope the hearing aids have helped - they certainly make it bearable for me.", "This.  Take a step back and imagine this guy was treating your sister or mom this way. How would you feel?", "Thank you :) this makes me sad because I know you are right in a way.

I got a stchicker!\" because of the numb, still bleeding mouth.\n\nOn a related note, if you have medical trauma or dental anxiety, go for sedation.

Go to a movie by yourself why are you making him comfortable when he disrespects you?", "I understand. It's a slippery slope.\n\nYou are a strong person. Being aware of your own vulnerability is part of that strength. I can understand not wanting to abandon someone you care for during their vulnerability. But don't lose sight of the fact that being a strong person often sets up this perspective of \"I'm strong enough to handle it but they aren't\" that never changes. Being strong is supposed to be a helpful part of your life, not a punishing life sentence that puts you in situations where your strength can't feel strong. You can find someone you don't mind supporting who is also doing the same for you without hurting you. \n\nMy partner used to freak out when hospitals were involved. After a date where I fell, he took me to the ED and kept saying that because I hit my head and they weren't treating me fast enough, clearly I was going to die (previous trauma). Once I got him to listen to me (\"I'm not going to die, here's the triage information that shows why,\" I'm always chill in emergencies), he immediately realized it wasn't about him at the moment, snapped out of it, and switched over to being completely about how he can support me and make sure I don't fall between the cracks. When I was cleared to go home, we walked out into the parking lot and he broke and started crying from how scared he had been. In that situation we had both been strong for each other and were able to be vulnerable too. \n\nWhatever happens, please be gentle with yourself. Compassionate people often lose sight of the fact that they are being amazingly compassionate and supportive to everyone but themselves. If it was anyone else, you wouldn't let them slip between the cracks. So don't judge yourself but also don't settle. Your partner may not be able to support you with the same strength and compassion, but they have to be able to see, understand, and appreciate it in you.\n\nTake care.", "I assure you- it is never too late to love yourself.
