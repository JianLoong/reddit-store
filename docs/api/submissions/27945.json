We're waiting at the theatre submission room where we were told go, the nurse comes out and says my partners name the next thing I know he's stood up. She said something to me about going to the end of the corridor, just to note I am hard of hearing and use hearing aids. I started to panic a bit because they were taking him away and I didn't understand what the nurse was saying as she had a strong accent and I could not hear her well. So I asked where am I supposed to go? She said I can wait at then end of the corridor or go home and someone will call me when he's done. I said but you don't have my number? At that point my partner told me off I can't remember exactly what he said but he thinks I was rude to the nurse. I can be blunt but I had absolutely no intention of being rude, I have to upmost respect for anyone who works in the hospital. he said I was acting like they're idiots and they don't know what they're doing. In hindsight, of course he can give them my number, I was just panicking and the whole interaction lasted no more than a minute, and then he was gone, he gave me stern peck and walk off clearly annoyed.

That bit I'm fine with because he'd just had anaesthetic and I know it makes people weird.\n\nAITA for being upset about feeling misunderstood, I don't know why I'm struggling to let this go.

And to be willing to wait for him during his operation. And for asking for clarification from the medical professional about where to wait-because hospitals aren\u2019t *at all* confusing and labyrinth like. And you weren\u2019t nervous for him, both of you being in an unfamiliar situation. \n\nOh, yes. You were so *rude* to the medical\nprofessional. But now all\nis well because your partner has forgiven you! So kind of him. So empathetic. So understanding. \n\nI roll my fucking eyes. NTA", "NTA - it's a major red flag you can't talk to your partner about your feelings (and that he listens), and you have to come to Reddit. \n\nEven if what you said came out rude (which isn't certain) it doesn't feel right that it has blown that much.\n\nYour partner should act as a partner not like if you're an embarrassment to him.", "There is absolutely no reason for you to require your husband's forgiveness. He sounds like he's being overly harsh but that may have been the stress talking?? \nIf you never have to see the nurse again, she probably won't remember you. It's just another person who had some issue with her that day (I say this from my experience in hospitality and teaching). \nYour husband's behaviour afterwards- I personally find that concerning.\n\nQuestions: do you normally hyperfixate on certain issues or interactions that you have? Has he reacted like this before to a concern you have? What do you mean he said you make him sick?", "NTA\n\nYour partner, though. Seems like a shitty dude.\n\nStop over thinking it,  you did nothing wrong.", "Ok here\u2019s the thing. You need to stop fixating on this one interaction with the nurse. It was less than two minutes long and emotions were high, you had difficulty understanding her, sometimes people just have awkward interactions and that\u2019s fine. You\u2019ve already spent way too much time over analyzing a simple interaction that isn\u2019t important enough. Put it out of your mind entirely. \n\nThe bigger problem is that your boyfriend is a jerk. He speaks to you disrespectfully all the time. He is more focused on letting you know he thinks you messed up than anything else. He doesn\u2019t ever validate your feelings and he calls you names. He says you *make him sick*. Those are horrible things to say to a person you supposedly love. You deserve a lot better. NTA.", "This guy sounds like a gaslighter. If you are feeling like your interactions with him are making you wonder if you're delusional or crazy, that is a huge red flag. NTA.", "Your partner is emotionally abusive. He forgives *you*?", "NTA. Your bf enjoys bullying you to make himself feel better. Since he has so conveniently claimed that you make him sick, I'd say a permanent quarantine from him is in order.", "NTA but your partner is incredibly rude and does not treat you well at all.", "Why were you immediately panicking?", "NTA - I would dump this man it sounds like he regularly verbally abuses you", "You are overlooking some major red flags in your partners behavior. He called you a tyrant and after the anesthesia wore off said you make him feel sick. Even if my hubby thought I was rude he wouldn\u2019t humiliate me in front of someone, he would have a calm discussion about and try to hear my side of it. Everything about this relationship sounds unhealthy.", "NTA but your partner is an AH for the verbal abuse. You deserve better", "There is absolutely more to this story than you have written here.  I would love to hear this story from your partner and the nurse.\n\nBut yes, you need to let it go.", "As a nurse, I can say I personally would not find you rude in the slightest!", "This situation doesn't really make sense. First, does your partner not know you have hearing difficulties? It just seems very strange for him to respond that way to you not hearing something. \n\nSecond, how does your partner WhatsApp you after he's taken back for surgery? I doubt there's a decent hospital in the world that lets a random person take their phone into the surgical area.", "INFO Unless you said something about the nurse's accent that came across as racist, I have a hard time understanding your partner's anger. What did you say to her??", "You\u2019re forgiven? For what exactly? It doesn\u2019t sound like you were rude. And he \u201ctold you off\u201d and yelled at you, so even if you were short, he was more so.\n\nDoes he always treat you like you are less than? And that he\u2019s embarrassed by you?\n\nNTA, but figure out if this type of treatment is something you want in your life. I wouldn\u2019t.", "INFO: OP, an honest question.\n\nIs there any reason your husband would be worried that you'd insult the nurse? Do you have a history of arguing with service providers such as nurses, restaurant workers, or other service workers?", "NTA\nMisunderstandings happen often. You apologised and it should be resolved. But your partners continued bad reaction and you mentioning other situations (I am assuming with him) where your feelings aren't validated suggests that this isn't a great relationship for you and you should really think about what exactly you are getting from this.", "So, you were stressed, didn\u2019t understand.  Did you say you didn\u2019t understand?  Did you clarify what expectations were? \n\nYour partner was also stressed and the one having surgery.  Also, the medications used for pain and anesthesia can cause delirium and behavior changes.\n\nI\u2019m going to say ESH.  You for continuing to be butt hurt and repeatedly bringing it up.  Stop making this about you. Your partner sucks because he is being unkind.  I cannot say anything about the nurse involved.  Was she being mean to you or were you interpreting it that way because you were stressed, failed to clarify what was happening and did not ask questions?", "NTA. I nearly voted NAH because your partner was probably really stressed and a lot of time whether or not someone is considered rude in these sort of situations it comes down to tone/vibes and is pretty subjective. However the fact that he has a pattern of dismissing and invalidating you makes him TA, and him shouting you down for wanting to talk things over makes it worse. You did nothing wrong and it's fucked up that he's treating you like this.", "Yta you were doing the minimum for your partner and where rude to a nurse and are now annoyed then he supported the people providing him with care and treatment", "I think it\u2019s very easy in a moment like this for things to be misunderstood or misinterpreted.\n\nMy wife was once sick and had to be taken to hospital in an ambulance. The paramedic took me aside and told me I looked too worried, it wasn\u2019t good for my wife, I had to look like I was chill to stop her worrying. So I followed his advice.\n\nAbout two years later I was chatting to her and mentioned this. She gave out a huge sigh and got emotional. Turned out she had spent two years thinking I didn\u2019t really care about her because I didn\u2019t show enough concern in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. That paramedic nearly ended my marriage!\n\nRoundabout way to say that just as my stressed wife misunderstood and misinterpreted my actions, he could easily have misunderstood yours. Stressed, tense, worried\u2026he probably misunderstood and I don\u2019t think it means that your behaviour was inappropriate.\n\nYou need to move on though. Continuing to bring it up with him, where do you think it will get you? He has his perspective and he has forgiven you. Stop worrying about it. What you are doing now appears to be trying to convince him that you are right and his opinion is invalid. You don\u2019t need him to be convinced, you don\u2019t need him to be wrong, you just need a healthy relationship. Accept his forgiveness from him, accept that you did nothing wrong for you, and move on with your life.", "I just finished reading Girl on a Train last night.  It's a good thriller, but it is an AMAZING view of an abusive, gaslighting relationship from inside the head of the victim.\n\nSo, my perspective is probably skewed from that recent experience, and you are not a fictional character. But you are NTA for wanting to address the discrepancy between your lived experience and your partner's version of events.  \n\nYou can both work on things of course; there are no couples with perfect partners.  If you know you are \"blunt\" you should work on the common courtesy of, well, courtesy.  And if he knows you are hard of hearing, he should support you in your interactions in a world where you naturally get fewer clues than the people around you.\n\nThis could be a discrepancy, which is why it is bothering you.  But if this behavior is part of a pattern, then this is not a healthy relationship.", "Omg.  Let it go. Apologize.

Accents make it even more impossible as well as when people who do not enunciate. \n\nI've gotten to the point that once I've told someone that I have met my half of the deal and if another person can not meet me halfway, then we are no longer communicating. I can't help my hearing loss, and I also do recognize some people have a hard time speaking up, but eventually, it is no longer my problem. Sometimes people forget because I listen so well, which is understanble, but they do not get to be an asshole to me if I fail to hear them.

This happened in front of me, and she looked at me after because I\u2019m her daughter- I\u2019ve always helped her understand the world. I enunciated, rephrased what he said so she had different words and context clues, and made sure she could see my mouth.

Apparently that is the only thing I adamantly declare, but I make sure they all know it, adamantly, with my finger pointing straight up in the air as I inform them of my very important disclaimer. Because it's important, adamantly so.", "I had a conversation after waking up after a D&C that made me feel like I was losing my mind.  I was an outpatient, so I went to the nurse and asked if I could go.  She said, \"When you wake up.\"  I said, \"I'm awake.  So, I can go?\"  And she said, \"You can go home when you wake up.\"  I said, \"So...  I can go home then?\"  And she said, \"You can go home when you wake up.\"  I went back to my bed and sat there for a bit, trying to figure out what the hell was going on, then I figured, \"I'll just... go back to sleep I guess?\" and I lay down and tried to go back to sleep.  After an hour or so I went and asked if I could go now and the answer was yes.

You are worth much more than being emotionally abused or manipulated which is what he is doing. \n\nHe is using his past trauma to manipulate you.

He\u2019s gaslighting you into thinking you deserve it. I was in a relationship like this, so it resonates.

The waitress brought me the wrong drink. After I told her she WAS HORRIBLE AND RUDE the rest of the meal to only me.

You weren\u2019t being rude he was and instead of him admitting that he was nervous and took it out on you, he is trying to minimize your concerns to protect his ego. Your feelings are not being validated at all, he is using your sensitivity and insecurities against yourself to avoid his blame. I wouldn\u2019t expect any insights about yourself from him at all, in fact I would expect him to use them against you to lie about some other thing in the future. He could blame your hearing or \u201cangry outbursts\u201d in order to prevent him talking about some other thing he  does in the future. I think you should keep bringing it up and watch how he changes the story up because he can\u2019t keep his lies straight.

It happens this way all the time and it should not. They can and should give you 45 seconds for a last hug and I love yous. And they should stop for 30 seconds facing you and explain where to go to wait. You are NTA for thinking about this but you are the AH to keep bringing it up to your partner.

When i tried to talk to him about his behavior, he would find a way to deflect the situation on me and i was blamed for something out of the blue. Arguments were one sided, i was never able to explain how i felt about stuff whitout him telling me i was gaslighting him and arguing. \n\nWhen he was in a good mood though he was amazing.  He love bombed me: i was the most intelligent woman he met, he bought me little gifts, gave me the sweetest smile, talked about projects and activities to do together, etc. \n\nBut when he was angry... i was the most selfish person ever, i was making him go back into depression, i was the reason he was having the worst days at work, he never dated soneone who gaslighted him so much, etc. I was constantly worried that i was guilty for his poor mental healt and if i were to leave, he would hurt himself since he didn't have a good support system. \n\nHe made me feel like i was overthinking stuff when i felt bad after he snapped, making me feel like i was insane for thinking he was angry, etc. \n\nI was with him 4 months only, but i am still recovering from this relationship 2 years later.
