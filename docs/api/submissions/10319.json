It was and still is a very hard time for me to deal with but that\u2019s a different story. On the day that my dad passed, my mom was in the hospital for a number of different reasons and it someone got back to her best friend that my dad had passed and the children were at home alone. For reference, the oldest child is 22 (me) and the youngest was 17. When I was first informed that the best friend who I\u2019ll simply refer to as B, would be coming to clean the house, I had just watched as they wheeled my dad out. The sadness and grief that I was feeling quickly turned to anger and rage as B and I have had issues in the past. To avoid further conflict with B, I walked down to my aunts house and proceeded to space out. That is until my brother, the 17 year old, came and told me that B was here and that she expected us to get out ass up there and clean. I simply stated to my brother that I would not be returning to the house until I felt like it. He returned a few minutes later to tell me that B said she was in charge and my mother until further notice. Something inside me snapped. I had been taking shit from this women since I was 14 and in that moment I no longer could. As I walked out of my aunts house and crossed the driveway to my house, everything this woman had ever said to me and every name she had ever called me came crawling back into my mind. When I got into the house, she immediately acted all sweet and tried to get me to understand that she was my mom while my mom was in the hospital. I couldn\u2019t form exactly what I wanted to say so I simply told her to get the hell out of my house and no one needed to be in it at that very moment. She refused and kept insisting that we need to clean. In not so many words I told her to fuck off because I can\u2019t stand her. She smiled and said that\u2019s okay because she\u2019s my mom\u2019s best friend and I don\u2019t have to like her. For the first time that day I smiled and let out a laugh and said my mom doesn\u2019t even fucking like you, she only tolerates you because your husband is her best friend. Everyone who was there that day is on my side and believes I was justified in saying what I said. My mom is still sort of mad at me for spilling the beans about her secret and thinks I should apologize to B. So, AITA?\n\n\nEdit.

That's before you consider the fact that they literally wheeled your father's body out barely an hour or two before that woman's arrival.    \n\n\nToo bad, so sad, she got what she deserved; and with all due respect to your mother, she should never have subjected all y'all to that woman in the first six places.", "NTA.

How she thought that what you needed was her turning up, cleaning and demanding you clean too, is beyond me. \n\nEven if she did think she was helping, the minute the responsible adult in the house-- you-- told her to leave, she should've got gone, instead of trying to be an authority figure and telling you she was your mother until your own mother comes home.\n\nYou have nothing to apologise for. This woman's behaviour was outrageous. She turned up at a horribly difficult time and proceeded to make a nuisance of herself.

You\u2019re grieving the loss of your dad and your mom is in the hospital. That\u2019s enough of a burden to bare.

There was no need to clean the house right at that minute and even if there were, you and your siblings had bigger things to deal with.

I\u2019m glad you stood up for yourself. I hope you continue to stand up for yourself. It\u2019s wrong your mother expects you to allow someone to disrespect you.

Nahhh, she can have fun crying in her car all she wants.", "YTA.  Not for telling her off but for throwing your mother under the bus.  That wasn\u2019t your place.", "Your Mom is mad at you for telling this woman how she is perceived by everyone in your family after she basically tried to dominate a bunch of young adults whose father had just died.

You can't delegate family responsibilities and grief at a time like this to someone outside the family.  You had every right to resent it forcefully.\n\nSometimes busy-work like cleaning help distract a grieving person from their loss. Otherwise, they can become paralyzed.  But of course this just delays things.  \n\nBut, you didn't need to drag your Mom into it at that difficult time.\nShe's grieving and suffering too.  Think about her too.\n\nP.S.  It is natural for you to be angry and strike out at what you see as unwanted impositions and intrusions.\n\nEdit:  While I don't think you owe the \"friend\" an apology; whether you might owe your MOTHER an apology is a different story.  Consider doing whatever you can to ease her burden.", "NTA\n\nAnd friends or not, I'd have told her once to leave the house and told her I'll treat her as an intruder afterwards."]}
