{"id": 21858, "submission_id": "14vvxua", "title": "AITA for telling my kids grandparents that they couldn't take just my oldest anymore?", "selftext": "So my oldest son (13) was 8 months old when I got together with my ex. He assumed the father role, as my son's father wanted absolutely nothing to do with him, and we ended up going on to have 2 more kids together before we split 4 years ago. My son's bio father refused to sign off his rights however (so my ex never adopted my son). My son is fully aware who his real father is and has spoken to him a few times on the phone starting last year. He has no desire to meet his real father in person for the time being. He calls my ex \"dad\" and my exs parents are very close to him as well and I love that my son has that. They never gave up on him, even after my ex and I split up and they still take all of the kids for visitation. \n\nBut the problems started happening in the past 2 years. Both my 2 youngest kids started developing behavioral issues that are rather hard to deal with. Both are in therapy and undergoing evaluations to see the deeper routed issues. What it appears to be thus far is the youngest having ODD and currently being tested for ADHD and they feel like my daughter (middle child) has developed attention seeking behaviors that stem from her younger brothers behavior. But as I said, it's very hard to handle. And unfortunately, since the behaviors started, their father stopped taking them on a normal basis and started taking the kids sporadically (like 1-2 times a year versus every other weekend). My ex's parents spend more time with our kids than he does and there's zero contact between him and I. All contact goes through his parents because him and I simply cannot get along due to this (I can't understand his reasoning and I pick fights about it- I'm the problem). \n\nAnyways, for the past year though.. my exs parents have been asking for my oldest son a lot. They want to bring him racing, camping and to amusement parks but when they have all the kids, they just sit at home. The most they do is go swimming. They said they can't handle their biological grandchildren and that their \"bonus\" grandbaby is much easier and more fun to be around. I get it, truly, but I still don't think this is even remotely fair. So they took all 3 kids for the past weekend and when they came to drop them off, they asked me to take my oldest for the week. I said no and explained that it's really not fair because the other two wanted to go. Both my oldest and the grandparents are rather pissed at me right now. Apparently they banked on me saying yes and booked a camping trip at a spot my son loves. AITA?\n\nETA: my other two kids are 12(f) and 10(m). I don't expect them to take all 3 kids on these fun trips. I just don't like that they only extend one on one visits with my oldest- despite me offering them to take my middle child (especially since she is a Grammies girl) and me keeping my severe problem child home (he prefers being with me anyways). They always decline my offers but extend one on one invites to my oldest son only.", "created_utc": 1689000057, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vvxua/aita_for_telling_my_kids_grandparents_that_they/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your two other kids have behavior issues that the grandparents may not feel like they can control. Get your kids sorted out, keep grandparents up to date on meds and what works for the kids (routines rules etc) and then let them slowly build from there. This is going to take years, it won't be an easy overnight fix. \n\nMeantime, there's no reason your oldest shouldn't have some fun and some adventures. He shouldn't be held back because the other two have issues. That so just cause resentment and damage his relationship with them and with you. Your youngest two probably already take up more of your time and attention than he does. Let his bonus grandparents help compensate. \n\nSurely having one less kid in the house for the week makes your life easier? Unless you were counting on him to \"help\" you more since he's the \"normal\" one? \n\nAlso, if grandparents feel uncomfortable taking them places, once you get them on their meds or routine and they have started behaving better, maybe you can plan a few outings with the kids, yourself, and the grandparents. Let them see the better behavior and get comfortable with them in public.", "INFO: The oldest kid is 13, what are the ages of the younger ones?\n\nYou're positioning this as favoritism, but there are certainly activities more suited to tweens than toddlers and it's not wild for grandparents to spend individual time with grandkids.", "Going with YTA. I'm not understanding your reasoning.  If kids have behavioral issues that even you find it hard to handle, why you think family members are obligated to include them in all activities? Sorry, but it's a fact of life that they aren't going to be included all the time. \n\nIt's like a friend of mine and her kid. Her son has behavoral issues and is a big bully. No diagnosis, she just refuses to punish him, hold him accountable, and justifies his misbehavior. Then she is all butthurt when no one invites him to bday parties, no one attended his, and he doesn't have friends. Your siutation is different but similiar.", "YtA.\n\nWouldn't the oldest get resentful of the youngest ones.", "Yta - life isn't fair. It's not fair that your younger kids have issues. It's not fair that they're going to be treated differently. It's not fair that your oldest can't do things he wants because it doesn't include the youngest. \n\nYou need to realize that handling 1 kid without behavior issues is a lot different than handling 3, 2 with behavioral issues. They are old. They are not the parents. They don't have to be fair. All you're doing is depriving your oldest.", "YTA.  Your choices are negatively affecting your kids\u2019 lives in a few ways.   Your two younger kids are old enough to learn that \u201ckids who can\u2019t behave don\u2019t go fun places\u201d.  This is a powerful motivator and lesson.   Why would you both punish your one well behaved kid, the in-laws who are helping you coparent after you drive away their son (your words), and remove the life lesson/motivator to your problematic kids?", "I do think YTA. \n\nYoure punishing your oldest son for things that are absolutely not his fault.", "YTA. It sounds like your younger two take up a lot of your time, attention, and energy which most likely makes your oldest feel \"neglected\" a lot of the time, so let him have the extra grandparent time to try to make up for it a bit. \n\nNot only that, but, as they are older, they likely don't have the energy or stamina to keep up with high-needs kids for long and may choose to not take them camping or to the races out of fear of something bad happening and them not having the ability to properly handle such situations.\n\nAs your younger children progress through treatment and therapies, they will likely stabilize to a degree that their grandparents feel safe doing more things with them. It's just going to take time. In the meantime, don't harm your oldest by taking away somewhere he likely considers a \"safe space.\"", "YTA - How you feel on this situation is not your older son's fault nor the GP responsibility.\n\nIf the young ones feel left out then take them and do things with them when he is gone off. The younger ones can be reacting to your vibe and start to feel your feelings. As the parent its up to you to make this situation ok for all, but not by keeping one from doing something just because the others don't go.\n\nPut the others in sports or summer programs. Things like that often have good results with problem kids because it gives them structure and a goal and also gets them exposed to other kids. Also might help if you put one in a program and then spend 1 on 1 time with the other especially if  the older one is not around. They have groups for all kinds of kids your therapist can help guide you probably. But please don't punish the oldest one because you feel slighted on behalf of your younger two.", "Nah but I\u2019d let him go. None of this is his fault. Have an honest conversation with everyone about it. It\u2019s okay that the 2 youngest might not be ready to manage well in a new environment without becoming the focus of managing the entire time. It\u2019s ok for your oldest not to suffer missing opportunities to not have it always be about his youngest siblings. This is just the reality. Just make sure that they do take all of them to visit at least 1/2 the time so the the younger ones still can be involved with them and loved equally. It\u2019s your responsibility to get the other 2 help and to a place eventually that they could manage and enjoy those activities without ruining it for everyone else. I\u2019m sorry their dad is a deadbeat.", "YTA. Life is already not fair for you eldest as his bio father wants nothing to do with him. So life could just continue to be not fair.", "[deleted]", "YTA. It sounds like they are not able to handle the behavior issues. Why should that mean your eldest son doesn\u2019t get to spend time with them and have fun?", "YTA\n\nYour oldest behaves himself, so gets rewarded by his grands and the other two don\u2019t behave so they don\u2019t get to do fun stuff.  Preventing the oldest from doing fun stuff just makes him unhappy.  Let him go have fun.  Maybe the other two can take a turn going to the grandparents by themselves if they can meet behavior expectations.", "YTA. Don't punish your oldest for being a good non problematic kid. If your other kids  don't have friends and can't do any sports or go to any extracurricular activities, it means their behaviour is really bad.", "I don\u2019t want to pile on you because I have absolutely been in your shoes, i ways we could talk about for hours. Here\u2019s the truth of it though, life isn\u2019t fair. I don\u2019t mean that against you. Hear me out. Your eldest has had his share of bad breaks in life too, so if this is the one area where he is favored, let him have it. He has lost two dads, has two siblings that take up 90% of your time (no judgment at all) and has all the weirdness of being the only \u201chalf sibling\u201d in a household. Please just let him have this. Even if it is a little tough to swallow as a mom, he probably really relies on these time outs from the siblings. You\u2019ve been dealt a tough hand and I have so much empathy for you. Give him the break life hasn\u2019t given you. I wish you so much luck and support. \n\n\nAlso as a side note, try not to alienate the exes parents, if he\u2019s a dick it will always be easier for you if you\u2019re on good terms with them. Even if just to make your own life simpler.", "NAH. I understand the desire to make things fair between your children. You are, however, blocking your eldest from having a good time and I don't understand that at all. You've admitted that your youngest two are a handful and I would assume their behaviour is too unruly for their grandparents. You aren't going to win this. You're just going to cause resentment with your son and potentially damage that relationship. I'm pretty sure that's not the goal you have in mind. I'd re-think your strategy. Just my two cents.", "NTA, when I was growing up my half brother was invited to my grandparents because my bio gf was married to his fathers bio mom.  While I was a few years older and didn't really want to spend a great deal of time with them, I will never forget how it felt to not be included or even asked.  It's great they want to spend time with them, but they have two other grandchildren. Maybe if they just took them for a small trip, to go get ice cream or something to make them feel special, then taking only the 13yo may not hit them so hard. Hit them it will though.", "NTA - I\u2019d go as far as to suggest their preferential treatment has had some impact on your younger children\u2019s behavioral issues as well. I think it\u2019s great they take your oldest on special trips and should still get to once in a while but if they can\u2019t make an effort with all your children, they shouldn\u2019t get to spoil only one.", "YTA, since it's the eldest child, it would have been easy to explain to the others that they'll get to go when they're old enough and can behave. \n\nI also wonder, can you ever take your middle daughter alone to the grandparents? I suspect she would calm down a lot without the presence of her brother. She might stop seeking attention if she actually gets some attention. Once grandparents learn this, they may be more willing to take her alone, or the older 2 together.", "YTA\nLife is unfair. The grandparents are not obligated to help you with your kids. They are also not obligated to fake a closeness that doesn't exist with your younger children. I'm sorry that the grandparents don't feel the same connection to your younger kids. But, why should your oldest be punished because you want to use him to exert control over the grandparents? The only one doing something wrong here is you.", "NTA - Your children will never question who your favorite is, but they will know who their grandparents favor. As a lifelong \"lesser than\" grandchild growing up, it really stung. I didn't go to my grandfather's funera in large part of this type of thing. \n\nGrandparents are double in wrong for scheming behind your back with your kid. Not acceptable.

The grandparents are older now and may not be able to handle your younger kids on bigger trips like camping, even without their issues. You're also doing a disservice to your oldest because he's now in a house where his two younger siblings need more attention and you are denying him the opportunity to get some singular focused attention that you probably can't provide right now.\n\nIn the end it's impossible for all your kids to have the same experience for many reasons. Right now you're just punishing your oldest for being not needing as much help as the others.", "Sorry, but YTA.  Your son has already lost two \"dads\" who spend very little time with him, and now you're trying to deprive him of two grandparents that want to. \n\nAnd remember,  he is not their bio grandchild,  but they love him like he is. That is a rare gift you are trying to take from your son.", "NTA but I think this needs looking at a differnt way.  You son does not deserve to be punished for being a neuroypical child. Your other children should not be punished for being neuro diverse.   I say this with neurodiverse children myself. \n\nThe grandparents should not have made a promise to you son, or booked anything without a discussion with you. And it's not fair that you are being made out to be a bad guy because you were blindsided.  The children are close in age and they eillpick up the favourites vibe. That will cause more conflict. \n\nThree children is hard on anyone, and I realize you are probably exhausted. However,  why don't the children visit the grandchildren one at a time.   So if one gets a week, the others get a week.   The one with ODD is a bit different because that is a very challenging condition to manage.   I don't know what age the grandparents are  or physical health. If they feel they can not manage him safely then he should not be put in that position.  However there is no reason, either you can take him somewhere, and ask the grandparents to take the other two. Or find a camp that will understand and work with his condition. \n\nThey all need time to be them, they all need one to one. But they all have very different needs.  Do you have any other support aside from family? Are there any charities that can help you with holidays. In the UK we have specialist holiday centres that cater for family's with neurodiverae children and they're siblings. So everyone gets a break. \n\nYour son needs to feel he is not left out because his siblings are getting more of your attention. It could push him away when he's older. It will develop resentment between them all.  Everyone needs a break. Including you, I think separately would give you all a chance of getting some respite.", "YTA\n\nI have a teenager with ADHD and ODD and it is extremely difficult at the best of times. I would never expect anyone else to handle his poor behaviour (side note - he\u2019s much better behaved now than he was a small child because he\u2019s learned how to manage his condition over time). \n\nYou should explain to your kids that their grandparents love them but they don\u2019t love when they misbehave. Actions have consequences and they don\u2019t get to do fun things if they misbehave. \n\nHaving ADHD isn\u2019t a free pass. It just means that your children need extra support.", "The other two are 12 and 10. So, I understand it quite a bit, I truly do.

So OP is depriving him of that.", "I'm not sure. As is he currently gets to do everything they don't and I know life isn't fair but it's hard for me to watch my younger two feel left out all the time. My oldest is in sports programs, has multiple friends visits a week, etc and my younger two don't have that at all. They are just always home with me. My oldest is hardly ever home. I don't expect the grandparents to take all 3 of the kids at one time (that's a lot) but I do want them to extend the same one on one visits with their other two grandchildren like they do the oldest. I've offered one on one with them and my daughter (who isn't a problem child unless my youngest is around) and they never accept those invites but will ask for my oldest not even a week later. Its taking a huge toll on the younger ones, who now feel like their grandparents don't like them.", "This.\n\nThis becomes an issue  where the \u201cwell\u201d child becomes resentful of their siblings, because they end up missing out, getting less attention and expected to compromise all the time. \n\nAs the above poster said - life isn\u2019t fair.

My oldest child is hardly ever home between sports, friends, and his rec program activities- something my two younger kids are not able to do due to their behavioral issues. Therefore my oldest son has more fun in general because he isn't a problem child and is allowed to do so many things that the other kids cannot. \n\nI also never stated that I expected them to take all 3 children on these fun activities.
