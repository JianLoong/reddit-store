Whether or not your brother is struggling, the simple fact is that he is not struggling nearly as much as his 14-year old son who is doing his job as well as trying to live his own life. Don't matter how strong a kid is, this is not his role or his responsibility. On the other hand it's not easy to give a good solution that'll help the family rather than just making things worse.", "NTA - I'd call a family meeting and get your parents and others involved - anybody who might be able to help. It's understandable that your brother is devastated, but it's his responsibility as a parent to get the help he needs to take care of his kids. This nonsense your sister said about your nephew being stronger than his father is ridiculous - there's honestly nothing worse than family members excusing and turning a blind eye to child neglect.\n\nIf your family won't get together and make a plan to get your brother help and insist that he take it, it's time to contact the school social worker and let them know why your nephew has been missing so much school. That will get the ball rolling for the wakeup call your brother needs.", "NTA, your brother is neglectful and shouldn\u2019t be trusted with his kids if he can\u2019t care for them. What he\u2019s doing is abuse", "NTA.  Your brother needs to get it together and be the parent his kids deserve.  He may need counseling or meds. His son shouldn't be shouldering this burden", "NTA. \n\nIt does sound like your brother is experiencing depression and is struggling. But to your point, that is not an excuse to leave the care of his children in the hands of his 14 year old. \n\nHe needed this wake up call that he's failing and others are seeing it. If he needs help, then he needs to ask for it from another adult in his life, not his child.", "No matter what crisis he\u2019s in, he is clearly unfit to be a parent right now. Someone needs to take the kids away. \n\nMissing a week of school is horrible. The kids need a new living environment.", "NTA and it sounds like your brother is depressed but rather than have therapy and talk to people to support him, he's just thrusting every bit of responsibly to his eldest and that is not ok. \n\nSometimes tough love and a harsh word is what is needed so hopefully he bucks his ideas up cause it's hard fair on his 14 year old son and likely in later life will resent his Dad and go LC or NC", "Very slight NTA.\n\nI get why you did what you did, but it didn't accomplish anything.   The 14 year old now has to deal with an enraged and probably still useless parent.   On top of managing his sisters. \n\nIf you really want to help at this point, start taking a hard look at getting someone else custody of these kids. \n\nYour brother is hurting but he is forgetting his responsibility to his kids.", "ESH. Yes, he should be doing more to seek counseling, but the dude is clearly in the midst of a full on breakdown. You saying this like you did added nothing except animosity to the conversation. What he needs is SUPPORT.", "YTA b/c rather than you and your sister STEPPING IN to offer support to an obviously overwhelmed family unit while your brother is clearly in a mental health crisis, your concept of \"helping\" is to scream. That's not helping. That's shaming.\n\nLike, obviously that family needs HELP. How did what you do HELP?", "ESH. Ex-SIL is shitty for the obvious reasons. Your brother needs to see a goddamn therapist and raise his kids. But you? You just yelled at a man who is in a crisis as a knee jerk reaction. I get it. I\u2019d be furious with seeing all that and after that conversation. Yet, I can\u2019t help noticing that you didn\u2019t talk to your brother before talking to your nephew. From your story, you just saw he was asleep and left it, and it makes me question how much care you actually have for your brother. Or why you didn\u2019t make a move to have a healthier intervention earlier. If you did, edit with that info, because an hour of travel isn\u2019t much of an excuse to me to not have a conversation before this pushing for therapy. My sibling and I live in different time zones and still regularly check in with lesser parenting and mental crises than abandonment by our partners. If it just a matter of you not being that close to your brother, then that makes it even more aggravating to get yelled at like that and that much less your place to be the one to try to give him that lecture. Really, where the hell were you for him before it got to this point?", "ESH - how are you sure what your brother is doing all day in the first place, if you live an hour away? Maybe you're right, or probably you are right, but maybe you're not and he tries his best and just needs help?\n\nBeeing concerned for your family and looking for them is actually pretty good. But running into your brothers room, shouting some stuff and leave, wont help at all. It probably makes it worse...\n\nI would call your brother, apologize and try to talk to him. Ask how hes doing, how you can help, just be there for him, regardless of your dissappointment.", "YTA. Both your brother and his kids need therapy. It's he doing the parenting thing right? No, it looks like he's crawled into a depression cave to (metaphorically) die. But shouting at him and insulting him is just gonna make it worse", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not sure how you arrive at \"[14yo] is clearly a wreck too, but he doesn\u2019t act or look like he is.\" \n\nAll I know from your story is that you drove an hour to wake your brother up from a nap. Then  you scolded him because you don't approve of his housekeeping or the 14yo's school attendance habits. He did what I would expect him to do.", "Truancy officers will be called if he misses much more and parents can go to jail in some states or have their kids taken away if that happens.", "Are you calling the one person keeping the kids together an asshole? The 14 year old that is essentially a father to his siblings because his father; AN ADULT, can't get his shit together? So the adult is allowed to ignore his responsibilities, his children, so long as he's 'sad'? People like you are why kids like the 14 year old exists. You enable and excuse people who have no business having kids if they're too selfish to even take care of said kids.", "Alright then. I give my brother half my pay check. My dad moved his kids in for a month when they first separated. My sister and I took my brother on a trip to his favourite place a couple weeks back. My mom takes the younger two out every other weekend. I sometimes take all the kids (including mine) on outings. My sister\u2019s husband is a lawyer and is helping my brother with his wife. For the first 6 months, I used to come over to the house 5 times a week to clean, make my brother and his kids meals and cheer them up. \n\nIs it not obvious that this was a last straw?

It\u2019s not hard to notice, especially with teenage boys. \n\nAnd that is what I did. As a parent, he is 100% responsible for the housekeeping and his son\u2019s attendance.

Your nephew is being parentified to the point he missed an entire week of school. It\u2019s obviously been going on for most of the year since your brother and his wife separated based on how much your older nephew has changed. Your brother doesn\u2019t need an apology, he needs to realize he\u2019s neglecting and abusing his children by not stepping up to handle his emotional and mental health state. It seems well past the time for gentle encouragement and needs to get into therapy. And honestly, you telling him is better than one of your nephews teachers reporting him to CPS which I highly doubt he\u2019s thought of based on how caught up in his own feelings and mental state he is. He\u2019s putting himself first and not his kids.", "Are you a psychiatrist or a psychologist? If not then you have no right to assume how anyone feels about about anything. And I'm guessing you came for my household where kids didn't have to do chores. How lucky you must have been because where I grew up it's common for kids to be able to pick up after themselves especially when they're 14.

Instead of helping himself get better he's still in the same position as when his wife left except now he doesn't even know what's going on with his children. Mental illness is no excuse to neglect your children especially when you have the support like the brother did consider his parents and his 2 sisters have all pitched in to help. At some point, he needs to help himself but it's not just him he has to think about. He has 3 children he is neglecting.\n\nAlso, no comment about the parentified 14 year old?

Chores is cleaning your room, washing dishes, throwing out garbage, babysitting your siblings on occasion even. \n\nChores are NOT practically raising your little sisters while dad either sleeps or drinks all day, skipping every day of school because you\u2019re too tired, getting a job and using that money ONLY to buy diapers, baby formula etc. \n\nBut you\u2019re right about one thing, I was probably a pain in the ass and I will apologize regardless.", "I don't see where this behavior has occurred the entirety of the year, just that this is where he is now.", "Is it common sense for strangers, who don't know you and have only read a single account of the situation in which the only thing you did was scream, to assume that up until this point you've been nothing but giving and accommodating?\n\nI mean, not really. If you tell me a story about your dog biting, and that's the only story I've heard about that dog, I wouldn't consider it common sense to assume that the dog is usually very friendly and this was an exception.\n\nIt isn't reasonable to supply a single data point and then expect others to simply assume that all of your behavior outside of the data point you provided is the exact opposite to said data point.", "A 14 year old doesn't start taking over parental duties for younger siblings overnight.
