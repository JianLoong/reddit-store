If you did, edit with that info, because an hour of travel isn\u2019t much of an excuse to me to not have a conversation before this pushing for therapy. My sibling and I live in different time zones and still regularly check in with lesser parenting and mental crises than abandonment by our partners.

Carrying adult responsibilities at that age will not actually make him stronger and will traumatize him for life.\nDo your research. Stress only leads to more resilience if it is moderate, predictable and controlled. If it is unpredictable, severe and prolonged it leads to vulnerability instead of resilience.

He had to watch his baby brother, helped with potty training and walking him to the bus and homework and dinner and bedtime\u2026 parenting, basically, starting at 11. He started working full time, which isn\u2019t technically legal, at age 14. By his junior year of high school he figured out exactly how many days of school he could cut without being held back or expelled. He missed exactly that many, aced every test, and turned in the minimum homework necessary to graduate because he was working full time overnights washing dishes. He rode a bicycle about 10 miles to and from work and only had one uniform which had to be washed every day, and on one shitty occasion, during his lunch break. He went from valedictorian as a sophomore to passing with a C/D average as a junior.\n\nBTW kids you can hide from truancy officers in the public library. Or you could in the 1990s before they had computers and internet. You can also sleep in toilet stalls. People will assume you are homeless, not truant.\n\nMy husband did all of this because he was so terrified that CPS would get involved and break up what was left of his family. His dad worked two or three jobs and basically drank what little time he was at home. His middle brother started out working but switched to selling drugs. His youngest brother was an innocent little baby who didn\u2019t know any other way of living and didn\u2019t remember home cooked breakfast or clean sheets. My husband is in his 40s now and still un-fucking this shit in therapy. His dad used to call my husband his \u201cbest friend\u201d and now his dad\u2019s girlfriend tries to guilt trip him into calling.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s where your nephew is headed.

Your brother is failing his children, those children need adults that will protect and help them. Your sister needs a reality check. What kind of persons says something like that about a kid. Yes the kid is strong, that doesn't make his the adult of the household. Your brother needs a kick in the ass, as we would say in my country.", "OP, is there a chance you, sister, your parents can take the children? Worst case scenario each of you one? That would be better than neglect or foster care. Because this way they are with people they know and they can still have a siblings relationship. \nYou are nta, your brother needs therapy and pull up his pants for his kids. Anger is better than no feelings at all.", "NTA\n\nThe other sister is awful for saying that, the kid is not stronger, he has been forced to become stronger for survival. That is so maddening and while their mother is an AH, it's not your job to keep her in check. I'd be more mad at my own brother too. \n\nIt's one thing he's pathetic but for your sister to say that shet just makes me so mad", "Truancy doesn't really work the same as it used to. There may still be some places where that's true, but it's extremely unlikely now.\n\nTruancy officers barely exist at all, even in states where they're supposed to have them. I work in child safety and we have kids fairly regularly who are missing 40% _or more_ of school days.\n\nThe US has been all over the place, often one state will enforce attendance rigorously while the next will be much more generous.\n\nIn low income areas, it's actually more common for them to enforce policies too harshly because they want seats filled so they get money. Or like where I am now, families have needs that are so acute that the kids are missing school but there's no real safety net and we know it would be worse for the kids to go into foster at that moment.\n\nOne of the reasons administrative costs keep skyrocketing for schools is because it seems we have to learn over and over again that kids are individuals and families have unique situations and everything needs to be taken into account.\n\nA few years ago we were working with three different families in the same school district.\n\n* One had a serious medical issue involving multiple surgeries and hospitalization, and may ultimately be terminal and her school was bizarrely insistent on attendance anyway because the principal of that school was educated in the 90s when It was more likely that schools pushed the \"kids have to be in school no matter what\" narrative.\n*The other kid broke her leg at the beginning of the school year and the school refused to make it so that she could safely get from class to class without reinjuring her leg so she just stopped going. They are refugees and no one spoke English well enough to know how to stand up for her. She tried to reintegrate back into the classroom but was so far behind already that she couldn't catch up and going was too difficult and felt useless.\n* The third kid was just uninterested in going to school. He lived with his dad who was an alcoholic and didn't make it so he didn't. The school district also seemed like they just...didn't care that much.\n* The fourth kid kept being violent for multiple reasons at school, and even when he went to a nontraditional school, his reputation followed him and he also got kicked out of those. He wasn't motivated to do independent schooling so he'd constantly bounce back and forth between trying to go back to regular school, going to alternative school, and then independent learning. I'm pretty sure he had some sort of significant developmental delay that caused him to be unable to control his temper but by the time it was evident, he was already extremely resistant to any type of testing or engagement. The school would schedule testing and he would sit there angrily and refuse to participate.\n\nAll of these kids were in the same district! Different schools, but it's the same district. Absolutely wild. I also lived in another state where as soon as kids hit too many absences, they referred them to juvenile justice and they went on juvenile probation!\n\nTldr: this comment kind of got away from me. This deadbeat dad sucks and is parentifying his child and education is really expensive and complicated.", "Yeah, if I was OP i would not be banking on that.\n\nFrankly, I'd have called CPS from the car as soon as I left. That poor kid should not be made to be responsible for his siblings for a single minute longer.", "I don't know when the last time you interacted with the system was but that is absolutely not the case any longer unless it is extraordinarily egregious. Even education neglect is much more complicated these days. Truancy isn't treated the same way it was even 5 years ago, much less 10.\n\nI work in child safety (although I've never worked for CPS, only in partnership) so this is actually something I've seen happen pretty quickly. I've also worked in quite a few states at this point.\n\nCPS is horribly underfunded and unfortunately a lot of their decisions are driven by awful laws put into place by people who don't do what's best for children. But please, please don't perpetuate myths or assume that your experience is similar to everyone else's. CPS in most places is getting extremely good at getting the families connected to the resources they need. And telling people not to intervene when they maybe should is too far in the other direction, It will absolutely get kids killed and abused. And I say all of this as someone who is no fan of CPS.\n\nI'm so sorry all of that happened to you, part of the reason I went into child safety was because when I was a child, my abusive parent was able to manipulate the CPS worker because they were overworked, so his abuse went on for many more years. I know how much it hurts when the system fails you or actively hurts you.", "Don\u2019t know about most places but my bestie picked up her son from school and he hadn\u2019t bathed in days, his clothes were dirty and didn\u2019t fit and reeked of smoke, and his *shoes were too small.* She stopped on her way home to buy him a whole new outfit and bagged up everything he was wearing including the shoes which were 2.5 sizes smaller than his feet. She called CPS on her ex. Her son\u2019s teacher also contacted CPS to support her. Friend showed pictures, texts, school reports, screenshots from FaceTime with her son of his dad\u2019s place, and even the baggie of rank clothing to CPS worker. Case worker refused to smell the clothing, dismissed all evidence, drove away. This boy wasn\u2019t showering, was sleeping on the floor, his family was hoarding, he was being bullied at school for smelling like BO and smoke, he was falling asleep from having no bed time etc.\n\nThey went by ex\u2019s apartment to check on the state of the place and he pretended not to be home while sending my friend threatening messages which she forwarded to caseworker to prove he was home. Case worker left and came back five days later, said the home was clean and there was no evidence anything was wrong, and she opened a case on my friend based on one conversation with the ex and no evidence at all.\n\nSo, um\u2026 yeah. There are gigs of data about this asshole abusing and neglecting his son and yet CPS gave him a warning and 5 days before a home inspection and his place looked like Hoarders crossed with My Strange Addiction before. That was maybe two years ago. It\u2019s not ancient history.", "So here's the really difficult situation CPS is in - they are absolutely bound by all sorts of rules and regulations. In some states, I could have a child removed from a home because they were wearing seasonally inappropriate clothing twice. In others I couldn't get children removed from the home despite the fact that they were being sexually abused. \n\nAnd neglect is incredibly difficult. Unless it's an infant or toddler, most states are going to be bound by this unending obsession with a family unification.\n\nThere's also another element here - It can actually matter who makes the report, how many reports are made, and how many are made over time.\n\nAlso, people in this field of work don't need to smell some dirty clothes? That seems like a very strange thing to be upset about. They hear and see and smell all kinds of stuff all the time, anything that could be denied in court is pretty complicated. Parents will often say things like my kid hates bathing and he had plenty to eat, he chose to wear those shoes, I told him to throw them out a while ago. And if there's food in the fridge and shoes he could be wearing, CPS usually can't act. Hoarding is also in that really tough area, we live in a country that's absolutely obsessed with parents' rights over their children, and in limiting the government's ability to decide what's safe or even ideal for children. If the child is reasonably safe, especially if they are older than five or six, it's essentially impossible to get them out of many of those situations in a lot of states. Caseworkers also must give the parent 5 days notice before a home inspection in most cases.\n\nThere are just way way WAY too many kids in immediate need. And yes, there are some bad CPS workers and you may have met one, but on the whole they genuinely do try to do their best by kids whenever possible. And honestly, in this case, it sounds like there were other routes the mother should have taken. CPS will often be unable to intervene when another parent should be interviewing in another way. For example, your friend should have asked for an emergency custody hearing. I know that not a lot of parents know that, but when you share custody with someone, that's the best way to do that. Family Court judges have a lot more leeway.", "The clothing reeked *of cigarette smoke and marijuana.* sorry I was unclear but a third grader shouldn\u2019t be able to chose to smell like tobacco and marijuana. That\u2019s why she wanted the worker to smell it and that\u2019s why the kids were bullying him so badly.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t bathing because his grandpa kept busting into the bathroom \u201cto help him\u201d wipe his privates.\n\nYou need your own lawyer to file. Legal aide won\u2019t handle custody cases. So yeah, my friend was aware it wasn\u2019t the best answer, but between the smoking, drug use, signs of sexual abuse and neglect, it was the only opening.", "NTA.

He's still responsible for the kids, and he still has to take care of them.\n\nI get that it's hard; my partner has lifelong depression, but even at his lowest he will make sure the kids are taken care of physically and at least try to pretend he's doing okay in front of them. We're open about it with them (eldest is a teenager and has the same condition), and my partner apologises when he knows he's in a funk.
