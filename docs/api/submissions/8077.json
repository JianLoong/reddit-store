It's understandable that your brother is devastated, but it's his responsibility as a parent to get the help he needs to take care of his kids.

Or why you didn\u2019t make a move to have a healthier intervention earlier. If you did, edit with that info, because an hour of travel isn\u2019t much of an excuse to me to not have a conversation before this pushing for therapy. My sibling and I live in different time zones and still regularly check in with lesser parenting and mental crises than abandonment by our partners. If it just a matter of you not being that close to your brother, then that makes it even more aggravating to get yelled at like that and that much less your place to be the one to try to give him that lecture.

It sucks that brother is depressed (if that is the case) but that doesn't make it okay to force his oldest kid to take care of all his other kids, and to give up his own schooling to do so! \n\nAlso, in response to the sister \"our nephew is a strong kid, stronger than our brother\" --- KIDS AREN'T SUPPOSED TO BE STRONGER THAN THEIR PARENTS. That's awful that the sister seems to just be okay with this.", "I doubt it was a wake up call. He'll use this experience as another excuse to wallow some more.", "1000% agree with contacting the school social worker. That\u2019s a must.", "Missing school; home is a mess; one child caring for others.  OP, it sounds like your nieces and nephews would be better off in foster care where they would go to school; live in a clean environment and have meals prepared.", "I hate anyone who says that strong shit about kids. I was one just like that, people even would acknowledge I was so much more mature than the adults in my life and did such a good job with my little brother, I was so strong. So they saw it, but no one ever helped us. Being a strong kid sucks, it's exhausting, stressful, steals your childhood, and leaves you with so much trauma to deal with as an adult. I wanted to be a kid/teenager, not the responsible one at 10. Not driving drunk adults home at 12. It's an awful way to grow up, and I'm still dealing with a lot of myself that finally broke down after all those years. \n\nSorry for all that! Tldr: kids should not have to be the strong ones, don't hurt them like that, let them be kids. Op, nta.", "I'm guessing you didn't write your state's truancy policy, so please don't take what I'm about to say personally. I know you're only relaying facts.\n\nI think this policy is incredibly stupid. I don't think kids should constantly miss school, but there were HS classes I could have aced without showing up for anything but the tests. Again, I'm all for making sure kids are in school, but failing them purely because they missed 11 days in a semester if they're still learning everything they need to learn doesn't seem like a very good idea.", "While the brother definitely needs to make changes, I think this sounds overly rosy about foster care. Literally the most likely outcome for the 14 year old would be to never graduate high school and to end up in jail.", "Yah that's very concerning - you are a great aunt/uncle", "He's not going to graduate highschool now if he keeps missing school to do his dad's job.\n\nIf he misses much more school he's at risk of being held back or expelled.", "Most of the people here are little kids and have no life experience. Almost every post there are a bunch of people yelling Y-T-A at the most ridiculous things. You can usually tell by lots of all-cap words and exaggerations. You are obviously NTA and doing the best you can for your brother and his kids.", "NTA.  Call CPS and report that his children are being neglected.  Sooner or later the school is going to report your nephew's truancy.  You may as well do something to help those kids.", "NTA, please call CPS to check on them.", "NTA \n\nI'd call the school or CPS. Someone needs to give your brother a kick in the ass to parent.", "NTA. However, the kids have another parent. Did you also call your ex-SIL to yell at her? This is much of her doing as his.", "NTA\nThose poor kids. You brother is just as much of an AH as his wife. BOTH of them abandoned their kids. Are there any family members they can stay with? This is some CPS shit but I\u2019d hate for them to be separated. Your bro needed a wake up call.", "ESH and Y T A if you don't get help for your nephew. Adultification is child abuse, and it is your duty to get authorities involved. If you don't want to call CSA call the school and tell the guidance councilor", "NTA\n\nAt this point, either the family steps in or the state will.\n\nThe best thing is to speak with the rest of your family and figure out who can step in to help the kids, and get your brother into counseling. \n\nAny chance the kids can live with someone else in the family For a few months?", "NTA. Your sister needs to be more concerned about the wellbeing of the CHILD. It doesn't matter is the child is strong. Your nephew is a CHILD. This is abuse and your sister is enabling him.", "NTA. Sounds like you and your family need to have an intervention", "NTA. Sounds like you and your family need to have an intervention", "NTA.  Parents struggle, but parent's still need to parent.  It is never the child's responsibility.  I remember when I got divorced my ex said something my 9 yo checking the water heater for leaks and it was his job to take care of things.  I interrupted mid sentence and said that I was the parent and it was MY responsibility to take care of things.  No child should have that burden.", "DCYF?", "INFO why did he separate from his ex wife + did she move so far away because she didn\u2019t want the children? Is she completely out of the picture?\n\nNTA, but you need to call CPS. As others have said, neglect is abuse and your eldest nephew risks losing a year of school.", "NTA at all. I'm surprised to see all the comments saying you \"didn't help anything\", when clearly everyone around your brother has been coddling him and has essentially allowed him to continue being neglectful FOR A YEAR. Sometimes, people need to be told off before they realize they can't continue ignoring their responsibilities.", "NTA\n\nJustifiable AH in my opinion. Was that a shitty thing to say? Yes. Did he need to hear it? Definitely.\n\nYour nephew deserves a childhood and a present father. Your SIL leaving is horrible, but sometimes you gotta roll with a shitty hand and that\u2019s what your brother has to do", "NTA.  This is my story.  When my ex left I had a two year old son to take care of.  \nAll I wanted to do was crawl in bed and cry.  That was not an option.\nMy boy literally required me to be there.  I had to put my big boy undies on just do it.\n\nI waited until after my son was asleep to let the sadness in then woke up and did it over again.\n\nYour bro needs some metal/emotional help.  He is doing his kids a disserve.  You can only help so much though.  Get him to see a doctor for some help in dealing with his depression.", "NTA  \nThose kids of his didn't ask to be put in the position that they're in either and it's still his responsibility as their parent to take care of them. He needs to figure it out asap. It also sounds like he needs some kind of professional help dealing with it. You were absolutely spot on for getting angry that your nephew was taking care of everything. I'd have gone even further and told him I was getting the school involved if he missed even one more day of school because he's too distraught to parent. Your nephew should not be missing school to take care of the rest of the family and you all not step in. Your sister is completely wrong here. Your nephew should never have to be that strong when the rest of you are there. Please continue to stick your nose in. Honestly I'd be mentioning CPS since he lives that far away. If he's going to claim to be unable to care for 3 kids then he shouldn't have them.", "NTA. I wish my dad's brother had done this.", "NTA\n\nIf you did not do it, CPS, and a judge will do it.\n\nNext time your sister calls, ask her is she able to take in 3 children?  Are your parents?  Or would they all prefer the children go into the foster care system?  Do they have lawyer money?  What happens when the lights and water gets shut off?  What happens when the school notices that one child has not been in school and sends officers to find out why and as a result CPS gets involved and removes them from the home?  \n\nWill she still think you were harsh?\n\nYour brother needs therapy, but you are right he needs to get his butt up and out of bed, get his head on straight, cause this is not about him, this is about his children that he is close to losing due to his inaction and neglect.  That the state of the house, that his oldest child is missing school and has not showered at all, having to care for his siblings will bring them in with a force he is not going to like and then have to deal with home visits and ect.  Not to mention about his job that may get tired of him not being there.", "NTA. Call CPS since your nephew is missing so much school to take care of his siblings. Maybe that will wake your brother up.", "Maybe see if the kids grandma could move in to help for a bit", "NTA. He does need to man up, his kids are more important than his failed relationship.", "NTA", "NTA call CPS", "Please call cps. Maybe you can adopt your nieces and nephews. But he is hurting them with his behavior", "Call a social worker or something, maybe that will wake him up. Doesn\u2019t matter to me how sad he is. He needs to be a father. NTA.", "NTA. If your nephew misses anymore school your brother will *go to jail* because truancy is not a joke. He needs to get his act together before he gets locked up.", "NTA\n\nYour brother is more concerned about losing his woman than he is for his kids losing their mom. Right now, he's letting his son take care of her duties and he's perfectly ok with it. Losing a spouse is hard but he doesn't get to disconnect from the kids with his wife. To me he's resenting his kids based on their mom. If he moves on, I feel that he'll discriminate his kids for the next set he may have.", "My dude, NTA.\n\nAnd you need to contact CPS. Because it is ILLEGAL for him to completely leave the care of HIS kids to his 14 year old. Especially if this means the 14 year old is MISSING school! Most states have Truancy laws on the books and THIS is an egregious violation that could land him in VERY hot water if the school discovers WHY the 14 year old is missing so much school! (Because little kids blab at the weirdest times along with the most random stuff so it could slip out!)\n\nAnd that BS your other sister spouted! NO! She is literally saying it's OK to break several state and federal laws regarding MINORS! Holy crap! NO!\n\nIf YOU don't make that call, then you ARE TA!\n\nGoodness! Your poor nephew and his siblings!", "NTA like others have said it looks like he\u2019s suffering from depression. But it\u2019s not an excuse to basically neglect your children. As someone who grew up in a single parent home who was suffering from severe depression. She tried her best, she always made sure I was taken care of. Yeah sometimes it meant a lot of fast food but I was fed, clothed, had a roof over my head and was going to school.  He\u2019s not even giving the bare minimum as a parent for your nephew but rather making him the new parent.", "Also that excuse about a 14 year old bring stronger than the brother is so stupid.\n\nThe 14 yr old shouldn't need to be stronger than the adult in the house. The 14 yr old should be the one breaking-down and falling a part. The kid might not even have time to process things himself because he is being forced to look after his siblings.", "NTA. OP, please call CPS. The 14 year old doesn't need to flunk out of school before people notice what's happening. They need to be stepping into this home and watching out for these kids.", "I disagree completely, metal health can always be used as a reason when it is a reason, that doesn't mean it is a justification or excuse.\n\n>If we aren\u2019t trying to better ourselves then we\u2019re just telling people ***(the reason)*** why we suck lol\u2026\n\nFix that for you.", "Tell him!!!", "[removed]", ">Mental health can only be used as a reason when you\u2019re actively working on being a better person, when you do nothing and drag everyone around you down, no one wants to hear your excuses.  That\u2019s the difference between people\u2019s reasons and your excuses, be transparent with your struggles, especially to yourself, only then can you grow and have less and less occurrences where you need a reason\n\nI'd be the one calling them and explaining why they need to be involved.", "Or with relatives.", "Do not apologize lovely human.\n\nThis is your experience, your truth.\n\nThe more we talk about it in the open, the more opportunities we have to normalize that these are things that happen to humans and we need to support not denigrate.\n\nI'm glad you shared.

So if you're not showing up, you're missing work.\n\n(I hated homework but if I wanted to maintain As I'd do it)", "As a former foster kid, you are not giving us enough credit. Most foster kids *do* graduate, and most are not criminals. It's always sad seeing people spew these false narratives. Sure some of them will, but to say *most likely* is a bit negative for no reason.", "I mean sure, you'd have to still turn in the homework to get credit for it even if you didn't come to class, and I'm not suggesting high school students should be allowed to just come and go as they please. But given the kinds of circumstances that folks like OP's nephew might be facing, I'm not a fan of a policy that says you miss 10 days and it's an auto-fail.", "And his dad is at risk for jail due to truancy, since he (I assume?) has custody.", "I'm glad you have a loving and functional family; given my lived experience, that kind of behavior is, unfortunately, within the realm of possibility for many families.\n\nSome families have wretched dynamics. We hear about them all the time in this very subreddit."]}
