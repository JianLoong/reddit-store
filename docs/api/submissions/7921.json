I wouldn't have even told him after he yelled at you not to touch there stuff.

You simply complied with that request.", "Dude, why would you pay anything?\nIf anything get a fence.", "NTA I wouldn't have said anything until they asked and I'd have played stupid when they did. \"How should I know where the scooter is, you told me not yo touch it, remember?\"", "Yeah.

You might want to spend some time thinking about whether you people please at expense to yourself and your partner. That's often a very lovely trait to have but it's important to learn how to suss out when someone is manipulating that instinct to take advantage of you. It sounds like that's what happened with this neighbor.", "NTA!", "Doesn't matter. It was not your fault. They should have been more responsible.", "This way you are teaching them that it\u2019s ok to treat you like that though. If they were really hurting for money, they wouldn\u2019t be leaving their possessions outside. Them losing the scooter was a result of their actions and had nothing to do with you, but paying them for it makes it look like it was your fault somehow.", "Nope.", "If the rental property includes the yard, and isn't an apartment complex where the yard is shared, then it doesn't matter. Its still your property and while I'm not sure what the law would be, I am sure the kids can't leave toys on your yard without permission (the same way they couldn't leave trash on your yard)", "I offered. Neighbor didn\u2019t bully me to pay.", "Seems like a very good lesson, it\u2019s a completely natural and logical consequence of both, the kids behavior of leaving their toys everywhere, and the moms request to not do anything.  Oh well, maybe they will finally learn but it is doubtful.  Frankly I\u2019d consider moving"]}
