I wouldn't have even told him after he yelled at you not to touch there stuff.

You rather let bully neighbor tell you what to do. Good luck with them. NTA", "While that was perhaps kind and generous of you, I feel that you were an asshole to yourself when you did that. You might want to spend some time thinking about whether you people please at expense to yourself and your partner. That's often a very lovely trait to have but it's important to learn how to suss out when someone is manipulating that instinct to take advantage of you. It sounds like that's what happened with this neighbor.", "NTA!", "Doesn't matter. It was not your fault. They should have been more responsible.", "This way you are teaching them that it\u2019s ok to treat you like that though.

Neighbor didn\u2019t bully me to pay.", "Seems like a very good lesson, it\u2019s a completely natural and logical consequence of both, the kids behavior of leaving their toys everywhere, and the moms request to not do anything.  Oh well, maybe they will finally learn but it is doubtful.  Frankly I\u2019d consider moving", "YTA for giving them money for no reason. Wtf.", "YTA grow a spine.", "NTA, but giving neighbor $50 was a mistake. You did nothing wrong.", "YTA but only because you're a doormat and you let your neighbours wipe their feet on you. Grow a pair of balls and stand up for yourself.", "NTA for leaving the scooter, but you are inviting drama by all your actions after that. There was no reason whatsoever for you to walk over there or tell the neighbor what happened and it was stupid to offer him money.", ">I offered 50 dollars. He took it, but said I was still an ass regardless.\n\nYTA for paying for something clearly not your responsibility.  This is so visible, even Ray Charles could see it.  And then the guy insults you after taking your money.  Stop being a pushover.  You are earning all of the bullying and disrespect your neighbors dishes out to you.", "NTA, they are. Leaving their stuff in your yard is disrespecting you and your property and then blaming you for the consequences of their actions is just icing on the cake.", "NTA.  The sad reality is that some people have to learn lessons through experience.", "NTA. You are too nice. Honestly, you should not have gone to theirs and see how long it would have taken them to notice! And giving $50 is really generous. The kids hopefully will learn their lessons but probably not. I imagine you don't like confrontation but let them know that the kids need to respect your property and if this continues you will not be responsible if any of their toys get damaged or trashed.", "NTA but next time don't tell them or pay anything", "YTA for paying him anything and even for calling him. Your property, they can keep their stuff off it. If it's by your trash and gets tossed, not your problem. Quit being too nice. They're rude and dont deserve you for a neighbor.", "YTA.  Not for what happened to the scooter, but for giving them $50.", "YTA for paying that $50. Expect to pay more, every time a toy is lost or broken.", "YTA! Not because you left the scooter by the trash can,  but for paying your neighbor $50.  Those kids need to learn that actions have consequences.   If they leave toys out,  they can get lost or stolen.   If I were you,  I'd start charging a finder's fee every time a toy is left in your yard.  Eventually the kids should learn to take better care of their things.", "Definitely NTA! You went above and beyond by offering $50 for the scooter, which wasn't your fault. Your neighbors are assholes that clearly don't take care of their things and haven't taught their children anything about respect or accountability. Sounds like it might be time to put up a fence! It's not up to you to clean up after them or offer reimbursement when the refuse company mistakenly takes things they leave out by the trash.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have paid him a thing.  I would tell him that if items are left on your property you will turn them into the police as lost items.   \n\nYou said they are hostile to you.

Why would OP even tell them what happened?  It's on them for leaving their crap out in the neighborhood.  And, why in the hell would OP offer them $50?  OP didn't do anything wrong but boy has OP set a precident.  Next time something happens to the kids toys/crap, guess who they are going to blame and expect to pay them - even though OP probably had nothing to do with it.\n\nOP - stand up for yourself more.  Don't let the AH's bully you.", "NTA, but you shouldn't have paid them a penny nor told them. If the kid would've gone to the parents to tell them the scooter was gone and they'd come to you, you could've just told them that the trash collectors likely took it as it was next to the trash, but you don't know anything about it. That it might be wiser if they keep their stuff with them from now on. \n\nAlso, good fences make good neighbors or make you at least not have to deal with the bad ones.", "NTA There was no need to go and tell them, they would find out for themselves and no need to pay him. You are a walking doormat.", "YTA but ONLY because you paid him.", "Why did you offer 50dollars??? They need to learn to parent and to pick things up.  \n\nYou now have assumed all liability for anything they leave that gets stolen or taken. Get a camera.  Tell them anything left on your property will be moved to the pavement outside your boundary lines.", "Nta. Such a dumb dumb. That was your chance to teach him a lesson, but you squandered it. On top of that you were willing to cover the cost. Wtf.", "YTA but not for what you think.  You gave him money to replace something his children were neglectful with.  Now watch the entitlement on his and his children\u2019s part explode.\n\nman oh man, you really screwed your self over, here.", "I wouldn't have told him anything. I would hurl the toys in his yard.", "Yeah, dude. You don't owe these people anything. The kids need to learn that if they leave their shit around the neighborhood, it might not be there when they get back. Clearly their parents arent teaching them so it is up to society.", "This.  I wouldn't have said anything to the neighbors at all.  They chose to leave their shit in the wrong yard, they get to deal with the consequences.", "He likely overpaid for the scooter too. They run about $25-30 \ud83d\ude2c", "I used to be, too. You grow out of it really quickly when you finally get sick of people's BS.\n\nYour time will come and you'll get to that place where you say, \"To heck.\" with these AHs.", "You need to remember that anger and being right are not the same. People are totally in the wrong and still get angry. You don\u2019t have to please that. In fact, I\u2019d argue that you shouldn\u2019t enable that.", "I'm starting to see why they walk all over you.", "If they dont have money they should tale care of their property. Yta for letting them walk all over you, i am begging you to grow a spine, genuinely please dont let people treat you this way :(", "You think your neighbor is continuously hostile to you because they can tell you're weak and have no spine? You're neighbor is clearly an asshole, but in being spineless to please others, you're constantly being an asshole to yourself and the people you care about because you're going to keep letting assholes like your neighbor steamroll over you and make your lives miserable. Are you planning to have kids? Are you planning on letting people steamroll them too because mommy won't stand up for them, or teach them to stand up for themselves? \n\nYou're willing to put yourself out there and let strangers rip you apart for being a coward, that takes some courage, channel that energy girl", "It's great to be kind, to those who'll be kind in return. You just let you're neighbor know he can essentially bully money out of you.", "Which was totally unnecessary to even offer. Was it kind of you? Yes, it was. \n\nI get the feeling you offered as a \u201cpeace\u201d offering hoping it would stop their bully behavior. Now that you see it didn\u2019t work, grow a spine and stick up for yourself. They are assholes and there is nothing you can do to change that. It\u2019s not a reflection on who you are. Some people are just nasty assholes. Best of luck with them in the future."]}
