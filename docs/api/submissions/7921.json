She heard what happened. She handed me the money back and said that her son is going to earn a new one by doing chores and saving money. She thanked me for giving the money, but she believes her husband guilted me in giving him the money. She knew my intention, but it wasn\u2019t teaching her son the right lesson. She said she\u2019ll make sure her children don\u2019t leave things in our driveway/yard.\n\nSo I think this was a good end to what\u2019s been annoying behavior by her kids.\n\nTo those who called me an asshole or otherwise for giving the money: the money was never an issue for me. Have I been taken advantaged of for my kindness? All the time. I\u2019ve learned to cut those people out of my life or next time I just say I don\u2019t have the money.

We\u2019ve lived here for three years now. These neighbors have been hostile to us. On several occasions, their kids left things in our yard during nighttime we\u2019ve politely moved them back to their yard. Never made a fuss about it. Thursday night, our neighbor yelled at us and was upset we moved things from our yard to theirs. I told them they need to keep their toys in their yard. He said to leave them and he\u2019ll get them in the morning. \n\nWell yesterday trash day. When I took the trash cans to the side of the road, the scooter was still in our trash can spot. I moved the scooter behind the trash cans because I wanted to honor the neighbor\u2019s request. Also, I assumed the trash collectors would leave it alone. I was in a work meeting that I was hosting (I work from home). I watched from the window as the trash collectors not only took the trash from the cans, but hurled the scooter into the trash. \n\nAfter my work meeting, I walked next door to explain what happened and he called me an asshole for not letting him know sooner.

These are not neighbors that wish to be friendly with you. I would be cordial but not friendly.", "I love this Malicious Compliance!", "I'm sorry, but that money might not even go to a new scooter. Its pretty common in these families for parents to just pocket money to get their own stuff. Like it won't be spent on bills, rents etc but rather on luxuries like perfume, make-up, high-end clothes and not to replace the scooter.\n\nI've known a family like that and in a similar situation (bike was stolen) they just kept the money and said it was \"to teach their son a lesson\". My parents are similar, in a sense too. It isn't exactly wrong behaviour if they've told their son to not leave his stuff lying around and I can understand why they wouldn't replace it in that case.\n\nNext time I would buy a new scooter and give that as a gift to the kid next Christmas/celebration or whatever.", "It sure sounds like you are slow.  You are paying a dude that is hostile towards you to be a bad parent.  I\u2019m sure that\u2019s in the DSM-5.", "The update is awesome. You really never should have paid for the scooter to begin with, the kids was irresponsible leaving his scooter in your yard by the trash, his parents were irresponsible for not teaching their kids in spite of many warnings, not to leave their toys in the yard. I'm really glad that the mother realized this and made things right. She could have done better earlier with just telling her kids to pick up the toys, but it sounds like this was a good lesson for the whole family, mom had learned her lesson, kids will be learning his lesson. The dad... well, hopefully his wife will be having words with him.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't owe them anything. They need to train their children to keep their toys in their own yard. I would just start throwing away all of the toys left in my yard. I wouldn't say anything. He doesn't want to teach the children what to do. He isn't doing what's necessary. He yelled at you for moving them out of your yard. So, throw them away. Load them up in a car & take them to a homeless shelter.", "NTA 100%. They left it there with the trash. Then you went out of your way to move it away from the trash pickup spot to protect it. You moved it to another spot in your yard to honor your neighbors (extremely rude and shouty) request not to move it back to theirs. The trash collector took it anyway. Then you had the courtesy to tell the neighbor what had happened AND you offered them $50 in compensation for the loss despite having no responsibility to look after the scooter yourself. I'd be tripping over myself in gratitude if I had a neighbor half as courteous as you.", "Nta", "NTA and you didn\u2019t owe them any money either", "NTA you tried being nice, confronted them about the situation, respected their wishes, and paid them for their inconvenience. While they still treat you like shit. I dunno how you kept it together.", ">To those who called me an asshole or otherwise for giving the money: the money was never an issue for me. Have I been taken advantaged of for my kindness? All the time. I\u2019ve learned to cut those people out of my life or next time I just say I don\u2019t have the money. So what if I wanted to give 50 dollars so a 6 year old boy could get a new scooter?\n\nSo, the problem is that when you do stuff like this it teaches them they can get away with it. Being an easy mark because you have the money just encourages them to go after other marks- some of which won't have the money.\n\nDon't give scammers money, even if you can afford it, because next time they might not be going after someone who can afford it.\n\nThat's what this was, by the way- a scam. \n\nThey either failed to supervise their young child or they knew exactly where he was and what toys he had. \n\nEither way that's not something you should be rewarding.", "NTA, but you should take a strong stance against their stuff in your yard.\n\nScooters are a trip and fall hazard. You could be badly injured.\n\nAlso, a guest of yours could be injured and file a claim against your homeowners insurance policy. This could raise your premium, cause your carrier to not renew your policy, make it\ndifferent to find another carrier and even make it difficult to sell your house.", "YTA. Being a people pleaser is almost as bad as actually being malicious.", "Nta", "Exactly, I wouldn't have even told them that you saw the scooter being taken. Then maybe they'd learn a lesson about leaving their shit where it doesn't belong; now they have an \"excuse\" to blame you.", "If it was that important why didn't they know where it was? Why didn't they supervise their small child if they're that tight on money?\n\nKid went out with toy, came in without it, and they didn't question where it was?\n\nAre you 100% certain it cost as much as he said it did?", "I think dad was trying to run a grift.\n\n\"lose\" something- usually belonging to your child- on someone elses property. Demand they replace it, naming a number higher than the original value.\n\nIt's a fairly common grift.", "I do have a spine. I think that\u2019s a bit uncalled for. No it wasn\u2019t really a peace offering. I just felt bad that the kid lost his scooter. Check my update though", "The wife is the hero here, she was nice enough to realize her husband took advantage of you and took your money undeserved. Work on that spine.", "I think these spine comments are uncalled for. I also agree that you don\u2019t do nice things only to get nice things in return. It sucks to find you\u2019ve been taken advantage of in situations where you were nice to someone but it\u2019s also who you are, someone who wants to put good out to the world. Don\u2019t let AHs change that about you.", ">I do have a spine\n\nNo.  You don't.  If you did, you wouldn't be here posting.  Take what happened as a learning experience and work on that spine.", "People will only keep taking advantage of OP if they never stand up for themselves. I wish we could do nice things for people and everything works out every time. But that\u2019s just not real life.", "When I was six, I parked my bike behind my mom\u2019s car. Needless to say I didn\u2019t have a bike anymore and I learned a lesson that day to take care of my stuff. You are not the asshole.", "NTA - would not have given any money to him. Glad the wife gave it back.", "Love your username lol \n\n\n\nNTA", "NTA like you respected what they want you to do not your fault that it was trash day. Also the scooter should be in the trash because if the kid didn\u2019t respect his stuff then they shouldn\u2019t have it", "NTA. \n\nBtw, trash drivers get blamed for this all the time. I was a route manager. People would leave items on top of a dumpster and we\u2019d empty it. They\u2019d call saying the item was not in the dumpster because they wanted it. They\u2019d expect us to replace stuff all the time like that. \n\nYet they complain if he leaves stuff behind. Please don\u2019t be mean to your trash truck drivers.", "I'd start putting cameras up. If someone is leaving stuff on your property, consider it a gift. \n\nNta.", "Sucks being them, leave your stuff where the trash man will take it, its on them, not you. If you move it they get mad, if you don't move it they get mad.", "I personally wish you had disobeyed the man and set the scooter back into their yard anyway or at least moved it away from your trash cans removing the possibility of it being picked up by the garbage collectors but oh, well, as they say, stuff happens.\n\nIt probably is a good lesson to learn and maybe the children from next door will learn to be more careful.  They should also realize that's it's very easy to get your stuff stolen when you leave it out.  One might feel safe when one day to the next they still see their items but then that day comes when they don't...", "oh my god you're so fking nice??? \ud83d\ude2d absolutely NTA!! if the neighbors can't control their kids and the shit they leave on y'alls yard, they shouldn't give their kids things anymore. also, not your fault the scootet ass thrown away. those kids need to learn the value of their items unless they want it to be lost or thrown away. \n\nyou shouldn't have even offered money, but that speaks to your character and how fucking sweet you are. the fact that neighbor called u an ass AND took your money speaks volumes on his character even wayyy before that.", "I feel bad for both OP, and the neighbor\u2019s kids. They aren\u2019t being taught to be conscientious of either their stuff or other people; and that is going to make their lives much harder in many aspects. OP, you are NTA.", "Correct, you do nice things because it makes you feel good", "Yes, you do good things. But if OP never stands up for themselves, they\u2019ll continue to be taken advantage of. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t understand that. You seem like an intelligent person.", "NTA. It was very kind of you to try and pay, although it was absolutely not necessary.\n\nAnd your neighbor, the guy, is double the AH not only giving you crap about what happened, but also for telling you to just leave HIS kids' toys in YOUR yard and he'll pick them up at HIS convenience.", "You are NTA. If somebody leaves something on my property without my permission I hope the trash collectors would pick it up. Gently tell that neighbor that you're not the A but he most certainly is.", "Why the eff did you give them anything???", "This, why would you pay? NTA, but don't get involved with them. You should have left the scooter as is and watched as it was picked up - it wasn't necessary for you to walk over there, even. They leave their stuff out, it gets stolen or trashed, not your problem.", "Lol you\u2019re the only person who is defending my money offering. I don\u2019t need a pat on the back for it, but you\u2019re right that\u2019s my character.", "NTA, but it might be time to tell your landlord or rental company about this. They might have learned a lesson and hopefully won\u2019t repeat it, but one never knows.", "I mean, I said that u shouldn't have even had to have done that but it proves how nice u are like jfc ur neighbors are total a-holes\nedit: save for mom of the household, but the damn dad shows why these kids are like this", "This is a good point. Thanks for the feedback!", "Oof maybe I\u2019m misreading this reply but did I say something wrong. Didn\u2019t mean to offend!", "No, no I'm just aggressively agreeing lmao, sorry for the confusion", "My friend had the same issue with kids down the street leaving their stuff in front of her house in a cul-de-sac. So after a few times of returning items, like scooters, to the house, she started knocking on the door and making sure the adults knew she was returning stuff. It didn't stop. When it got to the point that she had to stop her vehicle and move crap to get into her driveway, she started putting them into her vehicle. When she got a nice haul, she took it all to a shelter for abused women so their kids had something to play with. Funny how that quickly stopped stuff being left blocking her driveway and yard!", "NTA, but now I am curious.  Is mom the bread winner in that family and works all the time so she didn't know her kids leaving toys and stuff in your yard??", "NTA. That\u2019s not even something you have control over", "Nta you should not pay a dollar.", "There's an update. looks like the wife gave the money back : ) and her husband is an ass", "Agreed, OP. That was uncalled for. You do have a spine - just that yours is made of soft rubber."]}
