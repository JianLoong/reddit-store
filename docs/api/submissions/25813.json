The trip would be seven hours so I told my girlfriend and in laws that I paid for an upgrade to business class, they were cool with it.

So we get to the airport and when the first class passengers are called, I looked at my girlfriend and told her \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d. She said they didn\u2019t call our cabin yet, and I told her to look closer at her boarding pass, she looks and is stunned. FIL just laughs and shakes his head, MIL is stunned but doesn\u2019t look happy.\n\nLong story short, we had a ball in first class, she loved it and thanked me again and again. She only said to tell her in advance next time so that she can dress more bougie. We get off the plane and MIL is angry at me. She said how could you leave FIL and her to rot in coach while we live it up in first. To be fair, FIL didn\u2019t really care, he said he slept the whole way. He then told MIL that he\u2019d have left us too if he had the money. MIL said we should all go first together or not at all, that it isn\u2019t really fair or a good look to have two parties be in different classes like that. I said we were originally in business, she said there\u2019s a world of difference between business and first class. She said I could have at least sprung for economy comfort or business class for everyone \u00a0rather than be selfish.\n\nI talked with Diana afterward and she said that while she enjoyed the surprise, she said that maybe I should have saved it for a private trip for the two of us rather than with her parents. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, but I\u2019ve been wrong in the past.

MIL understood the upgrade to Business because of your frame. Further upgrading the tickets to give your girlfriend a treat, but not upgrading your in-laws is a little off. \n\nI agree with your girlfriend. You had a great thought, but it would have been better to save it for a couples trip, rather than widening the difference in treatment between you and the in-laws. \n\nIt\u2019s also not great for your MIL to get so grumpy about it though.\n\nEveryone was just being human. Nothing hugely wrong here to make a drama about. \n\nWhat\u2019s great is that you and your girlfriend seemed to deal with the fallout as a couple really well. That bodes well for the future, as in-law politics is real!", "ESH.... You suck a little more, though.\n\nI mean... Your MIL is right. It's pretty rude and offensive  to bump up yourself and one other person, when you are a group of 4 traveling together, and there is a world of difference between business and first.

A bit nicer, but not much nicer.  I don't think that's worth the upgrade, tbh, unless I have my cat or something with me (or my really tall ex).  It's really only worth it for people like OP, who are legit big people.\n\nThere genuinely is a \"world of difference\" between business and first.

One just has a bit more space for a big guy, which the in-laws didn't need.\n\nBut FIRST CLASS is an experience. They were drinking wine, having fancy food, sleeping on the beds.  It's something one can do as an experience.  OP intentionally lied to his in-laws.   But by lying,  he unintentionally excluded them.  No invite to the first class party. Whether or not they would have upgraded themselves isn't known, but he simply didn't invite them when they planned the vacation.\n\nMIL said it directly - First Class & Business Class ARE  world's apart.

And many flights don\u2019t have the bed option.", "Would you do this to the parents of the person you hope to marry?  I wouldn't do this, full stop.  It comes off as ditching them, excluding them, etc.  Bare minimum, he should've called them and told them he is doing a special surprise for gf and that while he can't afford to also upgrade them, he did want to give them the option to upgrade themselves.  Is that hard?  Instead he lied and said he'd be in economy b/c he's a big guy.  He didn't even think of how this would come off.\n\nOP should apologize for being thoughtless, if he cares about these people's opinions.", "Are you the MIL? Your argument makes absolutely no sense. They were already flying in two different classes. The fact that OP upgraded even higher does not change the experience for MIL & FIL. It is nothing more than jealousy.

We have stayed at the Four Seasons while in laws are at the Doubletree on the same vacation.", "Here is the deal - There is no way that lying to the in-laws and not giving them the option in the first place isn't rude. I have no idea what they are going to do, but the problem isn't that he went to first class. It's that he lied to them and told them they'd be in business.\n\nIf you ditch your travel buddies (which is exactly what he did) that's rude.", "No, but I've worked in tourism for half a decade and have planned the majority of trips for people.\n\nHave you ever been on an airplane before?

It's equivalent, to, say swimming with the dolphins.  \"Hey we're going on a morning hike\" - \"nah, we'll sleep in\" - \"OMG I lied, we actually swam with dolphins\"...\n\nThe general rule of thumb, when traveling with people, is that if you are doing something cool (which flying in first class IS and flying in business is NOT), then you invite them.

I have flown first class and business class internationally at least a dozen times each. On certainly airlines, it can be an experience. But, on most, it isn\u2019t really that much different. And on domestic flights it isn\u2019t really different at all. You sound like you swallowed a brochure.  \n\nAlso, MIL is mad that OP didn\u2019t PAY for everyone.

But\u2026\u2026the US airlines don\u2019t have first (except select international routes on AA). They have business. And flying internationally in first from the US on foreign airlines is many many thousands of dollars to spring for you and your girlfriend, who would have been acknowledged multiples times before boarding for flying internationally in first class. If you\u2019re paying for international first class tickets in cash then you don\u2019t care about buying upgrades for regional flights.", "Sounds like MIL is PB and Jelly.

While I think you're perfectly in the right to fly first-class and shouldn't have to pay for anyone else, I can see where she's coming from too. \n\nWhen you initially talked with them about it, she and FIL agreed to you going in business class and the understanding was the three of them would share economy. Even if she isn't doing anything differently, having plans changed last minute like that can be frustrating, especially if FIL always falls asleep on flights and she was looking forward to having someone to talk to.\n\nI ultimately think this issue is more about the surprise of it all than your seats being first class - though if your girlfriend says you should save those for when it's just the two of you, it's probably best to go with that even if there's nothing technically wrong with leaving them behind.", "Do you know the saying misery loves company? Well, I say, F*** that. Why should you be miserable? NTA", "YTA. I\u2019m going to go against the grain.

That\u2019s like going on a family vacation, but you stay in a five star hotel while your parents stay in Motel 6. Or ordering steak for yourself while getting cup noodles for the in laws. Your girlfriend is right that this would be more appropriate to do if it was just a trip with the two of you, instead of with the in laws. Now your girlfriend can\u2019t even gush about the fun experience without reminding her parents that they were purposely left out.", "The in-laws invited you to join them on vacation, but you ended up in first class.
