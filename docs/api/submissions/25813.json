If it\u2019s a regional flight, I just suck it up, save the cash and sit in economy.\n\nOkay so here\u2019s the story, my in laws invited me and my girlfriend \u201cDiana\u201d on a trip, we paid our own way FYI. The trip would be seven hours so I told my girlfriend and in laws that I paid for an upgrade to business class, they were cool with it.

So we get to the airport and when the first class passengers are called, I looked at my girlfriend and told her \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d.

FIL just laughs and shakes his head, MIL is stunned but doesn\u2019t look happy.\n\nLong story short, we had a ball in first class, she loved it and thanked me again and again. She only said to tell her in advance next time so that she can dress more bougie. We get off the plane and MIL is angry at me. She said how could you leave FIL and her to rot in coach while we live it up in first. To be fair, FIL didn\u2019t really care, he said he slept the whole way. He then told MIL that he\u2019d have left us too if he had the money. MIL said we should all go first together or not at all, that it isn\u2019t really fair or a good look to have two parties be in different classes like that. I said we were originally in business, she said there\u2019s a world of difference between business and first class. She said I could have at least sprung for economy comfort or business class for everyone \u00a0rather than be selfish.\n\nI talked with Diana afterward and she said that while she enjoyed the surprise, she said that maybe I should have saved it for a private trip for the two of us rather than with her parents. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, but I\u2019ve been wrong in the past.

They don\u2019t have a right to be angry.", "NTA.  MIL was being unreasonably selfish.", "NTA - MIL is an entitled AH", "NTA", "Nta", "Slightly ESH. They invited you to spend time with them. MIL understood the upgrade to Business because of your frame. Further upgrading the tickets to give your girlfriend a treat, but not upgrading your in-laws is a little off. \n\nI agree with your girlfriend. You had a great thought, but it would have been better to save it for a couples trip, rather than wisening the difference in treatment between you and the in-laws. \n\nIt\u2019s also not great for your MIL to get so grumpy about it though.\n\nEveryone was just being human. Nothing hugely wrong here to make a drama about. \n\nWhat\u2019s great is that you and your girlfriend seemed to deal with the fallout as a couple really well. That bodes well for the future, as in-law politics is real!", "ESH.... You suck a little more, though.\n\nI mean... Your MIL is right. It's pretty rude and offensive  to bump up yourself and one other person, when you are a group of 4 traveling together, and there is a world of difference between business and first.  (You also lied, and I get that you wanted to surprise your gf... but whew, you also surprised her parents).\n\nShe also could have acted with more grace, but flying makes everyone cranky.\n\nI do think that when you are traveling as a group, you do everything equally and include everyone.  If you had said you were thinking of upgrading to first, and letting them decide if they also wanted to upgrade, they wouldn't have been excluded.", "NTA", "NTA.  But buttering up your MIL could pay huge dividends with your wife.  An upgrade might have been money well spent.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t pay for the first class tickets, you earned it. What MIL might not realise is that flying sucks in general, and even more so when you\u2019re doing it for work. There are so many hours that you never get back from flying for work. This isn\u2019t even accounting for the size factor! \n\nSounds like this is an isolated incident and best to let it wash over and leave it to your FIL and gf to sort out if needed.", "YTA.\n\n\nI agree with your gf.", "Nta", "NTA. MIL has a husband, next time she should ask him.", "NTA- the only people on a flight that notice when others are in different classes are when 1- someone asks to switch from coach and upgrade to be with someone which is rude or 2 when a parent tries to get seats for the smaller kids or pre-teens or even badly behaved teens in coach while parents live it up in 1st class. No one cares otherwise.", "How would it look bad anyway it's not like the whole plane is full of everyone you know, but even if it was, who would care?

You both paid your own way and you told them beforehand you weren't going to be in their \"class\" because you were upgrading your seats.  MIL didn't seem to have a problem with that.  The fact that you upgraded them to first instead of business is of little importance in my opinion.  I tend to agree with girlfriend though that you should have saved the surprise for when you werent with the parents.  Although not an asshole, it is a bit standoffish.", "Hahaha, I only trash first, and will leave anyone else in coach. MIL is just being a bitter biscuit. NTA", "NTA! Your MIL looks bad in green doesn't she. Ha.", "No op already informed everyone he was upgrading his and gf. He just didn\u2019t tell then he upgraded all the way to first class", "How is fair to op to be uncomfortable for that long if flight? He knows how uncomfortable and painful it would be.

Plenty of people have points, etc, that allows them upgrades that everyone can't get.  I could never imagine traveling with a group and being upset that some of them PAID MORE for a nicer seat.", "How is that in any way, shape or form relevant to what I wrote?  \n\nAll he had to do was be honest with the in-laws about his plans, even if he asked them to keep it secret so he could surprise the girlfriend.

However they were all on the same flight and weren\u2019t gonna sit together. There was no difference for the in laws. Mil was just jealous.", "That's a major presumption.\n\nNo one knows if the in-laws would've upgraded themselves, as well.", "They didn\u2019t when op informed them what he was originally gonna upgrade to.", "Yeah, b/c there's not a lot of difference between business and economy.  A bit nicer, but not much nicer.  I don't think that's worth the upgrade, tbh, unless I have my cat or something with me (or my really tall ex).  It's really only worth it for people like OP, who are legit big people.\n\nThere genuinely is a \"world of difference\" between business and first.  First is an experience, and the parents could have also gotten the vacation started early.", "If they want first class they could have booked it. Op and gf paid for their own tickets.

So when we went last summer we decided to book ourselves in first class since we had credit to use. We put our teens in coach. It was fun waving at them when they boarded. They pretended to be annoyed but we enjoyed pointing out that they weren\u2019t paying for anything so their opinions didn\u2019t matter. It was lovely.

So, they were already going to have two different levels of experience. He didn\u2019t ditch them. They were never sitting together.", "Its not starting vacation early.  They were all on the same flight.  They literally landed at the exact same time.", "Right - Business class and economy class are both NOT starting the vacation early. One just has a bit more space for a big guy, which the in-laws didn't need.\n\nBut FIRST CLASS is an experience. They were drinking wine, having fancy food, sleeping on the beds.  It's something one can do as an experience.  OP intentionally lied to his in-laws.   But by lying,  he unintentionally excluded them.  No invite to the first class party. Whether or not they would have upgraded themselves isn't known, but he simply didn't invite them when they planned the vacation.\n\nMIL said it directly - First Class & Business Class ARE  world's apart. (I only upgraded to business class out of need - e.g. I had my cat, my ex was tall - it's not much of a perk for a short person).  \n\nI don't know how you aren't understanding that the lie is the problem, b/c he assumes they would have stayed in economy either way.", "They would have stayed in economy because they couldn\u2019t afford it. Literally what FIL said.

And many flights don\u2019t have the bed option.", "Would you do this to the parents of the person you hope to marry?  I wouldn't do this, full stop.  It comes off as ditching them, excluding them, etc.  Bare minimum, he should've called them and told them he is doing a special surprise for gf and that while he can't afford to also upgrade them, he did want to give them the option to upgrade themselves.  Is that hard?  Instead he lied and said he'd be in economy b/c he's a big guy.  He didn't even think of how this would come off.\n\nOP should apologize for being thoughtless, if he cares about these people's opinions.", "Are you the MIL? Your argument makes absolutely no sense. They were already flying in two different classes. The fact that OP upgraded even higher does not change the experience for MIL & FIL. It is nothing more than jealousy. OP\u2019s actions did not affect their flight experience.", ">b/c there's not a lot of difference between business and economy. A bit nicer, but not much nicer.   \n   \nOn long-haul flights, almost all business class seats are **lie-flat**, and the majority all have direct aisle access.

MIL is the one mad.\n\nSecond, I have left my in-laws in coach while my wife and I are in first class. We have stayed at the Four Seasons while in laws are at the Doubletree on the same vacation.", "Here is the deal - There is no way that lying to the in-laws and not giving them the option in the first place isn't rude. I have no idea what they are going to do, but the problem isn't that he went to first class. It's that he lied to them and told them they'd be in business.\n\nIf you ditch your travel buddies (which is exactly what he did) that's rude.", "No, but I've worked in tourism for half a decade and have planned the majority of trips for people.\n\nHave you ever been on an airplane before?  Flying first class is literally an \"experience\". It's equivalent, to, say swimming with the dolphins.  \"Hey we're going on a morning hike\" - \"nah, we'll sleep in\" - \"OMG I lied, we actually swam with dolphins\"...\n\nThe general rule of thumb, when traveling with people, is that if you are doing something cool (which flying in first class IS and flying in business is NOT), then you invite them.  He straight-up lied to their faces, and (albeit unintentionally) excluded them.", "I dont see it as ditching so agree to disagree", "Lol!! I have flown first class and business class internationally at least a dozen times each. On certainly airlines, it can be an experience. But, on most, it isn\u2019t really that much different. And on domestic flights it isn\u2019t really different at all. You sound like you swallowed a brochure.  \n\nAlso, MIL is mad that OP didn\u2019t PAY for everyone. FIL already admitted that they couldn\u2019t afford it. She is pocket watching and being jealous. That is all."]}
