In fact I was a NCAA Division II Tight End, for non Americans, think of the size of rugby players, for non sports people, I\u2019m a big ass dude. Not to mention my poor knees are shot, and I have a bad lower back. Then factor in that I travel by plane often for work. My job reimburses for flights, but they only pay for a basic seat, any upgrades come out of pocket. Thankfully I make a decent enough living that most of the time I spring for an upgrade to economy comfort or even business class. If I have enough points, or the flight is cheap enough I spring for first class, but only if it\u2019s a longer haul flight. If it\u2019s a regional flight, I just suck it up, save the cash and sit in economy.\n\nOkay so here\u2019s the story, my in laws invited me and my girlfriend \u201cDiana\u201d on a trip, we paid our own way FYI. The trip would be seven hours so I told my girlfriend and in laws that I paid for an upgrade to business class, they were cool with it. But in reality I had something else cooking, Diana has never flown first class and as a special surprise for her I upgraded our seats to first class and would tell her at the airport. \u00a0So for all the reasons I listed above and for Diana I got us upgraded to first. \n\nI was so fucking excited to see her reaction I could barely hold it in. So we get to the airport and when the first class passengers are called, I looked at my girlfriend and told her \u201clet\u2019s go\u201d. She said they didn\u2019t call our cabin yet, and I told her to look closer at her boarding pass, she looks and is stunned. FIL just laughs and shakes his head, MIL is stunned but doesn\u2019t look happy.\n\nLong story short, we had a ball in first class, she loved it and thanked me again and again. She only said to tell her in advance next time so that she can dress more bougie. We get off the plane and MIL is angry at me. She said how could you leave FIL and her to rot in coach while we live it up in first. To be fair, FIL didn\u2019t really care, he said he slept the whole way. He then told MIL that he\u2019d have left us too if he had the money. MIL said we should all go first together or not at all, that it isn\u2019t really fair or a good look to have two parties be in different classes like that. I said we were originally in business, she said there\u2019s a world of difference between business and first class. She said I could have at least sprung for economy comfort or business class for everyone \u00a0rather than be selfish.\n\nI talked with Diana afterward and she said that while she enjoyed the surprise, she said that maybe I should have saved it for a private trip for the two of us rather than with her parents. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal, but I\u2019ve been wrong in the past. So AITA?\n\nP.S: MIL is usually a nice person, I just think that this just set her off.", "created_utc": 1693344480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/164v08e/aita_for_buying_first_class_tickets_and_leaving/", "score": 97, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your MIL sounds bitter & entitled. Also, it\u2019s weird that she claims it \u2018isn\u2019t a good look\u2019 to have separate classes. What?

We didn't whine about it.", "NTA. You paid your own way and have a right to fly any way you want. If it was me, and my friends or family wanted to pay for first class and I couldn\u2019t, I could give a shit less. Have fun, I\u2019ll sit in coach watching movies and sleeping. Your MIL is acting entitled as fuck. She should just be happy for her daughter to have that experience.", "NTA. Your MIL is welcome to upgrade her ticket", "INFO: Was MIL under the impression that everyone had seats together, as in, you all would be spending the flight together? Had she told you her and FIL's seats when she booked her tickets to make sure you got seats in the same row?", "NTA, I feel you on the having to upgrade man, Im a powerlifter with sicatica and I need the extra room when I travel. Sure you could have done it at another time, but why should that matter? You did something for your wife that was really sweet, your MIL is just jealous that she could not have the same experience.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They bought their tickets and you bought your own. She\u2019s just mad that she didn\u2019t get first class. I wouldn\u2019t sweat it. She should just get over herself.", "NTA. MiL is making drama where there should be no drama. You did something nice for her daughter. One would think she'd be happy for her.\n\nTrue Colours and all of that.", "NTA\n\nmothers are often their daughters first and biggest bully.", "NTA- you paid for your own airline tickets. They don\u2019t have a right to be angry.", "NTA.  MIL was being unreasonably selfish.", "NTA - MIL is an entitled AH", "NTA", "Nta", "Slightly ESH. They invited you to spend time with them. MIL understood the upgrade to Business because of your frame. Further upgrading the tickets to give your girlfriend a treat, but not upgrading your in-laws is a little off. \n\nI agree with your girlfriend. You had a great thought, but it would have been better to save it for a couples trip, rather than wisening the difference in treatment between you and the in-laws. \n\nIt\u2019s also not great for your MIL to get so grumpy about it though.\n\nEveryone was just being human. Nothing hugely wrong here to make a drama about. \n\nWhat\u2019s great is that you and your girlfriend seemed to deal with the fallout as a couple really well. That bodes well for the future, as in-law politics is real!", "ESH.... You suck a little more, though.\n\nI mean... Your MIL is right. It's pretty rude and offensive  to bump up yourself and one other person, when you are a group of 4 traveling together, and there is a world of difference between business and first.  (You also lied, and I get that you wanted to surprise your gf... but whew, you also surprised her parents).\n\nShe also could have acted with more grace, but flying makes everyone cranky.\n\nI do think that when you are traveling as a group, you do everything equally and include everyone.  If you had said you were thinking of upgrading to first, and letting them decide if they also wanted to upgrade, they wouldn't have been excluded.", "NTA", "NTA.  But buttering up your MIL could pay huge dividends with your wife.  An upgrade might have been money well spent.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t pay for the first class tickets, you earned it. What MIL might not realise is that flying sucks in general, and even more so when you\u2019re doing it for work. There are so many hours that you never get back from flying for work. This isn\u2019t even accounting for the size factor! \n\nSounds like this is an isolated incident and best to let it wash over and leave it to your FIL and gf to sort out if needed.", "YTA.\n\n\nI agree with your gf.", "Nta", "NTA. MIL has a husband, next time she should ask him.", "NTA- the only people on a flight that notice when others are in different classes are when 1- someone asks to switch from coach and upgrade to be with someone which is rude or 2 when a parent tries to get seats for the smaller kids or pre-teens or even badly behaved teens in coach while parents live it up in 1st class. No one cares otherwise.", "How would it look bad anyway it's not like the whole plane is full of everyone you know, but even if it was, who would care? Nta", "NTA. \n\nIf she was ok with you upgrading to business, this isn't that different in the sense that you still wouldn't have been together. \n\nAnd saying she was going to \"rot\"?  Come on.  Let's assume she was miserable. She was fine with being miserable as long as you were more miserable, since you are bigger?  That is just a shitty way to be.", "NTA", "NTA.  You both paid your own way and you told them beforehand you weren't going to be in their \"class\" because you were upgrading your seats.  MIL didn't seem to have a problem with that.  The fact that you upgraded them to first instead of business is of little importance in my opinion.  I tend to agree with girlfriend though that you should have saved the surprise for when you werent with the parents.  Although not an asshole, it is a bit standoffish.", "Hahaha, I only trash first, and will leave anyone else in coach. MIL is just being a bitter biscuit. NTA", "NTA! Your MIL looks bad in green doesn't she. Ha.", "No op already informed everyone he was upgrading his and gf. He just didn\u2019t tell then he upgraded all the way to first class", "How is fair to op to be uncomfortable for that long if flight? He knows how uncomfortable and painful it would be. If the in law decided to upgrade so it would be comfortable but didn\u2019t upgrade op and gf would they be ah?", "especially since they invited OP on the trip.", "I mean, no.  Plenty of people have points, etc, that allows them upgrades that everyone can't get.  I could never imagine traveling with a group and being upset that some of them PAID MORE for a nicer seat.", "How is that in any way, shape or form relevant to what I wrote?  \n\nAll he had to do was be honest with the in-laws about his plans, even if he asked them to keep it secret so he could surprise the girlfriend.  He didn't owe them an upgrade, but he also ditched them.", "It cant be a ditch when they weren\u2019t gonna be sitting together. If he change what flight he and gf were taking then yes inform them. However they were all on the same flight and weren\u2019t gonna sit together. There was no difference for the in laws. Mil was just jealous.", "That's a major presumption.\n\nNo one knows if the in-laws would've upgraded themselves, as well.", "They didn\u2019t when op informed them what he was originally gonna upgrade to.", "Yeah, b/c there's not a lot of difference between business and economy.  A bit nicer, but not much nicer.  I don't think that's worth the upgrade, tbh, unless I have my cat or something with me (or my really tall ex).  It's really only worth it for people like OP, who are legit big people.\n\nThere genuinely is a \"world of difference\" between business and first.  First is an experience, and the parents could have also gotten the vacation started early.", "If they want first class they could have booked it. Op and gf paid for their own tickets. Do you think they are gonna upgrade their tickets for the way home now they know op and gf will be in first class?"]}
