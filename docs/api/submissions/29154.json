I'd recommend either you stop asking, ask WAY sooner than necessary, or you just get them food every time.", "NTA \n\nId just stop asking and bring them food regardless", "NTA, unless 20 minutes was an exaggeration, it is quite rude to make someone wait when you are trying to help them.", "NTA and frankly, I'd stop asking.", "NTA, play stupid games win stupid prices. That said you wont change them. my tip - start to bring them food every time and eat it yourself if they dont want it.", "I don't \"take orders\" anymore for family. If I'm grabbing food for myself while out, I just buy extra random stuff and let them fight over it at home. \n\nNAH. Getting aggravated with them probably makes you feel like an asshole, so just skip the phone calls and bring food anyway.", "NTA, but the problem is YOUR WIFE.\n\nWhy the heck does she have to call them every. time. you go out??? Especially when it is such a frustrating ordeal to ask them?\n\nYou and your wife need to have a talk.\n\n* Again, the big question: WHY? (maybe it's because they don't have money to eat out; maybe they don't get out of the house easily; maybe wife was just trained to keep trying to please them (and keep trying because it never works); some reason I can't imagine...\n* So, how does she achieve her goal without putting the both of you through that particular torture?\n\n1. If they don't have money, then give them gift cards to restaurants they like.\n2. If they don't get out, then give them gift cards to a dinner delivery service.\n3. If your wife just wants to please them, then she can (get counseling if she can't adjust on her own)... (1) learn that she doesn't have to do this every. time. you go out - maybe once out of 5 times. (2) ask her grandparents for their orders well before you even leave the house and tell them that you won't be answering your phone during dinner. (3) only order from restaurants that they know well and like to eat that food. (4) Figure out why she needs to please her grandparents so very much\n\nYou get the idea. Figure out what your wife's goal is. Figure out a way to achieve her goal (or tone it down) without putting yourselves through torture. Good luck.", "I don\u2019t like head games. \n\nIf I were you, I\u2019d either (1) not offer anymore, or (2) send a text along the lines of \u201cWe\u2019re going to [restaurant]. If you want something you can tell us by X:00 PM and we\u2019ll bring it to you.\u201d", "NTA, but if they\u2019re always like this, your wife needs to stop asking them.  When you know doing something regularly nets you an unpleasant result, you should stop doing it.", "NTA. That would drive me nuts. I'd either stop offering altogether or just buy whatever items I know they like and eat them myself if they didn't want them. \n\nDo you live with your wife's grandparents, or is this just a way to keep in contact with them? Are they maybe dragging out the calls because they're lonely?", "NTA\n\nJust stop asking them.

It\u2019s fine to be annoyed, but why ascribe malice and manipulation to them? \nYou don\u2019t really know their motives, you only know their actions.  They could just be indecisive.
