He was always the one who took care of me, made sure I was safe, fed, and happy. \n\nMy mom left us when I was 3 years old to escape my narcissistic abusive pathetic excuse of a father (Lev's Stepdad). Then, 6 years later, my dad finally drinks and smokes enough to die of a stroke. \n\nLev fights for custody of me, wins, and we move into a small apartment together. (At this point he's 18 and I'm 10). And Lev continues taking good care of me until things go to shit, he starts drinking, loses his job, some bad things happen and I get taken away and put into a home. \nLev and I stay in contact until I'm 14, when I find out that he's been in contact with our mom ever since she left, and nobody wanted to tell me because I was \"too young to understand\". I'm furious and cut contact with him. Both he and my mom try to contact me several times but I refused to talk to them.\n\nI decided to contact him again when I was 19, and we've been fixing our relationship ever since. He's stopped drinking, has a lovely wife and a baby on the way. I've been talking to my mom as well and we're also in the process of fixing our relationship with a lot of therapy. \n\nI'm deeply grateful for everything Lev has done for me. I know how much he had on his shoulders back then, being so young himself and trying to raise me. Despite everything, he's truly my best friend. On the other side, I can't deny how much everything that happened fucked me up. I'm still healing deep scars from my traumatic childhood.\n\nThe other day, Lev and I were talking on Skype about my dad and a couple other things that happened. He basically says \"That asshole really ruined both our lives completely, everything was his fault\". I wanted to agree with him, but, like I said, I feel that some things were his fault as well. \nI must have had a weird look on my face, because he asks \"what?\". And I tell him \"Well, dad really was an ass and he did some awful things, but some of the stuff you did really fucked up my childhood too\". \n\nHis face goes blank and he stops talking. After a few seconds he says \"I tried my best, you know? It wasn't easy for me either.\" I tell him quickly that I know that, and I'll never forget everything he did for me. He says \"but you still think I fucked up your childhood?\" And before I can answer he hangs up the call. He hasn't answered any of my messages or calls. \n\nI don't know if what I said was over the line, but I feel like I need to speak my truth as well....\nAm I the asshole?\n\nEdit because so many people raise this Point:\nI blame my parents way, way, WAY more than ANYONE else in this situation. \nAlso, this truly wasn't about blaming anyone. It was simply a comment I intended to make in a conversation. A stupid, insensitive and unnecessary comment. And not one made to blame my brother for what happened.\n\nEdit 2: I just want to say thank you to you people who took the time to comment your constructive thoughts and criticisms. I wasn't expecting this much thoughtfulness or insight, and I appreciate the perspective most of you have had to offer. I'm really touched. \n\nA lot of people mentioned therapy. All of us, Lev, my mom and I are in therapy. We have separate therapists but Lev and I go to the same office. I have a session once a month with Lev, and a session once every three months with my mom. He has the same.\n\nI called Lev an hour ago, and now I'm at his place. I apologized to him, told him I know how much he sacrificed for me to have a better life, and that I see his pain and how much he struggled.\nHe told me he understands my feelings too. He understands what he put me through. That I came into contact with a lot of things that no child should ever have to see because of certain choices. He intends to work on himself, for the sake of our relationship and for his child. He obviously doesn't want history to repeat itself. \n\nI'm thinking of planning a surprise weekend trip with him to a mountain range close to where we live. We used to go rock climbing there and it's a happy place for both of us. I want to have a good time with him there, and maybe take the time to talk about a few things. Mostly I just want to show him how sorry I am and how much I appreciate him.\n\nThanks again to those who commented. You are lovely, intelligent people and you really helped me a lot.", "created_utc": 1671119177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmo9z2/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_messed_up_my/", "score": 509, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was venting about your dad, and your response was \"well you're not any better,\" as you're actively trying to fix your relationship.", "Once while hiking along a torrential river we came across a small bronze memorial plaque- a local with us explained that years back a small boy had fallen into the river at that point. A man who happened to be nearby heard the boy scream and jumped into the river in an attempt to save the child. He failed- both the man and boy were swept under and drowned. \n\nI bring this up because there are two things in the above to consider: 1) the tragic outcome makes the man no less a hero for his actions and 2) the man bears no responsibility for the tragic outcome.\n\nYour brother was in a similar situation. He tried to save you, but the circumstances around both of your childhoods made it an impossible task. In the end you both suffered the consequences of your parent's failures. It sounds like the adults in your situation abdicated their responsibility and your brother tried to take on more than he could handle- for your benefit I might add.\n\nThis doesn't negate the very real feelings you have about what happened to you, nor should it. But from your post it sounds very much like your brother did his best before being dragged under by the emotional toll your parents actions took on both of you. Not many 18 year olds would even have made the attempt.\n\nGive him some time, and work on reconciliation.", "Soft YTA. Faulting your brother is like blaming someone who finds you bleeding on the road and does the best they can,  but they aren't a doctor, they didn't sign up for this, so maybe they accidently break a rib giving you CPR or do some other damage while they try to save your life. Your brother was wholly unqualified, but he didn't just cut out of there when he turned 18. He did his best to save you.", "There is speaking the truth, and then there is speaking the truth with consideration/love/diplomacy.\n\nYou did the former and didn't quite do the latter, maybe because it was a  casual conversation.\n\nSo he tried his best, but yes, he couldn't carry it through all the way evidenced by your being put in a home.   And that's tough for you.  And he probably knows that and already feels kinda guilty about it, possibly defensive too.  But again, nobody was offering him help at that young age so maybe he feels he got dealt a bad hand just like you did, and alcoholism was modeled by your stepdad.\n\nMaybe you should try counseling to work through the issues and figure out how to say things to family members that validates your experience and yet is diplomatic.", "I'm not certain how to judge this.  I feel like you've got a right to be able to be open about the things that have happened to you and how you feel about them.  But I also feel like I understand what a freaking gut punch that had to be to Levi.  He was a person who tried to do the right thing during a very messed up time in both of your lives.  \n\nI think a judgement depends on how you handle this next.", "Although this is a case where I would put yourself in his position too. The mans 18, just out of school his needing to care for you likely damaged whatever future prospects of college or other future plans he would have. It sounds like alcoholism may have a genetic tendency to run among the family, t. I'm sure that he tried his best to care for you and protect you as well as he could.\n\nAlthough this is a case where I would put yourself in his position too. The man is 18, just out of school his needing to care for you likely damaged whatever future prospects of college or other future plans he would have. It sounds like alcoholism may have a genetic tendency to run among the family, and your brother didn't have a mother figure during his teenage years (which I would argue are the most important) to counteract what he experienced and learned from your father. It doesn't surprise me that he eventually fell into a slightly similar hole as your father, being 18 with precious little life experiences, giving up their future to care for you, and likely experiencing massive amounts of stress as a result. People break under less.\n\nShould be be able to recognize his involvement in your own trauma? Probably. But a lot of this is also the result of such heavy burdens being thrust on someone who is not remotely close to ready to take it on yet, and for that I wouldn't blame your brother. If anyone, your father is the biggest asshole here, and I wouldn't hate your brother too much for what happened, unless there;s some other damning context that is left out here.\n\nAsk yourself what you would realistically do in his situation, with such stress, with no role model, with a genetic predisposition to addiction.For most people, the answer is \"not much better.\" And, when most people try to say otherwise or argue with their own bias, they're underestimating how terrible a situation this actually is, or are just lying to themselves.", "You guys need to go to therapy.. I am sure he resents having to take care of you at such a young age. And his inadequate attempt is filled with shame and now hurt from you.", "**Gently, YTA.**\n\nHe was a traumatised child raising a traumatised child, on top of which he didn't have any good role models of his own from whom to learn how to be a good parent. He was learning as he went, at a time when HE needed parents and support and love . . . and he wasn't even dealing with a very young child, a somewhat blank slate; instead he was trying to raise a kid who was already old enough to have been badly traumatised by your parents' behaviour, with no support or guidance to help him navigate that. You say that you understand the burden that he carried, but if you're still assigning blame to him then I'm not sure that you really DO comprehend it. \n\nLook, my situation is not the same as yours, but there are parallels. I was badly and repeatedly traumatised as a child, and my parents - like your brother, through no fault of their own but because they were basically \"flying blind\" with no guidance - made a LOT of mistakes that really damaged me further. And I'm not talking about little mistakes, I mean that a psychiatrist who specialised in dealing with troubled teens once told me that I was the only patient he'd had who had ACCURATELY assessed my own parents as being really problematic (most teenagers think their parents are awful . . . I was correct about mine). But as an adult I understand that they didn't \"mess up my life\". I mean, they did, but not in a way that it would be fair to accuse them of or blame them for. They did the best they could with the information and tools that they had. They loved me, and they struggled, and I have forgiven them because they genuinely didn't know better. \n\nYou may not be INCORRECT that your brother caused harm and messed you up in his own ways . . . but you're an AH for shaming him for it, knowing that he was doing the best he could, with the tools he had, as a traumatised teenager trying to raise a kid. What you said to him was unfair and unkind. I think that you probably still need some therapy. But in the meantime, gently, YTA.", "Soft YTA\n\nI dont really want to call you TA cause this is a difficult situation. However, I do think the way that you went about this specific situation made you TA. Did he make mistakes that ultimately affected you? Yes. But at the same time, im sure there were flipped situations during the time of him taking care of you that really affected him and his development. You both were struggling at the same time, mostly due to  your parents not him. In this specific situation, he was talking with you about shared trauma that you've experienced. I'm guessing he was searching for validation or just comfort from you. Instead, your response was to call him out on mistakes that he made as a freshly turned adult who tried and failed at taking care of their sibling. I'm not saying that you can't be upset about the bad things that happened in your life. All I'm saying it that you were both dealt a shitty hand, and he's the one person who can probably understand what you went through the best. I think he deserves a little forgiveness.", "YTA sweetheart, but soft YTA. Think about how badly YOU fucked up HIS childhood. Talk about parentification. He had to learn all the legalese to keep you from going into The System. And then he had to parent you. Wow. Props to him, man. \n\nYou need to apologize to him. Yah, let him know he fucked up your childhood in the same way that all well-meaning young parents fuck up their kids' childhoods, BUT he kept you with family instead of with foster care.", "NAH\n\nYeah Lev did mess up and I know his decisions impacted you so you weren\u2019t lying but at the same time it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Lev was a deeply mess up kid that was attempting to be a parent. I don\u2019t really see a scenario where he could be an amazing and stable parental figure to you considering everything he was dealing with at the time. \n\nI think the way it was brought up was maybe a little harsh and I can understand why this would be super hurtful to him. In his eyes I\u2019m sure he was doing his best and he really did sacrifice his childhood in a lot of ways if he had to bring you up. I think from his perspective what you said was kind of like putting him in the same category as your parents who sound like horrible people.", "NAH. This really is a situation where i think neither of you are really at fault. Your brothers childhood was messed up too and with that was the additional responsibility of taking care of another human being while being pretty much a child himself and hadn't had the opportunity yet to recognise or heal himself. That couldnt have been easy at all. \n\nI don't think you are at fault for saying what you feel, but I definitely think you should have been gentler about it.", "YTA. I'm not trying to be mean but you do realize that you fucked up his life too? That there were a lot of things he missed out on and things he was way too young to handle. Does he blame you for messing up his childhood? From the sound of your post he doesn't which makes your comment even more petty. Do you understand what he sacrificed to be able to take care of you those first few years? Do better because your brother deserves it.", "YTA: He was a victim too and tried his best to help you and shield you from all the crap that was going on around you. He couldn't stop all of it. All of the terrible things that happened to you were because of your parents.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to tell him how you truly feel. What he did then was not good and fucked up your childhood. \n\nBut he was barely a child himself. What he managed to do was totally amazing. With a childhood like this it's no wonder his life had some downs, too. He worked on it and managed to move on from that. Again, an amazing feat.\n\nI think both of you know that he fucked up back then. But was it solely his fault? Didn't his own childhood trauma cause this? It wasn't very nice of you to point it out like that. It seems unthankful and insensitive.", "YTA he was a kid when all this kicked off yet he tried his best and fought for you too. If you want to blame anyone blame your mom", "Agree. Soft YTA. Your 18 year old brother thought for you. He had no idea what he was doing but didn't abandon you. If he did he'd have been in a better place now.  You're mad at the wrong person.", "YTA...your brother was 18 and went through his own shit. He tried his best", "NAH. You both need therapy if you aren\u2019t in it. You can see the good he tried to do and clearly separate it from the bad that happened.  That\u2019s a good thing. He may not be at that point yet. I\u2019m sure it hurt him to realize that some of his problems affected you, but they did. His problems may stem from stepdad though so he likely hasn\u2019t put together that there is a line of struggles that continued to affect you", "I'm not going to give a  judgment because this is definitely above my pay grade. I just want to point out that Lev isn't wrong: everything IS your dad (and your mom's) fault. Even the \"wrong\" things Lev did or didn't do were your dad's fault because Lev never should have had to make the choices or do the things he had to do. \n\nEvery trauma in your life, and every trauma in Lev's life is directly caused by your father. \n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole, but I want you to think about everything Lev went through and have up to try to protect you and give you a better life than he had, and learning that you feel he somehow harmed you was unquestionably a kick in his gut and probably made him feel guilty when he is actually as much a victim, if not an even bigger victim, to your father's abuse than you are. Honestly, if I were  him, I would stop talking to you, too, because knowing you feel that way only adds to his own trauma.\n\nETA... I want to clarify that I think you have a right to express your feelings, but we need to be careful in our phrasing because your phrasing was dismissive of your father's wrongdoing... \"yeah dad did bad things but\" the \"but\" dismisses or diminishes your father's abuse while focusing on you feeling harmed by Lev, so it would have been a lot better if you had talked through with a therapist HOW to express your feelings in a healthy, non-harmful, way.", "Yeah, I'm going to agree with the Soft YTA for the comment itself.  But I saw you said you plan on apologizing and trying to make it up to him which is great and absolutely the right thing to do.  Everyone screws up sometimes and says things that come out too harsh or hurtful.  Important thing is recognizing that and making it right :)", "Nah. You were both wounded and failed by your parents. Both of you. He took on a burden he couldn\u2019t handle and that was very consequential on you when he failed. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a blame game here, you need continued family counseling where you can talk openly about this to heal the wounds you obviously still have. Forgiveness is something earned and learned, hopefully you will both get there.", "NTA, no. You can be grateful for stuff someone did for you and still be aware they fucked up your childhood. Him not understanding that is a *him* problem. \n\nYou take care of yourself OP, i'm glad your life starts to get better, from what i've understood.", "I would say NTA, but also remember that that must have hurt Lev. He might need time to process it", "[deleted]", "NTA: Just because they were trying their best doesn't mean that what they did was right.\n\nYou are allowed your truth, and what happened back then doesn't have to change the forward motion you and your family are taking now.  \n\nThat's something your brother will have to learn to cope with. Some of his actions caused another person harm. He'll have to accept that part of himself, learn from it, and heal from it.\n\nThat's the point of communication in healthy relationships. Putting it out there that something went wrong, and all parties learning how to navigate around it in healthy ways to reach a conclusion of strength, love, and acceptance. \n\nYour brother may need some time, but I think the two of you can work through this. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, it\u2019s great that he is doing better now but part of the recovery process is recognizing mistakes and making amends.

He was an 18 year old who was suddenly thrust into the role of taking care of a 10 yr old. The world imploded on him, and he lost custody of you. That experience was horrible for you, but it was also horrible for him. \u201cWe were both burned by our parents, and it impacted our ability to function normally, but we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d See how that wording acknowledges that he wasn\u2019t perfect, but that you recognize that it wasn\u2019t exactly his fault that he didn\u2019t KNOW what to do to keep you safe, or how to function as an adult when the only role models he had were garbage?

She had Lev when she was 17 and me when she was 25, so she'd spent most of her life being married to abusive men and raising kids (Lev's father wasn't much better than mine).\n\nSo she kind of just...left. To go live her life and not be miserable I guess. She made sure to stay in contact with Lev, because she says we were still important to her, but I was \"too young\" to understand (I mean, I was when I was 3).

HE wants to blame your deceased dad entirely, and apparently exonerates your mother of all blame. You understandably resent him saying it was all YOUR dad's fault, but instead of distributing the blame to both parents before discussing his responsibility, you lash straight back at him without mentioning mom as a factor either.

This is such a kick in the face to people who have suffered abuse and ones who managed to get their shit together for the people who they chose to take care of.", "So because his parents fucked up, he shouldn\u2019t be blamed for abandoning her for days, starving her, or exposing her to potentially dangerous strangers?", "I think you are making assumptions about a situation which you can't understand. I would never want to intentionally hurt or punish my brother. The fact that I did makes me the asshole, no question. But all you armchair psychologists who feel like they know mine and Lev's whole life from one post? Yeah, you need to step down from the pedestal you've put yourself onto.", "But what her brother did does liken him to her father\u2026", "I agree with you one hundred percent. \n\nWe have had therapy sessions where he has apologized for specific things that happened.\n\nI know that he made his choices, not to hurt me (obviously) but because he didn't know any better. Ultimately, all of it boils down to the abuse from our father and the neglect from our mother.\n\nI don't resent him for what happened. And what I said to him during the Skype call was just plain insensitive. \n\nI'm so grateful to have him in my life and am ready to work through all of my issues so we can have the best relationship we can. \nI know he feels the same about us, plus his wife and his child.\n\nAll I want is for people to not make this a black and white thing, or make assumptions about what kind of person I am based on one reddit post.", "Why do you guys keep using the traumatized child reason? There are so many traumatized people in this world, they don\u2019t fucking starve their children/siblings because of it. No one said he was the root of her suffering, but he played a part in it.", "And I never said that that was right or that he was perfect. He was an abusef teenager who lost the formative for learning how to live independently and gave up more time to try do the best for her. What she said is not actually discussing what went wrong it's just saying he's the same as his dad who literally abused him and when I said resentment I don't mean before this I mean his reaction to her saying that. There was nothing productive in this conversation", "Lmao, did you not come on here asking people to judge you?  \n\nThe fact that you left out your father\u2019s treatment of your brother, and don\u2019t seem to consider his experiences as important is also something that should be considered when judging you (specifically what this forum is for). It does say a lot about how little consideration you are expending outside your bubble. \n\nAgain this doesn\u2019t invalidate your experience or justify your parents actions on any way, they are horrible. Though it does show just how little thought you have dedicated to your brothers experience and life.", "But wouldn\u2019t your logic also make OP part of the brothers suffering and without the \u201ctraumatized child reason\u201d she would look pretty much like she was lashing out like .. an AH.", "She never got the chance to explain because he ended the call like a child. NOWHERE in her conversation with him does she say he\u2019s the same as his dad. All she said is that that he fucked up aswell. That is not saying her brother and dad are the same, that is saying that he contributed to her trauma. He does not get to resent her now because she\u2019s pointing out the truth. He fed his drug habit instead of her. There was nothing productive in the conversation because he ran as soon as he had to take responsibility for his own actions.", "Lmao! Because I didn't put it in a reddit post? Alright then.", "She said \"dad was an ass and did some shitty but you fucked up my childhood too\" which puts an immediate connotation that the two were similar and tbh ass and shitty are far more Positive adjectives than fucked up. For a conversation like this to happen and be productive it can't be sprung on her and unfortunately there is absolutely nothing to stop him being resentful. There is no way for her to force him to face that. So if she wanted him to discuss this with her and also maintain a relationship she should have played ball because being blunt will not always work.", "Perhaps you came to the wrong forum?  If you were just looking for pats in the back and commiseration another forum would probably be a better bet?\n\nSo just to recap here, you told your brother just about the worst thing possible to tear him down, but question if your YTA. Not sure it should take a lot of introspection to conclude that what you did wasn\u2019t just wrong, but straight up disgusting.", "Good God, you're not even _trying_ to understand. Whatever. There's no arguing with stupid. Thanks for your insight. Have a good life."]}
