He was always the one who took care of me, made sure I was safe, fed, and happy. \n\nMy mom left us when I was 3 years old to escape my narcissistic abusive pathetic excuse of a father (Lev's Stepdad). Then, 6 years later, my dad finally drinks and smokes enough to die of a stroke. \n\nLev fights for custody of me, wins, and we move into a small apartment together. (At this point he's 18 and I'm 10). And Lev continues taking good care of me until things go to shit, he starts drinking, loses his job, some bad things happen and I get taken away and put into a home. \nLev and I stay in contact until I'm 14, when I find out that he's been in contact with our mom ever since she left, and nobody wanted to tell me because I was \"too young to understand\". I'm furious and cut contact with him. Both he and my mom try to contact me several times but I refused to talk to them.\n\nI decided to contact him again when I was 19, and we've been fixing our relationship ever since. He's stopped drinking, has a lovely wife and a baby on the way. I've been talking to my mom as well and we're also in the process of fixing our relationship with a lot of therapy. \n\nI'm deeply grateful for everything Lev has done for me. I know how much he had on his shoulders back then, being so young himself and trying to raise me. Despite everything, he's truly my best friend. On the other side, I can't deny how much everything that happened fucked me up. I'm still healing deep scars from my traumatic childhood.\n\nThe other day, Lev and I were talking on Skype about my dad and a couple other things that happened. He basically says \"That asshole really ruined both our lives completely, everything was his fault\". I wanted to agree with him, but, like I said, I feel that some things were his fault as well. \nI must have had a weird look on my face, because he asks \"what?\". And I tell him \"Well, dad really was an ass and he did some awful things, but some of the stuff you did really fucked up my childhood too\". \n\nHis face goes blank and he stops talking. After a few seconds he says \"I tried my best, you know? It wasn't easy for me either.\" I tell him quickly that I know that, and I'll never forget everything he did for me. He says \"but you still think I fucked up your childhood?\" And before I can answer he hangs up the call. He hasn't answered any of my messages or calls. \n\nI don't know if what I said was over the line, but I feel like I need to speak my truth as well....\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1671119177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmo9z2/aita_for_telling_my_brother_he_messed_up_my/", "score": 147, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was venting about your dad, and your response was \"well you're not any better,\" as you're actively trying to fix your relationship.", "Once while hiking along a torrential river we came across a small bronze memorial plaque- a local with us explained that years back a small boy had fallen into the river at that point. A man who happened to be nearby heard the boy scream and jumped into the river in an attempt to save the child. He failed- both the man and boy were swept under and drowned. \n\nI bring this up because there are two things in the above to consider: 1) the tragic outcome makes the man no less a hero for his actions and 2) the man bears no responsibility for the tragic outcome.\n\nYour brother was in a similar situation. He tried to save you, but the circumstances around both of your childhoods made it an impossible task. In the end you both suffered the consequences of your parent's failures. It sounds like the adults in your situation abdicated their responsibility and your brother tried to take on more than he could handle- for your benefit I might add.\n\nThis doesn't negate the very real feelings you have about what happened to you, nor should it. But from your post it sounds very much like your brother did his best before being dragged under by the emotional toll your parents actions took on both of you. Not many 18 year olds would even have made the attempt.\n\nGive him some time, and work on reconciliation.", "Soft YTA. Faulting your brother is like blaming someone who finds you bleeding on the road and does the best they can,  but they aren't a doctor, they didn't sign up for this, so maybe they accidently break a rib giving you CPR or do some other damage while they try to save your life. Your brother was wholly unqualified, but he didn't just cut out of there when he turned 18. He did his best to save you.", "There is speaking the truth, and then there is speaking the truth with consideration/love/diplomacy.\n\nYou did the former and didn't quite do the latter, maybe because it was a  casual conversation.\n\nSo he tried his best, but yes, he couldn't carry it through all the way evidenced by your being put in a home.   And that's tough for you.  And he probably knows that and already feels kinda guilty about it, possibly defensive too.  But again, nobody was offering him help at that young age so maybe he feels he got dealt a bad hand just like you did, and alcoholism was modeled by your stepdad.\n\nMaybe you should try counseling to work through the issues and figure out how to say things to family members that validates your experience and yet is diplomatic.", "I'm not certain how to judge this.  I feel like you've got a right to be able to be open about the things that have happened to you and how you feel about them.  But I also feel like I understand what a freaking gut punch that had to be to Levi.  He was a person who tried to do the right thing during a very messed up time in both of your lives.  \n\nI think a judgement depends on how you handle this next.", "Although this is a case where I would put yourself in his position too. The mans 18, just out of school his needing to care for you likely damaged whatever future prospects of college or other future plans he would have. It sounds like alcoholism may have a genetic tendency to run among the family, t. I'm sure that he tried his best to care for you and protect you as well as he could.\n\nAlthough this is a case where I would put yourself in his position too. The man is 18, just out of school his needing to care for you likely damaged whatever future prospects of college or other future plans he would have. It sounds like alcoholism may have a genetic tendency to run among the family, and your brother didn't have a mother figure during his teenage years (which I would argue are the most important) to counteract what he experienced and learned from your father. It doesn't surprise me that he eventually fell into a slightly similar hole as your father, being 18 with precious little life experiences, giving up their future to care for you, and likely experiencing massive amounts of stress as a result. People break under less.\n\nShould be be able to recognize his involvement in your own trauma? Probably. But a lot of this is also the result of such heavy burdens being thrust on someone who is not remotely close to ready to take it on yet, and for that I wouldn't blame your brother. If anyone, your father is the biggest asshole here, and I wouldn't hate your brother too much for what happened, unless there;s some other damning context that is left out here.\n\nAsk yourself what you would realistically do in his situation, with such stress, with no role model, with a genetic predisposition to addiction.For most people, the answer is \"not much better.\" And, when most people try to say otherwise or argue with their own bias, they're underestimating how terrible a situation this actually is, or are just lying to themselves.", "You guys need to go to therapy.. I am sure he resents having to take care of you at such a young age. And his inadequate attempt is filled with shame and now hurt from you.", "**Gently, YTA.**\n\nHe was a traumatised child raising a traumatised child, on top of which he didn't have any good role models of his own from whom to learn how to be a good parent. He was learning as he went, at a time when HE needed parents and support and love . . . and he wasn't even dealing with a very young child, a somewhat blank slate; instead he was trying to raise a kid who was already old enough to have been badly traumatised by your parents' behaviour, with no support or guidance to help him navigate that. You say that you understand the burden that he carried, but if you're still assigning blame to him then I'm not sure that you really DO comprehend it. \n\nLook, my situation is not the same as yours, but there are parallels. I was badly and repeatedly traumatised as a child, and my parents - like your brother, through no fault of their own but because they were basically \"flying blind\" with no guidance - made a LOT of mistakes that really damaged me further. And I'm not talking about little mistakes, I mean that a psychiatrist who specialised in dealing with troubled teens once told me that I was the only patient he'd had who had ACCURATELY assessed my own parents as being really problematic (most teenagers think their parents are awful . . . I was correct about mine). But as an adult I understand that they didn't \"mess up my life\". I mean, they did, but not in a way that it would be fair to accuse them of or blame them for. They did the best they could with the information and tools that they had. They loved me, and they struggled, and I have forgiven them because they genuinely didn't know better. \n\nYou may not be INCORRECT that your brother caused harm and messed you up in his own ways . . . but you're an AH for shaming him for it, knowing that he was doing the best he could, with the tools he had, as a traumatised teenager trying to raise a kid. What you said to him was unfair and unkind. I think that you probably still need some therapy. But in the meantime, gently, YTA.", "Soft YTA\n\nI dont really want to call you TA cause this is a difficult situation. However, I do think the way that you went about this specific situation made you TA. Did he make mistakes that ultimately affected you? Yes. But at the same time, im sure there were flipped situations during the time of him taking care of you that really affected him and his development. You both were struggling at the same time, mostly due to  your parents not him. In this specific situation, he was talking with you about shared trauma that you've experienced. I'm guessing he was searching for validation or just comfort from you. Instead, your response was to call him out on mistakes that he made as a freshly turned adult who tried and failed at taking care of their sibling. I'm not saying that you can't be upset about the bad things that happened in your life. All I'm saying it that you were both dealt a shitty hand, and he's the one person who can probably understand what you went through the best. I think he deserves a little forgiveness.", "YTA sweetheart, but soft YTA. Think about how badly YOU fucked up HIS childhood. Talk about parentification. He had to learn all the legalese to keep you from going into The System. And then he had to parent you. Wow. Props to him, man. \n\nYou need to apologize to him. Yah, let him know he fucked up your childhood in the same way that all well-meaning young parents fuck up their kids' childhoods, BUT he kept you with family instead of with foster care.", "NAH\n\nYeah Lev did mess up and I know his decisions impacted you so you weren\u2019t lying but at the same time it\u2019s worth acknowledging that Lev was a deeply mess up kid that was attempting to be a parent. I don\u2019t really see a scenario where he could be an amazing and stable parental figure to you considering everything he was dealing with at the time. \n\nI think the way it was brought up was maybe a little harsh and I can understand why this would be super hurtful to him. In his eyes I\u2019m sure he was doing his best and he really did sacrifice his childhood in a lot of ways if he had to bring you up. I think from his perspective what you said was kind of like putting him in the same category as your parents who sound like horrible people.", "NAH. This really is a situation where i think neither of you are really at fault. Your brothers childhood was messed up too and with that was the additional responsibility of taking care of another human being while being pretty much a child himself and hadn't had the opportunity yet to recognise or heal himself. That couldnt have been easy at all. \n\nI don't think you are at fault for saying what you feel, but I definitely think you should have been gentler about it.", "YTA. I'm not trying to be mean but you do realize that you fucked up his life too? That there were a lot of things he missed out on and things he was way too young to handle. Does he blame you for messing up his childhood? From the sound of your post he doesn't which makes your comment even more petty. Do you understand what he sacrificed to be able to take care of you those first few years? Do better because your brother deserves it.", "YTA: He was a victim too and tried his best to help you and shield you from all the crap that was going on around you. He couldn't stop all of it. All of the terrible things that happened to you were because of your parents.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to tell him how you truly feel. What he did then was not good and fucked up your childhood. \n\nBut he was barely a child himself. What he managed to do was totally amazing. With a childhood like this it's no wonder his life had some downs, too. He worked on it and managed to move on from that. Again, an amazing feat.\n\nI think both of you know that he fucked up back then. But was it solely his fault? Didn't his own childhood trauma cause this? It wasn't very nice of you to point it out like that. It seems unthankful and insensitive.", "YTA he was a kid when all this kicked off yet he tried his best and fought for you too. If you want to blame anyone blame your mom", "Agree. Soft YTA. Your 18 year old brother thought for you. He had no idea what he was doing but didn't abandon you. If he did he'd have been in a better place now.  You're mad at the wrong person.", "YTA...your brother was 18 and went through his own shit. He tried his best", "NAH. You both need therapy if you aren\u2019t in it. You can see the good he tried to do and clearly separate it from the bad that happened.  That\u2019s a good thing. He may not be at that point yet. I\u2019m sure it hurt him to realize that some of his problems affected you, but they did. His problems may stem from stepdad though so he likely hasn\u2019t put together that there is a line of struggles that continued to affect you", "I'm not going to give a  judgment because this is definitely above my pay grade. I just want to point out that Lev isn't wrong: everything IS your dad (and your mom's) fault. Even the \"wrong\" things Lev did or didn't do were your dad's fault because Lev never should have had to make the choices or do the things he had to do. \n\nEvery trauma in your life, and every trauma in Lev's life is directly caused by your father. \n\nI'm not going to call you an asshole, but I want you to think about everything Lev went through and have up to try to protect you and give you a better life than he had, and learning that you feel he somehow harmed you was unquestionably a kick in his gut and probably made him feel guilty when he is actually as much a victim, if not an even bigger victim, to your father's abuse than you are. Honestly, if I were  him, I would stop talking to you, too, because knowing you feel that way only adds to his own trauma.\n\nETA... I want to clarify that I think you have a right to express your feelings, but we need to be careful in our phrasing because your phrasing was dismissive of your father's wrongdoing... \"yeah dad did bad things but\" the \"but\" dismisses or diminishes your father's abuse while focusing on you feeling harmed by Lev, so it would have been a lot better if you had talked through with a therapist HOW to express your feelings in a healthy, non-harmful, way.", "Yeah, I'm going to agree with the Soft YTA for the comment itself.  But I saw you said you plan on apologizing and trying to make it up to him which is great and absolutely the right thing to do.  Everyone screws up sometimes and says things that come out too harsh or hurtful.  Important thing is recognizing that and making it right :)", "Nah. You were both wounded and failed by your parents. Both of you. He took on a burden he couldn\u2019t handle and that was very consequential on you when he failed. \n\nYou don\u2019t need a blame game here, you need continued family counseling where you can talk openly about this to heal the wounds you obviously still have. Forgiveness is something earned and learned, hopefully you will both get there.", "NTA, no. You can be grateful for stuff someone did for you and still be aware they fucked up your childhood. Him not understanding that is a *him* problem. \n\nYou take care of yourself OP, i'm glad your life starts to get better, from what i've understood.", "I would say NTA, but also remember that that must have hurt Lev. He might need time to process it", "[deleted]", "NTA: Just because they were trying their best doesn't mean that what they did was right.\n\nYou are allowed your truth, and what happened back then doesn't have to change the forward motion you and your family are taking now.  \n\nThat's something your brother will have to learn to cope with. Some of his actions caused another person harm. He'll have to accept that part of himself, learn from it, and heal from it.\n\nThat's the point of communication in healthy relationships. Putting it out there that something went wrong, and all parties learning how to navigate around it in healthy ways to reach a conclusion of strength, love, and acceptance. \n\nYour brother may need some time, but I think the two of you can work through this. \u2764\ufe0f", "NTA, it\u2019s great that he is doing better now but part of the recovery process is recognizing mistakes and making amends.

He was an 18 year old who was suddenly thrust into the role of taking care of a 10 yr old. The world imploded on him, and he lost custody of you. That experience was horrible for you, but it was also horrible for him. \u201cWe were both burned by our parents, and it impacted our ability to function normally, but we\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d See how that wording acknowledges that he wasn\u2019t perfect, but that you recognize that it wasn\u2019t exactly his fault that he didn\u2019t KNOW what to do to keep you safe, or how to function as an adult when the only role models he had were garbage?

Both went through trauma, repeated abandonment, neglect, and both need to realize they suffered differently.", "The brother was not forced to take custody of OP. The amount of effort required for an 18 year old to get custody is significant, and a much more active and involved decision than deciding to take a chance without a condom.", "NAH except your parents. But when I talk to my therapist about mistakes I made parenting my younger siblings as a teenager (and preteen) she says that it wasn\u2019t my job to parent them and that it\u2019s wrong to blame myself for choices I made when my brain was not developed enough to raise children. Your parents should still have been parenting and emotionally supporting him as well as you and trying to look after you as well as supporting himself as an abused teenager may have tipped him over the edge mentally too.If trying to look after you impacted his mental health, that\u2019s not your fault either, but both of you likely fucked each other up even more than your parents already did.", "NAH\n\nA bit unpopular, but the fact is your brother was not ready to handle the responsibility of raising you. That really sucks, however, it does sound like you were also too young to deal and process a lot of the fallout. Your experiences and feelings are valid. You know he didn't intend to, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen and it wasn't rough for you.\n\nOn his end, it does sound like he was trying his best, and it likely hurt to hear. For you though, you are unable to disassociate your childhood experiences from your brother, so the topic seemed to set you off. At the same point, from his end, he was sacrificing for you. It's a matter of perspective, but considering you were the child and had the least amount of control in your situation, I can't say Y T A for thinking this way", "NAH - You gave your brother an uncomfortable truth, may not have been something that he wanted to hear, it was, however, necessary for him to hear.", "I\u2019m curious to know why you\u2019re not putting any of the blame on your mom? She left you with an abusive narcissist and a 7 year old child to raise you.", "YTA", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to feel the way you do, and so is he. The reality is that you were both in an impossibly difficult situation. He probably did do his best with what he had, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you didn\u2019t pay for the shortcomings. It\u2019s hurtful to hear that your behavior had a negative effect on someone, no matter how hard you tried or what the situation was. It seems to be like you were both just hurt kids doing your best. And honestly, you\u2019re still a kid working through a traumatic childhood. I hope he will come around to understanding that what you said wasn\u2019t to hurt him, but rather to acknowledge the way you feel about the situation", "YTA. He himself was basically a child trying to take care you, definitely a child, after your dad dies and your mother goes AWOL or whatever she did. What you said just stabbed your brother straight through his heart. He did a commendable and heroic thing (imo) in trying to keep you with him, but again, he was a kid too. \n\nIts not that hes also not to blame (tho to a much much lesser degree than your mother or father), but that this is the kind of thing you should never tell anyone without the express purpose of destroying whatever relationship you have. I would never tell my mom that she was a bad mom and could have done better and she contributed to my shitty upbringing, but the reality is that she did. Again, to a much lesser degree than my father, but she did. That doesnt mean i will ever tell her that, because i know she tried. I know she tried VERY hard for my sister and i to have a decent or even semi normal childhood. To tell her that would just fucking kill her. \n\nIDK what to even suggest here to attempt to repair your relationship, because frankly, its not going to be the same.", "YTA. Not a slight, not a hard, just a very honest YTA. He could have let you behind and chose to raise you, did his best and lost himself in the process when he didn't had his own parents to help him to do it. Did you suffer ? Yes, it doesn't make you less legitimate. But because of your parents, not because of him. I mean if you told him this, I hope you also still blame your mother. She also had her reasons, but she still left and so was a part of your pain. \n\nAnd also it was VERY mean to say it to a man who's going to be a father any time now. He has suffer a lot from his own behavior, tried his best to improve himself and now you basically said all his effort were useless.", "Soft YTA.  I hope you can tell your brother that you don\u2019t blame him for any of the bad things that happened.  I think that as you move forward there will be times when painful things from the past come up, and you will both probably say things that sting sometimes.  I hope you can work on apologizing, forgiving, and moving on.  You all deserve some peace, and some kindness.", "YTA and not even a soft one like some people are saying. He was a child too and tried his best. It wasn\u2019t his job to keep you safe or fed or anything he did but he did it regardless of how difficult it made HIS childhood. And you have the audacity to compare him to your vile step father after all he did for you. You should feel ashamed.", "I need to know why you got taken away from your brother at 14. You said some messed up things happened. Did he do something to you or allow someone else to? Then yeah that's completely unrelated to your dad and mom. That's his fault", "NTA \nI get that he was doing the best with what he had, but that doesn't excuse what happened to you. Both of my parents had mental illness and I suffered trauma from their abuse. Was it their \"fault\"? Well, not exactly because their actions were due to an illness that even medications couldn't control. Does that change the fact that they made my childhood hell? No. It doesn't. Your comment was harsh for sure, but I don't think it's fair to say you're an AH. He got messed up from his childhood and then hurt you instead of breaking the cycle, that is true no matter how harsh it sounds.", "YTA \n\nYou are blaming your BROTHER for not being a parent\u2026 why aren\u2019t you putting any blame on your MOTHER??? If she was in contact with him ever since she left then she had to have known your dad was dead\u2026 why didn\u2019t she come out of the woodwork then to get you instead of leaving it up to your brother?", "Echoing everyone else: soft YTA. It makes sense for you to feel that way, but at the same time think about yourself when *you* were the ages he was while all this was happening. My brother was dealing with major medical problems when he was a kid, and I feel bad now that I wasn't that supportive but then I think about how I was only ten, I had no real idea how to deal with that or help, plus I was dealing with all my own growing up shit. Your brother was a kid taking care of a kid, taking on adult responsibilities. Can you imagine yourself at 16, 17, 18 and having to do all that?", "> I said, I feel that some things were his fault as well. **I must have had a weird look on my face**, because he asks \"what?\".\n\nYou told your brother he ruined your childhood and you think he reacted badly because of a *look* you gave?!\n\n\"I told my wife I wanted a divorce but I think she should go to an audiologist because she responded 'what the fuck did you say to me?'\"  YTA", "YTA. It is always easier to blame someone else rather than take responsibility for our behavior and choices. Show your brother and mother how we'll adjusted you are by acting and thinking like an adult.", "Beautifully said.", "Exactly. YTA op. He was a kid and trust me when I say he knows he failed to be the parent you needed, but HE WASNT. He was another kid.", "NTA. He didn't sign up for having crappy parents but he DID sign up to take custody of his sibling. Just because you have trauma doesn't give you a free pass to inflict trauma on others. I have compassion for the issues he was struggling with but part of healing is also taking ownership of how your trauma impacts your actions and relationships.", "Wonderful analogy \ud83e\udd47", "[removed]", "This is really thoughtful", "Oh believe me, I do blame my mom. A lot. When we started talking again three years ago, I was constantly going back and forth on wether or not I even wanted a relationship with her. I was constantly on hair trigger, overanalyzing anything she says and constantly getting into explosive fights.\n\nThat was never the case with Lev. What I said was insensitive and I don't really _blame_ him for what happened to me. I wish I had worded it differently.\n\nI definitely blame my parents way, way more than anyone else.", "I got taken away when I had just turned 12. \nWell, like I said, he had started drinking and sometimes doing drugs. He stopped getting up in the morning, so he also lost his job. Our social worker helped us get on benefits (it's not too hard where we live), but the condition was that he had to go to one job interview a month and pass a sobriety test every six weeks. \n\nWell as you can imagine, he neither passed the pee tests nor went to the job interviews. \nAlso he had stopped making sure there was food in the house, so I frequently went to school without breakfast or lunch. Teachers noticed me losing weight and being unfocused in class, so they sent me to the school counselor. \n\nI mean, I wasn't oblivious to what was happening, I knew he was drinking and doing drugs. But I _really_ wanted to stay with Lev, so I lied to them. \nBut social services came by unannounced a few times and I guess they weren't impressed with what they saw. \nSo I basically just got picked up from school in a cop car one day and brought to a home.", "I am blaming my mother, way way more than I blame Lev.\nAlso, I'm not blaming him for not being a parent. I was talking about some very real and traumatic things that happened to me as a direct result of his choices. \nDoes that make him a villain, an abuser, a bad person? Does that mean I think he's at the same level as my parents? NO IT DOES NOT. He was severely suffering too. I don't blame him for cracking.\nWhat I said was insensitive and unnecessary, 100%. \nHowever, these things happened. I'm not just projecting. I went through awful things and as I was a literal child I take no responsibility for going through them.", "No. I had a weird look on my face, then he asked me \"what?\". I said my insensitive part _afterwards_ .\nI truly accept and understand that I was the asshole in this situation, i do. But please read the post carefully before judging, because that's not how my thought process went.", "> until things go to shit, he starts drinking, loses his job, some bad things happen and I get taken away and put into a home.\n\nNTA, and here's why, if the relationship is going to be fixed, Levi needs to understand the harm they did.  Was it hard on them, yes.  But they hurt a little girl enough that they were taken away and put in foster care.  That is a huge fuck-up, and if they can't acknowledge that, then there are severe problems moving forward in the relationship.   \n    \nThis is your hurt, your pain, and just because Levi does not want to address their part in it, doesn't mean you should not try and work through it.", "You're both hurting.  If you could pull off therapy for the both of you, I'd recommend it.  Think about it, your brother was far from perfect, but it was the responsibility of you parents to be there, care and raise both of you.  In the end this all goes back to them and this laies at their feet.  All his mistakes with you wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for their unfortunate actions.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

And then what, just because she was 14 at the time he lost her nothing was his responsibility? Yeah, NTA he needs to embrace the truth.\n\n(And don't forget he was in contact the entire time with the woman who abandoned a 3yo daughter to an abuser.)", "On the other hand, if he didn't fight for custody and she ended up in foster care which is famously broken, would she have accused him of messing up her childhood for not fighting?", "I was raised by my brother as well due to very similar circumstances. Your brother isn't the one to blame though, he was hurting and used drugs and drinking to dull the pain. This is ultimately your parents fault, your father for obvious reasons and your mother who knowingly left you and your brother in an abusive situation.", "Well that is pretty traumatic. NTA but I can see why he's hurt. But I would think his therapy would include knowing he messed up but also forgiving himself. I don't think pretending is helping anyone.", "What I\u2019m saying is that I don\u2019t see anything as his fault\u2026 what happened was a direct result of your parents actions and he just did the best he could with what he had. He was a child too trying to take care of you. \n\nAlso you should add that you do blame your mom too because it\u2019s not in the OP", "> If either of them said that to me, it would break me to be honest.\n\nBut you can't move forward sincerely without acknowledging the harm you have done.  While we may understand how it got to the position, Levi drank and hurt the OP enough that the OP ended up being taken away and put in foster care.  That has to be owned up to for a relationship to be fixed.  Right now, Levi is putting all of the work, the pain, everything on the OP again.", "Thanks for your comment. We are both in therapy, and so is my mom. Lev and I have sessions once a month together and each have a session once every three months with our mom.", "Hi! \n\nAs someone who bounced in and out of foster homes and living with extended relatives due to:\n \n-a deadbeat dad that disappeared and later died of a drug overdose \n-physically and emotionally abusive mom who struggled with both alcohol and heroin abuse \n\nand was later given to her 19 year old sister who fought for custody of her (I was 8 at this time), I can relate to OP greatly. \n\nOPs brother does need to recognize that his alcoholism negatively impacted OP. From the post, it looks like OP did not actively \u201caccuse\u201d her brother of anything. She held back a comment and then when pressed, spoke honestly. I don\u2019t believe she was actively trying to hurt him and is probably very grateful to him. With these thoughts in mind I withheld judgment because there\u2019s too many layers for me to consider (based off of my personal experience). \n\nWhat I do take issue to is a comment that says \u201cThink about how badly YOU fucked up HIS childhood.\u201d \n\nWhen OP \u201cfucked up his childhood\u201d, she was 10 years old and had absolutely nothing to do with any of the decisions that were being made apart from wanting to stay with the only family member she had. Sure, she\u2019s older now and both her and her brother are still working through their trauma, but that comment was aimed towards OP when she was aged roughly 10-14. \n\nThere is not a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think about how because of me my sister never had the chance to go to college and that impacted the rest of her life. (It\u2019s been about 19 years). That comment was unnecessarily cruel and honestly it was victim blaming. \n\nMaybe OP would have been upset him if Lev didn\u2019t try for her, but it does not appear from her post that she is ungrateful for when he did try for her.\n\nThanks for listening!", "This was my thought- her brother was fucked either way. I\u2019d also wager that he took the brunt of abuse growing up being older and the step kid. Op getting a crappy draw in life is not the same as her brother fucking up her life.", "That's good, I hope the best for you all.", "Not even Lev's dad, levs bio mother left him with a step parent. Op describes her dad as bad, I'm sure Lev got it worse.", "Ok, so my post may have been misunderstood.   I think its more a situation where there is no winners unfortunately.  He he didn't try there are good odds things would have unfolded poorly for her too.  For me the real problems are the parents. They should have stepped up, they should have been there.  None of the brothers mistakes would have happened if they just did what they were meant to do.  Reading this I can't help but feel angry for both of them, and angry at neither of them (the siblings).", "Oh no, I agree with you. I am saddened for both OP and her brother. They never should have been put in this situation to begin with, but such is life I guess."]}
