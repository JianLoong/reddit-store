Originally when we were invited we thought it was going to be 6 people. When we got to the house before dinner we found it was 12 people. Of those 12 people we were friends with two including the host\u201dSarah\u201d 32F and her boyfriend \u201cJohn\u201d 32M. A few people we had met at previous occasions that Sarah had hosted along with mutual friends. It\u2019s a smaller community we moved to three years ago.\n\nThe night started at Sarah\u2019s house prior to the event at a nice restaurant. There was wine being served and my wife kindly refused as she is six weeks pregnant. At this point we haven\u2019t told many people including Sarah. Sarah was pretty persistent on my wife drinking as they are friends. My wife then told her she is pregnant as well as most of the people in the party found out at the same time. We didn\u2019t expect to be telling a large group of people as this is very early on in the pregnancy and our first time getting pregnant.\n\nWe get to dinner the plates are around $30/person and there\u2019s a lot of appetizers ordered. Also there is a large amount of alcohol being ordered. I was drinking and obviously my wife was not. The bill comes out with the final being close to $1500 total for 12 people and close to $700 was alcohol and $500 food. Someone had ordered $120 bottles of wine along the way. We were told to pay $150 per person. My wife tried to talk to  Sarah the host but was ignored. We didn\u2019t feel right to have pay for the alcohol equally as My wife didn\u2019t drink any. At this point I\u2019m pretty intoxicated so I wasn\u2019t much use to speak up. I sent over $200 to the guy who put his card down this was the $150 for me plus the extra $50 that covered more than my wife\u2019s meal she had. Snapped a picture of the check to refer back to tomorrow. Figured we could deal with it later as our group is all now heavily intoxicated.\n\nThe following evening I get a text saying \u201cHey you venmoed him $200 instead of $300 for you and your wife It was $150/person!\u201d I apologized for not explaining last night that we didn\u2019t feel it was fair for us to pay for the alcohol for My wife since she didn\u2019t drink. I was massively hungover and it completely slipped my mind. It then turned into a downhill battle about how this messes up things for everyone else. I mention it would be an extra $10 from all individuals instead of an extra $100 from us. Then I was told that when you go to group dinners you are expected to pay the equal amount. I kept saying I\u2019ll contact everyone to let them know I personally don\u2019t have their phone numbers so I asked for them. Next thing you know I\u2019m getting text messages from her boyfriend who is my friend about how I was a scumbag for not paying the full amount. The texts from both circled around how they didn\u2019t know she was pregnant. Basically said I shouldn\u2019t have come if we didn\u2019t intend on splitting the bill evenly. I was pretty taken back on this concept plus their reaction. \n\nSo, AITA for not splitting the bill evenly?\n\nEdit: Rachel = wife. I\u2019m not good with fake names.\n\nEdit2: per a suggestion I did the math and split the food plus non alcohol for 12 people and alcohol for 11 people. Technically we should have paid $216. Add on I dont drink wine.\n\nEdit3: I get that I should have said something then but mistakes happen. I also understand they would have to text people to reconcile the missed amount. If I had their numbers I would do it myself. I apologized for inconvenience. What I\u2019m focused on is the fact that Rachel and her bf said we deserve to pay the full split price. They are adamant we should pay the extra $100.\n\nUPDATE: It continued to spiral to the point as Sarah sent me the list of peoples venmo account to request the difference. As she said she said they are not cheap enough to request $10/person. I sent a venmo for the remaining $100 to the cardholder and apologized for the miscommunication. Then decided to text the people letting them there was a miscalculation, then explaining what happened let them know Sarah was unwilling to text them. Everyone was very nice and paid me back almost immediately. Offered to hang out again. Lesson learned on how to speak up at the time but in the end I feel the overwhelming people think I was NTA...", "created_utc": 1667218331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yia4ra/aita_for_not_splitting_the_bill_evenly/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe chalk it down to a lesson learnt?", "I tend to find that it evens out over the day, month, year.\n\nThere will be times you drink $90 and miss out on ten bucks and times you drink $120 and you win\n\nObviously I\u2019m using round numbers but you might get the message", "After the fact is too late. You should have paid (and you still should). The hosts asked everyone for their share and they are the ones now covering your shortfall.  Next time you should ask the server *ahead of time* to keep your order separate if you aren't willing to just split evenly.  Trying to figure out fair shares for 12 people would be a disaster even if most of you weren't hammered.\n\nYTA", "You did not dispute it at the time. Because you were drunk. Why didn't your wife dispute it? Has she no agency?\n\nYou got drunk so did not raise an objection at the time. You sought to retroactively change the agreement. Now the person everyone owes for the bill has to chase everyone down for an extra ten dollars or so or they have to eat the 100 you didn't pay.\n\nYTA for going along with it then changing your mind.", "I already said I don\u2019t think it is fair you need to pay the extra 100$, if I was your friend I would say during the billing that you should pay less, but if you didn\u2019t say anything during the event, it is even more unfair to change the agreement of payment for everyone.", "I was confused too.  Was Rachel the wife  or friend?", "But you did and you didn\u2019t drink cocktails that could easily be quantified, you shared with the group. So you could have easily drank double what someone else drank so why should they pay as much as you? You can\u2019t share bottles of alcohol and then try to nickel and dime people.", "Of course he could. But there were 10 other people at the table with (I assume) morals who could have said something too.", "That's my point, you waited until the bill was there to suddenly say that you have a problem paying. You should have spoken to the Host before the dinner and made your intentions clear.", "Tax tip. You\u2019re correct.", "Well presumably she ate some of the apps too. And there may have been tax. So $50 was likely low.", "I agree it won\u2019t happen again. But is that a $100 lesson learnt? Or is it Rachel the one who do the split being the host a good friend sending a few text messages to help clarify a better solution.", "This is where I fall and I HATE haggling over the bill. If wife normally drinks or eats apps then I\u2019m sure there\u2019s been times when they come out ahead at the end of the night.", "You\u2019re correct we should have but this is new to us. I agree we should pay for our share this wouldn\u2019t include the alcohol since my wife didn\u2019t drink any.", "Why should they? Everybody in the group knew OPs wife was pregnant, as she told them hours earlier. Therefore everyone was aware that she DID NOT CONSUME THE ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES. If you still expect someone to pay for the alcohol after that, you are an asshole by default.", "Using your logic your saying because someone is drunk and I was drunk it\u2019s okay to (insert blank ie rob, rape, or anything) someone because they were drunk and didn\u2019t say anything at the time.", "Edited it for the names.", "I didn\u2019t know a $100 difference is a nickel and dime.", "So they are responsible for keeping track of OP's business? OP said he didn't even know many of those people.", "That\u2019s one of those things that sound better in your mind but doesn\u2019t always happen in reality.", "I didn't haggle on the apps but my wife is actually allergic to shellfish.  The apps were all shellfish. I was only focused on the alcohol.", "I think it's on you. If your friends usually split the bill and you decide not to for personal reasons then it's up to you to communicate that at the time or in advance. You changed the social norm for your group retroactively without discussion and caused a complication where someone is down $100. It's not even a case of you getting their numbers to fix it, your friend would have to message them first asking if it's OK to pass numbers on etc. You've caused a hassle and not really understood why (I could be wrong on that I admit). \n\nIn my friendship group we tend to split food evenly then divide up the booze by drinkers only. But we've always done this as some of us don't drink. It wouldn't be discussed at the beginning as that's how it's always been. If someone wanted to change this system we'd expect it to be discussed at the time not the following day when we realise we've been short changed and had to chase them up.", "You\u2019re being obtuse. It sounds like EVERY SINGLE TIME you eat with this group you split evenly. Sometimes you pay more, sometimes less. It evens out. This time you changed the rules, BUT DIDNT TELL ANYONE, at least when you were all sober enough (and your partner was ALWAYS sober enough), so YOU fucked up. Some one ELSE was generous enough to put THEIR card down and take the risk of AHs not paying the AGREED TO share, and now they are paying for YOU being too drunk/lazy to address it at the time. YOU KNEW when you vemo\u2019d a lower amount that no one else was making up your \u201cshortfall\u201d and that the cardholder would have to eat it OR chase every one else around for $10. A fair number of whom will be like you and say \u201cnot my problem\u201d. So again, THEY GET FUCKED because you decided to SILENTLY PROTEST the usual division of food and drink. \n\nYes. YTA. If you won\u2019t eat the full cost of YOUR MISTAKE/CARELESSNESS, cover whatever the cardholder doesn\u2019t recover when they RE-ASK people for more money.", "It would be fine if OP had brought it up at the time. He couldn't be bothered, so it's everyone else's fault? If it didn't occur to him to bring it up at the time, and it didn't occur to his sober wife to bring it up, it's somehow everybody else's fault?", "JFC, why do men always compare losing money to losing FUCKING BODILY AUTONOMY?", "That's a really extreme comparison. There was obviously a time before he got drunk when he could have brought it up. He didn't discuss it with anyone afterwards. He just sent less money without any discussion before payment.\n\nThe other people did not rob, r\\*pe, or otherwise criminally trespass on OP.", "Not responsible, no. But in a table of 12 people, I'm astounded that everyone expects a pregnant woman to pay for alcohol she said she wasn't drinking. No matter how drunk you are. \n\nOP should have brought it up at the table when he was paying, no doubt about it. But there were 10 other people there as well, how no one else thought of this (including Sarah the host who Rachel spoke to at the table about this and was ignored) and thinks the responsibility falls on OP alone is beyond me.", "Yep, YTA.  It doesn't happen in reality because you didn't make it happen.  I don't drink, especially when we go out and I know I'm driving, so I make it point of telling the host that I'm not drinking. It's that simple. Its sounds easy in the mind because it is easy. Only someone with no respect towards others would wait until the end to haggle a bill.", "The OP had never met these people before. Where are you getting the EVERY SINGLE TIME?\n\n(Also you could calm down with the caps.)", "I don\u2019t personally see 11 drunk people trying to negotiate a bill going well seeing as the argument from the other attendees is that his pregnant wife should pay for what they drank. If you believe a pregnant women should pay for other people to get drunk, the timing of sorting it out won\u2019t make a difference.\n\nEdit: And his wife was probably fed up with dealing with a table of intoxicated people and felt awkward to bring it up. They\u2019re not actually friends with them all, it was probably very uncomfortable for her after having to share her news unexpectedly already.", "So what if it\u2019s extreme? It\u2019s still a good comparison. \n\nNTA", "We showed up drunk.", "OP or his wife could have brought it up at the time. It would have been nice if someone else had thought of it, but they weren't responsible. Inconsiderate, maybe, but not responsible.\n\nYou are contradicting yourself saying the others aren't responsible:\n\n>Not responsible, no.\n\nYet you say:\n\n>how no one else thought of this (...) and thinks the   \nresponsibility falls on OP alone is beyond me.\n\nIf OP or his wife had brought up how the bill should be split at the time and had people objected at the time, they would be the AHs.\n\nInstead the person who paid the bill who everyone is paying back has to chase down all the other guests and ask them for more money or has to eat the difference himself.", "Thank you for saying this /u/Slow_Orange_239 this was definitely the sentiment we felt. My wife did try to say something but the host was too drunk to acknowledge it.", "He could have let the person collecting on Venmo know any time prior to making the payment.", "OP said \"my wife tried talking to Sarah but was ignored.\"\n\nI stand by my statement. Others aren't responsible for pointing out the discrepancy in the payment each person had to make, but they were inconsiderate (as you said). It's the same thing to me in this scenario (and many others in fact). If there is a pregnant woman with you, I think it's basic human behaviour to look out for her well being.\n\nSorry for not using quotes, I don't know how to", "Not a problem at all, I\u2019m currently 37w pregnant and could not imagine dealing with all of that drama! No energy for that when growing a little human! Pleased to see your update and that it all worked out :)", "I reread the post after your comment.\n\nSarah tried to cajole OP's wife into drinking and that was an a-hole thing to do.\n\nSarah ignored OP's wife regarding the bill. You are correct. \n\nSarah was the a-hole. \n\nI concede the point. You are correct.", "I can\u2019t imagine going honestly. They don\u2019t know the people well and the fact that they pregamed was a great indicator of the night ahead. I would\u2019ve noped out of that so fast. I\u2019m 28ish weeks with my second and can\u2019t imagine that was a fun evening for her.", "I'm glad you saw my point of view. I see yours too. OP could and should have done better. But I feel like everyone failed that night in some way, except OP's wife.\n\nIn conclusion, OP needs to sort out the missing $100 asap. He can either talk to everyone, explain the situation, hope they understand and agree to put up the extra 10$ each. If not, he should put up the $100 himself or run the risk of being ostracized by his friends. \n\nI've personally been in the receiving end of someone not paying everything they should have and many times I've been put out of pocket by these people, who I've usually known who it was. Rest assured repeat offenders usually end up losing their friends over silly things like this."]}
