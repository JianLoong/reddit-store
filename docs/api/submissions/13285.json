This has been a tradition since I was maybe eleven years old and I'm now 27. Each year, my parents and the other family's parents alternate who plans and pays for the vacation. This year is our family friends' turn.\n\nI'm getting married in just a few weeks. We were planning on going on our honeymoon towards the end of the year but haven't put specific plans in place yet. I work for my dad and can pretty much get off whenever I'd like but she only has so much PTO, so we're trying to be strategic with our plans. I told everyone I would likely have to skip the vacation this year because of my fianc\u00e9e's work situation and our honeymoon.\n\nLast week, my \"bonus dad\" came to me and told me he had booked a room for me and my girlfriend was more than welcome to come along too if she changed her mind, but that he was insistent on the family being together for the trip. Honestly, there's nothing that can beat the vacations we take. The places are great and the company is even greater. My sister is so busy these days and lives out of state, so I get to catch up with her. The family we travel with has three sons who are some of my closest friends. Beyond all of that, you can't really beat an all expenses paid holiday.\n\nI told my fianc\u00e9e about this and she's very angry I didn't immediately shut it down. I told her that we weren't required to constantly do family activities and this could easily serve as part one to our honeymoon. We haven't started planning so there's no real plans to derail, and we can have our actual honeymoon as a first anniversary celebration since we weren't planning on going right after our wedding anyway.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679887486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1239t3n/aita_for_agreeing_to_go_on_a_family_vacation_in/", "score": 200, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's an anniversary. Going on vacation with other people isn't a honeymoon, either. \n\nAnd you said she only has so much PTO.
