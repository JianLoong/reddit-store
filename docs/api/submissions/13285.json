This has been a tradition since I was maybe eleven years old and I'm now 27. Each year, my parents and the other family's parents alternate who plans and pays for the vacation. This year is our family friends' turn.\n\nI'm getting married in just a few weeks. We were planning on going on our honeymoon towards the end of the year but haven't put specific plans in place yet. I work for my dad and can pretty much get off whenever I'd like but she only has so much PTO, so we're trying to be strategic with our plans. I told everyone I would likely have to skip the vacation this year because of my fianc\u00e9e's work situation and our honeymoon.\n\nLast week, my \"bonus dad\" came to me and told me he had booked a room for me and my girlfriend was more than welcome to come along too if she changed her mind, but that he was insistent on the family being together for the trip. Honestly, there's nothing that can beat the vacations we take. The places are great and the company is even greater. My sister is so busy these days and lives out of state, so I get to catch up with her. The family we travel with has three sons who are some of my closest friends. Beyond all of that, you can't really beat an all expenses paid holiday.\n\nI told my fianc\u00e9e about this and she's very angry I didn't immediately shut it down. I told her that we weren't required to constantly do family activities and this could easily serve as part one to our honeymoon. We haven't started planning so there's no real plans to derail, and we can have our actual honeymoon as a first anniversary celebration since we weren't planning on going right after our wedding anyway.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679887486, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1239t3n/aita_for_agreeing_to_go_on_a_family_vacation_in/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you can\u2019t do that, don\u2019t marry her, for her sake.", "YTA.  If you can\u2019t figure out that you should be including your fianc\u00e9 in the honeymoon plans and that it should be something you decide together, then you\u2019re not ready to get married.", "AGREEING? YTA. But the important piece of information here? Is that your fianc\u00e9 is pissed. So shut it down. I can understand her feelings. I hope you can too. Act accordingly. Because that's where your bread is buttered.", "I mean why get married if you want to go on a family vacation instead of with new wife", "You are getting married. Your priorities need to be realigned to the family you created. By the way Im using up this year's vacation time to go on a family trip (which I guess you can come too) instead of a honeymoon which will have to be postponed until next year IF nothing comes up to derail that is NOT prioritizing your created family. You need to check yourself because you need to put her first or this is going to be the start of a lot of conflict of you putting her on the back burner to them the second they demand it.", "It's cool that your family and family friends do vacations every year or whatever, but you're about to be married and you can't even put into consideration your fianc\u00e9e and her life. You expect her to just go along with your plans and traditions, talking about \"we can have our honeymoon as our first year anniversary celebration.\" That's not a honeymoon anymore. That's an anniversary. Going on vacation with other people isn't a honeymoon, either. \n\nAnd you said she only has so much PTO. So if she uses her PTO on your family/friend vacation, is she going to have to do that again next year and forgo another couple's trip to appease you and go to these annual vacations?\n\nYTA", "YTA.

Honeymoon is a once in a lifetime romantic experience (dependent on how many times you marry obviously) with all the bodily fun a newly wed couple are capable of, post marriage.

But also: it's kind of odd that your bonus dad was totally okay with her not coming but 'insisting' that you come. That's a weird thing for a family member to say, 'your new wife doesn't have to go but you absolutely should'.", "YTA. You\u2019re fianc\u00e9e should come before all others. No one in their right mind wants family on their honeymoon.", "I wouldn\u2019t say a hole but definitely would not be my first choice of honeymoon and I think\n it\u2019s acceptable for her to feel offended by the insinuation that a vacation with your family and your friends is supposed to serve as a honeymoon which typically is supposed to be a romantic getaway dedicated to the couple..\n\nIf she has enough time off maybe invite her to a vacation but still have a honeymoon just the 2 of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
