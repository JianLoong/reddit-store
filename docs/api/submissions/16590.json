We don't smoke, drink etc. We are totally straightedge by choice and have no problems with that. \n\nToday my brother in law (28) came over and we had a good time with him, visiting catching up etc. he brought out a bag of candy and we started eating a bunch of different nostalgic things like laffy taffy and jolly ranchers. Then he brought out a bag of what looked like gumdrops and said I couldn't have any because I'm currently pregnant. I was extremely confused because I didn't even know that my brother in law started taking edibles (apparently this is a new thing for him). \n\nAnyways, BIL gave the bag to my husband and encouraged him to take one. I immediately was taken aback and asked him why he brought those here and said that we don't do that kind of stuff. BIL didn't believe that we have never been 'high' and definitely chucked about it. After a lot of back and forth and me asking my husband not to take one, he still did it. \n\nBIL admitted that after my husband ate one he was shocked because he didn't think that he would. I feel like that was the root cause of all of this, but really i'm not sure. \n\nAnyways, we were supposed to watch a movie but after that I said that I needed to do some work and I went into the other room where I am currently typing this. They asked me to stay and hang out and I declined. \n\nHusband came in  to check on me and asked if i had told anyone, I said 'why, would you be embarrassed if I did?' he said 'yes'. \n\nSo, yes..

Your husband may no longer believe so strictly that it is wrong to take an edible. I also believe that your strict adherence to a \"straightedge\" existence has left you prone to judging people who don't follow your behaviors. Being worried about embarrassment and shame is never healthy and I encourage you to keep that negativity out of your relationship.\n\nHowever I also acknowledge that this is a change from your perspective. I think that if you use this opportunity to improve communication and lessen judgment in your relationship, then NAH.", "NAH.  There is no conflict.\n\nI *personally* think it's a little bit silly to be mad about it - especially as you are in a fully legal state.  But being disappointed is a feeling, and feeling a way doesn't make you an asshole.\n\nBut to be clear, he's not an asshole for doing it either.\n\nUltimately, there is no conflict here.", "NAH.\nBecause it sounds like you've been really proud of never having tried drugs, and equally proud that you and your husband were together in that. \n\nHe isn't on that same page anymore. \n\nThat can feel really threatening, to your sense of identity. To your sense of who he is as a man. \n\nIf your being totally drug free is an important part of how you see yourself, and now it turns out it wasn't for him... that makes everything feel unsettled. So you aren't an asshole for feeling distress. For feeling disappointed. \n\nBut he's not an ahole either. Maybe it was not as important to his sense of identity as it was to yours. Maybe it was, but as he's grown and aged he wants to explore that a little more. \nMaybe he just felt his brother was trying to shame him and he got mad and tried it just to shut his brother up. \n\nIn the past ten years, as more and more states have legalized without massive problems happening, many people have begun to change their mind about trying things. It may be that your husband is one of those people. \n\nYou aren't a bad person for feeling disappointed  but also try to keep perspective and not make it bigger than it needs to be.\nTomorrow you should ask him to fill you in on his feelings about it all.", "NAH\n\nI understand that you may be kind of taken aback at the fact your husband took an edible especially as you guys are straight edge. While I don\u2019t think you are the AH I don\u2019t think what your husband did is wrong either.\n\nAt the end of the day you are both adults and are entitled to your own opinions. I would say maybe try talking to your husband to see why he decided to take it and explain your feelings as well.  If he wants to take edibles every once and a while you can\u2019t really do anything about that (especially as it is legal in California) but I think it is important to talk about your feelings and not bottle them up.", "I mean...I don't get why people are so judgmental about taking a relatively harmless substance. Would him drinking a single beer bother you this much? If so, why? This really does seem like an overreaction to me. I get it, there are people that are heavily reliant on substances, and that really does become a problem, but people were fed so much propaganda as kids and adults about gateway drugs and all that nonsense that people make being drug/alcohol free a personality trait. I think it may be time to explore why you have such a negative reaction to this.", "Soft YTA because your reaction was kind of childish and probably made him anxious during his first time high and he was probably worried you were going to leave him or call the cops or something.\n\nBut also agree with others that you're allowed to have feelings about it and remove yourself from a situation where people are taking drugs even if it's 'just' weed just maybe you could have done it in a more tactful way", "Is it a religious thing?

Are you for real?  Instead of having a mature, adult conversation with your husband, you gave him the cold shoulder, lied about needing to do work, and then sulked in a room by yourself while typing out your victim story for a bunch of internet strangers?  YTA for this reason alone.", "INFO: Is it legal in your state?", "Yes, YTA.\nYour hubby had ONE gummy. Which was probably 10mg THC.\nNot a high dose.

Why do you feel that way over a legal substance?", "Soft YTA imo. \n\nI get it somewhere, but its one edible. Its not like he's snorting coke every day in the bathroom since his brother brought it. \n\nPeople change and while you might still be straight edge, that doesn't mean he still isn't interested in that kind of stuff. You can't force people to try them, but you also can't force people to not do them. If this is a deal breaker for you, then you need to speak on this \n\nBut staying silent and feeling disgusted comes across as judgemental and very shallow.", "OP's post history in the last year regarding their husband is a wild ride. I think they've got way more things going on than the dude taking one edible once.", "YTA. sometimes, people do substances to have fun or relax. it implies absolutely nothing about them, their morals, or their personality. you're over 30, most people grow out of this D.A.R.E. ass mindset by 15.", "Soft YTA. I considered N A H at first, but your reaction seems a bit over dramatic and immature. Like, I get why you\u2019d feel weird about it in the sense that it seems to go against what you thought you knew about your husband. But at the end of the day (a) it was ONE edible in a safe environment and (b) it was weed, so not something illegal in your location or *physically* addicting or at risk of many side effects and (c)  it seems more like something to have a conversation about later than to judge and sulk about. \n\nYou\u2019re not an A H about your feelings, to be clear - I just think the way you\u2019ve expressed them is a bit disproportionate given the circumstances.", "Seems pretty harsh from you, soft YTA. \nHe wanted to try something out, enjoy some experiences with his brother, hang out, catch up. They have a relationship too, one that has gone back probably to boys doing dumb stuff as kids, and therefore for your husband to want to do something that he\u2019s curious about is perfectly normal and that relationship is a safe space for him to do so. \nAs you have no experience you also potentially overreacted, one gummy will not cause everlasting change in someone. You really haven\u2019t lost out on anything and potentially caused him to lose out on a normal and interesting experience with his brother because you made him self conscious about something that is a non issue. I get that you both are \u201cstraightedge\u201d but one gummy is not enough to feel some sort of betrayal from him.", "Yta", "YTA he's a grown man you don't get to TELL him what he can and cannot put in his body.", "NTA Your feelings are valid and the brother in law an AH for facilitating and promoting drug use.", "I would ask, why might your husband want to? Is he stressed about the new baby? Perhaps he needs a break or relief. Which could be very legit, if he\u2019s working a lot or stressing, even if he says he\u2019s not. Parenthood is a big transition, and men are often conditioned to be the strong one. Something to consider.", "YTA. My god", "I\u2019m going to say YTA because you seem to think your husband and you have one mind. You mentioned not taking drugs is a choice, and he chose differently.", "YTA and a control freak, apparently. Disappointed in you.", "YTA, he wanted to try something it's not like he's getting high on a regular basis.", "YTA. Your views towards substances are archaic and outdated.", "NTA. As a fellow straightedge it's not fun remaining a straightedge with someone who wants to experiment. Your husband was your safe space away from drugs and alcohol. So much of adult culture is centered around those things it's tiring for those of us who don't want to partake.\n\nYou did loose a significant part of your relationship that most people don't understand. It's wonderful to have a partner when you choose a lifestyle outside the cultural norm, and very painful when they abandon it.\n\nI will also point out that it also puts you in a sucky position. Everybody has a boundary for how often they want to deal with a high or drunk spouse while they're sober. Before that number was by default 0 and it was easy. Now you have to come up with a number and if he doesn't like it you're \"controlling\". And if your number is too low this subreddit will say you're \"controlling\" until it magically crosses that arbitrary line of \"this is excessive and acceptable to be concerned about\".\n\nAlso you're pregnant. This first time was a big journey for him that you couldn't even share with him if you so choose. That's a dick move on his part.", "NTA.

Your husband behaved out of character and it unsettled you. He in that moment moved the goal posts of what you understand to be true about him. \n\n2. Your husband gave into peer pressure like a teenager. (You are pregnant and possibly want an adult partner not someone who can\u2019t say no to his brother/friends like he\u2019s 12 \n\nInfo is this your first baby? \n\n3.

Even as a couple who drinks, my husband will ask me if it's OK if he has a beer if I'm not drinking - I would never say no but it's just an acknowledgement that I might have feelings about him drinking. It changes his ability to be responsible for things like driving or even, depending on how much he consumes, his ability to function the next day. It affects a partner. It's just responsible to make sure you're both on the same page when it comes to mind-altering substances. I'm sure if he asked you and discusses why he wanted to and acknowledged why you might not want him to you wouldn't be so upset if he ate one. Plus the brother is an asshole for bringing them to your house without asking if he knows you're not the sort of people who partake. I wouldn't bring alcohol to the house of someone I know doesn't drink without checking how they feel.", "NTA\n\nThe fact that he would be embarrassed if you told anyone is very telling.", "Info: you said your both straightedge by choice - is he vocal about it? Is he proud of it? Is he now disappointed in himself?", "NTA; you made clear you didn't want it in your house, he did it despite your concerns. On top of that you were the only sober one out of three. Chances that it goes wrong are slim, but a pregnant woman shouldn't be responsible for trip sitting, especially not involuntarily. I've seen people go bad on the bare minimum of what could be considered drugs and have been around my fair share of drugs. \n\nHe should have given you at least the chance to stay somewhere else or do his edibles somewhere else, if you don't want to be confronted with it, you don't have to. \n\nYou also really need to discuss boundaries. My partner quit drinking, I barely drink, we discuss before we have someone over what we'll allow. Certain people are not allowed to drink at our house (we made a decision to have no drunk-drama in our lives) and no-one is allowed to smoke or do drugs. \n\n13 years of no drug use is enough to imply that a discussion is needed before your partner does (harmless) drugs in the home.

If you guys have chosen this puritanical lifestyle and you asked him not to do it, he should have listened to your opinion. That doesn\u2019t mean he has to do it, but you should have had a discussion. \n\n\nI know you think he likes these choices that you have made, but it\u2019s likely that he\u2019s curious about experimenting with things and you would be well served to try to be open minded about it. It\u2019s not really a big deal but if you overreact every time he\u2019s curious, you will likely push him away. Try to be a team and lose the judgy attitude. It never helps any situation to be closed minded.", "NAH. \n\nI mean, what is the harm in it?", "NTA. Yeah it\u2019s a low dose. I\u2019m grateful that was the case, but after having gone without substances as such for years, your partner blindsiding you with an act you had never thought he\u2019d partake in could\u2019ve given you emotional whiplash. \n\nThose saying you\u2019re childish are downright cruel. It\u2019s like saying your partner didn\u2019t cheat with someone at least when he goes to a strip club once to \u2018try it out\u2019 despite never having watched porn or been at those types of scenes. \n\nThese are things that can be deal breakers for many and even one time instances can cause a rift. I\u2019d call your husband an ass if he wasn\u2019t receptive of your feelings about the situation at least. \n\nI don\u2019t do drugs or drink because it\u2019s not interesting to me. Though I\u2019ve tried some weed, and if my partner were to continuously practice one thing to then on a whim try it out I\u2019d be upset because it\u2019d be normal to overthink if this means they\u2019ll be trying out other things I\u2019m not comfortable having in my relationship.", "NTA. You two had discussed your life choices many, many times over the years, and he never once discussed wanting to change anything. Then, knowing it would upset you, he made the choice. You have every right to be upset. It doesn't matter whether it's harmless or legal you two had an agreement in your relationship. Plus, I imagine it's difficult watching your husband fold so easily under pressure. You feel betrayed, and it's ok. You will talk about it and work through it, but do not feel guilty for having feelings about this.", "I understand why you feel that way because I was once totally against using substances besides alcohol. Then I became interested in what it's like to experience other substances. So in a short time (like a year) I went from only having used alcohol to having tried magic mushrooms, mdma, nicotine and weed. I think it's only natural for human beings to explore altered states of consciousness. You'd be in a very small minority having not have touched any of these things by your 30s.

Many of the long term health damages and illnesses that are caused by alcohol happen in so called moderate drinkers.
