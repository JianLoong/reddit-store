And we will never BE close. I have a half brother, we\u2019ll call him X. X is oldest of the \u2018siblings\u2019. I put that in quotations because I\u2019d rather not deal with X. The reason why we were never close is probably because he was graduating high school my 6th grade year. Also, I didn\u2019t have to see him all the time. \n\nFast forward. I\u2019m in 10th grade. I should mention that I live in a VERY small town\u2014word gets around. Someone comes up to me in the lunch line and asked me if I had seen my brother on the news. I hadn\u2019t. I won\u2019t get into the specifics, but just know it was a sex related crime. After this was committed, I really wanted nothing to do with him. I just felt embarrassment and disgust towards him. He was sentenced, and went to prison. It was a sigh of relief for me, because I wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the drama anymore.\n\nWhen I\u2019m in college, he gets released. My mom tells me all of the stories about him and how he had such a hard time in prison and blah  blah blah. I don\u2019t want to see him.\n\nHe bounces from place to place because he can\u2019t get his life together. He expects people to always be there whenever there\u2019s a fallout. I have had him blocked on facebook for a while, because he posted some really hateful, disgusting things. And I just didn\u2019t want to see that. And it worked. Until this year. He makes a new facebook. And somehow I don\u2019t know who added who. But now we\u2019re friends. I dont really interact with him. Because his morals are just not aligned with mine and I\u2019m not trying to start drama.\n\nLast christmas, my mom asked if I was going to get him a present. I told her no. She told me that I was being ridiculous, and that he\u2019s my brother, and I need to get over whatever I didn\u2019t like about him. Because we\u2019re family.\n\nI\u2019d like to point out that I don\u2019t think that you should be forced to interact with family members if they\u2019re toxic. If you need to burn that bridge, burn it. I would be MORE than happy to never speak to him again. If I end up getting married, I don\u2019t want him at my wedding. I just don\u2019t. I don\u2019t consider him my brother. \n\nIt might be bitchy because I just want the distance between us. But I KNOW if I went no contact, my mom would pull the same old line. And then she would bring my other family members into as well. I should add, I\u2019m over 25, and have been living with my partner since 2019.\n\nDoes that make me the ass hole?", "created_utc": 1699906418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ujn9n/aita_for_wanting_nothing_to_do_with_my_halfbrother/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That isn't something that you just \"get over\". Being kin in some way does not paper over the fact that he is a sex offender. \n\n(I'd probably delete and block his new facebook too, if that hasn't already been done ...

Things like celebrating Christmas with her on a different day. Make sure she knows that you're not asking her to take sides. Only to respect your boundaries. Expect it to be hard for her and offer whatever emotional support you can.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso, just FYI:\n\nThe proverb \"blood is thicker than water\" is an abbreviated version of another proverb and completely reverses its meaning.\n\nThe original proverb is \"The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.\" It means that the bonds we choose are stronger than those we're born to. \\[Its origins are unclear.\\] \n\nSo, yes, blood is thicker than water.
