She did not ask me if I would be okay with it. I know she doesn't need to and I don't expect her to ask my permission. I just don't like the idea of a death head moth as a tattoo. I have an unnatural dislike towards those months and always have. Yes it is probably something I need therapy for and I am in the process of getting some but it's slow going.\n\nThe tattoo itself is also going to be very expensive and we do share finances.

But WIBTA if I told her I didn't want her to?\n\nEdit: took your suggestions and spoke to her about it. She was very glad I brought it up because she could tell something was bothering me. I mentioned my feelings and didn't say anything about not getting it or even asking her to hold on, just mentioned my feelings and she said she was perfectly fine getting a different tattoo instead. She had no particular attachment to the moth just that she likes them.

INFO:\n* Is your wife aware of your feelings about this moth?\n* Is it just the moth design that's bothersome... or, the placement or just getting another tat in general?", "NAH.  I think there's two separate issues here - the tattoo itself, and planning to get an expensive piece without discussing it as a financial decision.\n\nFor the first one: it's very true that it's her body and she gets final choice, but if I got a tattoo my partner actively disliked / was going to be a bit freaked out about, I'd be pretty upset if they didn't tell me *before* I got it. Think of it as giving her all the information she needs to make an informed choice.\n\nFor the second one: it's reasonable to feel weird about finding out about big spends after they're decided, even if it's something you can both easily afford.  If your changed financial state means that the way you deal with these sorts of things as a couple has also changed, that's fine, but that's something that you need to discuss and decide together so that everyone's on the same page about how you handle your combined money.\n\nedit: changed my vote, I used 'n t a' mindlessly lol", "INFO: How did you think you should be included or asked about what permanent markings she should put on her own body? (at the same time that you are saying you're not expecting her to ask permission)", "NAH - I think it\u2019s fine for you to be honest about your feelings with her. Does she know about your deep dislike of death moths? If she did, it seems odd that she would choose something so specific to you having an intense dislike for. Of course it\u2019s her choice for her body, it just seems like a discussion might need to be had here so you can both be honest and open with each other.", "NAH. I like that you recognized it\u2019s an irrational thing and that you\u2019re trying to get help for it. Don\u2019t ask her to not get it. The therapy, once it does get going, will take care of this issue. Trust me.", "NAH. Yes, it's ultimately her choice. But, you sleep next to her. You make love to her.  Having a gigantic insect in the middle of her chest may be a mood killer. Y'all need to talk. Honestly and openly.  Maybe pick a beautiful butterfly instead of a death moth? Just a thought.", "You're more than allowed to tell her how you feel. She's your wife. You should be honest with her. What you shouldn't do is tell/ask/imply that she shouldn't get it.", "NTA. Definitely voice your opinion but know it\u2019s up to her", "So It's her call and you should respect that. So yta if you start demanding like your title suggests. But! Tell her your feelings about the tattoo, that you dislike them. That it might become a turn off, because if it ends up bothering you, at least she knew beforehand and could have decided for herself another design.", "YWBTA lightly but you wouldn\u2019t be the AH if you maybe asked her to wait and explained to her it\u2019s because you have an unnatural dislike of that type of moth, but are actively working on it.  Just make sure you actually work on it lol", "nta for expressing that you dont like the tattoo, however, ywbta if you pressed her on it and continued to harp on not liking it. if she wants the tattoo she can get the tattoo, everything else is an issue on your part. furthermore she does not have to include you into desicions on if and what kind of tattoos to get. so yta for saying you dont expect her to ask permission but then be butthurt about not being included or asked about the tattoo. makes it sound like you want her to ask you permission and you want have influence over what happens to her tattoos, you just dont want to say it.", "NTA, just have a reasonable talk with her, but if she gets it you just need to live with it. I must say, I'd unfortunately think of Buffalo Bill whenever I looked at it! Probably not the best thing to think of when looking at your wife!", "Ywbta. If you asked her not to do get a tattoo. \n\nYou get absolutely no say in what she is allowed to get or not. And you have tattoos. \n\nIf you actually loved her. It really wouldn't matter what she got. You'd still love her. A tattoo doesn't change her. \n\n\nBut ywnbta, if you talked with her about your thoughts on this. Do not say no she can't. Say I'm not a huge fan of this idea. What about this idea or this idea. And talk like adults.", "NAH. I\u2019d say talk to her and tell her how you feel :-) But definitely having an honest and open conversation is of upmost importance. Don\u2019t keep bringing it up or trying to sway her mind if she\u2019s very set on it. Perhaps looking into a different design could be a solution? Also ask her maybe why she wants the moth design and see what it means to her!", "NTA for having and expressing concerns *as long as* you can accept that she may be set on this regardless.\n\nI'm afraid I'm gonna get downvoted to hell here, but since a tattoo is what broke up my friend's marriage, here goes: My friend and their partner were both heavily tattooed on their arms, backs, and legs. So, no aversions there or the need for any body art to be of great significance. If they had the money and something they liked, they slapped it on their bodies. Until my friend went for a chest piece.\n\nIt's gorgeous work, but killed her partner's desire for her. They went the therapy route and tried other things I haven't been given the details on, but her partner just found the placement so unattractive that their physical relationship died. They went so far as to try an open relationship sexually while maintaining emotional intimacy, but that carried them about a year further.\n\n*If this could possibly affect your marriage in a detrimental way, I think you need to share that with your wife.* I suspect that could be viewed as a sneaky way to \"get\" what you want out of the situation, but after watching how her partner's revulsion chipped away at my friend's self-esteem and after seeing her partner try to self-medicate the guilt of no longer being attracted to her, I didn't feel right not sharing that. I'd never in my life considered that a tattoo could have such a ripple effect, and probably in most situations it doesn't.", "For expressing your opinion in a calm and reasoned way? NTA. Really depends how you play this though", "NAH - You seem to understand and respect your wife's autonomy.  But in marriage, you should consider your partner on some subjects.  If your wife isn't aware of your aversion to the moth you should discuss it with her, maybe you can come to an understanding regarding the tattoo that makes everyone happy.", "YWBTA if you ask her not to. You can share your opinion,  but requesting she not absolutely is a YTA move.", "YTA - her body her choice although I can understand the financial concern. She should pay for it herself", "NTA.\n\nAll of your concerns are genuine.", "Sorry, please clarify- death month or death moth? You switch in your post.", "NTA. You can tell her how you feel about it and have a respectful conversation and voice your concerns, but ultimately if she wants it she will get it and that's something you'll need to sort out in therapy.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhy would she need to ask you? This is your joint money, and you can easily afford it. It is YOUR body, not hers.", "When it comes to things that would affect us or our relationship, you have the right to object to such things. Ofc the decision is eventually hers alone but you can voice your issues with your partner's choices. \n\nIf you don't you might face more serious issues. Like avoiding being intimate because of a tattoo.\n\nNTAH.\n\nAlso I feel like you have some deeper issues. Like you are afraid to lose her. I dunno but I can feel there is more to this story. I hope you have a healthy and honest communication with your wife. You seem like a nice guy.", "NTA.  You have to look at the thing, so yes, you need to make your feelings known.

I have ASD too and have an aversion to purple. Well, she was getting a new living room set, and guess what colour she wanted it to be? So I sat her down and explained that just the THOUGHT of being in a room filled with that much purple made me *physically uncomfortable.* Even now, just thinking about it, makes me shudder. She went with royal blue instead. Personally I think she should've gone with red like her last one but she wanted a change. And as long as it's not purple, she could've honestly gone for neon fucking pink for all I cared. I mean, I would've teased her for it, of course, but I'd be able to visit without cringing.", "You'd be an AH if you actively asked her not to get it, but you wouldn't be if you said you had concerns you want her to hear, emphasizing that her decision still stands. You should also ask her if there's a significance behind the moth to her or if she just likes the aesthetic!", "NAH, definitely let her know how you feel about all of this. But don't try to manipulate her into not getting it if her mind is made up", "NAH\n\nCan your wife find some temporary tattoos of these designs to \"try before she buys?\" It seems like a good way to express herself artistically and not pay a ton of money.", "NAH to tell her your opinion.

Maybe the idea that someone would be that close to her chest which is a ridiculous and irrational thought that I recognize is very stupid.\n\nI don't like moths at all though which I don't know if I've ever brought up what with the bs 'men are strong and not afraid of things' mentality I was raised with.", "I just think it should be something we talk about before someone makes a decision. Like before I got mine I figured out what I wanted, where it would be and the symbolism and shared all of that first. I think part of my issue might also be that I just wasn't included in the decision? Again not to say she needs to ask permission but more that I would have just liked to be included in the decision.", "I honestly don't know if I've ever brought it up. But I also kind of feel like it's my issue and that's my problem so I shouldn't put it on her? Does that make sense?", "It often takes me writing out something like this to sort out my feelings about it.\n\nLike I said in another post I think the reason it bothers me a lot is just that we usually share and include the other in all of our decisions, but this one she didn't include me in it. Granted I do not like moths and don't find them pretty or anything but I think the biggest issue with me feeling like this is just that I wasn't included this time", "Oh fuck.

I also think that you can trust that she WON'T want to tattoo something on her body that you dislike. \n\nIf you do opt to say anything, don't make the convo just about your dislike for that type of moth or even about getting a tattoo... I would ask her what it represents to her and express that you certainly want to support her decisions and anything meaningful to her.", "OK, between this and other responses you've given, I've been able to put it together a little more for myself. \n\n\\*I think you should edit your post to include that your wife does not know about your aversion to the moth. I also think you should include what specifically you have listed as reasons you aren't feeling good about this tattoo, including your dislike of someone being that close to her chest. \n\n\\*You've really been very forthcoming with everyone, which is appreciated and helpful.\n\n\\*I'm glad you recognize that the location of her tattoo is ENTIRELY up to her. That's the only thing in this that I'm even leaning towards AH on, but you recognize that's a you thing, so I'm ok on it. As a reminder, tattoo artists see lots of bodies, and really just see it as a canvas. They are professionals. It's not a sexual thing for them, it's an art. This is their job, like it's her doctor's job to check whether parts of her body are healthy. \n\n\\*Please, please talk to your wife about how you feel about the moth. Let her know that you are working on it in therapy, and that you're not asking her not to get it, but maybe to just hold off until you can conquer this. She is definitely not going to want to do something that would be so distressing to you, especially knowing that you're not trying to control what she's doing with her body, you're just asking for some grace on the timing. \n\n\\*Knowing what meaning it holds for her might help in your therapy.\n\n\\*It's not a bad thing to want to know more about the why of a tattoo. Why a person chooses what they choose and why they choose the location are interesting things and meaningful conversation. You're not at all an AH for wanting to know these things.\n\n\\*Very gently, she really doesn't need to make you a part of the \\*decision\\* whether to get a tattoo. That's entirely up to her. She can ask for help in it if she wants, but it's a permanent mark on her body, not yours, so it's all up to her. She's told you about it after she's decided what she wants but before she GOT it, so you're at least a part of the entire process (which does include the financial feasibility and timing). It's not like she's come home and said \"ta da!\" I think that this is the most you have the right to expect. You can want more, but she's under no obligation to give more. \n\nAltogether, I'm giving an NAH. Wishing you both the best.", "so you're feeling upset that your wife didn't consult you with a choice about her body, so tell her that. just cuz you talked your tattoo over with her doesn't mean she is going to want to do the same.\n\nI'm not saying you're trying to be sexist, I'm just saying she's probably had a lot more people try to dictate how her body looks than you do have had in your own life, so maybe that's why she didn't think to do so. \n\nit seems like a lot of it is, as you said, irrational. you don't like the aesthetics of the tattoo. is the placement on the chest a big issue for you, too, in that it would be sexually unappealing? \n\nyou're gonna have to tell her that you're uncomfortable with this tattoo, but you're also gonna have to accept that she can do whatever she wants with her body.", "I think you should just talk it out with her but, if she choose to still get the tattoo after you tell her how you feel you should at least try to not hold it over her because you dislike it.", "It does make sense, but remember that you\u2019re a team. It is your issue, but it\u2019s not so heavy if someone you love is willing to help you carry it every now and then.\n\nI think by not telling her, you would be preventing her from making an informed choice. If she knew that this tattoo would actively distress you, chances are she might not want it anymore. And this wouldn\u2019t be due to you holding it over her head, she could just come to that conclusion on her own because she doesn\u2019t want to make you feel uncomfortable. Of course she may decide she still wants the tattoo and that\u2019s okay too, it\u2019s just important for you both to know each other\u2019s thoughts and feelings on this so you know where to go from here.", "I think this is something you really should talk to her about.  Not to be TMI, but do you think her getting a tattoo of an insect you have such a strong aversion towards might impact your ability to be intimate together?  As someone that's intensely arachnophobic, if my partner was considering getting a highly detailed tattoo of a spider on their body I would definitely inform them of my distress.  It *is* totally her decision at the end of the day, but a healthy relationship has a foundation of healthy communication; remaining silent now will probably result in problems later on.", "But this is about her body.
