I am both ADHD and dyslexia and could use something like this.  \n\nNTA by the way.", "NTA. She was rude and disrespectful. I would have called her out on it and given her a chance to apologize but it sounds like your friend is whipped so it wouldn\u2019t have mattered.", "NTA. She's not a kind person, OP, and I'm sorry she was rude to you.   \nDave isn't being a very good friend right now if he's going to allow his gf to treat you poorly in your own home.   \nYour other friends are correct; she was way out of line.", "NTA I've never been diagnosed with adhd but been told I should be assessed.\nI regularly don't get anything done despite not stopping all day.\n\nI'll give an example of what I'm like, I went into my sons room to sort his books out for a book swap at his school. Got into his room spotted his toy kitchen that hes out grown thought how his little sister would love it so moved it all to a different room, then realised some of her toys needed cleaning... by this point I've completely forgot about the books.\n\nA list where I have to mark them off would help me a lot. It in no way makes me a child or not grown up it's just the way my brain works. \n\nWell done for standing up for yourself, if Dave is truly a good friend he would think the same when hes had chance to calm down", "Def NTA, this gf was wayy out of line, and i think its a huge red flad to treat someone with some sort of a disability like that!", "YTA. Ah, the party house. I\u2019ve hung out in many over the years, but none recently. It seems that the use of your house is contingent on your guests only speaking to and about you only with some unpredictable level of reverence. I don\u2019t agree with her snap, able-ist, armchair psychologist assessment of you, but it was a little childish to blow up over such a minor slight. It seemed to hit a little too close to home, if you\u2019ll pardon the pun. Also, I think, and maybe you also think, that your \u201cfriends\u201d are using you for your house, and that that might be the real source of your anger, and you just took it out on her.", "NTA. Man she has some nerve. Every morning with breakfast I sit down and write a list of things I want to get done in the day. When you have a million things to do it helps to keep things focused or I'd just watch gilmore girls on repeat all day.", "I have a whiteboard on my fridge with a list of when the last time I did certain things like change the AC filter or the filter in the fish tank was.  I write myself notes everywhere because otherwise it gets forgotten.", "NTA  She makes a habit of insulting people who need reminders to do chores.", "I often forget what i wanted in the time the amazon app needs to open. Fortunately you always find something that you can buy and maybe it was what i forgot (haha, no, never).", "I'm going to Etsy to buy a board because it's fancier and I won't use it anyway...", "My dry erase board is on my fridge and it magically became invisible over time. Someone visited me last week and was like 'wow, you're really getting your Christmas shopping done early this year'. Uh, no. I just haven't updated it since Dec 2021 :(", "I used to have a nice dry erase calendar but it was one of the many things left behind when I had to gtfo a bad situation a few years ago. I hope it ripped the paint off his walls", "Annnnnd I've found my tribe. \u2764\ufe0f"]}
