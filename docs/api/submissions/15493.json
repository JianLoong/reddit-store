{"id": 15493, "submission_id": "12w6s63", "title": "AITA: Guilted onto a surprise family vacay with in-laws", "selftext": "So I just found out a couple days ago that my brother in law booked a large Airbnb several states away for the whole family next weekend. He didn\u2019t tell anyone, he just booked it and then told everyone, afterward. \n\nIt\u2019s supposedly a 4 hour drive away, but last time I went to that state I hit a lot of traffic, so I think it\u2019s going to be at least 5 minimum. They\u2019re going Thursday-Sunday. \n\nAnyway, I said I couldn\u2019t go because I had (photography) clients, which is partially true. I have clients Wednesday and Thursday, and the forecast has been tenuous, so I won\u2019t know until this week if I\u2019ll need to push my sessions forward or not toward the weekend.\n\nBrother in law was then guilting me to \u201cjust cancel and reschedule\u201d them. I\u2019m a higher-end photographer and my clients pay a pretty penny for my services \u2014 I\u2019m not going to just bail on them, they booked me months ago. This is literally my job.\n\nHusband was also guilting me, because he knows that if my sessions do stay where they are, I can technically just leave Thursday evening and still attend the vacation.\n\nAnd my whole thing is: When the hell did I volunteer to drive 4+ hours away? I didn\u2019t sign up for this. My BIL booking a really large expensive Airbnb without telling anyone is not my problem and I don\u2019t appreciate how both he and my husband are trying to make me feel bad about it, like I\u2019m the bad guy.\n\nThe irony is my husband himself is going out of guilt. I know that if his brother had told him ahead of time, my husband would\u2019ve asked him to book somewhere closer, because I know he doesn\u2019t actually want to do this vacation. But he\u2019s very easily guilted, and he told me himself he feels bad because his brother spent so much money on it.\n\nAnd I\u2019m just like\u2026 do you hear yourself? So idk, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m being that much of an asshole, but maybe I am. I just don\u2019t like being put into positions without my consent and then guilted to go along with it at my own inconvenience. And I don\u2019t like it happening to my husband either, his family does this to him all the time. Not vacations, I mean generally making him feel obligated to help with things.", "created_utc": 1682252594, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12w6s63/aita_guilted_onto_a_surprise_family_vacay_with/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

BIL booking the Airbnb, etc., without asking/consulting with anyone is ridiculous, and he  should expect that not everyone can drop everything when it works for him.  \n\nWhat does he do for a living? I mean, if the situation was reversed, would he walk away from professional obligations to answer to your whims?", "This is absurd. NTA of course.\n\nNot your fault he spent the money. He's an idiot, to do so without checking.\n\nIt's an invitation, not a military  draft or a court summons, so you can say \"thanks but no thanks\" without guilt.", "NTA. BIL is for doing it before telling you. Make a stand and refuse to go. You don't want him doing this again.", "NTA. Sounds like you and hubby need to put down some clear boundaries and just say \"no, can't make it\" a bit more. ETA don't say sorry, don't offer an excuse, if pressed just say prior commitment and more notice required. Just remember, it's an invitation not a summons.", "*Brother in law was then guilting me to \u201cjust cancel and reschedule\u201d them.*\n\nIt's your profession, your livelihood he's talking about in such a condescending manner.\n\nTell BIL to \"just cancel and reschedule\" this vacay. And while he does it, you can tell him to book it a bit closer to home.\n\nAs for your husband: *he told me himself he feels bad because his brother spent so much money on it.*\n\nThat was his brother's choice, not your husband's. So no need for him to feel responsible for the expense, nor guilty for his brother spending it. Also, BIL can always invite friends to come along instead of you.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThey are welcome to go without you.  No one else should spend your time (or money).\n\nUnderstand that anyone trying to guilt you may be doing so because they want you to do something for them.  For instance, your husband may want you to drive the car.  Your BIL may want you present to do some of the cooking and cleaning.  They can have a good time without you.  You aren't such a \"life of the party\" that your absence will diminish their fun.\n\nStay home.  If anyone is blowing up your phone during the weekend, set it to Do Not Disturb.", "NTA. BIL should have checked with you before booking if he didn't want exactly this to happen. Ideally he'd have given you more than 1-2 weeks' notice too.\n\nYour husband should be on your side: he married you, he didn't marry his brother.\n\nPerhaps BIL should \"just cancel and reschedule\" the Airbnb for a date further in advance. Doing that wouldn't risk harming his career, unlike if you were to \"just cancel and reschedule\" your clients as he suggests.\n\n>But he\u2019s very easily guilted, and he told me himself he feels bad because his brother spent so much money on it.\n\nWould he feel the same way if his brother were trying to get him to buy into a pyramid scheme?", "Sorry to hear about your husband\u2019s backbone removal procedure.

Your BIL is being disrespectful of your time and your profession. He is also very controlling by expecting everyone to drop everything to do what he wants.\n\nVacations are NOT something you surprise people with. They need to be planned in advance with everybody's input.", "NTA it\u2019s not yours or your husbands fault that his brother chose to spend on a lot of money on a vacation without consulting other people if they wanted/could go. So not let yourself be guilted into going and losing money.", "NTA. \n\nYour BIL and Husband both suck here. No adult should make commitments for other adults and paying for it as a form of leverage is toxic. Your BIL sucks but I also have a hard time believing your husband didn't have a little bit of knowledge that it was happening. Otherwise he would be irritated too.

Mid week surprise vacations are not a thing.", "Just don't go.", "NTA. Short term plans someone else makes for you are NOT mandatory, even if you DIDN'T have potential work clients. Anyway its your husband's family, not yours. If he wants to go fine. Stand your ground. Caving here sets a bad precedent. Let them enjoy the traffic.", "NTA. Don't let your husband or BIL guilt you into going. It's unprofessional to cancel on a client unless it is an emergency. Cancelling to go on a vacation that you don't want to be on makes no sense. If this really causes issuse with your husband than that means the issues were already there and going isn't going to fix it.", "You're never obliged to pay for something you didn't order or ask for. You're also not obliged to spend time and money or lose work and potentially clients either. \n\nYou should have been *invited* to the holiday prior to it being booked, not summoned and emotionally manipulated after the fact.\n\nI would die on this hill. Who put your BIL in charge of your lives, money and careers? If you let him get away with it this time, you're just telling him to keep on doing it.  \n\nNTA", "NTA. Guilt tripping is poor behaviour on your in-laws' part. Personally, I wouldn't go, you have to set boundaries with these people.", "NTA - completely unreasonable expectations.

I have to work is perfectly reasonable.", "NTA NTA NTA\n\nThese are probably the same family members that \"support\" your business by wanting sessions done on their terms. Are you going to be able to even enjoy this vacation or will you be editing photos during the weekend? It's not like your job stops at a photo session. It's also a physically demanding job and to expect you to just drive an extra 4 hours afterwards is irresponsible. The likelihood that you'll be tired is high. \n\nYour husband needs to learn to say no, but he also needs to learn that just because he can't say no doesn't mean he can make you say yes.", "NTA.   You would be the AH if you canceled or changed the dates for your clients.\n\nThese last minute expectations are totally unrealistic and are quite rude.   They are the AH for twisting it around and guilting you.", "NTA  You told him you couldn't come.  Don't go.  Don't let anyone guilt you into anything.  It sets a precedent you don't want to have set.  \n\nGood luck.", "NTA. BIL used the technique of \"I've booked this $$ airbnb & you need to be there!\" to FORCE you to go.\n\nThe *last minute booking*, the *expense,* and his *disregard for your plans* scream: Master Manipulator.

Thank you for sharing your anecdote. It\u2019s so frustrating and inconsiderate.
