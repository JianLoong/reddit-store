Toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap etc. \n\nSeveral weeks into the living situation, my roommate approached me to ask why there was toilet paper in the waste basket of the bathroom because she knew it wasn\u2019t her\u2019s. \n\nHonestly, I was kind of shocked at what I thought was an invasive and weird question but I answered that I had probably used it to blow my nose or remove some makeup. \n\nShe asked me why I did that instead of using tissues and I explained that I come from a frugal family and we tended not to spend extra money on things like Kleenex/Tissues when the the same basic product in another form, toilet paper, was available. In general we did not waste much and I have never been precious about little things like that. \n\nShe explained that she bought her own boxes of tissues for her room and told me that because we split the cost of the shared household items 50/50 I didn\u2019t have a right to use more of the toilet paper than her, and not to use it for anything except\u2026 wiping my ass. She insisted that I buy my own extra toilet paper or tissues, and figure it out and not to use \u201cour\u201d toilet paper for anything other than its intended purpose. \n\nI tried to push back and express that blowing my nose, or any other personal care application of the toilet paper, was a reasonable use of the product she was also entitled to. However, she really held the line and insisted I limit my toilet paper use and that she didn\u2019t consent to me using something she paid for and acted like it was rude of me to argue about it. \n\nI felt like a crazy person! Was I really an asshole when I used toilet paper for anything other than wiping my ass???\n\nFor those who may ask, we bought like a good deal 24 pack of toilet paper at a bulk store and never came close to running out, we both attended school on nearly full scholarships with generous stipends.", "created_utc": 1693824817, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/169owco/aita_for_using_toilet_paper_to_wipe_my_nose/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If I were you I'd keep using it and just flush it", "Your roommate has control issues, its going to get worse, move if you can.", "NTA what is she going to do? Count how many squares you use? She is being ridiculous.", "NTA. I suspect this could be the tip of the iceberg; goodness knows what she'll come up with next.", "NTA. The next time you need to wipe your nose, wipe it on her sleeve.", "NTA. She's a bit of a psycho and her reasoning is terrible. If you use toilet paper for your nose then she has more or all the tissue for herself, which is more expensive. If she really wanna be a bitch about it you pay your extra toilet paper for pennies and let her pay her damn tissues.", "NTA - it's paper either way, she just sounds controlling.", "NTA\n\nShe'll be checking how many sheets you use to wipe yourself soon and rationing it to X amount for every visit to the toilet.\n\nJust keep using it to wipe your nose but flush the evidence or get your own bin for your room because who knows what else she might see in the trash and object to.", "NTA. Wow. Just buy an extra pack of tp every once in a while. She's got odd boundaries (financial and tissue-related).", "NTA.  In the future, just make sure you flush the TP after you've used it for whatever.  \n\nAnd as someone in the paper industry, just a general reminder to never EVER flush any paper that isn't TP down the toilet.  \"Flushable wipes\" is generally a lie especially in older plumbing or a septic system.", "NTA. You're not a crazy person; you're LIVING with a crazy person.", "NTA. That's really invasive and pinches pennies to an almost obscene level. Can you move out?", "NTA!", "NTA.   Tell her to divide the pack - 12 rolls on one side of the toilet, 12 on the other.   She can choose which side she wants.   One of you only uses the left hand toilet rolls, the other only uses the right hand toilet rolls.\n\nYes, this is ridiculous.   It\u2019s your toilet paper.  You bought it.  You get to wipe any part of your body you choose with it.", "NTA. Has she got a chart on the bathroom wall to mark down how many times she uses the toilet and how many squares she uses each time? I mean, if she's gonna be a weirdo about your use of toilet paper, she may as well go all the way!", "Do a crap in the toilet and don\u2019t flush it. When she asks why say your saving the water to brush your teeth. Then u have leverage.  Lol", "NTA- how does she expect to actually measure that you both use an equal amount of toilet paper when using it (in her opinion) the \u201ccorrect\u201d way. Is she going to count every secure and measure out how much you can each use per bathroom trip? Are you going to be limited to an amount of poops/pees per day? What about guests? Are you to warn everyone who comes over that they\u2019re limited to two squares or they\u2019ll face the wrath of roommate? \n\nShe is ridiculous. Why don\u2019t you two just switch up who buys it after you run out? I mean she absolutely can\u2019t see reason the only thing I\u2019d suggest is just flushing your nose tp down the toilet.", "NTA\n\nIf she is so worried about the toilet paper maybe you both spilt the rolles in have and everybody has to use there one toilet paper. Maybe she has to go to the toilet more often than you and uses more toilet paper than you.", "NTA roommate is being weird bruh... i usually wipe (and blow) my nose with tp. it feels alot better on my nose that way.", "NTA. Keep using tp as you see fit, just flush it instead of putting it in the bin. And find a new roommate asap, this one is counting squares of toilet paper.", "NTA and a super weird thing to get precious about. What if she gets food poisoning one day and spends 48 hours using all the toilet paper on its 'intended purpose' but far more than you would without food poisoning.. she gonna foot the bill for extra rolls then?", "NTA OP.\n\nWhat kind of weird control freak goes snooping in a trashcan after you use the bathroom?  Then counts the amount of toilet paper you use?\n\nI suggest a lock on your room, and a new roommate asap.  If she'll go through your toilet paper usage, nothing is safe that you own.  There's no reason to think she won't go through your jewelry, your drawers, or your purse.  Or your bank statements, your bills, or your wallet.  This will not get better.", "NTA.  Using toilet paper instead of tissue is much better for the environment as it disintegrates, but I would flush it in the toilet instead of putting it in the trash. Regular kleenex tissue has chemicals to make it stronger and you should not flush it as it does not disintegrate in the same way.", "Do you really not see how this is abnormal? So this lady I met long ago when I was buying plastic wear for my kids. This was her argument. Do you not have dishes at home? I said yes! I told her it saves money on washing dishes and water use. You pay a water bill? Yes, our water bill is fixed so now you are making more waste to the environment. Just hand wash your dishes instead of the washer. AND you are spending and extra amount on tissues. Wtf? She is controlling\u2026move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have 4 kids, we are middle class, can afford Kleenex and TP, but most of the time my kids just grab a roll of TP to keep in their rooms for blowing their noses. We have Kleenex in the main rooms of the house. \nFunny story about flushing Kleenex, though. My great grandparents lived on a farm, very rural with an old septic system. Growing up, it was impressed upon me that kleenex DID NOT get flushed. In fact, at their house, they only flushed TP with poop on it. So young me (think under 10) apparently made the connection that it was the SNOT not the Kleenex that you weren't supposed to flush, and it wasn't until I was in high school and knew other people with septic systems that I realized that it was the Kleenex and not the snot.", "NTA. Her behaviour is odd. \n\nThis reminds me of my uni days. 2 of my housemates were super weird about stuff, so in the end the 3 of us who did get along used to go 3rds on a massive pack of loo rolls and keep them in our rooms. One of my other friends also bought his own and hid it, because his housemates didn\u2019t ever contribute and it got to a weird stalemate where they were using coffee filters rather than buy toilet paper. Toilet roll: argument as old as time.", "NTA. Same here. We blow our nose with whatever is nearby and usually we're out of Kleenex. We have seven damn people living in this house. My dad usually buys the TP. And HE doesn't even hyper-monitor the damn TP the way your stupid, fussy roommate is going on about.", "NTA. This is a bizarre and unstable thing to say to someone else - or frankly even think about! As a roommate I was often told I was controlling (I would get upset if the bathmat wasn\u2019t hung up after someone showered, and I wanted equality when it came to household chores, and I usually lived with gross boys so these were tall orders) but lol, reading this makes me feel like the most easy going person on earth. I agree with other comments that this isn\u2019t just a problematic thing for your roommate to do/say, but that it is very likely going to get worse than this. You should find somewhere else to live.", "i mean toilet paper in combination with some cleaner is perfect for displays and such. why would you be bothered by outside-of-ass-use cases?", "I don't blow my nose with toilet paper because you wipe, then grab another sheet. Not wiping nose with fecal fingered tissue", "I once went to one of those hole-in-the wall, grungy, but really good food local cuisine restaurants in Cairo, Egypt.  On God, they put a roll of tp right on the table in lieu of napkins. I wasn't mad. It's usually a bix of tissues, in most restaurants, but same thing, different shape.", "Give in to one thing, and then it will be another soon afterward. Who knows, maybe she wipes her ass a lot, and it evens out.", "Hand her $5 and tell her that's enough to cover roughly 4 rolls of tp out of the 24 pack. You won't even use that much for noses and faces, so now it's covered and she doesn't have to fuss.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all. Blimey, what a strange and overkill roommate you've inherited. Firstly, her doing an itemised check of the bin is weird. Secondly, you both buy the toilet paper so you are entitled to use your share however you wish to do so.\n\nYou didn't include your gender/biological sex, so I'm hoping she doesn't get all agitated if you have periods and use more toilet paper at that time of the month. As a woman with kidney and bladder issues, IBS, extremely heavy and long periods due to PCOS *and* sinus issues requiring usage of A LOT of toilet paper... if my husband complained that I use more toilet paper than he does and banned me from blowing my nose on it, I would be concerned.   If you are a menstruating woman... be careful that she doesn't force you to use contraceptives to avoid periods to lower the usage of toilet paper. She seems the type to do so.", "WTF? Toilet paper is what us poor folks use on both ends! NTA.", "Toilet paper seems to be one of those weird things that sets people off. \n\nAt university I suffered a nasty bout of campylobacter from a dodgy takeaway and got through a lot of TP (which I replaced) and was \"talked to\" by one of my housemates boyfriends, who wasn\u2019t on the lease btw, for using too much paper. I explained I\u2019d had food poisoning and his response was along the line of \"i get that, but we used a whole pack in three days. You need to use less.\"\n\nWhat did he want me to do? Wipe my arse on the bath towel he left permanently draped across the shower cubicle?", "No more comments needed. This is the correct answer with the correct solution.", "One sheet at a time by the sound of it!", "I had a landlady do this once. Every time I went to the bathroom she\u2019d check how much the loo roll had gone down. I started buying my own and keeping it in my bedroom. She was generally insane though.", "This is the answer.", "This is the answer. If she's going to be this way, keep the TP in your room and bring it out when you use it. I'd go out and buy a jumbo pack and NOT share it. It would stay in my room.", "This is a great answer", "Huh?", "for future reference, apply water till its clean, than you paper. you save on paper AND on ass redness, and it doesnt burn like the hells inner circle"]}
