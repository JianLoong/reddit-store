I have 4 kids, we are middle class, can afford Kleenex and TP, but most of the time my kids just grab a roll of TP to keep in their rooms for blowing their noses. We have Kleenex in the main rooms of the house. \nFunny story about flushing Kleenex, though. My great grandparents lived on a farm, very rural with an old septic system. Growing up, it was impressed upon me that kleenex DID NOT get flushed. In fact, at their house, they only flushed TP with poop on it. So young me (think under 10) apparently made the connection that it was the SNOT not the Kleenex that you weren't supposed to flush, and it wasn't until I was in high school and knew other people with septic systems that I realized that it was the Kleenex and not the snot.", "NTA.

As a woman with kidney and bladder issues, IBS, extremely heavy and long periods due to PCOS *and* sinus issues requiring usage of A LOT of toilet paper... if my husband complained that I use more toilet paper than he does and banned me from blowing my nose on it, I would be concerned.   If you are a menstruating woman... be careful that she doesn't force you to use contraceptives to avoid periods to lower the usage of toilet paper. She seems the type to do so.", "WTF?

If she wants to buy tissues for her nose from her own budget and not the joint budget, then the fair thing for you to do would be to also buy your nose-wiping supplies from your own budget.

My mother did that and flushed, which eventually did cause a clog.", "Not really. TP breaks up immediately into tiny pieces when flushed whereas paper towels and tissues mostly stay whole. You have to flush a big wad of toilet paper at one time for it to ever clog the toilet or your pipes. Wipes, paper towels, tampons, pads and other paper items are the things you need to worry about since they don't break up when flushed and can get trapped in the pipes much more easily and cause a major clog.", "It's asking for a sore/itchy bum - overzealous wiping can damage the skin in that area and make it more prone to infection etc", "Poor poopy kitten! Poor Tylikcat!  I'm at the other end--so to speak. I have an elderly dog with hip issues and GI issues, partially from the meds he takes for his arthritis. So I spend a lot of time wiping & cleaning his butt. I need to shave the entire area, as he's a long haired dog. (I trimmed it with scissors but it's not the same.)", "Nah, she blows her nose constantly when she goes in the bathroom. She doesn\u2019t need to. Just does. Literally never does it outside the bathroom and is fine when she doesn\u2019t go to the bathroom. But once she\u2019s in there, it is constant.", ">You have to flush a big wad of toilet paper at one time\n\nExactly what u/oorwayba 's mother in law did.", "You don't know my plumbing, buddy", "Not all toilet paper breaks up like that.  We toured Alcosan processing plant and they absolutely had full pieces of toilet paper they have to strain out when processing waste water.  Toilet wipes actually cause alot of clogged pipes that they call a fat burger I believe.  I have cousins who are plumbers.  TMI I know but interesting none the less.", "We don't know that. All we know is she goes through a lot of it. She could have intestinal issues that cause her to go constantly throughout the day. She also could be blowing her nose and tossing it in the trash can.", "I didn't see any mention of the toilets being constantly clogged when MIL is in town, so chances are slim that she's flushing huge wads. And as long as she's not doing that, she's not damaging anything.", "I'm sorry you have crappy plumbing. I've traveled in many countries where the plumbing couldn't handle flushing any TP or else the pipes would clog so they always had a trash bin next to the toilet. In places with more modern plumbing, toilet paper should never be an issue unless you use more than half a roll at one time. \n\nIf your plumbing constantly clogs, you might have tree roots in the sewer line or just old cast iron pipes that are super rusty on the inside and have a much smaller inside diameter than they should. Can't guarantee that's the issue, but it is something I see almost daily in my job.", "I work in plumbing/HVAC, and you are correct. Some of the thicker, fancier toilet paper doesn't break apart as well, but it usually still breaks up far more than other paper products. Septic-safe toilet paper is always best for avoiding clogs as it almost completely breaks down when flushed.\n\nToilet wipes, makeup wipes, baby wipes, etc. are definitely the biggest issue since companies market them as \"flushable.\" Flushable only means that they will go down the toilet, but any type of wipe won't ever break down when flushed and can easily clog things up. Also, the term you're looking for is \"fatberg\" not fat burger, and those things are absolutely disgusting.\n\nETA: Fatberg like iceberg instead it's just a massive clump of fat, grease, paper products and other solid waste.", "She has issues but she goes like once a week or less. And the TP is not going into the trash. Only option is flushing."]}
