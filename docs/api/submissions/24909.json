Long story short, back in November \u201822 I (34F) found out I had massive infertility issues, with a less than 5% chance of getting pregnant without using a donor egg. Through a miraculous specialist and months of going through hell with treatments, I am 11 weeks pregnant. However, several months ago, before getting pregnant, my husband (35M) told his sister (44F) that we were going through fertility issues and struggling. His siblings are all much older than us, and they\u2019re all very close (48M, 46F, 44F) - we are sort of the odd ones out being so much younger and in a different phase of life. They all have kids around the same age, go on vacation together, and see each other all the time. We get along fine with them, but I would describe our relationship to them more as cousins rather than siblings. \n\nNot only did his sister never follow up with us checking in, we found out from my FIL that she told all the other members of the family about  (we hadn\u2019t told anyone else yet except my FIL). While I\u2019m sort of hurt my SIL didn\u2019t check in to see how I\u2019m doing, I\u2019ve moved past that. To be completely fair, I likely wouldn\u2019t have checked in with her if I found out about an issue she was having, especially if I didn\u2019t find out directly from her. What I can\u2019t move past is A. She didn\u2019t check in with my husband, and B. SHE TOLD THE REST OF THE FAMILY. \n\nThere\u2019s another layer to this, my wonderful MIL tragically passed away almost two years ago, which left the whole family distraught, especially my husband. I know it was so difficult on him to go through the pain of infertility, as well as now the joys of pregnancy, without his mom. Part of me feels like his sisters (who had their mom through their own pregnancies, miscarriages, raising their kids to teenagers, etc) could have stepped up a bit to at least support my husband. \n\nI brought up to my husband how I was hurt that she never followed up, and that she told everyone our business that wasn\u2019t hers to tell.  He got upset (not at me, just the situation) and started taking the blame, saying he \u201ccould have told her in a better way\u201d He told her while they were almost at the end of a 5K walk, and felt he didn\u2019t give her many details. I\u2019m not sure what that that has to do with it, but I honestly dropped the subject because he\u2019s been though enough and I\u2019m not trying to put any more stress on him. \n\nI haven\u2019t refused to see his family or anything due to this, two weeks ago we told them I was pregnant and they were happy for us. \n\nAITA? I\u2019m really not that close to my in-laws, more so just cordial with them, so maybe I\u2019m being overly sensitive and unreasonable getting so hung up on this?\n\nEdit: I can\u2019t change the title of the post, but upon further reflection I\u2019m asking if I\u2019m TA for bringing it up to my husband, not for having feelings about a situation.\n\nI also realize the part about wishing they could have stepped up sounds very entitled. I do want to make it clear that I did not bring that part up to anyone else, including my husband, and I never would.

When they don\u2019t do that, it hurts. Sometimes we assume things that aren\u2019t intentional or accurate. It\u2019s not okay that his sister has a big mouth though. Also, congratulations! NAH", "NAH. I don\u2019t see that anyone\u2019s being an asshole here, but there are hurt feelings and you might benefit from reaching out to her and admitting you were hurt by her telling others such personal details. Hopefully you can clear the air and move forward in a better place.\n\nCongrats on your pregnancy!", "NTA. The checking piece is N A H because it can be hard to know what is best in that situation. But sharing this info widely was AH move on her part.", "NTA.  Primarily because she never should have shared that information with anyone else.  It wasn\u2019t her story to tell.  You have a right to be upset by this.  \n\nAll things being equal, siblings should be able to confide in each other without worrying about that confidence becoming fodder for the family gossip mill.  Throughout my life, my brothers have individually confided things to me.  My other brothers would sometimes figure out I knew something, but they always accepted my response that it wasn\u2019t my place to say.\n\nMy son and daughter confide in each other, including my son and DILs struggles getting pregnant.  My daughter never told me about this\u2026it was our son who revealed it to us after his wife became pregnant and shortly before their son\u2019s birth.  They trust each other to keep the shared confidences.  \n\nIt\u2019s ok that you expressed your feelings to your husband.  You should be able to talk with him about the things that are troubling you.  That doesn\u2019t mean you want him to actually do anything about it\u2026other than maybe not confiding stuff you\u2019re not ready to share.", "Thanks. Yeah I genuinely have made my peace with her not reaching out, even if it doesn\u2019t seem like it from my post haha. I am still sad that I don\u2019t have the type of relationship with my sibling in laws where they do feel like they could reach out, especially since I\u2019m not overly close with my own sibling either. But that\u2019s no one\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just the situation. Her telling the rest of the family is what I\u2019m still struggling with.", "It did feel like gossip imo. I saw another commenter here say it\u2019s possible she shared the info to make sure they\u2019re sensitive to my situation (aka so they don\u2019t say \u201cwhen are you finally popping out babies disgruntledinfertile?!) I suppose that\u2019s always possible as well, but it still felt icky and gossipy to me.", "Thank you, I do get that it\u2019s hard to know what to say when someone is going through something, but it totally just felt like gossip line she knew how to pick up the phone for every other family member but us. I also feel really unsupported in other areas of life (infertility and non-infertility related) so I know that contributed to some of my feelings as well", "Nah, choosing to spread private medical information without asking if it is ok makes the SIL the TA even more because her first instinct was to gossip/show off that she had privledged info rather than think about someone else and how they might be doing in light of the situation", "I get the entitlement part, that part is totally fair. I know I\u2019m being selfish on that one, as I specified in the post it\u2019s more that I wish my husband had that type of maternal-like support. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m in the right, just wish things were different. But that one is what it is, I know we\u2019re not entitled to any support, I do feel like that part came off badly, it just adds to my emotions about her telling the rest of the family my business.", "It doesn\u2019t affect sil. You dont share someone else medical information.", "I absolutely could have followed up with her. I agree with that one. I don\u2019t agree that she should have obviously told the rest of the family, especially without running it past us first.", "It is awkward and difficult to know what to do, I definitely hear you and agree with you there. I appreciate the perspective that perhaps she told them to make sure they\u2019re sensitive to the situation. I still don\u2019t agree with her choice to do that, but I didn\u2019t think of that perspective and it\u2019s good to consider it from a place that\u2019s not just gossip-based.\n\nI did tell my husband it was ok to tell her. Fair point though that my FIL also contributed by making it known she told everyone.", "Totally fair, I think it\u2019s confusing because I\u2019m still a little confused. I actually don\u2019t want/expect anything from her at this point. I more so just feel bad/like I\u2019m TA for mentioning all of this to my husband in the first place.", "Yeah, that\u2019s hard. I\u2019m close with my siblings and SIL but after my miscarriage I didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so my husband let them know what was going on and asked them to leave me alone until I reached out. It\u2019s hard to know what people want when they are struggling. \n\nAs for the telling, that\u2019s your personal medical information. If your husband wants to be able to rely on his siblings for support, then they need to show that they can respect your privacy.", "But the husband shared it with his sister with her permission. She might have assumed she had the okay to talk about it. Did he say it was confidential?", "I didn't say she should have, only that she obviously would. You are her brother's wife. You have infertility issues, which affects your ability to have children. This is something that will be shared among family members, likely her friends as well. People talk about stuff like this. If you didn't want it shared, you should have specified that or not shared it with her.", "Let the dust settle. Time can be a healer. \n\nAlso no offence to husbands, but they\u2019re not always the best at relaying information, I bet if you spoke to them you\u2019d realise it was all a big misunderstanding! \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with them, but remember they\u2019d have never had that info without your husband telling them!  \n\nThis forum is to get different perspectives.", "I think you\u2019re justified in feeling annoyed at her for sharing your struggles if your husband told her keep it to yourself and if you\u2019re concerned about your husband not having a mom to support him in the pregnancy maybe his dad could like who better to give advice/support about being a new dad than a seasoned one\n\nAlso congratulations on the baby wishing you the best on your journey to motherhood", "Yes, I definitely won\u2019t be giving my stamp of approval again for my husband to rely on any of his siblings for support regarding my personal medical info, lesson learned on that one lol. They\u2019re not trustworthy.", "The idea that you would assume that you could share this information, when told 1:1, is wild to me. \n\nThis is the type of information you should assume if confidential unless told otherwise.", "Wow the people you know must not have anything else to do if they are gossiping about people fertility.", "That\u2019s fair. Just to clarify I\u2019m not the one that shared it with her, my husband did, however I told him I was ok with him sharing it with her when he asked so that part is on me. I should have told him to specify to keep it on the DL. But I appreciate the perspective, you\u2019re right that people talk, I just had feelings about it.", "I don\u2019t disagree that husbands aren\u2019t the best at relaying information, I love my husband to death but I\u2019m sure the info wasn\u2019t relayed in the best possible way either, haha.", "We had to add a few people to that list. It only makes a hard situation harder. Good luck with your pregnancy!!", "Unless the he thought it was a touchy subject but wanted to inform the family through his siblings. Their whole relationship dynamic is very weird to me from OP describes, esp the parts about 1) the husband worrying how he told sis - which reads like he might not have been clear with his intention of sharing the info and 2) OP expecting the sisters to be maternal to hus ? Honestly it\u2019s odd", "Can I just add even if they were all negative intentionally which I don\u2019t think is the case, do not let it take away from you and your husbands blessing, nothing can take away from that! \ud83e\udd70", "Thank you!", "But if the husband wanted to do that, why didn\u2019t he tell her he gave his sister permission to share when she brought it up? \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I always assume that something I am told in a 1:1 conversation is private, unless I am told or shown otherwise. Especially something as personal as infertility.", "I genuinely don\u2019t think there were negative intentions either, just more so that I\u2019m the afterthought in my own story, so to speak! \n\nAnd thank you! It really is a miracle and a blessing that I\u2019ve made it this far in the pregnancy.", "Well then he would be the asshole then and op would be blaming him and not her. I\u2019m not making assumptions, but this wouldn\u2019t be the oddest scenario", "Like I said maybe you were discussed as to be aware of being sensitive, which is being caring, you\u2019re only 11 weeks, I bet when you get your scan soon, everyone will be elated, and thrilled to celebrate. \n\nI really don\u2019t think you\u2019re the afterthought, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the odd ones out, as someone in their 40s we get no filter and are no nonsense.", "NAH. If I was SIL, I don't think I would have reached out, either. I would not have told the family, though. It sounds like SIL is very close with her sisters, so it isn't a huge surprise she told them, especially if husband didn't ask her to not tell anyone. News like that usually circulates within a family.\n\nYour idea that husband's sisters should step up to help your husband since his mom isn't there to help him like she was for his sisters is... strange to me. Your husband isn't the one who is pregnant. Even if his mom was alive, she wouldn't be helping him like she helped her daughters. They were pregnant; he isn't.", "NTA but you are grieving the loss of the relationship you WISH you had with them and you wish your husband could experience with them. Normal! Congrats to you and may you find found family in wonderful friends with kids the same age as yours in lieu of the family scenario!"]}
