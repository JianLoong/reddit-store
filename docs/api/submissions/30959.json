Recently, she started teething, as her molars have started to come in. First, it was the top ones for about a week, then we had a week\u2019s break, and now the bottom ones are coming in. It\u2019s clearly causing my daughter a lot of pain, especially at night. Before she was a good sleeper, but now it\u2019s been rough. She\u2019s been waking up around 1am and then 3am daily, screaming with her little fingers in her mouth. My wife and I have tried comforting her, bringing her in our bed (she sleeps in our room anyway and her crib is next to our bed, but normally she likes to sleep cuddled up when she\u2019s uncomfortable), we\u2019ve even given her baby Motrin to help with the pain but she still screams for about 10-20 minutes each time until we are able to settle her. It\u2019s shrill and it sucks, but there\u2019s not much we can do beyond what we are already doing. \n\nWe live on the ground floor of a new condo building. It\u2019s made of heavy concrete and decently sound proofed, but not perfect. Above us lives a single woman in her late 20s / early 30s. This is an expensive part of town in a new building, so we can assume shes decently monied. She also keeps her balcony door open all day and night that faces into our courtyard. She has been \u201cpunishing\u201d us during the day by blasting loud music directly into our unit by putting a stereo next to her balcony. We are on the ground floor and have a fully enclosed courtyard so it vibrates around. She\u2019s got great music taste, and my daughter will dance to it all day long. So while my wife hates her intention, I think it\u2019s worked out just fine\u2026 until now\u2026 \n\nLast night she came barging down at 3am and rang our bell 4 times while we were trying to settle our daughter. Motrin works for about 8 hours, so by 3am we have to give her another dose and wait through the cries, cradling her for 15-20 minutes for it to kick in again. My wife (a strong tempered petite woman, amplified by her first year of motherhood) wanted to go fight her then and there, but I said let\u2019s just concentrate on settling the baby and ignore her.

AITA?\n\nUPDATE: I delivered a small care package to her door with a long letter and a bottle of wine and chocolates. She was not home so I put it next to the door. We are only here for a couple months (temp rental until we finish construction) but I\u2019d rather offer an olive branch than see all the pettiness continue. Yes, it sucks to be woken up. Yes, it\u2019s a shared building. Yes, people throw parties here until 3am on the weekends. Yes, babies cry and we try our best. For those who live in very big cities\u2014 mine has 22 million\u2014 this is what you experience. I\u2019m listening to loud mariachi music from the neighbour across the way right now.

Why wait until the poor thing is hurting?????\n\nEdit- yta regardless of all the added info. What you're doing clearly isn't working. You chose to have a baby. Your neighbor didn't. Waking her up every night at 3am is a problem and the solution can't be 'she can deal with it!'", "ESH. You comments about her are awful (especially that \"daddy\" is paying her way.) Her response with the loud music is childish.\n\nIs there some reason why you can't move the doses of Motrin so that it works all night? Maybe a dose at 11:00 pm? That would allow all of you to get a much needed night's sleep. Also, I think they make cold teething rings to help with pain. \n\nTry harder...for you, your child, and you neighbor.", "ESH - but you suck more. Your neighbour sucks for how she seems to have handled the problem. IF her music is directed at you, then she\u2019s taking the passive aggressive route and that\u2019s petty. However I can understand why she\u2019s so upset. She doesn\u2019t have children, and likely needs to rest before work like most other people in existence. If her sleep if being affected every night, I\u2019d be butthurt too. \n\nThat being said, you are a bigger AH. Firstly for not staying ahead of your child\u2019s pain. If this is a developmental phase she\u2019s been going through for some time now, you should be giving her pain meds before she gets to a level that continues to bother your neighborhood. Secondly you\u2019re an AH for your daddy\u2019s money comment. If it takes sooooo much money to live in the building, so much so that a single woman could not possibly be able to afford it on her own without daddy\u2019s help, maybe you and your wife should think about moving. You know, since you\u2019re so well off and can afford such an expensive apartment. It sounds like you can afford to not be an AH, you just don\u2019t want to because you\u2019ve made the choice to have a kid and now everyone must suffer along with you and your horrible wife. Wanting to throw down with the neighbour because YOUR screaming child is disrupting her sleep is pure trash behaviour. Do better, you\u2019re raising a child.", "You say she has been punishing you with stereo placement. How do you know it's a conscious effort to punish and not someone simply not realising what they are doing bothers you? Have you talked about it with her? Have you explained what the situation with the baby is? \n\nAlso how can one settle a baby to sleep when someone is signing the doorbell constantly?\n\nSomething doesn't feel quite like you've told everything related.", "Missed the \"daddy\" comment, but you sound like a dick if you posted it then sneakily deleted it because it made you look bad.", "So multiple weeks worth of a screaming toddler at 3am and you think your neighbor is an A H because she rang your doorbell at 3am, right. \n\nYTA and please do something about pain management for that poor kid.", "ESH she could be more understanding and the stereo thing is stupid and childish. \n\nBut as a person without kids, why should she be awakened because your child is teething? It is not her fault? But you seem to have no sympathy for her position. You even go so low as to suggest her apartment is paid for by her daddy instead of her, which seems like a low grade passive aggressive insult. \n\nI am not suggesting that you should somehow force your child to stop crying nor am I suggesting that you are doing anything wrong. Teething is a normal part of child development. But that does mean your choice to have a child should infringe on other people's choice to get a good night sleep. \n\nWhy not go knock on her door and apologize for the night time crying? In fact, I would knock on all your neighbor's doors and apologize. Your unit started this, so take responsibility for it.", "YTA. The \"or daddy does\" bit that you conveniently edited out, oh my.", "You need a better doctor. Motrin can be given every six hours and can be alternated with Tylenol for more pain control in shorter intervals.\n\nYou said your doctor is old school.  So like find a new doctor", "The more I read the less I liked you so honestly I really struggled to even give this ESH. \n\nYour  neighbor is selfish because she doesn't want to interrupted in the middle of the night? \n\nWhy are you waiting for your daughter to be in pain? Stay ahead of it.\n\nWhat does your or your neighbor's financial status have to do with anything?\n\nMaybe she's blasting her music to help her stay awake?", "Why aren\u2019t you buying soundproofing things? There are soundproofing curtains and panels you can use.", "I can understand the woman as nobody gets any sleep when your daughter is crying. She is working everyday and it is hard to work while you didn't sleep properly for many days or weeks. I am alone, childless, living in an apartment I paid for. I would be angry too if you would be my neighbor.", "ESH\n\nAll of you need to grow up and you and your wife need to find another solution (maybe without thinking fighting will help) besides motrin if it's not working to the point that your baby is crying at 1am then 3 am. \n\nNo one wants to hear a crying baby at 3am.\n\nWith that being said, she could be more understanding but with you saying that she's using \"daddy's money\" to live in her apartment seems like you don't understand that women can be successful without having to worry about kids.", "YTA\ntext about your neighbour is just lame and shows what person you are. Judgmental prick.\nShe has right to sleep at night. It is your child and your responsibility.\nI can bet that if your neighbor had a dog that barked at night, you would make a fuss about it. Because she can't handle it and you and your wife are sooo tired and can't sleep. This is the same. You decided to have a kid, why your neighbor is suffering the consequences? Your child - your sleepless nights, not hers. And you should do everything to not be a nuisance for others, especially at night.", "YTA- you basically admit that you could give baby pain medication before bed but you choose not to? Why wait for her to be so uncomfortable she is shrilling?  To me you\u2019re not doing enough to control her discomfort. \n\nWho cares how your neighbor pays for her place, you still need to abide to quiet hours. She should start reporting and filing noise complaints. Especially, since y\u2019all don\u2019t want to talk about it and fix it.", "Have you tried teething toys? They have these silicon straws that you can put in the freezer, and then give to your baby. Wonderfully numbing if you\u2019re waiting for a new dose to kick in", "Mum of 3 here, you can most certainly move a dose to before bedtime or like 11pm/12am (we had to give a bottle at that time so we did it then) and it helped our bubs-if they woke up during night, gave frozen teether, alternated every 4 hrs w/tylenol (eg motrin then 4 hrs later tylenol, motrin 4 hrs after that etc) maybe write a letter to her explaining what\u2019s going on and leave it on her door.", "YTA. Your baby should not become other people's problems.", "YTA - your poor child.  Do you really think there's not much else you can do?  Have you even talked to your pediatrician?  Is your child allergic to Tylenol?  If not, why aren't you alternating Tylenol and Motrin so she always has pain and inflammation coverage, with no gap?  What does the pediatrician say about using small amounts of topical pain gels?   Have you given her frozen teething rings, washcloths, or bananas? Are you massaging her gums?  Stop worrying about your neighbor and take care of your kid.", "Hey everyone: stop giving unsolicited medical advice that directly goes against what the OPs doctor has said to do. That\u2019s not what anyone was here for.", "YTA. Reverse the situation, you don\u2019t have a baby and hers wakes you up twice a night screaming.  How long could you put up with it?", "YTA: if your daughter is routinely waking people up at a \u201cdecently soundproofed\u201d condo at 3am, YTA. There\u2019s got to be other measure you could use to keep the noise to a minimum.", "ESH she shouldnt be surprised but also not saying you should force your baby to shush but be understanding usually people just apologized like \"hey we know our baby is loud were sorry she/he is teething\" its also normal for someone without a child to be reasonably irritated to be woken to screaming for 15-20 minutes every night yes you should expect noise but noise shouldnt disrupt your sleep every night how thin are the walls that your baby is screaming so loud? I've teethed several children 3 siblings and 3 nieces and nephews yes they scream but not loud enough to hear on another floor unless walls are paper thin but as you said that isnt the case your baby is LOUD in a very well built building take your kid to a doctor, also belittling her cause shes also stressed from your baby WAKING HER ALSO sucks no she shouldnt act childish and angry niether should your wife wanting to fight her and you saying \"daddies money\"  ESH except the baby cause hell its a baby", "ESH but you more, especially for your condescending attitude toward your neighbor.  You could mitigate the situation by adding some sound-dampening elements to the room where baby sleeps and perhaps waking her at some point to give more medicine *before* she is screaming, but it seems as though you actually want to let her scream just to get back at your neighbor.", "YTA it\u2019s 3am I wouldn\u2019t wanna hear your fuckin kid screaming either", "Wow these comments are ridiculous and it\u2019s redditors ata. Babies cry. Sometimes in the middle of the night. Sometimes for hours. You should not be medicating your child on behalf of your neighbors. People who don\u2019t want to hear the natural noise of other humans should not live in apartment buildings.", "You absolutely can adjust your daughter's pain medication you just don't want to  (out of spite perhaps?).

Set an alarm to wake up and shoot liquid Motrin into babies mouth while she sleeps. If she does wake up she needs more intervention that just meds and hugs. Where is her cold/frozen washcloth/wood beads/silicone teething mitten to chew on??", "Set an alarm for 2:30 and dose her before the pain starts. This could keep everyone happy until her little teeth pop out", "YTA. In a condo, it is YOUR responsibility to not allow your noise to invade others' spaces. If you can't do that, you should live somewhere else. And before you or anyone says that someone that likes quiet should live somewhere else - no. Your noise does NOT get to invade someone else's dwelling. That's all there is to it. And she also should follow that but she's retaliating and you deserve it. She's trying to fight fire with fire, and she is 100% justified in doing so. You need to give your child pain meds BEFORE the prior dose wears off. People with children do NOT get to force them on other people and that is what you are doing. Stop it.", "YTA You have to answer the door bell.

Babies teethe.  It\u2019s normal and everyone has to just do the best they can.  The lady upstairs needs to get a grip.   She knows what it is, she knows it\u2019s normal, healthy, etc. and has to adjust to communal living.", "No! NTA  \nBabies cry. You are doing your best. Your neighbor has weird expectations. Does she thing babies come with a volume dial? an off switch? has she never heard of sound canceling headphones? \n\nHm. If you are inclined and able, maybe send her a gift of nice noise canceling headphones. She's an AH but maybe she can be muted with kindness. I am annoyed with her on your behalf.", "Try baby ambasol, ice pops, ice cream and other numbing agents. Being kept awake all night has got to be awful for your neighbors, but I don't see what a conversation about it would do.

I also have children living a floor above me that scream and everything, I ignore it. Also, realize and understand that this seems to be OP\u2019s first kid so he and his wife are trying to navigate parenthood from the beginning.

That allows everyone to sleep. \n\nShe\u2019s well within her rights to play music during the day, and tbh, I can\u2019t say i blame her\u2026 \n\nIt\u2019s obviously not your babies fault, because she\u2019s in pain and doesn\u2019t understand, but you do understand.

With that knowledge as a neighbour I\u2019d be furious. \n\nEveryone has the right to be able to sleep in their own home at night.", "ESH, but you kind sir really suck for the mere comment of her living there probably because her daddy has money. WTF does that have to do with your wailing ass kid at 3 am in the morning??? Like others have said, get ahead of her pain to avoid being disruptive to someone\u2019s sleep late at night. Your wife wanting to fight??? HA! That building can\u2019t be as solidly built as you claim it is if you can hear a child crying through the walls all night long. You also said that she\u2019s loud because your neighbor called her a little terrorist which leads me to believe you just let her holler all loud and shit throughout the day while she\u2019s playing which again is just as disruptive. That\u2019s probably why she blast her music throughout the day. I think it\u2019s safe to say YTA and not ESH.", "YTA\n\nThere is no reason you cannot time the motrin so that it doesn't run out at 3AM That is on you for putting her to sleep so early.

Repeatedly waking other people up at 3AM is pure AH.", "YTA purely for ignoring her. You have to find a way to co-exist, refusing to engage with her was childish in the extreme.\n\nYeah, you can't do much about your kid screaming, but it's also not unreasonable to not want to be woken up before work by someone's kid screaming.\n\nYou could have opened the door and said \"I'm really sorry, she's teething but she should be settled soon\", but you went with the same maturity level as your daughter.", "YTA and so is your wife. Who tf things abt a physical altercation with their neighbors ever? Also you can\u2019t time the doses of Motrin better so the baby isn\u2019t up at 3am?

YTA and NTA.  anyone that lives in an apartment knows sound is always an issue.  however should your sqwalling kid be visited onto others trying to rest? But then,  its a baby, its what they do.   Many years ago i lived in an apartment when my son was about that age.

Alternating can be a bit help (I had to do that when I had a nasty fever - I was 18, but at home, so my parents had to wake me up every 2 hours to alternate - they probably thought they were past that, but at least I could swallow pills and didn't start screaming!)", "The majority of this sub are *children*", "Often virulently so.", "Often virulently so.", "Soundproofing panels aren\u2019t really a real thing.

One, she may not go back to sleep, and two, giving pain meds repeatedly when not needed makes their efficacy much lower! People are idiots", "Wtf baby Shelly, you were scheduled to scream in pain at 3:15. It\u2019s only 2:40 cut that shit out!!!", "Not to mention that babies crying is designed to like incapacitate adults brains so they care for their kids to make it stop and the sound has the ability to pierce most objects.", "Lots of people apparently  don\u2019t understand that", "It\u2019s funny how people who have been in the presence of babies think it\u2019s the same as knowing how to care for one 24:7.", "Not only is this wrong it\u2019s dangerous.

I'm busier than most (after work stuff is my decision, but I have very little downtime. And it's all substance abuse recovery stuff, not social activities) so I need to be able to sleep at night. I'd be furious if a neighbor was keeping me up.", "I don't have kids, but one day a baby was screaming in the grocery store louder than any other baby I've ever heard.  I just went about my business - the mother was *trying* to soothe her, and since her baby was screaming directly in her ear, I didn't think that she needed me to point out that she was loud.", "And most the posts from the point of view of the angry neighbor are \"You live in a shared housing- if you want privacy live in single family home, not an apartment complex\" Which of course sucks for many reasons but it gets the main point across of- there are things you just have to accept when living in apartments. It sucks all around. Yes, OP can likely change the timing so that the bulk of sleeping hours is teething screaming free BUT at the end of the day with babies it just can't be controlled short of some sort of abuse.", "Clearly a lot of folks in here without kids who are gonna be in for a wild ride when they have them.", "Also what if (I know this is crazy but) she closes the balcony door? I've lived with a balcony, I use to leave it open all he time too, but when things woke me up I didn't blame the things I blamed myself for not closing the f*cking door!", "Right? Babies will cry and parents will do everything they can for the wee mite. I would hope everyone is keeping their doors and windows shut at night, too.", "THIS! Also, it's cute and all to say \"don't wait to give your baby medicine\", but let's be real. The recommended dosage and frequency for a baby or a kid often isn't enough to soothe them until the next safe dose. What kind of parent would give their teething kid more Motrin than safely recommended, just to keep entitled neighboors happy?...", "I'd wager that most negative comments are from people without kids.  Not saying this proudly, but until you have dealt with this, it is extremely difficult to fathom", "or, you know, close the door?", "More often than not, I feel like the top comment gets it very right.\n\nThis is *not* one of those times.", "I'm eyerolling so hard right now. I don't have children and do not plan on having biological children, but they are allowed to exist in the world in all the complexities that being a non-verbal human in pain entails.

Just buy a noise machine or noise-cancelling ear buds, ffs.", "Pretty easy to tell the people commenting about this are not parents.", "I've had neighbors threaten to call the police if my kid runs (we lived in the 2nd floor). During the daylight hours (post 10 am and before 8 pm). We had just moved and had little furniture since we'd moved across continents.\n\nFirst thing I did was try to apologize and talk calmly. We ended up moving to a lower floor since I don't want my kid to sit on the couch all day. \n\nI wish I'd handled it better and the only reason why I lean a bit towards ESH is that OP sounds a tad entitled with their comments about their neighbor, especially since they could've tried talking to the neighbor at least once to resolve it. \n\nBut you CANNOT avoid what babies do. Or kids. Kids cry. We were all kids once. You can hate kids, but the world has kids. People are less kind to parents and kids than to animals. I read about people hating on parents who travel with kids - even some fellow asking them to travel via sea and not via air if they've kids. It's just so sad that we couldn't let kids be kids.

I've been trying to keep that in mind whenever I see ridiculous comments, and that's helped me to not rage quit the sub (not saying that's what you're doing). It's been way less annoying for me to just go, \"oh, that commenter is probably a kid or something\" and move on down the thread", "And if OP *was* scheduling meds around the clock, he would be getting attacked for needlessly medicating his child for his own comfort.

The number of \"my child/niece/nephew\" comments are driving me crazy. NOT ALL CHILDREN ARE THE SAME. Just because it worked for you does not mean it will work for every child, and the assumption that it does is what makes parents feel like they're doing something \"wrong\" when their baby doesn't sleep through the night at 6 weeks.", "I never once cried about my ear infections as a baby. My mom was scolded by doctors for not bringing me in sooner when I finally DID cry, because by then they were raging.\n\nThey were so bad I have scarring in my ears that look like I had tubes at one point, but I never did. \n\nI just never felt them.
