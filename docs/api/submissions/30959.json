Maybe her preference has nothing to do with you?\n\nShe would annoy me too, but your attitude sounds as annoying as hers. A young woman can't possibly make enough money to live nice, so you had to shove a \"maybe daddy's money\" in there?\n\nI'm not anti-children at all, and babies cry, sure. But you guys all sound like you deserve each other a little. She shouldn't ring your bell at 3am but also your wife wants to fight her for it like wtf lol.\n\nedit: changed to YTA for deleting the blurb about daddy's money. It all really makes you seem like the less likeable person here and while your neighbor may or may not be annoying too, I can see how you bring out the worst in others with your personality.", "Info why aren't you staying *ahead* of the pain?  Why wait until the poor thing is hurting?????\n\nEdit- yta regardless of all the added info. What you're doing clearly isn't working. You chose to have a baby. Your neighbor didn't. Waking her up every night at 3am is a problem and the solution can't be 'she can deal with it!'", "ESH. You comments about her are awful (especially that \"daddy\" is paying her way.) Her response with the loud music is childish.\n\nIs there some reason why you can't move the doses of Motrin so that it works all night? Maybe a dose at 11:00 pm? That would allow all of you to get a much needed night's sleep. Also, I think they make cold teething rings to help with pain. \n\nTry harder...for you, your child, and you neighbor.", "ESH - but you suck more. Your neighbour sucks for how she seems to have handled the problem. IF her music is directed at you, then she\u2019s taking the passive aggressive route and that\u2019s petty. However I can understand why she\u2019s so upset. She doesn\u2019t have children, and likely needs to rest before work like most other people in existence. If her sleep if being affected every night, I\u2019d be butthurt too. \n\nThat being said, you are a bigger AH. Firstly for not staying ahead of your child\u2019s pain. If this is a developmental phase she\u2019s been going through for some time now, you should be giving her pain meds before she gets to a level that continues to bother your neighborhood. Secondly you\u2019re an AH for your daddy\u2019s money comment. If it takes sooooo much money to live in the building, so much so that a single woman could not possibly be able to afford it on her own without daddy\u2019s help, maybe you and your wife should think about moving. You know, since you\u2019re so well off and can afford such an expensive apartment. It sounds like you can afford to not be an AH, you just don\u2019t want to because you\u2019ve made the choice to have a kid and now everyone must suffer along with you and your horrible wife. Wanting to throw down with the neighbour because YOUR screaming child is disrupting her sleep is pure trash behaviour. Do better, you\u2019re raising a child.", "You say she has been punishing you with stereo placement. How do you know it's a conscious effort to punish and not someone simply not realising what they are doing bothers you? Have you talked about it with her?

It is not her fault? But you seem to have no sympathy for her position. You even go so low as to suggest her apartment is paid for by her daddy instead of her, which seems like a low grade passive aggressive insult. \n\nI am not suggesting that you should somehow force your child to stop crying nor am I suggesting that you are doing anything wrong. Teething is a normal part of child development. But that does mean your choice to have a child should infringe on other people's choice to get a good night sleep. \n\nWhy not go knock on her door and apologize for the night time crying? In fact, I would knock on all your neighbor's doors and apologize. Your unit started this, so take responsibility for it.", "YTA.

Judgmental prick.\nShe has right to sleep at night. It is your child and your responsibility.\nI can bet that if your neighbor had a dog that barked at night, you would make a fuss about it. Because she can't handle it and you and your wife are sooo tired and can't sleep. This is the same. You decided to have a kid, why your neighbor is suffering the consequences? Your child - your sleepless nights, not hers.

Is your child allergic to Tylenol?  If not, why aren't you alternating Tylenol and Motrin so she always has pain and inflammation coverage, with no gap?

I've teethed several children 3 siblings and 3 nieces and nephews yes they scream but not loud enough to hear on another floor unless walls are paper thin but as you said that isnt the case your baby is LOUD in a very well built building take your kid to a doctor, also belittling her cause shes also stressed from your baby WAKING HER ALSO sucks no she shouldnt act childish and angry niether should your wife wanting to fight her and you saying \"daddies money\"  ESH except the baby cause hell its a baby", "ESH but you more, especially for your condescending attitude toward your neighbor.

This could keep everyone happy until her little teeth pop out", "YTA. In a condo, it is YOUR responsibility to not allow your noise to invade others' spaces. If you can't do that, you should live somewhere else. And before you or anyone says that someone that likes quiet should live somewhere else - no. Your noise does NOT get to invade someone else's dwelling. That's all there is to it. And she also should follow that but she's retaliating and you deserve it.

Your wife wanting to fight??? HA! That building can\u2019t be as solidly built as you claim it is if you can hear a child crying through the walls all night long. You also said that she\u2019s loud because your neighbor called her a little terrorist which leads me to believe you just let her holler all loud and shit throughout the day while she\u2019s playing which again is just as disruptive.
