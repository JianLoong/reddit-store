We booked 4 tickets for my mom me, and my 2 sisters. It was something we anticipated as a 'getaway' (I think that's what irs called) after some personal events that I won't get into details. I forgot to bring my luggage until we were at the airport and decided against ubering back and to just borrow my sister's clothes when we get into the hotel. Growing up in a family of girls, it was something that's not unusual for me to borrow their clothes as we used to grow up dirt poor. We did come along and started to get back on our feet where we are able to be where we are now. I'm forever grateful for the moment and of course appreciate mom for getting us here.\n\nWhen we arrived, my sister gave me her shorts and t shirts and I thought she was joking because it was obviously too short. I asked if she had anything longer but the only things were dresses, shorts, and pants that wouldn't really fit me. Growing up poor, I learned to not ask for anything although we were financially stable now because it is something that's been drilled into my brain so I didn't ask for a whole change of clothes. I didn't care about having to wear her clothes, I only cared about how short they were. I explained to mom how embarrassing it is, especially as a teenager but she dismissed it as me being 'over dramatic.' I'll be blunt and say that she is so hard to talk to because she is so old school where she can never ever understand our point of view, and rather thinks we are over reacting. \n\nWhen we went out for dinner, I got a few stares and asked mom if we could just buy regular pants or something to cover up because it is blatantly clear how embarrassing it was. She blew up at me and said that I was 'ruining' the vacation and how she can't catch a break for atleast a day. I explained to her that this could all be solved if I can just change my pants and it had nothing to do with girl clothes as I never asked for a change of shirt either. She lost her mind and threatened to make me wear my sister's dress to 'cover up' if I wanted to so badly. I just stayed silent to not escalate things and cause a scene unlike what she was doing.\n\nShe was never this aggressive until a few months ago regarding a family incident which would explain her anger. I just can't fathom spending a whole week doing something so embarrassing when it can be solved so easily. It just feels like she's taking advantage of my problem to redirect her anger onto me.\n\nI think I may have been the a-hole because it does no harm to anybody and she does deserve a break, but I can't just wear her short shorts for a whole week when this could be solved so easily.", "created_utc": 1688073060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mgnhm/aita_for_ruining_the_vacation_and_casuing_a_scene/", "score": 475, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That makes you a mega asshole. Why do you think she blew up at you and wants to punish you by making you wear a dress? Id bet my house its because you are in general a little shit to your mother and she is bottling up how you make her feel on a regular basis, and she let some of it slip out.\n\nLook, i know youre smack dab in the middle of puberty and whatnot, but for fucks sake, please start to ACTUALLY appreciate your mother, and your sisters for that matter.
