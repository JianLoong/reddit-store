We booked 4 tickets for my mom me, and my 2 sisters. It was something we anticipated as a 'getaway' (I think that's what irs called) after some personal events that I won't get into details. I forgot to bring my luggage until we were at the airport and decided against ubering back and to just borrow my sister's clothes when we get into the hotel. Growing up in a family of girls, it was something that's not unusual for me to borrow their clothes as we used to grow up dirt poor. We did come along and started to get back on our feet where we are able to be where we are now. I'm forever grateful for the moment and of course appreciate mom for getting us here.\n\nWhen we arrived, my sister gave me her shorts and t shirts and I thought she was joking because it was obviously too short. I asked if she had anything longer but the only things were dresses, shorts, and pants that wouldn't really fit me. Growing up poor, I learned to not ask for anything although we were financially stable now because it is something that's been drilled into my brain so I didn't ask for a whole change of clothes. I didn't care about having to wear her clothes, I only cared about how short they were. I explained to mom how embarrassing it is, especially as a teenager but she dismissed it as me being 'over dramatic.' I'll be blunt and say that she is so hard to talk to because she is so old school where she can never ever understand our point of view, and rather thinks we are over reacting. \n\nWhen we went out for dinner, I got a few stares and asked mom if we could just buy regular pants or something to cover up because it is blatantly clear how embarrassing it was. She blew up at me and said that I was 'ruining' the vacation and how she can't catch a break for atleast a day. I explained to her that this could all be solved if I can just change my pants and it had nothing to do with girl clothes as I never asked for a change of shirt either. She lost her mind and threatened to make me wear my sister's dress to 'cover up' if I wanted to so badly. I just stayed silent to not escalate things and cause a scene unlike what she was doing.\n\nShe was never this aggressive until a few months ago regarding a family incident which would explain her anger. I just can't fathom spending a whole week doing something so embarrassing when it can be solved so easily. It just feels like she's taking advantage of my problem to redirect her anger onto me.\n\nI think I may have been the a-hole because it does no harm to anybody and she does deserve a break, but I can't just wear her short shorts for a whole week when this could be solved so easily.", "created_utc": 1688073060, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14mgnhm/aita_for_ruining_the_vacation_and_casuing_a_scene/", "score": 165, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or idk if your sister has a tartan skirt wear treat and speak with a Scottish accent all week.", "Firstly you're supposed to wear it because IT'S YOUR FAULT that you're not having any fun and are humiliated. You want your mother to solve a problem that you created. Could she do it? Sure, but why should she if she thinks this will teach you responsibility which you're clearly lacking?\n\nIf you get allowance, have a job, or have spending money for the trip then you can solve the problem yourself otherwise in this case your mother is not responsible for fixing your mistake if she sees it as a learning experience.", "\u201cWhy should I have to wear that,\u201d bro, come on, you *chose* that. You forgot your luggage, *chose* not to go back for it, and volunteered your sister to share her clothes with you. Now you\u2019re mad because girl shorts are short, as if you somehow never noticed. \n\n\u201cWhy should I have to wear that,\u201d gtfo, why should your sister have to let you wear her limited packed clothes? Why should your mother have to find time and money during her vacation to fix the problem you not only created but refused to fix?", "Because this is your fault, nobody else's.  YTA.  Why should your mom have to buy you more clothes because you didn't  bring any?", "you deserve the humiliation for not being able to be responsible for your own luggage. this was not your mother\u2019s problem and she shouldn\u2019t be responsible for solving it. if you cared so much, you would\u2019ve made sure to bring your luggage or you would\u2019ve gone back for it. this is a consequence of your actions, deal with it.", "Because you didn't go and get your luggage when you had an opportunity to do so \ud83d\udc40", "You have to wear that because instead of being responsible and going back to get your clothes, you're borrowing other people's clothes. Beggars cannot be choosers. No one owes you new clothes because you were too lazy to go back and get your clothes and too irresponsible to bring your luggage in the first place. You're 15 not 5.", "\"Why should I\" Because you fucked up, kid. You keep whinging about how you have to \"\"\"suffer the consequences\"\"\" as if that's somehow unfair? Who do you think you are that you should be exempt from the results of your own actions? When you fuck up, and something undesirable happens as a result of said fuck up, that's just the natural order of things. Like I'm genuinely having a hard time understanding your mindset? Bad things happen to all of us and we all have to deal with it, you included.", "K bruh I get it now I'm sorry", "those are lovely and very true sentiments", "This is an excellent point! You wore bottoms down. Wash them in the sink, hang them to dry on the shower rack, and wear them again. Athletes have to do this all the time when there are multiday events like tournaments.", "Why would I send a picture of it. That's just weird.", "I understand where im wrong now, I get it", "No shit, he seems miserable to deal with", "Ur one to say since you're not in my shoes", "Obviously, I was saying that I care if they're girl shorts because they are shorter l, but idc about the others if they don't reveal skin like that", "So I should wear short shorts and act confident because it's 'my fault' ??", "I get where I'm wrong, I will wear the dress to cover up but i still stand my ground on how it shouldn't have gone so far where there's literally no common ground for a solution", "Apologize give to your mom, not us. It might even get you somewhere", "I\u2019m truly not sure why you would be the asshole here. It\u2019s hectic when you\u2019re traveling and packing. You\u2019re a kid, yeah you forgot your luggage but wtf kind of a parent can\u2019t stop at a Walmart or something to help his son in this situation? NTA. She can relax for the day or evening and then help you out by buying ONE pair of pants to help you be comfortable. Like wtf?\n\nYou\u2019ve been dealing with you\u2019re mother\u2019s recent emotional changes and while she may have gone through something traumatic, she shouldn\u2019t be treating you or talking to you the way she is. You fucking made a mistake and literally no one cares further than \u201cyou have your sisters short ass shorts, you\u2019re good\u201d? You were trying to make it easier for everyone and borrow your sisters clothing, you tried. Your mother seems exhausting tbh\n\n\nNTA, literally at all.", "And will never be, because I would never forget the *one* thing you need to bring on vacation aka luggage.", "You seem like a very selfish entitled little boy.", "You\u2019re right, we\u2019re not in your shoes\u2026because we don\u2019t COMPLETELY FORGET OUR LUGGAGE ON VACATION!!\n\nYta, and I\u2019d be surprised if your family is ever eager to go on a trip with you again\u2026", "Why did you even post this question?  You\u2019ve argued w everyone who has said the exact same thing to you bc it\u2019s obvious.  Please take the feedback and do better or don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time by posting a question then arguing when the repeated answer is not what you wanted to hear.", "Ding ding! You have found your answer!", "Why the quotes around \u201cmy fault?\u201d Do you not accept responsibility for your lack of clothing?", "Yes. How do you forget an entire suitcase? You\u2019re 15, not 5. Grow up. Yta", "Yep. And why do you care? It's not like you'll ever see these people again. Just suck it up and have fun. \n\nPlus it's 2023 and we've all seen guys wear shorts so short that practically everything hung out so I'm betting you're imagining most of it.", "Yes. It\u2019s called natural consequences. You failed to bring clothes and chose to rely on what your sister had to share. Now you are relying on the clothes that your sister is sharing. That\u2019s the choice you made", "I'm assuming that you wore something on the trip to Florida? Time to hand wash and wear that the entire trip. Or you wear your sister's short shorts.", "What you don\u2019t seem to understand is that no one is obligated to find common ground with you to solve a problem you created for yourself. You say this shouldn\u2019t have gone so far as though your family is punishing you, but the truth is you just made a choice you don\u2019t like. No one has to save you from it.", "Why do you keep saying this??? WASH AND RE-WEAR THE FUCKING CLOTHES YOU WORE ON THE PLANE.  \n\nThis has to be rage clickbait.", "You should have gone back to get your suitcase", "Be careful I think dressing in drag is illegal in Florida now... \n\nYTA", "He didn\u2019t even forget it, he realized and purposefully didn\u2019t go back for it !!", "Ok", "Bruh", "U don't get it, why should it be taken this far though when it can be easily solved and we move on", "Bruh what? Was anything I said incorrect?", "So you feel someone with you has both the ability and the obligation to fix the mistake you made?", "Not necessarily,  but to not escalate it yea, but hrre we are"]}
