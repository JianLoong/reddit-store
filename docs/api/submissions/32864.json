I love my job, even if most people think it\u2019s not great.  \nIn the town I live in, there is one high school, middle school, and elementary/preschool, so it\u2019s a pretty small town. I have driven some kids to and from school every day since they were in kindergarten, and I know most of them by name.  \nMy wife (Grace) and I have been married for 30 years and she is my favorite person. She is a middle school teacher so she also knows most of the kids in the town. Last month a family moved here: mom, dad and two kids. The older boy is in high school (Cam), and the younger girl is in elementary school (Mary). They are both on my bus.  \nI noticed that Cam said \u201cthank you\u201d as he was getting off the bus every day, but Mary did not. I obviously was not offended, I figured she might just be shy. But I saw that when she got off the bus she always made a little motion with her hand.  \nI casually mentioned it to Grace at dinner about 3 weeks ago but she also wasn\u2019t sure.  \nLast week, Grace came home very excited to share news with me. She knows Mary\u2019s 5th grade teacher, and she told my wife that Mary is hard of hearing and communicates mostly in ASL.  \nI was surprised and realized that when Mary got off the bus, she must have been signing something to me. The next day, I watched more carefully and memorized the sign. When I got home, I researched it and found that it meant \u201cthank you\u201d.   \nHonestly, this made me so sad that this girl has been communicating with me but I haven\u2019t been able to say anything back. That night I learned two ASL signs. The next day, as Mary was getting off the bus, she looked at me and signed thank you. Before she could walk off the bus I signed \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d and \u201cgood afternoon.\u201d Her face lit up and she gave me a hug. I was so happy that I was able to make her day a little bit better.  \nI told my wife about it and she thought it was so sweet. But, yesterday when I got to M\u2019s stop, I noticed her mom (Dani) was standing there and she did not look happy. I signed the same thing to Mary that I did the previous day and Mary got off the bus but Dani stormed on and started yelling at me. She said that she doesn\u2019t want anyone communicating with Mary in ASL, because that was her job to interpret for Mary because Mary needed to \u201clearn to communicate since not everyone knows ASL''   \nShe also said that I was a perv/weirdo for wanting to \"talk\" to Mary so bad. I tried to apologize but she kept yelling. Dani told me to not sign to Mary again. Dani requested for her to have another bus driver but no other buses go to that neighborhood and she couldn\u2019t pick Mary up because of work.  \nMe and my wife can\u2019t have children so in some ways, I think of the kids I drive as our kids (not in a creepy way) so I was upset Dani thought I was creepy when I was really just trying to brighten Mary\u2019s day a bit. My wife doesn\u2019t think I was wrong, so I wanted to ask for advice.", "created_utc": 1702352623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18gcq3x/aita_for_learning_asl/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hey, you know what? It\u2019s a matter of safety. You have to be able to communicate with the kids in case of emergency. And you can explain that to the mom. Just let her know that you wanted to make contact with the girl so that 1) she felt included and 2) she was safe. \n\nYou are doing an amazing job and going above and beyond. Might be worth mentioning this to someone at the school or whomever you report to in case the mom gets weird.

Somehow *dumber*.", "You\u2019re never an asshole for trying to communicate.", "What a loving and thoughtful thing to do. A big NTA.", "Major NTA!!!!\n\nThe girls mother should have never treated you like that. That mother was extremely rude to you and that is just horrible. Especially since you want into the effort in your own accord to learn how to communicate with her daughter.\nYou obviously made the girl very happy. I think her mother has been preventing everyone from learning ASL to communicate with her. This obviously would make the girl feel isolated and alone so you doing that act of kindness must\u2019ve been amazing to the girl.\nI feel bad for the young girl to be isolated like that because her mother would rather put other people over her daughter.\nContinue what you are doing!! You are an amazing role model to those kids and I hope you can continue to communicate with the girl and make her feel not alone.", "NTA. A large chunk of my extended family is deaf, and I can almost guarantee this would make their day if they noticed someone went out of their way to learn how to communicate with them/their children. \n\nIt can sometimes be isolating when you\u2019re unable to communicate with the people around you, I think what you did was very kind!! That little girl will not have her mother to interpret for her forever, and I\u2019m surprised the mom even said what she said!", "Hard NTA - it\u2019s  super sweet of you to go the extra mile to make sure you can communicate with all of your students. Mom will have to learn how to back off, hopefully sooner rather than later.", "Hardcore NTA, that child deserves to see ASL used and her mom is clearly trying to keep her child dependent on her", "NTA you\u2019re making your bus more accessible.", "NTA you are making that kids day.", "NTA. Those parents are completely off their rocker, it sounds like. To try and make you lose your job for having learnt a few signs to make their daughter feel welcome. Well, I never. I would earn proficiency in ASL just to spite her. I think it is great that you made the effort and I am so sorry that these asshats are giving you trouble. I don't know where they are coming from at all.", "NTA. You\u2019re the kind of person who makes a community work. I\u2019m so sorry the mom said you\u2019re a perv. Please don\u2019t be discouraged by this inappropriate comment from a stressed and misguided mother. It sucks that people like you are so few and far between that others assume corrupt motives.", "NTA.", "NTA. That was really sweet of you. The mom needs to chill.", "NTA. It may be the case that the mom needs to help teach Mary how to communicate with those who don't sign, but there's also parents who try to force children with poor hearing to communicate without signing because the think they can train them out of their deafness. Either way, her reaction was uncalled for.", "NTA.  Mary\u2019s mom certainly is!  Her mom is being ableist and not doing Mary any favors. \n\nSince Mary is hear of hearing, she may have an IEP. As her bus driver, you are part of her educational team.  Ask at the school if they have any guidance on how to communicate with her.  I would even let them know about your interaction with her mom.  And keep learning some signs to help Mary access her world.  You\u2019re doing great work!", "NTA!! and the mom definitely is", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Out of all the people I would expect to be touched by your sweet gesture, it would be the parents. I\u2019m honestly floored by her response. I feel sorry for Mary for having such a crappy mom in this regard. I imagine life is tough enough for her as is. Having someone communicate with her on a level she is able to, but isn\u2019t common, must be wonderful for her. Her response makes me think so. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with such undeserved negative backlash from the mother.", "NTA I agree it was a sweet gesture. The mom is projecting on you her own weird issues. Perhaps just smile and wave instead so she does not get upset and cause you issues at your job.", "NTA and you sound like a wonderful person! Thank you for being a great bus driver. You did nothing wrong AT ALL. You were NOT being creepy. \n\nShame shame shame on that mother for treating you so poorly. She needs to apologize to you for those accusations. Your wife is right! \n\nI feel so awful for Mary.", "You saw how her face lit up when you signed to her yeah?\n\nNo way you're the AH here.", "The mom is right that not everyone knows ASL. But that doesn\u2019t mean nobody knows ASL. Does the mom also try to prevent her daughter from befriending classmates who might have deaf parents or siblings? What a sad and baffling attitude. NTA.", "NTA. This reminds me of a few stories I\u2019ve read where deaf or hard of hearing people refuse to wear hearing aids. This reeks of the mother forcing hearing on her daughter. A deaf person (or child) should make that decision for themselves, and it\u2019s heartbreaking that her mother is taking that away from her especially when it seems that ASL is her preferred method of communication.", "NTA. Honestly I think the school needs to be stepping in, this feels borderline abusive to me. She\u2019s not allowing her daughter to communicate with people. This can\u2019t be healthy for the daughter.", "NTA. Also the mom is fricking dipshit. Marys mother translating for her all the time will not help her learn to communicate herself. If she wants her kid to learn to communicate outside of ASL give her a dang notepad, or tablet set up for communication. Also she should be happy that someone took the time to learn some signs and put a smile on her kids face. Obviously the kids gonna be most comfortable communicating in her own language.", "NTA. I don't think this has anything to do with safety. She's probably more upset your undermining her efforts to get her to talk, which makes this sorry excuse for a parent the asshole.", "NTA I do not say this lightly, please report her to child protective services.  It needs to be addressed that this mother doesn\u2019t want anyone to communicate with her daughter.  \n\nAnd I would get a lawyers advice before continuing to drive her to school.", "That mom is off her rocker. You were just trying to be kind to Mary and the mom wouldn\u2019t even listen. Sounds like you\u2019re a decent human being.", "NTA.  The mother is doing more harm than good to the girl.  I feel sad for Mary.", "NTA. There\u2019s sadly a long history of hearing people trying to force deaf people to communicate verbally rather than through signing", "You would be amazed at how many people prefer to see their children struggle to speak badly than to see them able to communicate with other people.\n\nNTA.\n\nDon't apologize to Dani, and don't communicate directly with her. If she has something to say, she can send it through the proper channels. You did nothing wrong.", "JFC. Absolutely NTA.\n\nThat was really nice of you to learn a few signs just so you could *minimally* communicate with Mary.\n\nDani, on the other hand, is over reaching. Calling you a perv/weirdo for wanting to do the basic humane action of communication in a mutual language? What is she, the ASL gatekeeper? Is she going to be with Mary 24/7 for the rest of Mary's life? Talk about being a helicopter parent!", "NTA but Dani sure as hell is! I'd be tempted to contact the school and possibly CPS as is this not abuse?", "Nta. Mom is an ableist", "NTA sounds like the mother is one of those \"force the kid to be normal\" parents.  She's gate keeping people talking with her daughter.", "It\u2019s sadly quite common for hearing parents of deaf children to be against their kid learning sign - maybe bc they want their kid to be \u201cnormal\u201d or bc they don\u2019t want to make the effort to learn sign themselves and don\u2019t want their kid to communicate without them. That may be what\u2019s happening here.", "1000x this"]}
