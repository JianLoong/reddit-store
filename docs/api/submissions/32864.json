I love my job, even if most people think it\u2019s not great.  \nIn the town I live in, there is one high school, middle school, and elementary/preschool, so it\u2019s a pretty small town. I have driven some kids to and from school every day since they were in kindergarten, and I know most of them by name.  \nMy wife (Grace) and I have been married for 30 years and she is my favorite person. She is a middle school teacher so she also knows most of the kids in the town. Last month a family moved here: mom, dad and two kids. The older boy is in high school (Cam), and the younger girl is in elementary school (Mary). They are both on my bus.  \nI noticed that Cam said \u201cthank you\u201d as he was getting off the bus every day, but Mary did not. I obviously was not offended, I figured she might just be shy. But I saw that when she got off the bus she always made a little motion with her hand.  \nI casually mentioned it to Grace at dinner about 3 weeks ago but she also wasn\u2019t sure.  \nLast week, Grace came home very excited to share news with me. She knows Mary\u2019s 5th grade teacher, and she told my wife that Mary is hard of hearing and communicates mostly in ASL.  \nI was surprised and realized that when Mary got off the bus, she must have been signing something to me. The next day, I watched more carefully and memorized the sign. When I got home, I researched it and found that it meant \u201cthank you\u201d.   \nHonestly, this made me so sad that this girl has been communicating with me but I haven\u2019t been able to say anything back. That night I learned two ASL signs. The next day, as Mary was getting off the bus, she looked at me and signed thank you. Before she could walk off the bus I signed \u201cyou\u2019re welcome\u201d and \u201cgood afternoon.\u201d Her face lit up and she gave me a hug. I was so happy that I was able to make her day a little bit better.  \nI told my wife about it and she thought it was so sweet. But, yesterday when I got to M\u2019s stop, I noticed her mom (Dani) was standing there and she did not look happy. I signed the same thing to Mary that I did the previous day and Mary got off the bus but Dani stormed on and started yelling at me. She said that she doesn\u2019t want anyone communicating with Mary in ASL, because that was her job to interpret for Mary because Mary needed to \u201clearn to communicate since not everyone knows ASL''   \nShe also said that I was a perv/weirdo for wanting to \"talk\" to Mary so bad. I tried to apologize but she kept yelling. Dani told me to not sign to Mary again. Dani requested for her to have another bus driver but no other buses go to that neighborhood and she couldn\u2019t pick Mary up because of work.  \nMe and my wife can\u2019t have children so in some ways, I think of the kids I drive as our kids (not in a creepy way) so I was upset Dani thought I was creepy when I was really just trying to brighten Mary\u2019s day a bit.

Out of all the people I would expect to be touched by your sweet gesture, it would be the parents. I\u2019m honestly floored by her response. I feel sorry for Mary for having such a crappy mom in this regard. I imagine life is tough enough for her as is. Having someone communicate with her on a level she is able to, but isn\u2019t common, must be wonderful for her. Her response makes me think so. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with such undeserved negative backlash from the mother.", "NTA I agree it was a sweet gesture. The mom is projecting on you her own weird issues. Perhaps just smile and wave instead so she does not get upset and cause you issues at your job.", "NTA and you sound like a wonderful person! Thank you for being a great bus driver. You did nothing wrong AT ALL. You were NOT being creepy. \n\nShame shame shame on that mother for treating you so poorly. She needs to apologize to you for those accusations. Your wife is right! \n\nI feel so awful for Mary.", "You saw how her face lit up when you signed to her yeah?\n\nNo way you're the AH here.", "The mom is right that not everyone knows ASL. But that doesn\u2019t mean nobody knows ASL. Does the mom also try to prevent her daughter from befriending classmates who might have deaf parents or siblings? What a sad and baffling attitude. NTA.", "NTA. This reminds me of a few stories I\u2019ve read where deaf or hard of hearing people refuse to wear hearing aids. This reeks of the mother forcing hearing on her daughter. A deaf person (or child) should make that decision for themselves, and it\u2019s heartbreaking that her mother is taking that away from her especially when it seems that ASL is her preferred method of communication.", "NTA. Honestly I think the school needs to be stepping in, this feels borderline abusive to me. She\u2019s not allowing her daughter to communicate with people. This can\u2019t be healthy for the daughter.", "NTA. Also the mom is fricking dipshit. Marys mother translating for her all the time will not help her learn to communicate herself. If she wants her kid to learn to communicate outside of ASL give her a dang notepad, or tablet set up for communication. Also she should be happy that someone took the time to learn some signs and put a smile on her kids face. Obviously the kids gonna be most comfortable communicating in her own language.", "NTA. I don't think this has anything to do with her impressions of you as a perv. She's probably more upset your undermining her efforts to get the child to talk, which makes this sorry excuse for a parent the asshole. \u0130 really dislike oralists.", "NTA I do not say this lightly, please report her to child protective services.  It needs to be addressed that this mother doesn\u2019t want anyone to communicate with her daughter.  \n\nAnd I would get a lawyers advice before continuing to drive her to school.", "That mom is off her rocker. You were just trying to be kind to Mary and the mom wouldn\u2019t even listen. Sounds like you\u2019re a decent human being.", "NTA.  The mother is doing more harm than good to the girl.

There\u2019s sadly a long history of hearing people trying to force deaf people to communicate verbally rather than through signing", "You would be amazed at how many people prefer to see their children struggle to speak badly than to see them able to communicate with other people.\n\nNTA.\n\nDon't apologize to Dani, and don't communicate directly with her. If she has something to say, she can send it through the proper channels. You did nothing wrong.", "JFC. Absolutely NTA.\n\nThat was really nice of you to learn a few signs just so you could *minimally* communicate with Mary.\n\nDani, on the other hand, is over reaching. Calling you a perv/weirdo for wanting to do the basic humane action of communication in a mutual language? What is she, the ASL gatekeeper? Is she going to be with Mary 24/7 for the rest of Mary's life? Talk about being a helicopter parent!", "NTA but Dani sure as hell is! I'd be tempted to contact the school and possibly CPS as is this not abuse?", "Nta. Mom is an ableist", "NTA sounds like the mother is one of those \"force the kid to be normal\" parents.  She's gate keeping people talking with her daughter.", "It\u2019s sadly quite common for hearing parents of deaf children to be against their kid learning sign - maybe bc they want their kid to be \u201cnormal\u201d or bc they don\u2019t want to make the effort to learn sign themselves and don\u2019t want their kid to communicate without them. That may be what\u2019s happening here.", "1000x this", "Moms like Dani are absolutely despised in the Deaf community. They force their kids to adapt to hearing people, and deny them access to their own community and language (ASL) thinking it will make their lives \"easier\". It's a form of child abuse, because it's the same as not allowing your child to talk to anyone except you, and denying them the ability to communicate. It's called Linguistic Neglect, and can have significant cognitive impairments for the child: https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/linguistic-neglect-of-deaf-children-in-the-united-states\n\nLearn ASL and give this kid a chance to communicate!\n\nNTA, but I would report the mom!", "NTA there is a big divide in the deaf community about parents like her. Some go as far as refusing to teach or let their children learn ASL. You did nothing wrong. Most deaf people would be extremely happy that someone went out of their way to learn something to communicate with them and you definitely made that girls day. She will remember you fondly growing up and likely have a contentious relationship with her mother if that's any indication of how she treats her.", "NTA and bravo to you for making an effort.

That mother is crazy and abusive. She doesn't want her daughter to be able to communicate with people?\nYou are doing a very decent thing.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re awesome mate!\nThat mother is a psycho AH.\nI feel so sorry for the kid.", "Totally NTA, but Dani certainly is. Her heart may be in the right place but her actions are reprehensible. You went farther than most people would go to validate a little girl who is probably severely isolated by her hearing, and compounded by a mother that creates an unnecessary and probably detrimental further barrier. You keep up the good work and don't let this woman control you, in fact, if this continues or escalates, you should consider reporting her to whatever your state has that is the equivalent of what is here in CA called Child Protective Services, or CPS. Her behavior borders on abuse of her daughter and harassment toward you.", "My heart broke a bit when I read the mother\u2019s reaction. You sir are NTA and I wish there were more people in the world who gave a shit. You should have been a teacher, people like you make all the difference to a child\u2019s life. \n\nIm not one to judge but I imagine a very controlling and manipulative parent. \u2018Because it\u2019s her job to , interpre because she needs to learn to communicate because not everyone knows ASL\u2019 \nIf mother is constantly interpreting how is Mary going to learn to communicate? - she\u2019s just going to learn how to become dependent on mum greatly effecting her quality of life later on. \n\nI don\u2019t understand the mums reaction, as a parent I\u2019d be grateful someone took the time to communicate with my child the way OP has. It can be extremely lonely navigating the world when you aren\u2019t like everyone else. \n\nJust because sign language isn\u2019t well known it doesn\u2019t mean Mary\u2019s communication should be restricted. There are ample opportunities for deaf people who communicate with sign language. It might not be common but as demonstrated by OP people will put the effort in to learn - if they are made aware and given the opportunity. \n\nI can imagine Mary\u2019s joy when OP communicated with her. It must be a very lonely world sometimes. \n\nMaybe in a slight retaliation you can do some good. Speak to the school and see if you can promote lessons in sign language, or an event that celebrates and educates the students on ASL, set up an after school club for those who\u2019ve shown an interest? \n\nASL should be taught at schools, just like they teach French (I\u2019m in the uk!) \n\nDefinitely turn the mums negative into a positive. It might help the mum understand a bit too.", "NTA honestly the first thing I thought from her mum's rant was \"safeguarding\". Its worrying she is so adamant about being the only person her daughter can communicate with. Also, having been in a country where noone spoke my language, nothing brighten your day more than someone greating you in your own language. Its lonely and isolating otherwise.", "NTA. Remember that time the deaf community got mad at a cure for deafness being found and applied to babies because they \"didn't consent to having access to the special world of deaf people being revoked\" (aka there's now less misery that's going to be in their company)?

What if there's a medical emergency? Mom's not on the bus or at school.\n\nI might ask your boss or the principal about the Mom's anger and intransience.

I have experience in childcare and the mom's behavior is something that sends a big red flag. The school would definantly be interested as it could indicate abuse.", "It is common for parents of disabled children regardless of what the precise disability is to abuse their kids into acting as abled as possible, causing huge trauma in the process. This is not just acceptable but lauded by society.", "Nothing borderline about this. Isolating a child is abuse, straight up.", "If she's not allowed to communicate with anyone else, that's still going to be linguistic neglect. It's highly unlikely the mom is fluent in ASL, especially grammatically, and daughter won't be able to fully communicate in English.

Because in my experience most American public schools *don't* offer Latin.\n\nAdmittedly it's a very large country and it's not easy to generalize, but nevertheless...."]}
