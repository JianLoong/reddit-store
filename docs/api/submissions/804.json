My wife forgave me but she made it clear that she doesn't want to be anywhere near my daughter. I have my daughter every other weekend and my wife would just go to her parents home every time she is with me.\n\nA few days ago we were going out with my extended family and my daughter was also invited but her mom wasn't invited. She asked me if I could give her a ride and I said yes but when my wife found out she said that while she doesn't have a problem with my daughter being there she doesn't want her to come with us. I tried to change her mind but I couldn't so I asked both my brothers if either of them would bring my daughter with them. They both said yes so I called my daughter and told her I have some problem and asked her to come with one of her uncles and she said it's ok\n\nWell we went there and both my brothers came and my daughter wasn't with either one of them. They both said that my daughter told them she is going with the other one\n\nI called her and her mom and all her friends but no one knew where she is so everyone just left to search for her and after a few hours my son found her. I was so mad at her I yelled at her and told her how she made us all worried. I took away her car(that I bought for her) as a punishment\n\nHer mom has been calling me, saying I'm an asshole and demanding I give her car back\n\nEdit: just to clarify, she didn't drive there because it had a dangerous road and she is not a good driver so I told her she is not allowed to drive there", "created_utc": 1667323771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjf15c/aita_for_punishing_my_daughter_for_making_us_all/", "score": 3319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is not responsible for your infidelity. It is not fair that you let your wife punish her for your mistake.", "YTA  \nI'm sorry I get that your wife is upset with your cheating but she is putting all her anger and hurt feelings onto your daughter. You have two children and if your wife can't see that, then you both should end this relationship. Your daugther deserves to have her dad in her life as much as your son does.\n\nIf your son is allowed to come with you to an event, then so should your daugther. And if you want to support your wife and can't stick up for your child then she is better off without you.", "YTA.\n\n I feel bad for your partner for your adultery, and your daughter for this overreaction.", "YTA, but not really for the car thing - you're AH for creating a situation your child feels unwanted and a burden. I get your wife - I don't know if I would be able to be around my partner's affair kid - but nevertheless, this situation sucks for your daughter.", "INFO: what was your daughter's reason for not riding with one of her uncles? If no one knew where she was, where was she found?", "ESH.  You are TA for letting your wife mistreat your daughter like this.  What did your daughter ever do to deserve being ostracized?  It's weird that your wife can forgive you for your infidelity while taking her anger and frustration out on an innocent girl who had nothing to do with the poor choices you made.\n\nI can't blame your 16 year old daughter for not wanting to come to an event where has already been made to feel unwelcome, but I do think that the way she went about turning down the invitation was wrong.  She should have confronted you outright instead of passive aggressively telling each of her potential rides that she already had the transportation covered.\n\nAll in all, I'm far more willing to forgive a 16 year old's short-term thoughtlessness over the chronic abuse inflicted by a spineless grown man and his shrew of a wife.\n\nAs for taking the car, let me tell you how this will play out long-term.  She will eventually come to realize that she doesn't need a darn thing from you and that you can keep your stupid gifts if you're just going to hold them hostage to her placid compliance.  Ten years from now you're going to be wondering why she never calls or visits.  You will likely have forgotten all about this situation by then, but I guarantee that she will still remember.", "Question: did you ask her why she did it?", "YTA- you failed your child.  Hey kid you can go to the family function but your step mom can\u2019t stand the sight of you much less get in a car with you. Since you are a child plus a shitty driver, in order to be in my esteemed presence and your evil step mother\u2019s golden presence, you must ride with one of your uncles. 16 year old child that has been left out and mentally abused by dad and step mom for something the child had NO control over is once again left to feel like less decides to tell Dad FU and FU step mom and not go and not answer you because she rightly was upset, sad, pissed etc\u2026\n\nJesus man - she is 16 and every time you pick your wife over her. Every time.  You were the one who effed around and got found out not your child.  So instead of seeing this a hit you over the head with a hammer cry for help from your daughter you double down and take her car.  Once again showing her your the boss and even when you treat her like the ugly u wanted step kid- you stab the knife in to make sure she knows it.  I know what she did was wrong scary but it got your attention.  You created this scenario not her.  Do you think this would have gone down if you had picked her up? Your wife has created an untenable situation and it is screwing with your child.  Get therapy and get family therapy.  16 years are not adults - this is a horrible situation to place a child in so you must be the adult and figure this out because you will lose your daughter with this type of alienating behavior.  My heart hurts for her.  Be a father.", "So really the only question here is why your daughter didn't drive herself in her own car.  The vehicle that you hadn't yet taken away in a major overreaction.", "YTA. You treat your daughter like an afterthought, so she treated you like one. She's a kid. What's your excuse?", "Wife - AH - forgiveness does not carry a prison sentence towards innocent children who did not commit a crime.  If your wife wants to be part of your life, then she needs to be part of it.  Not carefully edited to her liking. \n\nOP - AH - stop letting your wife punish your daughter.  If she is part of your life and you been forgiven.  Then you daughter who committed no wrong should be given half a chance. \n\nUncle's - sorta clueless but it's wasn't there job to ensure daughter got a ride. \n\nDaughter - brilliant.\n\nYour daughter was crying out for attention.  She was happy with herself because she saw what has been inflicted onto her for who knows how many years. \n\nWhat kind of lame punishment could you possibly dish out over being repeatedly made to feel unimportant and a faint inconvenience?  Did you take her phone away? Send her to her room? Ground her from seeing her friends?  I doubt beating her would correct this emerging behavior.  \n\nBecause at the end of the day.  At least you are paying her attention.  You are actually there showing her what she really means to you.  \n\nNow enough of the excuses.  Sense when does forgiveness carry a sentence for an innocent child?  \n\nYour daughter didn't do anything to justify you wife wrath.\n\nNow stop throwing your own fit becuase she is acting out in ways to get your attention.  \n\nInstead, take your wife car away too.  After all you were forgive and if you could have just given your daughter a ride like your promised to do.  Your daughter would not have been emotionally hurt to the point of begging for any attention that she could get from her father.", "Why is your wife able to forgive you for cheating but feels the need to punish your daughter who has not wronged her? \n\nYTA for letting things get this far\n\nWas your daughter\u2019s behaviour a problem?

Either divorce her or not be in the child\u2019s life at all. Not make her feel like a burden for the last 16 years.", "YTA - and YWTA - Your Wife\u2019s The Asshole. Totally. Your daughter has had to grow up knowing her dad is married to someone who makes no secret of wishing she - *your child*- didn\u2019t even exist. This should never have happened. Once you decided to be in your daughter\u2019s life (the right thing to do) your wife had two options: either divorce you bc she couldn\u2019t deal with your cheating and the resulting child; or stay and commit to working through her jealousy and acknowledging that your daughter is part of your life and therefore also part of her\u2019s. What the two of you have done instead amounts to emotional abuse and big surprise! The kid is acting out! You think she didn\u2019t figure out your childish, selfish wife wasn\u2019t willing to even have her in the car? That you were willing to put up with that crap, as usual, instead of standing up for your own kid? Then she loses the car you gave her as - what, a secret Santa? Oh, no. forgot, you\u2019re her FATHER. Seems you and your wife do your best to forget this too. If you guys don\u2019t address the situation and agree it\u2019s long past time for both of you, together, to acknowledge this child is real family, despite the pain involved with how that came to be, you can expect many more incidents of so called \u201cacting out\u201d, culminating with your daughter either disappearing on you to salvage her ego, or worst case scenario, self destructing. \n\nWhy am I reacting so intensely to this post? I\u2019ve been in the shoes you\u2019re now forcing your daughter to wear. It got harder and harder to walk in them. As I got older, knowing my father chose his wife\u2019s wishes over my existence, I felt horrible about myself. I acted out. I got into huge, almost obliterating trouble in my teens. Then I gave up on him. I last spoke to him when I was 21 years old. Decades ago.", "YTA. You have no one to blame but yourself, you have been shirking your responsibility to your daughter.", "YTA. Your daughter did this to you because you\u2019ve clearly shown her just how much you don\u2019t care about her. Tell your wife to get over her damn self.

You sound like a poor excuse of a husband and a father", "YTA, so is your wife.", "YTA and your wife is also TA in this situation.

Clearly your wife will not allow you to be the father your daughter needs, but the choice is still yours.", "YTA.  Taking her car away for this infraction is too large a response and it is not a logical consequence.\n\nThe extra context, showing that she probably feels like you let her down by promising one thing then reneging on it, whether you told her the truth about your wife not wanting her in the car or whether you prevaricated, makes me more sympathetic about why she might have avoided going to the event.  I'm also surprised that you didn't solve the problem by letting your wife drive on her own, but going with your daughter in her car, either with you driving it or using it as an opportunity to coach her on more difficult driving.    \n\n\nI think you need to apologize to your daughter for making a promise you couldn't keep.

If you cared enough at the time you would\u2019ve left her and realized that being divorced is better than being a shite parent.\n\nOnto another thing, your daughter is not dumb. She knows that the reason she was unable to come with you was because of your wife. To be honest I would\u2019ve not showed up either. Your daughter does need to be disciplined in some way but it\u2019s not the end of the world. She is at that age where she could easily tell her mom that she doesn\u2019t wanna see you anymore.

You could have spoken to her to see what the issue was and given her some lackluster punishment for her disappearing act. Taking the car is a bit much.  You and her mother have brought a child into an unwelcoming situation.  She more than likely knows she is an affair baby, knows your wife takes issue with her in general...just the fact that in her eyes the whole world knows she is the product of an affair is hard on her.  You definitely need to stop acting like it's just a kid thing and she's acting out. She probably is acting out but look at the twisted situation you and her mother put her in. She will never be accepted 100% by your wife.  She will always be known as the product of an affair. People will do the math..see that she has a different mom.

YTA for picking your wife over your daughter 16 years ago. She didn't forgive you for the cheating if she will not allow your daughter to be around her. I don't blame her for not wanting to be around your daughter because it's a constant reminder of your betrayal (again, she didn't really forgive you.) When your wife said all those years ago that she wouldn't be around your kid, *you* should have said your kids and you are a package deal.

What kind of woman forgives said man but punishes the product of the infidelity? What kind of father condones the treatment of their daughter?YTA.", "YTA - she is your daughter. You are hurting your daughter by not being there for her. Part of your penance should be to stand up to our wife and fight for your daughter.", "For 16 years you've let your wife act like your daughter doesn't exist. Really think about that. Let it sink in.\nYTA", "ESH\n\nYour wife set a very clear boundary when she agreed to stay with you, and you need to respect that. Giving your daughter a ride, with you and your wife, violates that boundary.\n\nIf, after cheating, you were unwilling or unable to respect your wife's boundary, you needed to say so and go for divorce yourself, so you could do right by both of your children.\n\nYour wife should not be being kicked out of her own home every other weekend for the sake of your visitation - there should have been a much better plan organized.\n\nYour wife's boundary probably wasn't practical, but that doesn't mean that she's obliged to spend time with the child that resulted from your cheating on her.  It is a rational boundary - if she knows she won't be able to separate her feelings about the cheating from the child, then she absolutely should not be interacting with the child at all, rather than having her resentment affect the child when she is around.\n\nAnd you get another AH because you planned so badly for your daughter to come to this gathering.  You knew your wife's boundary, so having her ride with you and your wife should never have been considered.  Likewise, having her there when you wife would be there - you needed to arrange either for your wife or your daughter to not attend, having your daughter there when your wife was there ignores your wife's boundary around this issue, and it is your job to both respect your wife's boundaries and take care of your daughter, as difficult as coordinating these two obligations may be.\n\n\"Go with one of your uncles\" was not a specific plan, and you should have picked one uncle, and set up a specific plan that they would meet your daughter at a specific time and place and pick her up to drive her.\n\nYou need to be better organized, all around, with your various responsibilities to your wife, your daughter, and coordinating things to respect all involved.\n\nAnd if this is a very complicated responsibility, it's your own fault, for cheating in the first place, not using birth control, and generally making a mess of your life and relationships.\n\nETA: And punishing your daughter by taking away her car, because she was confused by your utterly chaotic planning for her transportation to the gathering, is arbitrary, unfair, and unreasonable.  \n\nShe's sixteen, it isn't her job to organize her way out of your chaos.", "You're an asshole.", "YTA and so is your wife.", "YTA you took her car?

You have years to make up for and the first step would be making it clear to your wife that she will be in your life and that she needs to stop hating your daughter for your mistake.

This poor girl has been punished for her whole life and treated second class because you couldn\u2019t keep it in your pants and your wife can\u2019t move past it.

Is this for real?\n\nOP cheats on his pregnant wife. Said wife \u201cforgives\u201d him, in finger quotations, but refuses to be around the innocent child that came out of the mess. So instead of the wife being a grown up and taking her anger out on her cheating AH husband, she\u2019s taking it out on the kid, to the extent that this 16 year old girl can\u2019t even get a lift to a family event with her own father, because that\u2019s how bitter she is.\n\nMeanwhile, not only does OP refuse to let his daughter drive the car he brought her, as a gift I\u2019m assuming, but when his daughter asks HIM  for a lift, he not only REFUSES on behalf of his bitter wife, he basically tells her she\u2019s not important to him. After all, she doesn\u2019t deserve a lift, because the bitter grown woman, can\u2019t handle sharing space with an innocent teen for a car journey. Then he fobs her off on her uncles, and gets angry that instead of being shafted by her father, as usual, she decided to put him last. I mean, OP last minute, tells his 16 year old daughter, she\u2019s going with one of her uncles, instead of him, because his wife doesn\u2019t want her there, and probably for the millionth time in her life, is told she comes last. I wouldn\u2019t turn up to that event either. \n\nHonestly, it sounds like OP didn\u2019t care if she turned up or not, after basically banning her from going on her own, and basically telling her to hitchhike with anyone else but him. He told her last minute, so I absolutely don\u2019t blame the kid for just not telling OP where she was going to be. He certainly didn\u2019t care, until it made him look like an AH, when she didn\u2019t turn up as he expected. So then he punishes her? Why? Because she made him look bad, not because he actually cared. If OP or the rest of his family have a damn about this girl, she wouldn\u2019t be relegated to the back of the room, and punished for not conforming to what OP expects. \n\nHonestly, I really hope this poor girl gets some therapy for herself, to deal with her toxic father, and basically cuts him out of her life and goes no contact, when she hits 18.

She probably did the best for her own son which was to not get divorced. Im sure many people would do the same. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t a walk in the park for her to accept her husband\u2019s affair in addition to dealing with a newborn. Saying this for probably the 100th time, but  the husband should have been the one calling the shots on how to rectify the situation including suggesting divorce if he really cared about his daughter. I\u2019ve already put my point across. Either you agree or don\u2019t", "Agree to disagree then", "And how many things has she forced the daughter to be left out of? That\u2019s absolutely emotional abuse. And that\u2019s not accounting for the likelihood that she almost definitely poisoned the son against his sister because she clearly puts effort into making sure daughter is less than in the family", "Yeah it is totally ridiculous the wife has to leave her home, the husband should be getting a hotel or staying at his parents when it\u2019s his weekends", "What family birthdays or holidays? The kid isn\u2019t part of the family. She has the moms side of the family and the dads side of the family.", "Yes. This is on the father in every way. He is choosing to keep his marriage over his daughter. Anyone is allowed to have conditions on a relationship, it's up to  them to decide if it's worth it or not.", "She is emotionally abusive. Treating this child like she's less than because her husband fucked someone else guess what it's nit the kids fault he put his dick in another woman unprotected. The kid didn't do anything wrong the kid has no say in being born. Op is allowing his wife to abuse his daughter and by doing that he is abusing his daughter emotionally. They are playing games with her mental health. And you're not the only one who grew up with abuse not all abuse is bruises and broken bones.", "Interesting because having lived this type of emotional abuse a therapist helped me name it. But I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a total expert on emotional abuse.\n\nAnd yes. The child matters more than her feelings because she was a child", "Giving an innocent child trauma and making her feel less than is not an acceptable  option", "If the father got together with the mother of his daughter, that would be a completely different situation as she is well aware that he already has another child. The current wife agreed to and married a man that had no other children. It is not on her to accept someone else\u2019s child into her life after that.", "She does accept that he has a daughter. And OP accepted that she does not need to be a part of her life. There is no way she owes more to a child unrelated to her than to her own child. That\u2019s just absurd. Choosing to stay married to him because it\u2019s best for her son does not mean she has to accept being a step parent. Again, it is not selfish of her to do what\u2019s best for her own child.", "So if the wife divorced like everyone is saying she should have since she didn\u2019t want to be a stepparent *that she never agreed to*, how would that work? Oh right almost the exact same way. Families that divorce because of cheating have certain family members at events and not others. He\u2019d go to only seeing his son every other weekend too and maybe the half siblings wouldn\u2019t see each other at all. The wife\u2019s life would be a *hell* of a lot easier to not see the girl. The girl would go from what some see as a nuisance to the reason the family broke up. The son may even resent his sister because his family is no longer together. Commenters making forgiveness this easy all or nothing scenario is really not people realistic.", "She is very guilty. She decided to stay with her husband, but she hasn't forgiven him. Instead, she's placed her anger on an innocent child so that she can just shove her in the corner and ignore her, and play happy family. It sucks that she was cheated on but you don't get to treat a child like this. She should have left him if she couldn't get over it. She is very much an asshole for treating a child like this for 16 years! Obviously the husband is an asshole for cheating and for allowing his wife to treat his daughter this way. But the wife sucks soooo much as well.", "Sorry but a child being the product of an affair doesn\u2019t give someone the right to emotionally abuse that child.", "Our disagreement lies in that the OP is the only asshole. He's the only ones who is emotionally abusive. \n\nThe woman who never spends a moment of time with her, isn't abusive. (She's wrong imo, but this isn't abuse. )", "You\u2019ve had a therapist tell you that a woman you\u2019ve never met, who is not related to you whatsoever, and wants nothing to do with you is emotional abuse? I highly doubt it. \n\nAnd yes, I spent a full year in EMDR therapy addressing emotional and physical abuse. No therapist would ever say not getting to spend time with someone you\u2019ve never interacted with, who is not related to you or a caretaker to you is emotional abuse.", "That\u2019s on the girls parents. This woman is nothing to the child. They have no relationship.", "Circumstances change,\n\nShe chose to STAY in a relationship where she KNEW her husband would have to be a present and available parent to another person. She has actively prevented that."]}
