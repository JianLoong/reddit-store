He's not worried because he intends for this to be all on you.\n\n>\"Here's the problem my boyfriend has bought 2 cars since me having to leave my job\" \"I asked him does he even know when each bill is payed and how when they are paid each month, he couldn't answer.\"\n\nWhat good reason could he possibly have to buy not 1 but 2 cars in less than a year after you've already dropped down to just his income? Here is demonstrating that he continues to be bad with money, which is only going to cause greater consequences now that you'll soon have another child. He also has no knowledge of how to run the household. If this is beneficial to both of you, so be it. But it's clearly not and him not knowing these important things shows you that you cannot rely on him in this aspect, especially now that you've come to a time where you would need to.\n\n>\"that id have the same mental and physical load as if he wasn't around. He left yesterday and I haven't heard from him since our fight\"\n\nIt's clear because it's apparent that he brings absolutely nothing to the table.
