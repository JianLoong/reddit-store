I, 28F, have a daughter, Haille, who is almost seven. She is very close with her cousin, Laina, who is about a year older than her, Laina is my older sisters child.\n\nLaina has a handful of allergies, including milk and chicken, hazelnuts, peanuts & almonds. Plus, she has celiac disease. (for those who are unaware, that\u2019s like an allergy to gluten) Because of this, I try my very best to accommodate my niece whenever she comes over. By \u201caccommodate\u201d I mean that I just make a gluten, dairy and nut and chicken free meals for everyone present in the household at that moment.\n\nMy daughter, unfortunately, hates whenever I do that. And most things included in her diet just so happen to have at least one of those ingredients. I\u2019ve tried so so hard to make food she\u2018d like, but she\u2019s just too much of a picky eater.\n\nSo when Laina came over for a sleepover last night, I had tried to make a dinner that meets her needs, but also something that Haille is willing to eat. I made rice with broccoli and beef, sided with vegan mashed potatoes & a chocolate cake. All allergen free. I thought this was a smart move, because Haille likes broccoli and mashed potatoes, but she HATED the version I made. I already had a headache, so while Laina was eating, I ordered McDonald\u2019s for Haille. \n\nI thought I was in the clear, but my sister called me the next day saying that I\u2019m a huge AH and that her daughter shouldn\u2019t have to eat a proper meal, while my daughter gets to have junk food. I defended myself, saying that my daughters a picky eater, and I had a headache and that Laina seemed to enjoy the meal I made so it was fine. She said that I could\u2019ve gotten something for Laina, then I reminded her that her choices would be extremely limited.\n\n She then said that I\u2019m a shitty hostess and that I wont be trusted with her daughter again.

Your sis seems super harsh given that you made a meal for her including a yummy cake! Yeah your daughter probably played you but sometimes it's all too much. If you did this all the time the yeah you'd be the asshole but just a once off- I think you deserve a break tbh", "Honestly, you did the best you can to accommodate everyone and make sure that all kids have eaten. I can\u2019t think of anything from McDonald\u2019s that would have been suitable for her to eat, unless you get them to package lettuce and tomatoes for her", "You accommodated her child - who has allergies and intolerances. She cannot eat most prepared foods. \n\nYou accommodated your daughter. She likes prepared foods. \n\nThe child with intolerances was unhappy because her difference was highlighted. \n\nChild with intolerances will have this experience MANY times in her life and it will continue to suck every time. \n\nBoth children were fed.\n\nNTA", "I am going to say NTA.  You cannot help that your niece has a limited diet because of her allergies.  McD\u2019s has milk/gluten in almost everything they offer.  You were doing your best to feed the entire family. \n\nCould you have grabbed an extra happy meal toy for your niece?", "YTA - look, I get it. Picky eaters are HARD WORK. But ordering junk food for one kid while the other just looks on is just mean. Your child wasn\u2019t in danger of starving - she played you. She could have eaten the mash and the broccoli, but instead whined until she got you to buy junk. You need to up your parents game or she\u2019ll end up as one of THOSE adults no one wants to invite anywhere because they\u2019re such a pain to eat with. \n\nSigned: the sister of an adult fussy eater.", "NTA, the language used by your sister raises some red flags for me as someone who knows moms who lie about allergies to make sure their kids eat healthy.\n\nI say good riddance, constantly having to walk on eggshells is stressful and now you can take that energy and put it into spending time with your daughter", "NTA my sister has Celiac and let me tell you that alone makes it a nightmare to find her anything to eat I can't imagine adding all of the other allergies on top of that one. Also there is no junk accommodation that you could have easily made as McDonald's has 0 gluten free options except for plain fries. Also you have no guarantee of cross contamination between any of her allergies.", "All the ppl saying 'yta' are unreal\ud83d\ude44. So does ur niece always run to her mom and throw a fit whenever she sees someone not eating what she's eating everywhere she goes? She and ur sister sound borderline entitled and both of them need to get over themselves.", "Nta your sister seems entitled", "NTA. You accommodated both children's diets. One cannot expect a child who does not have dietary restrictions and allergies, to stick to the diet of someone who does.", "If you truly COOK with all these allergens in mind, including CHOCOLATE CAKE, then absolutely NTA! For a child that age, I'm surprised your sister doesn't send food over when your daughter comes to your house. I'm an adult with food intolerances, and luckily my children didn't inherit them, but if they had, I would have sent food with them if they had sleepovers. Bless your heart for all your efforts. Maybe your sister was having a bad day. Let her chill, and maybe in a few days she'll apologize.", "Lol. Slightly surprised at all the judgements, but personally, NTA. If I am allergic to chicken, which I am, I do not expect my host to make their entire family eliminate chicken for the entire time I am there. Would I like my meal to have no chicken? Yes, but I am more than happy to just make my own food if needed. If they or their children want chicken, then they are welcome to it. \n\nIf I visit a family that is entirely vegan, then yes, I can expect to eat a vegan meal. But this is not the same thing. You made a special meal that your guest can eat. And you tried to get your daughter to eat. Those that are trying to tell you to make your daughter eat it anyway?\u2026.obviously you have never admitted to those nights where you just microwave chicken nuggets because your kid cried over the spaghetti. Your kids must be perfect! \n\nWhat probably happened, was her kid complained to their mom that they cannot have fast food. And possibly cried. Instead of using it as a teaching moment about food allergies and staying safe, or just that each child is different and does not have the same needs/rules, she takes the easy way out and blames you.", "Ohhhhh feelings were hurt! Are their stomachs connected? The allergic child is going to be in this position for the entirety of their existence will they expect everyone around them to avoid stuff they like for them what? Your sister has completely fucked a teachable moment instead teaching entitlement. Also what food from McDonald\u2019s can niece consume safely because if the problem is different food that would again mean your daughter having no choice! As for your menu. Just because you think the food was tasty does not mean your daughter enjoys reduced taste food and why should she. This whole attitude is what makes people resent restrictive diet people what goes into you daughters body is not your sisters concern. She should only be concerned with the fact you are not poisoning her child!", "NTA. \nI would like to know what on the McDonald\u2019s menu can Laina eat, ever since she\u2019s allergic to everything under the sun, apparently. The only thing that she would\u2019ve enjoyed would\u2019ve been the Happy Meal toy. \n\nThe only thing you did wrong here, mama, was make your daughter eat the same meal. With your daughter\u2019s portion, you should\u2019ve made it in the fashion that she likes. \n\nIf Laina had something to say about it, then you could\u2019ve informed her about her allergies and how she can become sick from eating foods with those items.", "Nta", "NTA - a once off in a long line of visits that you have accommodated for, this time you had your reasons and accommodated YOUR child\u2019s needs (you haven\u2019t mentioned that she\u2019s done this before but she\u2019s a kid, so to all the people saying you\u2019re enabling her, lol).

You accommodated the needs of your niece and your daughter. For the last time, people with dietary needs need to understand that sometimes they aren\u2019t going to get the same food/food that\u2019s as appealing as what others get. Your daughter has every right to be upset she\u2019s forced to eat neutered food all the time, and get McDonalds. I\u2019m so sick of people expecting others to tiptoe around their feelings by changing the way they EAT.", "NTA, you prepped a perfectly fine meal for your niece and took what your daughter wanted.  Your Sister is the AH and your niece for whining about it to her mother.  If people are going to complain when you do something nice for them then stop doing things for them.", "Nta, sorry but sometimes you got to take the easy way out. Your daughter NORMALLY eats your food when there are no allergen subs so she's clearly not just throwing a tantrum, she clearly doesn't like foods with those ingredients missing, obviously next time I would plan in advance but hindsight is always 20/20. Both kids were fed and happy it was your sister who's annoyed and what can you do about it I can't think of anything you could order that her daughter can safely eat.", "NTA\n\nIts not your daughters fault half the good foods in the world make your neice sick and she shouldn't be punished for it.", "NTA and what the f*** is the logic of depriving a child of less nourishing food?! (That said, I\u2019m not sure ordering McDonald\u2019s for your own child was the right way to go, but it\u2019s your child and your decision.)", "ESH. Did you daughter play you? Yes. Should you told her that your home is not a restaurant? Yes. Is it mean to have the other kid watch your daughter eat a bunch of stuff she never can even try? Yes. But: you are going out of your way to make your niece a proper meal. You fucked up once out of stress. No need for your sister to explode at you.", "I'm going with NTA here. You went out of your way to make sure that your niece was accommodated and had a safe, nutritious meal to eat. As someone with celiac disease and other numerous digestive disorders, I find it a bit surprising that your sister suggested you picking up fast food for your niece. If you are in the US, nothing at McDonald's is gluten free, not even the fries. And even if there was a gluten free option, fast food places often cross contaminate and she could still get very sick. (I've been there, done that.) Not to mention all of her other allergies. Cooking a meal at home for her was the safest option for her. \n\nI don't believe that buying your daughter fast food was the best option from a parenting perspective. There's a possibility that your daughter may \"hate\" all of the foods you make for your niece in the future in an attempt to get you to buy fast food again, and it sets a precedent that she can whine about the taste of the food and you'll buy her something else. This isn't a good habit to start. At the same time, I do understand the fact that you had a headache and wanted to make sure your kid ate something even if it wasn't what you cooked.", "The food you made sounds delicious and healthy. Honestly it sounds kind of less like your daughter hates the food and more that she hates that you're going to the effort of making something 'special' for someone else. And yeah, you could have got something for Laina - yes it would have been from a very limited selection but that's not really the point, the point is so she would feel included. So reluctantly YTA (not a huge one because you did go to a big effort to cook specially) but there's bigger issues going on here", "One kid got normal food, and the other kid got restaurant food. Remember; for kids, fast food like McDonalds is the *extra special* tasty food that you only get on special occasions.\n\nFor all intents and purposes, Laina was the guest, but watched her cousin get special treat without her. Yes, that is poor hostess behavior and I don't agree with the lesson it teaches your daughter at all.\n\nI understand you were tired, but I'm sorry, this was still a YTA thing to do.", "I'm gonna say YTA. I was an extremely picky eater and I get it, mealtimes are tough. I just think it's really mean towards her cousin to get one child McDonald's. Also how can she hate the broccoli, rice and checking you made? Those are already GF/dairy free. See how she reacts if you divide the mash in two bowls, vegan and regular and check if your daughter tastes a difference, because I suspect it's more about the effort and control than the actual food. Work with her gently on the picky eating it'll be a favour for later in life.", "NTA, I would say good riddance to the cousin. Life is not about accommodating her food issues and the earlier she learns that the better.", "Yta, your daughter can make-do with the nice meal you made while her cousin was visiting. It's the polite thing to do and good to yea h your daughter that. I'm also sure it made the other child feel terrible.", "YTA especially to your daughter.  You're enabling her behaviour.", "YTA\\~ ignoring the food but WHY is your child acting like this? I would teach your daughter something.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"By \u201caccommodate\u201d I mean that I just make a gluten, dairy and nut and chicken free meals for everyone present in the household at that moment.\" .. Why don't you make something extra for her. Forcing everybody else to eat her diet is an AH move.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She then said that I\u2019m a shitty hostess and that I wont be trusted with her daughter again.\" ..

And you do know that you can just order gluten free / vegan burgers at another shop right? You couldve ordered somewhere different so both had a nice burger but to give one broccoli and the other one a Burger or nuggets? I understand where you are coming from but that was not the right solution", "YTA. Look I get it, sometimes when everything is getting too much it\u2019s easier to pick your battles. But I don\u2019t think you chose the right battle here. \n\nYour daughter had options on her plate. She could have just eaten the broccoli and beef rice meal without the mash side. She wasn\u2019t going to starve missing one side of a whole meal. You are teaching your daughter that if she fusses enough about not liking the food you make (even if she likes parts of it) you will eventually cave and get her what she wants. Do you know what I do when my son didn\u2019t like parts of his meal? I tell him that it was okay if he couldn\u2019t eat the whole thing, just eat what you like and push the rest to the side. He\u2019s only a year older than your daughter. \n\nYou also were a terrible host by ordering junk food KNOWING your niece couldn\u2019t have any, that is a really shitty thing to do to a child who is supposed to be a guest in your home. I bet you really upset your niece, so much so that she held onto that feeling until she was back with mum. \n\nYou owe your sister and niece an apology. You also need to teach your daughter a little empathy with her cousins dietary needs, she may be picky but she needs to learn that sometimes we can\u2019t eat exactly what we want when it can make a person we care about ill.", "YTA \n\nYour daughter is 6 going on 7 and she\u2019s already manipulating you.", "YTA.   Not a HUGE asshole, but that was assholish and I can only imagine how your niece felt.   It's not the quality of the food you prepared for her, which sounds very nice.  It's that kids that age are VERY sensitive to perceived favoritism .   It's not about who got what, it's about \"Does aunty hate me?\"     \n\n\nSince you KNOW your child is picky, and you invited a child with serious medical issues to dinner, an acceptable solution would be making broccoli and mashed taters the way your daughter likes it, which wouldn't have been hard at all (divide the two boiled potatoes into separate bowls, mash and prepare accordingly).", "YTA, i get not making a special mashed potatoes, but can't you put a few broccoli side and make it the way the daughter wants?\n\nOrdering food for your daughter and letting her eat it in front of someone else is cruel, especially someone who would love to eat it but can't", "My daughter and I are both celiac. She is also on the spectrum so has food texture and taste issues. I'm going to go soft YTA. From a relationship standpoint you'd be best to offer an apology to your niece. If your sister can calm down I'd recommend an evening where all four of you cook dinner together. These girls are not too young to learn how to cook. Pick something like the meal you made. Everyone can make each part the way they need/like. Talk about whatever each person is doing and why. Food preparation offers a wonderful opportunity for learning compassion and safety for other's needs AND learning food independence. It needn't be a chore for one person or a point of contention in the family.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. What can she get from McDonald\u2019s that won\u2019t trigger her allergies? And even that is a risk because OP doesn\u2019t know if the food prep areas are clean and not contaminated with chicken. \n\nI just believe OP should\u2019ve made her daughter\u2019s meals in the way she would\u2019ve preferred. If Laina had a problem with it, then OP should\u2019ve told her about her allergies and how she could get sick from eating those foods.", "Ya thinking of like a McDonalds menu, I don\u2019t know what the kid could have eaten that had no gluten, milk or chicken. I guess a pop? NTA OP.", "Thank you lol I feel like a crazy person reading these comments.

I was in no mood to tell her off at all, but that doesn\u2019t justify anything anyways.", "No, I\u2019m pretty sure the kid who everyone has to accommodate for will be the one not invited everywhere. Why should the daughter have to change you diet up in her own home just because of her cousins issues?", "I'm thinking the same about the allergies. McDonald's certifies nothing as gluten free except the coffee.  You can't even guarantee the burger patty hasn't been on the same surface as a breaded chicken patty. It's not a regular restaurant where you can do anything about cross contamination or ask for an accommodation (plain burger that hasn't been anywhere near a breaded chicken patty)\nLooking at that list of allergies the mom should have been happy her kid didn't get any and should have been upset if they did have some.", "McDonald's doesn't certify their fries as gluten free and specifically says on their website they are not a gluten free option since they are sometimes cooked in a shared fryer depending on location.  So if a hashbrown was cooked in that same oil then none of the fries can be considered gluten free anymore.", "I never realized how hard it was until I travelled with a friend who is GF and watched her having to check every single menu.", "Throw a fit? You mean like OPs daughter did about the food that was offered to her? That kind of fit?", "that's where I'm at, the McDonald's is not the issue here!

You'll just have to make yourself some plain toast.\"", "> Why should the daughter have to change you diet up in her own home just because of her cousins issues?\n\nBecause you invited them into your own, and that is what it means to be a good host.\n\nAn equal question would be \"Why would you invite over a kid who whines rudely about food\", and \"Why would you be friends with someone who is unwilling to understand that legitimate medical issues need to be taken seriously and so clearly doesn't care one wit about your health?\"", "I agree with this, I have coeliac disease there is plenty of times where people have eaten fast food in front of me that I can\u2019t eat, but do I care? No. I don\u2019t expect people to walk around on eggshells around me over dietary need. At the end of the day life is unfair.", "Wow.  Why wouldn\u2019t you make accommodations for someone with an allergy (that is possibly life threatening)? I certainly wouldn\u2019t not invite someone for that. It\u2019s completely different than a picky eater. \n\nYou sound awful, u/hdhddjnfndnd\n\n\nEdit: grammar", "The cousin is not a picky eater, the cousin will legitimately get I\u2019ll if her diet is not followed.  Your daughter is pushing your boundaries, and being successful.  Nip that in the bud, you\u2019re creating a monster.  If daughter doesn\u2019t like what you make, she gets a cheese sandwich or a bowl of cereal.", "What on earth? I would much, MUCH rather invite someone with severe food allergies over for dinner than someone who kicks up a huge fuss if things aren\u2019t exactly to their liking. \n\nI can deal with cooking without chicken, dairy, nuts, or gluten. An adult who behaved one tenth as badly as OP\u2019s daughter, even in their own home, would not be getting any invitations from me. \n\nOP\u2019s daughter needs to learn that, every now and then, somebody else\u2019s needs are going to be more important than her own wants. Not killing your guests by sending them into anaphylactic shock is more important than accommodating a preference for mashed potatoes made THIS way instead of THAT way. \n\nThat said, OP knows this is an issue. She either needs to spend some time with her kid trying out foods that will be safe for her cousin, or make sure that if Laina is coming over, there\u2019s food in the fridge that Haille is willing to eat that won\u2019t endanger Laina. It doesn\u2019t need to be a nutritionally complete meal, just something that Haille can get out, that isn\u2019t junk food, and that has enough calories to tide her over.", "Oh wow see we didn't even know that she was recently diagnosed last year after years of stomach pain that no doctor could give us an answer for.

No, a good host gives an alternative, which OP did.", "Are you 8 years old too? lmao", "Lol what\u2019s awful is going to someone\u2019s house and whining that someone is eating something that you know for a fact you can\u2019t eat", "Lol it was the cousin who kicked up a big fuss when she didn\u2019t get any McDonald\u2019s even though she is very aware she can\u2019t eat it. She is just as spoiled and bratty as your are making OPs daughter out to be. And her daughter is in her own home and shouldn\u2019t have her diet changed to accommodate someone else", "The fries should be gluten free but because it's a fast food place they don't really have the time to keep dedicated fryers. Or the ability to do so.  So if the morning hash browns were cooked in that oil, any fries cooked are now not gluten free until the oil is changed. \n\n  Most restaurants I've worked at keep the fries in their own fryer but even some smaller ones don't. So chicken nuggets/strips, anything breaded except breaded fish will just get tossed into the same oil which then negates it being gluten free anymore.

The ultimatum of you being \u201cunsafe,\u201d when you are just a mildly sucky pushover IN THIS ONE INSTANCE, is quite weird. This makes me think she\u2019s probably bringing in some external things, plus has poor judgment, or that info is missing here and it might be worth trying to work out what is going on with her.\n\nLaina - a small pass for Laina. I may be misjudging Laina because she may have only mentioned this in passing rather than complaining about it, and it was your sister who exploded - it\u2019s possible that she was just commenting to her mother on her cousin\u2019s wretched behavior, which would be only natural. \n\nHaille - hopefully I don\u2019t have to explain in too much detail what is disappointing about Haille\u2019s choices here, but again, at seven years old a \u201cpicky eater\u201d can hold herself to the minimum standard of behavior of the four-year-old vegans. You aren\u2019t doing her any favors with this and her behavior is genuinely assholish. In addition to the poor behavior of not eating her dinner or quietly fixing herself cereal, it is very immature and borderline malicious of her to throw this particular kind of tantrum in front of her cousin, who ate the food politely. There is definitely a family weirdness with food that ought to be addressed at some point.\n\nOP - sorry, but you did handle this all pretty badly: at the bare minimum, get the damn guest child some apple slices and a juice box, or a happy meal and you eat the meal and she gets the toy, but BETTER YET, your perfectly capable child should have made herself a jam sandwich or chosen several better pathways of behavior before you picked up the phone to call McDonalds (!!!) and ideally you\u2019d have been the adult here at all of those pathways. I think you\u2019ve probably gathered in the comments that you were supposed to be the adult here and dropped the ball. It was badly managed all around when it was your job to be the manager. \n\nHowever, it\u2019s something that everyone can grow from, and better do it sooner rather than later, because at the moment NONE of you would be welcome houseguests, and there\u2019s still a decent chance to save the kids.\n\nBest of luck, and while it might sound harsh to say that your kid sucks for example, there isn\u2019t anything here you can\u2019t learn and do better from. It\u2019s a small thing that has conveniently shown you that you have to do some adulting work around food in your house.", "YTA. Way to raise your kid to be an entitled AH. you picked stuff you even said yourself she would like too (it all sounded great) but she didn't get her way, whined about it, and you rewarded that with McDonalds. She also needs to learn that her cousin has to eat certain foods so she doesn't get sick and this is something nice she can do for her cousin.\n\nEdit: I'm seeing OP's comments about how daughter doesn't like the allergy free substitutes. Is there a way to separate for example the mashed potatoes before you add the butter/whatever and make a separate portion for niece? Or offer your daughter some  kind of condiment at the table?", "NTA... This sounds like it was a one time thing because you were stressed out about work and had a headache. It sucks that your sister is that uptight that she can't understand  as a parent that this was just not the time for you to get into a  battle of wills with your daughter over what she's going to eat.  I don't even know what you can say at this point.  I think your sister is being slightly unreasonable here.", "NTA.

You seem to cater to your niece and not your daughter.", "My daughter will literally only eat fruit, chicken nuggets and meatballs. But that just means literally everything we eat is either called chicken nuggets or meatballs. Steak for dinner? Here try this meatball. Fish night? Here\u2019s some chicken nuggets just like you like them!", "Nta. Sometimes us moms need a break. If you are constantly making meals for your niece that your daughter has to eat, then she can deal with seeing your daughter have junk food on occasion.", "Nta. Everyone shouldn't  have to suffer for one.", "NTA. Sister should be packing food for the child with multiple allergies. No way should you be making tailored meals for your niece and make everyone else eats it every time se comes over. Fuck that. If you're a terrible hostess, your sister is a terrible mother.

We are talking about 1 meal here, not a pattern of preferential treatment or discrimination or neglect of nutritional needs or health concerns.\n\nYou tried.

No.  Was it the massive injustice or complex-causing trauma some seem to be suggesting?  Also no.\n\nCut yourself some slack.

I couldn't imagine having to navigate through all that turmoil.", ">She said that I could\u2019ve gotten something for Laina\n\nI-N-F-O: what the hell could she eat from McDonald's with all of her allergies?\n\nNTA. Your sister and Laina are both in for a rude awakening if they expect everyone around Laina to fully adopt her diet whenever she's around. It sucks but that's life - it's not always fair.", "NTA. My son has multiple food allergies so I understand where your sister is coming from. However, it sounds like you made a really nice meal for Laina. I would have been so grateful because it\u2019s rare that people in my family remember all my son\u2019s allergies and go through the extra effort to make food he can eat.", "In one of your replies, you mention that they invited themselves over (for a sleepover)?  So, you cooked an entire dinner when you weren't in the mood to do so and were stressed from work?\n\nNTA.\n\nYes, you need to teach your daughter to be a good hostess, but your sister needs to do a little bit more work to be a better guest.  I don't have kids, but if I were to, say, drop off my spouse for a last-minute dinner at someone else's house, I would send them with a casserole or something.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t a typically hosting situation. This is a family relationship where your daughters regularly hang out. So, home rules apply. Your have an obligation to serve your niece safe food. You do NOT have the obligation to  provide a list of safe fast food restaurants\u2014Your sister does. \n\nYour sister has flipped the script here: her daughter is the one with the necessary medical accommodation and the restricted diet. Part of your sister\u2019s obligation as a parent is to teach your daughter the harsh but necessary lesson that she can\u2019t rely on being able to eat what other people eat. Yes, most of the time, that means you should be preparing inclusive meals\u2014But it\u2019s also an important reminder for your niece that she doesn\u2019t share the same diet with your daughter. \n\nYour niece could safely eat the meal that you prepared. She likes the food. Your daughter is a fussy eater who doesn\u2019t ever like the accommodating food.

That explains a lot more about her completely disproportionate response than her being upset over your parenting choices for one meal.", "NTA.", "My stepmom is an extremely picky eater and she eats the bare minimum to survive. When we're going out with them, she never demands that we eat like her! That would be laughable. The rest of us can find  stuff easier since we're omnivores.

Like, she tries to de-emphasize the differences when she can, but you can't always control other people's reactions. If she could get Hailee to eat the meal without comment or complaint, everything's good, but since she couldn't it was either Laina sees Hailee eat a \"fun\" meal that she can have (which sucks) or Laina sees Hailee giving the meal and possibly her the stink eye and sulking *knowing that it's because of her*. The second one sucks too, but the first one is something that Laina's probably going to have to deal with regularly.
