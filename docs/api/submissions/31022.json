I have three children 25F, 23M, 17M. Over the past few years my 23m son has been genuinely upset that I will not transfer my GI BILL to him. Those unfamiliar with the military, service members are able to transfer their education benefits to their spouse or children after serving a certain amount of time. However, I accidentally exhausted my GI BILL.  My daughter and oldest son never really showed interest in college, nor were my sons grades of the best.  Once my son moved out after HS our communication was minimal. Our relationship prior to him moving out was alao strained. As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.  Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor. \n\n It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him.

However, I accidentally exhausted my GI BILL.  My daughter and oldest son never really showed interest in college, nor were my sons grades of the best.  Once my son moved out after HS our communication was minimal. Our relationship prior to him moving out was alao strained. As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it, but I also explained it wasn't intentional, and was unaware that when you take one class they doc you a full semester. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.    Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor. \n\n It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him.

GI Bill is irrelevant, you should have been saving out of pocket. That's the only thing that really stood out to me in your post, that you think it's perfectly acceptable for a parent with a good job to not save for college. Your son is correct that per FAFSA, you have screwed him.", "NTA but why were you even using your GI bill instead of Tuition Assistance for a single class a term?", "Depends. Do you love him no matter what and want the best for him? Or could you take it or leave it?", "NTA. HE MADE HIS CHOICE VERY CLEAR.", "Career Army (30 plus years) here. The GI Bill was meant for YOU and also gave you the option to transfer it to family if you chose to.

But once you\u2019re gone, the survivors are the ones that have to deal with the fallout for the rest of their lives and it could be terrible for them because you wanted to punish bad behavior of your son.\n\nIf you decide to do that please consider a handwritten letter explaining why you made that choice.\n\nThe healthcare is also your decision. There is no law that requires coverage of adult children unless, of course, it was agreed to in a legal court or something.

Again, that is your decision.\n\nGood luck, OP.", "Recently retired military here. \n\nNTA. I'm sorry you're going through this with your son. I know it's painful.

You know full well the difficulties of life, you had to buckle the 'f' up, pull up the big girl pants and better your circumstances.

Life doesn't always work out that way. I'm using ALL my money for my own degrees. My son had to join to get his own money. Life is tough, it doesn't doesn't care about your feelings or hardships.

It is not a parent\u2019s job to get walked all over or constantly placate a toxic person, and sometimes their kids grow up to be assholes or entitled despite the parent\u2019s best efforts. \n\nThis kid is very clearly only interested in their mom\u2019s money, and the mom was well within her rights to use her GI bill to educate herself in order to advance in the army and better be able to support her family.", "If you promised or told him you'd help. And now aren't yeah you're a dick if not then no you're not. But like... Have you actually tried to help him with the education.

My parents couldn't, so I went to community college and worked full time, and it took a lot longer for me to get a degree than it did other people but I also was gaining work and life experience. When other kids were in dorms I was in my own apartment. I was learning to budget and pay bills while a lot of my friends were using their parents' credit card. Sorry your son blames you for his life not being what he wishes it were. I hope he grows up one day.", "NTA\n\nI have no idea why he thinks he\u2019s entitled to your GI Bill benefits.

Was it buying things? Did you substitute love and quality time for tangible items? You said you provided everything needed for *survival* (food, shelter, clothing)......I'm asking because children learn from their parents, and if love was expressed by gifts, security, etc then this is how your son expects love to be expressed, at least by you. So by not providing that then you're essentially *not* showing love, as he's been taught. And by not taking the time, as difficult as it may be, to truly understand where he is coming from is just a testament to how defensive you are as a parent and not willing to learn.

I mean the inky time is if he wants to borrow money.    \n\nAnother part of the problem is he absolutely won't accept my health problems. I have MS. I ALSO HAD A TRIPLE BYPASS.

It's about OP's will and life instance and whether she should feel morally compelled to leave them to a son who has terminated their relationship. That's what this is about. \n\nOP is *an* asshole, pretty clearly. She seems to be a parent who really came up short. I totally believe her son has valid justifications for how he feels and for cutting of contact with her. But also if someone has cut all contact with you and has no relationship with you, it seems logical that you would not include them in your will, or have them as a beneficiary. I certainly don't expect any acknowledgement in the wills of my terribly racist family members that I have no contact with.\n\nSurely - if people want to litigate a different question than the one OP posed, if they want to argue if OP sucks as a parent, I would say yes. But the format is to judge what we're asked to judge. Not to reframe what the OP is asking so that we can judge them on the basis of whatever moral failures we see in their stories. And OP is asking if - with everything as a background information - she would be wrong to disinherit her son who has terminated their relationship.\n\nI can't see how she would be. I can't imagine he expects not to be. You can't end a relationship - even for valid cause - and still expect to be the beneficiary of the that relationship. It just doesn't make sense.\n\nCriticize OP all you like -- but this is the top comment because it's most commonly seen as the correct answer to the question being posed.
