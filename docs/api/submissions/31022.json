I have three children 25F, 23M, 17M. Over the past few years my 23m son has been genuinely upset that I will not transfer my GI BILL to him. Those unfamiliar with the military, service members are able to transfer their education benefits to their spouse or children after serving a certain amount of time. However, I accidentally exhausted my GI BILL.  My daughter and oldest son never really showed interest in college, nor were my sons grades of the best.  Once my son moved out after HS our communication was minimal. Our relationship prior to him moving out was alao strained. As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it, but I also explained it wasn't intentional, and was unaware that when you take one class they doc you a full semester. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.    Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor. \n\n It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him.

As a parent, I hope I am not the only one to say my son and I just did not get along and could never seem to connect as he got older and got worse the older he got. About two years ago of him going no contact he messeged me, not to ask how we were doing or anything, but straight to the point that its my fault that he no longer qualifies for grants due to our incomes combined and why I did not transfer my GI BILL to him. I Informed him that I had exhausted it and that he is more than welcome to speak to a recruiter.  He then said I should have set 50-100 aside each month to pay for his college. At this point I call him entitled and told him I don't owe him anything once he moved out of my household.  (Summerized conversation) We go no contact again for a little over a year and recently another messege straight to the point asking how I exhausted my GI BILL, again told him he can go see a recruiter about it, but I also explained it wasn't intentional, and was unaware that when you take one class they doc you a full semester. Non,the less this conversation still ended on that I should be responsible for his college.    Let it be clear, before I joined the army I was a single parent having my first child at 17, living in poverty making less that 11k a year. I joined the army at 25, paying for college tuition out of pocket was never an option. I did the best I could as a parent and I know I would never win mother of the year. In both conversation I did apologize for the mistakes I made along the way. As, it's clear they bother him, but this conversation ended with him stating he does not view me as his mother and blocked me on everything. He made it clear to his sister that he does not view me as his mother and I am nothing more than an egg donor. \n\n It is time for me to update my life insurance and do a will and I am considering excluding him.

Just because something IS an option, doesn't mean it is being used.", "Idk what terrible even means in this whole scenario. Saying a relationship is over and going no contact, means a relationship is over to me. I genuinely don't understand why if something warranted that scorched earth reaction, multiple requests for financial support for college follow. It's not money to stay housed. It's not medical support. It's 'I want free college'. I can't relate, because my threshold for cutting off relationships is clearly not the same as OPs son, and my threshold for demanding support as an adult is also clearly not the same. That's fine. I'm not submitting her for mother of the year here. I just think a dude in his twenties needs to figure out another option than staying mad at his mom for not setting him up for better success in adulthood.", "Oof making it about intelligence now? Where were her good parents that she should have had when she was a child having children, since her grown son is still a child in your eyes? He is in a better position as a young adult than she was. He can figure it out, without free college and without an inheritance.", "Yeah, I hate the attitudes with college (as we see on this thread lol). People act like getting a degree sets them for life and we see every single day how much that is not the case. I thought that way at 17/18 but now at 26 I can look back and have so much more respect for people that didn\u2019t go and are doing great.", "I don\u2019t even think YOU understand what you are saying lol. You\u2019re making one argument that isn\u2019t true, and then backing it up by more of your personal thoughts that is contradicting your original statement. I\u2019m just pointing out that your argument sucks if you think this person working hard to carve their way in life is luck. \n\nNot everyone wants to live their entire life as a victim to a system of high education costs, some people find different ways to go about things and find happiness with their success. You think fees need to go down? Cool, join the party of most of America that thinks that. Your personal opinion on something is not going to change what is reality NOW and that people do the best they can with what they have.", "I don\u2019t follow your logic. Because the son is an adult he understands how things work and therefore his situation is his own fault, but it\u2019s not the mom\u2019s fault for not understanding how things work despite being an adult? Talk about double standards.", "Turns out there isn't a magic switch when you hit 18 that downloads all the things adults need to do to your brain. We have these things called \"parents\" which are supposed to prepare us for putting on our big boy pants and taking responsibility.", "That absolutely doesn't work. Either you are a beneficiary or you or not. And as a beneficiary, it is your legally protected right to challenge a will. This also helps protect elders against elder abuse and estate fraud.", "Yes, but I was responding to the \u201cnothing else is reliant at that age\u201d which is incorrect in that case, even if for some it is irrelevant.", "Because OP turned out so great? Does the world *owe* you anything? No. It\u2019s a cruel place. I am aware of that. But it\u2019s also a place where I can call out an asshole when I see one. OPs son is not her first child. Its her *second*. And yes I **will** make it about intelligence because uneducated people have more kids. **statistically**", "Hmmm OP seemed to indicate having been 17 when the oldest child was born, 19 when the son in question was born.\nSo perhaps based on this very argument OP also wasn't hit with some magical switch to make them understand adulting and being a model parent? And perhaps would have needed some extra support to help her avoid some mistakes?\n\nOr is the son only one who should gave gotten more support and help, from a parent he has cut ties from and seemingly only wants to benefit from now?", "It depends on the jurisdiction. In my state they are disfavored but not completely invalid.\n\nYour point about prevention of elder abuse is an important one. Some disinheritances are done for good reason. Others are the result of fraud or undue influence."]}
