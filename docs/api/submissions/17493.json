Your sister is being ridiculous. NTA. You don't want a flower girl. End of discussion.\n\nRegardless of if you did, though - a 15 year old is too old to be a flower girl and just because Luna and your sister want to relive experiences that were possible at a younger age doesn't mean anyone else has to humor them.

As I trans woman myself I will say that the fact that you're including her in the Bachelorette festivities is good enough. She doesn't need to be the flower girl to be one of the girls in this occasion. You are already letting her go to the girls only part of the wedding and that's what likely matters most to her.

As the proposal and wedding planning happened quickly, I\u2019m not having a huge wedding party, just a MOH and BM, a ring bearer, and my uncle officiating. My maid of honor is my best friend \u201cKyra\u201d (27F), the best man is my BIL. We\u2019re having the wedding at the local botanical garden. I\u2019m just giving all these details for context\u2026it\u2019s a very low key wedding and hardly the event of the decade.\n\nNow, once I confirmed with everyone and announced my wedding party in the family group chat (the one for my side of the family, to be clear), my sister \u201cBlair\u201d (38F) started kicking up a fuss. \n\nSome background on Blair: she has one daughter, \u201cLuna\u201d (15MtF). Luna came out at the end of 8th grade, and the family has been overall supportive. In the past, Blair has shared that Luna feels she missed out on a lot of childhood milestones by not coming out until she was 14. Luna never got to play dress up, wear sparkly tutus, play dolls, or any of the usual things young girls do.\n\nAnyway, Blair starts kicking up a stink that Luna isn\u2019t in the wedding party. I told her kindly that I\u2019m not having any bridesmaids/ junior bridesmaids, just Kyra as my MOH. I assured her that Luna would be invited to the bachelorette (it\u2019ll be teen-friendly, just a day trip to a nearby historic town/ getting our nails done). Blair then revealed that she wants Luna to be my flower girl.\n\nIn the chat, I reminded Blair that a flower girl is usually preschool age, and that high school is way too old. Plus, Luna is six feet and very obviously in high school, she\u2019d look silly in a frilly flower girl dress even if they found one in an adult size. Blair launched into a complaint about how I made my nephew (other sister\u2019s son) the ring bearer, but he\u2019s 4 so it made sense.\n\nUnfortunately, because this happened in the family GC, every relative is in my ear with their opinions. Most people side with me, but my cousin and her partner think it wouldn\u2019t hurt to let Luna do it. I love my niece and don\u2019t want to take away her chance to shine, but at the same time, it just doesn\u2019t seem reasonable.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. Does Luna know about any of this? I can't imagine many 15 year old's would be anything other than mortified by their mother doing this. It makes sense that she wants to have girly experiences, but it's unfair to ask you to make your wedding her chance to shine.", "I ended up having flower girls at my wedding after my family ganged up on me and reduced me to hysterical sobbing and I caved to be left alone. \n\nAnd they wonder why I'm too firm with them sometimes now . . .", "NTA.  It's your day, your wedding, your party.  You get to do you.  The family is challenged in many ways.  On a positive note, I do love that you support Luna as much as you do.", "NTA but there's no time limit on flower girls. There have been flower men and flower dogs. It really doesn't matter.", "At the end of the day it is your wedding and your decisions of what you want vs don\u2019t want. If they can\u2019t respect those decisions then they\u2019re the assholes not you", "That's my question! It sounds like all of this is coming from the sister, but I'm curious if Luna themselves would even want this. Even if they did, OP is NTA for saying no, but it would seem like an opportunity to talk to Luna directly.", "Love that idea! Once things have cooled off, I\u2019ll see what Blair thinks. I wouldn\u2019t mind paying for it.", "I was meant to be my cousin's flowergirl for her wedding at the age of 13. I was the only young girl she knew at the time. Part of me felt awkward about being an older-than-usual flowergirl and having to walk and dance with a kid that was aged 5 as the ring bearer. \n\nI had gotten the dress and felt even more awkward and stupid in the damn thing. I felt like I looked like Little Bo Peep. Just needed a lamb!\n\nIn the end, the wedding didn't happen and I did a happy dance that I wasn't being forced to wear a weird dress for hours. \n\nI survived having not been a flower girl (been a bridesmaid twice.)", "No, I haven\u2019t. Luna is pretty shy and doesn\u2019t like to express her opinions. She could be mortified that her mom is doing this, idk, but she\u2019d never say anything either way.", "At 15, she is probably excited to be going to a bachelorette!! She\u2019s being invited to the adult celebration, vs the role of a preschooler.", "NTA this 100 percent", "Plus you could also do a girls day and help her shop for a gorgeous dress to wear for that day. Even let her try a few over the top dresses on.\n\nBut find her something elegant and beautiful", "You got luckier than me. I was my cousin's flowergirl at 14. The dress was awful and I felt so awkward and my mom wouldn't let me say no. I know it was a sign of love from my cousin (we are close) but I felt so awkward.", "I don't know your relationship with them, but seems like it might be an opportunity for discussion, especially as this seems to be coming only from your sister, not Luna themselves. Either way, NTA, 15 is WAY to old to be a flower girl and it's your wedding so you get to decide all the things.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe reach out to Luna just to say hey, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re coming to the bachelorette, and maybe a few texts here and there, to let her know you\u2019re there for her?  It appears her mom is overbearing and if she\u2019s shy/quiet, she may need someone in the future that\u2019s chill."]}
