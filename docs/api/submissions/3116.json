We have 2 cats oland 2 litter trays one in the bathroom one in the living room\n\nEdit due to more info NAH you n room mate need to figure out what to do going forward", "YTA. Your roommate is wrong about them only needing one box, but I don't think putting the litterbox in the living room is very nice. Maybe the bathroom? Some more out of the way corner? I don't care how often you clean it, it is still going to smell at times.", "YTA.  \nIf it is your cats they are your problem.   \nSInce it isnt your roommates cats they shouldbt be inconvinienced by them. Two litterboxes are plenty and if you make sure to empty them regurarly and change the sand often there isnt a reason why you couldnt have them in your bedroom.", "Sorry but YTA. I\u2019ve had cats my whole life so this isn\u2019t coming from an anti-cat place. It\u2019s coming from a be-a-good-roommate place. \n\nIf you talked to your roommates about getting a second cat but you did not include the litterbox factor in those discussions, you didn\u2019t do your due diligence to make sure adding another pet to the household was acceptable. Your roommates should have been given ALL relevant information before deciding whether or not they were cool with it. Surprising them with a litterbox in the living room is not good roommate behavior, especially since you\u2019re not the primary/original tenant. \n\nFind another place for the third litterbox or maybe just see how they get on with two for now\u2014maybe you\u2019ll get lucky. (I am fully aware of the n+1 practice, but I also know from experience that not all cats are fussed about sharing so you may as well try it first.) Try some more creative problem solving and think up better solutions. But it\u2019s not fair to just tell your roommates you\u2019re keeping the box in the main common area of the home and you will refuse to move it.", "YTA. I never ever seen a household where the litterbox was standing in the living room??? Maybe it is a cultural thing over there that this is acceptable, but here people usually put it in the bathroom. The living room is a no go for litterboxes... it smells and you cannot just put a litterbox there even when your roommate agreed to another cat", "You do definitely need three boxes, but the way you have responded to a lot of comments makes you sound like a massive AH. You seem hellbent on avoiding reasonable discussion. \n\nI have two cats. When one of them in particular uses the litter tray, it stinks. I do have a tray in my living room because me and my partner both agreed on it. However, I have built furniture that disguises the litter tray. \n\nYes your lease is pet friendly, but you're still sharing the space with someone else, and you need to be open to discussions about shared spaces. You need to learn compromise. If something of hers was able to fall into the tray, then you clearly have an open top one. A minor compromise would be to get a covered tray. A better person would hide the tray inside furniture (you can even buy furniture specifically for this). \n\nYou also need to remember that pet friendly leases don't just mean it's a free for all. If your roommate decides that the presence of the cats are negatively impacting her living space that she shares with you, she can contact the landlord and dispute it. \n\nYou also said \"generally\" good at emptying the tray. In a shared space, I'd argue that generally isn't good enough.\n\n*Edited for missed word", "Yes, I have two cats and they're absolutely fine with 1 litter box. Clean the one daily and take the cats toilet out of the communal space.", "YTA. Litter boxes stink, don\u2019t keep them in the living room others have to share with you.", "YTA. A litter box in the living area? Crikey, that\u2019s gross.\n\nI love cats and mine like to have a litter box each, but I wouldn\u2019t put them in a living room, especially if people eat, drink or work from home in the living room.", "YTA for putting a litter box in the living room. They should go to your room and to other stinky rooms like bathrooms, but not in other living areas where other people roam.\n\nI've had cats, too. They often bring the stuff from the litter boxes on the floor with their paws, I would never accept that in a living room. Also, the odor catching boxes stink, too, but you just get used to it and don't understand what other people mean when they say the room stinks. So don't put it in the living room. Just stink up your own room and bathrooms.", "YTA. You basically put your cat\u2019s bathroom in the middle of a shared living space without asking the other people who live there. Did you discuss this in advance? When you talked about getting a second cat (I assume you warned your roommate that a new cat would be coming? And hopefully asked if that was okay?) did you mention that another littler box was necessary and talk about where it would go? You don\u2019t live there alone, and additions to shared spaces need to be discussed. I love cats, but would not be okay if their box of poop was suddenly added to my living room.", "YTA-this is your problem not your roommates.

Going to say YTA.", "YTA I am a cat lover, I have a lot of cats. Leaving a litterbox in the living room is ok, but only if it's a covered one. My living room one looks like an end table. It has a filter in the top and a private entrance. Be kind to your roommate, get a covered litterbox with a filter for the living room. Plus, if you get a nice one, the cats can sit on top and look out the window. No one should risk their stuff falling into kitty litter, that's no fun.", "Yes, YTA. You don't put a box of poop in a shared living space without consulting your roommates. Two cats don't need 3-4 litter boxes anyway! One would be enough. Two would be fancy. More than that, imposed on other people, starts to become ridiculous.", "OP you seem to think that the fact the lease is pet friendly that you can do anything you want with your pets \"and if she doesn't like it she can move out\". Which is absolutely not the case. \n\nIf your roommate got a massive dog that started attacking your cats, I think you would see the limitations of the pet free-for-all all you seem to think a pet friendly lease implies. \n\nI'm not going to comment on the placement of the litter trays, as several already have, but from the way you have written this and your responses it's clear YTA. You have absolutely no regard for your roommate and are extremely confrontational. If you display even a fraction of what you have here to your roommate you would be an incredibly difficult to live with.", "YTA, you decided to get the second cat and it's on you to figure out their tiolet situation. But placing a litter box in the shared space is a no-no, unless discussed prior. If you want 3 litter boxes, place all of them into your own space.", "I have one litter box and have a 3000 square foot home and my box never smells because I clean it daily. Takes under 5 minutes and then on with my day.

Her ukulele can move lol", "YTA- I have 2 cats and one litter box out of the way in the laundry room.\nI didn't realise you needed more than one?\nAnd putting it in the living room is pretty anti-social.

YTA. Shared living spaces aren\u2019t a great place to store cat feces and urine.", "YTA. All you need is one, just clean it regularly. Besides it is disgusting that you want to keep it in the living room.", "NAH it\u2019s tricky because you\u2019re the primary leaseholder but she lived there before. I have to ask though who would put things above a litter tray where a cat could knock things into it.

Roommate agreed to the second cat and litter boxes in seperate places is often a requirement when you have more than one cat (some cats are fine with boxes next to each other but others really aren't - if the trays are next to each other and one has just been used then the other cat may choose to go on the carpet or something than go in what it sees to be the same spot).", "Info: are they your cats or do you all share costs/responsibility?", "Yo could get a closed litterbox, that way there'll be no nasty accidents anymore and maybe your roommate will be more lenient.

When living with roommates you always gotta compromise. I this case I think the 2 litter boxes in your room are enough. Our cats also only have 2.", "NAH. Both of you are on the lease a primary. You discussed having a cat beforehand.  It is weird to have three litter boxes in your room. \n\nI had two cats that had to stay in my room constantly so I  had the litter boxes in my room despite being the main and longest resident at my old place. Those suckers eat up a lot of space so I understand why you don't want three in the room. \n\nIt doesn't sound like she's complaining of smell so that really plays no part in this whole thing. The issue at hand is you ignoring her request. If you truly ignore it flat out and find no way to compromise then yta.\n\nThat doesn't seem to be the case though since you have admitted in the thread you are willing to compromise. She asked you to move it because something of hers fell in which I agree is gross.  I don't like anything falling in my litter boxes either. \n\nIf there is no place else to put it and you want to keep all the boxes,  maybe just discuss with your roommate on whether a lid will work.  You can find those for dang near any cat box size.  Kitties get some privacy, and if rommies stuff falls again it'll just boink off the lid instead of landing directly in poop sand.\n\nGood luck OP", "Maybe you could get a box that has a lid for the one in the living room? I think NAH and agree there should be a box in the living room but maybe there can be a compromise?", "i have a hooded boxes it fell in because the door on it went back", "well the bathroom isn\u2019t really an option because it\u2019s small and the door is always closed they never go in there. the living room is huge, and it\u2019s a railroad style apartment so it\u2019s a long hallway into the kitchen and i do think it would be inappropriate for it to be in the kitchen and the hallway isn\u2019t an option isn\u2019t an option without it being in the way of walking. \n\ni feel that expecting all of the cats boxes to be in my bedroom just because i am the owner is unreasonable 1. they are HOUSE cats. all the boxes being in the bedroom defeats the purpose and reason of why they need multiple. she even likes to play with them while they are around and 2. it is not just her home.  while you are right it is going to smell sometimes and it is impossible for it to be scentless 100% of the time, again it\u2019s not only her home. the pets were discussed prior", "I'm with you on this one- I grew up in a two cats/one box house (wasn't in my control, I was a kid) and we cleaned it daily. Both housecats, no problems sharing. I have two cats now who have shared a single box since they arrived, no problems, clean out daily. Thankfully they're able to go outside where we are, which is where different circumstances and feline personalities need to be considered (which I can't do as I don't know her cats). But i would really dislike a litter box in the living room. They do smell, even if the housemates go nose blind. Surely there's some kind of utility room, or a triangular litter box that could go in a bathroom out of the way, and both humans just learn to leave the door ajar?", "i am 100% a PRIMARY tenant on this lease. she lived here first and needed me and the other person to sign with her because she can not afford this place alone. we report to a landlord. i pay my landlord not her. having the cats isn\u2019t a lease violation. \n\nim definitely willing to have a discussion with her about where she would like me to move it to but you\u2019re entirely mistaken.", "I have had cats my entire life and we currently have 3 sharing two litter boxes.

Why not put one in the kitchen, where you make your food! Why not put one in your bedroom where you sleep! \n\nLitter boxes are disgusting and I don't understand why people act as if it's normal to keep a tray of shit in their house.", "yes they were discussed and while i do not live alone,  she does not live alone neither. \n\ni did ask her where she would like me to move it and she gave me a smart ass answer. i am willing to come to a compromise and we could had discussed it then had she was not making smart remarks.. but keeping all 3 in my room really defeats the purpose.", "To be fair the recommendation is to have 1 litter box per cat + 1 extra. So 2 cats should have 3 litter boxes. \n\nIdeally each box should be in a different place. Cat want to scent everywhere in a home so having a litter box in each room reduces the chances of them peeing on blankets and stuff\n\nHowever this is something you discuss with the people you live with before you get a cat. Imo litter boxes, especially in public rooms should be covered to some degree to make sure nothing falls in it. Some cats won't use covered litter boxes but putting a small table over it works well (IKEA do a \u00a35 table that fits perfectly.)", "if anything having the boxes is to make sure they do not piss and shit on HER stuff as well. yes they are lazy kitties.", "That\u2019s really wrong from a medical and behavioural perspective.

You can make a relatively small space work if it has a lot of variety in accessible height, giving them a large prowling area because it has levels.  The smaller the space, the more conscious planning and thought about what cats want and will fight over it will take to make a cohabitable space.  Lots of high shelves and tall furniture that is accessible for climbing, with multiple paths to and from the same spaces, will make it so that the same square footage apartment has a lot more cat territory, and generally more territory is better.  So if, for example, a room has a path and places to hide/rest around it above human head height, and a path and resting/hiding places around it at torso height, and places to hide and creep behind at/below knee height, it has almost 3 times as much cat territory as a room the same place that only has a handful of places to prowl or rest.", "again i did ask where she wanted me to move it. maybe she will make another comment and i will ask her again and we can come to some compromise *shrug*", "your assumption is incorrect. she lived here first and needed to find two people to sign a lease with her because she can not afford it alone and her other two roommates moved out at the end of her previous lease. we all report to a landlord.", "sorry i misread \u2764\ufe0f", "Hm.

They have only complained about smell if it's a fresh stinky poop, the windows are closed and the heater too close to the cat litter.\n\nJust use common sense where you place it, place it close to a window and away from heaters is a good start. Bathrooms/hallways are a bad place, if you have heated floors there. Also, let in fresh air several times a day for a few hours to keep the air moving.\n\nChoice of cat sand can also be important, whenever my cat pees you can smell a hint of lavender if you are close enough/standing over it.\n\nEdit: Yes, bits of the cat sand can follow out of the litter, on the paws and such, this happens no matter where it is placed, and sometimes you will find the pebbles on the other side of the house/apartment. One can mitigate this some by having a good mat to catch the pebbles in front of the litter, however this is something that will happen regardles. Just grab a broom and sweep it up any time you walk past, and vaccum a bit more often.", "I have one cat, it has a litter box in the furnace room. I have several sisters who all have multiple cats, they have one litter box for 3 cats and clean it frequently.  Have one box in your room, it's not the roommates issue, it's OP's issue.  They never should have gotten a second cat to begin with from the sounds of it, but don't let your cat be lazy.", "Two boxes are not enough, the appropriate amount of litter boxes are the number of cats plus one. So three for two cats is right!", "definitely will talk it out and i will only go down to two if one is outside of my room. honestly it doesn\u2019t matter how many are in my room but a box does need to be somewhere in the house. i wish we could had talked it out when she asked me instead of telling me \u201cwhere i had it before\u201d lol", "i just want to add that in the future i suggest that maybe you should educate yourself before giving judgement", "Maybe get a cover for the liter boxes? \n\nPeople style their dogs crates so they\u2019re not sore thumbs but to also make them more like safe dens, perhaps do the same for your cats to make them obscure but also more private", "We had ours in the basement, laundry, bathroom, garage, or barn at different times of my life. Not in a bedroom, not in a living room. In places that don\u2019t have soft furnishings. But that\u2019s not particularly relevant, if you\u2019re both ok with the litter box being in some area, it wouldn\u2019t matter.", "it\u2019s actually not good for you to keep a litterbox in your bedroom either, really bad for your breathing especially if you don\u2019t replace the litter each time the cat uses it. i really think you should re-think, with your flatmate, the healthiest, safest and cleanest way to keep your pets. i can\u2019t imagine the litter box was clean when your roommates\u2019 things fell in there, but i could see if the tray was permanently kept fresh and clean it being less of an issue. \n\n*had cats all my life\n*massive germ-a-phobe", "I don't even have them in the bedroom. One upstairs loo, one downstairs. Can you not get a covered one for the lounge so 1. Guests don't have to see cat poop 2. Unlikely to cause a problem if anything were to fall 3. More hygienic (less tossed litter and tracking) and 4. Your room mate might be a bit more ok with that as a compromise? Edit to say NAH there's reasons on both sides", "You may be a nice person, I wouldn't want you as a roommate.  I wouldn't tolerate a litter box in the living room, and it sounds like your roomies are with me.  Best of luck to you though.", "So let me make this clear as a fellow owner of 2 cats. YTA. Putting a litter box in the living room, which is a shared space, is incredibly inappropriate and you should never have done it without discussing it with her first. This is entirely a you problem. If you want 3 litter boxes, you need to do the work to find a lab unobtrusive place that isn\u2019t going to stink up your main living areas.", "You should ask her if she thinks the litter boxes stink. To most people the stink is so obvious that they don't even think it needs to be said out loud, it just goes with the litter box.", "Congrats on having a furnace room\u2026I don\u2019t even know wtf that is and I highly doubt OPs apartment happens to have one. There should be a litter box per cat. Just cause your sisters don\u2019t have enough litter boxes doesn\u2019t mean OP is doing something wrong\n\nAlso, OP said her Roomate knew she had a cat and thought that the cat should have a sister", "That is dangerously bad advice.", "I\u2019m comfortable with my judgment in light of this info. Cat feces and urine in common living areas with soft furnishings where people relax and host guests is a reasonable thing for a roommate to reject after her personal item fell in it.", "all of your points your making can be made in vice versa as she does not afford to live alone either, she signed a lease that is pet friendly, so she agreed to live with pets. if this was a dog (which are allowed) the accidents would be way worse as they literally piss and shit on furniture.", "will do lol \ud83d\ude06", "she signed a pet friendly lease. i am open to talking with her about where she would rather i put it, as i already asked her but they need multiple boxes.", "Dogs are very trainable animals, no one would have them if they destroyed your house.  They're definitely more challenging to maintain over a cat, but they do their business outside.  You just have to open the door for them.  You raised your dog terribly if it's doing it's business inside.", "I foster dogs who usually have not been inside a house before, let alone had any housetraining and I have literally never had a dog toilet on my furniture. This really is more of a cat thing as they like to bury their waste in your blankets, laundry etc.", "Any dog that is reasonably trained and has no medical issues will not defecate or urinate on furniture.", "And seriously. I had cats for 13 years, I thought their boxes didn't stink at all. Now, 5 years after all of their stuff was cleaned out, now I smell it, even though their boxes were kept clean, even though the litter box room has been thoroughly cleaned multiple times. The stink is still there. But I could not smell it while I had my cats.", "Why are you debating people on aita? Go do whatever you wanna do. The consensus has been remarkably clear.", "Cats are actually really trainable as well, people just have to put in a little more effort. My senior cat gives alerts when I fall or choke, and will \"speak\" on command. She used to do more but has a hard time because if physical limitations. My younger one will play fetch and come to his name or a clicker. And he's halfway trained on alerts. When I fall he runs over to me and starts wailing. We're going to work on him getting my partner physically instead of making noise it just hasn't happened yet.\n\nThat has nothing to do with this situation, I just wanted to mention cats can be trained to do anything a dog can within their physical capabilities.", "you\u2019re getting off track, i made the point about the dogs bc she signed a pet friendly lease so she definitely should had thought about that if she did not want to tolerate litter boxes outside of her roommates bedrooms.", "bc i have time to"]}
