This is what happens in a society that doesn't appreciate parenthood.", "So NTA. \n\n>she thinks I\u2019m lying by saying I\u2019m too busy because I\u2019m on maternity leave and that I have \u201call the time in the world\u201d and all her other friends work full time.\n\nYour SIL has no comprehension of the time constraints a newborn imposes on a new mother.\n\nYour brother can kick rocks as he is equally ignorant. \n\nYou've offered two very reasonable alternatives (more than I would have) and both are being rejected as \"not enough\". \n\nIf she has the opportunity, she'll dump ALL OF IT directly onto you and then get mad at you when it isn't up to her standards.\n\nRun.", "NTA. If I was you I would pose the question of why she is being so insistent. As you said you are cordial at family gatherings but you aren't exactly besties and the MOH needs to be someone that not only has the time to be invested in the wedding but someone that is invested in the bride as well as the entire point of the MOH is to make everything as smooth for the bride as possible. Was she your MOH or something? I just can't wrap my mind on why she would want someone that she has a cordial relationship with to fill such a big role.", "NTA more people need to understand that maternity leave isn\u2019t just a vacation", "Wow, entitled much? You're NTA at all. Your SIL is a brat who has zero care for other people's boundaries. She has no *right* to your time just because you're \"not working\". Being a new mom *is* work and not easy at that! I would not want to even be in the bridal party at this point.", "NTA. You did the right thing by being up front and transparent about your capacity.", "NTA\n\nI mean, what you did was truly a stand-up thing for you to do. You and only you know your capacity, and you know that you would not do a good job. And since you care for the future SIL and want the best for her, you bowed out.", "NTA. Future SIL is a drama queen.\n\nThe punchline is that you're not even very close to her, and probably not the right person for the job even if you had time.\n\nI'm betting this becomes a pattern of behavior, blaming people in her husband's family for her problems.", "NTA and it\u2019s great. You recognize your limitations and didn\u2019t agree to something you\u2019re not capable of fulfilling right now. Focusing on your kids should be your main priority.

Aside from an infant being full time work, she's right about one thing, you're *not working*. So how are you supposed to afford a bachelorette party and a bridal shower, on top of the costs of your bridesmaids dress and other expenses? Those things are not cheap, and those responsibilities should be asked of someone she's actually close to, not someone she only hangs out with at family get togethers.", "NTA- I don't think her husband should have blabbed but that's a different issue. I also wouldn't be MOH at all now, if she's like this now, she's not going to change down the road.", "NTA She needs to get some friends instead of asking convenient and not-close family members. Plus, why would you want a MOH who actively doesn't want the job?", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. Your SIL is sensitive and appears to be a bit self centered. I am currently a MOH for my best friend and it takes a lot of planning, time and money. Maybe you could ask her to appoint a bridesmaid to split the responsibility with you. But you really do have every right to say no. Tell your husband to stop playing whisper down the lane with his brother and just repeat what you have already told her. You were very nice about it. She should be more accommodating to you honestly.", "You don't have to be her MOH if you don't want to. It's that simple.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Baby, no baby. Job, no job. You don't need to justify your time when someone asks you for a favor. She has made it very clear that the only reason she asked you to be MOH is because you \"have the time\". She just wants to use you as a party planner. I would back out of this whole thing entirely. Attend as a guest only.", "NTA don't do it. She doesn't want you, she want the the time you've got off to be with your baby. F her.", "NTA. You need to explain to her that maternity leave is plenty of work and you need to focus on baby.", "NTA why would she even want a maid of honor who has indicated that she can\u2019t take on the role with gusto?", "NTA - also I\u2019m wondering if she though you were going to fund shower and bachelorette ? In my family mothers and sisters though the shower - MOH does do the bachelorette which is usually informal and inexpensive.", "NTA.  You just had a baby.  That should be obvious to anyone that it's a ton of work, and exhausting - post partUm, etc - just all of it", "I can tell just from this that she thinks the bridal party has a responsibility to do anything other than buy a dress and be there the day of the wedding. NTA and you dodged a bullet.", "NTA and at this point I would probably not even agree to be a regular bridesmaid. It sounds like she just wants/needs a wedding and party planner, not a MOH, and is taking advantage of the fact that you\u2019re on maternity leave, which she seems to think is equivalent to an extended vacation. Frankly, the two of you have a lot of years of being family ahead of you and she\u2019s not so smart to ruin your relationship over something so trivial.\n\nAlso, can I just say that I HATE the expectation that MOHs and bridesmaids are supposed to devote so much time and money to their friend\u2019s weddings?!", "NTA.  Your future SIL only cares about herself and thinks the world revolves around her.", "NTA. Keep your boundaries strong with these family members or they\u2019ll have you running around with all their little errands as well. I\u2019ve some friends who shortened their maternity leave simply to get away fr toxic demands of their family and friends on their time and energies, and their health and baby were anyways not benefiting from it much - in fact it was the other way around", "NTA\n\nDoes she really want a bachelorette party planned by someone who is organizing it to be compatible with the task of caring for (and breastfeeding?) an infant?\n\nNo alcohol, organized around access to mothercare rooms for breastfeeding, places for the baby to nap, etc?  Even if you arrange for someone else to watch the baby, you'll still need time for pumping, etc.\n\nIf she wants you to run these events, they will need to be compatible with your ongoing responsibilities.  \n\nYour are working.  You're doing the work of caring for an infant.  Anything she needs comes second to that - a baby's needs can't be made to stop for a day or a weekend.  If the work demands of the other bridesmaids are too much for her to have her activities work around, how much more does your work of caring for an infant interfere with plans made the way she wants?\n\nTell her that if she wants you to plan and run these activities, they will be planned in a way to not interfere with the care of your child, which is currently your job.  If she isn't willing to compromise to work around someone else's 9-5 schedule, does she really want to compromise to work around your 24/7 childcare?", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to those parties. If her bridal party - regardless of employment situation - is unable to plan and execute them, well, of course that\u2019s disappointing for her and I acknowledge that, but life happens.", "NTA.  Don't give in, even \"half way\".  Parents should put the needs of their own children first, and it sounds like that's what you're doing.", "YTA,  you should have just told he no from the start with out the excuse of being a new mom,  this is one of those statements that rubs me wrong.  seems to me today's new moms are actually useless people.
