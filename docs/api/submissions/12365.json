If I was you I would pose the question of why she is being so insistent.

Was she your MOH or something? I just can't wrap my mind on why she would want someone that she has a cordial relationship with to fill such a big role.", "NTA more people need to understand that maternity leave isn\u2019t just a vacation", "Wow, entitled much? You're NTA at all. Your SIL is a brat who has zero care for other people's boundaries. She has no *right* to your time just because you're \"not working\".

You did the right thing by being up front and transparent about your capacity.", "NTA\n\nI mean, what you did was truly a stand-up thing for you to do. You and only you know your capacity, and you know that you would not do a good job. And since you care for the future SIL and want the best for her, you bowed out.", "NTA. Future SIL is a drama queen.\n\nThe punchline is that you're not even very close to her, and probably not the right person for the job even if you had time.\n\nI'm betting this becomes a pattern of behavior, blaming people in her husband's family for her problems.", "NTA and it\u2019s great. You recognize your limitations and didn\u2019t agree to something you\u2019re not capable of fulfilling right now. Focusing on your kids should be your main priority.

Aside from an infant being full time work, she's right about one thing, you're *not working*. So how are you supposed to afford a bachelorette party and a bridal shower, on top of the costs of your bridesmaids dress and other expenses?

I also wouldn't be MOH at all now, if she's like this now, she's not going to change down the road.", "NTA She needs to get some friends instead of asking convenient and not-close family members. Plus, why would you want a MOH who actively doesn't want the job?", "Of course you\u2019re NTA. Your SIL is sensitive and appears to be a bit self centered. I am currently a MOH for my best friend and it takes a lot of planning, time and money. Maybe you could ask her to appoint a bridesmaid to split the responsibility with you. But you really do have every right to say no. Tell your husband to stop playing whisper down the lane with his brother and just repeat what you have already told her. You were very nice about it. She should be more accommodating to you honestly.", "You don't have to be her MOH if you don't want to. It's that simple.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Baby, no baby. Job, no job. You don't need to justify your time when someone asks you for a favor. She has made it very clear that the only reason she asked you to be MOH is because you \"have the time\". She just wants to use you as a party planner. I would back out of this whole thing entirely. Attend as a guest only.", "NTA don't do it. She doesn't want you, she want the the time you've got off to be with your baby. F her.", "NTA. You need to explain to her that maternity leave is plenty of work and you need to focus on baby.", "NTA why would she even want a maid of honor who has indicated that she can\u2019t take on the role with gusto?", "NTA - also I\u2019m wondering if she though you were going to fund shower and bachelorette ? In my family mothers and sisters though the shower - MOH does do the bachelorette which is usually informal and inexpensive.", "NTA.  You just had a baby.  That should be obvious to anyone that it's a ton of work, and exhausting - post partUm, etc - just all of it", "I can tell just from this that she thinks the bridal party has a responsibility to do anything other than buy a dress and be there the day of the wedding. NTA and you dodged a bullet.", "NTA and at this point I would probably not even agree to be a regular bridesmaid. It sounds like she just wants/needs a wedding and party planner, not a MOH, and is taking advantage of the fact that you\u2019re on maternity leave, which she seems to think is equivalent to an extended vacation. Frankly, the two of you have a lot of years of being family ahead of you and she\u2019s not so smart to ruin your relationship over something so trivial.\n\nAlso, can I just say that I HATE the expectation that MOHs and bridesmaids are supposed to devote so much time and money to their friend\u2019s weddings?!", "NTA.  Your future SIL only cares about herself and thinks the world revolves around her.", "NTA. Keep your boundaries strong with these family members or they\u2019ll have you running around with all their little errands as well. I\u2019ve some friends who shortened their maternity leave simply to get away fr toxic demands of their family and friends on their time and energies, and their health and baby were anyways not benefiting from it much - in fact it was the other way around", "NTA\n\nDoes she really want a bachelorette party planned by someone who is organizing it to be compatible with the task of caring for (and breastfeeding?) an infant?\n\nNo alcohol, organized around access to mothercare rooms for breastfeeding, places for the baby to nap, etc?  Even if you arrange for someone else to watch the baby, you'll still need time for pumping, etc.\n\nIf she wants you to run these events, they will need to be compatible with your ongoing responsibilities.  \n\nYour are working.  You're doing the work of caring for an infant.  Anything she needs comes second to that - a baby's needs can't be made to stop for a day or a weekend.  If the work demands of the other bridesmaids are too much for her to have her activities work around, how much more does your work of caring for an infant interfere with plans made the way she wants?\n\nTell her that if she wants you to plan and run these activities, they will be planned in a way to not interfere with the care of your child, which is currently your job.  If she isn't willing to compromise to work around someone else's 9-5 schedule, does she really want to compromise to work around your 24/7 childcare?", "NTA. Nobody is entitled to those parties. If her bridal party - regardless of employment situation - is unable to plan and execute them, well, of course that\u2019s disappointing for her and I acknowledge that, but life happens.", "NTA.  Don't give in, even \"half way\".  Parents should put the needs of their own children first, and it sounds like that's what you're doing.", "YTA,  you should have just told he no from the start with out the excuse of being a new mom,  this is one of those statements that rubs me wrong.  seems to me today's new moms are actually useless people.

You should be seated next to or directly behind your Parent-In-Laws at the ceremony and with your husband at the reception.  You don't need to be in the party just to do the aisle walk and first dance with him.  If you don't really have that intimate relationship with her, acting as MOH in particular would be extremely awkward.", "NTA a baby is a 27/7 job.  It sounds like the only reason she asked you to be MOH is to have you do all the work. Let her know that you will have the baby at every event as you do not have daycare since you are on leave.

I would have my husband tell his brother that you will just be guests at this point.", "I would consider not going at all.", "I can answer this as not the OP.

You really should decline to be a part of this at all, it will only go downhill from here. Tell them you just do not have the time- period. They are going to fuss, but they will anyway.

No, it's just something you read about online and laugh at/say how crazy it is.

But as an American, all this extra stuff for an MOH sounds insane to me. I think the whole idea of all the crazy extra expensive stuff when you could be saving for a house, or travel or whatever as well sounds crazy, but to force someone else to pay for whatever as well? That's my perspective.", "When I was a MOH no, I hosted a bridal shower, low key, few games, bride opened gifts and a fancy homemade cake and coffee.  That was a long time ago.  Not sure anymore.

Honestly she wants the impossible", "Can you accept and delegate?  I was a bridesmaid in a wedding where the MOH needed help.  (Not a baby, but like you, she had a lot going on.)  I helped her plan her bridal shower.  One of the other bridesmaids planned the bachelorette party, and so on.  Maybe the other bridesmaids can help make this manageable?", "NTA you don\u2019t have to give up your time to be with your family just to accommodate her needs", "Lol way for her to ensure you wouldn\u2019t want to do it even if you could. Why would anyone take on this role for someone treating them with such disrespect? NTA. And maternity leave is not having all the time in the world, I\u2019d be willing to bet you\u2019re getting less sleep and free time than you would if you were at work. Sounds to me like you dodged a bullet here.", "I didn\u2019t have a bridal shower because my MOH and bridesmaids (except for one who was really young) lived far away.

You are on maternity, you have a little baby, that is more work than a paying job! Say no and mean it.", "NTA you\u2019re communicating your time commitments and holding that boundary.

Hmmm\u2026.sounds strange. Then I read the part about how you\u2019re on maternity so she feels you \u201chave all the time in the world, while her friends work\u201d. Boom! There it is. She didn\u2019t ask you to be MOH due to any fond feelings for you. She figured you\u2019d have the time to cater to all her Bridezilla demands (engagement party, shower. Bachelorette trip, etc.). In other words, she plans to use you as her unpaid wedding planner or servant. \nFirst of all, you\u2019re on maternity leave, not on holiday. You\u2019re busy taking care of a baby, so you do not have all the time in the world. Tell Bridezilla to find someone else to be her unpaid servant.

Stick to being a bridesmaid, it's possible you may still end up as friends. As MOH, you can already tell how demanding she'll be and it will all be downhill from here.", "NTA don\u2019t even be a bridesmaid \n\nMaternity leave is not vacation", "NTA. What in the ever-loving-fuck? She's lucky you're even offering to be in the bridal party, let alone do HALF of the MOH duties with a 5-6 month old baby. Babies are a ton of work, on little sleep. You are not obligated to do anything for her and at this point, I'd reconsider being in the wedding party at all. She'll find out for herself if/when she has a baby and if she has any humility at all, she'll apologize to you for making such an ignorant misunderstanding.", "Nta. They clearly have no clue what's involved in taking care of a baby. Unfortunately, they've weaponized their ignorance and aimed it at you. \n\nWhy not invite the brother over to spend the day with you all so he can see all the time in the world you have to spend.", "NTA. Being in a wedding party in any capacity is merely an invitation, not an obligation. You have presented valid reasons why you may not have time or energy to devote to being maid of honor. You have every right to stand by your decision: \"Thank you for thinking of me, but I won't be able to do as you ask.\" The real question is why is she so insistent that you assume this pivotal role? I would want only a willing and ready maid of honor, not someone who felt compelled to do it because of familial pressure. Talk about a downer for what's meant to be a celebratory gathering! I'd reiterate my thanks for the offer, but no, thank you. She will get over it, because the wedding taking place is not contingent upon you being in the wedding party -- at least it ought not to be.", "If you know that, why would you even consider being in the bridal party?", "Sounds like fun and definitely the way to go. I don't understand all these expensive hoopla bridesmaids or bachelorette things forced on the wedding party even if they can't really afford it.", "The problem is you read a out it online, and then people begin to assume it's normal for them to do it, too.", "Yeah, I don't get it, either. I'd rather use that money for a down payment on a house or condo."]}
