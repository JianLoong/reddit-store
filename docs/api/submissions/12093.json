If your goal is to explain that people need to be honest and have frank conversations about STDs with their partners, then I could see your reasoning for giving more detail, but I\u2019d still be careful. Maybe just tell her you found out later you contracted it from someone who wasn\u2019t honest with you about it, but don\u2019t give details, and she can make her own assumptions.", "Say you know because it is medically been proven by millions of people...not just you\ud83d\ude44", "YWBTA if you include the parts about her dad.

Even if it makes her father look bad?\n\nThis just seems like a really bad reason to give her this information. YWNBTA for disclosing your own std status and the facts surrounding her birth but it doesn't *just* make her father look bad; it makes you look bad for keeping it from her and apparently not having a comprehensive std talk with her before this happened.\n\nYWBTA if you did it just to 'prove' the friend can have kids. They're both probably in shock and clearly they're thinking about vaginal delivery. If she's actually at a hospital, yes, she can deliver safely. If the baby comes early or there's some other unforseen issues, it's possible she could deliver vaginally and pass on herpes without wanting to. Because you were already pregnant when you found out, you didn't have a choice. Your daughter's friend does. If she chooses not to risk it, that's completely valid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
