If your goal is to explain that people need to be honest and have frank conversations about STDs with their partners, then I could see your reasoning for giving more detail, but I\u2019d still be careful. Maybe just tell her you found out later you contracted it from someone who wasn\u2019t honest with you about it, but don\u2019t give details, and she can make her own assumptions.", "Say you know because it is medically been proven by millions of people...not just you\ud83d\ude44", "YWBTA if you include the parts about her dad.

YWNBTA for disclosing your own std status and the facts surrounding her birth but it doesn't *just* make her father look bad; it makes you look bad for keeping it from her and apparently not having a comprehensive std talk with her before this happened.\n\nYWBTA if you did it just to 'prove' the friend can have kids. They're both probably in shock and clearly they're thinking about vaginal delivery. If she's actually at a hospital, yes, she can deliver safely. If the baby comes early or there's some other unforseen issues, it's possible she could deliver vaginally and pass on herpes without wanting to. Because you were already pregnant when you found out, you didn't have a choice. Your daughter's friend does. If she chooses not to risk it, that's completely valid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She is trusting the advice of a recently diagnosed friend?  Who clearly does not know what she is talking about.  Heck, when I received my diagnosis, the first thing I did, (this was in 92\u2019), was hit up the library for books to read on Genital Herpes, also known as Herpes Virus 2, cold sores being 1.   It really is not that hard, or it is so much easier today to research on the web and get the information.  My children know of my diagnosis, (two before and one after, who is fine), as well as my second husband.  I had a healthy pregnancy, a healthy marriage for over 25 years, no need for condoms and he has never contracted the disease.  I really do not know how you going about telling your child about your diagnosis without maki g her father seem like a jerk, because he is for not telling you and for having unprotected sex with active sores", "Also, r/Herpes and r/HerpesCureResearch can be really helpful. I was diagnosed by blood test at 17 and doctors were USELESS. Even now, as an RN and I have to fight, keep up with medical research on my own, and everything\u2026.it\u2019s exhausting. Additionally I have oral hsv-2, but since I only had a positive blood test and no guidance from the medical world, every little thing on my genitals freaked me out\u2026.didn\u2019t even connect in my head that I\u2019ve had \u201ccold sores\u201d since 8th/9th grade and my IgG was hsv-1 negative and hsv-2 positive. Currently about or more than 1/2 of the new genital hsv infections are caused by hsv-1.
