This isn't a slight tummy upset, this is cutting your air off. \n\nNot checking with the catering directly is the most insane thing i've heard, or checking with a mass eatery two days before via someone else. \n\nThe whole 'attracting everyone around' means there was a giant scene made. I've had to take an epi pen dozens of times, it's not a massive scene like that. In fact, it's usually super quiet, fast and you leave immediately for the hospital.

It's possible for OP to have handled in quietly and the others made a scene.", "I agree, but the bride could have just asked 'hey, does any of the food have peanuts', and been told 'no'. It needs to be stressed well before time that someone has anaphylaxis. Why not check with the waiters, someone else, call the hotel. Man, i've attended large events like this and the catering was 99% sure, and i just said 'yo dude, totally not an issue, can i bring some food', and all was good. \n\nI agree someone else could have made a scene, but the wording of 'stabbed it into my thigh.. attracting attention' kinda implies otherwise.
