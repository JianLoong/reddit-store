Maybe one of the caterer's ingredients was mislabeled.", "I know this is super off topic... But I have never met another person who has the same allergy as me. Everyone keeps telling me I'm nuts and it's not a real allergy, so glad to know I'm not alone lol", "She wasn\u2019t asking for special catering, she only wanted to know what dishes to avoid.  A totally reasonable request", "OP wasn't looking for the bride to plan anything with the caterer, just to find out what dishes have peanuts", "I'm sorry but what difference does it make?", "I agree, that's extremely short notice. Wedding and event catering is frequently planned quite a bit in advance, and sometimes RSVP cards include a spot to select a meal or indicate dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.). It would have been considerate (and more productive) to include a note with your RSVP mentioning your allergy and its severity. Two days before a wedding is typically a very busy time with last-minute details, and your allergy sounds serious enough that it shouldn't have been a last-minute consideration.\n\nHowever, accusing you of stealing the limelight and sending a barrage of rude texts your way is just plain idiotic. ESH.", "Probably didn\u2019t think her cousin would lie to her about a life threatening allergen.", "This mental image is hilarious.", "True!", "I was at a Vietnamese restaurant recently and overheard a customer forcefully stating they are deathly allergic to fish, and making absolutely sure there was no fish in the chicken fried rice. The staff confirmed with the chef, and the woman was guaranteed there was no fish in the dish. \n\nExcept she could smell it when it came out. The employees kept saying there was no fish but this woman INSISTED. \n\nEvery person working in that restaurant forgot that FISH SAUCE is in just about everything there. \n\nI imagine peanut oil is pretty standard and people just don\u2019t think about it.", "Something also could've been fried in peanut oil. I can't imagine how difficult life with either a peanut or soy allergy can be.", "Aww! No way! I developed a tomato allergy to this extent after years of being able to eat them so I fully understand the disbelief! It\u2019s absolutely a real allergy and my few trips to resus, epi-pens etc absolutely confirm it. I\u2019m just sorry that you have this allergy because the amount of hidden tomato in food is shocking and a nightmare to navigate!", "But this isn\u2019t an upset stomach, and rash allergy. This is a dead in 20 mins allergy. So you have to make sure all utensils, pots, pans, cooking surfaces are nut free. The cross contamination of foods. It\u2019s not \u2018what doesn\u2019t literally have peanuts in it\u2019 scenario", "Exactly, they are cousins. But cousins can be distantly related and barely ever seen. I haven\u2019t seen some of mine in 30 years. I doubt that the bride on her special day really cared too much about his allergy. They were wrong for how they reacted but its his allergy, his responsibility to check that the food was okay.", "As a parent of a child with peanut , tree nut , sesame allergy. No one gives a shit tbh.  It\u2019s on us to look out for our kid. Cross contamination is a real thing and the sad truth is. People just don\u2019t really care to have someone\u2019s else\u2019s allergies in their mind unless they are responsible for their care .", "But with an allergy that bad, you can\u2019t just simply avoid the dish with peanuts.", "Yeah he wasn't asking them to change anything. Just a heads up so that he doesn't eat something that could kill him.", "Cross-contamination is a thing. OP is responsible for making sure the bride knows to let the caterer know to avoid cross-contamination of her allergen more than three days before the wedding. \n\nOP also didn't appear to impress the severity of their allergy on the bride-- if OP says \"what has my allergen in it, I'll avoid it,\" then bride goes to the caterer and goes, \"hey do any of these dishes have peanuts in them?\" without mentioning its about a deadly peanut allergy, the caterer might say, \"oh none\". And even if the caterer does say, \"no peanuts, but because you never asked for it we can't guarantee it was cooked in a peanut-free environment and cross contamination didn't occur,\" the bride could have easily, reasonably thought \"if cross-contamination is an issue, she wouldn't just say she'll avoid anything with peanuts, so it must not he an issue,\" and herself forget to mention the warning to OP. \n\nDepending on a last minute game of telephone that could easily lose a piece of key information along the way (whether anything could have been cross-contaminated) was mistake on OPs part in the first place. Proper thing to do is mention it (and it's severity, the fact cross-contamination is a concern, ect) when you initially RSVP months before so the bride can ask the caterer to prepare the food in an allergen-free environment or get an allergen-free substitution plate for OP. None of these things can be guaranteed with three days notice.", "Why are we assuming she wasn't sure? If she asked the caterer and the caterer said \"no,\" without knowing the ask was about an allergy and cross-contamination would be a concern, this could have absolutely been a miscommunication in the first place? \n\nOP getting harassed by the bride makes the bride TA, but that doesn't mean she lied intentionally.", "Regardless, if you are that allergic to something, probably best to double check with the people actually making the food", "I'm allergic to fish as well.  I went to a restaurant (just a regular pub type place) and got a burger and fries.  Plate came, and I asked the waitress if the kitchen only had 1 deep fryer.  I could smell/sense the fish on the fries.  Turns out I was right, they deep fried the fish in the same fryer as the fries.", "Most peanut oil is refined to where people with peanut allergies can eat it! (Thankfully, I have a peanut allergy and love Five Guys)", "Except OP didn't ask to change the menu? She just asked so she knew what to avoid. Totally reasonable that if there was nothing for her to eat she would probably bring her own food or not eat anything.", "I also developed it later in life, it started as a mild latex allergy \ud83d\ude0f awe I feel you, it's a terrible allergy! I'm sensitive to all nightshades so trying to find something without potato starch/flour in it is roughhhhh haha I'm sorry u got this allergy too, I always joke I have to eat plain white girl food cuz flavour is no longer an option haha", "Okay, so, I\u2019m your scenario, the bride didn\u2019t indicate got the caterer that OP has an allergy which is why she\u2019s asking and that makes her and AH. Let\u2019s also add the caterer to the AH list because asking about peanuts indicates there\u2019s someone with an allergy.", "Not disagreeing with you. I pointed out elsewhere that 2 days is also too stressful of a time to ask the bride as well. Bride should have just said she didn\u2019t know.", "I\u2019ve had to get really creative in the kitchen with my food due to it. There are a few \u201cnomato\u201d sauce recipes out there that tend to eliminate all nightshades\u2026 They aren\u2019t the same but it might be worth you looking into to stop the \u201cwhite girl food\u201d syndrome! Best of luck!", "Bride seems like one of those people who don't believe in allergies so even if she knew she probably didn't care.", "I love nomato sauce, hard to get the spices right but def worth it haha thanks you too!", "But why immediately jump to lying tho? Lots of places will just say \u2018no, no peanuts\u2019", ">Lots of places will just say \u2018no, no peanuts\u2019\n\nThen their ire should be directed at the caterers they asked. I struggle to imagine a situation in which I'd be pissed at the guest if I were the groom and this happened."]}
