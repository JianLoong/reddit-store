Wedding and event catering is frequently planned quite a bit in advance, and sometimes RSVP cards include a spot to select a meal or indicate dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.). It would have been considerate (and more productive) to include a note with your RSVP mentioning your allergy and its severity. Two days before a wedding is typically a very busy time with last-minute details, and your allergy sounds serious enough that it shouldn't have been a last-minute consideration.\n\nHowever, accusing you of stealing the limelight and sending a barrage of rude texts your way is just plain idiotic.

And even if the caterer does say, \"no peanuts, but because you never asked for it we can't guarantee it was cooked in a peanut-free environment and cross contamination didn't occur,\" the bride could have easily, reasonably thought \"if cross-contamination is an issue, she wouldn't just say she'll avoid anything with peanuts, so it must not he an issue,\" and herself forget to mention the warning to OP. \n\nDepending on a last minute game of telephone that could easily lose a piece of key information along the way (whether anything could have been cross-contaminated) was mistake on OPs part in the first place. Proper thing to do is mention it (and it's severity, the fact cross-contamination is a concern, ect) when you initially RSVP months before so the bride can ask the caterer to prepare the food in an allergen-free environment or get an allergen-free substitution plate for OP. None of these things can be guaranteed with three days notice.", "Why are we assuming she wasn't sure?

Unfortunately, OP probably needed to abstain from the wedding food entirely if there wasn't a way to SUPER check on the issue.

Peanuts are one of those foods that are in almost everything by default, OP probably would have had to have requested a special meal when sending the RSVP, etc. \n\nOverall I say the bride and her siblings are being assholes (like hello, actual death would have really brought the wedding down), but also OP has to look out for themselves more with that level of food allergy, unfortunately.", "NTA.

Obviously the bride is delusional to think OP did that purposely. But OP, how long did you know about this wedding?
