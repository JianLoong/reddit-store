My big brother and his wife had their baby girl 2 years ago, after years of trying and rounds and rounds of IVF. \n\nBut their daughter is THEIR daughter. Your son? Is YOUR son. He is not a replacement for the hollowness in her heart. He is not a doll for her to get the fun and happy parts with, and then hand back for the poopy diapers and sleepless nights. Your son is a person. A human being, all his own. So is your wife. \n\nIf your sister can't see past her own pain, than she needs a therapist. Because the grieving never completely goes away. But one has to learn how to live with that grief, and not let it rule their lives and ruin their relationships with others. \n\nOnce you have cooled down, give your sister a hug from me, but also give yourself a huge hug too. Ensuring healthy boundaries isn't always easy, but it is needed. You can love your sister, while still making sure that you don't overextend yourself.

She, undoubtedly thought she was helping. \n\nNTA she over-reached but I imagine her intentions were good. I can see how her behavior would be intimidating and cause new parents constant doubt to have someone tell you that you are doing everything wrong.
