Your priority is the health ( including EMOTIONAL) of your wife and baby. Famiky wants to come into YOUR house and start being bossy and giving orders to a woman who had a baby TWO WEEKS AGO?!?!?! Sis can gtf outta there now! Your wife is tired, physically drained and her emotions are all sorts of crazy not only from being tired and creating a new human, but her hormones are worse than being a teen starting puberty, they are all over the map and they make us all sorts of crazy and keep us from thinking clearly. That's why you are there! To help her and you are doing GREAT!!! Set boundaries with sis and keep them strong. Keep on being a great husband and dad. You  got this dude! Pappa bear it up!!!

Ask her to drop it?\nDoes she have a history with you that would make her concern for your financial stability justified?\nThese questions all matter in whether you were TA or not.\nif she saw the formula, flipped out screaming and wouldnt stop when asked, shes TA.\nThis isnt the same as if she knows you have a history of financial trouble, saw an expensive priduct, commented on it by speaking loudly from another room and was promptly told to gtfo without warning.\n\nEither way, given she immediately seemed to realize her mistake, it seems like this issue is one that can be smoothed over with a nice. calm, healthy conversation, where both sides talk it out. which I hope you do.

Caring for a newborn is stressful enough. No need for some busy body to scrutinize what I am assuming are new parents taking care of their first child.

Now you can go to her and set the terms of how she can show up in your home and what's appropriate...and it's also a great opportunity to get deep and talk about her struggles. It's a great opportunity to build things up...or move along :)", "What makes childless people suddenly experts when someone else has a baby?  I was shopping with my son and he was buying diapers.  He has to buy an expensive brand because the baby has eczema and gets diaper rash when he wears cheaper diapers.  Two total strangers came up to us and told us we were spending too much on diapers.  Pretty nervy.  My son handled it well, but I was seething.", "NTA. Thank you for taking good care of your wife. Of course she is emotional with all the changes (c-section and recovery, hormones, sleep deprivation). Unless you are giving your baby poison it is nobody\u2019s business what you feed your baby.

A new mother is vulnerable enough, your wife doesn\u2019t need that added stress, and good for you for sticking up for her and telling your sister to get lost. \n\nShe would not be allowed around my family until she agrees to keep her opinions to herself unless she is asked specifically for them. \n\nBoundaries are your friend, especially where parenting is concerned.\n\nEdit: I am sorry that your sister is unable to have children, but that doesn\u2019t give her a license to parent your child or judge your family.", "It's so refreshing to read a post in which op treats their SO with respect", "NTA. It\u2019s obvious sister is co-opting the baby because she can\u2019t have kids. That\u2019s unfortunate for her, but she needs to mind her own business and stay in her place.

None of her business how much you spend on your formula.", "I think yall overreacted highly, why was ur wife crying", "ESH couldn't you just push her away before exploding and holding back so much anger and telling her that she was being annoying? obviously she is projecting herself but speaking like an adult and explaining to her would not have killed you the only person who is not to blame is your wife.", "NTA.
