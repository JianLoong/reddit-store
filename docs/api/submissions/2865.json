Ensuring healthy boundaries isn't always easy, but it is needed. You can love your sister, while still making sure that you don't overextend yourself.

It\u2019s been 2 weeks and OPs sister is over nearly every day? That\u2019s a lot.", "It\u2019s a problem bc the sister is not the baby\u2019s mom or dad and has no business making off hand comments.. especially since OP says she can\u2019t have  children, so she isn\u2019t a mom herself. after days of dealing with unsolicited advice, they had enough. \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t have to tell the sister to shut up, bc it\u2019s not her place to make comments anyways.\n\nMaybe he overreacted, but then again, she crossed the line multiple times first by making unwarranted comments", ">she immediately seemed to realize her mistake, it seems like this issue is one that can be smoothed over with a nice. calm, healthy conversation, where both sides talk it out. which I hope you do. Mistakes are Human and arguments happen.\n\nYou are downvoted because of this stupid take. As OP mentioned at the start of this story - it's not the first time his sister does that and she is overall controlling of his wife and child which isn't her.", "Why he has to apologize to his asshole sister who bullies his wife?", "What nonsense are you even spouting? OP said neither he *nor his wife* were in the mood to deal with his sister being overbearing. It\u2019s OP\u2019s sister, therefore he needed to be the one to kick her out, though his wife would have been in the right to do so if needed.", ">I'm a widower so I was once a married man so I know what I'm talking about when I'm talking about it.\n\nThis is like saying, \"I drink wine, so I'm an expert wine taster,\" or, \"I eat food, so I'm a famous food critic.\"\n\nBeing married at some point doesn't mean you know everything about marriage. Much less someone else's marriage, or how every marriage should be.", "What bullshit. Just because she is unable to have children on her own doesn't make her influence the child into calling her mom \ud83e\udd28 do you mean every woman suffering from infertility will steal a baby just because she can't have them? That's bullshit.\nOP needs to set some boundaries but what you said is bullshit", "I'm not saying what she did was ok, you could easily say she was the jerk too i was just saying even if what she did was tactless, OP might have, depending on specific context, possibly also been tactless (but maybe not, again, i feel like we odn't have full context and thereofre its hard to say)", "Also, you missed the point. Husband kicked out his sister but it is up to both the husband and wife to welcome her back in so stop trying to change goal post. It's very misogynistic to assume the man has final say.", "And it took OP all of that to put his foot down for his wife? My late wife and I didn't let people visit for 6 weeks. He's prioritizing his wife but then again he's not because how many times did he let his sister do this before he finally put his foot down? \ud83e\udd14  I call that dragging your feet. And she had a C Section so she is not fit for visitors so the husband is the AH for not telling his sister unequivocally without a shadow of a doubt that will not be accepting visitors until further notice. Don't get mad at me because y'all don't have a back bone.", "OP and his wife took it a lot longer than I would have, and I probably would have had the same reaction.\nI mean seriously, would you take advice from someone who has no idea what they are talking about?\nOP\u2019s sister isn\u2019t a mom. She has never gone through what OP\u2019s wife is going through and making uncomfortable comments when OP\u2019s wife is learning how to do things with her child and recovering from childbirth. Hormones and recovering from childbirth leaves little to no patience for ignorant and tactless people like OP\u2019s sister.", "You\u2019re a delusional person. If you have problems with how OP handled the situation, tell OP. Not sure why you\u2019re telling me. I said OP was right to kick his sister out. Sorry I didn\u2019t put a timeframe on it for you.", "You're delusional because you keep changing the goal post. I did tell OP. Matter fact. I messaged him. I politely disagreed and you got offended like a little baby back B.", "Why are you making things up and attacking random people instead of addressing OP?", "Why can't you read where I said I already did. And if a disagreement feels like an attack then you're in for a surprise in the real world \ud83e\udd23", "Are you ok?", "I smoked some ganja and now I'm giving people a hard time so they grow a spine and tell me to \"GO F YOURSELF\" in which I will know my mission has been completed.\n\nWhen they find that voice. That's it. That's the fire inside of you. Keep that fire lit."]}
