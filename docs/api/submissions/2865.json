While my wife was feeding the baby my sister looked around for the formula we were using. We use cow&gate. She started berating my wife for using such an expensive brand. My wife was clearly gonna cry if she didn\u2019t shut up. I may of overreacted a bit and told her to get the fuck out of my house. She started apologising but I didn\u2019t want her in my house.

I think three clear boundaries were/are needed:\n\n1. Invite-only visitors.\n2. Don't go poking around the house.\n3.

And congrats being new parents", "NTA Please look after your wife. She is very vulnerable now. Post partum depression is REAL and your sister is definitely not helping.

Your sister has no business telling anyone how to parent ever. Being unable to have children is no excuse for her behavior.", "NTA. Your sister is way over stepping boundaries and has no right to tell you what to do as parents.  Your wife is also recovering from birth and needs all the support and kindness she can get. Well done to you for sticking up for her and yourselves as parents!\n\nIf your sister wants to visit again, make it clear that there are boundaries and lines that are not to be crossed.

(Except your wife and I doubt she would call it an \"easy\" pregnancy.) No one appreciates unsolicited advice, but unless you spoke up earlier, your overbearing sister may have thought she was being helpful.

Your sister is crossing boundaries and trying to parent you and your wife. When you were growing up did your sister assume responsibility for you?

Your priority is the health ( including EMOTIONAL) of your wife and baby. Famiky wants to come into YOUR house and start being bossy and giving orders to a woman who had a baby TWO WEEKS AGO?!?!?! Sis can gtf outta there now! Your wife is tired, physically drained and her emotions are all sorts of crazy not only from being tired and creating a new human, but her hormones are worse than being a teen starting puberty, they are all over the map and they make us all sorts of crazy and keep us from thinking clearly. That's why you are there! To help her and you are doing GREAT!!! Set boundaries with sis and keep them strong. Keep on being a great husband and dad. You  got this dude! Pappa bear it up!!! No shame in protecting and sheilding your wife from sister's VERBAL ABUSE.", "If you think you overreacted then I'm assuming you did.

Ask her to drop it?\nDoes she have a history with you that would make her concern for your financial stability justified?\nThese questions all matter in whether you were TA or not.\nif she saw the formula, flipped out screaming and wouldnt stop when asked, shes TA.\nThis isnt the same as if she knows you have a history of financial trouble, saw an expensive priduct, commented on it by speaking loudly from another room and was promptly told to gtfo without warning.\n\nEither way, given she immediately seemed to realize her mistake, it seems like this issue is one that can be smoothed over with a nice. calm, healthy conversation, where both sides talk it out. which I hope you do. Mistakes are Human and arguments happen.
