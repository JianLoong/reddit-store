He is not a replacement for the hollowness in her heart. He is not a doll for her to get the fun and happy parts with, and then hand back for the poopy diapers and sleepless nights.

But one has to learn how to live with that grief, and not let it rule their lives and ruin their relationships with others. \n\nOnce you have cooled down, give your sister a hug from me, but also give yourself a huge hug too. Ensuring healthy boundaries isn't always easy, but it is needed. You can love your sister, while still making sure that you don't overextend yourself.

Discuss the boundaries with her, how she overstepped, and what behaviors need to stop in the future. But then, make sure she know you love her too, and care for her, and she's still a part of your life. There are ways to go about this that grow and improve your relationship, but regardless of how justified your anger is and how necessary the boundaries are, presenting them wrongly will only hurt. \n\nI presume your relationship with your sister, while obviously and rightly not the one being prioritized right now, is still important to you. There's work to be done to heal from this. She's going to have to do most of it, since the problems are predominantly hers, but reaching out in love and making sure she knows you still care about her and she's still your family will go a long way towards preventing the rift from widening.

The fact sister is unable to have children is a moot point. However, this indicates to me she really has no idea about formula, if C&G is what your baby eats, that's what your baby eats. No one should have an opinion on it, let alone shout over it. I mean first world problem and all that. There are also some babies that struggle to digest certain formulas.\n\nIf I were you I would go and see your sister and explain how you guys feel, she probably just wants to be involved and helpful because she has no outlet for her own mothering instinct.
