My stepdaughter, we\u2019ll refer to as Sam hadn\u2019t been doing well for awhile. To make a long story short, she\u2019d been getting in serious trouble while we had exhausted every resource for help. \n\nI feel like a failed father for saying this, but it came to a point it was beyond what we could handle. She got involved with some serious stuff, running the streets and using hardcore drugs. It came to an end when she got arrested, she was court ordered 90 days to a program for juvenile offenders. When her time was up, my wife and I were faced with the option to pay the program to keep her for up to one year. We were given a summary of her progress, which was extremely contradictory. It wasn\u2019t an easy decision, we decided to keep her there. \n\nThe first month, Sam wouldn\u2019t speak with us nor participate with visitations. She slowly opened up, but still very distant. She began complaining about the facility, staff, and other juveniles. She was miserable, she didn\u2019t want to be there. We reassured her, she was there for good reason and it wasn\u2019t meant to be fun. \n\nPrior to all of this, my wife had booked a two week cruise with her friends. She felt torn about going when the time approached, but honestly all she had been through she needed it. When she disembarked, Sam had hit 7 months at her program. 5 days later I receive a call from Sam, very distraught and hyperventilating on the phone. I drove three hours to the facility because obviously something was very wrong. When I arrived, it wasn\u2019t good I\u2019ll just say that. They had her separated, she was on her knees sobbing to let her come home. \n\nI couldn\u2019t get ahold of my wife, neither of her friends either. The phones don\u2019t work in the middle of the Atlantic. I called the next best thing, Sam\u2019s grandmother. I didn\u2019t say much, she told me to bring her home. I felt it was the right thing, she needed to come home. We had a lot of talks before her mom came home, I set the baseline of expectations for her behavior. My wife arrived home to the surprise, they both were very happy to see each other. \n\nTwo weeks later, my wife finds Sam in the backyard smoking a cigarette with an opened bottle of liquor nearby. Sam swore she was throwing the bottle out, she didn\u2019t have alcohol on her breath. But my wife completely freaks out, calls the program to have her sent back. She explodes on me, blaming me for all of it, said I needed to grow a backbone and maybe (Sam) wouldn\u2019t be such a f**k up. She called me a dumbass for letting her out, all the while Sam is standing right there. This dumbass has tried to be nothing but a loving father to this girl that had a very unloving father. \n\nI took Sam immediately to get a full panel drug and alcohol test, to which came out negative (positive for nicotine). Sam was telling the truth, my wife won\u2019t apologize. She still says I shouldn\u2019t have brought her home, and is still proceeding with sending her back.", "created_utc": 1673068033, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/105ggzw/aita_for_checking_my_stepdaughter_out_of_a/", "score": 1090, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now knowing you opened up about Sam being bullied and losing weight due to the extreme stress, I feel you made the right decision to remove her. If her mother doesn't understand or seem to care, it'd be worth looking at *that* as part of Sam's problems. Kids rebel - but there's a reason why. Something is making Sam very unhappy and it needs to be discussed, whether your wife likes it or not.", "NTA - OP, you are a fucking awesome dad, dude. Drove all that way for your stepdaughter. Her wanting to come home, something probably changed and you backed her. You were right to back her, especially when the screening came back with nothing but nicotine. \n\nMan, don\u2019t let your wife\u2019s words get to you. YOU ARE NOT SPINELESS, BROTHER. You wanting to try and do what\u2019s best for you stepdaughter, seeing that she was actually suffering in there, that\u2019s called being a stand up father. In any world, that\u2019s called stepping up the fucking plate and batting with all you have. \n\nYour wife better realize real quick that if she send she back, that\u2019s a one way ticket to ruining her relationship with her daughter for years. That\u2019s a fantastic way to build parental resentment into her adulthood. \n\nI think you did the right thing, and instead of sending her back should try trust for a little bit. It seems like your stepdaughter is willing to change. You\u2019re great dad, OP. There are people who would literally kill to have you as their dad.\n\nEdit: Wow! Thank you kind strangers!", "NTA. You did what you thought was best given the circumstances and the fact that you couldn\u2019t get in touch with your wife. She also has a right to be upset seeing as how she couldn\u2019t make a decision about it. However I think she is taking it too far and should be more patient with your daughter seeing as she seems to be making some progress.", "NTA. \n\nTeenagers have fucking DIED in those programs!\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkLxYtS6S3U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkLxYtS6S3U)\n\nYour wife needs to stop wasting money on these torture camps and get the girl a regular therapist and provide a stable home. \n\nI understand that you two are stressed out as parents, and maybe Sam needs a different place to stay, but I would look at Sam's family. Her grandma appears to be sympathetic.", "INFO: did your step daughter ever tell you why she was crying/hyperventilating? Or did any staff tell you what happened that caused her distress?", "This is above Reddit\u2019s pay grade. It\u2019s a shitty situation all around.", "Info: Are you her legal guardian? How were you able to get her out?", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand your wife should have been in the decision but given the circumstances, that wasn't an option. \n\nWhen you married Sam's mother, you took the responsibility of being Sam's father. Loving her and protecting her, providing for her. Kids make mistakes, it's apart of growing up. She did the time she was supposed to and them some. Something was wrong with where she was at.. You did what any loving parent would do and protected her from that environment. Juvie isn't supposed to be fun, it's supposed to teach you a lesson but it's not to traumatize you which sounds like that was happening for whatever reason.\n\nYou had a parents intuition, something was very wrong, very bad.. That shouldn't be ignored.", "NTA...thankfully Sam has you in her corner cuz the way mom sounds, she may have a lot to do with Sam's misbehavior. Sam needs someone that will support her, listen to her, and stand by her...not someone that lashes and refuses to listen or apologize", "NTA. I say this as someone that has worked in a juvenile youth program. Sometimes a youth reaches a point where the program does more harm than good. You can only do so much to maintain the relationships between youth and if the staff was truly treating her poorly then she was not going to get better.   \nDid the bottle have any alcohol in it still? Your wife may have suspected that Sam had intended on drinking but got caught first. Her reaction is absolutely awful though and will only make Sam\u2019s behaviors worse.   \nUltimately you were doing this with good intentions and in a difficult spot. I don\u2019t know if a temporary break from the program was an option but if so it should have been the one you took.   \n\nSam needs individual therapy and family therapy.", "INFO if she hadn't been drinking, where did the bottle come from? Are you fine with the smoking?", "NTA.  A tough choice and perhaps not the correct one but justifiable.  Sounds like your wife is the reason your daughter has problems.\n\nI doubt she was throwing out the liquor, though.  She was likely fighting with herself and very possibly would have convinced herself that it was okay to drink it.  Addicts do that.  It was lucky that she was caught.", "NTA. Can your step daughter go to her grandmother's house?\n\nYou may want to try marriage counselling, but please talk to a lawyer about divorce etc. The way your wife is speaking to you is extremely toxic and you need to secure custody of your child before she becomes completely unreasonable.", "NAH -. Hang on.\n\nI find you both guilty and loving Sam and having no clue of what the right answer is.  But neither of you are assholes for it. \n\nSam smoking cigarettes? Maybe she needs actual medication for anxiety while she straightens up?\n\nINFO: How long have you been Sam father figure? What is the relationship with the real Dad?  \n\nThese situations are extreme and bring out the worse in parents.  Its important to not try to kill each other emotionally.  \n\nYes.  Each of you has valid concerns. However, playing the blame game and erupting in anger won't fix what is going wrong. \n\nSo there is no easy answer to any of this.  \n\nTrying to kill each other emotionally over who is at fault is pointless.  \n\nAs for the program?  Be very careful when dealing with what has been dubbed, \"the troubled teen industry.\"\n\nIts vague and being three hours away makes it difficult to get clarity on what is going on. \n\nBut there is no incentive for these court appointed facilities to reform those under there care.  A matter of fact, it's more profitable if they institutionalize your daughter into becoming a revolving door client. \n\nIt doesn't sound like money is an issue. \n\nSo do you have to live near the bad influences?  \nWhat are the bad influences?\nHave you tried family counseling?\nWhat are the conversations about Sam motivation to do wrong?\nAre there alternatives for Sam? All girls horse ranches? \nDoes Sam have legitimate dreams? \n\nNo matter what you do with Sam, sending her off or trying to tough it out as a parent. You need to understand that the solution will be different and painful.", "NAH\n\nThere are other programs if necessary, sounds like that one didn't work very well for Sam.\n\nIt also matters if you formally adopted Sam as part of your marriage. If you didn't, you get much less say in this than you want to have, right or wrong.\n\nThe mother (your wife) may have been hurt too many times before and hasn't healed yet. Not going to rate her as an AH for this, though she's pretty close.\n\nI think laying some ground rules that all three of you agree on what qualifies for Sam to need to go into another program, and just dropping all past events and focusing on the future, might be a good start. It allows all three of you to give Sam a chance to be back and makes any choice to send her into a program again something you all can agree on instead of fight about.\n\nIf you're not actually Sam's parent (no adoption) then that would be an arrangement between the two of them and you could maybe arbitrate but you wouldn't get equal say in it.", "NTA.   Please inform your wife that your daughter had not been drinking.  If she is punished for doing what is right, it is highly likely that she will develop an attitude of \"why not do it, I am going to be punished anyway\".\n\nThis is not the message that you want to send.", "What if you suggested family counseling as an alternative, and if Sam is still acting out in two months, then send her back? At least it's a proactive step towards healing your family rather than a vote for the status quo.", "NTA, based on your other comments,  her being there  was not in her best interest at that point.  You did all you could to reach out to your wife in this very difficult time. You stepped in when your step daughter needed you.  Your wife does not sound like she is on her daughter's side, and that breaks my heart. I understand the whole family is under a lot of stress,  but blame and yelling is most likely not the answer.  This girl needs love, kindness,  and rational people who can help her through this. (And likely professionals that do not allow peers to bully her into a depression).", "NTA it sounds like the residential program was doing more harm than good. Inpatient programs are necessarily *painful* since it one to face a lot of challenging issues, but they're not supposed to be *harmful*. As a recovering alcoholic, I'd suggest you get her into an intensive outpatient program and/or require to go to a certain # of AA meetings. And the whole family needs therapy, especially your wife. If that's how she treats you, I can't imagine how she treats your stepdaughter.", "Nta. You're not a failed father. You're just doing the best you can in a difficult situation. However, your wife is over reacting and this will only make the situation even worse. As was previously suggested, the in patient program Sam was originally a part of clearly was doing more harm then good. So, instead, look into theropy. I wouldn't go straight to aa, because they are very secular at their core, and this might not be what's best for Sam. Do research on non secular programs. Furthermore, Sam's mom has some very obvious trust issues with her own daughter. I would encourage her find a professional to talk about this with. You, sir, are not the problem. But, you can be part of the solution, if everyone is willing to cooperate. I think Sam has made an honest attempt to take steps to get there, so encourage her to keep going.", "NTA. You did what you felt needed to be done in that moment. Unless the two of you have had a lot of disagreements over your daughter I don't know how or why she would blame you", "You\u2019re a good father. You have a good heart. Rehabilitation is hard. Sometimes, they have to choose to weed themselves off by themselves. A facility isn\u2019t for everyone.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe you can compromise with your wife and have your daughter attend therapy or a local day youth therapy program (one that actually helps kids) so she can stay at home. Therapy is much more in her best interest.", "Nta your wife sounds like a terrible parent", "I'm going with a soft YTA--soft because you seem kind (not an AH) if a bit clueless. There are some horrible young offender programs out there (and maybe we'll hear from people who were in some of them), but not all are, and presumably you and Sam's mom  researched the facility before extending her stay there and were convinced it was OK (non-abusive). The fact Sam had been separated from other kids isn't, by itself, reason to pull her out barely halfway through the program. If there were more compelling reasons, what were they? Did her counselor say Sam was at low risk for the problem behaviors now? \n\nNews flash: a kid with Sam's history who's sitting with a bottle of hooch is NOT about to throw it away. She merely hadn't started drinking it yet. Sam's mother recognized this for the BS it was. If before you entered Sam's life, you'd had little experience with juvenile offenders, you may be an easy mark. It's probably not a coincidence that Sam's \"crisis\" came while her mother was away. \n\nYou say you're a loving father, and I believe you. However, as counterintuitive as it may seem,  the loving thing to do would have been to insist she finish the program. Hopefully you can learn from this experience\n\nAnd for future reference, it IS possible to contact someone on a cruise ship in an emergency. You call the cruise line, and they'll guide you from there.", "NTA but you could have been played. Why did she call hyperventilating? You think it was a coincidence that she called you knowing your wife was gone on a cruise? Regardless you were concerned and had good intentions in a very difficult situation.", "ESH you are too soft, mom is too harsh, Sam is a mess.\n\nSam hasn't learned anything if as soon as she gets the chance, she is back to doing bullshit. She is going to keep bouncing around until she hits the age of majority in your state and spends time in an adult facility. \n\nMaybe take a look at a residential treatment center in a rural county. It is a more laid back atmosphere and there is not as much for her to get into.", "NTA. That girl has some problems, but not hte kind to be solved in those kind of places.  \n\n\n Also your wife also has some troubles, maybe try and convince both of 'em to go to a psychologist?", "NTA.  I am beginning to think that your WIFE is the root issue of your Stepdaughters issues. If she calls YOU a dumbest and shizztalks about her daughter to you IN FRONT OF HER DAUGHTER, that is emotionally abusive.  She is not admitting she was wrong about the alcohol thing (red flag), she will not apologize to her daughter about being wrong (red flag), she was verbally abusive to you (red flag), she denigrated her daughter in front of her (red flag).  I would bet that the mother is the reason the daughter began acting out, so maybe separating the mom and daughter is a good thing for the daughter.  And maybe for you too?  There are other places for her to go then Juvie.  Look into them, play up them being strict to them mom, then get step daughter into the program with a ton of therapy too.  You can save the daughter. The mom tho?  She is looking like a lost cause.", "ESH. You are the Enabler. The nice guy. The one that gets ever to say NTA. You're just as toxic as the daughter and mom are. \n\nThe whole family needs to attend Al-Anon. You are all wrapped up in the Addict's whirlwind of destruction. \n\nYou will regret it if you don't go.", "ETA here. Your wife/Sam's mum ITA and shouldn't have overreacted and actually listened to her daughter. YTA because you didn't allow for the completion of her program, and though she tested clean clearly she is still dealing with her demons as seen by the smoking. Sam ITA by making poor choices to put her in rehab/the facility then once let go not being open and truly sober/clean (she is well under age for smoking).", "I think your step daughter played you. I bet that she knew that her mother was on the cruise, and knew she could get over on you. How are you going to handle when she calls from jail?
