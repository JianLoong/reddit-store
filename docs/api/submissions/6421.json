I don't think the problem is the money; it's that you feel overshadowed by your sister.  \n\nI have two cousins.  The younger went to a fancy private school starting at 8th grade.  His elder brother did not.  The elder resented that his younger brother got to go to the better school, but, put simply, the elder did not have the grades when he was in 8th grade to get into that school, and they don't admit new students after 9th grade.  Even if he had managed to get in, he wouldn't have succeeded there.  Private school was not the right course for him. \n\nIt's possible that a super competitive private school would not be best for you, either.  They can be brutal.  They can be ruthless.  The workloads can be absolutely massive.  My younger cousin had to spend four to five hours a night on homework.  It's a LOT.  And you don't need private school to get into a good university.  I was waaaaay too poor to afford private school, and I got into an excellent college anyway.  \n\nTalk to your parents.  See if they could spend a bit more time with you.  Tell them you feel overshadowed and ignored in favor of your sister.  Maybe they'll hear you.  I hope they do.  Best of luck to you.", "This isn't really about money; the Iranian Yoghurt is not the issue here.\n\nKids will cost different amounts depending on their extracurriculars and their exact needs. Arguing you should get money because your sister's schooling costs more is like if I had argued I should have gotten a few grand a year because my brother's football + baseball + tennis + golf cost way more money than me playing soccer; it just isn't how things work. If the only thing had changed is that your sister started at a very expensive school, you would be an asshole for expecting a handout for that reason.\n\nThe problem isn't the money, though, it's that it sounds like your parents are basically changing their lives entirely around her without caring about you at all. Your parents moving for your sister, taking you out of private education for your sister, starting a job solely for the benefit of your sister, and presumably focusing all of their efforts and time on your sister sounds like it could be making her the golden child and you the scapegoat, though there isn't enough information to say. The potential issues here run far deeper than just money.", "Is it really about the money or are you upset because your sister is getting more attention and consideration from your parents?

Your mom is even working (once again, for your sister!) so she's less available.\n\nESH. You need to ask to talk to a therapist. Your problem isn't your sister or the public school system.

They could throw a mountain of gold at you and it wouldn't make up for being back-burnered like this.", "NTA\n\nAs others have said, its not about the money its about the lack of support and attention from your family.\n\nI think you need to discuss this with your parents.\n\nI do think its unfair that they are paying for her private school and putting you at a disadvantage academically and not trying in any way to address this imbalance. Also I'm confused if your sisters so smart why doesn't she have a full scholarship?\n\nETA: I saw a comment where you said parents wouldn't even allow you to apply for the scholarship or to go to the same school. I'm making an assumption here, but maybe you don't apply yourself fully because anything you do will always be overshadowed by your sister.\n\nMaybe focus on bringing up your grades so you can push your parents to apply to that school. Or just focus on getting into a top university. If you get into Harvard etc, your parents can't say no to paying for that, especially considering the amount their spending on your sister now!", "NAH.\n\nI think the problem here is that you don't feel seen, compared to prodigy sister.  Take comfort in the fact that being a prodigy rarely does anyone much actual good, I guess.\n\nAs far as money goes, as far as I can see, your parents are just doing their best to give sister opportunities, without taking opportunities from you.  I have to agree with the rest of your family on that one.", "NTA\n\nPrivate schools are better for getting into college than public schools. By switching you to public school to put your sister in an elite private school, they are favoring your sister. You had to move, leave your friends and school behind, just because your sister is gifted. \n\nSo what\u2019s next, she gets into an IVY league college while you can only go to community college because your parents can\u2019t afford you going to a university because they\u2019re paying for your sister? I guess if she has a full ride scholarship, they can make it up to you by paying for your university of choice tuition, since they can only pay her tuition and not yours right now.", "Your parents can't give you some of the money they spend on your sisters school because they are spending it on your sisters school so your argument has no merit. If you think they should just give you money because your sisters education costs more than yours the you are wrong that is not how life works.", "NAH - your parents want the best for your sister and want to encourage her to achieve her best; she's obviously gifted and that is being nurtured by your parents. It doesn't sound like you're too wealthy if your mum has had to start working to fund it. At the same time though, you're justified in feeling jealous that they are spending lots of money on her education because she is gifted and more intelligent than you. If your parents were very wealthy then your request would be fair enough, but it doesn't come across as though they're rolling in it. If your sister is a literal genius it would be a waste of talent to not send her to a school that can bring out the best in her but at the same time if your parents are not wealthy it would seem like a waste of money to send you to a private school (where you are essentiallt paying for smaller classes/better funded classrooms/ higher quality teaching due to fewer behaviour issues because it is selective/more resources) when a public school would be just fine for you.", "Yes, because all the greatest teachers will work for 40 cents on the dollar.", "NTA.

It\u2019s great that your sister is gifted and they are investing in that gift but they don\u2019t get to treat the other child without any consideration. If they really though a public education was good enough, you both would have been in public school from the get go. They changed their minds due to the money they needed to spend for your sister. The tuition of this school is apparently more than the cost of 2 private school educations with a scholarship. That is a lot of money to spend on high school. \nI do have a few questions\nHave you talked to them before this about not wanting to move? How old are you? Why is your sister not going to college if she\u2019s already done some community college?", "NAH \n\nLook up golden child and scapegoat. You will never be as good as your sister, nor valued as much. They will always favor her. \n\nGet a job, start saving up. Make friends. Friends can become family. Move out as soon as you can and live your best life.", "NAH - though it might seem unfair there pushing your sister pretty hard it seems.  Despite having a genius level it can't be easy on your sister having those kinds of expectations to live up to.  It does seem like the money is going to education at least.  You can still shine just as much at public school.", "NAH. Would the money make you feel better about the amount of attention and consideration your sister gets compared to what you do? I sincerely doubt it.\n\nWhile it definitely seems unfair, in another comment you say you're getting B's in public school and your genius sister is at a private school so competitive being like 6 grades ahead wasn't a default admission. You want to go to the private school, but the reality is that you wouldn't get admitted even if money was no object. It's harsh, but that's the truth of it. If your sister was THAT far ahead and had to compete to get in, a B student in the same cohort she started with isn't even on the admissions map.\n\nI'm sure it feels unfair, in a lot of ways it definitely is. The real issue is you're probably feeling like the child they just tolerate while your sister is their star. From the sounds of it, they've given such unequal attention you're not wrong to feel that way.\n\nFind a way to have that convo with them! Write it in a letter and read it to them if that makes it easier. They should address the disparity in treatment, but they simply might not see it like you do so they'll need to be informed. Good luck!", "YTA. You just sound jealous. They're not just giving her random money; they're paying for schooling she needs at her level. Why would they just give you money?", "YTA- I\u2019m going to put this as gently as possible\u2026 your sister probably does deserve more attention and money paid to her education. Very few kids are so exceptional like her. My guess is she probably enjoys and thrives having an education that challenges her. And no, you shouldn\u2019t get money from them to even things up. Not all things will be equal in life. \n\nMost kids are going to be more or less \u201cnormal\u201d as far as educational level. That\u2019s OK. To be perfectly honest, going to fancy schools doesn\u2019t have a lot of bearing on what you\u2019re capable of in life. You could be a high school drop out and end up making 6 figures. You could be a Harvard graduate and become an unpaid stay at home parent. Run your own race. Focus on your own goals.", "Sorry YTA, they are spending money on your sister\u2019s schooling, not buying her gifts or things they are not getting you. \n\nIt sounds like you are jealous of your sister.", "Yes, YTA or this is a great lesson to teach you that life is not fair. \n\nYour sister has different skills, and while it costs more today, you will be going to college or uni later and they will then pay for it, so in the end I'm gonna guess you might even be more expensive to them. If you choose not to go to college, uni, trade school or whatever, then that is your choice, they still don't have to give you the money.

As a parent, it is next to impossible to provide the bare minimum for profoundly gifted without a shit ton of $$.

You could argue the certified genuis doesnt need the additional support as she will be able to succeed with very little support.", "Yeah agreed, definitely not how it is here in Australia! I went to a private catholic high school here. While not super super expensive, it was probably around $10k per year for my brother and I together. A few kids I went to school with are teachers now, and the ones working in private schools are paid a LOT more.", "NTA, but there are many factors to be considered, if your mom has to work for the first time in her life, maybe there is no spare money to give you, that does not change the fact they are indeed favouring her. While you may feel overlooked by your family this is also not good for your sister, i was also considered a kind of a genius in my family and while me and my sister got the same treatment and education, the expectation  they had in me made me put too much pressure on myself which led to me, now, as an adult, have multiple mental health issues.", "NAH. I understand that your parents want to accommodate your sister\u2018s needs. \u201eGifted\u201c kids don\u2018t only need to feel challenged on an academic level, they often also feel like outsiders and don\u2018t have the best outcomes when put in schools with \u201eregular\u201c kids which is why it can be good for them to go to these special schools. I do think it\u2018s important to treat everyone according to their needs, like I have a sibling who suffers from many mental illnesses and has always received more special care and also a lot more money than I have but I don\u2018t resent her or my parents for it and I would\u2018ve never asked to be compensated by my parents for what she needs more. I think if your school actually is completely fine and fits your needs and it\u2019s just about the money, that\u2019s stupid, especially if you know your parents don\u2019t have enough to spend the same amount on you. That being said, OP, I understand that it can feel like you\u2018re not being seen and your sister is being put before you. You might even feel jealous, which is also totally normal. This grievance on an emotional level is fine to feel and you should talk about it with your family, maybe without getting too aggressive and without focussing on the financial aspect.", "NTA. That's really unfair. They are clearly favoring your sister and having you as an afterthought. Work for become independent of them, making your own journey, future.", "The best way to beat this is to be the best you .. for you.", "A parents job is to meet the needs of their children. Public schools probably aren't able to accommodate your sisters needs. It sounds as if your needs are not being met. I don't think that money is the problem here. Perhaps suggest family counseling in order to have your concerns heard.", "You and your sister are both entering a part of life where you\u2019re no longer treated the same in terms of resources. Making use of your sister\u2019s potential is now gonna cost more, and there\u2019s hardly something you can do about it. Expecting to be given money for no reason other than equality is unrealistic, and isn\u2019t gonna fly.\n\nThe issue here isn\u2019t money. It\u2019s that you had to give up the school you liked, your classmates, the places you liked hanging out at, all to accommodate your sister\u2019s development. It\u2019s unfair, and it\u2019s natural you feel you deserve to be compensated for it - and money is just the easiest form of compensation to communicate to your parents, but unfortunately, when you put it this way you will keep being ignored. Your parents will continue to make fun of you wanting money and not focus on the actual problem you have. Try telling them how you feel instead, and try to make the most out of your situation. It\u2019s not ideal, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to change.", "You don\u2019t deserve money because your sisters education costs more. Not even sure why in the world you\u2019d be entitled to anything", "Light YTA for asking for the money, it's your parents money to spend on their children's education as they see fit, but also I totally understand why you are feeling neglected.  Your family is centering everything around your sister, and you are an afterthought.", "NTA. Feeling the way, you do is justified. But more to it than money. Do what they said get a job. Start saving every cent you can. Get away from the from them when your old enough. Keep your savings where they can't get access. To many people save only to have it snatch away and used for something else.", "[removed]", "NTA. I would not focus on the money. Focus on the fact that your life has been severally impacted to accommodate your sister. Since your parents seem unwilling to address the situation, talk to your sister. Don\u2019t try to make her feel guilty, just make sure she is aware of how your parents seem unwilling to address any unfairness and you don\u2019t want to create tension between the two of you.", "NAH  Your request is unfair. Them laughing at you was not kind. They should have really talked to you. I\u2019m sorry they didn\u2019t hear you. \n\nIf you were a genius then you\u2019d get a different school too. Your sister NEEDS that school. A normal high school won\u2019t give her what she NEEDS. If one one kid chose an expensive competitive sport they love and the other kid hating group sports but really enjoys a less expensive competitive hobby a parent doesn\u2019t pay the difference in cost to the other kid. That\u2019s unreasonable. \n\nI had one kid with ADHD. She did an expensive sport up until private school. She started online school for two years  (free) then a private school (not free) last two years of high school (that\u2019s all we could afford). She begged to not go to our public high school. She was miserable the school was too loud and too crowded she cried every day and had SERIOUS  anxiety and panic attacks. That is when we realized we needed to get her tested. Not cheap. The private school is  1/7th of the size of the public high school. Smaller. Stricter. She was our expensive kid. We barely could afford her ADHD diagnosing and this school, plus her therapy. She thrived. Despite that expense our sons interests never suffered. We were able to get our daughter prepared for college. And she got a college scholarship! She NEEDED that EXTRA investment. \n\nOur son was cheaper. He didn\u2019t do competitive sports. He tried everything but nothing stuck. He had the same opportunities. But eventually chose a hobby sport. He\u2019s a great at it. Still WAY cheaper than the sport our daughter did. When he asks for stuff which is very rare I get it for him (usually for his PC.) Now that he\u2019s driving he seems to ask for more gas and spending (drive thru snacks) money than our daughter ever did. Daughter is quite frugal. She also got a job her senior year. Her choice. So she was covered with spending money. Parenting is not easy and you\u2019ll never be able to spend the same on each kid in the same ways. Nor could a lot of parents afford to. You make sure each individual child gets their needs met. WHICH WILL BE DIFFERENT. It won\u2019t always be equal financially. As long as both kids get the same opportunities it\u2019s fair. \n\nYour sister needs a different school. Giving you cash difference to spend on stuff you don\u2019t NEED is not reasonable. If my son wanted that we couldn\u2019t afford to pay him. Are we suppose to not invest in our ADHD kid to keep it financially even? If we did not do that for our daughter she wouldn\u2019t be thriving at college. She required a bigger investment to get her prepared for adulthood. Our son does not struggle in school like our daughter did (anxiety, panic attacks during tests). Is that fair? Did we have control over the hand we were dealt? No, but we did the best we could for each kid. Our son loves his high school so he never cared. \n\nOne more thing our son can go to school out of state unlike our daughter. He qualifies for instate tuition in a neighboring state. It\u2019s also the closest university that has his degree interest (very few schools have this). Our daughter was interested in that college too at one point but she wouldn\u2019t have qualified for in state tuition. We told both kids we will only pay 100% in state tuition. Anything beyond that will have to be a loan. Neither kid is interested in debt. She is very happy with her current university in our state. Our son will go to that out of state school. Again, these kids have different opportunities. You shouldn\u2019t hold one kid back to keep it fair.", "NTA I think your parents are making decisions that require a lot of sacrifices from you and refusing to acknowledge that. Reading your post, it doesn\u2019t seem as if you truly want money, just to be acknowledged as an important member of the family. \n\nI think it\u2019s cruel that your mom called you entitled. \n\nYour whole family revolves around your sister. That\u2019s a fact. This generally happens in cases of exceptional talent or tragedy. Either way, it\u2019s important to acknowledge the needs of the other children. \n\nIf you\u2019re a teenager, changing high schools and moving is incredibly difficult. I also wonder if your parents are saving for your future? For example, do they have a college fund for you? \n\nI think you should ask for family counseling. Asking for money makes it very easy for your parents to dismiss your very valid concerns as typical teen entitlement.", "Your plan of action should be to get the best grades you can, so you get into good colleges, and they have to pay for It.  Scholarships  would be a great idea, too.\n\nYou have to focus on your skills, not your sisters .\n\nI had the same problem. Sister that was obnoxiously smart, Tall and what ever.  I found that no. She was not all that when I realized she Gaslight me for years\n  Gone NC now over 20 years, and wow is it nice.   \n\n I just finished a 30 year career in Teaching .  I had fun, and did fun things.", "Depends. Certain public school districts do have good reputations, especially if they are in the Northeast and closer to major colleges. However, that is a moot point because location was chosen for proximity to the private school, not OP's education.\n\nThey're gonna burn one kid out and isolate the other with unequal treatment. This never ends well.", "Eh, parents are TA. They've definitely invested heavily in one kid and don't seem to be considering the other. They're  gonna burn out the first kid and isolate the second. \n\nIt's not about the money as much as they have completely uprooted one child for the benefit of the other. For example, moving schools is likely to hurt OP grade wise. A new environment is likely to hurt OP socially.

If this move was due to sister\u2018s disabilities people probably would be more charitable. The thing is that high IQ children do often suffer in regular schools because they don\u2018t fit in, get bullied and don\u2018t get the kind of emotional treatment they need, so the move to a special school like this might not just be to feel make her more accademically challenged but to help her not suffer from the implications and social issues that can come with being \u201egifted\u201c", "Hm, I hadn't spotted that, you're right... that's much more of a gray area.

You will likely pay more than your sister in this regard", "Yeah, it sucks to think about, but attending a school with some prestige attached to the name will grease the wheels for a kid's future. Doesn't matter as much when they're younger, but colleges absolutely take notice of which high school you attended, and it can give you a head start on networking if your teachers know people. It's a tiny bit of privilege that people tend to overlook.", "This person is nuts dude! Like they really won't listen to people telling them that our lived experience is way different than their fantasy land! At my Catholic school all the teachers were fully accredited to teach in our state. Some had even come over from the local public schools for a variety of reasons including their public district saying \"well you've maxed out the pay scale and we really can't afford to keep you on, if you retire it will free up enough funds that we can hire two licensed teachers that just graduated and a new coach for our new lacrosse team\". Public schools will literally force out good teachers with decades of experience to hire unproven, fresh graduates because it's cheaper for them. And the Catholic schools gladly hire these seasoned professionals and pay them as much as they can to supplement that person's retirement fund.", "For real, my chemistry teacher was not only a priest. He had a phd in chemistry and during my high school years he got phd in biology and then became a principal of his own school. Great dude.", "Yeah my school was a diocesean school but it was founded by the Christian Brothers order and they were still very much in charge even though their order wasn't fully funding the school. Our sisters were Domenican Sisters, so also known for top notch education. Our science teachers taught evolution not creationism (that was covered by our religion classes, and even in those courses we were told to form our own opinions and that even if we believe science it's still possible to have faith in God too). Most of our teachers were lay-people, so it's not like Catholicism was shoved down our throats every class, they taught the same way as any teacher in a public school would, stuck to their subject. \n\nI was in school during 9/11 and they handled the rising islamophobia by repeatedly telling us that Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet and that we are to love our neighbors above anything else. They really made a great effort to stop any feelings of hate in the students on many issues. So much so that when Westboro Baptist Church came to our tiny \"city\" to protest against our gay mayor the school allowed us to leave school that day and counter-protest as part of Catholics Against Hate. And they didn't punish anyone when a small group of us dropped a banner from the roof that proudly proclaimed \"We support a woman's right to choose\" on Pro-Life Day (we got a stern talking to about how it was unsafe to be on the roof and that we could have hurt someone walking below us if the banner fell, I think we each got a few demerits but no one got enough to earn detention even)", "Have you thought about studying abroad?

A few of the teachers at the Catholic school I went to were retired public school teachers that had been forced to retire because their districts couldn't continue to give them raises because they had maxed out the state mandated pay scale and had become \"too expensive\".
