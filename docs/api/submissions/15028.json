I decided to take some of the advice that I received, and to finally stand up for myself.\n\nThis was all a bit too intense for me, and her mother reached out to arrange a family meeting, which happened last Saturday. Her mom actually said she wanted to clear the air since she wanted her family to be able to spend Easter together, and that included me as well, even if I don't celebrate Easter.\n\nSo on Saturday, we went over to her parents' house. It was just us, since I asked to speak with them without her brother around first. Basically, we sat them down and told them that there was no way her brother was going to be a groomsman, and right now, he was pretty close to being disinvited completely. Her dad started to protest, but my fianc\u00e9 backed me up and then I just went through everything he had ever said or done to me, and then straight up asked him \"If our children, your grandchildren, told you someone treated them like this, how would you feel?\" That shut him up, and I think he realized that our kids were going to look like me and could go through a lot of the same things.\n\nThat got him on our side, so when her brother arrived, all three of them basically expressed to him how disappointed they were in his behavior. Honestly, I was surprised by how completely her parents flipped, and even though it was disappointing how they all seemed to disregard the blatant racism he showed me for so long, it was really nice to have their support now. He got pretty mad that everyone was ganging up on him, but when my FIL said that if he didn't learn to treat me like family he was going to be the one kicked out and not me, that really got him taking things seriously. My in-laws are fairly wealthy, so I think he was afraid of being disowned and disinherited, even though I doubt that that would actually happen.\n\nHe ended up apologizing, and although I don't know if it was sincere, it still felt pretty good to finally get that from him. I told him that he was still invited to the wedding, and although he wasn't going to be a groomsman, I did hope that we could move past things. He seemed to agree. Easter was pretty good the day after, and he didn't say anything even remotely snarky. Hopefully things stay that way. He's going to come over to my parents' place with her parents for Eid next weekend, so we'll see how he behaves then. Thank you to everyone who gave me such great advice.", "created_utc": 1681744141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pkhat/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "score": 755, "replies": ["This is definitely better than things could have gone, but you are right to not consider his apology to be sincere.

Your fiancee and her mom seem understanding now, and although the dad isn't great he seems to at least get the problem. \n\nI seriously seriously **seriously** doubt the brother's apology was even remotely sincere, but the fact that he felt like he had to deliver it at least shows that he knows his parents won't continue tolerating this shit from him, at least openly.", "Well this is fantastic. \n\nEveryone can learn and grow. Hopefully he changes his ways.

Looking at his original post, the fianc\u00e9 insisted that BIL be made a groomsman even after OP described how BIL had  treated him in the past, and it's frankly concerning that OP had to show her the post to get her to start taking him seriously. As someone in the comments on the original pointed out, she only changed her tune when she thought that OP might cancel the wedding (i.e., she only started to act when she stood to lose something). \n\nFurthermore, in one of OP's comments below, he states that \"She's even said multiple times that she doesn't know what she would do if she ever found out that he said something to our future kids, but she says it wouldn't be pretty.\" I interpret this to mean that she's still more concerned about what BIL might say/do to her and OP's future children-people who don't even exist yet- than she is about what BIL has already said and done to OP- a living, breathing person.", "I'm glad everyone stood up for you in the end. I hope this sets the right tone for your relationship with your BIL going forward. Enjoy the sheer khurma! :)", "I've already talked to my fianc\u00e9 about it.

She's even said multiple times that she doesn't know what she would do if she ever found out that he said something to our future kids, but she says it wouldn't be pretty. It's honestly kind of scary.\n\nI'm not going to trust him to be the best brother-in-law in the world, but I also think he knows he can't get away with things, so I've held her back from that. I have agreed that we should make sure to keep an eye out for how he acts around our future kids, whenever that happens.", "oops lol guess I should've included a link to my original post.

You're rightly hesitant about the brother, but that the rest of the family has been able to reflect and become more supportive is a great sign for everyone, even if the path there was a little more turbulent than anyone would wish.\n\nI also just want to add that I think it's good for you all to have addressed this now. When cultures come together, there often arise some issues that need navigating; now that you have managed to resolve this conflict, you can feel more confident that your new family will support you in your life to come. Congratulations :)", "At Eid OP needs to do his best to shut this guy down the second there\u2019s any sign of trouble.

When I was teaching, I found it effective to redirect the troublemakers by giving them some kind of task that wouldn\u2019t blow everything up if they failed.  If he\u2019s worried about his parents cutting him off, he won\u2019t dare screw up your ceremony.  He actually has a lot to lose here.

Eid Mubarak, and may your wedding be full of joy.", "It really sounds like this is the best possible outcome. At least your fiancee has the full story now and you have her support. Anyone who has faced a lot of racism before knows that situations and family relationships are a lot more complicated and nuanced than people who have never faced such things understand. If we cut out everyone who acted stupidly racist toward us at some point, there would be very few people in our lives, work would be worse (when the racists hold the power and you have to network with them to get by), etc. Most of us get pretty decent at navigating it. I am not excusing it AT ALL. Just trying to explain that we don't get to choose not to deal with racism. It is there and we are doing our best not to get completely squashed in the process.  \n\nIn the case of the fBIL, I can see that if your future wife goes scorched earth with him, it could come back to bite you when in laws decide they are done with the drama. It's always best to appear to the be bigger person in the interactions so you have a bit of \"credit\" to negotiate with later. Oh, and also be the bigger person. ;-)", "The reason the family flipped is because you were a really good advocate for yourself. Instead of going ballistic you got persuasive.

She had a certain vision for her dream wedding, and it makes sense that she'd be disappointed if she didn't get to see it made a reality. She's already been accepting of the fact that we're also going to have certain Indian traditions and ceremonies, and it's not like those were exactly on her Pinterest board. She's still been enthusiastic about it anyway because she knows it's important to me and my family. I think she also was just hoping that I'd be able to fit into her family the way she'd always dreamed I would.\n\nThere was really no way I was ever going to actually break up with her, at least not after she acknowledged everything. I'm really in love with this woman, and she would've had to do much worse for me to actually reconsider our relationship. But yes, she did only really take it seriously when she thought there was a chance she was going to lose me, which I don't know how to feel about. There was also no \"postponing the wedding\". We're still in the early days of planning, and we haven't set a firm date yet. We have an idea for one, but nothing solid.\n\nI don't blame her for the comment she made about our future kids. It's natural that a mother would be protective of her children, even future children. I was willing to take his treatment of me, but I would've also lost it if I ever heard him say anything to our future kids.", "I absolutely agree. My fianc\u00e9 actually got mad at me for not telling her the truth before.

Take care, and all the best.", "Sounds all good. I agree without you going scorched earth would have been the wrong decision after he apologized and so far acts better. Some of his extended family might have felt more sympathetic to him than you otherwise. It is better to deescalate in the current situation. If he goes back to his old ways, you can still cut contact then.", ">I doubt it as well, but honestly, that's okay. The bigger thing is that her parents are on our side. I think it would be a much bigger problem, otherwise.\n\nI completely agree. Your spouse's parents being ok with racist treatment of you would be a huge problem in your relationship going forward. Your brother in law still being a racist bully doesn't really matter, you don't have to have any interactions with him whatsoever if you don't want to. I think you've managed to salvage this situation pretty well, the main people that matter here are all on the same page.\n\nAlso it's worth noting that you convinced a couple of old white folks who were perfectly ok with racism under their roof to re-examine their attitudes and make some changes. That's not nothing! You're leaving these two in better shape than you found them. BIL is probably a lost cause but like I said, he doesn't really matter anyway.", "Oh yeah, I definitely got an apology from her. Many, actually. She kept saying she was sorry, for pretty much everything, even things that weren't her fault, but she was taking blame for anyway.

More than apologetic, even. She held me very tightly the night I made that post. She would not let go.", "IMO her reaction is her apology. Its not verbal, but actions speak louder than words and her actions are sincere and apologetic.", "In the original post OP already wrote that she apologized.", "I'll bring this up with my fianc\u00e9!

I did not expect them to completely flip a switch like they did, but it was impressive. It helps that her dad and I normally get along very well. Both of us are really into Ancient Roman history, and we talk about it all the time together, so I know he respects me a lot. \n\nI don't think they were \"perfectly okay with racism under their roof\". I think they really just did not realize how insensitive some of the comments he was making really were. I don't really blame them for it, honestly. I think this is a pretty common issue and happens fairly frequently with people who aren't particularly used to experiencing it firsthand. That's okay though! What's important is that they were willing to listen, learn, and empathize.", "I agree to a point. Changed behavior is huge, but a verbal apology also includes acknowledging directly that she has done wrong to someone she loves, which may or may not be included in her being afraid of OP leaving. The fact that she's strongly on his side is awesome and that her parents turned around is great, but they don't seem to really understand the reality of having brown people in the family, even with one of the threats inside the house.", "If a reading isn\u2019t in the ceremony you could give him the task of escorting his mom and grandmother down the aisle and seating them.", "You could always give him this reading, which is a Christian wedding perennial. \n\n1 Corinthians 13:4-13  \nNew International Version  \n4 Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5 It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6 Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7 It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.  \n8 Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 but when completeness comes, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me. 12 For now we see only a reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.  \n13 And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.", ">I was honestly really surprised!

Whoever is without love does not know God, for God is love. In this way the love of God was revealed to us: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him. In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also must love one another. No one has ever seen God. Yet, if we love one another, God remains in us, and his love is brought to perfection in us. This is how we know that we remain in him and he in us, that he has given us of his Spirit. Moreover, we have seen and testify that the Father sent his Son as savior of the world. Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him and he in God. We have come to know and to believe in the love God has for us. God is love, and whoever remains in love remains in God and God in him. In this is love brought to perfection among us, that we have confidence on the day of judgment because as he is, so are we in this world. There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment, and so one who fears is not yet perfect in love. We love because he first loved us. If anyone says, \u201cI love God,\u201d but hates his brother, he is a liar; for whoever does not love a brother whom he has seen cannot love God* whom he has not seen.
