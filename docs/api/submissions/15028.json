{"id": 15028, "submission_id": "12pkhat", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for not wanting to make my future brother-in-law a groomsman?", "selftext": "So, I think things have been mostly resolved, and I wanted to give an update on the situation. I decided to take some of the advice that I received, and to finally stand up for myself.\n\nThis was all a bit too intense for me, and her mother reached out to arrange a family meeting, which happened last Saturday. Her mom actually said she wanted to clear the air since she wanted her family to be able to spend Easter together, and that included me as well, even if I don't celebrate Easter.\n\nSo on Saturday, we went over to her parents' house. It was just us, since I asked to speak with them without her brother around first. Basically, we sat them down and told them that there was no way her brother was going to be a groomsman, and right now, he was pretty close to being disinvited completely. Her dad started to protest, but my fianc\u00e9 backed me up and then I just went through everything he had ever said or done to me, and then straight up asked him \"If our children, your grandchildren, told you someone treated them like this, how would you feel?\" That shut him up, and I think he realized that our kids were going to look like me and could go through a lot of the same things.\n\nThat got him on our side, so when her brother arrived, all three of them basically expressed to him how disappointed they were in his behavior. Honestly, I was surprised by how completely her parents flipped, and even though it was disappointing how they all seemed to disregard the blatant racism he showed me for so long, it was really nice to have their support now. He got pretty mad that everyone was ganging up on him, but when my FIL said that if he didn't learn to treat me like family he was going to be the one kicked out and not me, that really got him taking things seriously. My in-laws are fairly wealthy, so I think he was afraid of being disowned and disinherited, even though I doubt that that would actually happen.\n\nHe ended up apologizing, and although I don't know if it was sincere, it still felt pretty good to finally get that from him. I told him that he was still invited to the wedding, and although he wasn't going to be a groomsman, I did hope that we could move past things. He seemed to agree. Easter was pretty good the day after, and he didn't say anything even remotely snarky. Hopefully things stay that way. He's going to come over to my parents' place with her parents for Eid next weekend, so we'll see how he behaves then. Thank you to everyone who gave me such great advice.", "created_utc": 1681744141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pkhat/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "score": 31, "replies": ["This is definitely better than things could have gone, but you are right to not consider his apology to be sincere. It was made in a moment where he saw no other way out.\n\nYour best bet here is to maintain an arm\u2019s length with him. Yes, he is technically part of your family but not someone that needs to be close.\n\nMake sure to keep your guard up as he will likely be looking for ways to get back to his old behavior, or worse take some kind of revenge.", "Original Post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1270es2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "Congratulations.", "Good luck with Eid - I hope he continues to behave.", "I second this. \n\nDon\u2019t believe the brother.
