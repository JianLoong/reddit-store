{"id": 15028, "submission_id": "12pkhat", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for not wanting to make my future brother-in-law a groomsman?", "selftext": "So, I think things have been mostly resolved, and I wanted to give an update on the situation. I decided to take some of the advice that I received, and to finally stand up for myself.\n\nThis was all a bit too intense for me, and her mother reached out to arrange a family meeting, which happened last Saturday. Her mom actually said she wanted to clear the air since she wanted her family to be able to spend Easter together, and that included me as well, even if I don't celebrate Easter.\n\nSo on Saturday, we went over to her parents' house. It was just us, since I asked to speak with them without her brother around first. Basically, we sat them down and told them that there was no way her brother was going to be a groomsman, and right now, he was pretty close to being disinvited completely. Her dad started to protest, but my fianc\u00e9 backed me up and then I just went through everything he had ever said or done to me, and then straight up asked him \"If our children, your grandchildren, told you someone treated them like this, how would you feel?\" That shut him up, and I think he realized that our kids were going to look like me and could go through a lot of the same things.\n\nThat got him on our side, so when her brother arrived, all three of them basically expressed to him how disappointed they were in his behavior. Honestly, I was surprised by how completely her parents flipped, and even though it was disappointing how they all seemed to disregard the blatant racism he showed me for so long, it was really nice to have their support now. He got pretty mad that everyone was ganging up on him, but when my FIL said that if he didn't learn to treat me like family he was going to be the one kicked out and not me, that really got him taking things seriously. My in-laws are fairly wealthy, so I think he was afraid of being disowned and disinherited, even though I doubt that that would actually happen.\n\nHe ended up apologizing, and although I don't know if it was sincere, it still felt pretty good to finally get that from him. I told him that he was still invited to the wedding, and although he wasn't going to be a groomsman, I did hope that we could move past things. He seemed to agree. Easter was pretty good the day after, and he didn't say anything even remotely snarky. Hopefully things stay that way. He's going to come over to my parents' place with her parents for Eid next weekend, so we'll see how he behaves then. Thank you to everyone who gave me such great advice.", "created_utc": 1681744141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12pkhat/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "score": 400, "replies": ["This is definitely better than things could have gone, but you are right to not consider his apology to be sincere. It was made in a moment where he saw no other way out.\n\nYour best bet here is to maintain an arm\u2019s length with him. Yes, he is technically part of your family but not someone that needs to be close.\n\nMake sure to keep your guard up as he will likely be looking for ways to get back to his old behavior, or worse take some kind of revenge.\n\nHave a conversation with your fianc\u00e9 about it, and your concern that he only made his apology because he was backed into a corner. This could go very bad if her and the parents figure all is now forgiven and in the past and he starts subtly taking jabs at you.", "Original Post\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1270es2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_make_my_future/", "Congratulations.", "Good luck with Eid - I hope he continues to behave.", "I second this. \n\nDon\u2019t believe the brother. He\u2019s just biding his time. Stay away from him.", "The hero we need", "I'm glad this has worked out. Your fiancee and her mom seem understanding now, and although the dad isn't great he seems to at least get the problem. \n\nI seriously seriously **seriously** doubt the brother's apology was even remotely sincere, but the fact that he felt like he had to deliver it at least shows that he knows his parents won't continue tolerating this shit from him, at least openly.", "Well this is fantastic. \n\nEveryone can learn and grow. Hopefully he changes his ways. But mainly glad that your future in-laws have fully understood and come around. \n\nPpl can hold a lot of iffy views until they are made to see it through the lens of ppl they know and care about, often.", "I know this probably doesn't reflect well on me, but I was honestly hoping to see that OP had postponed the wedding. Looking at his original post, the fianc\u00e9 insisted that BIL be made a groomsman even after OP described how BIL had  treated him in the past, and it's frankly concerning that OP had to show her the post to get her to start taking him seriously. As someone in the comments on the original pointed out, she only changed her tune when she thought that OP might cancel the wedding (i.e., she only started to act when she stood to lose something). \n\nFurthermore, in one of OP's comments below, he states that \"She's even said multiple times that she doesn't know what she would do if she ever found out that he said something to our future kids, but she says it wouldn't be pretty.\" I interpret this to mean that she's still more concerned about what BIL might say/do to her and OP's future children-people who don't even exist yet- than she is about what BIL has already said and done to OP- a living, breathing person.", "I'm glad everyone stood up for you in the end. I hope this sets the right tone for your relationship with your BIL going forward. Enjoy the sheer khurma! :)", "I've already talked to my fianc\u00e9 about it. She actually still wants to disinvite him from the wedding entirely. I think the comments on the post really got to her and now she wants to go full scorched earth on him, even though he apologized. She's even said multiple times that she doesn't know what she would do if she ever found out that he said something to our future kids, but she says it wouldn't be pretty. It's honestly kind of scary.\n\nI'm not going to trust him to be the best brother-in-law in the world, but I also think he knows he can't get away with things, so I've held her back from that. I have agreed that we should make sure to keep an eye out for how he acts around our future kids, whenever that happens.", "oops lol guess I should've included a link to my original post. Thanks!", "I doubt it as well, but honestly, that's okay. The bigger thing is that her parents are on our side. I think it would be a much bigger problem, otherwise.", "Sounds like you\u2019ve got a great handle on this. \n\nTalking her down from the scorched earth path was the way to go. Since it was such a quick turn around that could have likely ended with her or her parents becoming resentful of the ended relationship and possibly directing that resentment at you.\n\nIf it ever does get to the point where NC is needed you\u2019ll be able to make sure people know it is because of him continuing the behavior, and not you \u201ctrying to break up the family\u201d.", "It\u2019s okay to forget and make mistakes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here", "I imagine, by helping them check their privilege, you\u2019ve actually helped humanity too. Congratulations on the engagement. Best wishes for tons and tons of happiness.", "NTA seems like you have a measured approach to it all... I wouldn't assume this is the last of it though.", "[removed]", "I'm happy for you and your (soon-to-be) family! You're rightly hesitant about the brother, but that the rest of the family has been able to reflect and become more supportive is a great sign for everyone, even if the path there was a little more turbulent than anyone would wish.\n\nI also just want to add that I think it's good for you all to have addressed this now. When cultures come together, there often arise some issues that need navigating; now that you have managed to resolve this conflict, you can feel more confident that your new family will support you in your life to come. Congratulations :)", "At Eid OP needs to do his best to shut this guy down the second there\u2019s any sign of trouble. If he brother says/does anything wrong then OP\u2019s parents and family will never forget and the situation will become a thousand times more complicated because the two families might start fighting", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's a shame she needed the comments to get her on your side. \n\nI think she needs to let you have some power in the situation and actually listen to your opinion on how you want to handle things, not go scorched earth.", "Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer.  If her brother gets disinvited from the wedding, he\u2019ll retaliate and make himself into the victim. Let him be present with no major role to play and see how he manages himself.  If it goes well, you can lighten up after the wedding.\n\nIf you want to give him absolutely no reason to make himself into a victim, you could ask him to do a reading of your choice during the ceremony or ask him to take charge of the ushers.  When I was teaching, I found it effective to redirect the troublemakers by giving them some kind of task that wouldn\u2019t blow everything up if they failed.  If he\u2019s worried about his parents cutting him off, he won\u2019t dare screw up your ceremony.  He actually has a lot to lose here.  The advantage to the redirection tactic is that eventually you might get a sincere apology from him and he might actually change.  It also makes you look like the good guy here because you \u201cgave him a second chance.\u201d No one has to know you have an ulterior motive\u2014that you\u2019re keeping your enemies closer.\n\nNTA", "This guy's a hero", "Proof that even older people can learn and grow."]}
