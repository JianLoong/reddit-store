I usually do blowouts, wolfcuts, pixies, and whatever you can think of. I also do hairstyles like cornrows, box braids, lemonade braids, etc. My roommate (26F) has her birthday coming up, and since I didn\u2019t wanna fuck up the gift I was getting her, I just asked her if there\u2019s anything specific she wanted for her birthday. She told me she wanted knotless braids down to her butt, with a highlight, beads, etc. Although I\u2019m a white woman, I was adopted by a black family when I was 4, so I do have experience with black hair. It\u2019s probably what I\u2019m best at when it comes to hairstyles.\n\n\nI told her I\u2019d be happy to book her an appointment, and would have to charge her 35$ an hour (which was VERY generous, because the hairstyle she was asking for could take 6-9 hours). She frowned at me, and I asked her if everything was okay. She told me she was just disappointed that I have to charge her even though her birthday is coming up, and because we\u2019re roommates. I told her that this hairstyle takes hours, and there\u2019s no way I would do it for free for anybody. She told me that I am over exaggerating, and that it would take way less for me because I\u2019m a professional. I told her that the least I could do no matter how professional I am is 4 hours and 30 minutes, and I could lower down the price to 25$/ a hour. She called me unbelievably selfish, and told me she\u2019s just going to get a messy bun on her birthday.\n\nI was upset that I denied giving her the hairstyle she wanted for free, but at the same time, it\u2019s a very difficult style and takes VERY long to do. But I feel like I should have done it on the house since it was for her birthday (which is tomorrow, as of when I\u2019m writing this). I decided to go on AITA; just to see if anyone agrees that I\u2019m TA so I can give her the style.

Then you offer doing it at a discounted rate or a simpler style as a present.", "ESH - For a second I thought you got here something already and a fun hairstyle was going to be on top of the gift and I was like geez n t a for sure but then i read the post and it seems like you gave her cart blanche and then backed out. I understand that this hairstyle is long and hard and she definitely asked for too much (which was rude) but you went about the compromise all wrong. Instead of charging her for her gift you should have helped her scale it back. \"A hairstyle sounds like a great gift! That hairstyle can take up to 9 hours though and is actually a little pricier than I can afford to gift right now.

I\u2019ve spent hours on my friends birthdays because they prefer handmade things to store bought. I didn\u2019t think twice about it, and I definitely didn\u2019t think of charging her.

If you make pasta by hand, for example. It\u2019s not that uncommon.", "NTA!!\n\nSpending that much time for free or (even heavily discounted )on your friends hair means you are either forgoing paying clients or giving up pretty much an entire day off to work for free. And let\u2019s not forget how hard hairdressing is on your body. It can be physically exhausting.\n\nI cannot imagine a friend asking for this. \n\nThis is like asking someone to gift them a days salary and people think you are TA for asking what she wanted?!  Who can do that?!\n\nGeesh. Myself and my friends are all working professionals and we gift each other small things like cute earrings, scarves, nice candles or grocery store flowers and maybe treat each other to happy hour or brunch. \n\nThis \u201cask\u201d is way over the top. What\u2019s next a spa day? Maybe a vacation? \n\nProbably time to set expectations which it sounds like you tried to do. Basically if you normally charge $50/hr for this service and you do it for $25 or $35 then you are gifting at least $90-$200+ depending on time. \n\nThat is A LOT!! I would make sure your friend understands that. \n\nI\u2019ve always defaulted to \u201cWow, I wish I could do that for you. Here\u2019s what I can do.\u201d\n\nGood luck!", "I\u2019ve done the catering at parties for free, which has taken a long time. So long as I\u2019m included in the party I really don\u2019t mind.", "While I agree your example would be tacky, the actual situation involves not just buying a gift but a considerable amount of OP\u2019s time. It also depends on their usual gift giving tendencies. If OP usually gives the friend gifts worth several hundred dollars, it might not have seemed outside the realm of possibility. If OP usually doesn\u2019t give semi-extravagant gifts, it should have crossed the friend\u2019s mind that it\u2019s inappropriate to even suggest it.\n\nUltimately though, you should never ask for friends or family to work for free if they have not offered their services to you.", "You said you'd charge her $35 then lowered it to $25 after. Don't change your friends for gifts, it's tacky. Be honest and say no if you are unwilling, don't try to make her into the villian because she asked for a birthday gift when you asked her what she wanted as a birthday gift.\n\nIt's interesting to note that the people who are calling you the asshole are other people who do skilled labour- might be worth considering.", "I didn\u2019t say the friend was an AH, though I do think doubling down and trying to browbeat OP into it makes her one.", "Yeah completely agree with the time vs. money thing. I have a finite income and I'd much rather give a gift that took me 5 hours to make over one that took 5 hours of my paycheck to pay for.", "> gift card for a salon that could do the hair style she wanted\n\nEhhh, we are propably looking at +400$ gift card, considering  when there are no generous friend discounts.", "Nothing really for me to eat from her hair. \ud83d\ude02 I could do the hairstyle, I\u2019ve done the same exact one she wants. 8 hours. She\u2019s going to Los Angeles, she told me I could tag along, but trust me: you don\u2019t know how hard it is to braid hair, highlight it, bead it, etc.", "> not just buying a gift but a considerable amount of OP\u2019s time\n\nI mean, OP could easily, without any hesitation or argument, have gotten friend a gift card to a salon that could do friend's hair the way she wanted it. Boom, done. No time spent, no budget issue, no tackiness. \n\n\"I heard you wanted your hair done this way, so I got you a gift card to a salon so you can get your hair done the way you want it! Happy birthday!\" \n\nThere were definitely better ways to handle a conversation about a birthday present that don't involve OP worrying about getting a paycheck.", "> we are propably looking at +400$ gift card\n\nNo I mean, a gift card that is within OP's budget. Not the entire cost.", "True, she could have gotten her a gift card to a salon, but friend specifically asked for OP to do her hair. I just look at it as being uncouth to ask for expensive things barring certain exceptions. My friends and I go all out and do often get extravagant things for each other, but none of us ever *ask* for them because it\u2019s impolite. If a friend  asks me what I want I would simply say that\u2019s so nice of them for thinking of me, but it\u2019s not necessary, or I would say something relatively inexpensive. That way if for some reason they can\u2019t or don\u2019t want to go all out, there is no burden or obligation on them and they don\u2019t have to worry about disappointing the receiver.", "I feel like this is even worse. While the gift card is a nice gesture in general, either way the girl is still having to chip in for the hairstyle she wants, only she\u2019d probably end up paying more than if she took the highly discounted rate OP offered.\n\nEdit: typo", "> friend specifically asked for OP to do her hair.\n\nSo? Just say no. Problem solved. \n\n>none of us ever ask for them because it\u2019s impolite\n\nI don't disagree, but haggling over the price of a birthday present is also impolite. Both of them are being impolite, but neither so impolite as to be an AH in my view.", "> either way the girl is still having to chip in for the hairstyle she wants\n\nBut isn't being asked to chip in for her own birthday present, which makes it different.", "I feel like OP was put on the spot and offered the discount as a compromise. Perhaps not an ideal response, but the friend  doubling down and trying to browbeat OP into doing it puts her in AH territory for me. So I guess agree to disagree.", "I see your point, but from a personal perspective, I\u2019d rather take the friend discount and pay ~$200 plus tip instead of $400+ and tip for the same thing. While the gift card is a nice idea in general, the friend wanted OP specifically to do her hair. Turning around and giving her a gift card for a fraction of what OP specifically knows she\u2019s going to use it for is likely to irk someone who expected their friend to work for eight hours for free in the first place. Just my thoughts. YMMV.", "> the friend wanted OP specifically to do her hair.\n\nright... but as a gift. \n\nSo the options are either, assist in providing hair styling as a gift, or OP does the hair as a business transaction, which is not a gift. \n\nThe friend can want whatever the friend wants, but ultimately saying \"I need to make a profit from your birthday present\" is tacky. Haggling over the price to make sure that OP makes a profit is doubly so. Give what you can give, don't give what you can't. Simple. Making it into a business deal negates the gift aspect entirely."]}
