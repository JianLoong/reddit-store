I usually do blowouts, wolfcuts, pixies, and whatever you can think of. I also do hairstyles like cornrows, box braids, lemonade braids, etc. My roommate (26F) has her birthday coming up, and since I didn\u2019t wanna fuck up the gift I was getting her, I just asked her if there\u2019s anything specific she wanted for her birthday. She told me she wanted knotless braids down to her butt, with a highlight, beads, etc. Although I\u2019m a white woman, I was adopted by a black family when I was 4, so I do have experience with black hair. It\u2019s probably what I\u2019m best at when it comes to hairstyles.\n\n\nI told her I\u2019d be happy to book her an appointment, and would have to charge her 35$ an hour (which was VERY generous, because the hairstyle she was asking for could take 6-9 hours). Keep in mind, braiding is quite literally the McKamey Manor for your wrists and hands. She frowned at me, and I asked her if everything was okay. She told me she was just disappointed that I have to charge her even though her birthday is coming up, and because we\u2019re roommates. I told her that this hairstyle takes hours, and there\u2019s no way I would do it for free for anybody. She told me that I am over exaggerating, and that it would take way less for me because I\u2019m a professional. I told her that the least I could do no matter how professional I am is 4 hours and 30 minutes, and I could lower down the price to 25$/ a hour. She called me unbelievably selfish, and told me she\u2019s just going to get a messy bun on her birthday.\n\nI was upset that I denied giving her the hairstyle she wanted for free, but at the same time, it\u2019s a very difficult style and takes VERY long to do. But I feel like I should have done it on the house since it was for her birthday (which is tomorrow, as of when I\u2019m writing this). I decided to go on AITA; just to see if anyone agrees that I\u2019m TA so I can give her the style. So please tell me, AITA?\n\nUPDATE 1: did buy my roommate 400$ worth of things. I can\u2019t give her my time, since I\u2019m completely booked, but I did also buy her a pretty wig she really liked (she somehow found it, my fault for hiding it in the closet) and some clothes as well as a purse. (also 157$+ in online purchases).\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 2: I see a lot of comments that think I would charge her for a birthday present. Absolutely not! If she asked for a more simple style like a blowout, but unless you\u2019re a braider yourself, you will not understand the full difficulty of braiding!As you can see in update 1, I did buy her a ton of stuff. The world isn\u2019t over, we don\u2019t hate each other.", "created_utc": 1668706280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxw5pz/aita_for_refusing_to_do_my_friends_hair_for_her/", "score": 1360, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nobody's TA for saying they want something for their birthday, even if it's unrealistic/not feasible. And you wouldn't be TA for not getting it for her, but I think the better answer than asking for money would have just been to say \"well I don't think I can make that happen but I'll take it under consideration when getting your birthday present.\"\n\nI dunno if I can justify calling you an AH here either, so NAH, but I do think there were better ways to handle the conversation that you started by asking about a gift.", "ESH I think you guys both communicated very poorly. She should have backed off when she found out how long it would take. But you can't explicitly ask someone what they want for their birthday and then be surprised when they expect it for free. You should have opened with the fact that that style was not something you would do as a gift. Then you offer doing it at a discounted rate or a simpler style as a present.", "ESH - For a second I thought you got here something already and a fun hairstyle was going to be on top of the gift and I was like geez n t a for sure but then i read the post and it seems like you gave her cart blanche and then backed out. I understand that this hairstyle is long and hard and she definitely asked for too much (which was rude) but you went about the compromise all wrong. Instead of charging her for her gift you should have helped her scale it back. \"A hairstyle sounds like a great gift! That hairstyle can take up to 9 hours though and is actually a little pricier than I can afford to gift right now. What if the braids were mid back instead or <insert easier style of braid>\" would have been more tactful and appropriate.", "NTA. She wants hundreds of dollars of work for free.

But expecting a free, full service is absolutely asinine. \n\nNTA", "NTA. That's a LOT of work to do that kind of hairstyle, and offering your services at the deep discount you did should still count as a birthday gift. Sounds like your roommate is trying to guilt trip you into giving her your services for free.", "NTA.

It's unreasonable to ask for such an expensive gift.  It's sad that she doesn't realize just how much time, effort and money goes into her request.

Asking for a hairstyle that takes 6+ hours to do for free is not reasonable gift to ask for. I wouldn't even dream of asking for something like that. \n\nTo me it sounds entitled to ask for something of this amount.

Asking for such a time consuming service for free is a big ask but you should have just said no instead of bartering with her.

I will give you one $50 coupon that you can apply towards any of my services, including the knotless braids\u201d. It\u2019s still the same thing you said but it\u2019s phrased in a way that makes it sound more like a gift.

She is basically asking you for a very expensive birthday present, and it's not cool to fish for expensive birthday presents.", "NTA.\nIt stinks to be asked what we want and then not get it,  but we also have to be reasonable with our requests. \n\nThe steep discount is essentially offering to do part of it for free and then charge her for the extras.\n\nLike,  if she wants a jewelry set but you can't afford all the pieces,  it's totally reasonable to get her one or two of the pieces and she can but the others for herself.  Same idea applies to movie or book series.(those are the easiest comparisons I can think of. )\n\nI can understand her being disappointed,  but it doesn't mean you needed to give her everything she was asking for.", "NTA. People should never expect friends or family to work for free if the person has not offered, and even then it\u2019s always proper to still offer to pay or treat them in some way. However, if the amount you would have spent getting her an actual gift would have equaled what her appointment would cost, that would be something to consider if you did wish to gift the appointment to her. Ultimately though that\u2019s up to you, and you had every right to decline.", "NTA\n\nPeople, ESPECIALLY FRIENDS!!!, should value you and your skills - she's being disrespectful, owes you an apology and needs to stop being so entitled.

I would understand charging her for supplies (maybe, depending on the price) but charging her for your time on a birthday present seems stingy of you. I\u2019ve spent hours on my friends birthdays because they prefer handmade things to store bought. I didn\u2019t think twice about it, and I definitely didn\u2019t think of charging her. I don\u2019t see why you would have a problem donating your time towards a gift for your friend, especially if it is time that you both could spend together.\n\nOf course, you\u2019re allowed to set your boundaries and reject the gift suggestion she made.

Which is extremely generous.  It is good that you stuck your ground because that would be a ticking time bomb.

To be safe you could have just said \" Cool I can give you a gift card to your salon so they can do it for you.\"  \n\nNever offer your services for free to friends and family unless you will be firm on everyone.

Doing them as a no-knot style means extensions and braiding hair are woven in using a more time intensive process for a smoother look on the scalp.\n\nThe friend also asked for the braids to go to her butt, which means the braiding hair/extensions will be a lot more expensive.  That triples the material costs.  Adding in a highlight could just mean adding different color of braiding hair, or it could mean adding dye work to the natural hair to match the braiding hair. Add in beads and decorations for more $$.\n\nBasically, the friend asked for the equivalent of a $250 dye job, plus $100 of materials (braiding hair, etc.), And an entire day's labor.\n\nMaybe more.
