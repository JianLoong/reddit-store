Anyway, earlier today, I got a text from my friend asking me to come with her to the store to buy some Christmas gifts for her family. Both of us don\u2019t have a car so we had to Uber there and back. The cost going was $32, coming back was $36, so $68 in total. After we got back to her place, she sent me an Apple Pay request charge of $34. I was confused as to why because she\u2019s the one that asked me to come with her. I thought since we didn\u2019t plan on going together and because I didn\u2019t want to go in the first place, I didn\u2019t have to pay for the ride. I mentioned to her, \u201cwhy did you send the request?\u201d She said \u201cwell, we both took the same Uber to go there and come back, so\u2026\u201d. I was a bit upset but I sent her the money anyway. Later during the night, I told her I was going to order food (my dad made me use his card). I asked her if she wanted anything, but I had asked in a way to make it seems as if I was going to pay, just like, \u201chey, I\u2019m gonna order food, want anything?\u201d. She said yes. My order was $34.27 and hers was $47.56. With delivery fee and tip, it came up to $92.83 total. After the food came, she looked over and said \u201cthanks so much\u201d. I waited until we were both done eating and sent her an Apple Pay request for $53 (that includes her meal, half of delivery fee, and half tip). She got very upset with me and told me I was a b-word, she was going on and on about how she thought I was going to pay.

Neither of you were clear up front, which led to confusion, which led to aggro. But in all honesty, if you are broke, why are you spending money you don't have on UberEats?", "YTA if you were broke and couldn\u2019t afford an Uber you should have declined to go in the first place , or simply been honest and said I\u2019m broke can I get you back next time ?\nAlso being Spiteful and purposely wording that food order as an act of revenge is pretty childish IMO , is this your friend or not ?", "NTA \n\nEven if you did it with malice, its only appropriate to split the delivery fee... \n\nJust like when you guys went out together to the store...\n\nHer irate reaction is uncalled for. \n\nBorderline ESH because what you did was spiteful, although not wrong.", "LMFAO.

I thought the same thing as well, anything financial needs to be properly discussed with her. Thank you", "Side note, if she did think you were paying she sure as hell shouldn't order more then you, like who does that?", "Don't see how these two equate. The uber was shared, the food was not.

OP did it on purpose so she could get back at her friend for using her to pay for half the uber ride.", "No, not me, society. And OP seems very young and inexperienced in life. Their sentence would not be construed by most people as an assumption of coverage of payment. If they convinced their friend they were paying, they must have said more than that. Their dad forced them to use his card? The whole story is odd. No need to get aggressive.", "(bangs head on desk)\n\nSeriously. \n\nYou simply cannot read the OP? Unable? CANNOT DO IT?\n\nOP states that she worded it, AND I QUOTE, \"AS IF I WAS GOING TO PAY\".\n\nWhat in that do you not understand and STILL want to talk about?", "Just because OP perceives something as such, doesn't mean it is reality.

Happy holidays.", "Hey mods?\n\nIs there a block button? A mute button? ANY WAY a person can NOT see replies from someone who simply is incapable of reading an OP, can't understand intent when the OP explains said intent, and wants to continue to reply despite having it explained numerous times?\n\nAny way at all?", "OP isn't God and literally this is called AITA to point out the logical flaws in someone's thinking. If we took everything OP said for face value, everybody would be NTA. But why are you asking mods about blocking, I just said goodbye to you. You are the type of person who needs to have the last word aren't you? Happy holidays. Have a good night, have a good day. Hope you succeed in this world. Sayonara. Bye!"]}
