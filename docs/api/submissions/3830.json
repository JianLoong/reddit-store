But if I am hanging out with a friend and they suggest ordering food OR if someone suggests going out to a restaurant to eat, I assume it is split the bill/Dutch treat. \n\nThis whole idea that whoever \\*invites\\* the other person pays is very strange to me because someone is always the person who \\*invites\\* the other person to do something - i.e. call, email or text saying let's have dinner/lunch or whatever and I wouldn't assume that means they pay.

If I plan a trip with someone else and we choose to use my vehicle, splitting gas is going to be part of the conversation just like splitting accommodations, the costs of tickets/activities, etc.   \n\nIf I say to someone \"I'm going to the Chinese buffet, want to come along?\" that doesn't give any indication I'm paying.  I think this is especially true when you're ordering food at a venue that will end up costing $50 with all costs included.  Sometimes I may grab the ticket at the end of the meal and say \"I got this one\", but if the venue is more pricey and/or the other person ordered something pricey, it shouldn't be expected that the other person will pay unless specified beforehand.", "If they don\u2019t have a ride to the store there\u2019s a possibility that to get there and back would end up eating up most of the $50 for shopping.", "Yeah, but if she's really that broke she would be asking her dad to buy her $50 in groceries instead of 1 single meal!", "Yeah, the friend was just running an errand and invited OP to come along (the post words it as \"asked me to come with her,\" so I'm not even sure if it was an invite or a request.)  I've gone shopping with friends before, with either of us driving, in situations that are less \"let's go to the mall together!\" and more \"Come with me while I run errands so that I'm not bored.\"  I go with my friend because we are hanging out and talking together, not because I actually NEED to go to the store or want to buy anything.  We don't talk about splitting gas costs in those situations regardless of who drove (to be fair, I usually don't hit up friends for gas costs anyway, but I'm sure that would change if I was frequently driving them around places).  It sounds like OP thought it was just a \"come hang out with me\" situation, since she didn't actually care about going to the store otherwise.  While the friend either thought she was doing OP a favor by inviting her along (\"We can go to the store and shop for presents together,\"), or really just wanted someone else to help eat the cost of the Uber.  The fact that an Uber ride was involved here is what complicates things.", "oh I agree.  I'd never assume that the friend was covering the cost of the food but it sounds like this friend did.  It also sounds like that friend was more interested in having somebody  share the transportation costs than the actual companionship.  \n\nPeople come at these situations differently. It really behooves a person on a tight budget to find that out a head of time.  Unless the person suggesting a meal or a ride said 'My Treat' or \"let me take you to' I'd assume I'd be paying my own way, and I'd have to consider that aspect in order to make a decision of going or not.", "Yeah! Poor people shouldn't be allowed to splurge on something to feel normal, their existence MUST be a brutal and grim slog towards death!\n\nFor all we know, she was looking to get like a burger or small pizza and her dad insisted she get something better.", "Maybe her dad just wanted to spoil her w smth nice?..", "Being broke=/= being poor. She probably already HAS food at home, and her dad offered to buy her ubereats.", "It\u2019s not that they aren\u2019t \u201callowed to,\u201d but that it keeps them poor. It simply doesn\u2019t make financial sense to be broke and eat $50 meals when a person can eat for several days for the same cost. They could have spared themselves days of hunger.", "If it's a habit, then yeah, it's going to keep them poor.\n\nYou know what else keeps people poor?\n\nBEING POOR.\n\nIt's expensive to be poor, and I'm not going to begrudge someone a treat, especially when someone else pays. Too many people judge poor people for their spending habits, expect them to cut out all joy, get 3 jobs, etc etc and live a miserable existence until they hit the magical number and stop being poor.\n\nThat's my problem, and that's what the comment I replied to sounded like.", "Joy doesn\u2019t have a price tag. It\u2019s hard to feel joy when you are hungry and have only the memory of a meal you ate two days ago.", "OP understands the language usage and cultural context of her friend group better than we do.\n\nOP says she INTENTIONALLY phrased it as if she would pay.  Her friend Thanked her in person after they finished eating together, and OP didn't correct her.  Just so she could surprise her with the bill request later.\n\nIf OP didn't intentionally set this up to \"punish\" her friend for her own previous request, WHY didn't she correct her friend when it was clear there was a misunderstanding?\n\nThe reality here is that OP thought she was doing her friend a favor by going shopping, and didn't expect to have to pay.  Her feelings were hurt when the payment request came through.\n\nAll OP  needed to do way use her words and saying something like \"I'm sorry, I misunderstood the request.  I thought I was being offered a seat on a trip you were taking anyway. I don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in my budget right now, and if I realized you expected me to pay, I would have turned down the offer.  In the future, please let me know ahead of time, if I'm expected to chip it!\"\n\nInstead she concocted (by her own admission) this elaborate plan to make her friend feel shitty.\n\nI would say ESH, because if I were the friend, I wouldn't have asked for payment for the ride, but OP responded with complete childishness...  and also abused her father's kindness by spending $100 of his money on two meals and a revenge plot.  If she's really broke she could have respected her father's kindness by spending that $100 on groceries to last a week.", "\"Joy doesn't have a price tag....\"\n\n\ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 \ud83e\udd23 \n\nYou should crochet that and hang it on a wall next to \"Bless this mess\" and all other kitschy nonsense sayings."]}
