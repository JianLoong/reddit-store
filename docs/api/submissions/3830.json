Anyway, earlier today, I got a text from my friend asking me to come with her to the store to buy some Christmas gifts for her family. Both of us don\u2019t have a car so we had to Uber there and back. The cost going was $32, coming back was $36, so $68 in total. After we got back to her place, she sent me an Apple Pay request charge of $34. I was confused as to why because she\u2019s the one that asked me to come with her. I thought since we didn\u2019t plan on going together and because I didn\u2019t want to go in the first place, I didn\u2019t have to pay for the ride. I mentioned to her, \u201cwhy did you send the request?\u201d She said \u201cwell, we both took the same Uber to go there and come back, so\u2026\u201d. I was a bit upset but I sent her the money anyway. Later during the night, I told her I was going to order food (my dad made me use his card). I asked her if she wanted anything, but I had asked in a way to make it seems as if I was going to pay, just like, \u201chey, I\u2019m gonna order food, want anything?\u201d. She said yes. My order was $34.27 and hers was $47.56. With delivery fee and tip, it came up to $92.83 total. After the food came, she looked over and said \u201cthanks so much\u201d. I waited until we were both done eating and sent her an Apple Pay request for $53 (that includes her meal, half of delivery fee, and half tip). She got very upset with me and told me I was a b-word, she was going on and on about how she thought I was going to pay.

Thank you", "Side note, if she did think you were paying she sure as hell shouldn't order more then you, like who does that?", "Don't see how these two equate. The uber was shared, the food was not.

OP did it on purpose so she could get back at her friend for using her to pay for half the uber ride.", "No, not me, society. And OP seems very young and inexperienced in life. Their sentence would not be construed by most people as an assumption of coverage of payment. If they convinced their friend they were paying, they must have said more than that. Their dad forced them to use his card? The whole story is odd. No need to get aggressive.", "(bangs head on desk)\n\nSeriously. \n\nYou simply cannot read the OP? Unable? CANNOT DO IT?\n\nOP states that she worded it, AND I QUOTE, \"AS IF I WAS GOING TO PAY\".\n\nWhat in that do you not understand and STILL want to talk about?", "Just because OP perceives something as such, doesn't mean it is reality.

She wanted things 50/50 and you\u2019re following her wish.", "NTA! She clearly invited you so she could split the Uber ride. Which is messed up. \n\nShe also shouldn\u2019t expected someone else to pay for her food. When you go out with friends and they ask you if you want something, you ask them how much it was or ask for the receipt to pay them back. If they say don\u2019t worry about it or it\u2019s on me that\u2019s when they offered to pay. That person usually pays them back by buying the food next time. \n\nYou clearly need to talk to your friend and make things clear. If you like hanging out with that person let that be known but tell her that you are not in a financially good position. You do like hanging out with her but  if it involves money to let you know to make sure you can afford it.  You could also make an arrangement to buy groceries at the same time so that way you don\u2019t pay for an Uber ride you just accompanied her for.", "Yta your friend did something you thought was rude.

All u did was follow the AH footsteps", "ESH, couple \u2018broke\u2019 folks showing why they are broke wasting stupid cash cause they can\u2019t plan for shit.\n\nIf, you didn\u2019t lead with the \u2018poor me I have no money\u2019 story it would be a NTA situation.", "You're an asshole", "No it\u2019s why they are both poor", "Yeah\u2026isn\u2019t it normal to split the Uber/taxi fee? If OP didn\u2019t want to pay she could have not gone shopping?", "What?  In what way does OP suck here?  Friend set precedent, OP followed, friend pulled SURPRISED PIKACHU FACE when asked to pay for her $50 DD.\n\n\"Im getting DD, you want something\" doesnt sound like \"my treat\" when the persons order will be 50 bucks.", "When I would drive my roommate to the grocery store with me on my shopping trip, I would never tell her to pay me for the gas. I was going there anyway, so taking her along didn't incur any extra expenses. \n\nIf the friend was already planning to take an uber and invited OP along, it's pretty rude to demand half the cost **after** the trip. They needed to talk about that beforehand so OP could actually decide whether or not she wanted to spend that money. When I'm tight on cash, I would definitely turn down any trip that requires me to spend $30+ for transportation. It would have been polite for OP to offer some money towards the uber, but that would be based on what she could comfortably afford", "Nah he says broke, but people with money are still looking up at the people with even more money. I wouldn't even consider a 100$ food bill for one meal. That's two weeks of groceries for two people.. In one meal.\n\nEven if its on his dads card, that is its own \"wealth\" to have access to.\n\nSometimes I wonder what words mean to some people cause, I know that word, but that's not that word. Broke is in 12 hours the power goes off, the fridge has a half full box of baking soda, from when shit where flush and needed any odor control, and some green onions and  wondering if those can make something with enough calories to get you to break at your shift where the free coffee and stale crackers sustain your being.\n\nThis dude is privilaged irresponsible, not broke.", "NTA, but if you are broke why are you ordering 100$ takeouts and taking 70$ Ubers in the first place. You should be saving up money.", "i guess i\u2019ve just never taken an uber or taxi or anything similar without the understanding being that it would be split evenly, i don\u2019t own a car and can\u2019t drive so i don\u2019t really have as much experience with that kind of thing so it hadn\u2019t occurred to me.\nI can see your point, i think for me i just have a general understanding amongst my friends that unless someone says \u201ci\u2019ll pay\u201d that it\u2019s going to be split evenly.", "Because OP specifically asked in way that she could assume it was an invitation.\n\nYTA", "OP ordered food because their dad insisted they use his card. OP went for an Uber ride because their friend wanted a companion on a trip she was already taking, and since the Uber would (presumably...I don't use it often enough to know) cost the same or similar with one passenger or two, OP didn't think they'd have to pay when they were initially invited out on a trip where they were basically just there because their friend didn't want to shop alone or whatever.", "OP said dad was paying for their food.", "Usually we will agree that it's split, but there have been a few times where my friends offered me the spare seat in their uber when I was planning to walk home. No one asked me to pay, but I definitely baked them something nice or bought them a bottle of wine as a thank you. Of course, this was max a $10 uber, not $70 round trip."]}
