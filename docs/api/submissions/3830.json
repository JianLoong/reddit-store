Anyway, earlier today, I got a text from my friend asking me to come with her to the store to buy some Christmas gifts for her family. Both of us don\u2019t have a car so we had to Uber there and back. The cost going was $32, coming back was $36, so $68 in total. After we got back to her place, she sent me an Apple Pay request charge of $34. I was confused as to why because she\u2019s the one that asked me to come with her. I thought since we didn\u2019t plan on going together and because I didn\u2019t want to go in the first place, I didn\u2019t have to pay for the ride. I mentioned to her, \u201cwhy did you send the request?\u201d She said \u201cwell, we both took the same Uber to go there and come back, so\u2026\u201d. I was a bit upset but I sent her the money anyway. Later during the night, I told her I was going to order food (my dad made me use his card). I asked her if she wanted anything, but I had asked in a way to make it seems as if I was going to pay, just like, \u201chey, I\u2019m gonna order food, want anything?\u201d. She said yes. My order was $34.27 and hers was $47.56. With delivery fee and tip, it came up to $92.83 total. After the food came, she looked over and said \u201cthanks so much\u201d. I waited until we were both done eating and sent her an Apple Pay request for $53 (that includes her meal, half of delivery fee, and half tip). She got very upset with me and told me I was a b-word, she was going on and on about how she thought I was going to pay. I don\u2019t know, am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: I am a student. I understand that I could have simply used the money I had to buy groceries, but that would have been impossible for me. I live in a dorm hours away from home, my friends doesn\u2019t because her home is 10 minutes away. So I wouldn\u2019t have anywhere to cook a proper meal. \n\nYou might be thinking, why didn\u2019t cook at your friends place, I simply didn\u2019t want to do that because her parents weren\u2019t there and I didn\u2019t want to use their things without permission.\n\nMy definition of broke is probably different than yours. I have a few bucks in my savings, but that\u2019s for college bills that I can\u2019t touch. I had no money in my checking account because I had sent her the last of it for the Uber. \n\nYes, I understand that the food I ordered was expensive. In my defense, nothing here is cheap, food is overpriced and I thought if I order food that will last me a few days, it was worth it in the end.\n\nSecond Edit: She paid me back, the money was sent back to my dads account.", "created_utc": 1670054454, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbb5ld/aita_for_making_my_friend_pay_for_her_own_ubereats/", "score": 836, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They knew how costly it was and thought this would be a great way to cut down half the cost. Both of them just need to communicate better. \"Hey do you need to do any shopping? I've got to go to the store and we could split the cost of the uber and both get our shopping done.\" I also can't ever imagine being a person that needs to split an uber bill but then also ordering $50 worth of food on someone else and not expecting to pay it. That's insane.", "i\u2019m gonna just make a disclaimer and say that i\u2019m autistic and i strongly feel like that\u2019s contributing towards how i\u2019m seeing this, i wouldn\u2019t have ever picked up on the intention or the way it was implied and i can\u2019t really figure out how someone would imply it in that way, but in saying that i\u2019m acknowledging that it\u2019s likely that my brain just doesn\u2019t pick up on that stuff.\nI think for me in this situation i would have split the taxi and paid for my portion of the food and seen nothing wrong with the situation but i guess that\u2019s down to how i think and how myself and my friends and family generally operate.", "Assumption makes an ass out of u and me", "I actually think the two situations are quite different.  \n\nLike, if I invite someone to ride with me somewhere because I'm going anyway, I don't expect them to pitch in for gas.  If I plan a trip with someone else and we choose to use my vehicle, splitting gas is going to be part of the conversation just like splitting accommodations, the costs of tickets/activities, etc.   \n\nIf I say to someone \"I'm going to the Chinese buffet, want to come along?\" that doesn't give any indication I'm paying.  I think this is especially true when you're ordering food at a venue that will end up costing $50 with all costs included.  Sometimes I may grab the ticket at the end of the meal and say \"I got this one\", but if the venue is more pricey and/or the other person ordered something pricey, it shouldn't be expected that the other person will pay unless specified beforehand.", "If they don\u2019t have a ride to the store there\u2019s a possibility that to get there and back would end up eating up most of the $50 for shopping.", "Yeah, but if she's really that broke she would be asking her dad to buy her $50 in groceries instead of 1 single meal!", "Yeah, the friend was just running an errand and invited OP to come along (the post words it as \"asked me to come with her,\" so I'm not even sure if it was an invite or a request.)  I've gone shopping with friends before, with either of us driving, in situations that are less \"let's go to the mall together!\" and more \"Come with me while I run errands so that I'm not bored.\"  I go with my friend because we are hanging out and talking together, not because I actually NEED to go to the store or want to buy anything.  We don't talk about splitting gas costs in those situations regardless of who drove (to be fair, I usually don't hit up friends for gas costs anyway, but I'm sure that would change if I was frequently driving them around places).  It sounds like OP thought it was just a \"come hang out with me\" situation, since she didn't actually care about going to the store otherwise.  While the friend either thought she was doing OP a favor by inviting her along (\"We can go to the store and shop for presents together,\"), or really just wanted someone else to help eat the cost of the Uber.

Too many people judge poor people for their spending habits, expect them to cut out all joy, get 3 jobs, etc etc and live a miserable existence until they hit the magical number and stop being poor.\n\nThat's my problem, and that's what the comment I replied to sounded like.", "Joy doesn\u2019t have a price tag.
