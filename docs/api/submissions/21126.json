She helps contribute to meals, does her own thing, stays out of our space, and doesn\u2019t expect to spend 24/7 with us.

They typically don\u2019t stay in the same room with the oldest (9) and he wanders around and wakes others up to hang out. They also don\u2019t contribute, so we would be footing the bill any time we cook meals to feed 6 additional people and helping to keep an eye on and entertaining the kids. \n\nI told my husband I don\u2019t have the bandwidth to manage all of this and entertain them while here (I work full time from home). I would be working some of the Christmas holiday. \n\nHe says because we have the rooms (we have one dedicated guest room a basement living room) they should be allowed . If I worked upstairs (vacate my office which is next to the guest room) and got air mattresses we could make it work. My sister stays so why can\u2019t his brother?\n\nHe understands the extra burden, but feels guilty because he thinks his brother *might* not be able to come for Christmas if we don\u2019t let them stay at our house. \n\nI don\u2019t want to stop him from coming to Christmas\u2026 but I don\u2019t think we should be the assumed free hotel with meal service. \n\nSo, lay it on me\u2026 am I the asshole for saying his brother can\u2019t stay with us for Christmas holiday even though technically we have the space for them?", "created_utc": 1688266463, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14od74h/aita_for_not_letting_certain_inlaws_stay_with_us/", "score": 65, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he\u2019s so dead set on them staying, he needs to set boundaries and make it clear that you\u2019re not there to entertain them and cook for everyone. Infact, since they don\u2019t have to pay for a hotel they can help with food. And set a limit for how long they can be there. Weeks is unacceptable.", "You are NTA.  \n\nIndeed, you would be foolish and ever so slightly into undermining your own well-being were you, a work-at-home mom with a tiny child, to invite a family of 6 with 4 small children -- 4 children they don't bother to supervise and need to be cooked for and cleaned up after because the parents don't contribute or pitch in or act responsible because, hey, it's hotel OP and you're the maid , chef, and ATM -- to stay with you for several weeks.\n\nThis is not about your bandwidth, this is about an unacceptable imposition to anyone.  Except possibly for the grandparents if they have a lot of room, money, and domestic staff.\n\nStand up to your husband.  This is a NO.  Even if the brother promises to watch his kids.  (He won't.)  Or promises they'll help around the house.  (They won't.)  Or to cover the expenses they incur.  (They won't.) If these were helpful, considerate people, they would have been helpful and considerate last time they visited.\n\nNo.  Not this Christmas.  Not ever.", "NAH. Your sister is an ideal guest who doesn\u2019t overstay or take advantage. Opposite of BIL\u2019s entourage and extended stay and intrusion on your lives in multiple ways. Unless your husband is planning on taking vacation the entire visit to supervise, shop, cook, clean and entertain the entire visit (besides a couple of days for the actual holiday) while you work from home, the answer is no.  Or he can pay for you to stay at a hotel during their visit so you can work when you need to and relax on your own vacation. Welcome them for a long weekend but you need limits. Otherwise you\u2019ll have relationship issues with each other and resentments to bil you can avoid if they stay elsewhere.", "NTA. Technically, you have the space. Practically, you don't, and it would be a madhouse.\n\nAgain, in theory, your husband could be in charge of keeping that madhouse in check, letting you avoid any extra work. In practice you (and your husband, if he's honest) know that's not about to happen.", "NTA, but there may be better solutions than just saying no. Set some rules. #1 - extra food is expensive. They give you $200 on day one to cover extra food.  #2 - the kids have to be supervised. That means no running around the house and staying out of your office. #3 - you are not everyone\u2019s cook. Set a schedule for who cooks meals. #4 - they turn into pumpkins in 10 days and have to leave.", "I\u2019m flipping out just imagining this \u2018holiday\u2019. You have to work from home AND host the holidays which will include what, 7 guests in your home ? The cooking, cleaning, organizing activities, decorating etc etc. would be stressful even if the brother was a hands on parent and easy guest. I\u2019m too much of a tired coward to take this on.", "NTA - your house, your rules. Good luck with explaining to your family why you allow certain family members are okay to stay yours, but others are not allowed. That sounds like a fun conversation to have.", "NAH. \n\nI think the only way to compromise here though is that no one stays unless it is a special exception with both of you agreeing. So no brother means no sister.", "ESH. OP you are damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. In my humble opinion your husband feels slighted by you. Your sister is welcome to stay whereas his brother is not. If you indicate that you will no longer entertain having guests then everyone would be treated fairly. In addition, you have a perfect good excuse to keep everyone away at Christmas because your new baby will be born. \n\nIf you don\u2019t listen to your husband\u2019s concerns he will eventually begin to resent you. Then, there will be problems in your marriage. Do you really want this? The biggest problem I have with your comments is you seem to think your decision is the only one that matters and your husband has no say. You can keep down this path of dictatorship or you can foster a partnership. Your choice. Good luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Imo the best way to avoid a fight, is let it happen one time. Your husband will get annoyed all on his own with the big addition over time. Sometimes it's a lesson you need to physically learn. Don't  attend to the kids and let them act how they want, the parents will do what they will. Take this time to try to get to know the family better and make a connection to the ones less familiar, and just be your best self. while you can. Life is short and eventually family get togethers  will be a thing of the past. As long as they aren't exceedingly toxic, just ride this one out. And see how hubby is feeling.  Then. Maybe once this happens again in the future, you'll have solid reasoning", "Nta. Given the history of your inlaws you have the solid reason not to. If your husband insists tell him youll not help them in anyway including food and children and cleaning. He can help if he wants but you wont. Same way you treat you sister when she stays with you", "NTA\n\nIt has nothing to do with space.\n\nYour sister is the ideal guest, but this BIL is a circus of out-of-control kids and a lot of money spent on food.\n\nThere is no comparison.\n\nThis is a hill you have to die on. If your husband goes ahead with this visit, pack up and move out. Let your husband do all that cooking and laundry, because his family certainly won't.", "NTA. You WFH, there is no reason for kids to be at your house that long. There is a reason your child is at daycare while you work. His kids should not be around. I bet you do most of the cooking and cleaning too. Your husband needs a serious reality check about this BS. Stick to your boundaries and point out that a whole ass loud, mooching family is not allowed over your one adult sister who handles who own food and isn't a massive fucking burden on you", "NAH, it\u2019s not unreasonable he would want his family to stay too. I would suggest that you say that his brother has to follow the same rules your sister does.", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s the asshole, but I know he will feel like the asshole to tell his brother now (we\u2019re ruining Christmas because now his brother has nowhere to stay!) and the familial guilt is strong.", "Brilliant idea! More room too if I\u2019m at the hotel. This is how to win the situation!", "So here\u2019s the thing - his other out of town sibling (28) had a wife that are welcome to stay if they visit for the weekend. His parents could (but usually don\u2019t) because multiple children live here so they try to stay in a central location (grandparents) to make life easier. \n\nThe issue is the party size (and compounded by parenting choices). At max, if my family comes it\u2019s a maximum of 2-3 people sharing one room. The other BIL is 2 people sharing room. In-laws, same thing 2 people sharing one room. \n\n6 people sharing 2-3 rooms/shared spaces is an imposition. Especially when it\u2019s for 2+ weeks and not just a long weekend. \n\nI\u2019m a logical person, so if *I* have to have the conversation I\u2019m willing to be the bad guy. But it\u2019s just drama we wish they could understand without us being the grinch who ruined Christmas.", "Fair points - but to clarify (I did in another comment) it\u2019s not his side of the family that is blocked. His parents, his other brother (younger, married, no children) have asked to stay for short durations and are more than welcome to. \n\nThis one is different because of the sheer number of bodies, accommodations, etc we will have to make. His other siblings have asked to stay when they have work trips and that\u2019s fine. \n\nHusband understands the reasoning, but i think it\u2019s hard for him because this specific brother is the only one with children. The thought is he may feel left out since \u201ceveryone else\u201d can stay. But it\u2019s not about the brother, but the guest count. It\u2019s further compounded by the fact that it will mean his brother would have to pay to come out for Christmas and have a place to stay.", "Put away all the valuables before they arrive. OP should refuse to do extra house work if they are pigs, let hubby pick up the slack. And the mess.", "Tell your husband that the brother can stay if your *husband* does all the cooking, gets his brother to cough up the money for food, and tends all the children. And that they all stay in the one guest room, and your office is off limits, and the house QUIET during your work hours. He needs to stay home to facilitate this. Or, better yet, they need to leave the house during work hours.", "This loser and his loser family staying with you for THREE WEEKS will ruin your Christmas. \n\nNTA.", "How would you get away to a hotel if you have a new baby due in December though?   \n\nOr do you mean you expect to be pregnant then?", "Exactly. Too many people, too long of a stay.", "Also will say, being passive we could say oh Brother X already asked if he could stay (because big brother will not ask from experience) we don\u2019t have room. But then the older brother will say Well I\u2019d have to pay more so I should get to stay at your house. It\u2019s just you and your wife.", "You are having a baby right at Christmas and that\u2019s enough reason to block everyone from coming to stay. Do you really want your newborn exposed to germs from people? My doctor once told me that it takes 18 months for a newborn to develop an immune system. That\u2019s why many doctors highly recommend breastfeeding because mother\u2019s milk provides the nutrients from the mother (I\u2019m not trying to get you to breastfeed. That\u2019s totally your decision). However, I still firmly believe that if one person is blocked then all  potential guests should be blocked except anyone who is coming to help you out with the baby.\n\nOP, you do you because you are the one who has to deal with this but if you don\u2019t handle this situation correctly you are going to have a lot of problems and not just from bil but eventually from husband as well. Once again, good luck!", "NTA\n\nIf your husband insists on doing this, rent and Airbnb away from this mess but close enough to festivities so as to avoid the BIL. Let husband foot the physical and mental work for this stay. It's a nice simple alternative. If BIL stays, you will go. Everyone gets to make choices.", "Info:\nWhy does the trip have to be so long?\n\nWhy doesn't BIL contribute to food? Why is that not part of the conversation? Or watching their kids?\n\nYou don't have to say No. You CAN say that the trip can be shorter, BIL will pay for his family's food and activities, and that they cannot bother you while you are working--the parents need to be in the same room as their children and make sure they aren't being too loud, or go elsewhere.", "Yes yes yes. It\u2019s your home and not your family that you wanted to stay anyway, they don\u2019t get to infringe in your office space. \n\nHusband needs to tend to all his family needs if he wants them to stay", "She said pregnant", "As someone who shared a twin bed all the time until I was 5 and as needed for a number of years after, kids under four don't need either own beds. If they want to stay, they get the downstairs living room (mom and dad too), contribute to food, watch their children, and linger for a set time of 7 days MAX. Your husband can take the time off to play eager host, since it's so important to him. NTA", "Tell DH he has to take off work and manage/wrangle them the ENTIRE time they are there.  No disturbing your work.  No extra clean up for you.  He makes brother contribute to food costs for their 6 and they help cook and clean.  They are family and guests, BUT they are not on vacation with you as the staff.  Only if DH agrees to this do you consider otherwise fill that space with any of his family who would be good guests so you aren\u2019t turning his family away, just the assholes.", "Your husband is comparing apples and oranges. NTA stand your ground", "NAH I will say though it\u2019s weird to offer to host Christmas and not expect to have out of town family assume they can stay at yours for the visit", "It sounds like they\u2019ve never actually stayed and  she made all those assumptions herself without even giving them a chance first"]}
