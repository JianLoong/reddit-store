{"id": 32981, "submission_id": "18hwqsc", "title": "AITA for kicking my sister\u2019s fiance out for continuing to vape in my house after being asked not to?", "selftext": "\nMy roommates and I let my sister (22) her fiance (22) and their 3 week old baby move in with us because they were homeless after the baby was born. The fiance vapes and our one rule was that he does not vape in the house, he needs to go outside. My sister agreed and said he would do it outside. \n\nA few days into them being here I had suspicions that he was vaping in the house, I would hear him suddenly coughing like he does right after he vapes, I smelled it coming from their window when I went out to take the trash. I didn\u2019t confront him because I didn\u2019t want to assume, but we have indoor cameras so that we can watch our dogs and sure enough I saw him doing it inside. I approached him and reminded him that our one ask was that he not vape in the house and to take it outside. Fast forward a day or so, he did it again. I sat down with them and explained that our one rule wasn\u2019t that difficult and at this point they\u2019re both disrespecting our home. I told him next time he does it inside, I won\u2019t ask him to stop I will ask him to leave my house. \nYesterday, they were home alone and I get a notification on my camera and see him with the vape in his mouth but then looks up at the camera, turns away and walks to the garage. It was clear he forgot there was a camera and thought he could get away with it. I wasn\u2019t comfortable confronting them while no one was home so first thing this morning I asked him to leave based on him failing to follow our one rule yet again. I asked my sister and the baby to stay because it\u2019s not the babies fault he messed this up for them, I ended up having to contact local PD to come out and make him leave my house. My sister went with him and left the baby here with me and they are claiming I am the asshole for separating their family by forcing him to leave.\n\nA little background on them, they have gotten kicked out from 3 places prior to them coming to stay with us. His grandparents, his parents, and her parents, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and try for the babies sake. My sister is currently on maternity leave, she is getting Cashaid, foodstamps and disability. The fiance is not working. The goal for them staying with us was that they would have a safe place while they saved up money to get their own place and get on their feet. We provided them with their own room, essential items for the baby because they didn\u2019t have anything, full access to the house, and we watched the baby when they needed a break. We provided him with a bike so that he can go out and look for jobs but he had very little desire to do so. He would sleep until 2-3pm in the afternoon then sit around playing video games for the rest of the day.. We genuinely wanted to help them learn to be better but he couldn\u2019t follow our one simple rule.

I\u2019d of done the same and then when they abandoned the kid like that be the last straw. They not only chose something as stupid as taking vape outside over a house but over their kid too. Jesus", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. The fiance sounds like a typical deadbeat loser and your sister abandoning her baby to chase after said deadbeat is a MASSIVE red flag. As others have said, I'd get CPS involved for the babies sake. As someone with experience in this field, it is extremely easy to find a good home for a baby. It will only get more difficult to find a good home as they get older and if they remain in the system it will chew them up and spit them out. Better to save the child from their parents now while their prospects are promising.", "NTA. Your house your rules.", "NTA. No doubts.\n\nGet kicked out from 3 different places and you still don't have any bit of thought \"Maybe I'm doing something wrong?\". \n\nYou went above and beyond for them, it's probably their own pride that is holding them back in life and they will have to learn that the hard way. They got a 4th chance, some people don't even get their 2nd.", "NTA. It's not that hard to go vape outside. It sounds like he didn't even try to follow your only rule.", "NTA. He is. Assuming he's \"in charge\", Sis needs to get away from him for her and her baby's sakes.", "NTA. He can afford dope/ tobacco and not baby essentials? That tells you his priorities right there.", "Your sister's Fiance is just being petty now. It takes 30 seconds to walk outside and vape. Also refusing to leave someone's house and making them get the police involved is crazy...", "NTA. Call CPS. That's abandonment. Let your parents/family know what's going on, in case they want to take care of the baby. It's apparent they aren't capable of caring for a newborn in any feasible capacity. Your roommates shouldn't be responsible for a baby, and this situation is dangerous for any child, but especially a newborn.", "NTA AND THEY LEFT THE BABY????? What kind of parents are they!", "I like how everyone on Reddit seems to think that calling CPS is going to wind up like the end of Matilda. There are 400k kids in the system and most experience extreme trauma, setting them up for a life of poverty, abuse, and potentially prison. If you call CPS, know what you are getting into because once the authorities are involved, there is no going back.", "NTA just change the locks when you do kick them out. You know why they haven't been able to secure housing. Also not your kid not your problem. Check your valuables too, they might have walked away.", "NTA. You set a reasonable rule and gave him plenty of chances to follow it. Apparently having a place to stay just doesn\u2019t matter that much to him.", "NTA. Contact social services because they abandoned the baby. File for custody of the baby or hep the baby find a good home.", "NTA\n\nFAFO", "NTA. Your house, your rules. He\u2019s disrespectful.", "NTA.", "NTA. He's the AH for choosing vaping over a safe home with his family. And your sister is an AH for choosing nothing with him over safety with her baby.

People can vape inside in their own home but not at someone else's. He had more than one warning and chose to ignore it. It's sad that your sister is siding with him instead of the baby. I don't believe vaping is any healthier for a baby than smoking.", "You stated the rules.\n\nYou went over the rules again with them.\n\nYou enforced the rules.\n\nYou are in the clear.

Within the first 3 days of them being here they got their cashaid and he asked for a ride to the next town over to pick up his vapes. I told him no and that I had no interest in running him around to do something unnecessary like picking up his vapes and I told him he needed to learn how to be independent.

Call CPS.", "\nChild abandonment is a basis.", "If you did not consent to that child being left with you for an extended period of time then that cop is dead wrong. This child has been abandoned by your sister to be used as a bargaining chip.\n\nCall CPS. This is a dangerous amount of not caring about her child. Vaping around then and then just dumping the poor thing with you to *use against you*\n\nEdit: the cop also probably said that because he figured you are a safe person for the baby because a baby being safe does not mean it hasn't been abandoned.", "That's not true. CALL CPS and report it. Cops only think about the problem right now, not what happens in a week. I'm a mandatory reporter. That is textbook abandonment.", "Unless you didnt want to care for the child. Then its abandonment.", "Well...if they actually want custody. They live with roommates. Plus, custody of that child will mean the parents would be a constant threatening presence in their lives.", "Oh dear. That's a big old yellow flag there.\n\nI do wish your daughter had chosen to stay. Leaving the baby is... hard to comprehend. How are you moving forward with the situation, if I may ask?", "Do not call CPS unless you want custody, the kid could end up in foster care. Ppl on Reddit will suggest calling CPS over anything. Vaping around your kid is not great but nothing compared to the horrors they might experience in the system.", "These roomaates are like my sisters, we\u2019ve lived together for 10 years now. I don\u2019t have contact with my mom, haven\u2019t spoke to her in over 5 years and their family has pretty much taken me in. We all 3 would love custody of the baby because we know we can provide her with a good life and a family. The constant threat of not only them but my mother is a huge concern but it wouldn\u2019t stop me for trying for custody.", "In the us, op could be a benefit to roomies if they do", "My sister ended up coming back without him, her and the baby are both here for now at least. We want to help them both, we\u2019re hoping we can help her see he\u2019s a deadbeat and she and the baby are better off without him. At least until he grows up. But same thing applies, if she doesn\u2019t follow our expectations it\u2019ll suck but I\u2019ll have to have her leave too.", "If the OP doesn't want to care for the child then it's where it's going to end up anyway.  \n\nIf she's happy to care for the child then it will be legally done and the sister may not be able to just waltz in and take the child on a whim without a safe place for it.", "That's lovely. I hope you get it.", "I'm glad she came back. Either way you have a tough road ahead, I'll be sending positivity your way.", "NTA if your sister doesn't like it she can leave. Loser baby daddy spending his time getting high instead of providing for his family. She picked a real fucking winner. His own family is tired of his shit. Good job on installing cameras around your house and don't allow him in your home.", "NTA\n\n\"I did not separate anybody. Your fiance chose vaping over his kid. You can lie to yourself all you want, but that is what happened.\"", "NTA\n\nYou were generous enough to let these people stay. You had one simple rule. You didn't forbid him from vaping. All you asked him was to vape outside, which was perfectly reasonable. But he kept breaking that rule. He has only himself to blame.\n\n>they have gotten kicked out from 3 places prior to them coming to stay with us. His grandparents, his parents, and her parents\n\nYeah, that says it all. These people are terrible, ungrateful guests who you don't want to be around.", "The sister left the baby to go with the deadbeat bf. She chose him over the child and blamed OP for separating the family. Ok then.\n\nOP NTA. And you need to contact the authorities about tour sister abandoning her baby.", "You should call cps and then call an attorney because if something happens your not allowed to get the baby any sort of medical treatment or care.", "LOL...gawd!  Your sister calls you the AH when her slow minded boyfriend can't follow 1 simple rule.  Then she leaves the baby with you and takes off (for however long) with him???  -Oh boy.  Maybe  it's best for them to move along.", "NTA. \n\nAre they meth users or something?", "The boyfriend is a loser and an asshole. The sister is delusional and needs to learn how to act like a mother. NTA", "NTA. Give the baby back, or call CPS", "NTA. And now you know why they are homeless.", "NTA to start, but what got my attention was \"I ended up having to contact local PD to come out and make him leave my house. My sister went with him and left the baby here with me.\" Two issues there. 1) It was so hard to get your sister's fiance out you had to call the cops. 2) Your sister LEFT the baby with you?!!!! Might be time to call CPS. Looking at what you have written I don't feel supremely confident your sister and her fiance are the best caregivers for this child.", "NTA\n\nCall CPS immediately. They abandoned their child. Even if you want to keep the kid with you, CPS need to be told at once.", "NTA and your sister had a kid with a loser\u2026you could be on the hook for supporting her, babysitting etc. playing video games rather than getting a job and saving to move out", "Not the asshole", "Nta call cps she abandoned her child and get that poor baby away from the crappy parents the baby has. Get custody or find someone in your family or his willing to take the baby if you can't.", "I never understand these situations. You're providing a free place to live! A long time ago I smoked and lived with my aunt and uncle during college. They said I had to smoke outside and contain the butts a particular way. Duh! NTA", "Or a lawyer if op wants custody of the baby. The sister could have stayed with the baby. She chose the boyfriend over the baby. I dont want to hear but she made sure the baby was safe. That's true. But she should have stayed with her baby then instead of her boyfriend. Her first priority should have been the baby, she chose wrong. What mother does that?", "OP's sister and her fiance left their 3 week old infant behind because the fiance decided being able to vape in the house was more important than his newborn having a home and OP's sister decided that it was more important to be homeless with her boyfriend than to be with her baby.\n\nThis is exactly the time to get the authorities involved. These absolute trash human beings are not fit to be parents, clearly don't want to be parents, and I seriously worry about the baby dying of neglect if they decided they wanted to come back for him or her after all.\n\nBad foster care situations absolutely exist, and it's definitely a risk that CPS might remove the child from OP's home, but if OP wants custody of her nibling, she's going to have to involve authorities at some point.", "I\u2019m glad someone has said this.  I understand in some cases it\u2019s necessary and in this case it may be, but OP please exhaust all options before going this route (ie. talk to family, your sister).", "She picked the boyfriend who's already been kicked out of all his other options, and burned through several warnings he was about to be kicked from a very supportive situation. That poor baby doesn't have a great future with them so I hope OP or even social services can take the baby instead.", "They are not and that\u2019s the problem. 22 is very young for marriage and babies and they act like very young people. You can\u2019t expect them to become adult just because they hit 18. Some need a little more time - especially those who decide to marry and have a baby at that age. It\u2019s generally a sign of immaturity as they do it for all the wrong reasons, even if they manage better than this family.", "The police officer is wrong. The baby has been abandoned. That is NOT safe, and CPS NEEDS to know.\n\nPlease don't take legal advice from the police. They are frequently wrong even about the laws they regularly enforce, and are totally clueless about the laws they don't interact with routinely.\n\nI guarantee that they just wanted to leave a 'domestic' dispute rather than stay and do more paperwork and arrest the parents for child abandonment."]}
