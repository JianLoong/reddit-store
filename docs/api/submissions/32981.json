{"id": 32981, "submission_id": "18hwqsc", "title": "AITA for kicking my sister\u2019s fiance out for continuing to vape in my house after being asked not to?", "selftext": "\nMy roommates and I let my sister (22) her fiance (22) and their 3 week old baby move in with us because they were homeless after the baby was born. The fiance vapes and our one rule was that he does not vape in the house, he needs to go outside. My sister agreed and said he would do it outside. \n\nA few days into them being here I had suspicions that he was vaping in the house, I would hear him suddenly coughing like he does right after he vapes, I smelled it coming from their window when I went out to take the trash. I didn\u2019t confront him because I didn\u2019t want to assume, but we have indoor cameras so that we can watch our dogs and sure enough I saw him doing it inside. I approached him and reminded him that our one ask was that he not vape in the house and to take it outside. Fast forward a day or so, he did it again. I sat down with them and explained that our one rule wasn\u2019t that difficult and at this point they\u2019re both disrespecting our home. I told him next time he does it inside, I won\u2019t ask him to stop I will ask him to leave my house. \nYesterday, they were home alone and I get a notification on my camera and see him with the vape in his mouth but then looks up at the camera, turns away and walks to the garage. It was clear he forgot there was a camera and thought he could get away with it. I wasn\u2019t comfortable confronting them while no one was home so first thing this morning I asked him to leave based on him failing to follow our one rule yet again. I asked my sister and the baby to stay because it\u2019s not the babies fault he messed this up for them, I ended up having to contact local PD to come out and make him leave my house. My sister went with him and left the baby here with me and they are claiming I am the asshole for separating their family by forcing him to leave.\n\nA little background on them, they have gotten kicked out from 3 places prior to them coming to stay with us. His grandparents, his parents, and her parents, but we decided to give them the benefit of the doubt and try for the babies sake. My sister is currently on maternity leave, she is getting Cashaid, foodstamps and disability. The fiance is not working. The goal for them staying with us was that they would have a safe place while they saved up money to get their own place and get on their feet. We provided them with their own room, essential items for the baby because they didn\u2019t have anything, full access to the house, and we watched the baby when they needed a break. We provided him with a bike so that he can go out and look for jobs but he had very little desire to do so. He would sleep until 2-3pm in the afternoon then sit around playing video games for the rest of the day.. We genuinely wanted to help them learn to be better but he couldn\u2019t follow our one simple rule.

I\u2019d of done the same and then when they abandoned the kid like that be the last straw. They not only chose something as stupid as taking vape outside over a house but over their kid too. Jesus", "Absolutely NTA.", "NTA.", "NTA. The fiance sounds like a typical deadbeat loser and your sister abandoning her baby to chase after said deadbeat is a MASSIVE red flag. As others have said, I'd get CPS involved for the babies sake. As someone with experience in this field, it is extremely easy to find a good home for a baby. It will only get more difficult to find a good home as they get older and if they remain in the system it will chew them up and spit them out. Better to save the child from their parents now while their prospects are promising.", "NTA. Your house your rules.", "NTA. No doubts.\n\nGet kicked out from 3 different places and you still don't have any bit of thought \"Maybe I'm doing something wrong?\". \n\nYou went above and beyond for them, it's probably their own pride that is holding them back in life and they will have to learn that the hard way. They got a 4th chance, some people don't even get their 2nd.", "NTA. It's not that hard to go vape outside. It sounds like he didn't even try to follow your only rule.", "NTA. He is. Assuming he's \"in charge\", Sis needs to get away from him for her and her baby's sakes.", "NTA. He can afford dope/ tobacco and not baby essentials? That tells you his priorities right there.", "Your sister's Fiance is just being petty now. It takes 30 seconds to walk outside and vape. Also refusing to leave someone's house and making them get the police involved is crazy...", "NTA. Call CPS. That's abandonment. Let your parents/family know what's going on, in case they want to take care of the baby. It's apparent they aren't capable of caring for a newborn in any feasible capacity. Your roommates shouldn't be responsible for a baby, and this situation is dangerous for any child, but especially a newborn.", "NTA AND THEY LEFT THE BABY????? What kind of parents are they!", "I like how everyone on Reddit seems to think that calling CPS is going to wind up like the end of Matilda. There are 400k kids in the system and most experience extreme trauma, setting them up for a life of poverty, abuse, and potentially prison. If you call CPS, know what you are getting into because once the authorities are involved, there is no going back.", "NTA just change the locks when you do kick them out. You know why they haven't been able to secure housing. Also not your kid not your problem. Check your valuables too, they might have walked away.", "NTA. You set a reasonable rule and gave him plenty of chances to follow it. Apparently having a place to stay just doesn\u2019t matter that much to him.", "NTA. Contact social services because they abandoned the baby. File for custody of the baby or hep the baby find a good home.", "NTA\n\nFAFO", "NTA. Your house, your rules. He\u2019s disrespectful.", "NTA.", "NTA. He's the AH for choosing vaping over a safe home with his family. And your sister is an AH for choosing nothing with him over safety with her baby. At some point, it becomes abandonment. What is the plan for this child? Have you heard from her?", "NTA call police and report them for abandoning their baby. Literally your sis would rather be with her vaping bf than care for her baby...", "NTA your house, your rules. End of discussion.", "NTA.\n\nThis is his own doing.", "NTA\n\nI hate to be all judgy... but let me put on my judgy pants.\n\nShe chose a guy over her 3 week old baby?\n\nOh, my judgy pants are on fire!", "NTA. People can vape inside in their own home but not at someone else's. He had more than one warning and chose to ignore it. It's sad that your sister is siding with him instead of the baby. I don't believe vaping is any healthier for a baby than smoking.", "You stated the rules.\n\nYou went over the rules again with them.\n\nYou enforced the rules.\n\nYou are in the clear.  Though it sounds like you might need to plan for their kid...", "NTA your house your rules. If they can't respect your house, then they don't deserve to be there.", "And the baby deserves clean air. He can\u2019t make that one sacrifice for his baby?", "NTA. He only had one rule not to break and he broke it repeatedly.", "I can't imagine what was going through their minds.", "They are grown adults who should\u2019ve been taking care of themselves", "They are just not respecting your house and rules.", "The cops were still here and aware that she was choosing to leave her with me, he told me there was no basis for contacting CPS because the baby was safe.", "I agree. OP needs to call CPS they are a disaster and that poor baby is not safe with them.", "I agree and file for custody", "I mean they both have responsibility for that kid. If he hasn't come back for the baby he has abandoned it as much as the sister has.", "Exactly why we were pushing for him to get a job. And they get $700/month in cashaid, only $200 of that goes towards bills, we wanted them to save the $500 remaining minus whatever the baby needed.", "That was my issue. Within the first 3 days of them being here they got their cashaid and he asked for a ride to the next town over to pick up his vapes. I told him no and that I had no interest in running him around to do something unnecessary like picking up his vapes and I told him he needed to learn how to be independent. He ended up paying for an Uber to go get them \ud83d\ude12", "He can't make that one sacrifice *for himself*, let alone someone else.\n\nNTA", "Cops are *frequently* wrong about the law, particularly when it's not something they deal with on a daily basis. Call CPS.", "\nChild abandonment is a basis.", "If you did not consent to that child being left with you for an extended period of time then that cop is dead wrong. This child has been abandoned by your sister to be used as a bargaining chip.\n\nCall CPS. This is a dangerous amount of not caring about her child. Vaping around then and then just dumping the poor thing with you to *use against you*\n\nEdit: the cop also probably said that because he figured you are a safe person for the baby because a baby being safe does not mean it hasn't been abandoned.", "That's not true. CALL CPS and report it. Cops only think about the problem right now, not what happens in a week. I'm a mandatory reporter. That is textbook abandonment.", "Unless you didnt want to care for the child. Then its abandonment.", "Well...if they actually want custody. They live with roommates. Plus, custody of that child will mean the parents would be a constant threatening presence in their lives.", "Oh dear. That's a big old yellow flag there.\n\nI do wish your daughter had chosen to stay. Leaving the baby is... hard to comprehend. How are you moving forward with the situation, if I may ask?", "Do not call CPS unless you want custody, the kid could end up in foster care. Ppl on Reddit will suggest calling CPS over anything. Vaping around your kid is not great but nothing compared to the horrors they might experience in the system.", "These roomaates are like my sisters, we\u2019ve lived together for 10 years now. I don\u2019t have contact with my mom, haven\u2019t spoke to her in over 5 years and their family has pretty much taken me in. We all 3 would love custody of the baby because we know we can provide her with a good life and a family. The constant threat of not only them but my mother is a huge concern but it wouldn\u2019t stop me for trying for custody.", "In the us, op could be a benefit to roomies if they do", "My sister ended up coming back without him, her and the baby are both here for now at least. We want to help them both, we\u2019re hoping we can help her see he\u2019s a deadbeat and she and the baby are better off without him. At least until he grows up. But same thing applies, if she doesn\u2019t follow our expectations it\u2019ll suck but I\u2019ll have to have her leave too.", "If the OP doesn't want to care for the child then it's where it's going to end up anyway.  \n\nIf she's happy to care for the child then it will be legally done and the sister may not be able to just waltz in and take the child on a whim without a safe place for it.", "That's lovely. I hope you get it.", "I'm glad she came back. Either way you have a tough road ahead, I'll be sending positivity your way."]}
