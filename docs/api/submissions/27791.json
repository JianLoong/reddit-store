While my wife was pregnant and during the first few months after birth, she agreed with me. Later, my in-laws visited us, and she visited them a few times and suddenly she changed her decision and now wants to have this ceremony. Or rather, she wants to do it for her parents. I am against this, because it celebrates the orthodox hierarchy system and all the hypocrisy it comes with it.\n\nA year or so back, my wife agreed to it as I wanted my son to be out of this age-old orthodox mindset and to be better than that. I lengthily spoke to all my family members about why I want to opt out and why I have another opinion and that I want my son to grow in a different and a better way. Now, if I do it (because of their pressure), I will be a laughing stock as my words mean nothing and it would just be seen as an immature rant.\n\nAdditionally, this ceremony must be done by the father as the mother has no rights (a patriarchal mindset). So, I am in a way, just the last piece in the puzzle. It was also shocking to hear that my wife is ok with the patriarchal mindset for this ceremony because it makes her parents happy.To summarize, I am the only one not happy about it and everyone is angry at me for making a big fuss about it.

It's a bit of a joke if the father has to be bullied into this ceremony, whatever it is.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife needs to realize that making her parents happy can not be her first priority anymore. Her child and her husband need to come first.", "NTA. I don't think children should be forced to undergo religious ceremonies they neither understand nor can consent meaningfully to.", "NTA. It is fair for you to be able to choose what religion (if any) you want to expose *your* child to. It would be really frustrating for your partner to at first support you, and then switch teams as soon as she talks to her parents about it. If she is only doing this to appease her parents, then it's even worse.", "NTA.\n\nDon't do stuff that doesn't sit right with you, especially when it involves your children.", "Absolutely NTA.  This should really be a \"two yes, one no\" situation - that is, you only proceed with it if both parents say yes, if one says yes, end of.\n\nAnd no, your inlaws do not get a vote. They can express their opinion, you can hear them out....And then it's down to you and your wife.", "NTA, your wife agreed with you and for whatever reason, changed her mind afterwards. It was agreed the entire time that you would not do this ceremony, and I think she should respect your wishes, and decision, to not want to be a part of it. Sure, talking things over if she changed her mind is okay, but to then join with everyone else in trying to pressure you to do something you don't agree with and you voiced your uninterest in the first place, so that should be respected, imo", "NTA. Never compromise on what is best for your son to appease others. Not even your wife and especially not your inlaws. \n\nAlso if they actually believed this  the othodox system then they would respect your choice. Their subversion of it for their own priorities is more damaging and disrespectful to that system then your outright refusal.", "NTA\n\nAlong with everything else the other commenters have said, u already had an agreement with ur wife.", "NTA.  Your wife initially agreed, before your son was born, not to engage in the ceremony.  She was obviously pressured by her family after our son was born to change her mind.  She needs to establish boundaries with her family on issues like this.  The positive thing is that you said that the ceremony needs your participation - so if you say no, then that should be the end of it.  \n\nThat said, be aware your in-laws will probably do all they can to indoctrinate your son whenever they are around him.", "Patriarchal mindset that\u2019s funny you need to use that against them which means you need tell them hell no and to F off you ain\u2019t doing that if they give you shit tell them they are banned from seeing your family for ever then get your wife in check tell her she is not allowed contact of any kind with anybody except you that\u2019s a patriarchal mind set your family would be very proud of you for putting your foot down NTA", "Info: what ceremony? What religion? What does it demand of you ?", "NTA.", "It is up to you and your wife to decide how to bring up your son. Assuming that your wife was happy for the ceremony not to go ahead, she has had pressure brought to bear and has given in to it for the sake of family unity /tradition. It's up to you whether you take part in the ceremony. Is it something that you can just pay lip service to? Go through the motions to keep the peace, but not actually let it affect your son's upbringing.", "Well the only people's say who matter is yours and your wife's, as the parents. I would stand my ground if I were you as it's something that you specifically have to do and you don't want to do it.

Not theirs. \n\nNTA", "Nta but... \n\nIn my opinion, you should not be focussed on looking immature at all. That should not be the reason behind your choice.  I know that's not the only reason at all, but it does sound like a large part of why you don't want to change your mind (aside from your other more valid - given your world-views - perspective) is because you don't want to lose face.  And that, ironically, sounds immature.\n\nYour other reasons are fair, especially as it's you that has to do it despite being most against it, and given your wife seemed to be on board with you previously.  \n\nFor the well-being of your relationship with your wife (no matter the final outcome) - it is worth checking in with her whether she really was on board with you back then, or was actually uncertain or felt pressured by (or was indifferent and so differed to) your strong  opinion. \n\nOr, has she now actually changed her mind (or firmed up what she was unsure of before) in terms of what she actually thinks about the ceremony and what it means (she is allowed to, by the way... not that this makes th situation easier... but she is... we all are allowed to change our minds, though we have to weigh that against what was previously agreed)... or is she just caving in because she wants to keep family happy, but doesn't actually care (it's symbolism holds no power to her)?  In which case maybe thinking she can convince you that it's just for show, no big deal... and thus keep all parties happy (on balance, if she can bring you round to this view).  \n\nIf you can have the conversation in a way that shows you want to understand her, and you don't invalidate her (or even her change of mind)... that might lead to, if not a clean resolution, a better dynamic and healthier relationship between you going forward... even if she sticks to her current stance, and you still stand your ground (since you can, as they need you).", "NAH. We often think one way before having kids, and another way after we've had them, as it's a profoundly changing event. I also don't think you'd be a laughingstock if you did change your mind. However, I don't think this is a question reddit can help solve, as it is deeply personal and has implications for your extended family. \n\nMaybe think about if you plan to raise your children in the religion or not. If the answer is yes, I'd lean more towards doing the ceremony and reminding yourself that it's usually people who give religion a bad name, not the religion itself.  If the answer is no, then maybe some more quiet discussion with your wife about the decision before the two of you face the grandparents. You could take the lead with the grandparents and make it clear it's your decision, so your wife isn't stuck in the middle. \n\nGood luck in making this important decision.", "Ask your wife who she would prefer to make happy. You or her parents.\nNTA", "I'm so curious as to what the ceremony is", "Nta\nThey are cultists indoctrinating your child\n\nProtect the children from religion", "And this is why I tell my children that a hat in the hand takes you far further in life the a steel rod for a spine.\n\nI don't think I've ever known anyone who made an \"I've seen the light and am now better than you\" speech and not ended up deeply humiliated over it later. It's actually hilarious, you made a big deal to everyone about your (excuse the phrase) 'come to Jesus' moment and then at the first test your wife jumps off the bandwagon. Ppl are already laughing at you, this is always hilarious.\n\nThe takeout from this is that being humble is free, being arrogant is an all access pass to humiliation. \n\nFYI I'm not religious and I wouldn't do the ceremony either. However, I also don't make a big deal about it - unlike you who read a sermon to your whole family while claiming to have seen the light.", "NTA. You've already made your decision, and you can live with it.", "NTA. You participated in the making if the child. This means you get a say in the child's religious affiliation, ceremonies, and upbringing. In certain situations, if the parents don't agree, nothing should happen. This is one of those situations. Other people's opinions don't matter. You can listen to them but let it go in one ear and out the other. No stopping in the middle.\n\nThanks for doing your best to forge a new path for your son.", "Sounds like you have the upper hand if the ceremony has to be done by you. Just refuse to do it \n\nNTA", "NTA - use their mindset against them. As the man and head of the family, you are saying no.", "NTA all religion is bs", "INFO: Does this ceremony allow your child to assimilate into the mainstream of your culture (where you live) in a way that not having it would be a detriment to your child? \n\nI say this as I'm not sure the majority of people on this sub are going to know the details of what's involved in the ceremony (or the implications within your culture), and there may be reasons why your wife is willing to buy in to this for the benefit of her child, even if she doesn't believe it's right. It's worth a deeper discussion with your wife, IMO.", "NTA. Avoid indoctrinating your child from the start. Let them make up their mind when they are old enough.", "Look, I'm someone who believes that if a man is quoting a patriarchy part of their religion then you've found the problem with the marriage- but I think in this case you should do it, and tell your inlaws off for interfering in your marriage. I'm sure there's a way to get around you objecting to the ceremony, but they can figure it out. I'd make sure the church they're using knows you're the father and you don't have the sane beliefs though, no need to make their loophole search easy. \n\nI think people can always change, so the hypocrisy after your ranting isn't relevant,  but neither you nor your wife should be making major decisions like this without your spouse, and someone needs to tell the inlaws that. If they don't want you doing it they shouldn't push patriarchal views. \nNTA", "NTA you have every right to disagree with this and tbh so would I. I think as well I would be concerned as your son gets older they start influencing his decisions in regards to their wants and beliefs", "I know this is not a forum for nuance but let me try in any event. \n\nI agree that religion should be choice and not forced on anybody.  So, I agree in principle with you that this should be your choice, but you do have a conundrum here in that your wife no longer agrees with you or rather she want to try and keep the peace with her parents. You are not married to her parents, but you are to her. You have one of 2 options you can stand your ground but lose the war, meaning your partner or you can lose the battle (your pride).\n\nLife is not always as binary as some people think. Sometimes you have to forgo certain things for the greater good.  Marriage is complicated on a good day, and you are going to have to face these types of situations on a regular basis.  \n\nIf I were you, I would let my wife get her way this time.  Do the stupid ceremony and get on with your life. It's one day and hopefully they will leave you alone after that.  I know people are going to say if you give them an inch then they will keep on doing it but that is a chance you will have to take unless you are able to convince your wife. \n\nNTA but you have to choose your battles wisely. This has the potential to bite you in the ass. \n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA. How weird is it that your wife wants to bully you into being in charge.", "NTA\n\nKinda sounds like you hold all the cards", "NTA  Sit your wife down and tell her to convince you but she isn't allowed to use that family wants it or to keep peace in the family. She must convince you on the merits of the ceremony alone. Doubt she will be able to and may end up realizing herself that it isn't what she wants for child. You can also tell her why it isn't good idea.", "Uhhhh is this about a mundana \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: if it is, I totally sympathize. Kind of in a similar position here, not regarding this particular ceremony but several. I have no religious bone in my body and husband isn't religious either but we often have to participate in all kinds of ceremonies because of in-laws. It's hard being atheist/agnostic in South Asia unlike the west where you can be open about it. All the best to you though, I wish I had the courage to openly rebel as well.", "NTA \n\nAll religion is stupid. Orthodoxy doubly so.", "It\u2019s also good to draw this line in the sand with the ILs *now* because they will see that they can pressure OP into doing their bidding otherwise.", "Agreed.  And the fact that OP's wife literally agreed on a plan a year ago equates to a pretty big bait and switch.  She needs to stop being such a doormat and stand up for what she agreed to do in the first place.  NTA", "He was baby trapped into a religion. That is evil on wife's part. He never got the chance to walk away knowing what he knows now. Tell her no more kids because you can't trust your wife. NTA", "Well, thanks for the opinion. I never said to anyone that I've seen the light or \"come to Jesus\" moment. Have grown up with the religion and caste mindset. Seen family look down on others based on this. Am not preaching anyone in my family to do anything. Rather, I am asking them not to expect me to follow what I do not believe in. And that is how I put my points why I do not want my son to have the ceremony. However, it is a matter of emotions and what the society thinks for them. 'How should I answer when people ask if the ceremony is not being held for my grandson' is the only strong point they have. The ceremony is not for my son or for my wife or myself. It is to appease the society that they are conformal.\n\nNevertheless, I see your point of being humble. Good day to you!", "I think I'd agree if it were *just* the in-laws who wanted it, but it sounds like OP's parents also want it done. It sounds like it is a common practice in OP's culture, and he's the only one \"going against the grain\".\n\nNot to say that he's the AH for not wanting it done, but I don't think this is just a matter of in-laws wanting it for the sake of getting their own way."]}
