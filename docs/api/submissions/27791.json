While my wife was pregnant and during the first few months after birth, she agreed with me. Later, my in-laws visited us, and she visited them a few times and suddenly she changed her decision and now wants to have this ceremony. Or rather, she wants to do it for her parents. I am against this, because it celebrates the orthodox hierarchy system and all the hypocrisy it comes with it.\n\nA year or so back, my wife agreed to it as I wanted my son to be out of this age-old orthodox mindset and to be better than that. I lengthily spoke to all my family members about why I want to opt out and why I have another opinion and that I want my son to grow in a different and a better way. Now, if I do it (because of their pressure), I will be a laughing stock as my words mean nothing and it would just be seen as an immature rant.\n\nAdditionally, this ceremony must be done by the father as the mother has no rights (a patriarchal mindset). So, I am in a way, just the last piece in the puzzle. It was also shocking to hear that my wife is ok with the patriarchal mindset for this ceremony because it makes her parents happy.To summarize, I am the only one not happy about it and everyone is angry at me for making a big fuss about it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 1: We are a Hindu family and my parents and in-laws are of Brahmin caste. The ceremony is harmless but if I do it, there will be many more to follow with similar arguments.\n\nEdit 2: I even offered that I will be out of it and that my wife can do it in my stead. But no, the religion does not allow women to do it. Only the father should. And that is one of the many view I completely reject.\n\n**Edit 3: Thank you all for your support and honest opinions. I really appreciate it. In a way, sharing it here did help me.

I know that's not the only reason at all, but it does sound like a large part of why you don't want to change your mind (aside from your other more valid - given your world-views - perspective) is because you don't want to lose face.  And that, ironically, sounds immature.\n\nYour other reasons are fair, especially as it's you that has to do it despite being most against it, and given your wife seemed to be on board with you previously.  \n\nFor the well-being of your relationship with your wife (no matter the final outcome) - it is worth checking in with her whether she really was on board with you back then, or was actually uncertain or felt pressured by (or was indifferent and so differed to) your strong  opinion. \n\nOr, has she now actually changed her mind (or firmed up what she was unsure of before) in terms of what she actually thinks about the ceremony and what it means (she is allowed to, by the way... not that this makes th situation easier... but she is... we all are allowed to change our minds, though we have to weigh that against what was previously agreed)... or is she just caving in because she wants to keep family happy, but doesn't actually care (it's symbolism holds no power to her)?  In which case maybe thinking she can convince you that it's just for show, no big deal... and thus keep all parties happy (on balance, if she can bring you round to this view).  \n\nIf you can have the conversation in a way that shows you want to understand her, and you don't invalidate her (or even her change of mind)... that might lead to, if not a clean resolution, a better dynamic and healthier relationship between you going forward... even if she sticks to her current stance, and you still stand your ground (since you can, as they need you).", "NAH. We often think one way before having kids, and another way after we've had them, as it's a profoundly changing event. I also don't think you'd be a laughingstock if you did change your mind. However, I don't think this is a question reddit can help solve, as it is deeply personal and has implications for your extended family. \n\nMaybe think about if you plan to raise your children in the religion or not. If the answer is yes, I'd lean more towards doing the ceremony and reminding yourself that it's usually people who give religion a bad name, not the religion itself.  If the answer is no, then maybe some more quiet discussion with your wife about the decision before the two of you face the grandparents. You could take the lead with the grandparents and make it clear it's your decision, so your wife isn't stuck in the middle. \n\nGood luck in making this important decision.", "Ask your wife who she would prefer to make happy.

It's actually hilarious, you made a big deal to everyone about your (excuse the phrase) 'come to Jesus' moment and then at the first test your wife jumps off the bandwagon.

I'd make sure the church they're using knows you're the father and you don't have the sane beliefs though, no need to make their loophole search easy. \n\nI think people can always change, so the hypocrisy after your ranting isn't relevant,  but neither you nor your wife should be making major decisions like this without your spouse, and someone needs to tell the inlaws that.

Do the stupid ceremony and get on with your life. It's one day and hopefully they will leave you alone after that.

My mom comes from a Catholic family. By her late teens, she was well on her way to being a lapsed/cafeteria Catholic. When I was born she resisted getting me baptized, but eventually caved to my grandparents' and extended family's pressure. \n\nShe has always regretted it, because when I reached the age when it would usually be time to start thinking about my first communion, she had some very bitter fights with that side of my family. I had no interest in it, but the whole thing was pretty confusing for me. She believes it would have been easier for me and her if she had set the precedent from the start. \n\nIt was made clear as I was growing up that religious belief was a deeply personal decision, and if I had an interest, that was fine. The decision was always mine. \n\nI honestly believe that it was one of the best things that my mother ever did for me, and it's something that I still respect her for.", "OP,just my guess but is it janeu or a ceremony similar to it (the sacred thread one),mundaan or some other Hindu ceremony? Your description gives me those vibes lol\n\nPersonally I think you need to reason with your wife because she was amenable to your views earlier so she might turn around. Has she become religious all of a sudden? Ask her why she wants it,for the actual religious significance of the ceremony or as an occasion for her family to get together or something? Remind her of just why you wanted to opt out of it (you might even find some articles or other stuff online to add to your argument).\n\n I don't think you or anyone opting out of religion is an a-hole so NTA of course. I'm agnostic myself and have told my parents and a couple of direct relatives,response was mixed but my parents took it decently and didn't  oppose it but they do ask me to do a few religious things sometimes with them or follow some dictates and I often relent because they need the reassurance but not with things that seriously go against my moral code.I know I'm lucky for not getting hounded about it so it's easier for me to say it but if it's something that you think is harmful then staying polite but firm is the way to go imo", "NTA, use their patriarchy against them. Say that as the father and husband you have decided not to do the ceremony and are putting your foot down on this and that is that!

I understand why, a sacrifice and all that to join the covenant, but man, this really does exclude women, to the point there have been arguments of whether they are part of the covenant. \n\nWhen your in-laws say what will people say? Tell them you can\u2019t make decisions based on a community you aren\u2019t a part of. And if your son feels slighted, he can have the Bris later on in his life. I like the naming ceremonies better anyway. No blood and women are allowed. Your wife likely didn\u2019t realize how much her parents\u2019 being angry would be upsetting. We don\u2019t always know when we go against them on something big how the dominos will fall. \n\nI think you and wife need to see a couple\u2019s therapist. And maybe you need to go see a more progressive rabbi to get this anger and frustration more out in the open. There are open orthodox and modern orthodox that are egalitarian, so they likely allow mothers to be there now, and there have been orthodox women\u2019s rabbis (well women got simcha).

If it's just some benign ritual like baptismal rite or something like that then I don't see too much harm in letting the grandfather do it if they really really want it. No one can force you to participate. Doing some silly rituals with a child who won't even remember it makes no real difference. The way you raise your child and the values you instill as a parent -- that's what important. Of course, this doesn't apply to rituals inflicting permanent harm on the child like circumcision. Ideally this should not be done at all until the child grows and decided to do it consciously, but at least should be a mutual decision by parents.", "INFO: Is it a brit milah?

People will literally dress their kids in cute traditional outfits. Annaprasana is done for all Hindu kids not just Brahmins. Upanayanam is done for only Brahmins and boys. and it is a very important ceremony. This ceremony is done to CELEBRATE THE BABY. This is the first solid food you feed your baby which is a very important milestone. it is done so that the baby will have a healthy life, education, and prosperity. That's why the father will make the baby write the baby's name in rice. For upanayanam, will get a haircut, ear piercing, and a sacred thread. ( both haircut and piercing are optional my brother when he was 15 got both done out of his free will but my cousin who is also 15 said no to both and just stuck with sacred thread. No one objected or said anything). This ceremony is a very important identity as a Brahmin. \n\nBoth ceremonies are done in temples or a function hall where you can feed HOMELESS people with more than 7 varieties of food. Relatives will gift your son literally gold, money, and new clothes while you will also gift them only clothes and feed them for lunch. My nephew's annaprasana was done a month ago and relatives gifted him 5 rings, a chain, bracelet - all gold and so much money that my cousin is putting in a bank account so that he can use it in the future as he wishes. Most important all his cousins will get this function so your son will be the only one who will not get this ceremony. That's one way to give him an identity crisis. \n\nAlso if I listen to this they will make me do other NO. There are only 3 ceremonies you will do for Brahmin boys annaprasana, upanayanam, and marriage.

This ceremony gives a chance for you to feed homeless people, and for others to bless and shower your son with gifts. You can use it as a get-together and even make it a fun relatives day out like my cousin did. We all had so much fun mingling with each other and playing games in the function hall with good food. You can have a very intimate ceremony which lasts for 2 hours and just chill with your relatives for the rest of the time. What problem do you even have with this ceremony and why don't you mention the name of the ceremony? So that people will google and get to know that it is not patriarchal or controversial at all? That it's just a get-together with relatives to have fun?? \n\nYTA. I am not a fan of our community either. I know how they rip people apart.

You also said that your parents did not perform the ceremony for you, which is perfectly ok. It is a matter of their belief system. Now, I have a question for you. Did you have a civil ceremony or a religious ceremony? If you had a religious ceremony, then your wife and her family probably did not have an inkling that you are an atheist. Would that have figured into their decision making as far as match? I would have to say yes from your post and comments.

From your vehemence and comments to the effect that if she wants this she can go out there and do it on her own implies a rigidity. She may want to have the celebration and maybe using her parents as a buffer because of your vehement attitude. Marriages require love, understanding and a little give and take.   \nAs regards the allegations about excluding women, I think you have grown up without much knowledge about Hinduism, which was true for me. All ceremonies require both husbands and wives to join in. A father cannot give away a daughter without the mother standing beside him participating in the rituals and practices. If you are a widower, another family member with a wife will perform the ceremony. This is because there is a belief in the need for both masculine and feminine energy for a blessing. As far as I know (and I have studied other religions), Hinduism (maybe along with Buddhism which came after) is the only religion that assigns power to the woman as Shakthi. \n\nToday, women can perform rites in consultation with the priest.  I am proud to say my nephew had such a wedding. His wife\u2019s parents were divorced and the father was not involved in her life.

The caste system does not help anyone and I agree you should not lower yourself to performative displays that mean nothing except to reinforce toxic beliefs.", "NTA\n\nGood that you hold the power. Refuse to do the ceremony and tell your family that still believe in the caste system crap that they need to leave you and your family out of that garbage mindset.", "ESH.  Maybe try raising a new generation that is not beholden to the ridiculous superstitions of generations past.", "Both parents are involved in the ceremony though the father is the one saying the mantras. I am more familiar and say the mantras more often than the men in my family. It is not patriarchal. This is more an interpretation of the poster and it is probably because his parents were disinterested and he is an atheist. Sadly, my parents did not have any discussions about the meaning of the culture and ceremonies with me. Due to serendipity, I did courses on Indian Philosophy and as an adult explored the faith and was surprised by the empathy and inclusivity in the teachings. The negative interpretations and exaggerations have come from colonialists which is embedded in English language based literature and education.", "It was for an orthodox ceremony though.", "ITS HIS CHILD HE CHOOSES WHAT HE WANTS FOR HIM/HER.", "From him saying that she changed her mind, most likely he expressed that.", "But it is his choice, if he isn't accepting take it like he wants it, it's because it is his choice. If roles were reversed wouldn't you want the wife to abuse her matriarchal rights in that?", "Why would violating the stated boundaries of OP be any less disrespectful if it was Christian lol", "The issue of religious coercion is definitely a concern on its own", "Seriously this excuse is so intellectually dishonest!", "sure. but I was raised hindu and other hindus on this thread have also commented that for the ceremony he\u2019s referring to, it\u2019s not true that fathers are the only ones who can do it. mothers can participate as well or a priest. so it sounds like he\u2019s using the \u201cpatriarchal\u201d thing as an excuse when it\u2019s not even true.", "OP is not Christian", "Hell, they *created* those buttons.", "My only point is that if OP wanted to appease in-laws he could just go with it cause his argumentation about patriarchy and ideology isn't relevant here. What's relevant is how he will raise the child and what he will teach the child. But OP also made a good point about caving once for the pushy in-laws which will open the flood of more pressure and I agree that in this case it's better to stand his ground.", "Nice work!!", "Why should *anyone* be put through a religious rite or ceremony when they can\u2019t personally consent? When they won\u2019t remember\u2026. Who is it for, then? The parents? That\u2019s not respecting the baby\u2019s autonomy, it\u2019s steamrolling it for the sake of the parents\u2019 views. It\u2019s never been about honoring the baby. Would you see an issue with a comatose adult being baptized (or similar) without their consent?", "Oh I agree completely! If he does this then every time something comes up they're going to be like well you changed your mind for that you can change your mind for this too... That was misleading you shouldn't have done that so now you have to do all the ceremonies! Blah blah blah. Lol", "Be strong!! It ain\u2019t easy!! I\u2019ve done it, lots of my extended family still doesn\u2019t approve.", "I'm glad you reject it. The caste system has zero positive to it except for keeping the top at the top.", "Because we do plenty of stuff to babies without their consent. The ones that have literally zero consequence aren't the ones to worry about.", "Maybe if people like you didn\u2019t treat trans people so poorly, they wouldn\u2019t be suicidal at all.", "My understanding from the post is that OP\u2019s objection is partly about the patriarchy but mainly about choosing to refuse to participate in the caste system. \n\nMy thought is: OP there is no power higher than your own conscience. If people laugh at you for changing your mind about this, whatever. But if you have to get up each day knowing that you compromised your integrity, well that\u2019s the kind of thing that leads nowhere good. \n\nI would have a chat with your wife and ask her whether she really thinks that pleasing her parents is worth your integrity.", "I do all this also, as a part of \"popculture\". But I didn't christened my children, we don't attend the church, I had only a corthouse wedding with my first husband (no wedding at all with my present SO) however the pressure from my catholic family was enormous.   \nAnd I would advice OP do the same - stay strong with your boundaries. Family eventually will stop nagging you.", "Maybe it depends on the country, I dunno, but I have never heard of this.", "Mayo white atheist here. I was baptised Church if England, my husband was baptised Catholic. Neither of our children are baptised because we are both atheist. I can't speak to the caste system but I can definitely speak to the pressures of the religious on those of no religion. There viewpoint was why could it matter to me when I didn't have a religion. They also hinted that they would do it on the sly. I told them if that was done I'd be forced to go to every other religion I could think of and have equivalent ceremonies performed. I was prepared and had just enough detail to scare them out of it.\n\nI have however, always made it clear to my children that their path is their own to choose and that, if they chose to offer themselves up to an organised religion, I'd support them.\n\nThud far, we are all still dreadful heathens.", "Okay real quick. Sometimes forcing children to participate in stuff that you disagree with is the only way to protect them. \n\nThink of a gay kid in a super homophobic area. A parent might force them to look/act straight in order to protect them from being killed. \n\nExamples of people killed in the USa for being gay\n\n[own parents did it](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/mom-pleads-guilty-murder-8-year-old-boy-thought-be-n848741)\n\n[adult but still young](https://abcnews.go.com/US/year-blaze-bernsteins-killing-parents-turn-alleged-hate/story?id=59754707)\n\nThink of an atheist parent in a Islamic country who has to force their daughter to be completely covered up in order to protect her from random people who would hurt her.\n\n[literally just wearing their cover wrong](https://www.newarab.com/news/iran-cops-beat-woman-death-not-having-proper-hijab)"]}
