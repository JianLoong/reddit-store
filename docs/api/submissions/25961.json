At 2 PM, I am sleeping if I have to start work at midnight.  And I get that you couldn't sleep, but she shouldn't be contacting you during your scheduled sleep time.  Turn your phone notification notices off when it's your sleep time and have a sit down discussion with her about what night shift life  means.\n\nYou might not be compatible.", "NTA.\n\nNot on insurance, only dating 1 month, working nights, don't live together.\n\nSure, your response could have been better. But also so could hers, there could have been more understanding of the timing.\n\nWhy didn't she take a cab or Uber? What's wrong with taking the bus anyway?", "NTA\n\nIt was OK of her to ask, but not to be upset about it. She is making some pretty strong demands after only a month of dating. Red flag.", "NTA no other words needed.", "NTA.  She is an adult and can plan her transportation.  She can get an uber if the city bus didn\u2019t work for her.  You\u2019ve only been dating for a month!  Why would you be adding this person to your insurance?!   Also what did she do for transportation before you?  This all seems odd to me.", "NTA, I think your point is valid also I don't see a problem in using the city bus I guess it really depends on where you live so it might be i dont know but yea NTA", "Who died and made you your GF, (of one month), her chauffeur ? She and her daughter got to the appointment. \n\nPersonally I would rather date somebody that can handle their own business without bothering me. Except in an emergency-which this was not. NTA", "Nta.", "NTA. Unless it\u2019s a last minute emergency appointment, your girlfriend had ample time to organise transport. You need to sleep.", "NTA. Last minute requests need not be honored, and besides, your reasoning for not driving them was in their best interest. Sounds like you and she need to have a conversation about what kind of favors you'll do and under what conditions.", "NTA.  And red flag that\u2019s she\u2019s that upset because you said no.", "NTA.  It wasn't an emergency, and you need sleep.", "NTA. You were being responsible. It\u2019s a good idea not to drive if you\u2019ve been working that late and not gotten any sleep. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. 1 month is too early on for her to be this pissed with you. Also, should you not exist in her life, how would she do it?", "NTA - I agree with the others who said you could have been a little more tactful, but meh...  3rd shift sux for anything during daylight.  Besides, what did she do before you for doc appts?", "NTA\n\nYou've only been dating a month. She has no right to be angry. You gave a very valid reason for saying no. Fact is, she did wait until the last minute to ask. I hate using the term \"red flag\", but this really is one. She's pissed because her brand new relationship didn't drop everything at the last minute to give them a ride somewhere when they had means to get there on their own.... She's an ah.", "NTA.\nYour reasons sound reasonable.", "NTA. She needs to be an adult and get her own source of transportation.

You\u2019ve only been dating a month and you\u2019re not responsible for her not having a car.  I mean, you could\u2019ve ordered her an Uber if she\u2019s short on money, but that\u2019s entirely up to you.", "NTA. As someone who works from 12am-8am it\u2019s one thing if you know in advance but to ask the day of two hours prior to the appointment is a no. It\u2019s very obvious your GF doesn\u2019t understand third shift sleep schedules are way different than the other shifts. She also doesn\u2019t understand that because you hadn\u2019t slept the likelihood of being in an accident increases, putting not only you, her and her daughter in danger, but others as well. \n\nAs long as I\u2019m given plenty of warning I\u2019m able to adjust my sleep schedule to accommodate my mother if she needs me to take her somewhere. For example Saturday she wants to go to the farmers market. Which means instead of sleeping from 10 to 1-3pm like normal. I\u2019ll probably be awake until 4/5 pm if not the time I normally go to bed 8/9pm. \n\nIf she had asked you 1-2 days prior your answer would\u2019ve probably been different, but since she asked you 2 hours prior she needs to respect your answer of no.", "NTA reconsider everything. i mean i get the stress of  going to the doctor with the kid, but whats wrong with the city bus? where that entitlement comes from ? she should have taken an uber or taxi or what in that area if she s that against it.\n\nYou did the responsable  safe thing.\n\nTo me it s a huge red flag, one month in a relationship make a tantrum like that!", "Lol dating a month and this argument pops up. You won\u2019t be dating her for long if she continues to be fragile and entitled. She should get her own car if she is so against taking a city bus.", "Yup. I worked nights for a long time and people don't get it. If she doesn't respect it this early it's a red flag.", "I was already fooling with my phone because I couldn\u2019t sleep but I will keep that in mind.", "also already introducing her child to a boyfriend of 1 month.", "Nothing wrong with taking the bus. She should have planned it better. She probably thought 100% for sure I would take her.", "Yeah she can ask but she should take no for a answer.", "I didn\u2019t say I will be adding her to my insurance. I was saying I won\u2019t let her drive my car because she\u2019s not on my insurance.", "I don't think she thinks things through clearly. Another time she wanted me to drive her to see her friend 4 and half hours away and 4 and a half hours back all in the same day. I said no because I have 3 dogs at home. She was furious.", "I\u2019m getting downvoting in \nMy comments on this sub. She must on Reddit. Lol", "Thank you", "LoL wut?  It's been a month - the only uber he'd be in any way appropriate paying for would be rides to and from his place.", "I was so exhausted and sleep deprived like I was going to pass out, no I didn\u2019t. I should of though.", "Cold????....... OP stated that they couldn't give a ride cause they needed to sleep for work and didn't want to risk getting into an accident and injuring his gf or her child... how tf is that \"cold\"?", "Honestly, I\u2019m not making fun of her but I think she could be kind of slow. She also wanted me to take her to see her friends 4 and a half always away, hang out there for a couple of hours, and come back and drive for another 4 and a half hours all in one say. I said no because I couldn't leave my dogs alone that long. She couldn't understand why I wouldn't do it. She said it in her own words she's tired of putting all the effort into her relationships. Lol", "Yeah, huge red flag", "Fair enough.  But for dating for just a month, she is expecting a lot from you.  Again she is an adult and mother\u2026responsible for her family.  You are just getting to know each other.  This seems very rushed to me.  Not asking for a ride but putting onus on you and the anger.  Good luck!", "NTA. But, this is a taste of your future with her.", "all I can say is yikes.. run.", "NTA buy you need to cut ties with this woman. Shes making a lot of demands on your time and resources very early in the relationship. She gets mad whrn you dobt do as she commands.", "Yeah. It really does sound like it's time to talk about the limits to what kind of favors you can do for her or are willing to do for her.", "Should have said no because that\u2019s bonkers. You might want to cut her loose.", "Fair, but it would have been the \"nice\" thing to do.", "Fair enough. Sets a weird precedence this early on too.", "No you shouldn't. Not only is it unsafe, it's way too early in a relationship for a person to be dropping everything at the last second to do someone a favor that wasn't mature enough to ensure they had a ride.", "I honestly don't know, I may have read it in a harsh tone. Going to delete so my inbox doesn't full up.", "She wanted you to leave your dogs for over half a day if not longer\u2026. And she thinks she\u2019s the one putting all the effort into the relationship?", "Thanks. I wouldn't mind giving her a ride if I had more of a notice and more sleep", "I did say no.", "Yes, one would think she would have planned this out. I think she just assumed I would say yes.", "Yes, I know. I would be gone for over 12 hours. That's a full day", "You shouldn\u2019t even be meeting her child this early. Why are you dating this woman? You see what\u2019s up, right? She\u2019s going to use the hell out of you,", "Yes"]}
