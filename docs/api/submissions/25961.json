I\u2019ll probably be awake until 4/5 pm if not the time I normally go to bed 8/9pm. \n\nIf she had asked you 1-2 days prior your answer would\u2019ve probably been different, but since she asked you 2 hours prior she needs to respect your answer of no.", "NTA reconsider everything. i mean i get the stress of  going to the doctor with the kid, but whats wrong with the city bus? where that entitlement comes from ? she should have taken an uber or taxi or what in that area if she s that against it.\n\nYou did the responsable  safe thing.\n\nTo me it s a huge red flag, one month in a relationship make a tantrum like that!", "Lol dating a month and this argument pops up.

But, this is a taste of your future with her.", "all I can say is yikes.. run.", "NTA buy you need to cut ties with this woman.

Also you were right she should have told you if she knew she needed a ride. I really doubt she made the appointment at 3:30 that same day.

Even doing the bare minimum of scrolling somewhere else up until bedtime and then putting the phone down can make a difference (vs reducing all blue light for 30-60min before bed which is ultra good sleep hygiene). The only time I scroll in bed is in the AM to wake up but never in the evening.

That's alot to take on in one day. 9 hrs plus traffic and she expected you to just leave your dogs at home for that long.  \n\nEven if you didn't have dogs to take care off. 9 hours is still a long trip for anyone to take on. If she wants to visit her friend then she can do that on her own. No one is stopping her.", "Phones emit blue light which causes your brain to produce less of a chemical that makes you sleepy.

Stop being so trusting of people.", "Honestly, I\u2019d introduce them early on just because one, if you\u2019re dating someone with children, you should know and they shouldn\u2019t be hidden away as if they don\u2019t exist. And two, if things progress and you go to their house or something, it\u2019s always best if the kids know you first and aren\u2019t going to see you as a stranger coming in and being close with their parent suddenly. But it should be like introducing a friend(with honesty of course, not lying and saying you\u2019re just friends), not like introducing a new parental figure. It needs to be up to everyone involved to decide whether or not they\u2019ll be a parental figure, although if there is clearly zero interest, that\u2019s a red flag. But then so is expecting someone you barely have a relationship with to suddenly be a coparent with you.", "I replied this to someone much deeper in the chain but while your advice is right it's not blue light that's the problem specifically.\n\nIt turns out, the main study about it compared an iPad to a book and then blamed blue light when the iPad user took an extra 10 minutes to get to sleep. 10 minutes! And they didn't check blue against reduced blue, they checked ipad (self lit) against book (not self lit) but blamed blue light anyway!\n\nExcellent summary here: https://time.com/5752454/blue-light-sleep/\n\nTLDR: not blue light, it's staring into a light source that's the issue. And it's not as big of an issue as is often claimed.", "Stop living. Stay inside. Don't let anybody in.", "this is a really extreme take and i hope you realise that. \n\nyeah these things happen, but there\u2019s a huge middle ground that youre ignoring. nobody is suggesting leaving the kid alone with the new partner or adding them to the pick up list at school, but kids dont have to be hidden away for months or years just because someone might be a psychopath. its way more likely to be a family member, a close neighbour or another longstanding close relationship than a new partner thats only been around for a short period of time", "This.

Thank you for this comment", "I see, that makes sense", "NTA\n\nYou've only been dating one month, and she's already demanding rides? If she's asking to try her luck, that's fine, but emotional blackmail when she gets a no for an answer is very rude!\n\nMy husband's car broke down half a year ago. He takes an uber or bus unless I offer to give him a ride. Sometimes, he would even decline my offer because he didn't want to take up my time.\n\nSay you haven't started dating yet. Your gf and her daughter would have taken the bus or uber if you weren't in the picture anyway! Why is she talking like it's the end of the world and guilt tripping you!", "NTA my BF of 20 years works nights I would not dream of asking him to do something in the day , and youve only been together a month very entitled behaviour", "NTA\nSounds like you made a good judgement call for everybodys safety.", "NTA. Dump her. What an entitled AH.", "NTA - What is the problem with taking the bus ?", "Why is she asking you to do anything when you're supposed to be sleeping?

What would she have done one month prior when you haven\u00b4t been in the picture yet? Her daughters doctors appointments are not your responsibility, esp. after 1 MONTH.\n\nNTA.", "Right? When the appt was made were they even together? What did she plan on doing in that case? Her disregard for his health and safety as well as her and her kid\u2019s (bc no sleep isn\u2019t a recipe for safe driving) is not acceptable, and then he has to spend time he should be asleep at an appointment for his girlfriend of one month\u2019s? No thanks.

I work the same hours now at the same company but only on weekends now, almost 6 months.", "If this was a long term relationship where you lived together and it was your kid it would be different. But after a month?? I would never have the hubris to ask that much of someone that earlier in a relationship. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t want \u201cmy better half\u201d kind of partner, she wants a \u201cmake my life easier\u201d kind of partner. Run.", "OP, you already know this but just adding it again: you\u2019re NTA in any way, shape, or form. This appt was certainly scheduled prior to you all dating, especially it being a standard check up, and she still scheduled it because of course life existed and she could function before. Her teen daughter and her can stand to take the bus or Uber or any other number of options; expecting you to come and wait around for her daughter\u2019s appointment is inappropriate even if you didn\u2019t have an odd schedule. Also, everyone saying maybe she doesn\u2019t understand night shift is silly, if you say you haven\u2019t had sleep and you need it, that\u2019s enough. You\u2019ve said yourself you deserve better and to that point, she doesn\u2019t deserve you. Her audacity and entitlement is mind boggling. Surely no facet of this relationship can be redeeming enough for you to be used by her, and when you don\u2019t allow that (yay! Good for you- example not only this but the trip thing) to get any upset reaction is just immature and disrespectful. I do wonder how often she asks for rides or for you to pay for things, and when you do drive her does she ever offer payment for things like fuel?", "Or worse, this is her at her best and it\u2019ll only go further and further downhill. Totally agree, OP doesn\u2019t seem that enthusiastic about her in his comments, and for good reason, he should let her know the bus will be her transportation more permanently until she finds another guy with a car to date, she should look into ones that don\u2019t care about insurance so she can bum his car \ud83d\ude02 Her demands just from the post and the few comments I\u2019ve gotten through are beyond entitled, I don\u2019t think we have heard a redeeming quality yet haha", "I use my phone too when I can\u2019t sleep, it helps my mind quiet down, regardless, if I\u2019m supposed to be asleep I don\u2019t answer texts/messages to avoid staying awake plus it defeats the purpose of being on my phone while trying to fall back sleep.", ">I was on the phone because I couldn't sleep\n\nWhich only makes the issue worse. \n\n\nElectronics and harsh light when you can't sleep are absolutely to be avoided if you actually want to sleep.\n\n\nSure it's not as fun, but it's also not draining your ability to sleep via various stimuli", ">You never really know for sure if someone is going to try and touch your kid.

Most people who work day shift don't come home and knock out immediately and then wake up a bunch of hours before work. They go to work, they come home and do some stuff for several hours, and then knock out.
