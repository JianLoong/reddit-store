You said you sleep there when you visit. So chances are that his story is valid. He and the Ex have financially supported each other for a WHILE. It\u2019s an ebb and flow exchange. Someone he cares about is holding their dads hand while he dies. It not like grandma or whatever.

They might be \u201ctogether\u201d and they might not. But what is absolutely certain is they are nesting partners. They do love each other and neither wants to abandon the emotional bond they have even if it isn\u2019t necessarily romantic. Again they could be very romantic you don\u2019t really know. They have built a life together that they don\u2019t want to let go of. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that and even having an open relationship but you didn\u2019t sign up for that. You don\u2019t want to be his side girlfriend why she\u2019s the one he goes home too. You didn\u2019t sign up for that but that\u2019s where you\u2019re at.

If I wait it could go on for a long, long time.", "Exactly this.", "My normal advice is just leave, but you're not even with the guy so stay put and lose his number i guess.\n\nHe gave you a sob story about why he can't spend any more time, money or energy on you, but you can still drive down once or twice a month to service him.", "INFO:  How \"long distance\" are you?  You use the term \"partner\" but dating someone  long distance how much actual real life time have you spent actually together?  Have you met his ex, have you been to his house or met his friends and family?  How id the two of you meet?", "Don't waste your life on this loser.", "I think all of this is perfectly plausible.\n\nIt\u2019s likely he and his ex are still close and consider each other family. What that tells you is that he doesn\u2019t/can\u2019t turn off his feelings once romance is gone. That\u2019s a good sign.\n\nHe\u2019s not promising to help her indefinitely, just until her father dies. He may lose his patience for this situation, but he hasn\u2019t yet.\n\n(Don\u2019t forget that she might inherit some money the will enable her to buy out your bf. She might even do more since he\u2019s supporting her through this though time.)\n\nYou have choices:\n\n1. Walk away because you are uncomfortable with the uncertainty and lack of quality time.\n\n2. Propose that you open up your relationship to see others, since he\u2019s not able to invest in it. Not out of anger, but out of reality. (Warning: he may rightfully decide you\u2019re just looking for a warm body and don\u2019t see him as special. And given he\u2019s just out of a LTR, he may opt to let you go, if he\u2019s looking for something with legs.)\n\n3. Decide he\u2019s someone you want and wait it out. (You don\u2019t have to wait for ever, but you don\u2019t have to force his hand right away.)\n\nI see the way someone treats their ex is a sign of their character. Knowing nothing more about him, he sounds like a decent guy. \n\nI\u2019m not hearing that he\u2019s trying to win her back, he just has her back.\n\nThey were together for years. They don\u2019t hate each other. The worst thing to ever happen to her is happening in slow motion. My guess is that your bf cares about this man as well (another good sign). He\u2019s not abandoning them.\n\nSounds like a solid guy. He\u2019ll end up with someone.

Like any kind of plan or expectations?\n\nIMO people love to have a narrow minded view with relationships. Like as soon as someone is an \u201cex\u201d they should be dead to you. I find it ridiculous. There are a million ways to have a relationship with someone and nobody here has enough context to have absolute answers about this situation. \n\nI think it\u2019s reasonable to still be roommates. And \u201cjust selling the house\u201d might be a shitty move? Especially in this economy. It\u2019s also reasonable for them to still care about each other in a platonic way. So to counter some people who like to point to the worst case scenario, there\u2019s plenty of reasons why this could be totally fine. \n\nBut you probably should have a serious talk about what you both want for the future and they should probably be planning on how they are going to fully separate themselves.

People are getting more than their houses are worth...still. They could absolutely sell that house and split the profits and find apartments, which would also be overpriced but it would cut out their relationship completely. Plus they would make more of a profit than if they waited a few years and then sold the house, because by then the market will have normalized. The fact is anybody that says they're trying to get out of this sort of situation & not selling their house right now.... is probably not trying to get out of the situation.", "I know teachers work term time only but im sure their pay is split evenly over the year (in the UK) so i dont think summer funds will get tight, definitely sounds fishy as hell x", "WTF??

And if there is no end game at what point are you going to get sick of it? Personally I would be okay if they said something like we plan on selling the house next year.
