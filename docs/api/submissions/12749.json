Besides, I don't want to drive all the kids to school and then pick them up. My wife is upset and said I need to support her and talk to him. I think it's pointless. He's eighteen. If he doesn't want to call her mom, we can't really make him.\n\nMy wife says I am being a lazy asshole that just doesn't want to have a conversation with him. Maybe I am an asshole, but I did talk to him. He said he's not going to call her mom again, ever. Well, what am I supposed to do about it? Even if we find a way to force him to, he's going to school out of state, so what would we do then? Just seems like a pointless battle that will only create more animosity.
