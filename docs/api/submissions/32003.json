There are likely far better ways to bring it up than simply calling her a hypocrite.

She disagreed with you, and you could have stopped there, and simply agreed to disagree. But, you had to go and prove your point, be right, and go further to call her a hypocrite. THAT is where you are the AH. \n\nAs I said, there are different levels of cheating. A kiss is simply a kiss. A dance is nothing more than a dance. It can be emotionally cheating, but it can simply  be harmless flirting, too.

Did you see and verify the type, commitment to, and length of said kiss?\n\nNo, you weren't. Ergo, stop trying to gatekeep on another's behavior when you weren't there.

So right now your \"universal\" is 8/11 people or only 73%. We don't have a real sample, that's just 11 top comments in this thread, but that's my point. People differ. And claiming YOUR definition of cheating is universal without serious info to back that up is just as bullshit as me claiming my definition of cheating is universal.", "> stop trying to gatekeep on another's behavior when you weren't there\n\nStop trying to defend cheating. \n\nYes because people in a nightclub are really going to kiss in replacement of a handshake, do you often make excuses for cheaters?", ">When your friend cheated, did he kiss someone or did he fuck someone?\n\nHe had sex with someone but again the vast majority of people agree kissing is cheating.
