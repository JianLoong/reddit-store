He always has. It\u2019s gotten him into trouble quite a few times.\n\nA little over a year ago, he met June (23). She was 12 weeks pregnant at the time, father no way in sight. Peter and June moved really fast. She was living with him just 4 months later. He told me that he was going to help her with the baby which I was on the fence about as they had just met but also figured it\u2019s not my business and it\u2019s honorable of him to want to help his girlfriend with her baby. \n\nJune had a baby girl, Cadence, 6 months ago. Peter has been heavily involved in her life. Recently, he proposed to June.\n\nWe went to their place to celebrate the big news. That\u2019s when my wife asked if Peter had plans to adopt Cadence. June and Peter avoided the subject and my wife let it drop, figuring it may be tricky, especially if Cadence\u2019s bio dad didn\u2019t want to relinquish rights. \n\nLater on, after Cadence was put to bed, June and Peter admitted that he wouldn\u2019t have to adopt Cadence as he\u2019s on the birth certificate. I asked wasn\u2019t that fraud. He said after speaking to a lawyer, even if it made it to court, there\u2019s no legal repercussions. Their reasoning for doing this is Peter will have equal say in Cadence\u2019s life. If for whatever reason they broke up, he\u2019d get custody. I instantly thought \u201cand he\u2019d be on the hook for child support\u201d. But I stayed quiet.\n\nMy wife asked if they planned on telling Cadence the truth and they said yes, it won\u2019t be a secret. The bio dad is also aware and doesn\u2019t care as he has no desire to be a dad.\n\nI don\u2019t think that June is trying to get money out of him. She actually comes from a wealthier family and works for her dad\u2019s company. I genuinely believe they just love each other but to me, this is a recipe for disaster. \n\nI tried to let it go. Then, Peter stopped by the house for something and we got to talking about Cadence. Peter called her \u201chis daughter\u201d and I said I\u2019m glad he loves her, but him signing the birth certificate was a huge mistake. I pointed out all the things that could go wrong. He said he doesn\u2019t care and wants to do right by \u201chis girls\u201d. He called me unsupportive and told me to either get on board or I won\u2019t get to be in my granddaughter\u2019s life.\n\nI love my granddaughter, blood doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s family.

Additionally, it doesn't make him an asshole to say, \"I've already thought about this a lot and don't share your concerns.\"\n\nBut now that you've said your piece and he's heard you, you need to drop it. You will be the asshole if you don't get on board. Your son is an adult, he's made an adult decision.

It will only drive a wedge between you and him.", "I think what your son did was an incredibly noble move. Far too many individuals out there will turn tail and run from a child, whether they have a biological connection or not. Your son has stood up and said \"I am willing to stand by this child and support them, come hell or high water,\" He's been there from the beginning in this child's life and is indicating that he intends to remain in that role, no matter what the future holds.\n\nI can understand why you may be apprehensiveabout what's been done, from a purely pragmatic perspective, but life is about more than pragmatism. At the heart of this is love and I sincerely hope that you can respect those feelings and allow your son to make his choices.\n\nNAH so far - I feel like you're trying to look out for your own child, and now you've expressed your disquiet I hope that you can move past it and be happy for him and his family", "What did you think voicing your opinion would do here? It's not gonna magically erase your sons name from the birth certificate. Its not going to change anything. \n\nYour son is happy and doing well.

She\u2019s family.\n\nThese two statements seem contradictory to me.  If you and your son consider her family already, then what would you have him do differently?  She is his daughter in every way that matters and you yourself called her your granddaughter.\n\nHe consulted a lawyer, talked to the bio dad, weighed the risks himself and decided on the course of action of his own accord.  It might not be what you would do, but you want the best for everyone involved so it's best to let it go and be happy for your growing family.\n\nNAH, I understand your concerns and things could go wrong, but even the most stable family situations can go off the rails in unplanned ways no matter how risk averse you are.", "NAH - you have a legit concern. Your son doesn't quite understand the full picture. He is doing something he feels is right and is a great gesture. Not really understanding the full legal repercussions.  \n\nHe could just have easily become the kids Dad by proxy and action. He is not married, no longterm connection to this woman, she may be extremely malicious.  \n\nAND it also means she can't get child support from the bio dad.

Just give advice where you can and only when he asks for it.", "YTA - you can't call the child your granddaughter and also say it's a mistake.", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't have a fence to be on.  \nHe's 25.  \nBack off.  \nYou and your wife are meddling.", "YTA\n\nHe wants to be a Dad. Good for him. Yeah he would pay child support. He'd also get to see his kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I get it. You're a mom worried about her son. That's normal. You said your piece. Now, just enjoy your grandkid!", "YTA.\n\nThe only person who thinks this is a \"recipe for disaster\" is you.

This is an objectively stupid thing to do.", "While I understand your concerns I'm going YTA for saying he shouldn't have done this,  being worried about future child support while calling her your granddaughter all in the same breath. You want yourself and son to pick and choose what aspects of family you participate in here and it's hypocritical.", "YTA. I understand that you\u2019re looking out for your son\u2019s well being, I do. But I think there could have been a better way to approach this. \n\nYour son clearly loves this person and their kid, and as you said she doesn\u2019t seem to be playing around with him for money. I think it\u2019s a bad move in general to pull the whole \u201cwElL iF yOu BrEaK uP\u201d thing and harp on it when someone is clearly happy and healthy in their relationship.\n\nI think this also somewhat devalues your son\u2019s role as a father to this girl. Sure, she\u2019s not his dna. But she\u2019s his daughter nonetheless. Are you suggesting that if he did split with this woman, that his love for this girl and role as her dad would suddenly just evaporate? That he would cut and run? He loves this child. You threw that back in his face.", "YTA. He wants to be Cadence\u2019s father. June wants him to be Cadence\u2019s father. This bio dad is aware of what\u2019s happening and doesn\u2019t care. Cadence will not be kept in the dark about her paternity. That sounds like a happy ending to me so I don\u2019t understand why you have a problem with it. The real reason you\u2019re upset about this is you were hoping your son would have time to back out of this situation and now you know that he doesn\u2019t. You don\u2019t believe your son\u2019s relationship will work out and you wanted him to have an easy exit path. Maybe that\u2019s what you would want but it\u2019s not what he wants. You need to find a way to accept this or you\u2019re going to lose your son.", "NTA.\n\nYou son just walked into something that most people won't be doing.

He *wants* to be in the hook for child support by his own admission, so I think it was pointless to bring up. So YTA for making this a statement of fact rather than a discussion about your concerns for him. \n\nBut now that you have and he has made it clear he\u2019s committed, you have to accept that. Whether it makes you uncomfortable or not is irrelevant. You\u2019re not doing it. And if you think it\u2019s a mistake enough to risk a relationship with your grandchild/future grandchildren I think that makes you kind of a dumbass.", "YTA. i get that you're trying to look out for your son and make sure he's aware of potential consequences but what's done is done and it's not really your place. he's a grown-ass adult and he can make his own choices, in fact he already has: maybe if you'd discussed it before he made the decision you wouldn't be in the wrong but what's the point in guilting him for a choice that he's already made and that he feels good about, what can that achieve? he can't go back on the birth certificate now so what do you want to happen by voicing your concerns? if you don't have a clear answer to that then you bringing it up is pointless and will just make everyone in the situation feel worse. If you disagree or think it's a mistake then you have to either get on board or don't voice your opinion (preferably the former).", "YTA! This is similar to my story. Except I wasn't pregnant and it wasn't a baby, she was 4, almost 5. His momma claimed to love my child. Then we had my second child. A few months after she was born, my now husband and bio father of my youngest, and I went do to our local vital records and he signed her birth certificate, right then and there. I was the only name on her birth certificate, no one signed as a father. So, all he had to do was sign. His momma didn't care and actually started out casting my oldest. But when the youngest came around, my oldest was put on the back burner. My husband and I asked her one day, why she treated the children so differently. Her response was that she doesn't know how to accept a blended family and he's only a stepdad, disregarding the fact that he legally became her father. Funny part about it is, she has 3 kids, but none of them have the same daddy and she's not with any of them. All of her children were bred with different partners but she doesn't know how to accept a blended family. We've gone no contact with her. You sound just like my awful mother in law and if you don't want it, your son will go no contact to focus on his, HIS, family. That's HIS child, regardless if they don't share genetics. HE CHOSE to take on the responsibility of being a child's father. He CHOSE to step up for a child he didn't have to. Your son chose to be an honorable man. The least you can do is respect him for it and show some respect to his partner and his daughter.", "NAH. You seem to be accepting of his daughter and the issue is that you voiced your opinion on a matter of signature. Maybe it's none of your business, but I don't think it's a big deal to have said your opinion.

It\u2019s not up to you if it\u2019s a mistake- it\u2019s his life and his decisions. He loves his girls and believes in this. \n\nI might be just guessing, but you are taking his actions as a direct reflection of your parenting. You don\u2019t agree with his choice.

In a possible future he and June might break up he has to pay child support. Boo hooo. That little girl might lose her whole family.  You also called your granddaughter a mistake. Those two things are contradictorty. He's an adult and talked to a lawyer.  Just because he wasnt the one who impregnated June doesn't mean that Cadence isn't his baby.

He has chosen this little girl and her mom.", "NAH. That is a legit concern. Pretty sure if they broke up which is what happens with most relationships that she could go after him for child support and also because he isn\u2019t the BIO dad he could end up with no rights with the child if broken up. That is what has happened in many situations when a woman cheats and a guy unknowingly raises someone else\u2019s kid they end up stuck with child support and no right to see the child. Hopefully they don\u2019t break up and if they do break up hopefully she isn\u2019t one of the crazy vindictive woman that use children against the man.

If you had brought it up *before* he put his name on the birth certificate, that would be one thing, but doing it after the fact when it's too late to change anything makes you an AH.", "NTA for expressing your concerns. I was going w/NAH, but then saw his requirement that if you're \"not on board\" he won't let you see the child. \n\nIn fact, his signing the certificate can be considered paternity fraud.

Second, the couple would be committing paternity fraud.  \nThe proper legal course of action in this instance is for the man to file for adoption of the child once the child is born. The mother and potential adoptive father would have to find the biological father and notify him of their intent, and ask him to legally relinquish his paternity rights to the child.\"\n\n[https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/can-someone-who-is-not-the-biological-father-sign-the-birth-certificate](https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/can-someone-who-is-not-the-biological-father-sign-the-birth-certificate)", "NTA.

He always has. It\u2019s gotten him into trouble quite a few times.\n\nA little over a year ago, he met June (23). She was 12 weeks pregnant at the time, father no way in sight. Peter and June moved really fast. She was living with him just 4 months later. He told me that he was going to help her with the baby which I was on the fence about as they had just met but also figured it\u2019s not my business and it\u2019s honorable of him to want to help his girlfriend with her baby. \n\nJune had a baby girl, Cadence, 6 months ago. Peter has been heavily involved in her life. Recently, he proposed to June.\n\nWe went to their place to celebrate the big news. That\u2019s when my wife I\u2019ve asked if Peter had plans to adopt Cadence. June and Peter avoided the subject and my wife let it drop, figuring it may be tricky, especially if Cadence\u2019s bio dad didn\u2019t want to relinquish rights. \n\nLater on, after Cadence was put to bed, June and Peter admitted that he wouldn\u2019t have to adopt Cadence as he\u2019s on the birth certificate. I asked wasn\u2019t that fraud. He said after speaking to a lawyer, even if it made it to court, there\u2019s no legal repercussions. Their reasoning for doing this is Peter will have equal say in Cadence\u2019s life. If for whatever reason they broke up, he\u2019d get custody.

She actually comes from a wealthier family and works for her dad\u2019s company. I genuinely believe they just love each other but to me, this is a recipe for disaster. \n\nI tried to let it go. Then, Peter stopped by the house for something and we got to talking about Cadence. Peter called her \u201chis daughter\u201d and I said I\u2019m glad he loves her, but him signing the birth certificate was a huge mistake. I pointed out all the things that could go wrong. He said he doesn\u2019t care and wants to do right by \u201chis girls\u201d.

Once that\u2019s all said and done, if your son decides to do this than he\u2019s a bigger man than any of us, ask him what type of assistance he\u2019ll need from you carrying forward if you\u2019re able to help your newly saddled son.", "NTA.

I\u2019m sorry I think people read posts and see what they want. For those bringing up the concern about adoption versus the certificate, his wife asked and not him. Further, it is not clarified if her asking is an endorsement or clarification.\n\nWe all know the high outcome for divorce. Seems most now are expected to have a \u201cstarter marriage\u201d. However, children are a commitment you cannot just walk away from. They also shouldn\u2019t be. However, as a father of Peter, I\u2019d be concerned. He is accepting the role of the biological father with little time invested in this relationship. This comes with financial and personal sacrifices for years.\n\nI understand helping her and trying to be a good role model or whatever, but I think I wouldn\u2019t endorse or encourage adoption or signing a birth certificate without much more time invested. He\u2019s 25 and frankly this appears to be a case of smitten and wanting to do the \u201cright thing\u201d contrary to the biological father. Some will see this as noble, but others are going to see his as picking up another man\u2019s responsibility (or noble for picking up another man\u2019s responsibility). For those that say neither, than why sign anything?\n\nFor me, I think I would be much more supportive of an adoption IF my son had established more of a commitment and investment with June. I would at a minimum concerned with his decision making and impulse control with new relationships. It is done now and all could turn out fine. However, this could result in a girl that he dated for a year and resulting in a lifelong commitment far past the expiration of the union. Maybe he just wants to be a dad. Maybe he loves the kid regardless of her. Even than, you can act in that role without adoption or signing the birth certificate. Some states may default you as \u201cdad\u201d. I think that is a terrible law though and meant to saddle someone with financial burden (anyone) accept the state. It could (and likely is) ripe with abuse. I hardly think it is the checkmate/gotcha argument because your state sucks.", "YTA, if your concern was only the turmoil in the future if the bio dad decides he wants custody, I could understand.

He decided to have a child with her so even if they split, he\u2019ll have to coparent with her until Cadence turns 18 and most likely, beyond. Which if you\u2019re not reasonably sure you want to deal with this person for the rest of your life, having a child with them is exactly the wrong thing to do.\n\nAs for the birth certificate I actually think it\u2019s a pretty smart move.

Bio dads can file for paternity. But the court will look at the child's best interest. If the child already has a father, to get paternity a bio dad will have to demonstrate to the court that it is in the best interest of the child to terminate the rights of the current father.\n\nHow would that go?\n\n\\+/- the child is still young enough to forget his father and bond to bio dad. \n\n\\+/- the child does not have any siblings yet\n\n\\- the child is currently living in a two parent household. If paternity is changed, the child will have to alternate between single parent households.\n\n\\- the child's current father has been acting as a father for 6 months now. Bio dad is an unknown factor. \n\n\\- the child's current father (probably) has more income and earning potential than bio dad, and is more able to financially support the child (even after a break up, through child support). \n\n\\- the child's bio dad has *knowingly and willingly* not taken steps to file for paternity for 6 months\n\n\\- the child's bio dad has *knowingly and willingly* not taken steps to request contact with the child for 6 months\n\nSo basically, we have two points where a change in paternity would still be \"neutral\" for the child's best interest, but only temporarily. We already have a lot of points where a change in paternity would be detrimental to the child's best interest.", "There is as if bio dad changes his mind the op son can lose all rights.

But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s OP\u2018s concern, anyway.", "Not necessarily. He could easily state that he wasn\u2019t consulted or even that he wasn\u2019t aware his child existed and it would mostly be his word against theirs unless they have actually documented proof that he had no interest.

He'd still stand enough of a chance to be very inconvenient.", "Sure, but at the same time this is a really sensitive subject: no matter how OP says it, OP's son probably hears it as him basically saying that he shouldn't have had his daughter.

That's a huge and risky decision.", "I understand and I definitely see that that is the downside of it but regardless I still think OP did the right thing (considering he was sensitive at the moment he communicated his opinion of course, but judging by his writing alone I see no reason to doubt that for now). Sometimes the truth hurts!\n\nIf his son is 100% sure of his decision I don\u2019t think this should hurt him hin in the slightest. My partner was in a similar situation when he first met me, he loved everything about me and I was the complete opposite of what he used to tell people he wanted in life. His family were skeptical and they voiced their opinion about this decision before even knowing me well, but my partner stood his ground and insisted they should give it a chance so they get to meet me.\n\nFast forward and we have been married happily for 8 years. I do not see their honest worry for their child was ever a reason for bad blood and they love me entirely so it never became an issue. Now had my husband had 1% doubt about me I think it would have been a reason for bad blood (or had I made a big deal about it).\n\nI know I\u2019m not an adopted child but the example conveys the message I am trying to send lol", "Honestly it could be that it comes down to culture playing a role here. An individualistic vs collectivistic society and how much importance people give to family life and opinion. I am not familiarized with this sort of regulations and documentation so I really cannot agree based on that alone. I still think honesty is the best policy. I would want my parents to warn me about someone I am deciding to be linked with for the rest of my life if they see my opinion is clouded by my personality. Better to have the people who raised me judging rather than running into issues in the future. \n\nThen again I would ask for my parents\u2019 blessing in the first place because I love them and I respect their opinion, even if I do not plan to follow it.
