He always has. It\u2019s gotten him into trouble quite a few times.\n\nA little over a year ago, he met June (23). She was 12 weeks pregnant at the time, father no way in sight. Peter and June moved really fast. She was living with him just 4 months later. He told me that he was going to help her with the baby which I was on the fence about as they had just met but also figured it\u2019s not my business and it\u2019s honorable of him to want to help his girlfriend with her baby. \n\nJune had a baby girl, Cadence, 6 months ago. Peter has been heavily involved in her life. Recently, he proposed to June.\n\nWe went to their place to celebrate the big news. That\u2019s when my wife asked if Peter had plans to adopt Cadence. June and Peter avoided the subject and my wife let it drop, figuring it may be tricky, especially if Cadence\u2019s bio dad didn\u2019t want to relinquish rights. \n\nLater on, after Cadence was put to bed, June and Peter admitted that he wouldn\u2019t have to adopt Cadence as he\u2019s on the birth certificate. I asked wasn\u2019t that fraud. He said after speaking to a lawyer, even if it made it to court, there\u2019s no legal repercussions. Their reasoning for doing this is Peter will have equal say in Cadence\u2019s life. If for whatever reason they broke up, he\u2019d get custody. I instantly thought \u201cand he\u2019d be on the hook for child support\u201d. But I stayed quiet.\n\nMy wife asked if they planned on telling Cadence the truth and they said yes, it won\u2019t be a secret. The bio dad is also aware and doesn\u2019t care as he has no desire to be a dad.\n\nI don\u2019t think that June is trying to get money out of him. She actually comes from a wealthier family and works for her dad\u2019s company. I genuinely believe they just love each other but to me, this is a recipe for disaster. \n\nI tried to let it go. Then, Peter stopped by the house for something and we got to talking about Cadence. Peter called her \u201chis daughter\u201d and I said I\u2019m glad he loves her, but him signing the birth certificate was a huge mistake. I pointed out all the things that could go wrong. He said he doesn\u2019t care and wants to do right by \u201chis girls\u201d. He called me unsupportive and told me to either get on board or I won\u2019t get to be in my granddaughter\u2019s life.\n\nI love my granddaughter, blood doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s family.

Additionally, it doesn't make him an asshole to say, \"I've already thought about this a lot and don't share your concerns.\"\n\nBut now that you've said your piece and he's heard you, you need to drop it. You will be the asshole if you don't get on board. Your son is an adult, he's made an adult decision.

It will only drive a wedge between you and him.", "I think what your son did was an incredibly noble move. Far too many individuals out there will turn tail and run from a child, whether they have a biological connection or not. Your son has stood up and said \"I am willing to stand by this child and support them, come hell or high water,\" He's been there from the beginning in this child's life and is indicating that he intends to remain in that role, no matter what the future holds.\n\nI can understand why you may be apprehensiveabout what's been done, from a purely pragmatic perspective, but life is about more than pragmatism. At the heart of this is love and I sincerely hope that you can respect those feelings and allow your son to make his choices.\n\nNAH so far - I feel like you're trying to look out for your own child, and now you've expressed your disquiet I hope that you can move past it and be happy for him and his family", "What did you think voicing your opinion would do here? It's not gonna magically erase your sons name from the birth certificate. Its not going to change anything. \n\nYour son is happy and doing well.

She\u2019s family.\n\nThese two statements seem contradictory to me.  If you and your son consider her family already, then what would you have him do differently?  She is his daughter in every way that matters and you yourself called her your granddaughter.\n\nHe consulted a lawyer, talked to the bio dad, weighed the risks himself and decided on the course of action of his own accord.  It might not be what you would do, but you want the best for everyone involved so it's best to let it go and be happy for your growing family.\n\nSoft YTA to NAH, I understand your concerns and things could go wrong, but even the most stable family situations can go off the rails in unplanned ways no matter how risk averse you are.", "NAH - you have a legit concern. Your son doesn't quite understand the full picture. He is doing something he feels is right and is a great gesture.

He is not married, no longterm connection to this woman, she may be extremely malicious.  \n\nAND it also means she can't get child support from the bio dad.

Just give advice where you can and only when he asks for it.", "YTA - you can't call the child your granddaughter and also say it's a mistake.", "YTA. \n\nYou didn't have a fence to be on.  \nHe's 25.  \nBack off.  \nYou and your wife are meddling.", "YTA\n\nHe wants to be a Dad. Good for him. Yeah he would pay child support. He'd also get to see his kid.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I get it. You're a mom worried about her son. That's normal. You said your piece.

This is an objectively stupid thing to do.", "While I understand your concerns I'm going YTA for saying he shouldn't have done this,  being worried about future child support while calling her your granddaughter all in the same breath. You want yourself and son to pick and choose what aspects of family you participate in here and it's hypocritical.", "YTA. I understand that you\u2019re looking out for your son\u2019s well being, I do. But I think there could have been a better way to approach this. \n\nYour son clearly loves this person and their kid, and as you said she doesn\u2019t seem to be playing around with him for money. I think it\u2019s a bad move in general to pull the whole \u201cwElL iF yOu BrEaK uP\u201d thing and harp on it when someone is clearly happy and healthy in their relationship.\n\nI think this also somewhat devalues your son\u2019s role as a father to this girl. Sure, she\u2019s not his dna. But she\u2019s his daughter nonetheless. Are you suggesting that if he did split with this woman, that his love for this girl and role as her dad would suddenly just evaporate? That he would cut and run? He loves this child. You threw that back in his face.", "YTA. He wants to be Cadence\u2019s father. June wants him to be Cadence\u2019s father. This bio dad is aware of what\u2019s happening and doesn\u2019t care. Cadence will not be kept in the dark about her paternity. That sounds like a happy ending to me so I don\u2019t understand why you have a problem with it. The real reason you\u2019re upset about this is you were hoping your son would have time to back out of this situation and now you know that he doesn\u2019t. You don\u2019t believe your son\u2019s relationship will work out and you wanted him to have an easy exit path. Maybe that\u2019s what you would want but it\u2019s not what he wants. You need to find a way to accept this or you\u2019re going to lose your son.", "NTA.\n\nYou son just walked into something that most people won't be doing.

He *wants* to be in the hook for child support by his own admission, so I think it was pointless to bring up. So YTA for making this a statement of fact rather than a discussion about your concerns for him. \n\nBut now that you have and he has made it clear he\u2019s committed, you have to accept that. Whether it makes you uncomfortable or not is irrelevant. You\u2019re not doing it. And if you think it\u2019s a mistake enough to risk a relationship with your grandchild/future grandchildren I think that makes you kind of a dumbass.", "YTA. i get that you're trying to look out for your son and make sure he's aware of potential consequences but what's done is done and it's not really your place. he's a grown-ass adult and he can make his own choices, in fact he already has: maybe if you'd discussed it before he made the decision you wouldn't be in the wrong but what's the point in guilting him for a choice that he's already made and that he feels good about, what can that achieve? he can't go back on the birth certificate now so what do you want to happen by voicing your concerns? if you don't have a clear answer to that then you bringing it up is pointless and will just make everyone in the situation feel worse. If you disagree or think it's a mistake then you have to either get on board or don't voice your opinion (preferably the former).", "YTA! This is similar to my story. Except I wasn't pregnant and it wasn't a baby, she was 4, almost 5. His momma claimed to love my child. Then we had my second child. A few months after she was born, my now husband and bio father of my youngest, and I went do to our local vital records and he signed her birth certificate, right then and there. I was the only name on her birth certificate, no one signed as a father. So, all he had to do was sign. His momma didn't care and actually started out casting my oldest. But when the youngest came around, my oldest was put on the back burner. My husband and I asked her one day, why she treated the children so differently. Her response was that she doesn't know how to accept a blended family and he's only a stepdad, disregarding the fact that he legally became her father. Funny part about it is, she has 3 kids, but none of them have the same daddy and she's not with any of them. All of her children were bred with different partners but she doesn't know how to accept a blended family. We've gone no contact with her. You sound just like my awful mother in law and if you don't want it, your son will go no contact to focus on his, HIS, family. That's HIS child, regardless if they don't share genetics. HE CHOSE to take on the responsibility of being a child's father. He CHOSE to step up for a child he didn't have to. Your son chose to be an honorable man. The least you can do is respect him for it and show some respect to his partner and his daughter.", "NAH. You seem to be accepting of his daughter and the issue is that you voiced your opinion on a matter of signature. Maybe it's none of your business, but I don't think it's a big deal to have said your opinion.

In a possible future he and June might break up he has to pay child support. Boo hooo. That little girl might lose her whole family.  You also called your granddaughter a mistake. Those two things are contradictorty. He's an adult and talked to a lawyer.  Just because he wasnt the one who impregnated June doesn't mean that Cadence isn't his baby.

He has chosen this little girl and her mom.", "NAH. That is a legit concern. Pretty sure if they broke up which is what happens with most relationships that she could go after him for child support and also because he isn\u2019t the BIO dad he could end up with no rights with the child if broken up. That is what has happened in many situations when a woman cheats and a guy unknowingly raises someone else\u2019s kid they end up stuck with child support and no right to see the child. Hopefully they don\u2019t break up and if they do break up hopefully she isn\u2019t one of the crazy vindictive woman that use children against the man.

If you had brought it up *before* he put his name on the birth certificate, that would be one thing, but doing it after the fact when it's too late to change anything makes you an AH.", "NTA for expressing your concerns. I was going w/NAH, but then saw his requirement that if you're \"not on board\" he won't let you see the child. \n\nIn fact, his signing the certificate can be considered paternity fraud.

Second, the couple would be committing paternity fraud.  \nThe proper legal course of action in this instance is for the man to file for adoption of the child once the child is born. The mother and potential adoptive father would have to find the biological father and notify him of their intent, and ask him to legally relinquish his paternity rights to the child.\"\n\n[https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/can-someone-who-is-not-the-biological-father-sign-the-birth-certificate](https://www.oflaherty-law.com/learn-about-law/can-someone-who-is-not-the-biological-father-sign-the-birth-certificate)", "NTA.

He always has. It\u2019s gotten him into trouble quite a few times.\n\nA little over a year ago, he met June (23). She was 12 weeks pregnant at the time, father no way in sight. Peter and June moved really fast. She was living with him just 4 months later. He told me that he was going to help her with the baby which I was on the fence about as they had just met but also figured it\u2019s not my business and it\u2019s honorable of him to want to help his girlfriend with her baby. \n\nJune had a baby girl, Cadence, 6 months ago. Peter has been heavily involved in her life. Recently, he proposed to June.\n\nWe went to their place to celebrate the big news. That\u2019s when my wife I\u2019ve asked if Peter had plans to adopt Cadence. June and Peter avoided the subject and my wife let it drop, figuring it may be tricky, especially if Cadence\u2019s bio dad didn\u2019t want to relinquish rights. \n\nLater on, after Cadence was put to bed, June and Peter admitted that he wouldn\u2019t have to adopt Cadence as he\u2019s on the birth certificate. I asked wasn\u2019t that fraud. He said after speaking to a lawyer, even if it made it to court, there\u2019s no legal repercussions. Their reasoning for doing this is Peter will have equal say in Cadence\u2019s life. If for whatever reason they broke up, he\u2019d get custody. I instantly thought \u201cand he\u2019d be on the hook for child support\u201d. But I stayed quiet.\n\nMy wife asked if they planned on telling Cadence the truth and they said yes, it won\u2019t be a secret. The bio dad is also aware and doesn\u2019t care as he has no desire to be a dad.\n\nI don\u2019t think that June is trying to get money out of him. She actually comes from a wealthier family and works for her dad\u2019s company. I genuinely believe they just love each other but to me, this is a recipe for disaster. \n\nI tried to let it go. Then, Peter stopped by the house for something and we got to talking about Cadence. Peter called her \u201chis daughter\u201d and I said I\u2019m glad he loves her, but him signing the birth certificate was a huge mistake. I pointed out all the things that could go wrong. He said he doesn\u2019t care and wants to do right by \u201chis girls\u201d. He called me unsupportive and told me to either get on board or I won\u2019t get to be in my granddaughter\u2019s life.\n\nI love my granddaughter, blood doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s family.

It's the bio dad who will have a harder time proving his rights. You just don't walk up in court and demand a DNA test. They'll have to prove that it is likely he is the father before the court agrees to order a test.
