If you have a tenant (who is paying your low rate) she can still rent her house at her rate. If you have a tenant in place, that rent doesn't effect her or her potential renters at all. Its only when you both have vacancies, when you and she are competing for renters, that your lower rate effects what she or her potential renters do.", "NTA - you're my hero.

If they want to change it make a ridiculous offer for your house.  \n\nPlus, one home in the neighborhood with low rent doesn't affect anything.

Charging below marker rates are a good way to ensure they stay in your unit and stay your good tenant", "NTA. Good for you.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house.

Maybe she should try that thing called \"getting a job\" instead.", "NTA - what you are doing is very generous.  I'm left genuinely wondering, though, if you're paying for things like maintenance and upkeep out of pocket?  What happens if the furnace breaks or if the tenant clogs up a pipe?  Flood damage?  Special assessments?  Taxes?  Insurance?  Renters skip payment or cause damage that can't be covered out of the deposit?  I'm really just wondering how expenses outside of the mortgage are covered (and not trying to be pushy about, I promise, even though it may not come across on the screen that way)", "If you have multiple properties in the same area you could drive prices down. But if they are spread out one property is not a big deal.", "NAH\n\nWhat you're doing works for you, and is a stroke of luck for your tenants. But I will say that \"covers your mortgage\" means you're charging less than break even for other landlords. Between maintenance, HOA fees, and all the other miscellaneous costs break even for a landlord in my area is about 150% of what I pay for my mortgage. One of the many reasons I'm not a landlord.", "Landlords are evil, and the fact you\u2019re a foreign landlord gives Bond villain status but this is a chill move. HOA\u2019s are also evil so angering them doubles the chill factor.", "NTA but you should have a good CPA for taxes. Renting below fair market value (not defined by a neighbor\u2019s opinion though) may have tax implications.", "NTA. You can rent out the properties for whatever you want. But be prepared to start losing a lot of money.\n\nI'm an electrician that has spent the last 6-7 years working with a few property owners and investors keeping me busy. And a couple of them are not afraid to talk numbers with me. So I know mostly what they are spending in between tenants and for maintenance and repairs.\n\nNo renter is going to treat the property as well as you will. And walls, flooring, and cabinets are regularly either destroyed or require at least a bit of work in between tenants , and it may or may not be covered by the deposit. But where you are really going to be spending a lot of money is on things like HVAC. Which depending on the size and layout of the house can run anywhere from 5k-20k+ to replace. And last maybe 15 years the way a lot of units are made. Or the roof that is going to cost between 15k-50k that needs to be replaced after 20-30 years.\n\nOr any water intrusion or plumbing issues. Or any appliances that were there when renters moved in must be maintained. And any of these issues must be fixed I'mmediately. You can't just tell a tenant that you need to wait a couple weeks to get the AC/Heat, or plumbing, or electrical, or anything fixed because you need to set up financing to afford it. And any company that offers their own financing for work is generally going to be 1.5-2.5x the cost of competitors, plus the interest you will be paying.\n\nI mean you might have good years and good tenants, oland only have on average say $50/month per unit for the time they are living there.  But it's easy to have houses require say $250-$500 a month over spread over 5 years. And it can be more than that if you are having to replace a lot of big ticket items.\n\nI mean it's really nice of you to rent out houses at significantly cheaper rates than market value. But there is a reason that market value is what it is. And it's not to make profit month to month. Even at market value it is easy to lose money consistently. And only start breaking even or making anything after having the place for 5-10 as market rate goes up. Or break even/lose money until it is completely paid off. \n\nIf you can afford to float the losses until you sell, and incorporate them into the total profit/loss more power to you. Just don't go in blindly thinking that everything will be alright, and then panic the first time you have a 10k repair bill.", "Just like people who believe their property has a higher rental value, you have the right to charge what you want. Here the unpopular opinion part - low rent has a tendency to bring in people you may not want to rent to or have in a neighborhood. Peeps, downvote away :)", "INFO: This is odd. How do you neighbors know your rental rate? Also, the supply and demand market dynamics should solve this: When your property (or plural) are rented, the remaining properties in the HOA for rent will be occupied.", "This is a repost.", "A single rental property is not going to affect the costs of all the other rental properties or distract the market from the area.  Once there's a renter in that property, it's no longer available for rent.  If other landlords are unable to profit off their properties, they can liquidate them and invest elsewhere.\n\nAs an aside, you are not necessarily in a \"fortunate\" position, being in a highly leveraged position as you are.  We're not 3 years away from an event where being a landlord certain states basically meant you aren't collecting rent for upwards of a year and at the same time can't liquidate your investment because there's an unevictable tenant living in it.  So faced with the potential of that or any number of other issues that a landlord might face, you further put yourself at risk by not providing yourself with any extra margin on the rent income side.

I was down about $6k after 7 months (including lower rent, new water heater, etc.), but I chalked that up to the price of helping people.  The problem is that the family did not respect the space, the HOA rules, or their neighbors at all.\n\nLong story short, they destroyed half the furniture and caused damage to the home that cost me well over $7k to repair.  And that was without replacing the formerly-beautiful, 5-year-old quartz countertops that the family had destroyed the finish on and discolored terribly.  Don\u2019t ask me how they even managed to do that since quartz is supposed to be indestructible.\n\nJust wanted to prepare you for the very real possibility that your tenants may not respect your space the way you do, and that some people respond to kindness and giving back with destruction and greed.
