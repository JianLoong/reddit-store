{"id": 26721, "submission_id": "16gvhhg", "title": "AITA for banning my stepsister\u2019s foster daughter from my house?", "selftext": "My (31F) stepsister \u201cAria\u201d (33F) has been fostering a girl called \u201cGrace\u201d (8F) for about a year. Aria and her husband \u201cDan\u201d have been fostering with the view of someday adopting for 2 years, a decision they made when they found out Aria couldn\u2019t have biological kids. Grace is their second placement. \n\nGrace has behaviour problems, and we knew this in advance because Aria mentioned it but honestly I wasn\u2019t exactly prepared. Tantrums, bullying the other children, bad language, mean to the pets at home, possessive behaviour, you name it, Grace has exhibited it. I know this can be the case with traumatised kids so we\u2019ve tried to let a lot of things slide as Aira and Dan tried to help Grace adjust, but it\u2019s been hard and unpleasant. We\u2019re a close knit family so our parents, siblings and families get together most weekends, but me and our other siblings have begun to dread these encounters because it seems like we never have one event without Grace creating an issue. Even my parents have been getting fed up.\n\nThe final straw for me was last weekend. My husband and I hosted a family barbecue at our place. My daughter (6) and Grace were playing in my daughter\u2019s playhouse until she came out upset. It turned out Grace had broken a bunch of things in the playhouse. When asked what had caused the outburst, Grace burst into tears and accused my daughter of bullying her, calling her dirty, unwanted, stupid, poor, and all sort of things which are all a lie. My daughter is six, she doesn\u2019t have enough understanding of why those words would hurt Grace in order to use them. My daughter\u2019s version of events is that Grace said something about the girls being cousins and my daughter said Grace isn\u2019t her cousin because she\u2019s not Aria and Dan\u2019s child. I can understand how this would Upset Grace but it\u2019s a totally different story that the one she told and no amount of hurt could excuse the destruction she caused. \n\nI said to Aria and Dan that I wouldn\u2019t allow Grace to visit anymore. That means someone else will have to host holidays, and we will make a decision on an ad hoc basis whether we will attend (my daughter is very upset about what happened and understandably doesn\u2019t want to see Grace for a while). This has led to our parents saying it\u2019s not fair that they miss out seeing their granddaughter, and that since Grace is the one who behaved poorly, Aria and Dan should bow out of future events. \n\nAria is saying that I am evil for forcing the rest of the family to ostracise a traumatised child, and that I need to take this all back. Dan on the other hand, is siding with me and the parents. Aria has also said this is causing issues since they were looking into adopting Grace but this whole issue has made Dan reticent since obviously they won\u2019t be adopting her with the full support of the family. Aria is saying I\u2019m essentially denying Grace a family, but I feel like I\u2019m just trying to protect mine. So, am I the AH?\n\nEdit: For everyone who didn\u2019t realise, I edited what Grace said for brevity. For example, Grace didn\u2019t literally say \u201cunwanted\u201d she said \u201cshe said nobody loves me and they\u2019re going to send me back\u201d, she didn\u2019t say \u201cdirty\u201d, she said \u201cshe said I\u2019m dirty and I have lice and insects\u201d, etc. which are things my daughter wouldn\u2019t say. She had lice at 3, I bought she remembers what lice are and she definitely doesn\u2019t know they\u2019re generally perceived as a hygiene concern. She doesn\u2019t know what foster care is so I don\u2019t know where she would think they were going \u201csend Grace back\u201d. Grace has heard these things somewhere but I don\u2019t believe she heard them from my daughter, and I know neither child has heard it from me or my family, because we simply don\u2019t speak like that. \n\nSecond, for everyone discussing how my daughter knows Grace isn\u2019t her cousin, my daughter has cousins, she knows that a cousin is the child of your aunt or uncle, and she knows Dan and Aria aren\u2019t Grace\u2019s parents. She knows this because we explained a year ago that Grace is staying with Dan and Aria because her parents weren\u2019t able to take care of her, which is what we said when Grace was first placed with them (we didn\u2019t know they planned to adopt her, Aria only told me this two days ago during our fight).", "created_utc": 1694535128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16gvhhg/aita_for_banning_my_stepsisters_foster_daughter/", "score": 1546, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Until Gracie has had enough professional therapy she shouldnt be given free reign to everyone and everything. Your daughter is far too young to be able to defend herself from those attacks. You are responsible for protecting your kid, thats what you're doing.", "NTA - Aria and Dan should be required to have better supervision of Grace at family gatherings.", "NTA. It's not for you to fix. Yes, it's awful Grace is traumatized, but it doesn't make it ok for her to hurt your own daughter. Aria and Dan need to grow up and be the adults. She can't learn that she will get whatever she wants in life by throwing tantrums and people just listen because they feel sorry for her. I think you did well by setting a boundary, and Aria is acting like a child because you aren't letting her and Grace get what they want, anymore. Adopted, Fostered, or Bio- children need guidance. Aria and Dan aren't guiding her. They're just putting up with her.", "[deleted]", "NTA.  They can't just dump the kid into a large gathering and expect everything to go fine.  They needed to be active and involved and on top of supervision during these meetings and it sounds like they're just expecting the rest of the family to deal with it instead.", "NTA, You aren't responsible for Aria and Dan's inability to cope with Grace's behavior. Your post also reads as though they are enabling the behavior as one (or both) is clearly desperate for child.\n\nIt's right that they stand back at least for the short term, until Grace settles and they all start some kind of family therapy.", "NTA- if it was just the one incident I'd say this was an overreaction, because I could totally get why Grace would be upset at being told she isn't Dan and Aria's child, even if  your daughter doesn't really understand why that would be hurtful. Obviously breaking things is not a good reaction, but again it could be understandable due to her background. However, given that this is part of a larger pattern of behavior I think it's fair to not allow grace over anymore unless Dan and Aria actually start taking responsibility for her behavior and ensuring that if something starts to happen they intervene immediately. Her behavior may be understandable due to past trauma, but that doesn't make it okay for her to bully other children, hurt or be mean or animals, and break things when she's upset. I feel sorry for Grace, but Dan and Aria don't sound like they doing enough to address this behavior. They know she has these issues and they need to be proactive in preventing them, and addressing them appropriately if they do occur. It's not fair to the other kids or the rest of the family that she's basically allowed to do whatever she wants even if it hurts other. It sounds like grace needs foster parents experienced with these kind of behavioral issues. It's not easy to raise a kid while also being a therapist, a doctor, a referee, and often times a punching bag (mentally and physically ). It takes a very specific type of person to fulfill those roles while also teaching the child better coping mechanisms and ensuring they are not treated as a burden or a problem.", "NTA. Its been a year with what seems to be no improvement behavior-wise. You have the right to protect your family and property. Aria and Dan need to focus on getting Grace appropriate professional care (if they're not doing thst already) and looking into parenting classes for themselves.\n\nTbh, I think Dan was already on the fence about adopting Grace before this latest incident. He probably used the ban to start a conversation about their suitability as a long-term placement for Grace.", "Dealing with trauma can take a lot of time and some parents deal with it better than others. Grace should be having regular counseling sessions, as should Aria and Dan have meetings with a child psychologist and social worker about how best to deal with such outbursts.\n\nLets think of the Michael Vicks dogs - they all faced horrific situations, yet, some could be placed almost immediately, some needed work, maybe years, before they could be placed in new homes, while some had to stay with the dog experts for life because they could never safely adapt to life outside their caregiving facility. \n\nFoster kids are somewhat the same.

Y'all know that Grace is prone to bullying, tantrums, and bad language, yet you allowed her to hang out alone with your 6yo daughter in the playhouse, where she managed to destroy a bunch of stuff without anyone noticing? What were the adults in the family doing?", "NTA - As a survivor of significant childhood trauma, I can tell you that having lived through it doesn't automatically result in the behaviors you are talking about. \n\nGiven her pattern of troubling actions - most expressly being mean to the pets - it's possible there is other pathology accompanying whatever situational difficulties she has endured. \n\nYou have every right to set boundaries for yourself and your household. It seems to me that doing so is the only way to protect yourselves. \n\nIs your sister getting Grace any help? Is she in therapy?

We don't know if she has experienced abuse or some other trauma, if it's mental illness, etc. It just doesn't matter.  \nGrace is unwilling or unable to behave in an acceptable manner. She has been creating chaos and drama for a year now with no indication that her behavior will improve in time. It's too bad but she can't be allowed to disrupt the entire family every time you gather.", "Your daughter doesn\u2019t have enough understanding of those words but has enough understanding to say that Grace isn\u2019t her cousin because she\u2019s not their child?", "ESH? In any case I feel bad for everyone involved. You adults are not properly supervising those kids, and the blame should not be falling on 8 year old Grace. Also you've clearly done a poor job of explaining Grace's situation to your daughter, and it backfired. As someone else said, it's telling that Grace chose those particular insults to use, they are probably things she has heard about herself... I'd say try suggesting ways to supervise Grace first before jumping into demanding she is not present at family gatherings. This is a severely traunatised child and I hope there is hope for her.", "ESH-- your responsibility was to keep your child safe and make sure that adults are giving reasonable guidance. The other parents should have been there to coach Grace. I hate it when family members assume I will coach their kid with behavior issues. In this case nobody was there acting responsibly to help Grace and your daughter play together calmly. And you get this kind of result (be thankful this is all it was). \n\nIf stepsister & partner weren't stepping up to be responsible for helping Grace get through what is probably disorienting, miserable, and extremely stressful for her (yes, family gatherings are nice for you, but it is probably horrible for her), then you don't let your daughter out of your sight because of what could happen. A knowledgeable adult should have been playing with the kids and keeping things calm. Come on OP, you know this. \n\nThis is clearly a kid who has been abused and traumatized by people very close to her. Reactive attachment disorder features like you describe means that kids are very confused about what family bonds mean, who is safe. In the child's mind they are trying to figure out which is reality-- the way the new family treats them and says that she is safe, or the monstrous one they remember who used to rape, burn, beat them? Which one is really the way families are? Which one is love? Which one do they deserve?\n\nA child Grace's age with this level of a struggle needs very intensive therapeutic parenting and help round the clock. It's not a thing that she can \"get used to\" in a few months. Why do you expect her to easily behave in a way that life has not taught her how? This is a lifelong process for her to learn. \n\nIf you want to get a better idea of what all this may entail, try reading Building the Bonds of Attachment by Hughes. \n\nIf your stepsister is not participating in a high level of ongoing treatment for Grace (including assessment, highly skilled therapy, medication etc) I can see why you may object to the situation, yeah. It's irresponsible towards the child. \n\nYou may want to lower the frequency you have them over so that you do have some times when that part of the family isn't around. But you need to have some serious family communication-- without Grace-- about ground rules, what to avoid saying/doing that may trigger Grace, what your rules are for your home (example: if you allow Grace to break or destroy items, sis, you pay for them). Make it very clear to all adults and child family members what behaviors will not be tolerated: both from Grace herself, and also from the family members toward Grace. \n\nThen do a short version of the meeting with Grace (with a simple visual ) so that she feels like she knows what the rules are. You can get her input on what she feels uncomfortable with, or just observe constantly to see what bothers her. For example, maybe she feels scared in small spaces with another person (a big one for these kids, and you and Stepsis just let it happen like it was no big deal). Maybe she is triggered when people shout or when someone touches her shoulder or walks up behind her. Maybe people giving gifts makes her question reality/intent and she starts breaking things. You will see these things in her expression, body language, or increase of acting out. She may be acting out with explosive tantrums, but can also act out by trying to seem cold-hearted, emotionless, or extremely confident and experienced with sick or frightening situations, towards adults around her.  \n\nProvide Grace a safe place to get feelings out or sensory relief. If I were fostering her I'd have things like a crash pad, trampoline, bubble wrap, paper that's ok to tear, spinning things she can use, etc and if I were bringing her to your house I would bring items with me to help Grace feel like she can get her frustrations or stress out SAFELY. Don't just drop her in the middle of a home with breakable items and another kid whom she might fight with and expect her to behave as you expect when she isn't supervised!! This screams lack of education either on your or Stepsister's part. And don't expect her to think and act on the level of children her age. Her parents may have been on drugs, anything, you don't know how her brain or body works nor her history-- nor is it your right to know, so assume it was horrifying and think and act accordingly towards her. She is showing that is how it was by the way you report she acts. \n\nThere's nothing untrue about what your daughter said, but, geez, with a child who has this much awful baggage she is carrying (and not by choice), the family really should have had a talk ahead of time and discussed how talking about her not being a real member in the family would make Grace feel like shit. It seems as if you and other comments think that Grace 's behavior is \"chosen behavior\"  instead of a fight or flight reaction to what she lived through until now. I bet that Stepsis is telling Grace all about what nice families do and how nice families love each other, and then after going through all the stress of being around at the family BBQ, a kid who grew up in this loving, nice family says (with no ill intent I'm sure) that she isn't really a cousin, not part of the family. \n\nHow confusing and terrifying that must feel. In a child's mind, that translates to things like \"get out,\" \"you don't belong here,\" even though we as grownups know that your kid didn't mean any harm but was being honest. \n\nIf you cut them off, though, you will prove to Grace that she was right when testing boundaries to see what is safe. It will confirm that she is a bad or worthless child and doesn't deserve to be around a \"nice family,\" so, going forward more chances for you to have a break are good but also the parents should be providing her with better coaching and supervision at family gatherings.\n\n(Edited for getting name wrong)", "INFO: you mention that Grace has a history of behaviour problems, including bullying other children. Has there ever been a serious discussion with your sister and your BIL about how to make visits with Grace safe for the other kids, or about what consequences they could expect for her continuing to act out? \n\nI saw you saying elsewhere that you didn't want to burden your sister with the financial cost of replacing the broken toys from the playhouse, which is really thoughtful of you, but it seems as though you've given her a much more difficult burden: fostering (and potentially adopting and raising) a child without getting to enjoy her sister and her family. \n\nI don't mean that Grace's behaviour (acting out and breaking things when she felt unwanted, possibly lying about what happened) is at all appropriate or okay. Your sister should be taking that seriously. But I'm thinking about 1.

I understand that at 6 she  say that to be hurtful but now is a chance to explain why what she said was hurtful and how words can make someone sad.\n\nMy niece has fostered five children and adopted three of them (two were adopted by a friend of hers).  They were all treated as part of the family from the start with love and compassion.  We're Uncle and Auntie, Papa and Gigi, Cousins, and the have little brothers.  We don't differentiate.  The only problem is explaining when the foster care makes the decision to allow the bio-family to have another chance (after they've had 3-5 chances already) - this can be devastating for the whole family, including the innocent child.\n\nAs to Grace's issues, many fosters need therapy for impulse control issues (this is common for children born to drug addicts), obviously I don't know Grace's circumstances but I hope your BIL and SIL are ensuring they are getting all the help they can to give Grace the future she deserves.

Try to come at Aria and Dan with the understanding they are trying to do something clearly complicated and difficult, but that you did not sign on to do so when there are clear consequences in the process to your own family.

If Grace was hitting/hurting/abusing your daughter, or was breaking things every time she came over, I would definitely agree that you'd be N-T-A to no longer invite them to your home (or at least INSIST that Aria & Dan stay WITH her the entire time so she is never unsupervised).  \n\nWhere you may veer into AH territory, is \"...we will make a decision on an ad hoc basis whether we will attend\".  At this point, you really are creating division in the family.  It's no longer just about protecting your own home and boundaries, it's asking your family to choose between you or your sister.  \n\nAlso, you need to talk to your daughter and explain that people are still family even when they're foster/step/adopted family.\n\nMaybe the adults just need to step up and make sure Grace isn't left unsupervised?", "ESH but as someone know loves former foster kids, excluding her now would be really damaging. If she isn\u2019t already in therapy, she really should be. Kids don\u2019t know how to process trauma (neither do a lot of adults). \n\nI don\u2019t blame you for wanting to make sure that you kid is safe and not put in that position again, but I also would ask you to consider not a permanent ban, but create reasonable boundaries and enforce them. Hold your sister and niece to them. \n\nI also want you to remember that your foster niece heard those things somewhere and believes them. Please don\u2019t reinforce it. And never let her hear any of the arguments happening about her. One negative word can hold more power than a million positive ones. \n\nI\u2019d really encourage your whole family to look into trauma informed care education. I can give a recommendation for someone I know and trust. It\u2019s aimed more for educators but can really help anyone understand working with children who have experience trauma. \n\nI will say, it is not your job to help your foster niece. However, if your sister and husband are serious about adopting out of the system, these kids come with trauma THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. Learning to love a kid who doesn\u2019t know how to receive love is hard. Learning to love a kid as they continually reprocess their trauma is hard. Your whole family should sit down and have a larger conversation about how to move forward with those thoughts in mind.", "YTA... the fact that your daughter rubbed in her face that she isn't her cousin is gross. If Grace is adopted then she would actually be her cousin. Technicalities though right? How are you positive that all of the children are sweet little angels and Grace is just a terrible child?

That\u2019s a shitty thing to think let alone say, especially when your daughter can pick up on it and repeat. your sister is probably in pain from not being able to carry a pregnancy/give birth, Grace is traumatized from whatever situation she came from.

Think about what her daily life was like when she was your daughter's age. And think about what it must feel like for an eight year old who is trying to forge a bond with a child she regards as a cousin to be rejected (no fault on your daughter for being logical here, but you certainly can't blame the child for having hurt feelings.)\n\nThe logical step is to sit down with Aria and Dan and figure out how to prevent a smilar scenario in the future without punishing a traumatized eight year old for years for behaving like a traumatized eight year old.\n\nSheesh.", "You\u2019re not wrong for taking a break from Grace but  I feel bad for her the most out of this.

Kids will be kids, that means emotional outbursts and breaking things", "NTA with a little bit of E S H/N A H.\n\nThis case isn't so easy to categorise in my opinion.\n\nGrace is probably traumatised, especially if Aria and Dan aren't her first placement.\n\nI work with challenging kids, mostly ASD and ADHD, but also traumatised, so I think I can put in a cent or two.\n\nWhen kids are traumatised or suffer from abandonment issues, they start to push you away. They are actively sabotaging their (foster) relationships, cause in their heads they are sure to get abandoned again. Cause they are too challenging, too loud, too whatever. So they try to gain control and lessen the impact of the \"inevitable\" by pushing their guardians/foster parents/whoever away.\n\nMany of these kids have extremely low self-esteem or even suffer from depression, self-hate, you name it.\n\nThey crave stability, a loving home and a nurturing environment, but at the same time they often believe they don't deserve it or will never be able to have these.\n\nThe only things that help are the help of a professional, much time and stubbornness.\n\nI have a student right now who had a meltdown not too long ago. They screamed and threw stuff at me and cried I should go away. But the thing is, if you go away you show them, that you will also abandon them (in their logic). So you have to be a total PITA until they get it, that you won't drop them, just cause they are challenging at times. This will give them the craved stability to heal.\n\nThis is not your job to do. This is Aria's and Dan's job, if they really want to adopt a kid out of the foster system, especially one with behavioural issues. I also don't know, if Grace has some other diagnosis or unknown stuff, that would also be a factor in her behaviour. Stuff like being mean/cruel towards animals can also be a hint to other stuff, but this is not my job and over my paygrade to diagnose. Again: She should see a professional.\n\n\nSo, you are absolutely no AH for wanting to protect your daughter and her belongings.\n\nBut I am not sure, if your daughter is really 100% innocent, cause I also worked with younger kids (preschool/kindergarten age) and oh boy, these kids can also be really cruel. Just cause they don't 100% understand what they are saying, they still get, that they are pushing the buttons of the other person and hurt them.\n\nMaybe a talk between the girls, with you, your SO, Aria and Dan (for moderation) would help to set some things and especially some rules. The fact, that Grace isn't Aria's and Dan's biological child is clear. But on the other hand this means that she got abandoned/put up for adoption OR she got re-homed by CPS. Both possibilities are pretty traumatic and maybe it would help to say, that she IS (at least at the moment) your daughter's cousin, to show her she is welcome. Cause as long as the adoption papers aren't finalised (which is right now not even in question), she always has this Sword of Damocles over her head, that she could every day get sent back to an orphanage or whatever else until she gets assigned to a new family.", "ESH.

My (at the time) 13 year old daughter was afraid of her. I had a baby with my husband that she tried to kill more than once.\n\nMore mildly than than that she would poop in her clothes dresser and tried to hang the cat. And that was after a year of weekly therapy. (No one will ever convince me that CBT is anything but a bandaid for trauma that is killing your heart.)\n\nPeople would absolutely NOT follow my directive that she never be left alone in a room with another kid. I was a big mean AH for insisting on being on top of her when we were in public or making her leave her bedroom door open at all times except for a timed period she had to change clothes. \n\nI did my best for two years but was getting no support from my husband or the system. \n\nThis and other factors made it so I HAD to leave. My other kids' lives were in danger (no, I am not exaggerating). It may seem ridiculous or make me an asshole. That's finebecause my kids are alive. It used to keep me up at night that things went even more sideways after I left and she ended up in foster care again (then was adopted and then back in care after her adoptive parents couldn't manage her either). Did I abandon a step kid I didn't agree to have in my life before she showed up? Yes. I could not save her and I couldn't risk the lives of my other kids. It was like trying to save a drowning person while carrying other people who can't swim yet either. \n\nThings are probably not this bad in OP's situation, but I am sure that Grace's foster parents aren't getting the help and support they need to do well by her. \n\nOP is NOT the AH.  No one has to set fire to themselves (or their children) to keep someone else warm. \n\nI hope things have improved and there are supports for Dan and Aria.

Did OP  talked with her daughter about her \"cousin\" or soon to be \"cousin\"?   \n\"They are not your parents\" phrase is really hurtful for a child even if it is true. They are not her bio parents but they are her parent figures currently in her life. Being just 8yo traumatized child, she didn't know how to react and the outburst came as breaking things.

That does not mean they should receive inferior treatment, and as  childless aunt  I would have given equal attention and gifts  to a foster child that my siblings fostered, but I could not have said the child was a niece or nephew until they were adopted.  When the foster child is adopted by the aunt and uncle, the child can welcome the 8 year old as a new member of the family, her cousin .

And after they are done pricing their point to me they would go back to all three of them fighting each other.\n\nI do appreciate your edits rolling in, which continue to alter and down play the situation.  The reality is you taught your daughter your niece isn't family. That is on you.\n\nYour daughter is fully capable of understanding the impact and implications of the words YOU admit and acknowledge she said. To be clear this is not the words in Grace's version... But your daughter is also able to understand those words as well.

It is people exactly like you why foster kids are often a mess. They don't feel accepted and even worse their extended foster family constantly rubs it in their face that they don't have family, and importantly that they don't consider them family. It usually is the adults perpetuating those feelings by intentionally creating distance.\n\nHere is a super simple explanation that is inclusive and understandable by toddlers: \"Grace is being taken in by your aunt and uncle because her actual parents couldn't take care of her.

OP admits to not having been prepared for this experience and I feel suspicious that the foster parents weren't either. This calls for some serious education for the family and good establishment of ground rules-- such as, Grace needs to be supervised directly and coached by foster parents at these events, Grace needs support or a safe spot to cool down or escape where there's nothing she can break/destroy easily, the visit would be under x hours, and if Stepsis/her husband isn't supervising and Grace breaks items, they pay for it. \n\nTherapy is really needed here to help these people learn how to be foster parents to Grace.", "Especially since OP says she didn\u2019t know about adoption plans until this fight.", "OP's daughter must have learnt the ''technical truth\" from someone, which probably is one or both of her parents.", "Agree.

All the new people, everyone who are now \"family\" is very difficult for a child to process, especially when they are taken from them. I fully understand the intent behind such actions, but I also know the flip side of those actions. This helps to create the cycle a lot of foster kids get into of attachment disorders.

And I don't think \"aunt Aria gave birth to a 7 year old child\" is going to cut it as an explanation.", "Or maybe she is smart.  \n\nThey started fostering when she was 4 and this is their second foster child. She must understand to some extent that this child might not be around for long (just like the last one) because they are in fact not grace\u2019s & Dan\u2019s\u2026. \n\nSounds like the family was supportive but not at the family\u2019s expense. Once Grace\u2019s behavior and lying stop (with the help of therapy which I hope she\u2019s in) the rule can change. But seems like everyone is about their wits end.\n\nThey aren\u2019t \u201cexcluding\u201d her because she\u2019s a foster child, its due to her behavior which is understandable.", "I also think it\u2019s laughable that OP things her 6 year old doesn\u2019t know how to apply words like stupid and dirty as insults lol", "No, kids are just brutally honest as the several comments above yours pointed out.", "Yup she has had this child as her cousin for two years so someone talks about how she\u2019s not thwir real niece / cousin for her to even know this", "> So OP gets to dismiss the behaviour in her own kid, but not the foster kid? That's awfully one sided.\n\nI'm not sure what behavioral issue you're referring to for OP's child.\n\nAlso, the *recurring* behavior is bad enough that OP's parents and other siblings have similar issues. It's something that has to be addressed rather than just forcing them all to keep putting up with it.", "OP's kid acted pretty much like a 6 year old. They didn't really understand a whole lot. OP also had a talk with her daughter about the issue. So it's not like she dismissed the behavior, she addressed it.", "So I think you're letting being a foster parent colour your judgement a lot here, so I think it's better to put it another way. \n\nIf Grace were a step-cousin and OP's daughter said that Grace wasn't her cousin, the 6 year old wouldn't be lying. She's technically telling the truth. Could the two develop a bond to the point that they became cousins? Absolutely, but at this point, that bond doesn't seem to exist. Kids, especially little ones, can be really literal. Grace's presence was explained by her needing to stay with Aria and Dan because her own parents couldn't care for her. Meanwhile, the daughter's cousins are definitely the children of her aunts and uncles. If no one has explained that Grace might become her cousin and they don't have that bond, I can see why OP's daughter said what she said. It's kid logic, lacking the nuance that you and I understand.\n\nYes, children have poor emotional control, but Grace really seems to be acting out a lot from what OP describes. Even her own foster parent is siding with OP because her behaviour is not acceptable. I would hope that Aria and Dan are getting Grace all the help and support they can, but trauma does not justify or excuse being destructive. \n\nAs for what Grace said, I wonder if it isn't so much that OP's daughter said that as what Grace is hearing at school and what she worries about herself, and OP's daughter seemingly rejecting her as part of the family opened up a huge wound and everything came gushing out. I've known foster kids and their biggest fear once they find a family they like is that they will be sent back. They struggle with feeling unwanted, and because sometimes they come from homes where they've been neglected, they often have been bullied, and once a kid starts being bullied for being dirty, for example, kids will stick with it. \n\nUltimately, there needs to be a real conversation about how to help her. This isn't even about her being a foster kid, as families will avoid poorly behaved biological family members because it becomes too much. Grace needs a lot of help and a lot of support, and that means Aria and Dan need to find therapists and other people who can help her because her behaviour is ultimately only hurting herself. It will be hard for her to settle in with the rest of the family and build bonds when she's acting out and being destructive. I think a time out from the extended family might ultimately benefit her for a while, as she needs time to adjust to her new home (we both know it can take way more than 2 years for a foster kid to settle, especially if there is trauma there, and she's at an age where she has big feelings but doesn't necessarily have the words to describe them, which leads to acting out and becoming destructive to express herself and get her frustration out). Then, once she's doing better, she can be reintroduced to the family a step at a time through playdates etc, so it isn't overwhelming for Grace or the other family members. \n\nOP is NTA, the 6 year old is NTA, and Grace is NTA. Ultimately, the only AHs are Aria and Dan if they haven't been getting Grace help and/or if they do not get her the help she needs going forwards.", "This is their *second placement* in the past two years. She\u2019s been fostered by OP\u2019s sister and BIL for much less than two years if she is the SECOND placement (meaning that she is the second child placed with them, not the first, and not the only in that time frame). And even Dan, the foster dad, agrees with OP on the situation.", "And the age appropriate way is to say she\u2019s living there until she can go back to her mommy and daddy. Not to say \u201cthis is your new cousin\u201d and then the next time she sees her aunt and uncle the child is gone.", "Grace has been there for 1 year not 2 read the post. Op's child didn't say anything until a year of dealing with Grace's shit. She hasn't been trash talking her for 2 years non stop.", "The thing is this was a *violent* emotional outburst, during which Grace deliberately broke multiple things in order to hurt the other girl. That isn't standard 8-year-old behavior. There isn't any indication OP's daughter was being malicious; actually it looks like even *Grace* realizes she wasn't, otherwise why lie about what she said?", "The 6 year old was telling the truth and it wasn\u2019t meant to cause harm.

That's a huge difference.", "One destroyed the property of another and lied to get them in trouble. The difference is that one involved a certain degree of malice.\n \nThe difference is that such bad behavior is a recurring one.\n\nOP's daughter didn't treat the girl like trash. Let's stop with the hyperbole.", "You're an \"unbecoming\" uncle? Maybe learn some manners? /j", "Stop with the bs semantics. You know I didn't mean blood or technically.", "Wtf? lol...reading comprehension shouldn't be that tough. Thanks for adding weird/crazy to this lol...", "What behaviors? Telling the truth? There\u2019s no guarantee Gracie will still be with them a year from now.", "What are you talking about? Gracie is a brat and regardless, her behavior wasn't justified. Gracie has done this before.", "Hey, I dealt with that as a kid. Sobbed until I threw up daily for weeks. Protect your kids from that grief. My aunt insisted that everyone treat them like full family members, so when they were moved, I didn't understand what was happening. My brother, who was 6 at the time, certainly didn't. It was horrible. I'm not saying build emotional walls, but be honest with the kids about what might happen. Fucked me up for years, and I was 10, so better able to understand it than OP's kid.", "Yup. At that age they usually don't do it to hurt. I bet she said it because she was taught \"A cousin is the child of my aunt and uncle\". So if she said that it's because none of the parents explained to her in a good way that Grace might not be biologically, but stiml be part of the family as her aunts and uncles kid.\n\nIt's not the kids fault really but the adults who aren't clear in communicating what Grace's \"status\" in the family is and that she will be her cousin when the uncle and aunt plan to adopt and keep her. I don't think you can expect a 6yo to understand the finer details of blended families and adopted foster kids on her own.", "Probably when they were introduced?\n\n\"Hey this is grace, aunty and uncle are caring for her for a while\" \n\nThat's usually the simplest explanation.", "So you think they should tell her every foster child is her cousin and then let her lose all these cousins when they are no longer being fostered by the aunt and uncle? \n\nNo.  The truth is Grace won\u2019t be her cousin until or unless aunt/uncle officially adopt her.", "A six year old will know when an 8 year old suddenly shows up in the family out of nowhere,  especially when this isn't the first foster child her aunt and uncle have had in their home.", "What are you talking about?

How much/What did she destroy?", "Do you think protecting them from the consequences of their child's actions is going to do anyone in this situation any favours?", "You DO need to burden them with it, truly. They need to learn from this as much as the 8 yo does.", "Ah, well that's great that your daughter  remembers some things better than others. well my cousin was adopted when I was around 4 too. As far as I knew he was always there and we are pretty close in age, around the same age gap as your child and grace and I didn't know he was adopted til we were teenagers. He's still my cousin now not some adopted child of my auntie and uncle but we are a close knit family so no one was treat any different and there is no adopted or foster titles for any of the kids my auntie has had over the years and we are still in contact with most of them. Hopefully you all work things out as she is still a child from a troubled background.", "OP- your daughter is 6. And your stories are starting to have inconsistencies.

She didn\u2019t make a logical connection. She parroted what she heard from you and/or your spouse. Come on. \n\nYou don\u2019t consider Grace family- and you need to reflect on how an eight year old in the foster system would react to that. Kids are not dumb. They can tell when they are unwanted. \n\nAgain, Grace needs therapy. And sounds like Aria needs a course in raising foster kids. \n\nGrace should not have broken your daughter\u2019s play house. She absolutely should suffer consequences for that.

Or they were, because it\u2019s obvious Dan is getting cold feet.", "And being \"family\" doesn't mean that OP's daughter has to be around an abusive liar. \n\nAnd please, don't bother screaming at me that she's 8 and therefor a perfect little angel and probably traumatized, etc etc. Spare me.", "Even more reason she knows she isn\u2019t her biological cousin. Need to up my detail taking-in skills when reading posts!", " Regardless, you have no actual clue how the other kids treat Grace and she was deeply hurt by what your daughter said. Your solution is to ban her from your home because she lacks healthy coping skills. You know she is still learning self regulation and yet you excuse your daughter being cruel to her. Your daughter is a bully and I have zero doubt a 6 year old knows exactly what lice is. Grace told you she was deeply hurt and how she received what was said. It sounds like your family has made every effort to ensure Grace feels unwanted. Well done \ud83d\ude44", "Odd because all of my schooling and training clearly say CBT isn't an appropriate therapy for children.", "Yes but they are going to keep putting this poor child into situations she isn't prepared for, and doing surprised Pikachu face when she acts naturally towards a stressful situation. Why let her be in a small enclosed space with another child? That's usually a very upsetting situation for children who have issues that run this deep. The parents should have been helping her, and when they didn't you should have spoke up to them. You allowed that and risked your daughter's safety. When it's your child and property that's where you need to step in and get the kids back into a situation in which Grace can't cause harm. You also need to talk to your family about how you should and shouldn't act or talk to Grace in order to avoid hurting her even if it's \"the truth\". The things Grace said your daughter said are the things Grace has been told before or is wondering are true about herself. \n\nDo not try to parent Grace, though. They need to. And they need to pay for damage because otherwise they won't intervene enough. They are overwhelmed right now and probably not thinking about how it's adding up, but, tell them now when it's the playhouse and not stuff that is super valuable or can't be replaced that she attacks-- or your child. \n\nI urge you and family to get to family therapy (with just the adults) to sort this out pronto before it causes deeper conflicts and resentment.", "You don't feel right causing them financial problems, but you do feel right about banning a child you who noted is traumatized from family gatherings?  Come on.", "So crazy how many people here want you to bludgeon your relatives with a bill, while you clearly are grappling with complex kinship issues that would not benefit from the addition of unnecessary drama. I don\u2019t have a good idea of what you should do, but you\u2019re handling this with concern and compassion. I hope your family can collaborate on a set up that is supportive of everyone.", "You are handling the money aspect with grace.\n\nYou are handling the whole situation the best you can.  The SIL is not an ah, but does not grasp that Grace isn't socialized enough yet to be left unsupervised.", "Fair enough. Possibly consider mentioning that you are NOT asking them to pay for the broken items (and about what that would cost) next time your SIL complains to you. Then again, thay may do no good. This is a hard situation and I think you're handling it to the best of your abilities.", "What about handing them an Itemized statement with the replacement costs. Not as a bill, but to make them aware of how much damage she caused. Maybe once the start seeing the actuals figures they may realize what is really going on", "Lice is not a hygiene issue, in fact lice prefer clean hair.\n\nLice is incredible common because of the way children play in close contact.\n\nDon't want you or anyone else reading this post to make that assumption when a child they know gets lice.", " Op said the exclusion is making the bil reticent not that he was never on board but whatever. Foster child bad go back to where she comes from because she\u2019s a dangerous menace", "Your priorities are screwed up. No, things shouldn't be damaged. No, your child shouldn't have been cruel. But you are only willing to give one kid a pass here.", "Uhhh I freaking love this, it\u2019s very sweet, and I\u2019ll be using this because mine does the exact same thing.", "Yeah when my daughter was little she squeezed my tummy and said I was squishy.

Op is an adult. Grace was wrong to break things but she is a literal child with most likely severe trauma. Also it\u2019s obvious that Grace is not treated equally with the other kids based on the request from the grandparents.", "also OPs edit explains what grace actually said the daughter said which was much more extensive and complicated than just those single words\u2026it\u2019s believable that the 6 year old didn\u2019t  have the band width to say what grace claims.", "Kids are brutally honest at times. But the fact she even said \"you arnt their kid\" means that was told to her somewhere. And wasn't told otherwise. No conversation of \"she is their kid, blood or not\" is sad. \n\nCause that had to hurt, even knowing your adopted having someone say \"you arnt really their kid\" fucking hurts, and the fact op just passes that off as nothing is depressing.", "Where did op mention how they addressed it with their daughter? Op seems to feel that their daughter did nothing wrong.", "This wasn't a first meeting. OP stated that Grace had been in the family for nearly a year...", "This is not a first meeting. They have been fostering Grace for a year.", "No, you just said it badly.", "Why did they have to accept her, but OP's kid doesn't have to accept this kid?

Gracie shouldn\u2019t be in their home until she can keep herself from destroying things and not tell lies about OP\u2019s daughter.", "I did not ban her from family gatherings. I banned her from my home, because of property damage (on this and previous occasions), and cruelty to my animals, and my child.\n\nMy parents and stepbrother have blown it into a family gatherings thing.", "Fair enough. Either way, my daughter had lice at 3, I doubt she remembers what head lice even are. I know I\u2019ve tried to forget.", "If the foster father was ever on board, he would have backed his wife. He did not. The child is dangerous, I was in foster care with kids like her. They should never be placed with families, they need intense therapy before they can be placed. Due to shortages of families, staff, medical professionals, beds, etc., those kids are put into foster homes where they do not get the adequate treatment. It never turn out well.", "Why? She knew there was another kid who was there and then not. A 6 year old, while not understanding what foster care is and how it works, can absolutely understand that this maybe isn't permanent.\n\nAlso given what the rest of the family feels who knows what she's heard.", "The girl is 6. Grace has been \"in the family\" for 1 year. There was a previous foster placement before that. (which complicates the narrative of \"now you're here, you're family.\")  The kid can figure out for herself that Grace isn't her aunt and uncle's bio kid and hasn't been around the whole time. \n\nIt does sound like a very hurtful thing for Grace to hear though. I don't think it's possible to tell from OP's account whether this was an innocent \"kid truth\" moment or a hurtful takedown. I've see both from six year olds (I work at a school. I know a lot of six year olds.) OP is unlikely to be an objective narrator either.", "Yeah, it's wild to see \"NTA\" concerning an adult and an eight year old child. Not to say that Grace is acting perfectly, but she is *eight* years old. \n\nWhy are you on AITA and not some kind of support/advice group.", "But she's not their kid and she's not adopted. she's just placed in their home. Not all foster kids are even eligible for adoption. Many go back to their bio parents. Or this girl may end up adopted by someone else. No one knows the future.", "Really? Because it has 40 up votes. It seems that you're the one struggling here little fella.", "lol..OK troll, moving on.", "I don't believe she lied. I believe that she told OP how what her daughter said was perceived by her. I also don't believe her daughter didn't say the things she was told, especially since OP changed what Grace said in her edit.", "Frankly, from other comments about your child's lack of \"tact\", it seems clearly that the cruelty isn't only on one side. However, you aren't willing to see that.", "Because Grace isn't OP's child and it's not incumbent upon her to do research into dealing with a traumatized foster child. That's the foster parents' job. \n\nShe wants to know if she's the AH for refusing to let the step-sister's foster child visit because that's how her sister is portraying her. The dispute is between the sisters and the child is simply the catalyst for the dispute. The judgement isn't that the child is the AH; the judgement is that the sister is AH for insisting people tolerate her foster child's destructive behavior.", "Exactly this. I have had a varied career in social services, working in child welfare, courts, school, youth jails, social welfare offices... To me, when it comes to an eight year old disenfranchised CHILD, if you have to even ask if you're TA, you're coming from a place of impeccable priveledge.", "I in fact do not base my personal judgement on redditor upvotes and downvotes.
