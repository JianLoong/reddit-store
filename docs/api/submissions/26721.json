{"id": 26721, "submission_id": "16gvhhg", "title": "AITA for banning my stepsister\u2019s foster daughter from my house?", "selftext": "My (31F) stepsister \u201cAria\u201d (33F) has been fostering a girl called \u201cGrace\u201d (8F) for about a year. Aria and her husband \u201cDan\u201d have been fostering with the view of someday adopting for 2 years, a decision they made when they found out Aria couldn\u2019t have biological kids. Grace is their second placement. \n\nGrace has behaviour problems, and we knew this in advance because Aria mentioned it but honestly I wasn\u2019t exactly prepared. Tantrums, bullying the other children, bad language, mean to the pets at home, possessive behaviour, you name it, Grace has exhibited it. I know this can be the case with traumatised kids so we\u2019ve tried to let a lot of things slide as Aira and Dan tried to help Grace adjust, but it\u2019s been hard and unpleasant. We\u2019re a close knit family so our parents, siblings and families get together most weekends, but me and our other siblings have begun to dread these encounters because it seems like we never have one event without Grace creating an issue. Even my parents have been getting fed up.\n\nThe final straw for me was last weekend. My husband and I hosted a family barbecue at our place. My daughter (6) and Grace were playing in my daughter\u2019s playhouse until she came out upset. It turned out Grace had broken a bunch of things in the playhouse. When asked what had caused the outburst, Grace burst into tears and accused my daughter of bullying her, calling her dirty, unwanted, stupid, poor, and all sort of things which are all a lie. My daughter is six, she doesn\u2019t have enough understanding of why those words would hurt Grace in order to use them. My daughter\u2019s version of events is that Grace said something about the girls being cousins and my daughter said Grace isn\u2019t her cousin because she\u2019s not Aria and Dan\u2019s child. I can understand how this would Upset Grace but it\u2019s a totally different story that the one she told and no amount of hurt could excuse the destruction she caused. \n\nI said to Aria and Dan that I wouldn\u2019t allow Grace to visit anymore. That means someone else will have to host holidays, and we will make a decision on an ad hoc basis whether we will attend (my daughter is very upset about what happened and understandably doesn\u2019t want to see Grace for a while). This has led to our parents saying it\u2019s not fair that they miss out seeing their granddaughter, and that since Grace is the one who behaved poorly, Aria and Dan should bow out of future events. \n\nAria is saying that I am evil for forcing the rest of the family to ostracise a traumatised child, and that I need to take this all back. Dan on the other hand, is siding with me and the parents. Aria has also said this is causing issues since they were looking into adopting Grace but this whole issue has made Dan reticent since obviously they won\u2019t be adopting her with the full support of the family. Aria is saying I\u2019m essentially denying Grace a family, but I feel like I\u2019m just trying to protect mine.

Until Gracie has had enough professional therapy she shouldnt be given free reign to everyone and everything. Your daughter is far too young to be able to defend herself from those attacks. You are responsible for protecting your kid, thats what you're doing.", "NTA - Aria and Dan should be required to have better supervision of Grace at family gatherings.", "NTA. It's not for you to fix. Yes, it's awful Grace is traumatized, but it doesn't make it ok for her to hurt your own daughter. Aria and Dan need to grow up and be the adults. She can't learn that she will get whatever she wants in life by throwing tantrums and people just listen because they feel sorry for her. I think you did well by setting a boundary, and Aria is acting like a child because you aren't letting her and Grace get what they want, anymore. Adopted, Fostered, or Bio- children need guidance. Aria and Dan aren't guiding her. They're just putting up with her.", "NTA.  Dan and Aria need to be more than involved parents since this is a known problem.  Helicopter parents are usually bad, but here they are a necessity.  It gets hosted elsewhere and Dan and Aria step up.", "NTA.  They can't just dump the kid into a large gathering and expect everything to go fine.  They needed to be active and involved and on top of supervision during these meetings and it sounds like they're just expecting the rest of the family to deal with it instead.", "NTA, You aren't responsible for Aria and Dan's inability to cope with Grace's behavior. Your post also reads as though they are enabling the behavior as one (or both) is clearly desperate for child.\n\nIt's right that they stand back at least for the short term, until Grace settles and they all start some kind of family therapy.", "NTA- if it was just the one incident I'd say this was an overreaction, because I could totally get why Grace would be upset at being told she isn't Dan and Aria's child, even if  your daughter doesn't really understand why that would be hurtful. Obviously breaking things is not a good reaction, but again it could be understandable due to her background. However, given that this is part of a larger pattern of behavior I think it's fair to not allow grace over anymore unless Dan and Aria actually start taking responsibility for her behavior and ensuring that if something starts to happen they intervene immediately. Her behavior may be understandable due to past trauma, but that doesn't make it okay for her to bully other children, hurt or be mean or animals, and break things when she's upset. I feel sorry for Grace, but Dan and Aria don't sound like they doing enough to address this behavior. They know she has these issues and they need to be proactive in preventing them, and addressing them appropriately if they do occur. It's not fair to the other kids or the rest of the family that she's basically allowed to do whatever she wants even if it hurts other. It sounds like grace needs foster parents experienced with these kind of behavioral issues. It's not easy to raise a kid while also being a therapist, a doctor, a referee, and often times a punching bag (mentally and physically ). It takes a very specific type of person to fulfill those roles while also teaching the child better coping mechanisms and ensuring they are not treated as a burden or a problem.", "NTA. Its been a year with what seems to be no improvement behavior-wise. You have the right to protect your family and property. Aria and Dan need to focus on getting Grace appropriate professional care (if they're not doing thst already) and looking into parenting classes for themselves.\n\nTbh, I think Dan was already on the fence about adopting Grace before this latest incident. He probably used the ban to start a conversation about their suitability as a long-term placement for Grace.", "Dealing with trauma can take a lot of time and some parents deal with it better than others. Grace should be having regular counseling sessions, as should Aria and Dan have meetings with a child psychologist and social worker about how best to deal with such outbursts.\n\nLets think of the Michael Vicks dogs - they all faced horrific situations, yet, some could be placed almost immediately, some needed work, maybe years, before they could be placed in new homes, while some had to stay with the dog experts for life because they could never safely adapt to life outside their caregiving facility. \n\nFoster kids are somewhat the same. Some are remarkably adaptable, some need work and can get there, some are really beyond anything but an experts level of care - but that really doesn't exist in the foster care system.\n\nNTA, because your job is to protect your daughter from harm.", "I wanted to vote E S H because the fact that you allowed her to play unsupervised with your daughter knowing she displays \n\n> behaviour problems, ... Tantrums, bullying the other children, bad language, mean to the pets at home, possessive behaviour, you name it, Grace has exhibited it\n\nHowever  your question is regarding whether you have a right to now allow her in your home. So I will vote NTA", "Not the AH. You are responsible for the safety and wellbeing of your child despite the feelings and motivations of others, be they family or whoever. Period. Dealing with a traumatized child is difficult, but that responsibility belongs to Aria and Dan, not you.  Grace should not be excluded from ALL family gatherings and the ones she does attend, Dan and Aria need to keep her close and keep an eye on her at all times.  If Grace is going to be adopted, it\u2019s going to take a whole family approach.", "ESH. Y'all know that Grace is prone to bullying, tantrums, and bad language, yet you allowed her to hang out alone with your 6yo daughter in the playhouse, where she managed to destroy a bunch of stuff without anyone noticing? What were the adults in the family doing?", "NTA - As a survivor of significant childhood trauma, I can tell you that having lived through it doesn't automatically result in the behaviors you are talking about. \n\nGiven her pattern of troubling actions - most expressly being mean to the pets - it's possible there is other pathology accompanying whatever situational difficulties she has endured. \n\nYou have every right to set boundaries for yourself and your household. It seems to me that doing so is the only way to protect yourselves. \n\nIs your sister getting Grace any help? Is she in therapy? These behaviors aren't just going to magically resolve themselves by being removed from the trauma that contributed to them. She will need to learn new and healthy coping mechanisms before she can be expected to improve.", "NTA. You have been supportive over the past roughly a year span. Now things have continued as seems to have escalated and you have to ensure to support and protect your child/family. Hard truths are not easy to hear or accept and it seems that Dan had his eyes open to something and if he is agreeing partially with you this helps you know you are in the right.", "NTA \n\nkeep her violence away from your child", "NTA it sucks that Grace is lashing out and needs help, but that help can\u2019t come at the expense of your whole family\u2019s peace.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No. However, Grace most likely feels dirty, poor, stupid, and UNWANTED. Now you want to exclude her from family events. \n\nWhat are Aria and Dan doing to curtail these occurrences? Are they watching her closely? I assume they are all in therapy to learn how to deal with her feelings.", "ESH. Aria and Dan need to get Grace behavioral help and until she makes progress, she shouldn\u2019t be playing with a smaller kid unsupervised. \n\nYou complain about Grace\u2019s behavior but didn\u2019t keep an eye on your own kid either, and now you want to exclude Grace instead of making her parents take responsibility for watching her.

Of course you have a duty to keep your daughter safe, but some compassion for an emotionally damaged child isn\u2019t out of line here.", "More info:  How is it that your daughter doesn't understand the words dirty, poor, and unwanted, but does understand the difference between biological, adopted, and foster children?  Leaning toward YTA because it seems like your daughter overheard you and/or other adults talking and repeated what she said - or worse you have out right told her that Grace is not her cousin.  Of course this doesn't mean that Grace should be allowed to break things or harm pets.  If the family were kind and welcoming, you could make events more enjoyable for everyone by getting all of the adults to agree to more structure and supervision when Grace is around.

This might pile on to Grace\u2019s existing trauma and while you should protect your daughter, Grace also needs to be nurtured and protected. What been done to address the issues?

We didn\u2019t use the word foster, or adopted. But she knows what a cousin is because she has cousins. \n\nWe are a blended family, we\u2019re not big on \u201cblood\u201d, so it\u2019s not true we view adopted kids as less important.\n\nETA: We have never and *would never* use that language about Grace.", "So how do they suck?", "Not everyone can handle a traumatized child. It doesn't reflect poorly on them, as long as they weren't the ones inflicting the trauma.", "Her daughter is 6. What she said is how she understands the situation. Given that adoption is not always guaranteed when a couple fosters a child it would be a bad idea to tell OP\u2019s daughter that this new girl is her cousin and her aunt & uncle\u2019s child right off the bat. A better idea is telling her that Gracie will be her cousin if her aunt & uncle adopt Gracie.", "Honestly a 6 year old shouldn't be set up to fail. As she understands it right now they're not cousins because shes not the aunt and uncle's kid yet. Honestly NOT telling her that they are cousins is for the best until an adoption is finalized.... if the girl was placed elsewhere i would expect it to be a far harder conversation to tell a 6 year old that the girl is no longer family, no longer her cousin rather than waiting and saying shes officially adopted. (Dont know if i explained that well enough).", "Her daughter, who is six, simply said that they weren't cousins.", "The one thing OP\u2019s daughter said. Which is that they weren\u2019t cousins. Which is a pretty reasonable reflection of 6 yr olds understanding of fostering. \n\nThe goal almost all the time is to reunify the child with their biological family. Which OP\u2019s daughter has seen once before. \n\nBut yes, castigate the six year old for not understanding the nuance of foster care that most adults don\u2019t understand.", "She didn't say \"things\". She only said they are not cousins. Neither me nor you know wether she meant it as a slight against Grace. At 6 I am inclined to believe it wasn't and that she just genuinely didn't see anything mean in it, just thought she would have to be their bio daughter to be her cousin. And tbf she was right. As long as Grace isn't adopted she is not her cousin. I see how this would hurt the foster child but it does not excuse her behaviour and lies, claiming the other kid called her all those clear insults.", "Sounds like your parents are as they are saying specifically that aria is their grandchild so Grace needs to be left out of family events", "Both sets of parents suck for allowing the kids to play without supervision.", "Ok but WHO told OP\u2019s daughter that the girls were not cousins? Someone made it a point to do that, a six year old isn\u2019t going to know the difference.", "You learn the family words and ties pretty early. Grandpa, grandma, aunt, brother, sister - this is all things you learn way before you are 6 years old and going to school.", "Yes they are. Six-year olds are not stupid. They know that children don\u2019t magically appear from nothing. She experienced that her aunt and uncle fostered one child and now another.\n\nWhy must children accept arbitrary and mandatory family members? Of course the girls aren\u2019t cousins. If Grace were adopted, it would be another thing, but she is not."]}
