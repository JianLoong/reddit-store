Let him figure it out!!", "NTA, and your daughters gonna thank you later.", "NTA, and your daughters gonna thank you later.", "To continue to help him would be enabling.", "INFO: ages? kicking out a 14 year old isn't the same as kicking out a 35 year old.", "NTA\n\nTwo thoughts.\n\nFirst, someone looking for money/support will review their options from most convenient to least convenient. When you're asked by someone in a hard position, it may feel like you're the difference between their chance to succeed and their chance to fail. But you're really just the next stop on the list...there was an easier one before you and there will be a harder one after you.\n\nSecond, \"What appears to be a crisis is often the end of the illusion that things were working.\" It's rare that someone is actually in a situation where they were OK before and they'll be OK after, if they can just resolve one immediate issue.", "NTA, that is YOUR home/safe space, and you have a right to choose who gets to come into that space, no matter the reason. not to mention you probably just saved your daughter from years (and yes, people like that do stay for as loooong as you let them) of being taken advantage of.", "NTA, FAFO. It's just that simple. He fooled around. He found out. And bravo for that. Maybe next time, with others, he will have some damned sense.", "NTA Has Society gone so crazy that you have to question whether or not  you're the AH for kicking out a lowlife freeloader?", "NTA, takin\u2019 out the trash is just another one of our chores.", "No WTF, he's not your responsibility. My God what generous, understanding, SUPPORTIVE parents you are!\n\nHe's a bum. Now literally, but that's not your problem.\n\nYou saved your daughter's life, I'm not even exaggerating. What if she'd had a kid with him?? The whole rest of her life tied to this loser. I hope she's grateful but if not, oh well, you're still a fucking HERO. \n\nNTA^infinity", "NTA. Fuck, I wish my family would have kicked out my sisters boyfriend. He\u2019s been leeching off my dad, abusing my sister, and now she\u2019s pregnant and he\u2019s being terrible to her still. You may well have just avoided this nightmare scenario. Good for you, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t easy dealing with that confrontation.", "NTA\n\nYou have no responsibility for him. There is a reason his 'real' family doesn't want him and now he managed to piss off his soon to be ex-gf's family too. I'd say he is the reason why all those relationships deterioated. How is your daugther dealing with the situation?", "Not only are you NTA but you\u2019ve hopefully saved your daughter from making a huge mistake.", "NTA. You did good protecting your daughter. Keep this deadbeat out.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You\u2019re protecting your daughter & home by doing this. Don\u2019t feel guilty for getting rid of a lying freeloader.", "NTA stop enabling.", "NTA. You threw a leech out.", "Nta", "NTA.\n\nFuck no, you\u2019re not the arsehole.", "NTA", "NTA", "Nope. His family was on to something. I hope you see that now. These deadbeats will drain you dry and always have some sob story about how the world is against them. Guess what kiddo. Its against everyone. Instead of sitting around doing nothing but winning about it. Make something of yourself because no on is going to do it for you. Unless your family is rich that is.", "Nope.", "Personally, I wouldn\u2019t have given him 9 months if he couldn\u2019t hold onto a job. NTA!", "Um, you moved a random guy into your house after your daughter was dating him for only three months? You're NTA, but you are kind of an idiot. Don't let loser weirdos you barely know move into your house", "NTA. He went from loving/liking the people in the house to using them to his own benefits. It was deserved and he needed that reality check.", "NTA, he had his chance, more than 1 by the sounds of it, if he isn't going to help himself that's his problem, not yours.", "Look, theres a reason people don't even want him staying there. You're NTA he's the AH for refusing to look inward.", "NTA", "Usually when the biological parents have given up on their child it is a major huge red flag that the kid will be trouble.", "Yeah. Additionally his biological family abandoned him and the places he has stayed want him out? It takes a lot of do that. How old is this guy? Sounds like he's either had a rough upbringing and needs some serious counselling. That or he's a bum. Either way still NTA. Your daughter comes first and he crossed boundaries. \n\nMy BIL had huge issues with his parents. He lived with my family from the age of 15-23 until they (he and my sister) were married. He did his best in school, held down a job as a dish pig and respected the rules e.g. sleeping in a separate room from his GF. He helped around the home with chores and cooked occasionally. Never had any problems. But I'm sure *if* he took my sister for an absolute ride emotionally/financially he would have been out on the streets.", "Yep - you can\u2019t help someone who doesn\u2019t want to help themself. Even if he was deceitful and played his role by being helpful, holding down a job and then left, he at least worked towards something. Instead he shitted all over their generosity and fucked himself. NTA and there\u2019s a reason, I\u2019m sure, why his family wants no part of him. And make sure you tell your daughter to value herself more and you won\u2019t let any future boyfriends move in. SO\u2019s are supposed to be partners, not fixer uppers.", "9 months is almost saint levels of patience, especially with someone who you aren't related to but are supporting completely", "He\u2019s a hobosexual", "Why do you hate the French?!", "As this is a decision he should not take lightly..", "Ugh, yes. My friends brother had his girlfriend living with them for years now, he works and she has never held a job, she sits at home playing Sims and as soon as he gets home she's yelling at him for something and even punches him. Their mom just let it happen. More parents need to be like OP for their kids.", "Your parents aren't doing either of them a favor sounds like they need to be pushed out of the nest!!", ">maybe now he\u2019ll learn to work harder\n\nNah, guys like him will play the victim to anyone who will listen. Everyone else who expected him to be a contributing member of society is the problem, not him. \n\nThen, when he finds someone else to sucker into free room and board, the cycle will continue.", "My guess is early 20\u2019s and he\u2019s lazy.", "Good job for standing firm with him.   You\u2019re doing him a huge favor. \n\nI know a ~43 year old who has lived with his parents for the past several years and not only doesn\u2019t he pay rent; but they pay him for his car insurance, gas money, cel phone bill, and every other expense.   And he has no plan for when they eventually pass away.   Sooner or later reality will come crashing down on him.   I wish his parents would do him the same favor you\u2019re doing this guy.", "Any of us that are capable of feeling even the slightest bit of healthy shame will never be able to truly understand how people of this nature operate.", "Who cares? He needed to be gone. Immediately.", "That's ridiculous, would you volunteer to take him in if he were? They don't owe him anything", "No, legally he should have given notice. Ethically he's fine. It's not morally wrong to kick out a freeloader with no business being in your house. What the guy does after that is not ops problem.", "Nah F that. He\u2019s had 9 months to hold down a job. Time to go. See ya. NTA.", "it more so sounds like his bio family aren\u2019t very good people and that he probably had a rough life and needs therapy. he isn\u2019t taking care of himself, obviously\n\nedit: pronoun change", "Needs counseling? The dudes a free loader, who wants to break up because he has to lift a finger and do things. Pretty obvious why his family might\u2019ve kicked this winner out.", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Nah, he doesn't need counselling, just a reality check. He needs to learn that nothing in life is for free and the fact that he thought his girlfriend was bullying him into doing chores just shows that.", "I\u2019m glad the daughter did not got pregnant. He would have bully her", "Laughing", "I like my son's gf but if I ever found out she hit him I would be going to jail. Let alone in my house, omg no.", "Hobosexual", "Well, the law might actually care if he tried to claim unjust eviction. He already left, so she\u2019s lucky, but you would be surprised how hard it can be to evict someone who doesn\u2019t want to leave if you allowed them to occupy your residence without a tenancy agreement for even a few months let alone nine, and his alternative is literally homelessness.", "From a legal standpoint, if they didn't give him notice and he lived there for 9 months, he had residential rights and my vote would be ESH. \n\nIf they DID give him notice, which is the Law everywhere for someone who has an over 6 month residence, then my vote would be NTA. \n\nI agree he needed to be gone asap, but if they didn't follow the law, they're not in the clear. So my vote depends on their answer to my question.", "Yeah. Jerks can benefit from counseling too, I don\u2019t know why that\u2019s difficult to understand?", "Right? Everyone brushes it off because \"she has depression\", but it makes me sick. That's no excuse to me, I used to hang out there but I stopped going around when I heard her punching him in the head in the other room and no one did anything (and stopped me when I stood up). I'm pregnant with my first son but I'll never let anyone lay a hand on him, man or woman.", "You can break the law but still not be an asshole \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Still NTA even if they did \u201cbreak the law\u201d. He was using and mooching off their daughter. Not kicking him out immediately would be an asshole move to their daughter who obviously works hard and does what she needs to do.", "But who\u2019s paying for that? He has no money, no job, and I\u2019m assuming no insurance.", "Exactly.  Do not conflate legality and morality -- they are NOT the same thing.", "[removed]", "They said he needs counseling, not that he needs someone to get him counseling. He\u2019s responsible for his own mental health at the end of the day.", "You are aware that it's possible to need something you can't afford or access, right?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
