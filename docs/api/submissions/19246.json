He could have been honest and asked to stay a few more months while he saved up. He could have kept his month shut and just quietly prepared and then left. He chose neither.

Or did you just boot him to the curb same day?", "idk how people can live like this without feeling extremely embarrassed lmfao", "INFO - how old is he and does he have any circumstance that make him a vulnerable human (disabilities or impairments). \n\nMy judgement depends on this.

Sounds like this boyfriend sucks so let's focus on how you handled it, OP. \n\n1) If evicting someone from their domicile will make them homeless, especially if they're quite young, they deserve advance notice. A couple of weeks or a month. Not just \"He knew the rules,\" but \"Hey, kiddo, you have two weeks and there is no argument here, so use them well.\" \n\n2) If your daughter is old enough to have a live-in boyfriend, she's probably old enough to be involved in the conversation about how to treat the boyfriend. I am \\*not\\* saying the daughter gets to dictate how you run your house, but it sounds like you didn't consult her or ask for her thoughts.", "What are YOUR DAUGHTER's wishes in this?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYTA for not even considering that.", "mild ESH. He didn't follow your rules for staying, so it's fine that you kicked him out. However, your post doesn't mention helping him find accommodation or giving him any time to line something up. \n\nIf he stayed with you 9 months he most likely has legal rights as a tenant and you kicked him out illegally; he could sue you if he knew to do so.

You might be referring to squatters rights, but he hasn't been there long enough for that. Also, the owners of the house were and still are living there.

Tenant's rights are about legally residing in someone else's property.", "He is an asshole too, but I'm speaking legally. He is a legal tenant, and he deserved the minimum protections provided to him by law. \"Not illegal\" is the lowest possible moral standard.\n\nThese laws were made with OP's situation in mind: when a property owner throws out a stay at home partner without notice, rendering them homeless.", "And he's gone now, so any tenet status is also gone.
