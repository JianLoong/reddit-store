Also actively worked while homeless and suffering. It\u2019s lazy to me either way. He has the energy to play games and accuse his girlfriend of abuse, he has the energy to go find a job or at the least apply for disability if it\u2019s so bad he can\u2019t work. He moved in under the condition that he\u2019ll help out with rent and chores. He didn\u2019t. If something was *actually* wrong he can speak up and ask for help. \n\nNot making any effort at all whatsoever is simply just laziness and not wanting help.", "Lazy is the answer when those above aren\u2019t confirmed and those above are used as the excuse. You can have all of these but wanting nothing better for yourself is lazy", "Tenant status is still with him until he is legally evicted. \n\nIt would make no sense for your landlord to be able to change the locks on you one day and then say \"well, he's not sleeping here anymore! He's no longer a tenant!\".", "... hobosexual?", "But you have to want to change and be better for that to happen. If he were to get therapy, he would most likely try to lie to, manipulate, and dismiss the therapist for his own benefit. Therapy only works if the person wants it.", "he needs to wise the fuck up or watch it falls.", "It seems like a lot of people in these replies are taking \u201che needs counseling\u201d to mean \u201cawww poor widdle guy is probably just traumatized or something, it\u2019s not his fault, he can\u2019t help it, he must have a sad backstory \ud83e\udd7a\u201d which I highly doubt is what the commenter above was saying. \n\nIt\u2019s not about sympathizing with him or coddling him or trying to absolve him of responsibility. It\u2019s acknowledging that he seems maladjusted in some way and that there\u2019s a chance to find ways to address those maladjustments and possibly have him become a better-functioning member of his community and society. Which is not, of course, OP\u2019s responsibility. Just an observation regarding the situation.", "I dunno, I kind of think counseling only helps if you want the help. Maybe for a small portion of people, having a licensed and qualified stranger tell you that YOU are the problem might knock some sense into them, but it seems like that would still be a small subset. I am unfortunately in the (outer, thankfully) orbit of someone who is in court-mandated counseling, and despite the consequences of not \"doing well\" in this counseling being pretty dire (they probably won't end up in jail unless they also do other stuff, but their life will suck), their response to it is that their counselors are idiots (they've been through 4 now) and the therapists just don't see how they are doing everything right and being abused at every turn.", "I have major depressive disorder and have since I was a teenager. \n\nCall it whatever you will, maybe it's dysfunctional to a degree but my mom expected me to do well in school and be a self sufficient person and I don't think there's really any other option.   Is it kind of mean to be like \"sorry you're sad but get a job\"? Kind of, but it's real. That's life.\n\nMy cousin is my age and similarly batty as me, but she uses it as an EXCUSE and she's a loser. I tried being her friend and helping her (at her request) but she ALWAYS had an excuse for why she couldn't do even the smallest thing to help herself--or her freaking KID. Thank God his dad wasn't cut from that cloth and he has raised him, she's completely absent at this point I think. \n\nI can kms or I can live, and living takes work. Am I still depressed? YES. But mooching off someone else isn't an option I can live with. That's just gross. \n\nCongrats on your pregnancy! It's really hard when they're infants, but don't wish that time away because it'll be over before you know it. Mine just finished high school and it feels like just a few years ago he was a toddler. Time flies faster and faster as you get older. Cliche but true.", "I have depression. Sometimes I am extremely depressed. Sometimes, as a result of my depression, I have the urge to lash out at other people. (Verbally, not physically.) I don't do it, because even when I am depressed I know that is not a good thing to do. Depression is no excuse.", "Omg no, this is abuse not depression. I have depression and M.E I cannot hold down a job. I lived with my husbands family for 18 months whilst we were saving to buy our house, he went out to work everyday I stayed at his family home cleaning most of the day, keeping the dogs entertained and doing literally anything I could do each and every day to make their lives easier when they all got home from work. I felt like such a burden.", "That was my point too.", "They didn't change the locks.  They told him to leave and he left.  If he was a tenet, he complied with the eviction, took his stuff presumably.  It's done.", "Someone that stays with their partner for the living quarters.", "Not being able to afford it has nothing to do with whether or not he needs it, which he does", "Realistically, the state probably would. Just needs to get off his ass and put things in motion, which won't happen unless he's out of options.", "That\u2019s a lotta assumptions based off of an anonymous story on the internet. And if that\u2019s true, that has zero affect on whether he\u2019d need some therapy. There are a variety of therapists out there, and it\u2019s not impossible for one of them to get through to him. Unlikely? Sure.", "Yeah.  I think you are right in most cases.  But sometimes people are just so frustrated by falling on their face that they will at least be open to hearing another option.  And I think sometimes there\u2019s an element of empirically demonstrating that there is a better way.  I think one of the best ways is if the counselor makes a personal connection and gains the person\u2019s trust.  But trying it is the first step.  If it doesn\u2019t click, I guess you go from there.  That\u2019s just my impression as someone who benefits personally from it.", "Very well said!\n\nI really enjoyed reading your comment.", "In most of the US, there is no way to legally evict a tenant without giving them notice in writing. Of course laws and specifics vary from region to region so the specifics depend on where OP lives. \n\nChanging the locks is just one way to kick a tenant out. OP was pretty clear that he left involuntarily without notice so he most likely has a case.", "Nta. He was using your daughter for a place to stay. He's had plenty of time to pull himself together and chose not to. He's not your responsibility", "If he\u2019s in the US and especially if he\u2019s young, with no income then he qualifies for no cost health insurance. And there are usually free resources for counseling, might not be great therapists and likely not frequent enough, but they are available. He just has to want to do the work and it may be years before he hits bottom and avails himself.", "No, that's just how it works. To become a better person, the willingness has to be there. You can't force someone to change.", "But he's very unlikely to even have tenet status.  If he didn't have his own room with a lock on it, he likely wouldn't be considered a tenet in most places.  And he left voluntarily, not as the end of a tenancy, but because his host (not landlord) asked him to leave.  He wasn't locked out or forced out by law enforcement.  He wasn't evicted.  \n\nIt would be interesting to know what would happen if he went to court, but we all know that he's not going to do that.", "Not being able to afford it *or* not being open to it both don\u2019t change the fact that he probably needs it, whether he wants it or not. Nobody\u2019s talking about the likelihood of him actually going through with getting help and taking it seriously, just stating that it sounds like counseling *would* theoretically help him."]}
