NTA.\n\nAlso: If your sister wants a kitten, there's a nonzero chance she won't be able to get *a* kitten. Around here, the shelters won't give out solo kittens unless there's already a cat in the house, for the quite sensible reason that kittens do better with other cats. Cats are social animals! You might want to give her a head's up that if she wants just *one* cat she should consider an adult cat who is used to being the only cat in the house. Because if your nephew tells her, she might get annoyed again.", "My boss and I have an understanding - he doesn't demand anything of me and,  in return, I do everything he wants \n without him asking.
