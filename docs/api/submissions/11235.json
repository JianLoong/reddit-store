That's why different cultures have different names even when they live in the u.s proud people who are Hispanic typically give their children names associated with that culture.  As is the case here. It's the same for every culture. Maybe the mom is some generational Christian and that's been her family's culture for a hundred years. Is that less valid? Is the Hispanic person wanting their child to have a Hispanic name and the family look a racist? No they aren't. Of course they aren't. If the mom if every other instance is very loving and involved with the other side of the family then there is a decent chance that maybe they see their daughter throwing away the culture and traditions she was raised with and replaced them with her husband's and was getting upset about that.

In this case I think people are taking the white part of a more white name too literally rather than how many people end up using white to mean anglo Saxon or basically anything northern European. The sentence the mother could be equated to \"The least you could\u2019ve done is given him a more anglicized, German, French, etc name.

We don't choose our coworkers, but we also don't face as much pressure to tell them everything and invite them to our baby showers or whatever.
