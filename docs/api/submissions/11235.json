Sure, you will get some characteristics from the other parent. But your mom is being delusional if she expected your son to come out lily white :) So, then she starts harping about his name?

Why not say that what she said sounded racist, rather than calling her a racist.  I find it's always best to talk about the behavior, not the person.

Always do that when warranted.  \n\nUsing the judgmental comment about \\*her\\* got you the reaction you should have expected.  If you wanted behavior to change (rather than just defensiveness and, possibly, resentment), focussing on the comments, their hurtfulness to you and your children would be more productive.\n\nI am well aware that it is currently common (and among many, accepted) to judge the person (narcissist, toxic, racist, etc.) and not the behavior.  I also know what this sub is called.  FWIW.  This will get me downvotes, but my hope is that my reaction will help focus on a trend I find will only divide, and not educate.\n\nNot to mention, this commentary should not have been \\*ignored.\\*  That it was permitted to go on as long as it did led to \\*snapping\\* and judgment.  Getting in there earlier may have nipped it in the bud before it got as bad as it did, causing you to act in a way that problem hasn't helped.\n\nYour judgment (the one I am giving) is not nearly as strong as the one I have for the commentary of the mother, though I should state that you asked for the judgment, and she didn't.  \n\nSorry for the length.", "YTA\n\nI think you overreacted a bit.
