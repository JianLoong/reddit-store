Really pile it on, and when she doesn\u2019t choose wisely, then you do not celebrate, nor do you try to make her feel better about her bad choice.

However, both of you are going about this completey the wrong way. It's not fair to make you responsible for he diet and weight. That's not your job and evidently, it will build resentment. Most weight gain/loss stems from mental health problems and/or poor relationships with food. Forcing her to work out simply isn't the answer because it will never get to the root of *why* she eats like she does. You need to take a step back from the physical for a bit and focus on her mental health. I suggest online resources surrounding eating disorders or therapy, if it seems quite bad. It's great that you want to help but this isn't the way. Initiate a conversation about her mental health first, and see where it goes.", "NTA. You are doing what you were asked to do and she is lucky that you are supportive. \n\nWhen she calms down you can ask her if she wants you to stop with the \"encouragement\".

If you were hounding her outside her desire, that would  be different,  but it sounds like you are trying to help encourage her in an endeavor she wants but is struggling with.", "NTA. She asked for accountability and you should gently remind her of that when she brings contradictory statements and actions to what she said she wanted. You\u2019ll be the bad guy at first but give it time she\u2019ll appreciate the support.", "NAH This is just not an ideal situation, imho. Weight and weight loss are touchy subjects.  This is just a tough scenario to be put in.\n\nHave you tried talking to her about all this?\n\nIf you think maybe being accountability partners might not be the best idea if you feel your fiancee is going to resent you for trying to motivate her and that in turn will just stress you out needlessly, than it seems more than fair to say you don't feel comfortable being in that role since it's just creating additional tension. It might feel too easy to project frustration at you and that's not fair to you and not even fair for her since it will distract from the actual goals you both have. There are many different ways to embrace lifestyle changes and maybe you both have different ideas about how to best obtain them.\n\nIf you think maybe it's just off to a rocky start but potentially might get easier, ask her how she would like to be supported specifically since your efforts  thus far haven't been well-received even though they seem sincere, well-intentioned and reasonable and seemingly exactly what she had asked for.\n\nDon't feel pressured if she isn't willing or able to meet ya halfway and accept the help you can give. There is only so much any other person can do. There is a reason why people hire personal trainers since they can represent an impartial influence as a professional but ultimately she has to find her own motivation within just as we all must.\n\nYou can still do you and follow what feels right for you in your journey but she may need to find her own way of doing things and it's important for you both to respect that just because you might be great partners romantically doesn't mean you have to be each other's accountability partners.\n\nBest of luck. You both deserve to be gentle and patient with yourselves and each other. I applaud you for trying.\n\nLet her know you love her no matter what and if she finds fault with that, it's on her.", "You're in a no-win situation here, my friend.  She's made you responsible for her weight loss, and you have to do all the work.  She'll cheat on the diet, and blame you for not losing weight.\n\nYou're going to get shit at both ends - forcing her to diet and exercise, and for the lack of results.\n\nBack the hell out of this responsibility as quick as you can.\n\nNTA", "OP a best friend lost their partner because despite all of their work to keep them healthy; they ended passing away because they refused to take care of themselves.  It took them some years to realize it was not their fault, having been together for over 25 years when they died.  As you two have been together for 14 years and your fiancee isn't pushing herself to get healthy but continue unhealthy habits by choice, you're going to have to ultimately choose what's in your best interests.  You can offer her all of the healthy options and encouragement available.  However, they always tell you to put your mask on first when the cabin loses pressure on an airplane, then assist the person next to you.  Too many people forget that.", "This isn't something you can do as someone's SO.  \n\nYou can be the tough-as-nails, drill sergeant who keeps her accountable OR you can be the guy who loves her no matter what and is there for her even when she's not being her best.  Not both.", "v p m mm", "NTA, but it is really hard to flip a switch and make a ton of life style changes all at once. Maybe give her a little grace and also maybe not dive right into it and have a more gradual approach. I\u2019d reconvene and discuss goals that are actually attainable for her for right now.", "When I read situations like these I almost always respond the same way.\n\nIt ultimately depends how persistent you are.\n\nYour role is to support her reaching her goals, not direct her to work toward them.\n\nIf she told you to back off, and then you did, then I think that's ok. If you keep bothering her about it when she clearly doesn't want you to do so then that's too much.\n\nWeight is a really sensitive issue for a lot of people and the reality is that the habits that must be changed are difficult and take a long time to establish.\n\nSo be supportive, but don't push.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA I was in a similar situation with my now wife before our wedding where we both kinda looked at the scale and saw numbers that blew our minds. I know everyone needs different motivations and not everything works for everyone but keeping each other honest and motivated is what really helped us get back to where we wanted to be. I don\u2019t think either of you are the AH necessarily unless she\u2019s legitimately mad at you because then that\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nAlso you mention you should\u2019ve eased her in somewhere in the comments but 2 walks and fish for a meal isn\u2019t exactly forcing her to run a marathon so don\u2019t be too hard on yourself. But in her defense starting a diet and workout routine can be challenging until you get over the hump and into a rhythm.", "NTA. My gf did this to and never seen anything wrong with what she said to me about it until her friends called her out", "NTA but you need to get out of this agreement you made. It\u2019s not going to be good for your relationship. I\u2019d tell her that you want to help motivate her, but will still respect her wishes. You\u2019ll offer to take a walk with her, but not force her to go.", "NAH. she's struggling, you're doing your best. i think it's not an asshole level thing but just social faux pas.", "NTA, But don't bother reminding her going forward. You can go ahead and take the walks if you feel like they'll benefit you, but she's going to need to take the lead herself if she's going to lose weight. Don't make yourself the bad guy.", "YTA. She\u2019s an adult; let her manage her own lifestyle choices.", "NTA. Sometimes it takes pushing to establish a routine. She asked you to help.

This is a fat, lazy, unmotivated individual. Get used to the fact that she is going to always be morbidly obese until she sees the light, most probably from a health scare.

Communication is a two way street.", "As someone who has lost a significant amount of weight myself, I\u2019d suggest supporting her in seeing a therapist, as this is Cleary getting her down, and a dietitian, who will be able to help her develop a manageable eating plan.

OP, congrats on recognizing an impossible situation... akin to the \"Do these pants make my butt look fat?\" dilemna.

I love you, no matter what size you are. But you can't offload responsibility for your daily choices of what you eat, and whether or not you exercise, onto me. That's not fair, and it makes you resent me when I speak up, which hurts my feelings. I'll walk with you happily, and suport you in your goals, but I will not be your nag or your conscience. So...what do you wanna do, here? What is your plan, and what -- if anything -- do you want me to ACTUALLY help you with?\"*\n\nNTA but please resign from the police department ;-)", "Easing into going for two walks?", "most definitely", "As I'm trying to lose weight, I can say I disagree with easing into it. I'd say just go for it. \n\nI just made the change over night a couple of weeks ago. Stopped drinking fizzy drinks, having one bowl of cereal at breakfast and an evening meal, Tonight was a lamb chop, and a pack of supernoodles with Mo-du mixed in. Nothing in between meals Some nights it's say, 3 eggs and 2 sausages with one slice of bread. The day defore I made the decision I was on 3 square meals a day, any one of which was probably more than my current daily in take, and on work days I'd be looking at 1-2 cans of Monster. And eating in between.\n\nI got used to eating less reasonably quickly. I'd say if I'd eased in, I'd have fallen off quicker. Let's say my meals stay the same to begin with but I limit myself to 1 can of Monster. That's a small start. Then during an especially tiring shift, hey, another Monster can't hurt, and I'm back to square one.", "I completely agree that something like a short little 20 minute walk would be very beneficial, but I\u2019m just saying that something like that is a great starting point in incorporating physical activity that doesn\u2019t feel so grueling. Maybe it starts with 20 minute morning walks, and as time passes maybe it turns into 30 minute walks or 20 minute bike rides, then maybe then it\u2019ll turn into 20 minute morning and evening walks, or whatever physical activity they see fit. I understand it\u2019s what she asked for, not to knock his fianc\u00e9 but sometimes what you say you can or will do and what you\u2019re actually capable of doing are two different things.", "That's very likely a part of it. But there's also the baggage of how she got here in the first place.", "You\u2019re taking it too far. Motivating does it mean forcing. All means is suggesting \u201chey let\u2019s go on a walk\u201d; that\u2019s it.  \n\nIf she really wants to lose weight, then she\u2019ll lose it. The most you can do is put her in situations where she has an opportunity, such as not buying pizza and hamburgers for dinner every night. \n\nEvery time you go on a walk, invite her. But that\u2019s it.", "yeah", "Don't confuse the right journey for you with the right journey for everyone. You're doing great, you've figured out a navigable road map for yourself, and that's great but it's not what works for everyone.", "That's great to hear that you've found something that works for you, I just believe small changes overtime just make it easier to create good habits rather than jumping straight into it.", "baggage?", "fair enough", "that's silly. This husband just wants what's best for his wife, and by her request, is helping her get to a point where she feels comfortable in her own skin, and can fit into clothes. If he never \"dragged\" her along to walks, she would never go on walks herself. She's an adult, but even adults have to be forced to do things in order to get what's needed of them done.", "What if it wasn't just a walk? What if it was something a little more? Like, when I take my pooch(in profile) out, it doesn't feel like work, or exercise. Just bonding with my blockhead. \n\nWould something like that be possible for her? \nAlso, for the diet, Caesar salad with chicken breast tendies. \nMakes for a great cold meal, on a stupid hot day. East prep and clean up too.", "Being fat isn't an accident but it's also not a choice. There's some aspects of her life that cause her to feel incapable of getting active and driving her towards easy, high calorie food.\n\nEta and these same factors are present in your current situation, along with the guilt and anger etc", "thanks for clarifying"]}
