Mom has been dating a 22 year old guy she met at the gym for about four months now.\n\nLeast to say, they have a pretty intense relationship, not shying away from PDA and such. They behave more like teens sometimes, constantly tagging each other on Instagram or always being on the phone (either talking or messaging) and they\u2019ve been generally spending a lot of time with each other. We\u2019ve had some argument about it, but last time they\u2019ve overstepped it completely.\n\nSo, I had to go away on a work trip for a couple days and I asked my Mom to come by my place and take care of my plants, since they need daily watering. She says OK, no trouble. I was supposed to come back yesterday at night, but timeline changed up a bit and I arrived during the day. I picked up a gift for Mom and then wanted to surprise her with my sudden arrival.\n\nI come back home I see some unknown coat in my hall. And I hear some noise coming from my own bedroom. I sense something fishy, I hear some guy\u2019s voice. In retrospect, I should have ran out of there. \n\nSo, I opened my bedroom\u2019s door and damn, there they were. So, in short and without being vulgar, my mom was standing naked on her knees, while the dude, just as naked, was sitting on my own bed. I completely froze up. There is also one physical detail, that is now forever burned into my brain and it makes things worse. A lot.\n\nMom got up immediately, she\u2019s all flustered, dude is trying to put his pants on ASAP. I\u2019ve started screaming and swearing, Mom says she didn\u2019t know I was coming back so early, I said it doesn\u2019t make things better. I said a lot of nasty words to them and practically pushed them out of the house. Mom has been calling and texting me, saying she\u2019s sorry, that her BF just gave her a ride to my place and one thing led to another. But I\u2019m just so over this.\n\nTL;DR I walked in on my Mom doing her BF on my bed and now I\u2019m not talking to her.
