I think that as long as you are in the room with her and supporting her emotionally and practically in any way you can, it is unreasonable to expect you to WATCH the medical procedure. You will be there when your child is born and you will support your wife, that is the important part. Not that you suffer equally to her - because lets be honest, you can never do that. \n\nI always think men who complain that the birth is hard FOR THEM are quite pathetic considering what the woman is going through. So I kind of understand where your wife is coming from (suck it up!!!) but I don\u2019t think you need to watch everything that goes on in the room.", "Honestly my husband watched my c section and I wish he hadn't been there. Afterwards he would tell the story to people about how the doctor used a device that looked like meat hooks to spread open my abdomen. He made it sound so disgusting and he would make jokes. NTA. It's your choice", "NTA I don\u2019t see what the problem is with staying up by her head. You don\u2019t need to see her insides.", "At first I thought I was going to have to answer Y T A because I thought you meant you weren't going to be in the room at all, but this line:\n\n*\"Besides, i did also mention that i'll be in the operation room to emotionally and physically support her through the delivery, just that i will not be watching the surgery\"*\n\nMakes you NTA. Yes unfortunately the woman has to be the one to go through the surgery, but I do not believe the partner needs to watch that one specific part as long as they are nearby to support their wife. That is a completely fine choice for the father (or any partner) to make in this situation.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s no way you can share the physical pain or trauma of childbirth. You certainly don\u2019t have to watch anything to be supportive. Just let the staff know you get queasy. Then keep talking to & supporting your wife.\n\nNo one but hospital staff should be telling men their options for managing their partner\u2019s childbirth experience. No one has to actually see their child being born unless they want to. There\u2019s not one rule for how every woman will give birth or how every father will participate.", "NTA\n\nI'm not saying I'd choose the same thing, but the point is that it is a choice. You're planning to be there to support her, you just don't want to look. \n\nFrankly, I'm a little surprised your wife isn't already aware of your general queasiness around blood and gore, but even so, it's something that should be discussed, understood and accepted between loving partners.\n\nEmotions are high, so give your wife patience to work through her feelings too.", "I\u2019ve had 3 c-sections. \n\nI don\u2019t know what country you\u2019re in but here in England my husband waited outside theatre whilst they gave me the spinal then they brought him in when I was laid down and the sheet was up so all he saw was my head, shoulders arms. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t \u201chear\u201d anything, the doctors talking, beeping of machines and then the baby is out and they held them above the sheet, he never saw anything beyond the sheet. They gave the baby to him all wrapped up no blood etc in sight.\n\nThe longest bit is them stitching you back up but you have the baby and aren\u2019t focussing anything on the other side of the curtain. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand what you think you will see that is gory etc, the operation is quiet apart from any suction machines, no saws etc.\n\nIf it\u2019s straight forward it\u2019ll probably be an hour or so from start to finish.", "NTA - if you didn't want to be in the room, that would be one thing, but it seems like you want to support her. So no wrongdoing. I would still be gentle with her in explaining and cite the people in post who explain that you aren't allowed to watch any ways because of the risk of fainting.", "YTA.  Why? Because you haven\u2019t done your research. Each hospital does it slightly different, but you can talk to them in advance.\n\nYou\u2019ll be sat down and blocked from seeing the surgery because some guys pass out when they see blood.  You\u2019ll be able to talk with your wife and hold her hand. They will pull out the baby and you will either be able to see the baby before being cleaned up or after.  You\u2019ll be escorted out with the baby while they finish up with your wife.\n\nSitting with her during the C section is the least you can do to support her.  Why haven\u2019t you talked to other Dads first?  By not doing your research, you\u2019re making your wife feel unsupported right before she gives birth.", "I've had two c-sections, and believe me.... she won't be watching the surgery either. She's going to be laying flat with her arms restrained, and a drape hanging between her head and abdomen to keep the field sterile and block her view.\n\nThere's no need for you to watch the gore. She's being weird and you're NTA.", "NTA maybe it's a miscommunication? And she thought you were going to leave for the surgery bit? Maybe just have another conversation and make it clear you will not leave her,.you will be next to her supporting her and holding her hand the whole way. Just not watching the actual incision.", "NTA. You\u2019ll be in the room, just focusing on her instead of the upsetting shit happening on the other side of the screen.\n\nYour \u201cbiological\u201d argument is pretty shit, though. Biological arguments usually are.\n\nExplain that you\u2019re protecting her. If you get sick or faint watching the surgery, suddenly the medical team has to deal with an unnecessary distraction.", "Info - you have given conflicting info - you responded to your wife implying you won\u2019t be in the operating room but then later said you will be in the delivery room? \n\nI had a c section nearly two years ago and partner was in there - very chill and he couldn\u2019t see anything. He was up at my head the whole time apart from cutting baby cord over at the cot. Be super supportive to your wife - NTA", "NTA. You\u2019ll be in the room, but you absolutely do not have to watch. If you\u2019re squeamish at all, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it. \n\nThey\u2019ll hold baby up over the curtain once they\u2019re out and show you.", "Um, you don't watch. There is a sheet that is rigged up at the chest and blocks view of the person being operated on and their support person. Not sure where either of you are getting the idea that either of you will be watching a medical procedure. You will be seated at her head behind the sheet.", "NTA. My husband recently witnessed me going through severe pancreatitis. I often wonder if it was more traumatic for him because I've largely forgotten the pain (the ketamine and fentanyl helped, lol) but he didn't have that luxury. I wouldn't wish 'sharing trauma' like that on anyone.\n\nAnd someone who's not equipped to handle it is going to add to the stress.", "NTA", "You don\u2019t need to watch, it will be behind a screen.\nAll you need to do is sit beside your wife and hold her hand.\n\nMy husband was like you and didn\u2019t want to watch, but I told him all he had to do was hold my hand and stay away from the business end.\n\nOn the day he was so excited he was down there watching and basically cheering\n\nYour NTA, but you\u2019ll regret it if you aren\u2019t there.", "NTA\n\nYou're not expected to watch the delivery in a C- section.   There is a curtain they do the surgery begins so you and your wife don't see what's going on. \n\nIf you're going to be in the operation room right with her, that's all you're expected to do.  I suggest talking to the doctor or nurse to clear it up for everyone.", "INFO: it sounds like you gave her two contradicting pieces of information. when she asked you to be in the room, did you initially say no? that is what your post suggests.", "NTA\n\nFrom everything you said you'd actually not even be the AH if you wouldn't be in the delivery room.\n\nI don't get it, your wife wants you to be discussed by seeing her opened up?", "INFO\n\nAre you saying that you will be in the room and just not watching the surgery? Or that you don't want to be in the room? Your initial post is ambiguous on that.", "Okay I was Y T A all through this until the end, so I N F O to clarify: you would be there with her, in the room, just not staring at her surgery and more up by her head supporting her?\n\nEdit: NTA after clarification, she\u2019s being unreasonable. You would be there for the babys first moments, and to support her, that\u2019s really all she can ask. As a currently pregnant woman I wouldn\u2019t really want my SO watching me get cut open I\u2019d want him by my side, and if you\u2019re queasy about those types of things the odds of you passing out and taking the focus off of her is high.", "Info: Will you be in the operating room during the C-section or not? First you said it's too gross for you to handle being in the room and next you say you will be there. So which is it?", "INFO will your wife be conscious for the C section portion of the delivery?  This is something you need to talk with the doctor about.  There are procedures for people to be there for the C section but screened from the \"bloodier\" parts of the process.  It sounds like it's important to her that you be present-- but you don't sound even willing to do the most basic research to see if it can be worked out.  Unless you have an actual medical/mental health reason why you can't be in the delivery room you need to step up and find a way to make it work.", "For a c-section they usually hang something that blocks the mother's view (because we get to be conscious, how fun!) and if the partner sits next to the mother they won't see anything either. My husband basically throws up when he sees blood, but he was totally fine this way.If it IS a c-section, it won't nearly be as bad as you think. And your wife will be freaked out and scared and drugged, so your presence will probably mean the world to her.You can do this!  \n\n\nEdit to add: NAH", "YTA. Having had a c-section, I will tell you that there is no sound of her being cut open. The OR is too loud for that. And you will be holding her hand and watching her face. Also, you won\u2019t see her intestines, unless they really screw it up. \n\nThey\u2019re going to be so fast and you\u2019ll be so pre-occupied with your wife and baby that you won\u2019t be paying attention. Also, they usually have a curtain/drape up to not freak everyone out. Even if you\u2019re at her head you won\u2019t see much. \n\nThey\u2019re not as awful as you think. The doctors are trying to control blood loss. It\u2019s not going to be like a massacre. \n\nYou got her pregnant. It takes two for a pregnancy. You owe it to her to be in the room when they deliver YOUR child. \n\nMy husband has extreme anxiety and he managed. You can do it too.", "YTA. Also this is the type of thing that destroys a marriage long term. May not be immediate, but she will NEVER forgive you and it will always be hanging above your relationship. My husband is my everything and if he told me this it would change how I saw him. He never would of course because he always puts his love for me above his convenience.", "YTA. Yes men don't biologically have to carry kids, and another good thing to know if that women prefer not to be with men that are going to leave them to do all the heavy lifting on their own. We'd rather just find a better partner. Apologize to your wife for being so selfish and tell her you will be there for her through the good and the bad...and the queasy.", "Where are you from? Because where I live (I don't know if those are universal standards) you wouldn't be allowed to be in the room for the ripping open bit, but you'd be brought in for the taking the baby out bit, so that you could cut the umbilical cord. Also, they usually put up screens, so that even when you're handed the baby you don't see \"the gore\". \n\nAdditionally, you have to sign a statement saying that you understand that if you faint you might not be taken care of until the medical staff can make time for you. So, if you know you cannot deal with seeing certain things, it's your responsibility to not inconvenience the staff.\n\nYou're going to be there for her and with her. That's what's important.\n\nNTA", "I will gently say YTA.  I was there for all 3 of my wife's C Sections.  It wasn't because I wanted to be.  My wife was completely draped and sitting by her head, I was unable to see her being cut open or anything.  And that was just fine.  I was there for her while she was going through it and that's where you need to be as well.\n\nOf course with the first C Section she asked me to take a look and tell her what's happening.  And like the young idiot I was, I did that.  And almost passed out.  She never asked me to do that again and I never volunteered to.  But I was there for all 3.  And you should be as well.  Make sure the attending nurses know you don't want to see what's going on and I'm sure they will set it up so you won't see much.  Believe me, they don't want you vomiting or passing out in the OR either.  And if your wife wants you to look, DON'T DO IT.", "YTA!! You wanted a child, deal with the gore for a bit.", "You will regret missing that moment. I did it once, horrible mistake. My one of my children is now 14, too many times I've had to live through the story of not being at mommy's side while she was born.", "YTA - she needs a partner to be there for support. You don't have to watch, just stay on the other side of the curtain, turn your head the other way, and hold her hand. Be there for your wife and the new life that she is sacrificing her body to bring into this world.", "YTA - sack up and support your wife. I get nauseous about blood too yet I managed to give birth", "YTA\n\n>I said that if biologically the men do not have to share it, then it's a choice they can make on if they want to or not.\n\nSaying the quiet part out loud eh? \n\n\nYou don't see anything. Just say that you don't value supporting your partner during one of the most terrifying events of her life. Also showing her what kind of father you will be", "YTA if you won\u2019t go in the operating room with her (your wording is a bit weird so idk if that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing or not). Imo, you can\u2019t make her have that surgery on her own. However, you do not need to watch it. There\u2019s a sheet up so you don\u2019t see anything.", "Did you not even Google this. They out up a curtain so you can't see the surgery even if you're in the room with your wife. Jesus I feel for this poor woman. YTA.", "YTA\n\nHer reason, sharing the trauma, isn\u2019t something I agree with. That makes it sound like the reason you should do it is to earn some merit badge to say you did it. In all honesty, you\u2019ll never be able to truly share the trauma, because you\u2019ll never be able to fully empathize with what she goes through, it\u2019s just not possible because your experiences will be so different. \nInstead, the reason you should be there for your wife is because she is going to experience something deeply traumatic, and you being there will make it easier for her. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re a loving husband, and you\u2019ve done countless things for your wife during her pregnancy. As you say, fathers have no biological inherent responsibly in childbearing, so it\u2019s commendable when they stick around and help. It would be commendable for you to help her through what is in some ways the most challenging and scary part of the journey. If she\u2019s reaching out, and telling you she wants you there, you should consider being there even if you know it\u2019ll be hard for you. Being in the room and holding her hand will probably be enough, even if you avert your eyes from the actual surgery itself.", "YTA. \n\nWatching is so much less traumatic than experiencing it as the person giving birth. This is your wife and mother of your child on one of the most important and scariest days of her life. The fact that you are giving her something else to worry about on top of bringing your child into this world is incredibly selfish.", "YTA. I hope she leaves you and finds someone who\u2019ll actually be there for her", "NTA\n\nThere are numerous cases of men getting traumatised by this. \"research found PTSD displayed by men following birth...

It would differ from hospital to hospital but rule of thumb is dads would be sat next to mums head so you can talk and see each other but the curtain blocks what\u2019s actually happening. My little one needed emergency care straight after being born so I didn\u2019t get to see him but the nurse took my husband over to see him when they were working on him. They had to walk my husband passed me and the nurse literally grabbed his shoulders and told him not to look. I think the drs just assume you don\u2019t want to see that unless you ask to see it. Honestly I would just tell your wife you will be there with her and neither of you need to stress about it", "If you can\u2019t handle the mess of a birth you\u2019re going to HATE parenthood.", "YTA if I'm interpreting your post right. It sounds like you're saying you'll be in the room to support her until the actual surgery, and then you'll leave before they start the cut. That's shitty as hell. To leave at the moment she's most vulnerable and scared? It's not like a normal surgery where you go to sleep and then it's over-- she's awake and aware. The role of the support person is to support the woman giving birth. Getting to share in the experience is a bonus most spouses want, but not the primary reason to be there. \n\nIf you absolutely can't be in the room because you think you'll pass or vomit even if you can't actually see anything, then you need to work with your wife to find a support person who can stay the whole time. Her mom, a close friend, etc. Only one person can be in the OR and it should be somebody who can support her and advocate for her if things go south.", "YTA..suck it up dude. There's a drape that prevents you from seeing anything. And if hearing anything makes you puke or pass out, someone will take care of you and you will be embarrassed for your lifetime everytime the story us told. And it will be told,by your wife, over and over again. She put up with 9 months of discomfort, has to endure a cutting procedure and recover while taking care of a baby. You better be the most helpful father in the world, waiting on her and baby while she recovers. Be a man!", "YTA\n\nSupport your baby mama. She doesn't want it to actually happen to her, either, the least you can do is stay with her while it does. You need to step up here. All you're doing is telling her you won't be there for her or your kid if things get tough\n\nShe wants you to be able to understand what she's going through. Actually watching is a big way to do that. Furthermore, she probably wants someone not going through it to have eyes on the kid. You can't do anything, but you can relay info. It's part security blanket for her. She's gonna be out of it while it's happening and possibly not able to assess the situation well. You are her back up that's not being cut open. Not knowing what's going on has been a huge stressor for a couple of my friends, one who was deliberately kept in the dark by her doctor and actually was treated for ptsd afterwards from how tge c section went down. She couldn't talk about it for a long time after.

There was a fabric screen up, but I could still see around it and I found it very interesting to watch each time. If you don't want to watch, don't watch. I'd think as long as you're there in the room being supportive, it should be enough. Once the baby is out and cleaned up you should be able to hold it and let your wife see while they stitch her up (at least that's how it worked out for me).", "I'm going with an NAH.

Believe me\u2026delivery room staff do not want the father watching if there is even the slightest possibility he\u2019s gonna hit the deck.

Thinking and reason are just crutches for those with insufficient rage. /s", "Op contradicts himself, at the beginning he says \u201cshe asked if I will be in the operating room when the baby is delivered and I responded saying it\u2019s too queasy and gory\u201d yet later said \u201ci did mention that I\u2019ll be in the operation room to emotionally and physically support her.\u201d So it\u2019s unclear what he\u2019s planning to do. \nGeez, I hope my post doesn\u2019t come off as rageful, I think OP sounds like a great and loving husband who just has a bit of fear.", "Agreed he contradicts himself", "There\u2019s a sheet blocking the view, so being in the room is not the same as watching the scalpel cut into his wife.   He doesn\u2019t contradict himself.", "All of this is considered in Europe too but the doctor has the final saying. You must provide your file with medical conditions and history and based on that they'll determin which approach is the best. Also they opt for c section if natural labor goes wrong.", "I think homeboy is just squeamish. His post was confusing cause it contradicts itself, first he says he doesn't want to be in the room with her, then he says he wants to be in the room but just not see the gore. I think knowing which one he actually is trying to say makes the difference between him being the asshole or not.", "Same in US. Dude just talking out his ass calling him YTA. Well I got news for ya bucko", "You guys realize that getting cancer and getting pregnant are very different right?? He chose to impregnate her. An illness is not at all comparable. Seriously the overreach is absolutely laughable.", "I promise if he tells him he can\u2019t watch the actual surgery, they\u2019ll make sure he can\u2019t. No one in the OR has time to deal with fainting daddies. We used to drape so no one could see. Now we use lower drapes and even clear drapes so you can see. It can absolutely be done.", "Exactly it\u2019s not like they cut her in half lol.  He\u2019s either going to be in the operating room or not.", "It does, this is where the education comes in. If he took the time to ask he would find out that he isn't going to see any \"gore\" with the drapes he would have to look over to see anything. Also many OR's (mine included), often times provide a chair for the SO to sit in. The post makes him sound like an AH. He's also going to have to get use to the gross stuff being a parent isn't a clean job especially in the first few years.", "What kind of asshole wants to inflict pain on others just because they\u2019re in pain?\n\nAlso he didn\u2019t necessarily choose to get her pregnant. Plus by your logic she chose to get pregnant, so she shouldn\u2019t be complaining."]}
