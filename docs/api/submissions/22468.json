So I can see why this would be happening in the first place.", "Its a common practice.  If postman/delivery driver can't deliver to the named recipient, it's very common to ask a neighbour to take it.

Postman/delivery driver always leaves info with named recipient as to where their package is", "Barely ever spoken to him, nothing more than a ''good moring'' type thing.

Can\u2019t be arsed to collect, I\u2019ll just stop accepting. I\u2019m the only one on the street that works from home.

I've never heard of this and think it's strange. I would most definitely not want one of my neighbors to pick up my packages.

The neighbour had all the time in the world to go collect it... Don't know why he had to get angry. I thought it was like him waiting very long for the parcel, then went to multiple channels to find out that is has been delivered, and jump through hoops to find out it was with another person. \n\nHonestly for OP, he should publicly declare he's ok to take anyone's parcel, except that neighbour's one, unless that fellow apologizes. Even then, I'm petty and will still not help.", "Who said they're in the US?"]}
