It\u2019s not a nice gesture when it\u2019s creating more hassle for the person the package is intended for. OP is more concerned with appearing nice when in reality they aren\u2019t helping this particular neighbor at all.", "It depends on the company, too.\n\nI worked at a company that required explicit written authorization from the recipient to leave the package with anyone else.\n\nWe couldn't even deliver to other members of the same household or security at apartment buildings if we didn't have at least a text message that said \"I [recipient] authorize company to deliver the package to [person]\"", "I'm going to assume you're American. OP isn't doing it to appear nice, they're doing it because it's part of how our postal system works. The person being unhelpful in this dynamic is the neighbour who isn't collecting it from OP as they aren't playing their role in the system.\n\nI understand that it doesn't work like that where you live.", "Why would you want to be responsible for a package that belongs to a person you don\u2019t regularly speak to? \n\nIt being common practice does not mean that OP is required to take it. OP is more concerned with appearing nice when in reality they aren\u2019t helping this particular neighbor at all.", "We actually have bigger issues with theft from private delivery companies who, thanks to covid social distancing, just leave it on the doorstep and take a picture. The theft typically isn't from neighbours but from the drivers rhemselves who submit the photo, never ring your doorbell/knock and then take the parcel. \n\nNever had an issue of neighbours taking in a parcel and not giving it back. It's just etiquette. In fact, we had a lot of pet food mistakenly delivered to a neighbour because someone got our house number wrong. They visited every neighbour they knew with an animal to try and get it to the right owners because I kept missing them every time I went to retrieve it from them.", "UK person here who frequents online shopping sites. I have never had to deal with this and several of my parcels have been left with neighbours/left in the storage box at the front of my house. We just get a slip through the letterbox telling us where it is. We also do the same for our neughbours too.", "Stolen packages are actually very rare after delivery, I've only ever had items disappear in transit. Because of the safe place rules, items can only be left in a preapproved safe place (e.g. porch) or with a neighbour and you get a royal mail signed note through the letterbox stating where it is. Expectation is for you to pick it up from said neighbour at the earliest convenience. Neighbour can also refuse to take it in of course (e.g. if I'm heading away overnight so they wouldn't be able to collect from me). Postie would then try someone else or take it back to the post office and attempt delivery another 2 times (following working days), if you still aren't there to take in your parcel, you have to go pick it up from the post office. Much safer than abandoned parcels sitting by the front door for hours. Other services like dpd take a photo of the delivery to prove it was left in a safe place. If the item was never delivered or was left somewhere unsecured then you can follow up with the delivery company or get the sender to chase them. \n\nIt is fascinating how other countries do it. If US posties leave packages on doorsteps, is that why people always say about porch pirates? That's not a thing I've encountered over here. If anything is unclear from my rambling, please feel free to ask", ">How can packages can even be insured if every Joe can say they're a neighbor and fuck off with the package?\n\nJust to clarify here, nobody is just saying they're a neighbour and waltzing off with a parcel. The postie or delivery company will knock on your door if you are a neighbour and ask if you'll accept delivery on their behalf. They then make a record of where the parcel has been delivered.", "> The neighbours taking the parcel is literally part of the system.\n\nIndeed, just like theft!\n\n> The delivery company will leave you a card with a note of whether your parcel is with a neighbour, returned to the depot or left somewhere else.\n\nDo they include the identity/address of the neighbor?\n\n> It's nothing to do with neighbours not \"letting\" anything happen.\n\nIf someone took my packages without asking me first, the police would be involved, and that much is completely normal where I live. Package theft is no joke.\n\n> How are parcels insured in America when they're left outside of the property where anyone can take them? Parcel theft here happens here too, just because the way deliveries are done is different doesn't mean you have no recourse.\n\nSo a claim of \"package not present\" would not be disputed as \"left with neighbor\"? IF the system works, it works!", "> Just to clarify here, nobody is just saying they're a neighbour and waltzing off with a parcel. The postie or delivery company will knock on your door if you are a neighbour and ask if you'll accept delivery on their behalf.\n\nWow, that's something. Wouldn't work a minute where I'm from.\n\n> They then make a record of where the parcel has been delivered.\n\nMost probably by taking note of the individual or the \"other\" address? It's all so alien to me!", "Saying \"its common practice\" is like saying \"it's common sense.\" Theres way too much context and cultural assumptions involved for that to mean anything", "Good god. I've never seen anybody try so hard not to understand something so straightforward.", "You seem to be making a point of not understanding that things are done differently in different countries.\n\nI've explained how it's different, how it works in your country is irrelevant to the post because the OP does not live there.\n\nEnjoy being obtuse."]}
