The theft typically isn't from neighbours but from the drivers rhemselves who submit the photo, never ring your doorbell/knock and then take the parcel. \n\nNever had an issue of neighbours taking in a parcel and not giving it back. It's just etiquette. In fact, we had a lot of pet food mistakenly delivered to a neighbour because someone got our house number wrong. They visited every neighbour they knew with an animal to try and get it to the right owners because I kept missing them every time I went to retrieve it from them.", "UK person here who frequents online shopping sites. I have never had to deal with this and several of my parcels have been left with neighbours/left in the storage box at the front of my house. We just get a slip through the letterbox telling us where it is. We also do the same for our neughbours too.", "Stolen packages are actually very rare after delivery, I've only ever had items disappear in transit. Because of the safe place rules, items can only be left in a preapproved safe place (e.g. porch) or with a neighbour and you get a royal mail signed note through the letterbox stating where it is. Expectation is for you to pick it up from said neighbour at the earliest convenience. Neighbour can also refuse to take it in of course (e.g. if I'm heading away overnight so they wouldn't be able to collect from me). Postie would then try someone else or take it back to the post office and attempt delivery another 2 times (following working days), if you still aren't there to take in your parcel, you have to go pick it up from the post office. Much safer than abandoned parcels sitting by the front door for hours. Other services like dpd take a photo of the delivery to prove it was left in a safe place. If the item was never delivered or was left somewhere unsecured then you can follow up with the delivery company or get the sender to chase them. \n\nIt is fascinating how other countries do it. If US posties leave packages on doorsteps, is that why people always say about porch pirates? That's not a thing I've encountered over here. If anything is unclear from my rambling, please feel free to ask", ">How can packages can even be insured if every Joe can say they're a neighbor and fuck off with the package?\n\nJust to clarify here, nobody is just saying they're a neighbour and waltzing off with a parcel.

Package theft is no joke.\n\n> How are parcels insured in America when they're left outside of the property where anyone can take them? Parcel theft here happens here too, just because the way deliveries are done is different doesn't mean you have no recourse.\n\nSo a claim of \"package not present\" would not be disputed as \"left with neighbor\"?

And them attempting to deliver it again is also often not going to work, because the post usually gets delivered during normal working hours when a lot of people aren't going to be home.\n\nIt's standard practice here to do this, as it makes life a little easier for your neighbours.

However, many delivery drivers (UPS, FedEx, etc.) will leave larger packages with the neighbor if the person isn't home or at least they used to where I'm from.

Most likely the UK, Australia or NZ (Aotearoa). In the UK you get asked to take parcels for your neighbour, then they get a parcel slip through the door saying who has it. \n\nIt's considered \"delivered\" at that point and a lot of tracking info will have \"handed to neighbour at number (X)\" as an option. From there the responsibility is on the recipient to go get their parcel from whoever has it.\n\nThe only time this breaks down is if you *don't* get a note. That happened with a bike we had delivered and the neighbours eventually came round and told us they had it because it was taking up so much room in their hallway - we were very apologetic and they understood completely when I let them know I had no idea they had it!\n\nOP's neighbour should be grateful that he's been taking in parcels, it's infinitely preferable that a neighbour take it than the usual Yodel/DHL/Evri drop off points of \"I left it on your front step in the rain\" or \"I threw it in the hedge\"", "Yeah. I didn't think OP was in the US. I was just responding to the person who said it's not common in the US because it definitely is in some places. \n\nWhen I lived in the UK, it happened all the time.

They've started doing a really fun thing where when they get behind on their round they mark stuff as \"delivered\" without delivering it, and then drop it round at some unspecified point the next morning (presumably so they don't get in trouble for undelivered parcels). It's an absolute shambles of a system, tbh. The Royal Mail are the only ones doing a decent job.", "That's really annoying. I can see why they would prefer to just leave it with anyone else in the building since they usually can't get inside and would otherwise have to come back to redeliver if the person isn't home, but marking it as delivered and coming back later is shady.", "The thing is, it's considered good manners to take it in, and you are absolutely doing the neighbour a favour. Because if you don't take it in, the couriers are so crap that they will often leave it nebulous, unsecure places like \"behind the bins\", \"under the hedge\" or just straight up on your doorstep where anyone could take it. If you're lucky, it'll get taken back to the depot and you'll have to drive out to an industrial estate somewhere to get it. If you're even luckier you'll get a note telling you where the hell your stuff even is.\n\nHe should stop taking in this person's packages, and I expect he will. But it'll be because the neighbor has exhausted his supply of goodwill and helpfulness, not because he should never have been taking the packages in the first place or that it's somehow nefarious to do so."]}
