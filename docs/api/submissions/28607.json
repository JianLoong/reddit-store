Try explaining to her calmly that it makes you uncomfortable, and that you prefer not to be touched on the butt.  It's not personal, just a boundary that you have.  Hopefully she'll understand.

I barely see any responses saying this was a sexual thing - everyone is just agreeing is a DISRESPECTFUL thing. Nor does it teach children bodily autonomy - as a parent I know saying that it's okay for me to touch my children in ways they don't like simply because I'm their mother; only sets up a president for them to be convinced by others that it's okay for them to touch them in ways unwanted because of THEIR relationship. This is even something touched on in child psychology and family therapy - that it teaches kids they DON'T have the right to make decisions about who touches them and it sticks with them long term. Even my own mother being a very touchy person set me up for very, very bad understanding of situations when I was a kid and teen.", "When was the last time you touched a blade of grass?", "I meant count by keep track off but thank you for worrying about me! <3", "crusty can be used to mean creepy. especially when referring to the creepy crusty old guy stereotype.\nNTA regardless.", "Moms do do this. She didn\u2019t know it was a boundary and now she does. She\u2019s not crying she was just confused because she has probably done it his whole life. If anything embarrassed bc she didn\u2019t know it made him uncomfortable. Now if she does it anyway THEN it becomes wrong.", "This post was talking about if it's right for OPs mother to IGNORE them saying to not do it and call them mean. Which it's NOT.

It\u2019s *not* a mom thing. \n\nIt may be a *your mom* thing but what it\u2019s like to be your mom\u2019s child/adult child is not something you can responsibly assume is about mothers in general.\n\nYou also seem to have missed the extra evidence that OP\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t respect boundaries. And I doubt OP has behaved like previous instances of that behavior were super great.\n\nOP, I do not doubt that your mom is a three-dimensional lovable humanity-human.\n\nThat said, I think you might find useful information if you google *emotional/covert incest*.

That was the first she heard of it and didn\u2019t know it was a problem. Let me restate then some mothers do this, some don\u2019t. It was in no way incest related. He clearly stated she does it as a joke and likely will no longer do so now that he expressed how it made him feel", "Her calling OP mean and pouting about being asked to not touch their butt is ACTIVELY disrespecting their boundaries. Did you even read the post?", "Yes she called him mean but your making it up that she was pouting bc it didn\u2019t say that once he said she was confused did you even read it? Likely called him mean for how he said it to her when he previously said nothing about it before which is why he asked if he was too harsh to her. We don\u2019t know the tone in how he said it. That\u2019s why he was asking if he was being to harsh and if he should\u2019ve said it differently."]}
