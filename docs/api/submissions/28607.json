Try explaining to her calmly that it makes you uncomfortable, and that you prefer not to be touched on the butt.  It's not personal, just a boundary that you have.  Hopefully she'll understand.

It doesn't matter that once upon a time she changed your diapers when you were too young and vulnerable to take care of yourself, you are old enough now to vocalize your personal boundaries and nobody has the 'right' to access your body if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\nObviously this is a low stakes version of this. I don't think your mom was sexualizing you, but she was making you uncomfortable and you were 100% justified in telling her to stop.", "Here\u2019s the thing. You grew up with certain behaviours, so to you, it\u2019s \u201cnormal.\u201d  You were taught to accept them. \n\nBut for outside observers, things don\u2019t have that added layer. \n\nThe fact that she said anything other than \u201cok\u201d is, in fact, creepy and inappropriate.", "How do we know OP is a she? I've looked through their comments, and they never indicate their gender.", "It\u2019s not about this post specifically. Its a rant about something that happens a lot in this sub. Mods deleted it tho", "Referring to me, huh? I'm old. And now that I'm over 50, I'm the creepy old guy, who is single. Fucking please. I've friends that are 20 and friends that are 70 and 80.\n\nNow. Back to OP. If you don't like it, then she shouldn't do it. Growing up, I told my kids I would stop tickling them when they are 42. But I don't tickle them like they are 2 years old. I'm not blowing tummy kisses or weird shit like that. But they get side tickles and shoulder tickles. If they say stop, no more that day. We each know about it and they do it to me. \n\nBut no. Just no with poking the butt.", "Well you didn't really phrase it well then, because I did see it before the comment got deleted and it seemed like you were complaining about reactions to this post.", "Pouting, telling your child their MEAN for them not letting you touch their butt IS being actively disrespectful. She legit told him that she basically doesn't respect his autonomy. It's not normal for a mother to feel rejected by that. I am both a mother, and an ECP. (Early childhood psychologist) and this behaviour is not okay from the mother. I'm not overreacting, I'm talking about the very real pattern of thought this sets up in children. Everything I've stated is a fact, not thoughts based off how I feel. You also VERY clearly didn't even read my comment - because I explicitly state that what the mother did is NOT sexual. It's just disrespectful and sets up a bad president for children understanding they can say no to ANYONE. \nEdit: my comment posted twice in response so I deleted one.", "Do you know what covert/emotional incest is?\n\nEta: \n\nI\u2019m not being alarmist really. I\u2019ve studied a lot about family dynamics, healthy vs unhealthy behaviors, etc. I try to help people find resources that may empower them. \n\nI do not *at all* approve of a woman poking her son\u2019s butt. This is straightforward. Our parents ought not treat their kids\u2019 bodies as they wouldn\u2019t treat anyone else\u2019s bodies at an age like the OP\u2019s (old enough to cogently write this post). \n\nTry to imagine being in the mother\u2019s position. What would it feel like to be compelled to poke your son\u2019s (or daughter\u2019s) butt? Is what you\u2019re doing aligned with your role as a parent? Are you showing your kid affection or are you using them?\n\nEdit: deleted the word medical \u2014 no clue why it was in there", "This", "Sorry I guess I should have said \"standing in your child's room and looming over them so they can FEEL how upset you are\" instead of simplifying her behaviour of hovering and complaints and looking upset to \"pouting\"", "Mothers should not take their kids\u2019 physical boundaries personally. They shouldn\u2019t take their kids personally *in general*. It is not a friendship and it is not a partnership. \n\nIt is the mother\u2019s job to treat her son differently than this mother did in the OP\u2019s story."]}
