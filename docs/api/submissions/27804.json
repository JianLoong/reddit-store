So I told my wife I wanted a divorce but said I was happy to co-parent our 1 year old she agreed. We both lived in London until recently I moved to Switzerland to live with my now husband and we got married there. I didn\u2019t invite my ex as she had a new boyfriend who me and our little boy don\u2019t like and I knew he would definitely say something homophobic at the wedding. \nI have complete custody of our son as he wanted to live with me and my ex agreed. Now our son was at the wedding and looked so smart so I sent photos to my ex and she started messaging me and calling me telling me I am so rude for not inviting her or even telling her and she did she wanted our son back with her, I said no and now all her family are messaging me saying I am an asshole and should\u2019ve told her. Idk if I am or not. \n\nNote: the agreement about custody was in court and she knew at the time I had a fianc\u00e9 so idk what she was expecting to happen in the future", "created_utc": 1695914165, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16uiq81/aita_for_not_telling_my_exwife_i_got_married_again/", "score": 4375, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She found out from the picture.", "YTA for not telling her. \nNTA for not inviting her. \n\nStep parents have rights in many countries.

And legal changes.  You say she knew you were engaged.  But in most places, when you legally marry lots of things change.  Have you had discussions with child's other parent and new spouse regarding a new will.  Many times life insurance, pension benefits, asset distribution all change with marriage.  If you were hit by a bus tomorrow, in many places your son went from getting everything to a portion, if he lives with you how long will new husband have him before mom picks him up, end of school year immediately.

Now our son was at the wedding and looked so smart so I sent photos to my ex and she started messaging me and calling me telling me I am so rude for not inviting her or even telling her and she did she wanted our son back with her, I said no and now all her family are messaging me saying I am an asshole and should\u2019ve told her.

Even with full custody, 'co-parenting' implies some level of involvement on the mother's part, no?

Depending on how often OP and his son saw her, it's possible she didn't know, or he may have told her he was travelling or something. Or maybe this is all conjecture, but it seems odd that the actual marriage set her off to that extent.\n\nAnd yes, she does have the right to care, custody arrangements or not. It's her child, she may or may not have even met the new husband, and she may or may not be okay with her child living in another country.

OP has not petitioned for, nor been granted, sole custody (which would deny his ex-wife any custodial rights).\n\nAn English family court judge is definitely going to ask a 5yo (in court with both parents present, and probably separately in chambers with a social worker present) which parent he wants to live with and take that into account when delivering judgement. \n\nGiven how many people move to different countries for work in Europe this is a fairly common custody arrangement, maybe less often than before Brexit but people do still have European careers not just English careers.

Sometimes the SAHP/SAHM loses custody because her ex has the money for a good lawyer and can provide in ways she can\u2019t. \n\nI think it also depends on how much the other parent pushes for having custody.

You're not really raising your kid if you only see them every other weekend, and you shouldn't be forced to stay in your marriage if you're unwilling to agree to that arrangement.\n\nThis whole thing is really weird.
