You don\u2019t necessarily have to tell her this weekend, you could reach out to your brother and tell him you\u2019re really uncomfortable with the situation you want to give him the chance to do the right thing and tell her but if he isn\u2019t going to man up and do it that you\u2019re going to say something. Put a deadline on it. \n\nMost likely eventually she\u2019s going to end up finding out and you don\u2019t want her to realize that you already knew, then she\u2019s being betrayed by both of you.", "NTA, but talk to Ray privately (not in front of the kids) and gently and do not exaggerate what you saw.

On the other hand, you're brother might not forgive you for telling her. But he knows damn well what he is doing is wrong. He'll look for somewhere to place the blame, and unfortunately that will probably be you. \n\nYou WNBTA at all. She's your best friend. She needs to know the truth so she can make a decision about her future. The only AH here is your brother. This is his mess to fix", "NTA. If you were in her position, wouldn\u2019t you want to know?", "NTA. She deserves to know. Even if they have some sort of arrangement I would still tell her. You have him the ultimatum of \u201ceither you tell her or I will\u201d, so in my mind you\u2019re clear to tell her when the time seems right.\n\nI think there was another post here? Or maybe on BORU (or I saw it both places?) where a woman was in a similar situation and had the perfect way of approaching the issue with her friend (can\u2019t recall if it was friend or sister?) anyway I\u2019ll try to dig it up.\n\nEdit: typo cuz of my fat fingers on mobile", "NTA.

That's a betrayal of your friend.\n\n\nBut the situation sucks, and Ray could explode on you for telling her.

Let Ray deal with that knowledge.", "Ahhh what a sticky situation. Definitely puts you in a tough spot. If I were you, I would\u2019ve done everything you have so far tbh. Warning your brother that you saw him with another woman and even giving him the chance to tell Ray was a good choice. Sounds like he had no reaction or didn\u2019t care at all to you saying this, and since she is your best friend (even if she wasn\u2019t) for so long you definitely have every right to tell her what you saw. \n\nThis situation really sucks because you\u2019re in between your best friend and your brother. Maybe even try to tell him again that she\u2019s coming over later, and you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to keep it a secret since it\u2019s eating you up.

He cannot think his secret will stay hidden. \n\nThis is NOT a topic to discuss with children present. \n\nWhen you tell your friend, be prepared to help her through her reaction, whatever it may be.

On one hand, you have your loyalty to your best friend and your desire to see her treated with respect and honesty in her relationship. On the other hand, you have your relationship with your brother, and you don't want to cause conflict or damage that relationship.\r  \n\r  \nIt's ultimately up to you to decide what to do, but it's important to consider the potential consequences of your actions. If you choose to tell Ray what you saw, it's possible that your brother's relationship with her could be damaged or ended, and your relationship with your brother could also be affected. However, if you choose to keep the information to yourself, you may be complicit in allowing Ray to be treated dishonestly.\r  \n\r  \nIt might be helpful to have a conversation with your brother, and see if he is willing to talk about the situation or have a conversation with Ray. You could also suggest that he seek counseling or therapy to address the issues in his relationship and his behavior.\r  \n\r  \nIt's important to remember that you can't control the outcome of this situation, and that ultimately, it's not your responsibility to \"fix\" things for your brother and your friend. You can only control your own actions, and you should do what you believe is best for yourself and for the people you care about.", "YWNBTA Your friend deserves better than to be lied to by two people she loves.

Just being out with a member of the opposite sex isn't automatically cheating.  \n\nBut again, you aren't wrong if you choose to tell her.  Its just going to have long lasting repercussions for you going forward.", "I agree there might be an innocent explanation. But I don't think so.
