Since her boyfriend is old fashioned he never respected me working to put myself through school and was always making comments on how I never went out with my friends, I'm a nerd/homebody, and how his kids had a great social life. We've had a few big incidents when we talk about our days during dinner and he makes those kinds of comments, I REALLY don't do well with men who have loud voices so usually (to my mother's advice) I just ignore what he says completely.  but it quickly escalated to him making those comments to other members of our family. \n\nMy mother is from a less traditional Asian country but my aunts, uncles, and grandparents all value hard work and education so, needless to say, they haven't been very impressed with him. \n\nFrom talking with my older brother recently about our trip plans (since we haven't been out to visit our family in about 10 years due to paying for our schooling/pandemic restrictions).

If I ask her not to bring him I'd probably have to explain that basically all of her family doesn't like him and that might really crush her since she likes him a lot.

How do you think this will go? If it\u2019s just going to cause hard feelings or make your mother feel like she needs to choose between her family and her SO, then it\u2019s better to not say anything.\n\nETA I\u2019m not judging you either way. I\u2019m just saying that you can\u2019t undo this once it\u2019s done and you will have to live with the consequences of being the self appointed family \u201cspokesperson\u201d.", "info: are you telling your mom YOU don't want him to come, and why..  or would you be telling her the family doesn't want him there?  because the answers are different.", "Do not, absolutely do not say that the family doesn't want him there if they haven't come out and said that. I can foresee that backfiring on you badly. I have a nagging feeling bringing this up is going to cause many problems.  But nta for not wanting him to go.", "NTA, but I wouldn't be the one to ask her not to bring the boyfriend if I were you. If someone doesn't want him there, then let them do their own dirty work. But let me say this. If this boyfriend goes off on your 97 year old grandfather, then I hope the whole group of you kick this guy out. He sounds like a freeloader. He moved in with your mother to save money but he has a problem with you working and making money. I think he has a problem with women working and being independent.", "Perhaps ask your family if someone / you could approach your mom one-on-one and state that \u201cthe family\u201d would prefer the bf not go. Then your mom could maybe tell her bf \u201chey let\u2019s go on a trip instead!\u201d To save him face?", "This is a tricky one. NAH really- you can ask, but be prepared that your mum might decide not to go without him and there may be a family rift.", "NAH. The family that gives the invites should ask not you.", "NTA. But I'd bring the whole family in on talking to mom about how no one wants him here. Maybe mom doesn't know how much other family members dislike him and maybe she'll get a clue. Who know's how it'll go, but I say its worth a try.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I don't enjoy his company which she knows already since he is kind of a bully to me so, I thought maybe I'd bite the bullet and ask for myself and the family since most of them don't like him either.", "Man you really hit the nail on the head with this comment, I didn't really mention it in the post but he has a condo that he outright owns and rents out as well as a collector muscle car (mom is still paying off the condo we live in). So I know for sure he and his family isn't hurting for money. The only reason my family hasn't been able to confront him on his behavior before is that we live in different countries and well speak different languages. My family does speak some English but he always says he can't understand their accent, so my mom has always translated for him (I personally haven't seen him in person interact with the family since I haven't been able to afford to go back in 10 years though). Honestly overall though he ... isn't exactly subtle with his ugh ideas on people from other races if you know what I mean.", "NTA if you speak for yourself.\n\nthe opposite if you try to speak for anyone else.  if others feel the same, only they have the right to say it.", "Thank you so much! He also sounds like he's trying to make himself more than what he is, especially bragging about his kids who had social lives. Who cares. His kids had a life. He had nothing to do with it. With that being said, I feel for you, because I know what it was like to have a toxic person come to family gatherings who ruined them, every time. I have to say I'm glad your mom didn't move in with him, because she still maintains some independence from this guy. I'm sure it's rough on her financially, but she'll manage and with you around, she has someone who has her back. She really needs to get rid of this guy. He's no good for her. I'm sure she hears his nasty racist comments and knows the family doesn't like him. All those people can't possibly be wrong!! She would be better off alone than with miserable person who's a leech and a racist."]}
