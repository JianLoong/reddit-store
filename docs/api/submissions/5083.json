Every year, we hold a little soiree-type gathering at our house - there's usually 20-25 people who come. Nothing crazy.  It's a mix of coworkers, family, and friends. \n\nNormally, we do ALL the cooking for 25 people, and it sets us back about $500-$600 dollars at the grocery store. This year, with money being a bit tighter, we've added some \"stipulations\" to attending the party. On the invites that we mailed out, we added that guests need to bring a dish with them to the party if they'd like to attend. We listed some potential dishes that they can bring, or they can bring their own creation. If not bringing a dish, the alternative would be paying $20 per guest, to help offset food costs. \n\nOut of the 27 people we invited this year, there were 6 people (friends of my wife and I) who had an issue with this in particular. None of them ended up RSVPing and when my wife reached out, they said that it was selfish to expect a dish from guests, not considerate, etc. \n\nReddit, are we assholes for making guests bring a dish to our soiree?", "created_utc": 1671401846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zpa1he/aita_for_only_allowing_guests_to_attend_our/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t speak German, so that book will do me no good.\n\nBesides, different countries and cultures have different rules for things.", "I chose a reputable source.", "Lol\n\n\"You said something completly different but I asked for something that would be more relevant IMPlYING that it doesn't exist and try to discredit your point that way. Am I not allowed to do that?\"\n\n\nNo, you really are not allowed to do that in a conversation. But I would actually bet there is a guide to dinner parties but probably for hosts. \n\n\nYou can use google and the search function for dinner or guests.... honestly, if you are to lazy to google, fine. I gave you two sources. But if you are not capable or to lazy to use your eyes or the technology in your hand I honestly can't help you more. \n\n\nI substained my claim.", "NTA\nBut maybe your wording was poor?\n\nUsually we just call this \"potluck\".\nIf people don't bring food, there won't be enough to go around, and so it goes. But no one is put out, and no one has to sink hundreds of dollars into it... \n\n(But it also leaves room for the couple of friends that just can't to show up anyway. And at no potluck ever have I seen not enough food. Is it a risk? Sure. But a really small one )", "It seems like you should have just said \u201cIt\u2019s a potluck, let me know what you\u2019re bringing so I can help avoid duplicates\u201d and it\u2019s not a crazy request?? But specifying they have to bring a dish and suggesting what etc is a bit extra. When I was a student with little money I would bring some chips and salsa to share or a loaf of good bread from the bakery, these days if I\u2019m too busy to cook I might bring some beer or a couple bottles of wine as my contribution\u2026 there\u2019s many ways to contribute", "ESH - your friends for not OFFERING to help all these years and you for asking for money for guests you've invited to your home.\n\nThat said, I think I would have handled it differently than you did. Call the party a \"potluck\" and say \"Please bring a dish to share with all the guests.\" Now, you're gonna have some cheapos who bring nothing and still eat. Those folks don't get an invite next year. \n\nI can say I'd be really turned off by an invite that demanded food or money and would probably just skip the event altogether.", "YTA - you\u2019re hosting a dinner party. Probably better to encourage people to bring a dish than making it a requirement or making people pay. Also people commenting about potlucks. This holiday party isn\u2019t considered a potluck. OP if you cannot afford hosting a dinner party for 20-25 people then consider a smaller party or none at all. You\u2019ve changed your guests expectations, you shouldn\u2019t be surprised when they don\u2019t want to come.", "YTA. You are not really hosting a party if there is an entry fee. Should have just held a potluck.", "YTA. You couldn't figure out a way to make it fun?  I host an Oscars party to which every guest brings a dish/drink inspired by a nominated movie. I make the main course and a side or two and there's always a ton of food & drinks. Plus, it's a great way to get the party started. People get super creative and it's stupid fun. If I told people they had to give me $20 to come over, they wouldn't come, and their actions would be justified.", "NTA. Virtually every party people in our social circle throw is pot luck. Birthdays, Friendsgiving, holidays, you name it. Guests. Always. Bring. A. Dish. It is usually planned ahead. \"What do you need? \" Often the host will cook the main course but guests bring appys, sides, or dessert. They are also BYOB. \n\nAnyone calling such a party inappropriate in any way is the AH.", "Nta but you should word it more diplomatically ... like we've loved hosting you all over past years. This year money is tighter for us but we don't want to miss out on seeing our lovely friends for the holidays so we've decided to make our party this year a potluck! We hope you'll still join us and look forward to celebrating with you! \n\nGive some potluck dish suggestions. Drop the 20$ thing that comes across badly. If ppl can't cook everyone already knows to bring wine or drinks or a pre made dessert. \n\nThat comes across a lot more understandable and hospitable  than 'bring a dish or 20$ you deadbeats'", "Do those people ever reciprocate your hospitality?", "YTA. You aren\u2019t billing this as a potluck but as a party that people need to bring a dish too.", "\"people just want free food most of the time\"... Yea? Food, fun, and family/friends. You ever go to a Christmas dinner or friends party and complain about people coming for free food?", "The money doesn't even make sense because who is it going to? If 20 people are bringing a full tray of food, then it's not like OP has to put any extra time or money into making sure the last 7 people get fed. so that's $140 they just pocket under the guise of \"contribution\"", "The $20 doesn't make sense at all, considering there will be more than enough food if even half of the guests there bring a full tray of food. They don't have to do anything extra, they just pocket the money", "YUP, \n\u201cPotluck soir\u00e9e \u201c is a lot nicer than \u201cbring a dish or $20/person or you can\u2019t come\u201d", "That\u2019s when you bring beverages", "In college it was a common thing for me. Bring food or $5. If all the good brought wasn't enough to feed everyone the $5 was used for pizza. Anything left over rolled into the next party for general supplies too. Ice, plates, cups, napkins, etc.", "Then those six people can f\\*ck right off now and forever more.\n\nI can't image why anyone would consider this to be unreasonable. In addition, it's always fun to find out what other people bring and how good, or not, their cooking is.\n\nWe do this regularly with our group of friends and consider it normal.\n\nNTA but I'd ditch the six sourpusses", "NTA- I think it's pretty normal to bring something to a gathering even if the host(s) are providing the meal. I don't like showing up empty handed at least, even if it's something simple like a veggie tray to snack on, or something small for dessert. I do think you could've approached it differently. The invite should've been something like \"The theme for this year's party is 'potluck'. Please bring something to contribute\", and then ask everyone to let you know what they're planning to bring, so you can plan to fill in any gaps, or make suggestions. Or make some sort of sign up sheet.", "N T A for asking people to bring a dish but YTA for charging. Just host a potluck. Claiming it\u2019s a \u201csoir\u00e9e\u201d and then charging people is tacky.", "Depends on how you word it. \nWith costs whst they are right now, this year our party will be a pot luck. \nVs\nadmittion is with a bowl of potato salad or 20 per\n\nLots of room in between.\n\nWhat did you say", "NTA With the cost of food being so high right now, I can see how you wouldn't be able to host such a gathering this year without some assistance. It is not rude to turn your holiday party into a potluck event. You can choose what kind of holiday party you host and have no obligation to make it the same as those you have had in previous years.\n\nYour invited guests have the choice to participate in the party or they can choose not to attend.", "NTA! I think maybe just the wording. I always just ask people to \"bring a plate\" but I don't say entry will be denied if they don't. \nI love hosting but it is expensive and it sounds like you've been spoiling people for years with your generosity.", "Depends how you do it, in this case OP should collect money in advance by X deadline and then use it to buy more supplies/ mains. \n\nIf they collect after then your point stands. \n\nI think by assigning food or money you are also weeding out people who could contribute but don\u2019t want to/ are used to a free party / scabs.", "Mostly NTA.  I actually prefer potluck, it\u2019s fun.  However, for those who aren\u2019t a whiz in the kitchen, can they contribute in other ways like the bread, rolls, sodas, disposable plates, cups, etc?    Asking for money is YTA.", "Is there anyone on god's green earth who hasn't noticed the increased cost of food this year?", "There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to make me dip out of a party faster than being invited with *stipulations* and *entry fees.* But a potluck?? Love it, I\u2019m in.", "YTA - charging an entry fee for a holiday house party is pretty ridiculous and you come off as very greedy. If you require everyone to bring a dish or pay, you are going to end up with a shit ton of food (25 dishes is A LOT) and/or you are going to profit from hosting the party. If people bring their own food and others pay YOU, you are asking your guests to pay for your party while you also get paid for your party. Do you see how gross that is? Why not just call it a potluck and tell people to bring a dish if they can and let you know ahead of time so you can fill in the menu if needed? Even if only half the people bring food, that would be more than enough!", "YTA.\n\nDon\u2019t host if you can\u2019t afford it. God this is tacky AF.", "YTA. If you want a potluck, have a potluck. You are providing the entr\u00e9e, so why does there need to be TWENTY SEVEN other dishes?! That's insane. Even weddings I've been to didn't have that many dishes(including the entrees!!). You said you were expecting appetizers, which makes it even more insane. $200 worth of entr\u00e9es and then 27 appetizers?!", "NTA. Word the invitation as being a potluck, create a group chat where everyone can state what they're bringing, so that there aren't a lot of repeat dishes. \nWe usually do a bring a main, a side and a 2L drink per family.", "We are getting fucked at unprecedented levels by corporate greed in the wake of a pandemic who's long term economic impacts are yet to be felt. The system is designed to keep people struggling - we're going to have to get used to situations like OPs, previous social niceties simply arent affordable anymore.\n\nIf people don't want to pay, they don't have to come. It works out for everyone.", "That'd only be if you insisted on not bringing anything.", "But there are always those that bring a 2 ltr bottle of pop or a bag of chips. That ticks me off. I stopped doing potlucks at work years ago. You'd have these guys walk in and make big plates of food after bringing nothing. I could have had a nice steak meal out for the amount I spent on the food I brought.", "I feel like work is a little different than an event at someone\u2019s home\u2014but I know the guys you are talking about.", "NTA not selfish this is actually very smart. And as long as you aren\u2019t forcing people to make certain things they really can pick an easy dish.", "I\u2019m going with NTA because potlucks are common. Also asking people to pitch in money is also not unheard of either. The first Christmas party I went to that asked $20 a person was something I thought a bit strange at first but then I noticed how much effort the hosts put in and it isn\u2019t cheap.  And I\u2019ve since heard about other families that do it too. If they don\u2019t want to pitch in some money or make a dish then they don\u2019t have to come.", "NTA, I would be embarrassed to show up at any gathering without a dish!", "Why didn\u2019t you skip the cash bit and make it pot luck due to inflation this year. Something like \u201cwe love hosting the holiday party every year but this year things are just to tight with inflation so we are doing a potluck instead.\u201d \n\nEveryone is shorter on cash this year, they would have understood.", "NTA. Some people on here seem to be super uptight about this sort of thing. But some people are not. Let's just be real. Having a party is stressful and expensive. You are giving people the option to either bring a dish or to bring money to cover the cost of a dish. As long as you are not their boss where they feel obliged to show up, as that could be crossing the line.   \nOtherwise, it is giving people an opportunity to have a fun night together where they either bring some nosh or some dosh. Now, you would presumably need to ask them which option they choose in the RSVP for planning, because otherwise, that would be a headache. But it genuinely seems perfectly acceptable to me. If they aren't interested, they can decline the invitation.", "Your wording makes you TA.   All you needed to do was include a note saying that this year's event is a potluck and to contact you if they need ideas on what to bring.", "NtA\n\nNext time call it a Potluck and apparently that makes it cute and dainty.", "Yeh, I suspect OP got a bit overly official and transactional in the wording for so many to take offence.\n\nA polite request for people to bring a dish if they could usually goes down a whole lot differently.", "no bc we all bring food", "Better than 27 plates with deviled eggs.", "Event planning is not OPs forte", "Right, 5 bucks is fine. But this was also a group party versus a holiday party that is being hosted. 20 bucks per person is 40 for a couple. I would rather go out to a restaurant with my hubby for that price"]}
