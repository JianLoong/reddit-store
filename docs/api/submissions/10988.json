It's possible that she may not fully understand how you are feeling or may feel defensive about her choices, which could explain her reaction.*\n\n*It's worth having a further conversation with your wife to try to understand each other's perspectives and find a compromise that works for both of you. You could express that you support her excitement about the pregnancy and want to be involved, but would appreciate more variety in her Instagram posts. You could also express your concerns about sharing your child's face on social media and work together to establish boundaries around that issue.*\n\n*Overall, communication and compromise are key in any relationship, and it's important to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding for each other's perspectives.*", "YTA.
