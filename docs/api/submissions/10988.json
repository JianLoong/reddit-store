It's understandable that you may find it repetitive and tedious to constantly see posts about her belly, especially if you are away from home for long periods of time and want to see updates on other aspects of your family's life.*\n\n*It's important to communicate your feelings to your wife in a respectful and non-judgmental way, which it sounds like you did. However, it's also important to recognize that your wife has the right to use her personal Instagram as she sees fit and to share her excitement about her pregnancy in whatever way feels best to her. It's possible that she may not fully understand how you are feeling or may feel defensive about her choices, which could explain her reaction.*\n\n*It's worth having a further conversation with your wife to try to understand each other's perspectives and find a compromise that works for both of you. You could express that you support her excitement about the pregnancy and want to be involved, but would appreciate more variety in her Instagram posts. You could also express your concerns about sharing your child's face on social media and work together to establish boundaries around that issue.*\n\n*Overall, communication and compromise are key in any relationship, and it's important to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding for each other's perspectives.*", "YTA. Being pregnant and being home alone and/or just with the kids most of the time can be incredibly isolating, especially since you are admittedly not there most of the time. She's pregnant, she's only getting more pregnant, and Instagram is probably an outlet for her. So what is the actual problem here, and who is she hurting?", "YTA Let her do whatever she wants ots her life", "YTA. You haven't articulated a single reason for her to change her posting habits, other than \"I'm getting sick of seeing those posts.\" And that's not a good reason because, as your wife said, it's her social media page and nobody is forcing you to read it.", "YTA\n\nPick your battles.

I understand your concerns. But I have a question for you here. Was she like this during her earlier pregnancies as well? If not, why now? Is it possible that there is something going on here that you are missing? Is she feeling unloved or neglected during this pregnancy that she is turning to social media to get some validation? Usually people make a lot of fuss during a woman's first pregnancy while with subsequent pregnancies, the mom is pretty much on her own.

I agree that you have to work and there is nothing you can do about it. But sometimes during pregnancy, it is normal for a mom to feel a myriad of emotions.
