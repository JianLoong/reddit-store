It's possible that she may not fully understand how you are feeling or may feel defensive about her choices, which could explain her reaction.*\n\n*It's worth having a further conversation with your wife to try to understand each other's perspectives and find a compromise that works for both of you. You could express that you support her excitement about the pregnancy and want to be involved, but would appreciate more variety in her Instagram posts. You could also express your concerns about sharing your child's face on social media and work together to establish boundaries around that issue.*\n\n*Overall, communication and compromise are key in any relationship, and it's important to approach these conversations with empathy and understanding for each other's perspectives.*", "YTA.

If she's oversharing so much about the pregnancy and is very invested in her social media, it's likely she will overshare baby pictures and embarrassing stories etc. And Baby is NOT her body her choice. Baby is its own person who has a right to privacy and autonomy of their body/images just like everyone else and I don't give a flying fuck how young they are.\n\nSigned,\n\nMother of 2 who asks her kids before posting anything of them because they have rights", "My concern is different. \n\nI don't want my kid to be an Instagram baby/accessory. I think that they should be informed about the internet to the point that they are able to consent to have their pictures shared like that.\n\nThis behavior is a red flag for the kind of behavior I wouldn't want with the kid once it's born. \n\nIt's fine to be excited about the pregnancy. It's not ok to turn it into an accessory and eventually let it bleed out into how the child is treated.", "Oh fuck off. Being a supportive partner doesn\u2019t mean mindlessly defending outrageous public displays of one\u2019s body", "Yeah I think he's really unreliable and shady and YTA", "You can post pictures of your kids without their faces visible", "Except he was focused on how it bothers him, not her friends. He's the one who feels inconvenienced \ud83d\ude44 because she's not posting what he finds entertaining. He only mentioned her friends in passing and gives no indication of worry for her.", "The red flag is leaving your pregnant wife home alone for long stretches of time and then criticizing how she spends her time alone. Pregnancy is hard and scary as is and she\u2019s doing it alone.", "I read his previous post and it's so disturbing and disgusting????  \nWhy on earth would you want to associate that with your child in any way", "I wouldn't say this reflects on the wife at all. She's justifiably annoyed that OP felt the need to tell her he doesn't like her recent Instagram activity. Like, so what,  OP? Keep it to yourself. You don't need to rain on her parade.", "If a woman lives to 75 and has one baby, she only spends 1% of her life pregnant. They should take off their judgey pants and let her flaunt it in peace.", "Dude, she\u2019s not showing her boobs off. It\u2019s a baby bump. It\u2019s about as harmless as someone posting a million pictures of their cat.", "Next week:\n\n\"I just unfollowed my pregnant wife on Instagram. Now she won't speak to me. AITA?\"", "Yea, that would work perfectly --- when it's not you life partner lol", "Clearly they have been together long enough to know his work schedule before opting to have kids. \n\nI'm not saying that OP is NTA. But I'm saying that in OPs shoes this would prompt a discussion about social media and our kid. Hell I've already had that conversation.", "Right? The wife posts pictures of her pregnancy and the husband decides that he wants to control what she posts and they *both* seem immature?", "And after the friend said something nasty, her husband says \"Yes, all those photos of your body have been getting boring....\" \n\nShe must be devastated.", "Yes, if her friends are getting bored with it, they won't \"like\" the photos or they'll quietly unfollow for a while. \n\nBut I think a belly pic is pretty easy to scroll past. I'd rather that than a political rant or \"marketing\" some kind of product for sale.", "Right? So much mean subtext there. \u201cI find you boring as a mother. Be more interesting for me.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t stand one more photo of your pregnant body and neither can anyone else.\u201d \u201cI think this has gone on too far. Your judgment is flawed so now Dad needs to have a talk with you to put you back in your place being invisible.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re being a bit too confident with that body. On what ground? Do you think we want to see this? Gross.\u201d", "Yes, but that's not the point he's making here. It's a side note to him being bored with her pregnancy.", "If he was in a situation with child support obligations, they wouldn't begin until after the child was born.", "Then he can ask his wife for photos of the kids.\n\nNot to stop posting photos of herself because he thinks it's boring.", "Judging from what op said it doesn't seem like anyone is triggered. Her friends even left a nice comment with a joking tone. If they were triggered they'd sound more like, well, you.", "Again this is kind of a person to person thing. I would appreciate what he did but others can\u2019t handle constructive criticism.", "now hold up, not really jumping into the AH argument, but saying someone is posting something too much is criticizing them as a person is just ridiculous", "Most people don\u2019t appreciate unsolicited advice. That\u2019s all this is. Calling your partner boring is not constructive.", "Saying she is boring surly is. Your own husband? Yes, yes that is criticizing her as a person. What is too much? Are there secret rules? He\u2019s basically saying she\u2019s embarrassing, so yes, that is all quite personal from your spouse when she didn\u2019t ask his thoughts in the first place. Why care if she\u2019s happy with it?", "he didn't say she's boring, he said her feed is boring (stupid and rude thing to say, but not an insult to character).", "Christ, thank you. I\u2019m late 30\u2019s and pregnant, I have a hell of a lot better things to do with my time then pretend I\u2019m an influencer and bombard people who dgaf with my belly pictures. I also have a hell of a lot better things to do with my time than to gaf about how many belly pictures some other person posts. I can get behind OP on objecting to having a born child\u2019s face all over social media when the child is far too young to consent, but that wasn\u2019t the core of his complaint.", "Agreed", "How so?? I think people would vote the same way", "Are you for real? If he finds it so boring, he can stop looking. It isn\u2019t her responsibility to cater to him in this situation. It\u2019s her IG, she can post what she wants.", "Exactly this!", "But.. he also wants it to end because she may start posting a bunch of the baby in the future(like literally all my friends do).. but it sounds like the volume has increased on her Instagram, and honestly.. there are some people I could think of that are addicted to social media.", "It seems that the friend could have just \"massively\" praised the \"shot\" she liked. Positive reinforcement could have got more of the same.  Now if I was OP's Wife--I'd be posting more belly shots!   \nmaybe some of my swollen feet and any stretchmarks", "She's his wife? And she's carrying his child? You think a husband should care about what she does?", "I'm being sarcastic, but I obviously didn't make that clear enough. I agree with you.", "You're jumping on OP's choice of phrasing as evidence that he did not *suggest* but rather *ordered* her to tone it down, and you're doing so immediately after declaring OP to be an unreliable narrator.\n\nI'm not saying he's not the asshole, I'm just saying that the tone of his post suggests an unfortunate choice of phrasing in his original post rather than an actual demand for her to 'tone it down'.  For example, \"she's not really communicating with me.\" 'Communicating' is very much a term used by people in healthy relationships, because it makes a distinction between talking to someone and communicating your inner feelings with them; people in unhealthy relationships (such as controllers or abusers) would be more likely to say \"she's not talking to me right now\", because they *don't* make that distinction.\n\nAlso, never did he say anything about asking her to \"stop posting about her pregnancy\".  He said \"tone it down\", which means post *less* about her pregnancy, not stop posting about it altogether.  I think you're projecting your own ideas about OP's situation overtop of the actual evidence provided.  Granted, there's no way to verify the information provided, but it's all we have to go on here, so I believe it would be prudent to base our decisions on that rather than on the presupposition that he's a stereotypical asshole husband/boyfriend/fianc\u00e9 and subsequent viewing of the story through that lens.", "Lol wasn\u2019t sure but thanks for clarifying", "I can't believe real people actually care about who follows them on social media lol. So pathetic.", "I mean, as family and friends, you should probably suck it up and let the person do the harmless thing that makes them happy? It's not like they're getting stuck in a 30 minute conversation about her pregnancy every day, it's photos that you can scroll past in less than a second.", "He explained that he's had to work a lot and is not home a good chunk of the week. He enjoys looking at her instagram to see what she's been doing (not in a controlling manner) and what she's been doing with their kids. He obviously wants to stay connected to them and instagram is how he does it. It doesn't mean he doesn't know his wife. I follow my kids on instagram to stay connected with them and see what's going on in their lives. It doesn't mean I don't know them.", "I feel terrible for this elated pregnant woman because she\u2019s surrounded by fucking jerks. \n\nHow much of an asshole does friend have to be to give her a backhanded insult in a compliment? Can\u2019t just call her pretty? Tf. and why SIDE with this person as her husband? \n\nAlso big yikes on having a husband who *cares* what those people think. Grow up and support the woman **who may die** delivering your baby. (Seriously, do men not think of this outcome? It\u2019s very real. Let her be happy) Jesus Christ. Everyone is free to mute her if they want to.", "When someone thinks their wife needs to entertain him with their social media feed and that her documenting her pregnancy is boring, we're not really making \"assumptions\" that they're an asshole... we're just responding to what is written.", "Agreed! He wants her to change what makes her happy because he thinks it's too much and boring.   Let the woman do what she wants. It's harmless and says more about the people being bothered by it than her.  Criticizing what a pregnant woman posts on social media seems so petty and silly.", "To be fair, whenever someone I know gets pregnant, if their feed turns into belly pics and baby booties, I absolutely unfollow.", "answer the question and ill tell you.", "I know they do, reread my comment", "Legally he doesn't have to until it's born", "> 'consequences of her actions'\n\nAlthough you see it as harmless, regardless, there will be consequences to the actions.", "Policing what your partner posts on their social media about their pregnancy journey is not constructive criticism", "? not sure what you're attempting to say here?", "very mature, I wasn't even talking to you either", "Reread and comprehend.", "You quite literally were tho"]}
