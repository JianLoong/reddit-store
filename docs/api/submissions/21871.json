Your co-teacher needs to grow up. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  It would have never occurred to me to \\*not\\* do what you did.  It's a female student...get a female teacher to address the wardrobe problem with her so she isn't made to feel uncomfortable.  Duh?  That's just common sense.", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou know who's the asshole? Yeah, your partner teacher.   \n\n\nGood on you for BEING understanding.", "NTA; it used to be considered a matter of common sense to have a female staffer address such concerns as \"wardrobe malfunctions\" and anything pertaining to bodily issues with female students. Not sure what happened with the partner teacher but she needs to step up and realize her own personal discomfort at \"awkwardness\" is not as important as gently informing the student of the issue for benefit of the girl's well-being.", "NTA\n\nYour co-worker seems to lack basic empathy. Not everything is divided between your and her responsibilities. It would've been more embarrassing for the kid if you pointed it out. You're fine.", "NTA female teacher here. You have to protect yourself and your colleague needs to grow up and stop complaining. She doesn't sound like she should be doing this job if that's her response. \nI've had male colleagues ask me to address something like this hundreds of times.", "Why didn\u2019t your partner teacher do it then?", "NTA but you should report the incident sounds like she wasn't being empathetic to the student or doing here job which is to assist you that includes things like this , you are totally right you would've handled the situation yourself not only would've it been uncomfortable it would've been interpreted wrongly and rised some red flags either to the girl , her parents when she tells them or any other colleague that passed by or knew about it", "NTA. I really don\u2019t understand what the big deal was. All she had to do was discretely tell her \u201chey, your shirt is doing whatever it was doing.\u201d Obviously that would be better coming from a female teacher if it\u2019s a female student, both for the students comfort and to avoid any kind of possible misunderstanding that could affect your job/reputation. I\u2019m sure if a boy student was like poking out of his zipper or something she would ask you to address it. This just seems like common sense.", "NTA, you absolutely did the right thing. For the kids sake (I\u2019ve never been a middle school aged girl so I\u2019m guessing here) it\u2019s much better and more comfortable that the info came from the same gender. But also for your jobs sake, I understand you not taking the risk and going to a woman for help.", "NTA.\n\nIdealism aside, girls that age probably prefer talking to a woman about this. The important thing is that it was dealt with in the most tactful way possible.", "INFO: What kind of wardrobe malfunction? If no one else noticed it, was it really that big of a deal?

It seems like it was a delicate situation in which a male attending to it may have made her more uncomfortable.  Your partner teacher isn't thinking properly.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhen I was teaching middle school, a male teacher found me during an assembly to ask me to help a student having her period. I helped her find pants and get pads. The student was a lot more comfortable dealing with me because we both have periods. The male teacher was in his 50s. I don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. If you were by yourself, I would say you had to handle it. It is sometimes better to have teachers of the same gender as their students handle sensitive issues.", "You absolutely did the right thing.

As a rule any malfunction that can be easily fixed should be quietly pointed out. I don\u2019t know what your coworker\u2019s problem is but I agree with reporting this to your boss. You should also ask the boss for advice about protocol in these situations. This will not be last odd event"]}
