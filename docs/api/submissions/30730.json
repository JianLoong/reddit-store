They have used the other two nearer machines and there is some weird glitch or thing they do not like about them.\n4. The lighting in the room on the TVs or lighting coming from outside.\n\nThe fact is . . . the reason this occurred does not matter because it did NOT affect you.  There is no invisible buffer zone beyond personal space that extends outward as you seem to feel you are entitled to.  \n\nSure, just like when you are the first on the plane and you hope that someone picks a different empty seat rather than the one right next to you, inwardly, you can hope for that, and maybe even be annoyed when they choose the seat next to yours, ***but going so far as to express your annoyance through a passive-aggressive question is one entitled step too far.***\n\nYour roommates are right.", "Did I miss the part where you own the gym?

I\u2019m sweating my ass off trying to run off my beer belly and guilt from last night\u2019s steak and whiskey, and am not trying to stare at your ass while I\u2019m running.", "If they didn't want to be bothered, they shouldn't have chosen a spot right next to someone.\n\nThere are 2 people involved here, they need to see the other's perspective. If someone has some reason, justifying awkwardly choosing to work out right beside someone, late at night, when other spots were free, without introducing themselves, they need to see where the other person is coming from, especially if that other person is a girl, and the person going beside them is a guy. Do I need to remind you, or are you unaware that 1 in 4 women have been sexually assaulted?\n\nThe only way the OP gets to see where the guy is coming from is talking. Why is talking to someone such a big deal lol? If you literally go beside someone and then don't want to be bothered enough to answer a simple question, that is being an asshole x2."]}
