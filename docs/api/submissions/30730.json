They have used the other two nearer machines and there is some weird glitch or thing they do not like about them.\n4. The lighting in the room on the TVs or lighting coming from outside.\n\nThe fact is . . . the reason this occurred does not matter because it did NOT affect you.  There is no invisible buffer zone beyond personal space that extends outward as you seem to feel you are entitled to.  \n\nSure, just like when you are the first on the plane and you hope that someone picks a different empty seat rather than the one right next to you, inwardly, you can hope for that, and maybe even be annoyed when they choose the seat next to yours, ***but going so far as to express your annoyance through a passive-aggressive question is one entitled step too far.***\n\nYour roommates are right.", "Did I miss the part where you own the gym?

But I\u2019m a guy and I wouldn\u2019t have felt threatened.", "But then you would expect them to say, \"Oh, sorry, this is my go-to machine. Oops.\"", "I mean it feel deliberate. Like someone entering an empty bus but still sitting next to you.", "This one infuriates me more than the bus seat. I have a new car, so I will generally park far away at the grocery or box stores so that I have no one around me, and it also give me a chance to get some extra exercise. At least once a month I will find some weirdo parked next to me, with the next nearest car being 10 spots away. Someone doing that is doing so intentionally, either to be an asshole or because they have a screw loose.", "Okay but technically that can apply to you too tbf.", "What\u2019s really weird is when people in thrift stores get there after you and then start acting like they need to keep stuff away from you. Like, chill, Harold, I don\u2019t need a golf club that\u2019s seen better days and a Lake Compounce 2003 Smith Family Reunion tee that bad.", "Exactly!", "The treadmills are all pretty much the same in any given gym. You\u2019re definitely weird for preferring one over the other.\n\nIf you go to a bar and there\u2019s one person sitting among 15 empty seats, do you sit right next to them?\n\nYou may not be creeping but how would they know that?", "If it was the case of a favourite treadmill, they could've said that when asked. OP was curious why they picked that specific treadmill and wasn't an asshole for asking.", "It's very possible. But something I've now learned is that just because I feel a certain way about something, it may have occurred differently to someone else. I was very annoyed but honestly thinking through it, he likely just picked whatever without thinking about it. I think if it happens again I won't say anything and just quietly move to a different machine.", "That's sooooo sweet.", "that\u2019s some really, really bizarre logic. \n\nThey clearly went camping/hiking to a secluded area. Why the fuck would someone think they wouldn\u2019t want to be alone?", "I am a bit anti-social in the gym, and get bent out of shape when the furthest-out machines are taken. Give me my bike shoved-up-against-the-mirroed- wall any day.", "I completely agree as long as they are not being rude or creepy then there should be no issue", "I agree.", "My gym has 8 treadmills (two different kinds), 3 of these treadmills are better for people with long legs (i don't have long legs), that leaves 5 treadmills that i can use. And two of these 5 treadmills have sticky and smelly handles which i don't really want to use, so there are three treadmills left to choose. And i would rather use a treadmill next to somebody than one of the sticky treadmills but i also have no problem if somebody uses the treadmill next to me.", "BWAAAAHAAAA! We hope!! Also, OP, YTA", "Thank you, finally someone comparing this to the urinal rule because it\u2019s basically the same fuckin thing.", "Wait until OP runs a road race in public, lol", "Reminded me of Larry David.", "Yes", "Yes. She's there to work out. Leave her alone. Don't be a creep.", "Yes. Let women concentrate on their workouts and don\u2019t bother them. Especially if they have earbuds in and are obviously not looking to socialize.\n\nAnd someone working out at midnight like OP is DEFINITELY not looking to socialize with their workout.", "People like you are why women can't just relax and enjoy their time at the gym.", "Yes.\n\nWomen don\u2019t wanna be approached at the gym 99.9% of the time, let alone at fucking *midnight*. \n\nSincerely, \n\nA straight man with common sense.", "idk they were probably caught off guard bc it\u2019s not that big of a deal and they weren\u2019t expecting it lol", "They don't owe you an explanation", "Or sitting next to or in front of you in an otherwise empty movie theater.  It is super annoying. I agree with the OP.", "Or parking next to you in an otherwise empty lot.", "That's my take too.  And yet the responses I saw overwhelmingly didn't seem to see it that way, *or* didn't see anything wrong with that (not sure which).\n\nEDIT: Re-read, and since my initial scan of the responses, it seems more balanced now.  Whew.", "Why is it when you park far away it's so you aren't parked by a bunch of people and get to walk but anyone else that parks in the back is a weirdo and an asshole?", "Yeah, I hear you. I am the same when Im using my wife\u2019s vehicle , which has a handicap wheelchair exit. I park it far away (since im not carrying my son most of the time and dont want to use a free handicap spot if not needed) and 1 out of 3 times, theres someone parked super close to me. I just tell myself is a public space, and keep it moving, but it sucks you cant yell at these people to let them know of their annoying ways.", "They don't owe OP shit. Having curiosity does not mean OP is entitled to an answer.", "Honestly I didn't think it was necessary to ask the question. Hence the soft. And I blank people at the gym sometimes too. But then I've had a bad experience in a previous gym setting and I'm cautious because of it.", "Safety in numbers?", "I\u2019m not sure if you read the same post, but this person literally just jumped on the treadmill and minding their own business OP is the one that interrupted them.", "To most women, it's super creepy to have an open line of machines and have some random man use the machine next to them.\n\nWomen have learned to live in fear - men do outrageous hurtful and violent things at time. It's the stranger danger police tell you about as a small child dialed up to 50.\n\nThere's a book about it \"The Gift of Fear.\" If you don't understand, read the book. Most libraries have it - it was a bestseller.", "And they didn't have to chose the machine next to the only other person using a machine at midnight.", "And not to mention it was MIDNIGHT. Makes it even worse, gives really bad vibes. Very few people around, and they still choose the one right next to OP", "Not the one you replied to but when I did that, it was bizarre because not only was I far away, there was plenty of empty spaces around me, like plenty, and yet someone always just had to pick the spot right next to me. Like there are 30 empty spots of equal if not better distance that me, why the fuck did you choose to park next to me?? It's just weird", "I think the comment you responded to was more speaking generally than to this particular episode, since the person they responded to thinks it\u2019s fine to bother women working out to hit on them.", "as a woman I absolutely understand and agree with what you\u2019re saying, I said I\u2019d be uncomfortable too. but op never said they were a woman and the other person was a man, and didn\u2019t sound uncomfortable just curious why people do that. I think using a machine next to someone is relatively innocuous, they weren\u2019t even looking at or talking to op. If this happened to me id probably get up and move machines too.", "Exactly. This Ups the icky factor of it all.", "And you know that no one was parked in or near these empty spaces when you where inside? If go out looking for people that are \"weird\" you will find them because you only have your pov to base it off of, maybe to them they think it's less likely someone tries to break into their car if they park by someone else or any 100 other reasons that make sense to them. Try not to assume the worst of people."]}
