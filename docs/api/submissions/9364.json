I am also currently pregnant and due in April. \n\nWe have been chatting lately about what we might do for our honeymoon. We\u2019ve decided that we will be bringing our baby with us as it wouldn\u2019t be fair to leave him/her with family for a week or more and I\u2019m sure we wouldn\u2019t want to leave our baby for this long anyway. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has a 9yr old daughter from a previous relationship. She spends most of her time with her mother but comes to us for a weekend every fortnight. Myself and his daughter have a good relationship. She\u2019s a nice little girl generally, albeit a bit cheeky but I make a big effort with her and do my best to make her feel welcome and at home when she\u2019s with us. Honestly though I have no major bond with her, i don\u2019t feel any real love for her, no matter how much I try. That\u2019s just how I feel. But I am always kind/considerate towards her  and would never be mean or nasty to her. She does irritate me though from time to time and honestly, I am glad on a Sunday evening when she is going back home to her mothers. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 now wants to bring his daughter on our honeymoon also, seeing as we will be bringing our baby. He doesn\u2019t want her to feel left out. I do understand where he\u2019s coming from but I really don\u2019t want her to come. I know I won\u2019t enjoy the honeymoon half as much if she\u2019s there. She\u2019s not my daughter and I just don\u2019t feel fully comfortable when she\u2019s around. I wouldn\u2019t be able to relax in the same way. We\u2019ve had an argument about it now and he can\u2019t understand where I am coming from. He thinks that bringing the baby and bringing his daughter is the same thing and doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want her to come.\nI feel like I may come across as the asshole here, but I just want to enjoy my honeymoon !

Show her that she is part of the family, and let her pick what you do and call it a \"familymoon\".

She spends most of her time with her mother but comes to us for a weekend every fortnight. Myself and his daughter have a good relationship. She\u2019s a nice little girl generally, albeit a bit cheeky but I make a big effort with her and do my best to make her feel welcome and at home when she\u2019s with us. Honestly though I have no major bond with her, i don\u2019t feel any real love for her, no matter how much I try. That\u2019s just how I feel. But I am always kind/considerate towards her  and would never be mean or nasty to her. She does irritate me though from time to time and honestly, I am glad on a Sunday evening when she is going back home to her mothers. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 now wants to bring his daughter on our honeymoon also, seeing as we will be bringing our baby. He doesn\u2019t want her to feel left out. I do understand where he\u2019s coming from but I really don\u2019t want her to come. I know I won\u2019t enjoy the honeymoon half as much if she\u2019s there. She\u2019s not my daughter and I just don\u2019t feel fully comfortable when she\u2019s around. I wouldn\u2019t be able to relax in the same way. We\u2019ve had an argument about it now and he can\u2019t understand where I am coming from. He thinks that bringing the baby and bringing his daughter is the same thing and doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want her to come.\nI feel like I may come across as the asshole here, but I just want to enjoy my honeymoon !

I also get not wanting to leave your infant behind for a week or more. Perhaps a compromise is in order. Take a shorter honeymoon with just hubs and the baby.

Nowhere in this post did I get the sense he is a deadbeat.", "> Not sure why he could be judged as a deadbeat.\n\nBecause he's a man and this is AITA so people will just make up stuff to demonize someone they don't know.", "Sir, this is AITA", "My parents had the same agreement, they divorced when  I was 10 and my father also went to live somewhere around an hour drive. Even if I understood at the time that logistically it couldn't really be any other way, the fact that my father chose to do this (divorce+moving \"far\" away seeing me only 4 days a month+make another family) made me feel SO abandoned, that I still have mental health issues from it nowadays 27 years later :(\n\nI have never felt \"enough\" as a person, because  _my own father_ chose to leave me behind to start another family only seeing me 4 days a month, instead of trying to make it work with my mother for my sake or even just sticking around until I moved out, being unhappy in the process. He chose his own wellbeing and left me with a broken spirited woman who had 0 emotional availability until she got a health scare that reminded her that I existed, 5 years later. By then, I had learnt to be on my own and we still to this day haven't really have a very good bond.\n\nI'm super low contact with both of them, now.\n\nHe chose himself back then, and I'm choosing myself now. If that hurts him, it's just the consequence of his own decisions.\n\nHe wasn't a deadbeat father, yet he still abandoned me all the same.\n\nPeople shouldn't have children if they can't prioritise their needs above their own.\n\nAnd yes, I've been to therapy and I've communicated to my parents exactly why we are close to NC, in case anybody is wondering \ud83d\ude43\n\nAnd yes, I have a daughter of my own (which is what awakened all of this in me; I understand my father even *less* than before \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f).", "I was 13 when my parents divorced and with that divorce we all moved from the town I grew up in to the larger city about 30 min away, my parents decided that because my mom was in the better school district, we would live with my mom primarly seeing my dad one set day of the week (Wednesday's) and every other weekend. \n\nMy parents chose stability for my brother and I, but my dad was no deadbeat, he was at every sporting event/school function. My dad would have wanted more time with us, but that was what worked for our family.", "Exactly. Doesn\u2019t sound like a deadbeat dad to me.", "Four days a month put another way is every other weekend. Which is one of the more common custody arrangements when kids are school age.\n\nWhen the kids have to be near their school 20-23 days a month, it doesn't leave much time for parents to split for quality time. It's not like the primary custodial parent is going to agree to getting all the days where the kids are rushing to and from school and doing homework, but give up all the weekends and fun activities to the other parent.", "> 5 children he acknowledges \n\nDoes he have children he doesn\u2019t acknowledge?!?!", "Yeah, I mean my mom jokes that she\u2019s ready for the grandkids to go back to us parents after a few days.

I miss them so much!\u201d) \n\nEven that is way different than being overjoyed when a child leaves.", "And OP has a child, so she needs to step up her game. She can't bond with the step kid because she's cheeky and irritating? Guess what? Children are sometimes cheeky and irritating. Her kid will be too, as soon as it gains the faculties to do so. She needs to be a good caregiver regardless of how she feels. Some days, you are exhausted and distracted and not having fun, but you need to be there for a child and understand that it is your duty to do so. If she can't do that at all, she needs to start. If she can't do that for her step daughter specifically, she needs to change her mindset about being a step parent and fix that. Resenting the step daughter will bleed through into her interactions with the kid and that is not fair.", "Savage freeloaders \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I love it!!", "Roasted broccoli on pizza is amazing!

It is truly sad how selfish people can be.  I tried to keep the peace and told them to \"work it out\" to I guess salvage the little bit of time they had with their Dad. I finally stopped. My kids are 12 and 9, they are old enough to decide where they want to go and its up to the adult in this situation to spend time with them if he wants.

The state investigated his father- as a complicit offender to the mother's neglect- even though he had no idea and saw his kid regularly. Even then- his kid was sent to live with the Mom's parents and he had to fight.\n\nSo- no, when a father asks for custody, he usually has to fight for it. Did you perhaps mean \"Visitation\"?", "Lol white sauce with broccoli as a topping. I have never tried cauliflower on a pizza....usually they use that as a crust option"]}
