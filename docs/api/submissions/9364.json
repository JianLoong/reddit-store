I am also currently pregnant and due in April. \n\nWe have been chatting lately about what we might do for our honeymoon. We\u2019ve decided that we will be bringing our baby with us as it wouldn\u2019t be fair to leave him/her with family for a week or more and I\u2019m sure we wouldn\u2019t want to leave our baby for this long anyway. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has a 9yr old daughter from a previous relationship. She spends most of her time with her mother but comes to us for a weekend every fortnight. Myself and his daughter have a good relationship. She\u2019s a nice little girl generally, albeit a bit cheeky but I make a big effort with her and do my best to make her feel welcome and at home when she\u2019s with us. Honestly though I have no major bond with her, i don\u2019t feel any real love for her, no matter how much I try. That\u2019s just how I feel. But I am always kind/considerate towards her  and would never be mean or nasty to her. She does irritate me though from time to time and honestly, I am glad on a Sunday evening when she is going back home to her mothers. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 now wants to bring his daughter on our honeymoon also, seeing as we will be bringing our baby. He doesn\u2019t want her to feel left out. I do understand where he\u2019s coming from but I really don\u2019t want her to come. I know I won\u2019t enjoy the honeymoon half as much if she\u2019s there. She\u2019s not my daughter and I just don\u2019t feel fully comfortable when she\u2019s around. I wouldn\u2019t be able to relax in the same way. We\u2019ve had an argument about it now and he can\u2019t understand where I am coming from. He thinks that bringing the baby and bringing his daughter is the same thing and doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want her to come.\nI feel like I may come across as the asshole here, but I just want to enjoy my honeymoon !

Show her that she is part of the family, and let her pick what you do and call it a \"familymoon\".

She spends most of her time with her mother but comes to us for a weekend every fortnight. Myself and his daughter have a good relationship. She\u2019s a nice little girl generally, albeit a bit cheeky but I make a big effort with her and do my best to make her feel welcome and at home when she\u2019s with us. Honestly though I have no major bond with her, i don\u2019t feel any real love for her, no matter how much I try. That\u2019s just how I feel. But I am always kind/considerate towards her  and would never be mean or nasty to her. She does irritate me though from time to time and honestly, I am glad on a Sunday evening when she is going back home to her mothers. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 now wants to bring his daughter on our honeymoon also, seeing as we will be bringing our baby. He doesn\u2019t want her to feel left out. I do understand where he\u2019s coming from but I really don\u2019t want her to come. I know I won\u2019t enjoy the honeymoon half as much if she\u2019s there. She\u2019s not my daughter and I just don\u2019t feel fully comfortable when she\u2019s around. I wouldn\u2019t be able to relax in the same way. We\u2019ve had an argument about it now and he can\u2019t understand where I am coming from. He thinks that bringing the baby and bringing his daughter is the same thing and doesn\u2019t understand why I don\u2019t want her to come.\nI feel like I may come across as the asshole here, but I just want to enjoy my honeymoon !

You don't have to do much anything, the baby doesn't have to be entertained like a 9 year old has to be. You can eat whatever because the baby only has milk or eats babyfood anyway.

I also get not wanting to leave your infant behind for a week or more. Perhaps a compromise is in order. Take a shorter honeymoon with just hubs and the baby.

There are SO MANY factors that go into it. You can\u2019t just slap a label on a dad as a deadbeat solely based on their custody arrangement.", "I\u2019m a divorced parent and more importantly I *work* at Family Court, and at least in our state joint custody and an equal timeshare is literally the definition of \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d, and that is usually what judges strive for unless there are specific reasons not to - like safety issues by either parent or too big of a distance between residences (and even with the distance judges will try to balance it by giving the non-custodial parent during school time more of the non-school times like summer break).\n\nEdit: \u201cConsistency\u201d is anything that you are doing on a regular basis; there is absolutely no reason that a child would not have consistency with an equal timeshare schedule like 2-2-5-5 or week on week off. Parents just have to be on the same page and do good coparenting for it.", "Dig that hole lol", "This is not true as a blanket statement and I have three kids. \nAfter going through the baby stage 3 times, older children are MUCH easier to care for. They can do a lot by themselves, even at 9, do not rely on me guessing what they need because they can talk, and generally are much easier to entertain. Idk if you got lucky and had a super easy baby but all of mine had a habit of staying awake for damn near 42 hours with very small naps in between. There\u2019s a reason why new parents burn out so quickly and there\u2019s a reason why sleep deprivation is a real thing w when caring for new norms.", "Maybe because you knew that they had a fucking kid to begin with and decided to proceed anyways?? This is why step-parents are depicted as evil, trope exist for a reason", "I didnt say your opinion was right or wrong. In fact I didnt even share my opinion.\n\nIm just saying that the comparison you made is a fallacy. It's kinda fun to spot them. It can ruin the best argument.\n\nHave to work on the reading comprehension skills.", "Because they know what they signed up for, that\u2019s why.", "You knew your partner had parents when you met them. WHY DONT YOU AUTOMATICALLY LOVE THEIR PARENTS?!?!\n\nLOL Silly kids pretending they know the first thing about parenting or stepparenting.", "If you can explain how it's a fallacy, you would have a point. As of now, it's clear you don't understand the definition of a logical fallacy.\n\nParent = immediate family member. \n\nChild = immediate family member.\n\nIf it's impossible to automatically form a bond with parents and siblings of your spouse, the actual fallacy is claiming you can magically form these bonds with a child.", "Lollolololol"]}
