NTA. Parents should respect their wishes. There is nothing \u201ctoxic\u201d about it. I\u2019ve never had children, but I\u2019ve heard newborns can be exhausting.

Nothing pisses me off more than people feeling entitled to visit a new baby as soon as it\u2019s born.", "NTA. Please continue to keep your parents in check and help protect your brother's and wife's sanity.", "NTA. Your parents are being so melodramatic. It's TWO WEEKS. It's not like they're cutting them out of their grankid's life forever.", "It\u2019s two weeks, a lot of people go 2-3 months before allowing visitors.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a totally reasonable boundary for your brother and his wife to set. I suspect that your parents may be the toxic ones (and that this is at least part of why your brother and his wife are setting that boundary!). And you\u2019re being a great brother for backing him up.", "NTA Babies are not loaves of bread, they have no expiration date. Your niece or nephew will be just as cute at two weeks old as immediately after birth.\n\nYour parents should realise that if they want a good relationship with their grandchild they need to have a good relationship with the grandchild's parents. The fact that they are throwing a hissy fit over something as small as waiting for two weeks shows that they need to learn how to respect boundaries.", "NTA. Parents have every right to decide how they want to welcome their child into the world, as well as give mom a chance to recover.", "NTA. They will be absolutely exhausted. She will have gone through a massive physical trauma, and need time to heal (whether due to vaginal tearing or c section). Also, new born babies need feeding all the time... they will not have had proper sleep. They'll be trying to acclimatise. \n\nAlso, they might just want some time as their own little family for a bit and that's ok too. Why are other people making it about them?", "NTA. You are right to support them. Your dad is being unreasonable.", "NTA. Visitors can be both emotionally and physically draining. If the new parents want time to bond with the baby and settle in before receiving visitors, that's their choice. It's a reasonable choice, and not at all toxic.\n\nThe only toxic behavior here is from your AH parents.", "NTA Nobody saw my newborns until they were 3 months old. My oldest son was born with a small hole in his heart and I wasn't taking any chances with his health. Then after 3 months he was babitized per my mother's request..\nAnd my family respected my wishes. \nNow all babies born we wait 2 to 3 months after birth out of respect.  We normally see the child on thier babitism.", "NTA. It is 100% the parents choice of when or if someone is allowed to meet their baby. No one is entitled to meet them and this includes the grandparents. They are just pissed that you agree with your brother and SIL and taking their anger out on you.", "NTA. Two weeks is bare minimum in my book. I\u2019m planning closer to 6.", "2 weeks is much less than what people usually try to stick with. Normally this post comes with a 3-4 month timeline on it.\n\nPersonally it seems weird to make these kind of arbitrary rules as first time parents because you simply do not know what kinda help you are going to need and it's great to be able to call upon family and friends in that early period.\n\nNTA.

Your brother is lucky to have you having his back, and your attitude here in supporting them will likely come in very helpful in future!  It may not be your responsibility to deal with family drama, but having a third party point out when your parents are being unreasonable, will be so valuable to them.

No one wants to play host when they just pushed a human out of them, and haven't slept thru the night for 3 days (technically not even after just 2 weeks).", "NTA. My dad didn\u2019t meet my son until about two-four weeks later and I\u2019ll probably do the same with my baby on the way. Mom will be tired and healing and baby will be adjusting to life outside the womb and very sensitive to germs. Your parents are the toxic ones for trying to force people to do something they\u2019re not comfortable doing.", "NTA. Thank you for supporting them in this. Those first couple of weeks can be rough! If the parents want to help then they can order groceries from a distance or something. Let them settle in those first days!", "NTA and THANKYOU for supporting your SIL and Brother\u2018s request and respecting their boundaries. Your father is an AH for his reaction though. We see too many Grandparents on here who think they have a right to someone else\u2019s child. It\u2019s ridiculous. We see MILs who demand to be in delivery room and throw tantrums when told no, we see the famous old Lawn Tantrum when they turn up uninvited and the new parents enforce their boundaries and tell them to beat it. The only people who have a right to a child are that child\u2019s parents and it\u2019s about time some grandparents got that through their head.

A lot of parents are waiting longer than normal because this season has been so bad for illness. I hope you can encourage your parents to quarantine before they visit.", "NTA. A few months is also going to be the height of winter, the height of cold and flu season, and the projected height of the next COVID surge if you are in the states. \n\nTaking two weeks to not only settle in, get adjusted to having a tiny life dependant on you, not sleeping, trying to develop a new routine, and limiting disease vectors in their home? More than reasonable. Were it me (and that ship has long sailed) I'd go 2 months.", "NTA. Honestly I think 2 weeks is already them anticipating this reaction, with COVID and RSV and flu all being what they are right now 2 weeks is very much on the low end of what I've been seeing", "NTA. Good on you for sticking with your brother and you SIL. I\u2019ve had 4 kids and entertaining people as soon as baby comes home is awful. Getting the time to adjust to being home, healing, and enjoying those early moments of bliss is so much more important than hurt feelings.", "NTA. I also did not want visitors for a few weeks after having my kids. Luckily that wasn't a problem with my oldest three and youngest due to our families being spread out (military). We were within two hours of family when we had #4 but I still didn't want visitors until he was 2 months. My youngest was almost 2 years old before any family saw her in person. The joys of having family stationed on different continents.", "Nta", "NTA those 2 weeks allow them to bond and get settled at home with the baby plus the mum needs the time to rest and recover. She's not going to want to host people she'll likely be on bed rest/restricted movement no matter if it's a v or c birth. Plus she'll likely be having baby blues and be a hormonal wreck so she needs time for her mental health too.  Plus her partner will need his own time for his mental state.", "NTA. Two weeks \u2260 Two Years\n\nThey\u2019re not gonna miss major milestones in 2 weeks, plus your parents didn\u2019t birth this baby. Your SIL did, and it\u2019s your brother and your SIL\u2019s decision on how they want to spend time with their first born.", "Unfortunately not telling them the baby has been born might be the best way to go, but could also cause more drama. Guess it\u2019s up to what the brother and his wife would prefer to deal with.", "Two months is actually a normal amount of time to wait too. Gets those first vaccines in.", "It do be like that. I know people who say \"My baby is turning 38 months old this year\"\n\nbtw i completely agree, the grandparents just gotta accept its not theyre choice.", "It's also them finding their feet in a new routine as parents without having to worry about unwanted feedback about how they do it.", "Sometimes you know that your family won\u2019t be helpful, then it makes a lot of sense to limit them!  I know someone who has already just about demanded that I *will* be there when their someday baby arrives, (in a few years). They know I\u2019ll be helpful, and will keep my mouth shut when mouths should be kept shut, and although I may offer suggestions, they will be only ideas, because I have experience (both personally and through education from volunteer work I used to do), and I\u2019m likely to offer multiple, mutually exclusive suggestions on a single problem so they can choose among them and anything else they can dream up, and I\u2019ll support their decision.   It\u2019s amazing how this attitude gives you more access to a baby!  But, if anyone I know (and this family, should they change their mind), wants to keep the baby isolated with them for a time, it\u2019s THEIR decision.", "If they had the means to do it, they could have a room for two weeks so the parents can see them rough after they \u201cget out\u201d of the hospital. \n\nBut knowing healthcare prices in America, the only person who could do that might be Jeff Bezos.", "NTA"]}
