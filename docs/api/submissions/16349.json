She has three kids (20f, 19f, 17m.) Her ex-husband abandonded the family almost immediately after the youngest was born.\n\nI like and get along with all three of her kids really well, but her son (let's call him Jake) and I have especially formed a good connection.

I'm going to \\[my friend's house\\] with most of my other buddies and co-workers for poker night.\"\n\nShe seemed a little annoyed but said \"Fine, but then will you at least bring Jake along with you?\" I told her that we drink a good bit and some of us smoke cigars and we get a little rowdy and probably somewhat inappropriate. She said \"Well obviously don't allow him to drink or smoke but he should hang out with some guys being guys. He grew up without his father and it would be good for him.\" But I just didn't want to bring him along.\n\nI admit that part of the reason why is because I just wanted to hang out with my buddies and have fun without having to worry about being a role model for Jake. But I also just think that this sort of environment isn't appropriate for a teenager. It's not horrible, or anything, but our guy's nights are for adults.

He can't drink, he can't smoke, and I'll be honest, I imagine it'd be uncomfortable for everybody involved to have a kid at a Guys' Night unless he's used to hanging out with older guys and already has a feel for the kind of things that can and cannot be said when shit-talking.", "NTA. She's not thinking about this clearly. He's an underage kid, you're his mum's bf. It would be awkward for everyone involved. While its ok she wants him around \"guys being guys\", your guys night is not a time for babysitting a teen. He gets fishing trips and other things you mentioned. Insist that this is not the event, especially because your friends aren't bringing their kids too. That would be unfair to them.", "NTA.\n\nEven biological father's wouldn't bring their teenage sons to an adult guys night. \n\nBut especially NTA as you got together when the kids were already grown, you're not obligated to form a father/son bond beyond what you (and he) are comfortable with.\n\nSounds like you're doing plenty with him already.", "NTA.  Even in relationships there needs to be some independence.  It sounds like you do a good job bonding with him over activities already.", "NTA  . that is no place for a teenager. maybe u can hang solo with him another day . bowling? fotball? cinema ,,, etc", "NTA\nYou shouldn\u2019t be forced to invite her son to your guy\u2019s night, if you feel like it might be too inappropriate for him. And still, if his mom wanted Jake to have fun with \u201cguys being guys\u201d, he probably has friends his age too, and me being almost the same age as him, I can confirm there are certainly many fun people that are just as \u201cguys\u201d as adults.\n\nNot saying that his mom is an asshole though, I understand her wanting to spend some father-son time, but as you stated earlier, you already do a lot for him, which is very honourable.\n\nYou\u2019re a good father. Keep on going!", "NTA. It's real inappropriate. He's 17 he doesn't have your and friends' life experiences so he won't get the short hand conversations, jokes etc. Besides, he's 17 do you really think he's *not* gonna try to get his drink on? \n\nAlso you can have ONE day out of the week to yourself geez.", "NTA. I'm pretty sure your mates wouldn't approve of him being there anyway. There are other things you can do to bond but this isn't it.", "NTA, not wanting to get inebriated in front of a child you are trying to be at least a little bit of a role model to is a good rule.\n\nFunny sidebar, I witnessed the \"parties\" my \"dad\" and his drunk ass sexist friends had from a young age and it did nothing to improve my development into a Real Men(tm), it just gave me more shit to overcome.

She is though, for suggesting you bring her child when hanging out with your friends.", "NTA. It's not up to her who you include in your guy's nights, and I really don't think she understands what guys nights like that are like. I agree with her that he eventually needs to hang out with men being men on their own, but it sounds like you're doing that with fishing and offroading and golfing. I'm sure you could organize more time where your guy friends go fishing or offroading and show the kid a fun time with the guys in a diffeerent setting, but poker night is your night to let loose and not worry about being a role model for a night.", "NTA this is an adult night out and you're right it's not appropriate for a teenager. This night is also about you being able to cut loose which you can't so with Jake around. Maybe you and your friends can do something Jake can join in on at a later date.", "He's underage.

Wait until he\u2019s older when it\u2019s more appropriate. He\u2019s still a baby. Not even old enough to drink and an adult environment as you described won\u2019t really be beneficial to him.", "Jake is 17.... did he even want to go with you? I can\u2019t imagine it would be fun for him. \n\nFishing, golfing, etc is all fine... poker night with bunch of old guys?

You could organise a more teenage friendly guy time separately if that\u2019s what he\u2019d like.

He'll never want to go again.\n\nBut I'm struggling to work out why a 17 year old will want to hang out with a bunch of blokes in their 40's.  Surely he has some friends he'd rather spend the night with.", "NTA \n\n...BUT you need to get used to the idea that a strict and inflexible Saturday night appointment won't be agreeable for a long term relationship especially when kids are in the picture.", "NTA but...\n\nIMHO it's a mistake to shelter kids totally from booze and the like and then throw them in at the deep end at college or 21 and wonder why they drink to excess.  Much better to ease them into it, to see and be part of alcohol being used in a sensible environment.  So I'd start considering just when you *might* start bringing him along. Not every week, sure. Also don't discount the bonding: if he WANTS to spend time with you at 17, then do so, because soon enough he won't want to, especially if you turn him down for opportunities to do so. I'm not saying he gets a shot of jack and a Corona Corona, but one beer wouldn't set him on a path to perdition.", "NAH. You\u2019re only a year and change into your relationship. So you have some decision to make k think. She wants you to take on a fatherly role to her kids it seems. Do you want that? If so, maybe split the difference and setup a different guys activity Take her son on- camping, kayaking, etc. you already do that with him one on one it sounds like so invite your friends to come along. I don\u2019t see why he needs to come to poker night when he can\u2019t drink, smoke or gamble tho", "NTA but maybe you should explain what boy's really do during boy's nights (like rating and commenting sex partners, sharing best/weird porn videos, etc.. ) with that in mind, not sure she will ask you to take her son with you ;-)", "~~NTA.~~  NAH. I mean no means no, she might as well take that. She may be right though that it would not hurt for Jake to hang out with a couple of older rowdy men that are having \"inappropriate\" conversations, i mean its not like he is 12, he is going to be 18 in a year, so almost an adult. On the other its your own time and if you want a break from worrying about being a role model you take that break.", "YTA just tell her the truth that you want to do something with your friends alone.

Very odd demand.", "NTA\nHe's still a kid. You're an adult hanging with other adults. You want to let loose and be yourself without being in parent mode.

I'm glad your dynamic is mostly good.", "But still would be NTA in that situation too IMO. Sometimes you need to break. It's not a break as in getting rest, but to get a break from your daily grind, be in a different environment, receive new input and experiences. OP may not get that if he brings the daily environment and responsibilities with them.\n\nIt even goes beyond OP. Maybe the group of friends have worked up a level of trust and comfort to be like themselves and share thoughts and feelings, or act and unwind in ways they don't get to do elsewhere/everywhere.

I sincerely hope that by the time my youngest is 17 both my husband and I feel free to go out alone or together on a Saturday night haha. The kid is an adult in a year, what seventeen year old even wants to go hang out with a parental figure on a weekend haha", "Does the kid even want to go? Like why is the Mum insisting on this at all?", "Really? They're not even kids. The youngest is seventeen?", "Why is that? I am married but still have my boys night outs weekly to this day.", "Agreed. Tbh this is a bit of bad advice, but I mean this is reddit why not. Take him to a boys night, but try and structure it in a way that the kid doesn't wanna come again. Problem solved. By structure I mean, make it boring as hell for him", "Also weird to try force a parent/child relationship when all the children are basically adults.", "If this is how your boy's nights go, you hang around awful people. Most men don't sit around sharing weird porn and rating women.", "It also depends on the kid too. Like my dad used to get rowdy once in a while and had some wild buddies who just let er rip and didn't care who was in the room. My dad took me along a couple times to meet these guys cause he knew I was already kinda rowdy and not offended by anything. My brother was always more quiet and reserved and that wasn't his scene so dad never took him around that environment cause he knew he wouldn't like it. OP knows best here", "bro is 17 , surely hes got something to do on a saturday night.", "Yup, this \\^\\^\n\nTat's why te girlfriend is confused saying she gave her approval, she's the one who gets to decide what is appropriate for her son and OP's moral objections don't really work as an excuse at that point. OP should just come clean and give his real reason for not taking him.", "He\u2019s allowed to not want to take a minor to a poker game.", "Very much agreed, but I'm just saying, I could understand bringing Jake if he was grown and had been invited but not in the current situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think Mom understands that a Guy's Night isn't really a place for kids.", "I'm talking unforeseen circumstances such as death in the family, going away for weddings, funerals, providing comfort in difficult times or unexpected responsibilities like taking care of a relative. Essentially being flexible like I said.", "Oh have you never given up even one of those nights that involve only you and not your spouse? You are seriously telling me that no family events, weddings, birthdays, funerals, comforting someone in hard times or any responsibilities have even stopped you from going on your lads night?

That's not really how it works.", "I don't think she truly understands what kinds of things are said or done at the guys nights, so how can she approve of what's appropriate?

OP is unwilling to be flexible in anyway which shows a lack of compassion. Hopefully they will let their other half go find someone who will treat them how they deserve.", "OP clearly states Saturday night is lads night.

I'm unsure what about OPs post indicated a serious reason why he couldn't go? Why on earth would he have to take the kid? There is literally no reason for him to do so.\n\nAnd I'm not saying this as a dude who is trying to preserve 'boys night' or anything. I'm a Mum. And I don't understand how not taking a seventeen year old out to drink is lacking compassion.\n\nHe's not this kids father.

He didn't go to 'boys nights' with my Dad until he was 24 and they were working together/had mutual friends.", ">This clearly indicates OP feels this time is the most important thing in their life,\n\nNo, just that they enjoy some free time on Saturday. OP never said anything about abandoning their duties elsewhere. Only that this is a normally scheduled activity.", "Lacking compassion was aimed at the general principle of OP being inflexible about lads night, it's just foolish in a long term relationship.", "You guys all need to chill, I shared my opinion. A shout down wont change that, maybe try someone else?", "But we don't know if this is a consistent issue or anything? If she was surprised he was doing this on Saturday and had to ask - it's clearly not what he does every single Saturday. She's a grown ass lady with grown ass kids. I honestly feel she's the one being inflexible by getting passive aggressive about this.", "Please note my post says NTA, the rest was about being inflexible to ever miss a lads night.", "All we have is OPs post, that is what I commented on.", "But he doesn't really have a reason to miss this one?\n\nNot wanting to take his stepson is zero indication that he won't cancel if there ever is a reason?", "Dude, this is going around in circles just let it go that I don't agree with you. Not everyone will agree with you in life."]}
