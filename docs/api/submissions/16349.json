He can't drink, he can't smoke, and I'll be honest, I imagine it'd be uncomfortable for everybody involved to have a kid at a Guys' Night unless he's used to hanging out with older guys and already has a feel for the kind of things that can and cannot be said when shit-talking.", "NTA. She's not thinking about this clearly. He's an underage kid, you're his mum's bf. It would be awkward for everyone involved.

Much better to ease them into it, to see and be part of alcohol being used in a sensible environment.  So I'd start considering just when you *might* start bringing him along. Not every week, sure. Also don't discount the bonding: if he WANTS to spend time with you at 17, then do so, because soon enough he won't want to, especially if you turn him down for opportunities to do so.

Make sure you\u2019re making time for her too", "NTA \n\nA 17 yo doesn't need to be at a party like that.", "NTA - your gf needs to layoff", "NTA that wasn't a night for underage children. Gambling, smoking, and drinking. Your wife is completely unreasonable here. She obviously doesn't trust you so she sends her kid to tag along. I doubt a 17 year old wants to hang out with a bunch of 40 year old men.", "NTA. Jake is not a man - that is not the place for him. There are better things to do with boys this age.", "NTA", "NTA at all! You made a responsible decision!", "NTA...boundaries. Guys night is just that, GUY'S NIGHT! Time to let loose and talk shit with the boys, not fucking babysit.", "NTA.  Not every event, party, etc. is kid appropriate.  This is a guys night out with your ADULT friends who will be smoking and drinking, etc.  No, he's not a baby but he's not your adult friend either.  I know when I attend an adult type of party - such as poker night - I DO NOT want a minor there.", "NTA. Guy's nights are not for kids or teenagers. It was unreasonable. You do other very age-appropriate things with him, and this just wasn't an appropriate place to bring him.", "NTA. This is not a father-son moment, this is a mate-mate situation. Jake will eventually form a group of friends, if he doesn't have one already. He will drink and smoke and curse his arse off on his own guy's-night-out.", "**NTA** \\- I would not bring my son into such a situation either.", "NTA, you wanted a break, and you deserve one.\n\nMy first thought is that she is insecure about your guys' night and wants to send her son to make sure you 'behave'.", "NTA\n\nCall Jake a \"son of a bitch\" in front of his mom, and when she flips, tell her you're just preparing him for Saturday night since that's just \"guys being guys\"...jk\n\nbut do make her realize you're not just sitting around watching the sports game on TV, you're also talking about adult things that Jake isn't supposed to be around for. Also, you might be willing to compromise, but it wouldn't be fair to the other guys to have a 17yo drop in on their night out and now they all feel like they have to censor themselves for the child in the room.", "YTA for thinking drinking and smoking is \"inappropriate\" for a damn 17 year old boy. He probably drinks and smokes more than any of you. Americans and their puritan nonsense are cringe AF.  The young man is an adult on 95% of planet earth. You're acting like he's 13.", "NTA. Seems like you have the \u201cmanly\u201d activities covered with fishing, camping, golfing, whatever and you two spend some good time together. He wouldn\u2019t be scarred for life to hang out with some guys drinking and playing cards but would he even have fun?  I\u2019ve been in those situations and while I appreciated the inclusion, I just sort of sat there, laughed at a few jokes and watched the clock tick until we could go. Sounds boring for him and uncomfortable for you, OP.", "NTA\u2026 this is bizarre", "\"Since she gave her approval.\" Excuse me? You're a grown man - you don't need your SO's permission to have a night out with your friends, any more than SHE would need YOUR permission to go out with hers. It's one thing if you're out with the guys all the time, but it sounds like this is something you don't do very often. Don't get into that mindset - I've watched too many relationships crash and burn over arguments about an occasional girls/guys night.", "NTA I doubt your buddies would love it either, it would change the whole dynamic and you all would feel you have to be on your best behaviour instead of having a relaxing let loose with buddies, sounds like you do plenty (more appropriate stuff with him anyway)", "NTA  but you could've used a bit more tact.  First you should ask your friends if it's ok. I mean they also need to adjust their behavior. Second, would Jake even want to sit around with a bunch of old guys talking about stuff he doesn't care about, with some corny jokes he doesn't like?  \n\nAs a compromise, suggest he can come along when he's allowed to drink.", "Nta", "NTA, OP.\n\n1. It would not be an appropriate place for her minor son.\n2. It would likely not be fun for him, nor fun for your friends to have him there (and not fun for you to have to keep him in mind).\n3. It was strange for her to ask. You do plenty of things with her son that are in the vein of father-son activities. Even if you were his father, this would not have been an appropriate activity for him at this age. Does she imagine that \"real fathers\" introduce their sons to smoking, drinking, gambling, and (not saying this was part of your guys night - women)?\n4. Even if your evening plans were appropriate for her son, she completely discounted your need to have some 'you' time with your friends.\n\nI'd ask her why this mattered so much to her, to understand where she is coming from. Hopefully, she'd also listen to you, to understand why she was asking too much of you.", "NTA you don\u2019t have to; it\u2019s your time. Plus it\u2019s inappropriate. \nMaybe arrange a more suitable guys night/day?", "NTA. Drinking,  gambling,  smoking,  probably not a place to bring a 17 year old to. Sounds like you're a pretty good dude to the boy. If anything,  your gf is the AH here for trying to subject her underage son to an obviously adults only gathering.", "Nta you are right it\u2019s not a child friendly activity. She wants him to be around gambling, alcohol and smoke?! Smdh I think she misunderstands what guys being guys means - and that\u2019s sad.\n\nImho you\u2019re a good role model by being able to tell the difference, hopefully she will listen to your male advice (given that\u2019s what she is seeking for her son).", "NTA - you need a break, and you'd be \"on\" as a parent if Jake were to attend. And maybe the rest of the guys wouldn't feel as comfortable having a kid there, too, and y'know what? Kids pick up on that shit. It would be worse for Jake to tag along and feel unwelcome.", "NTA", "NTA. Jake is still too young to be around grown ass men who drink, smoke and have adult conversations with no filter. You are not Jake's babysitter, and you have more morals and ethics than your girlfriend concerning minor children. Jake isn't a fully grown man yet. Also, your friends and your co-workers probably don't know Jake and should be able to enjoy themselves and relax fully without an underaged newbie in the mix. I would be concerned with how your GF feels that it's okay for her son to be in such a situation and that she feels that it's okay to butt into your plans.", "NTA - Obviously not an appropriate place for him and everyone deserves nights to themselves. In an attempt to compromise I might suggest having some of those exact people join in on fishing trips or off-roading adventures. The whole being around \u201cguys being guys\u201d part would be fulfilled, but in a more appropriate, inclusive environment.", "NTA. Adults need to have adult time with friends too, and bringing a kid will change the dynamic of the group, what is not fair for others.", "NAH. You're entitled to your freedom, and your gf is just looking out for her son, with a man she trusts, in a manly but safe environment. Normal for her to ask, and depending how serious you two get, you'll probably be asked to do so again. You're already a good guy for doing so many other things with Jake, one on one, so cheers to you for that. And like I say, you're entitled to your freedom (although if every Saturday night is boys' night, you're going to run into some legitimate friction with your gf doing forward).", "NTA. Your girlfriend is being unreasonable. As a women it's not okay that she's making a problem of you having a guys night out (even if you have a specific requiring day for it). She should also be able to understand that you just want to be with your friends/peers from time to time. You just don't have the same dynamic if her son is there. You have a good relationship with him and that's all that matters. Talk to her and help her understand that you also need space in the relationship and balance the relationship with her children.", "NTA and you need to show her this post", "NTA!  \n\nAsk her if she would want to have a girl's night out with her friends and bring one of her daughters along.", "Not an ass hole at all, also it's Saturday night and he's 17 he can easily stay home alone or go hang with friends", "Question is guys night every Saturday night?", "So weird that 17 yo boys are not considered \"guys\" anymore.\n\nI smoked cigars and drank my bit of spirits at 17. When adults don't do adult things with you, you do it with whoever you can. Doing it only with teenagers thanks to \"grown guys\" not wanting to be a bad role model won't necessarily make it better.\n\nIf you are going to be a toxic model (more than what you told here) and you know that, then N A H. But trusting what you wrote as literal, soft YTA because it is not a problem to have that boy there socializing with other guys while you enjoy yourself.", "Since she gave her approval? You don\u2019t need her approval to go out.\n\nNTA. It\u2019s sad that Jake has grown up without a father, but this event is not appropriate for him.", "Knowing the scene you're going to and whether it fits Jake's parenting plan... you name it.\nGive Jake a healthier night...", "It may even be unfair to Jake. It doesn\u2019t sound like the gf asked Jake if he wanted to go to OP\u2019s poker night, just that she wants OP to take him. Most 17-year old boys have better things (play video games, hang out with friends, go on dates) to do on Saturday night than sit with his mom\u2019s boyfriend and friends watching them \u201cbe guys.\u201d\n\nPart of me wonders if \u201chaving Jake tag along\u201d is the girlfriend\u2019s way of checking up on OP. She wanted to do something with him, he already has plans, so she wants to know what happens at these guys night/ verify that it\u2019s actually happening.", ">and already has a feel for the kind of things that can and cannot be said when shit-talking.\n\nAnd what should be ignored and never ever repeated.... It sounded like the type of guys night where any guests should be vetted and approved by the GROUP *before* being invited. It wasn't watching a game or vid games and pizza, it was poker, whiskey and cigars. That is a trust first guys night, OP made the right call, the whole group would either be upset or set out to corrupt the teen to a scary degree, so either friendships get shaky or relationship gets ended.\n\n***BUT*** OP needs to do something *really* nice for gf if he doesn't want long term issues. Full spa day for gf and daughters while going to a local sporting event or guys movie with son may be warranted.", "Maybe OP could host a game himself and explain to the guys before hand the kid will be there. So they\u2019ll be prepared for the mood vs the mood suddenly crashing. I doubt they\u2019d care about a subdued night in as long as that\u2019s the plan from the beginning.", "25 isn't grown, its near mid life. You're not a toddler at 18. You're an adult.", "Yeah. I have two kids and I regularly see my mates for drinks and a bit of rowdy conversation. Nothing awful but I wouldn\u2019t want either of my kids there - and one of them is 19. Now if we had a day planned like karting or something else family friendly during the day then absolutely fine.", "Hasn't anybody here seen any Two and a Half Men episodes where their Jake ends up at a poker game with Charlie's friends? This Jake can end up winning a bunch of money and learning all about how to treat women! How can this possibly go bad?", "I don\u2019t wanna sound like a dick but do people really care about underage drinking and gambling when you\u2019re going to someone\u2019s house? I get why you wouldn\u2019t like smoking obviously but as long as he\u2019s not gambling away his money who cares. Although I still don\u2019t think he\u2019s TA for not bringing him", ">Not saying that his mom is an asshole though\n\nShe was TA the minute she thought she had any control over OP once she \"gave her approval\" for him to go out and do something.", "I wouldn\u2019t say he needs to bring him along to a guys night but might as well let him have one or two ciders or beers every other week at home", "I think you have the most solid take on this", "You get it.", "Eh, that's not the point.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe point is it's not an appropriate place for a child.", "You're an adult in the eyes of the Law, but that doesn't mean your input is welcome in the affairs of people with marriages, mortgages, children, etc.\n\nI've found 25 is about where regardless of your own experience with these things, your input starts to be considered.", "She \"gave her approval\" for her *kid* to go, I think, which is pretty normal: parents approve of where their kids go or not. I don't read OP's text as saying she had to approve of *him* going, she was just trying to pre-approve her *kid* joining. Which is still the asshole move, but I don't think is the same or as bad as what you are interpreting.", "Even better", "I could also understand it if it was your kid so you could make the decision to allow to the kid try a cigar or try alcohol that someone was having- in a safe environment.\n\nBut instead OP would have to be the one making sure that no one else is being a \"fun uncle\" giving the kid something that mom isn't okay with and not getting to relax with his friends.\n\nIgnoring that some conversations you don't want to have around a 17 yr old.", "That only slightly changes my perspective then. She was trying to force him to do something BECAUSE she gave her approval.", "It\u2019s not his kid. They have been only dating for a year .. the mom see him as a good man and trying to compact 17 years of a lack of male presence into this shirt 1 year relationship.. she needs to hold her horses before she runs this man off.", "I mean if he doesn't believe he should be around alcohol it is absolutely acceptable to not bring him around alcohol, your parental control ends where another person's decision making begins. If he's not comfortable taking a kid then she'll need to suck it up buttercup, she can't make him take the boy.", "Grown men are different than 17 year olds, they just are. I'm just saying the mom has no idea what she'd be sending him into.", ">OP clearly states Saturday night is lads night. This clearly indicates OP feels this time is the most important thing in their life\n\nThis is a wild leap to make", "I think you're probably also vastly overestimating how pure, innocent and ignorant women are.", "I'm not saying that. I know when they get out with their freinds for girls nights they no doubt become vulgar and everything too, just not sure she fully grasps how nasty men can get at these things. Maybe women are just as vulgar but something tells me that's not the case lol if it were me honestly I'd just take the kid along and let er rip, see if the kid keeps up or not, but if she complains that he came home and told her some nasty shit went on, tell her she wanted that for her kid.", "Your opinion is fine; its the leap of logic about the OP refusing to do anything on Saturday nights except party with his buddies, that is weird and that is un-substantiated in the original post. \"Saturday night is boys' night' does not mean \"every Saturday night is boys' night'. But you keep defending that and doubling-down on your leap of logic. You're the one who needs to chill, and accept that you're reading too much into things. \n\nAs well, the OP at this stage has no 'responsibilities' for the kids. He's dating their mother, that's it. I agree with you that as things progress he is going to have to become more of a family man, but he's already doing a lot of things with Jake, and seems like an overall good guy (who wants one night to live his own life with his friends, which is normal and allowed)."]}
