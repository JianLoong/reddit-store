He can't drink, he can't smoke, and I'll be honest, I imagine it'd be uncomfortable for everybody involved to have a kid at a Guys' Night unless he's used to hanging out with older guys and already has a feel for the kind of things that can and cannot be said when shit-talking.", "NTA. She's not thinking about this clearly. He's an underage kid, you're his mum's bf. It would be awkward for everyone involved.

Much better to ease them into it, to see and be part of alcohol being used in a sensible environment.  So I'd start considering just when you *might* start bringing him along. Not every week, sure. Also don't discount the bonding: if he WANTS to spend time with you at 17, then do so, because soon enough he won't want to, especially if you turn him down for opportunities to do so.

His nephew was 14 and they played poker, drank, smoked and cussed up a riot.  He is 17 - which means he has seen all of the above if not participated in all of the above which is probably why mom does not care if he goes.  She is not stupid - she knows what goes on.  Just as I know, and his sister knew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur nephew did not smoke, etc. But he did play cards and he did get to cuss and carry on - with the understanding that **what happens at the poker table stays at the poker table**.

Our youngest daughter has also been allowed to do the poker night (she was sooooo insistent about joining) and since it is with childhood friends and family - the males involved- she got to go.  They had a blast and enjoyed the bonding time with their uncle/father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I get where your gf is coming from too.  The kids enjoyed what happens here stays here and being able to hang out and play poker.  When I was 15 my grandfather let me join in on with some of his friends - I did not drink or smoke but I played poker with them, and my grandfather and his friends asked me if I had any jokes - they were talking the naughty kind - which I did have and I did tell them.  I am a girl, and I had a blast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI raised my kids - just because an adult does something - drinking, smoking, having sex, driving a car for nondrivers (under driving age) and so forth does not mean it is something they need to do until they are mature enough to handle the activity and it is legal.  Kids see all kinds of stuff from strangers and friends.  I don't mind my kids seeing how responsible adults have fun.  So men nights out that do no include anything sexual in nature was not considered a bad thing in my family nor among our friends.  We did stuff that they would probably do when they were adults - we just modeled the correct way to do it - meaning - No drinking and driving.  No drugs, etc.  They actually used it as an opportunity to talk about drinking - meaning how to do it appropriately.  How do enjoy yourself without harming others, etc.", "NTA.

You knew what the experience would be like and smartly said no.", "Definitely nta.\n\nFor one thing, you have to be allowed to have your own friends and social circle without being pressured to bring in other people, especially children.\n\nAnd on that note, no way is a 17 year old an appropriate guest at a poker night with a bunch of 40 year olds. Whisky, cigars, poker, and the attendant conversations are all going to be at least a decade ahead of a 17 year old.", "NTA.  You don't take a 17-year-old to a boy's night of drinking and gambling.  That is one of those milestones for when he's 21, maybe.  All of the things you plan to do there are illegal for him to participate in depending on where you live.", "NTA, what is Jake supposed to do? Just sit there while all this is going on? Kid is 17, I am sure he would rather be out hanging with his friends than with adults.", "NTA\n\nI think what you are doing currently is quality male bonding time. I don't think your own time with your friends should be compromised, and I'm not sure that environment would be a great idea anyway.", "NTA your partner is being short-sighted.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s not a place for a teenager + having him there wouldn\u2019t allow you to fully let your hair down. It seems you do other stuff with him and his siblings, no need to take them everywhere you go it\u2019s guys night", "NTA I think your gf thinks any male influence such as a guys night is good for Jake she hasn't had someone like you for the kids in years. You need to explain to her that bringing a child to an adult guy's night is not a good idea because bringing your kid kills the whole night for the rest of them", "NTA - if she expects father-son bonding (which you already do), that's where it's appropriate to bring Jake along.  \n\n\nFor a guy's night of gambling, drinking, smoking...makes no sense to be doing that with a minor. Especially if this is the USA - might as well wait it out til' he's 21 at least.\n\nIf it were: grabbing pizza and some beers and watching a sports event (hockey, basketball, baseball, etc.) yeah - might make a bit more sense/reasonable to bring Jake along. For this particular guys night...nah.", "NTA that's a weird bonding session your gf is trying you to have.  He'll soon be old enough to have his own guys nights.", "NTA. You don't bring children to guys night.", "NTA\n\nNo is a complete sentence.", "NTA. I'm strongly reminded of this kid in middle school who threw a tantrum because he wasn't invited to someone's birthday party. I know that's not the situation here, but the point is you can't invite yourself (or someone else) to a get-together that's not yours. She asked, he answered, and that's that.", "Nta. You want to relax and enjoy yourself.  If you can't do that with her son along, it's your choice.", "NTA.   \n\n\nIt's okay to want a night away from the family. I think if you wanted to bring him along it'd be fine, he's going to be 18 soon and out in the real world so he's likely going to be (and likely already has been) around all that before. But it's completely understandable to just want to let loose with friends without needing to stay composed around your stepson.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend's approval is not enough to allow you to bring Jake. This is a men's night out, and your friends didn't sign up to be mentors to Jake. Bringing him would be unfair to them.\n\nPerhaps, if some of them have teenage sons, you can suggest to them that every so often you have a \"fathers and sons\" get-together. But bringing him without their agreement is inappropriate and would probably break up the group.", "It's only going to get worse. Cut your losses now", "And just give your approval for her to take her son with her!\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nSimply because you\u2019re allowed to have time to yourself and hangouts with just you and your buddies. You\u2019re already close with Jake, and take him on lots of outings, guys night is for you and your friends to hang out and that\u2019s acceptable.", "NTA. But.. you could have told her you would check with your buddies and then told her they said no to children at poker night. Just sayin. You wouldnt even have to lie. Just talk with your buddies and let them know where you stand and I have no doubt they would agree.", "I will add my agreement here. It isn't a place for kids. You are entitled to some free time.  Probably you and the guys are going to get very inappropriate. The kid would probably be bored, and you don't need to be looking after a kid whilst trying to enjoy yourself in that situation. \n\nNTA", "I  agree, and just want to add,  the other men would probably  feel like they would have to hold back some as well,  as not to subject the kid to something that isn't appropriate.  So it would affect everyone else's enjoyment of the night,  not just OP.", "I was in the army and shooting guns at 16 (in Canada), age of consent and drinking is 16 or 18 in most of the world. It's so weirdly american and puritan to think you need to be 25 to be 'grown'.", "He's 17", "How is having a guy night toxic behavior?", "OP clearly states in the post that it's a Saturday night thing.", ">Every night is guys night?\n\nWhere did you get that from? Certainly not from anything OP wrote...", "> She seems controlling.\n\nTake it easy, nothing in his comment says she's controlling. She asked him something, he said no, she doesn't agree with his reasoning. Couples have disagreements, it's not like she's trying to ban him from going if he doesn't bring his stepson.", "Why does he need to do anything for gf? That's ridiculous. Everyone deserves friend time and alone time, especially he is not a coparent in anyway and was not breaking plans. The conversation should go like this in a normal healthy relationship:\nGf- \"hey you want to hang out saturday?\"\nOp- \"sorry, poker night with the guys!\"\nGf- \"oh that's great. Have fun!\"\nOp- \"does xyzday work?\"\nGf- \"sure sounds good!\"", "Dude the last part of your message is just yikes man. Grow a pair. A normal relationship you just express you need a night to yourself to unwind. A healthy relationship that would be okay. You don\u2019t need to treat your girl to a spa day and the whole nine just so you can get some time with your friends. Horrible advice and the opposite of a normal relationship.", "I agree with that but partying with middle-aged dudes before your ready can be...eye opening lol", "Lmao. Since when is 25 anywhere near mid life? Are you 13?", ">25 isn't grown, its near mid life.\n\nWhat's mid-life, 37 at a minimum (depending on how you count it)? 25 is literally closer to being a child than it is to mid-life.", "I don't know that she necessarily wants to check up on him, but maybe wants a night to herself. Either way, chances are, Jake does not want to go.", "  I wonder what the problem is like this? That would not make him less of a man and if she is afraid that he is gay, then tell her that it does not guarantee anything either.", "Either that or she doesn't want Jake left to his own devices on a weekend.", " NTA. That\u2019s no place for a teenager. I\u2019m sure your friends wouldn\u2019t want him around and he most likely wouldn\u2019t want to be there.", "I wonder what the problem is like this? That would not make him less of a man and if she is afraid that he is gay, then tell her that it does not guarantee anything either.", "> she is worried that her son grew up with a mom and two sisters but no males around\n\nWorried that this will result in ... **_what_**?\n\n> She talks about it a lot.\n\nSo what *exactly* is the consequence she's concerned about?", "I see that you\u2019re doing a nice thing being a role model for this kid. But you\u2019re allowed to take a night off. And it\u2019s not good for him to think you\u2019re a permanent fixture in his life and obligated to spend every weekend day with him if you\u2019re just not there in your relationship with his mom (yet). It\u2019s ok to have some boundaries, especially when it\u2019s for the kids\u2019 own good.", "Your NTA here. \n\nBut her concerns about him not having a group of adult male figures in his life are valid, as are her desires he spends time with groups of older men.\n\nPoker night isn't the environment for it though, and I'm sure you'll be able to make that clear to her eventually. \n\nIs poker the only thing you do with your friends? I know you've done a lot of activities with him, but you didn't mention if it was one on one or with your friends. I would suggest a compromise where you take him to a hangout with your friends without drinking and smoking involved and one where the activity is more his speed. \n\nBut I would also suggest all parties are involved in the decision and that includes your friends. They should know if the activity will involve a 17 year old prior to the events inception. And he should be asked by you without your GF there so he can decide if he wants to go on his own.\n\nIf he's nervous around older males, it might take a couple of asks and a couple nos before he says yes on his own. But being forced into an activity with the potential where he would be aware of the awkwardness caused by him isn't the right move.", "oh ok. I thought it was the oldest child.\n\nThat does not change the vote just the reasoning if that makes any sense: Yeah don't take a 17 years old to a mancave filled with tobacco and alcohol.", "It's a typo.  I meant Saturday night.  Every Saturday night.", "I meant every Saturday night", "Lol, they somehow time traveled from ye olden days when the average lifespan was in the 40s.", "I mean an adult in the eyes of nearly every single nation on earth, under all laws, everywhere. At 18 you're 100% responsible for every decision you make, and you're old enough to do what any other adult, of any other age can do. Treating your children like 22 year old toddlers isn't protecting them. Its cutting them off at the knees.", "Eh I get it, you need a good role model that matches you. I had a buddy in high school that was raised by his first-gen immigrant mother from India with 7 sisters. How he ended up the only guy amongst them I have no idea, talk about luck of the sperm ya know. But he talked about it a lot, without a strong male role model he found it difficult to connect with other men, difficult to talk to women in a romantic way, that kind of thing, he very much was pissed that his dad had stayed in India. \n\nHe's a great dude, but if you met him you'd immediately know that something was unique about his childhood. \n\nNTA OP, I understand where your wife is coming from and also understand where you're coming from. There's just a miscommunication on what it entails. Good work on being a good role model.", "Does the kid even want to go? Like why is the Mum insisting on this at all?", "But I'm struggling to work out why a 17 year old will want to hang out with a bunch of blokes in their 40's. Surely he has some friends he'd rather spend the night with.", " NTA this is an adult night out and you're right it's not appropriate for a teenager. This night is also about you being able to cut loose which you can't so with Jake around", "I think people are missing sarcasm here and downvoting.", "I wouldn\u2019t say he needs to bring him along to a guys night but might as well let him have one or two ciders or beers every other week at home", "looks like it :(", "  NTA. I'm pretty sure your mates wouldn't approve of him being there anyway. There are other things you can do to bond but this isn't it.", "Exactly, sounds like they already have a good relationship. Does the kid need to see \"dad\" smoking and drinking?", "Jake is 17.... did he even want to go with you? I can\u2019t imagine it would be fun for him.\n\nFishing, golfing, etc is all fine... poker night with bunch of old guys? Why would this be \u201cgood for him\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t recall teaching any of our kids how to party & gamble.\n\nNTA", "I could maybe see it if there were other similarly aged kids invited. but yeah..."]}
