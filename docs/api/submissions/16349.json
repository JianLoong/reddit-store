She's not thinking about this clearly. He's an underage kid, you're his mum's bf. It would be awkward for everyone involved.

Much better to ease them into it, to see and be part of alcohol being used in a sensible environment.  So I'd start considering just when you *might* start bringing him along. Not every week, sure. Also don't discount the bonding: if he WANTS to spend time with you at 17, then do so, because soon enough he won't want to, especially if you turn him down for opportunities to do so.

So she's hurt that 1. He's not available, 2. He only informed her he had other plans when **she** asked, 3. If he's been her son's role model it's quite possible that she HASN'T dated seriously until OP for the last 17 years, this would have meaning to her but OP's brisk denial and push off of her son shows that he might not take their relationship as seriously as she does. If u/Live-Bear7660 does actually value this relationship then he has to repair the accidental damage. How long is the guys night, what's he doing during the day? Can't he take her son out for lunch or something beforehand? Spa days don't have to be overly expensive and don't require going to a full spa AHs. A nice mani-pedi at a decent salon counts as a spa day. It's just a day of self care. Now, if he's like you abusive, self important losers, then yeah, he can demand she apologize to him for intruding on his time and can watch how all respect for him leaves her eyes if she has any self-worth.

His nephew was 14 and they played poker, drank, smoked and cussed up a riot.  He is 17 - which means he has seen all of the above if not participated in all of the above which is probably why mom does not care if he goes.  She is not stupid - she knows what goes on.  Just as I know, and his sister knew.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOur nephew did not smoke, etc. But he did play cards and he did get to cuss and carry on - with the understanding that **what happens at the poker table stays at the poker table**.

Our youngest daughter has also been allowed to do the poker night (she was sooooo insistent about joining) and since it is with childhood friends and family - the males involved- she got to go.  They had a blast and enjoyed the bonding time with their uncle/father.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, I get where your gf is coming from too.  The kids enjoyed what happens here stays here and being able to hang out and play poker.  When I was 15 my grandfather let me join in on with some of his friends - I did not drink or smoke but I played poker with them, and my grandfather and his friends asked me if I had any jokes - they were talking the naughty kind - which I did have and I did tell them.  I am a girl, and I had a blast.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI raised my kids - just because an adult does something - drinking, smoking, having sex, driving a car for nondrivers (under driving age) and so forth does not mean it is something they need to do until they are mature enough to handle the activity and it is legal.  Kids see all kinds of stuff from strangers and friends.  I don't mind my kids seeing how responsible adults have fun.  So men nights out that do no include anything sexual in nature was not considered a bad thing in my family nor among our friends.  We did stuff that they would probably do when they were adults - we just modeled the correct way to do it - meaning - No drinking and driving.  No drugs, etc.  They actually used it as an opportunity to talk about drinking - meaning how to do it appropriately.  How do enjoy yourself without harming others, etc.", "NTA.
