We live 2 hours away from my in laws. We only have one guest room that his sister and her family are staying in and my father in law got a nearby hotel.  His brother has two small kids (6yo and 3yo). \n\nAnyways my husband texted me while I was at work saying he offered our bedroom for his brother and his wife and his two kids to stay in for the weekend.   \n\nI got upset with him saying he should have asked me first and that I don\u2019t want to spend our Memorial Day weekend sleeping on the couch in our own home. So I asked my husband to retract his offer. He apologized saying he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Now I feel bad but I still don\u2019t like the idea of giving up our bedroom\u2026. I feel like a big bitch now\u2026 So AITA?\n\nUpdate\u2014\nWe live in a 3/2 (one guest room, one office and our master) with a pool near the beach. Family never visits us since we\u2019re 2h away, so that\u2019s why the family wanted to come over for the holiday weekend. \nI told my husband that I would post on Reddit to see what others thought and he told me to be prepared to see how many people will call me the A. Lol to our surprise a lot of you agree with me that it\u2019s weird to let 4 people sleep in your own bed. \nHe has good intentions and wants everyone to be together. He says he wants to hang with his siblings when the kids are put to sleep and if they go to a hotel that will make it less fun.. I\u2019m definitely feeling guilted in to backing out of saying no and allowing it. Thank you all for your responses and validation.\n\nUpdate 2- yes we have an air mattress for the office. He\u2019s saying we should sleep on the air mattress or the couch (couch is more comfy) and let his brothers family sleep in our room since there\u2019s 4 of them and only 2 of us. I\u2019m definitely a people pleaser especially for his family but the situation sucks. Even though many of you say NTA, I still feel like the villain because it\u2019s a \u201csimple fix\u201d and \u201clogical\u201d to just suck it up and sleep on the couch.

He doesn't mean to be unkind to me, but in his effort to be a great host, he'll sacrifice both of our comfort without checking with me. It was generally small enough things that I just went along with it for years. Then, when our twins were newborns, a bunch of his family came over to meet them. I excused myself to our bedroom to breastfeed and was shocked when the door opened after a few minutes and one of his family members made a bee line for us and started talking to me and touching my baby's face, less than an inch from my boob. After a couple uncomfortable minutes, they finally said that they'd needed to use the bathroom but the guest bath was occupied so my accommodating husband had said they could just go ahead and go into our bedroom to use the en-suite bath. I was furious and that led to a discussion that evening that he can sacrifice his comfort however he likes, but he doesn't get to sacrifice mine without prior approval. \n\nI'm a people pleaser and usually will happily sacrifice a lot for guests. But being a guest does not automatically make someone royalty. Giving up my bedroom is absolutely not happening. Especially considering how much of my private stuff I keep in my bedroom. Your husband needs to call them back and simply say he was wrong and that isn't an option. Hopefully he does not throw you under the bus and say that you don't want to give up your bed. \n\nIn future, is your place the best to host all the family? Hotels can be quite expensive, especially on holiday weekends. Maybe someone with a bigger house could host next time?", "So, possible compromises that probably won't work due to logistics I don't know, but JUST in case any help lol.

But, we talked it over, and we thought of a few other option(s) that might let us still enjoy some extra family time, etc.\"\n\n**1** \\- see if you can \"kid proof\" the office, possibly with help from Brother and his wife to revert back to normal after weekend ends, and maybe kids can crash there one night while adults stay up late and they sleep on a nice queen size air mattress in the living room? Bring a baby monitor if they have one? If they don't, and are worried about kids sleeping by themselves without a parent all night in a new house, maybe swap a parent out and bring the heavier sleeper into the living room once adults are all going to bed.\n\n**2** \\- see about everyone pooling in for a sitter for 3-4 hours, day or night, so adults can hang out without kids. If this works, maybe even see if  hubby wants just some sibling time (or possibly just brother without sister)? and you/wife/sister/FIL get either time together, or everyone gets some chill time by yourselves. Brother's wife might **really** like alone time that if their kids are at that age lol.\n\n**3** \\- if FIL has a hotel, see if brother + wife can get a room in the same hotel, and if FIL would be willing to watch the grandkids for an hour or two one evening at the hotel.
