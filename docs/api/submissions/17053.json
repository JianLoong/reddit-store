Is your husband willing to retract the offer? I would give up my bed in certain circumstances perhaps, but I\u2019d never offer without checking with my spouse first. Offering up your bed without your consent isn\u2019t cool and you\u2019re not wrong to be upset.", "NTA. Why should you give up your bedroom? There is no reason for it. Family can sleep on the couch or go to a hotel. Your husband was out of line offering it without asking you and behaved very well by understanding your very reasonable objection and rescinding the offer. Don't let guilt get to you. Stick to your guns.", "NTA - Funny, I was thinking about this the other day (we have some people coming over) and I realized, I would NEVER give up my bedroom in my house.  If that became the issue, I'd pay for a room for the people to stay elsewhere.   1 - There is NO reason for you to give up your bedroom and 2 - your husband should have NEVER offered this without consulting you first!", "Nta.  It's your house. They can get the couch if they want to save a few bucks.", "NTA , need I say it again NTA. 1. It's your home. 2. Letting other Couples sleep in your Marital bed is gross, regardless of who they are.", "Hell no - NTA - he gave up YOUR bed without discussing it with you first? No, you're not the AH here. I've been married almost 29 years, if my wife's family were visiting and she told me that she did that I'd be freaking livid.  This is OUR house, not her personal space, and that means we discuss that kind of thing ahead of time to make sure we're both okay with it. I'd never think to do that in reverse and approve something like that without running it by her.", "NTA.\n\n>he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal.\n\nYou do though. He's married to you and needs to listen to you.", "NTA \n\nGo stay in a hotel for the weekend.", "NTA. \nIt's your house, your bedroom and your bed. \nAt the very least, your husband should have asked before making the offer. \nPart of visiting someone is accepting that you're in a guest room, on a couch/air mattress or you can get a hotel.", "NTA. Your bedroom is your personal space with your personal belongings in it it\u2019s never ok for him to offer that to anyone else especially without talking to you first.", "NTA. This may be an issue due to cultural differences; some people have a tradition of offering up their own beds as part of being a host, and other people don't. It may be that your husband's family does that, and it didn't occur to him that you might not.\n\nI suggest being gracious and taking the couch for the weekend, and privately asking your husband to please check in with you before offering up your bed to guests again.", "I might be going against the grain, but NAH. I think you're well within your rights to say no to this, and he certainly should have run it by you before making the offer; that said, it doesn't seem all that weird to consider it, given that he probably wants everyone all together for the weekend and was trying to figure out how to squeeze everyone in together. Unless someone starts making a big stink out of this, I think it can be safely relegated to \"boundary we just stumbled over and talked through\" without needing to make anyone an AH.", "NAH.

It is our private space. \n\nAnd IF for some reason there was a decision made to allow someone to do so, it would be a decision made jointly by us in a \"two yeses, one no\" situation - meaning that both of us would be required to wholeheartedly agree to it and if one of us had any reservations, it wouldn't happen. \n\nDon't feel bad - your husband way overstepped boundaries here.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband basically offered someone else your sleeping spot without running it by you first, now he needs to fix the situation.\n\nIf there's a money issue, you can cover the hotel room for them if reasonably within your options.

I\u2019m assuming if you only have 1 guest room, you\u2019re house isn\u2019t huge. He should have checked with you first before offering your room. It would likely be more comfortable for everyone if they stay in a hotel.

I've made a similar mistake in the past of offering accommodations to my family that my partner was not happy with and had to retract the offer - it sucks. But you do what you need to do in order to make sure your partner is comfortable in their own home.
