We live 2 hours away from my in laws. We only have one guest room that his sister and her family are staying in and my father in law got a nearby hotel.  His brother has two small kids (6yo and 3yo). \n\nAnyways my husband texted me while I was at work saying he offered our bedroom for his brother and his wife and his two kids to stay in for the weekend.   \n\nI got upset with him saying he should have asked me first and that I don\u2019t want to spend our Memorial Day weekend sleeping on the couch in our own home. So I asked my husband to retract his offer. He apologized saying he didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. Now I feel bad but I still don\u2019t like the idea of giving up our bedroom\u2026. I feel like a big bitch now\u2026 So AITA?\n\nUpdate\u2014\nWe live in a 3/2 (one guest room, one office and our master) with a pool near the beach. Family never visits us since we\u2019re 2h away, so that\u2019s why the family wanted to come over for the holiday weekend. \nI told my husband that I would post on Reddit to see what others thought and he told me to be prepared to see how many people will call me the A. Lol to our surprise a lot of you agree with me that it\u2019s weird to let 4 people sleep in your own bed. \nHe has good intentions and wants everyone to be together. He says he wants to hang with his siblings when the kids are put to sleep and if they go to a hotel that will make it less fun.. I\u2019m definitely feeling guilted in to backing out of saying no and allowing it. Thank you all for your responses and validation.\n\nUpdate 2- yes we have an air mattress for the office. He\u2019s saying we should sleep on the air mattress or the couch (couch is more comfy) and let his brothers family sleep in our room since there\u2019s 4 of them and only 2 of us. I\u2019m definitely a people pleaser especially for his family but the situation sucks. Even though many of you say NTA, I still feel like the villain because it\u2019s a \u201csimple fix\u201d and \u201clogical\u201d to just suck it up and sleep on the couch.

He doesn't mean to be unkind to me, but in his effort to be a great host, he'll sacrifice both of our comfort without checking with me. It was generally small enough things that I just went along with it for years. Then, when our twins were newborns, a bunch of his family came over to meet them. I excused myself to our bedroom to breastfeed and was shocked when the door opened after a few minutes and one of his family members made a bee line for us and started talking to me and touching my baby's face, less than an inch from my boob. After a couple uncomfortable minutes, they finally said that they'd needed to use the bathroom but the guest bath was occupied so my accommodating husband had said they could just go ahead and go into our bedroom to use the en-suite bath. I was furious and that led to a discussion that evening that he can sacrifice his comfort however he likes, but he doesn't get to sacrifice mine without prior approval. \n\nI'm a people pleaser and usually will happily sacrifice a lot for guests. But being a guest does not automatically make someone royalty. Giving up my bedroom is absolutely not happening. Especially considering how much of my private stuff I keep in my bedroom. Your husband needs to call them back and simply say he was wrong and that isn't an option. Hopefully he does not throw you under the bus and say that you don't want to give up your bed. \n\nIn future, is your place the best to host all the family? Hotels can be quite expensive, especially on holiday weekends. Maybe someone with a bigger house could host next time?", "So, possible compromises that probably won't work due to logistics I don't know, but JUST in case any help lol.

Bring a baby monitor if they have one? If they don't, and are worried about kids sleeping by themselves without a parent all night in a new house, maybe swap a parent out and bring the heavier sleeper into the living room once adults are all going to bed.\n\n**2** \\- see about everyone pooling in for a sitter for 3-4 hours, day or night, so adults can hang out without kids. If this works, maybe even see if  hubby wants just some sibling time (or possibly just brother without sister)? and you/wife/sister/FIL get either time together, or everyone gets some chill time by yourselves. Brother's wife might **really** like alone time that if their kids are at that age lol.\n\n**3** \\- if FIL has a hotel, see if brother + wife can get a room in the same hotel, and if FIL would be willing to watch the grandkids for an hour or two one evening at the hotel.

Meaning that there is nothing vital in there that you would need to access if a guest is staying for a week. \n\nEmotionally though, because of all the personal things in my bedroom, I would actually feel violated by allowing somebody to have access to every drawer, every closet, every piece of intimate clothing, or items that I owned. Things in my bedroom are private. Things I do in my bedroom are private. It\u2019s a really icky feeling to have anyone in my bedroom other than me.\n\nI would feel equally uncomfortable if A friend or family member told me they would give up their bed when I came to visit. There\u2019s no way I would have any interest in sleeping in somebody else\u2019s bed. I would much rather sleep on the sofa.", "Of course I\u2019ve slept in a hotel bed. But the comparison is apples and oranges\u2014I understand that random couples have sex in hotel beds all the time. The sheets are changed the room is (presumably but that\u2019s a different story) cleaned, and the entire set up of public lodging is that understanding that multiple people slept in that bed before. Whatever. \n\nBut that\u2019s a lot different to me than inviting my BL and his wife to come sleep in the same bed where their nieces and/or nephews were conceived. There is something uniquely intimate about THAT bed and the activities that go on there, or just simply that it\u2019s a sacred space for the relationship.

For the friend, usually they sleep in my bed but I am on a mattress on the floor in the same room. So I would know if they were sniffing around. And for my brother, why would he go through my things? He goes there, sleeps, get up and get out. Same thing when I sleep in his room when he is away and I am staying at my mom's place (he lives there) why would I go through his things? Except if given explicit permission like I call him and ask if I can use his PC, you don't touch things that aren't yours? And such, I don't offer people to stay at my house if I don't trust them.

And the six year old can have the couch, it\u2019s even better if you can put a movie on for them at bedtime. That would most likely be the best arrangement for them.

Any objections now are on you\n\nNTA", "If you give up your bedroom,  you then have to pack clothes, etc. to sleep elsewhere in the house, so you're not constantly having to \"invade their space.\" So inconvenient. I would buy another air mattress and put them in the office.\n\nNTA. Your husband should not have volunteered your bed without discussing it with you first. Now,  he's put you in an awkward position no matter what you decide.", "NTA. Honestly they\u2019re only two hours away; I don\u2019t see why they even need to sleep over. I feel like some people drive that long just to get to work. For them to take your bedroom because of a 2 hour drive is ridiculous to me. They can book a hotel room if it\u2019s that inconvenient for them.", "Are you mentally prepared for the chance of someone else having sex in your room/on your bed? NTA but be prepared to sleep on the couch next time if you fold now.", "NTA \n\nI WOULD NEVER \n\nIdk, that feels like such an invasion of privacy to me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to handle letting guests sleep in my room/bed, honestly.\n\nEdit: clarification", "I wouldn't like the idea of anyone in my bed. My bed is my personal space to decompress in my life. It would be like letting family come over and wear your underwear around all day. If it's an emergency it can have a pass, but it's still gonna feel a little weird.", "Honestly though, all your stuff is in the bedroom, so it would be super inconvenient for them to have you guys needing to come in to the room they're staying any time you needed clothes or anything else from your room.\n\nMy husband does similar things, where his heart is in the right place, but he forgets that being married, these kinds of things need to be considered by both people, not just one individual. He's working on being better about it though!", "Put the kids on the couch (assuming they're little kids and will both fit) and his brother and his wife can sleep on the air mattress.\n\nOr, they can stay at the same hotel as their father.", "boo. this is a bummer. you deserve a space where you can escape his family. like your master. \n\nhis family should be on the couch and air mattress.", "No one, ever, is allowed to sleep in my bed besides me and my husband. It gives me SUCH MAJOR ICK to think about it, and the SAME MAJOR ICK to think about staying in any of my family or friends\u2019 beds. No no no no no.", "I missed that. Sorry. I read that as BIL not brother. I still think NTA. I edited my original comment to sound less angry but I don't like this situation towards you.", "This is so true. People feel way more entitled to our time/space, and clearly OP\u2019s husband is no exception here", "This right here... Nana, sure she can have my bed.\nMy brother? That ish can sleep on my couch or an air mattress \ud83d\ude02", "NTA - We did this in my family, too.  It didn't bother me, because I enjoyed my relatives. Once they got up, I could use my bedroom.  Even my parents sometimes ended up on the couch.\n\nHOWEVER - Doing this without talking to the other person who uses the room is inexcusable.", "Right? Maybe it's a cultural thing? Idk, anytime any of our family or friends visit we always offer our master bedroom. I wouldn't dream of having a parent on the air mattress. The disrespect.", "We definitely got the worst sleeping accomodations as kids. When the inlaws are full up though, I was shocked to be offered the floor in the main living area so that each of kids got a bed. On top of the fact I was always taught that adults get first dibs on the beds/privacy of their own room, I also have a bad back. And the family stayed up till 2am most nights playing video games right next to us trying to sleep on the floor.  I still am salty about it. I earned my guest bed privileges from the dozens of nights sleeping on the floor as a kid, dammit!", "Also depends tho. I had twin beds in my room growing up, and my brother just had the one bed (which was already kinda annoying bc he had so much room for playing and all my floor space was bed. Except during sleepovers, then I loved the twin beds bc I didn\u2019t have to sleep on the floor to make my fiend comfortable/match their level for talking or whatever.) ANYWAYS. My grandparents ALWAYS got my room growing up. Which makes sense logically to me; I\u2019ve got two beds, they are two people. But it was always SO annoying to make a bed out of an camping pad and the flannel sleeping bag in the dead of summer on my parent\u2019s bedroom floor and listen to my dad\u2019s insanely loud snores all night long. I can hear them in my childhood bedroom through 2 walls and a bathroom, imagine how loud they are in the same room. It always felt so unfair that I had to give up ease of access to my clothes and changing space and desk/vanity and toys and toss and turn all night only to be woken up by my parents getting up and turning on the lights at the buttcrack of dawn like their normal routine called for\u2026 all while my brother just got to retreat to his room and sleep comfortably in his bed and change like normal instead of the bathroom that everyone always knocking asking if you\u2019re done so they can get in there\u2026 again, logically I get it. But maybe my parents should have had let me sleep in my brother\u2019s bed every couple of visits or so. I got such terrible sleep, and my whole body hurt and everyone downplayed the sacrifices I made by being displaced. And the fact that there was never any switching off with my brother, that he was never asked to sacrifice his space, still feels a bit gendered to me tbh.", "In the south when I grew up that was also the expectation as well. I\u2019m in my 60s so perhaps the norm has changed now. I still give up my bed for guests."]}
