The two of us live there on a lease, but her boyfriend \"Jake\" (23m) will often come over to spend with her.  Not so much it's like he's practically living with us for free, but enough that I don't get surprised if I come home to see him on the couch occasionally.\n\nYesterday, I made an Oreo dirt cake for Thanksgiving.  I'm the dirt cake lady for my family and friends. I'll make it for birthdays, Christmas, New Year's, and Thanksgiving.  People will ask me to make it or I'll do it as a given.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis year, I changed things up slightly with golden Oreos and was happy with the result as I got it loaded into our freezer for it to set overnight.  I checked it on briefly this morning and transferred it to the fridge before going to work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, while Jake eats while over at our apartment, it's usually Chelsea's food or food we share with each other like pizza, chips, popcorn, etc.  I don't mind if either of them eats some of my food, but I will point out if something is for a special occasion so they don't eat it.\n\nI texted Chelsea that the dirt cake in the fridge was for my family's Thanksgiving dinner and to keep her and Jake's hands off it.  She gave me a thumbs-up emoji in reply, and I didn't think anything of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't expect when I got home to see Chelsea and Jake on the couch, watching a movie with the bowl the dirt cake was in on the living room table and half eaten. There were two big spoons inside of it.  Obviously, I got irritated and asked her why the fuck did she and her boyfriend eat the dirt cake when I explicitly said to leave it alone since it was for my family in my text.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nChelsea tried to claim that the text must've not gotten through but I shut that down quickly by showing that she replied to it.   Chelsea clammed up and Jake tried to defend her by saying it's just pudding, which pissed me off more.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI remembered that I still had time to remake the dirt cake, so I asked Chelsea and Jake to give me honey so I go shopping to buy the ingredients and redo it, telling them the price.  They both refused and told me I was being overly dramatic over a dessert that doesn't even taste all that great.  I asked them if it wasn't good then why is half of it gone in one sitting.  They didn't answer me so I rolled my eyes and told them I expected the money by tomorrow morning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJake left soon after that, and Chelsea refused to speak to me for the rest of the night.  I told my siblings what happened and they told me I was right to ask for them to pay for the cost.  Our mutual friends however think I'm being dramatic over the situation and think I should just pay for it myself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1700627289, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1810rgu/aita_for_asking_my_friend_and_her_boyfriend_to/", "score": 260, "replies": ["NTA. They were incredibly greedy and inconsiderate and you only asked for them to replace what they took despite acknowledging that they shouldn't take it.", "NTA. You probably won't get your money back, but don't hesitate to grocery shop Chez Chelsea. She owes you.", "NTA they knew what they were doing. They definitely need to pay you for it, but I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath that they actually will.", "NTA\n\nThey 100% owe you for the cake. They quite literally stole from you. She can't claim she didn't know..... I can do you one better.... Years ago my ex's cousin (who lived with her) took a giant chunk of a cake I made (to top it off, she took a piece from the damn middle of the cake that hadn't been cut) for Valentine's Day.... She 100% knew it wasn't hers and for sure knew what it was for because it was a cake in the shape of a heart.... So I feel your pain. I was livid.", "NTA \n\nWhat an awful thing to happen then they try to lie and rationalize their way out on top of it! Even when you called them out!\n\nYou are so not being dramatic. I think the rules need to be changed ASAP. There will be no more sharing of your food or anything else. If he's staying overnight too many times a month then he needs to be on the lease and pay 1/3 of the rent. They owe you the money but you can't force them to pay you. \n\nLooks like you need to shop for a new roommate just before your lease is up. I wonder how many other things she lies about.", "NTA obviously and just who are these \"mutual friends\" who think you should be feeding your roommate and her boyfriend for free?", "Geez cookies and supplies are expensive.  They are extremely inconsiderate.  Do you really need her as a roommate?  She seems to lie, gaslight,  and not at all respect you, your rime, or your money. \n\nYou are NTA.", "Your mutual friends have no idea what \u201cdramatic\u201d can be. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re calculating up the cost of ingredients and labor and taking her to small claims court. Or making a new cake \u201csweetened\u201d with salt instead of sugar and leaving it in the fridge as bait for next time. Or helping yourself to an equivalent value worth of her food. Any number of things you could have done that WOULD have been dramatic. But you decided to be the adult and just ask for the cost of ingredients. NTA at all.", "I'd like to see how they would react if you eat their food. In fact, you should take something of Chelsea's to serve to your family. NTA", "NTA. They stole from you by eating your food that you made clear was off-limits.", "NTA.  Your roommate and her BF are thieves - they literally stole from you.", "NTA. They were rude to do each of those things. Eating it, refusing to pay, saying it didnt taste great. I bake and cook a lot and would be extremely annoyed to have to remake something that I explicitly said was off limits. And I would feel like an absolute ass if I ate someones food, would probably offer to remake it myself.", "If she doesn't pay you in time, find some of her ingredients and use them to make something else. If she complains, call it even.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Cost of living crisis here in aus so I assume its the same elsewhere -  its sad that its cheaper to buy some supermarket cake than make one yourself, and you explicitly told them not to touch this cake.  They should pay for the ingredients - you will still have to pay the labour cost of making it all over again.", "Ugh I hate entitled brats who think they own everything. First they lie to you, then they say oh it\u2019s not that good stop being dramatic, then they don\u2019t even have a shroud of self respect and respect for you to atleast pay for the ingredients so you can whip up a new batch! Nowhere was there been a hint of an apology! Either kick your roommate out or just ask her to keep her hands off your food altogether! NTA but I would die on this hill. She is a roommate, there is etiquette", "When I see posts about such scavenger behavior, I would hate to have such ppl in my life.\n\nYour bigger problem is that ppl with shit behavior and no class are in your life.", "NTA\n\nNot only were they rude for eating what was clearly not up for grabs, they ate it out of the bowl which pretty much negates the possibility of anyone else having any (not that you would have taken a partially eaten dessert to your family dinner.) It seems to me that they planned on eating it all because there certainly weren\u2019t any plans made for leftovers.", "NTA. They absolutely owe you. You\u2019re not being dramatic. I\u2019d be pissed off, too. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to pay you back, but Chelsea is definitely a bad friend by denying she didn\u2019t get your text, being a pushover for her bf who\u2019s not even paying to live there, and then calling you dramatic. \n\nI\u2019d level with her about how this cost you time and money. She and her bf blatantly disrespected you, too. Might be time for Jake to spend more time at his own place.", "Nta but that mutual friend that thinks your being over dramatic, is most likely on her side & that friend sounds Like they don't actually care bout you , think bout it. You set a bountry. What they did was extremely inconsiderate. Not only did they try to insult your cake but they acted like they were entitled to it. They probably feel like they owe you nothing & that's its easy to replace. If they felt bad in any way, they should've offered to at least replace it or pay for the ingredients you need. But they didn't feel even slightly remorseful. Meaning they didn't care about you , your family & they didn't care that you would've been upset.", "Nta", "NTA. Those two are disrespectful thieves. Neither of them have the balls to admit they forgot about the message. Why tf didn't they go buy their own dessert instead of stealing yours? Time to start looking for a new place to live. Either that or keep your stuff in a lockbox where they can't touch it.", "NTA\n\nShe knew she wasn't supposed to eat it and stuck her spoon in and helped eat half!  Your roommate sucks!", "NTA. They stole from you", "NTA. You have to be a special kind of asshole to eat food you know isn\u2019t yours and looks like it\u2019s for a fancy occasion! Hope they reimburse you.", "NTA  You shouldn't even have to tell them not to eat your food without asking. It's total disrespect on both their parts. You pointedly said not to eat it they did anyway then lied. When they were caught in the lie they tried saying it didn't taste good. They should have offered to pay for it and not even had to ask since they stole your food. I hope they see your post so can know how little people think of them.", "I am always astounded when I read these type of posts.\nWere Chelsea and Jake raised by wolves?\nSurely at some point in their childhood they were told not to take things that didn\u2019t belong to them.\nNTA", "NTA.     When rent comes up, pay them minus the cost of the cake. That should take care of it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who eats food that is obviously made for special occasion!", "Talk about rude. You're not dramatic. They stole the food and now are trying to make you believe it wasn't as shitty a move as it was. They should pay, and you should make it clear they are never to touch anything of yours again as you cannot trust them to replace what they eat, plus they treat your work and your special day preparations as if it's crap. No. NTA", " NTA", "NTA \n\nEating a cake that doesn\u2019t belong to you is an incredibly dickish thing to do!

They need to pay up for their deliberate fuck up. What rude jerks", "NTA - Not only did they keep lying, they went on the offensive and dissed your dessert saying it wasn\u2019t that good.
