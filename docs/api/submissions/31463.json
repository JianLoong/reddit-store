She gave me a thumbs-up emoji in reply, and I didn't think anything of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't expect when I got home to see Chelsea and Jake on the couch, watching a movie with the bowl the dirt cake was in on the living room table and half eaten.

I think the rules need to be changed ASAP. There will be no more sharing of your food or anything else.

I\u2019d be pissed off, too. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to pay you back, but Chelsea is definitely a bad friend by denying she didn\u2019t get your text, being a pushover for her bf who\u2019s not even paying to live there, and then calling you dramatic. \n\nI\u2019d level with her about how this cost you time and money. She and her bf blatantly disrespected you, too.

You set a bountry. What they did was extremely inconsiderate. Not only did they try to insult your cake but they acted like they were entitled to it.
