I think the rules need to be changed ASAP. There will be no more sharing of your food or anything else.

I\u2019d be pissed off, too. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to pay you back, but Chelsea is definitely a bad friend by denying she didn\u2019t get your text, being a pushover for her bf who\u2019s not even paying to live there, and then calling you dramatic. \n\nI\u2019d level with her about how this cost you time and money. She and her bf blatantly disrespected you, too.

You set a bountry. What they did was extremely inconsiderate. Not only did they try to insult your cake but they acted like they were entitled to it.

I know food isn't cheap, but how much are we talking about here, $20? Maybe $25? Are they so broke they would put a rift in your friendship over such a small amount when they *know* they were wrong to begin with? Yeah, it's time to begin the process of cutting them loose. \n\nI'd go the petty revenge route until one of you can move, but that's just me.", "NTA\n\nEat all of her food!", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA.\n\nTell Chelsea that if they don't reimburse you, that Jake is **not** allowed over any more.", "NTA stand your ground and tell her if her BF is there all the time he has to start paying rent!", "They should pay. Next time make a decoy cake with laxatives in it", "NTA but Chelsea and Jake are AHs. Their behaviour was terrible.

Your \"friends\" only care about which outcome they think will cause them the least stress.  So they pick the one that tells you to let it go.  \n\nI don't see you as being dramatic.  I see you as being completely rational, while they lie to your face.  You didn't have a nutty, you told them exactly how they failed you.  Your friends suck.", "NTA- Personally I don\u2019t understand how they can even refuse. Even if they didn\u2019t know and it was a mistake, they should still feel some remorse and at minimum pay for the ingredients. The fact that it\u2019s only cookies and pudding by their definition makes it sound like it wouldn\u2019t even cost that much to buy. It just shows you how they feel about the relationship if they are not willing to help you. \n\nIf you\u2019re roommate is unwavering on paying you for the ingredients, you need to change your stance on her boyfriend being there all the time. Put your foot down and tell her you now realize he is costing you a lot of money. Regardless if it is left overs, you\u2019re not the one consuming it. Also his use of utilities while there, I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t going home to shower and use the restroom. Tell her you want her to pay more for all the shared cost as he is using them as well. Unfortunately with her on the lease you can\u2019t kick him out as he is her guest. But maybe by bringing it to light she will see it\u2019s not worth all the aggregation and at least pay you for the cake.", "NTA those two are definitely massive ones. Why should you pay for a cake you baked for an event that they ate without permission.", "NTA I suggest that you never make your mutual friends dirt cake.

They should run you your coins.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nCan you share the recipe?", "NTA It's all well and good for your friends to tell you to let people pick your pocket -- after all it's not their money being taken. (It's always easy to be generous with other people's time and money, especially to signal your own supposed virtue.)\n\nOn top of that, it's the absolute gall and insult to injury. She knows they shouldn't eat it --> They eat it anyway. --> Refuse to pay for replacement ingredients (your time would not be compensated for regardless)  --> They tell you it didn't taste good.

Good, very welcome that.", "NTA", ">Our mutual friends however think I'm being dramatic over the situation and think I should just pay for it myself.\n\nFine. Go in her room and take something of equal value and sell it. See how that goes over. I'd start chasing Jake out. Why they're trying to lie to you is the part I'd be really pissed over.

Kinda defeats the point of Thanksgiving.", "NTA, your roommate and her other half are behaving in an unbelievably greedy and entitled way.  Bottom line she got the message of \"hands off the dirt cake\" and she ignored it and lied.  Lying to you I feel is worse than what they did.

Some of your friends think you should pay for it yourself? Lol, they are not your friends, absolutely. Jake and Chelsea are TA.
