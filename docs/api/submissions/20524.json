What's wrong in your marriage is bigger than an AITA. There's no way you should be getting last choice on anything.", "NTA. You and your wife need to talk and get on the same page BEFORE discussing with your son", "NTA is this a normal thing with you guys? You dont get a say in things and your wife makes the decision unilaterally? Sounds like a bigger problem than the car. You need to have a serious talk with her about this generel issue.", "NTA, assuming you own the car.\n\nPerhaps your son could get a job, work, earn money, and save up to buy a \"fun\" car for himself which he could then drive whenever he wanted.

Perhaps it will teach him that feeling entitled to the best car earns him no car. Also, what is the deal with your wife making unilateral decisions that favor your son?", "NTA. This is wild. I will admit I\u2019ve raised some rotten kids, but even they would understand they get last pick of family cars (assuming all cars are parent-purchased).", "Nta. A new driver shouldn't be driving the newer (and nicer) car around. At least if he were to wreck one of the older cars, it wouldn't be as great of a loss.", "> We decided to do something fun and get my wife a Miata convertible\n\nI have a feeling that wasn't a WE decision. YTA to yourself, I cant pretend to understand your relationship dynamic and how it works for you, but it doesn't look great from the outside.

Your wife upgraded to a new car and decided to let your son have her old car.\n\nThen when she was injured she decided who she would swap cars with while she was injured and who would get to drive her car in the meantime.\n\nThe only problem I see with family dynamics is that you don\u2019t think they involve your wife having any agency. Clearly the two of you disagreed on how things should work. One of you was going to get your way and the other wasn\u2019t. Your wife got her way this time, and you seem to have a real issue with that that I don\u2019t think is about getting to drive a convertible.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
