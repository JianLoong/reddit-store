{"id": 6929, "submission_id": "107n5mf", "title": "AITA for only speaking my mother language in my home and making my son's girlfriend uncomfortable?", "selftext": "Throwaway since my coworkers know my main account. All names are fake for privacy yada yada.\n\nSome background:\n\nI (41M) am originally American. I moved to Norway over two decade ago for school and met my wife (38F, Mary). We have three kids (16M, John, 14F, and 13M). Mary and I both think being at least bilingual is a necessary skill, so we speak English in our home. The kids are free to speak in either English or Norwegian at home, and my wife will speak Norwegian about 50% of the time, but I speak English 99% of the time at home. I do so because it both comes easier to me and I would hate to get rusty, plus it's a nice respite from my work life where I seldom get to speak English.\n\nOnto the story:\n\nA few months ago John started dating a girl (16F, Hannah) and he introduce to the family in early December. She's a very sweet girl and has definitely been good for him. She seemed a bit quiet, but I didn't really pay it any mind. Until last Thursday. Hannah came over for dinner and about halfway through John was staring daggers at me. After dinner Hannah left and John said he needed to speak to me. He told me that Hannah was too intimidated to speak and has felt excluded since she met me because her English isn't the best. I asked if she was having a hard time understanding me, and if so I can speak slower and more clearly. He told me that wasn't enough and I needed to speak Norwegian so that she doesn't feel like a idiot spectator in my presence. For context, both of his siblings still spoke Norwegian and they were leading most of the discussion alongside Mary. I told my son that this is my home, and I will speak in the language I want, I can accommodate his girlfriend in any other way but this has been the agreement in our house since he was born. He called me a stubborn jerk and said that this is Norway, people speak Norwegian, and that it was unfair that she should feel like an idiot just because she doesn't speak my mother tongue.\n\nMary chimed in and said that he should give Hannah lessons if it was a big problem and that she could help him do so. John said that wasn't the point and then stormed off to his room. He hasn't been speaking to me since and both of his siblings have said I should just speak Norwegian when she's here. My wife is on my side and said he'll get over it eventually but said if it really bothers me I should just concede. My coworkers are split on the issue and so I'm here. AITA?\n\nEdit: English is taught in schools here at a very young age and from what I've heard from Hannah speaking; she is pretty good, just uncomfortable.\n\nEdit 2: I realized I said a decade instead of two, I moved when I was 20.\n\nEdit 3: I am extremely surprised by the volume of comments on this post. While I think a lot of commenters here don't understand how common English is here or the general level of proficiency, especially amongst the young, making Hannah uncomfortable is not my goal and I really do think she's very, very good for and to John. I will apologize to John in the morning and ask if him, Hannah and I can sit down and talk about how I can make her feel more comfortable visiting our home. Thank you to all the commenters here, even the one's who called my son a dick, which he isn't, just a teenager trying to navigate his first relationship. I will be going to bed now as it is late but I will be reading the comments in the morning in case anyone has some insight. Once again, thank you for commenting and taking the time to read about my problems.\n\nEdit 4: why did I wake up to so many comments filled with seething rage? The name calling is rather unnecessary. What nerve did I strike in the American psyche that so many would be so angry? \\*4.5\\* I talked with my son this morning, or rather he talked to me. He told me he was sorry about the \"i Norge snakker vi norsk\" and I apologized for dismissing him completely. I'm taking him and his girlfriend out for lunch today.", "created_utc": 1673291924, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/107n5mf/aita_for_only_speaking_my_mother_language_in_my/", "score": 819, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This means that someone else in the group will have an answer ready before I have fully understood what was said previously, making it incredibly hard to fully participate in the conversation.

This doesn't mean you need to speak Norwegian all the time, but slow down, actively involve her in the conversation by talking to her directly so that no one answers before her and she can get a \"turn\", let her know that is fine for her to reply to you in Norwegian even when you speak English, and allow her a break by speaking Norwegian if she becomes much more stressed than usual.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

All names are fake for privacy yada yada.\n\nSome background:\n\nI (41M) am originally American. I moved to Norway over a decade ago for school and met my wife (38F, Mary). We have three kids (16M, John, 14F, and 13M). Mary and I both think being at least bilingual is a necessary skill, so we speak English in our home. The kids are free to speak in either English or Norwegian at home, and my wife will speak Norwegian about 50% of the time, but I speak English 99% of the time at home. I do so because it both comes easier to me and I would hate to get rusty, plus it's a nice respite from my work life where I seldom get to speak English.\n\nOnto the story:\n\nA few months ago John started dating a girl (16F, Hannah) and he introduce to the family in early December. She's a very sweet girl and has definitely been good for him. She seemed a bit quiet, but I didn't really pay it any mind. Until last Thursday. Hannah came over for dinner and about halfway through John was staring daggers at me. After dinner Hannah left and John said he needed to speak to me. He told me that Hannah was too intimidated to speak and has felt excluded since she met me because her English isn't the best. I asked if she was having a hard time understanding me, and if so I can speak slower and more clearly. He told me that wasn't enough and I needed to speak Norwegian so that she doesn't feel like a idiot spectator in my presence. For context, both of his siblings still spoke Norwegian and they were leading most of the discussion alongside Mary. I told my son that this is my home, and I will speak in the language I want, I can accommodate his girlfriend in any other way but this has been the agreement in our house since he was born. He called me a stubborn jerk and said that this is Norway, people speak Norwegian, and that it was unfair that she should feel like an idiot just because she doesn't speak my mother tongue.\n\nMary chimed in and said that he should give Hannah lessons if it was a big problem and that she could help him do so. John said that wasn't the point and then stormed off to his room. He hasn't been speaking to me since and both of his siblings have said I should just speak Norwegian when she's here. My wife is on my side and said he'll get over it eventually but said if it really bothers me I should just concede. My coworkers are split on the issue and so I'm here.

And so was his response - i Norge snakker vi norsk.  \n\nThat said, I found my husband\u2019s family horribly rude when I first moved here and at dinner they spoke entirely in Norwegian. All are fluent in English, but they spoke Norwegian the ENTIRE time, except when asking me something - like \u2018did you like the brown cheese\u2019. Despite my husband repeatedly mentioning to them that it was rude. They would just lapse into Norwegian. I get that it was easier for them and it was their home, but still, I was disappointed that they couldn\u2019t even try to make an effort. And, because like most Norwegians, they hate confrontation - they never explained or took the time to bring it up with me. So, please don\u2019t be like my in-laws. \n\nI would sit them down and explain the situation - that you feel more comfortable speaking English, you want to relax in your home speaking your native language, and you don\u2019t want to lose those skills, plus it will help Hannah be better at English to practise speaking with a native speaker. Or work out a compromise. She\u2019s 16 and probably intimidated and doesn\u2019t want to \u2018sound stupid\u2019 in front of her new bf\u2019s family.", "NTA\n\nI mean... sure, you can welcome her in in Norwegian (hello how are you blah de blah) but the rest of the time? Nope.\n\nI mean I'm French and sometimes I speak English myself when the French cannot come out... guess what... it taught MY MOM English xD", "I feel like there\u2019s often not enough distinction made between what is allowed and what is decent - I mean, we get it, \u2018your house your rules\u2019, nobody can really tell you that you are \u2018not allowed\u2019 to speak whatever language you want in your own home, but why on earth don\u2019t you WANT to accommodate the girlfriend just as part of being decent? What harm does it do you? How is it unjust? Or insulting in any way? Or anything worthy of digging your heels in? It\u2019s not even a case of her being equally fluent in both languages but making a preference for one over the other - she is more competent with one language, thus feels more confident communicating in that language, and would of course feel that she could contribute more in a conversation where she can use that language. Given the lack of any malice on her part, why is it SO important to you to speak English in this particular instance (when there are other instances where you do not choose to take a stand against using Norwegian, such as at work) - is it going to make you feel uncomfortable to use Norwegian if you are at home? Do you fear that if you do it on the rare occasion that she is there that you won\u2019t get to use English often enough to remember it? Seems unlikely. It just doesn\u2019t make sense why you feel so strongly about it to the point where it is actually important to you to not accommodate her. I\u2019m going to say YTA because I think you are just being stubborn, but sure, you are \u2018allowed\u2019 to make your own house rules with no exceptions - and the gf is allowed to avoid your house and any interaction with you since those rules are obviously more important to you than her comfort and developing a relationship with her (and watch your son follow her).", "NTA. I\u2019m familiar with Norway and know how widely English is spoken there. She should be excited about the opportunity to learn more. Also, she could speak in Norwegian, what is stopping her?", "YTA. Rest of the conversation flow is in Norwegian. YTA for disrupting it to accommodate a choice. Your English won\u2019t get worse by not speaking it during dinner a few nights a week.", "Ok. This is a weird space because I have no cultural reference here. But in my country we have 11 official languages. No one has an issue with anyone speaking their mother tongue in their own home. But here are some guidelines:\n\n1) if you are speaking to others, speak english (son, please pass the butter? English)\n2) if you speak to her specifically, speak norwegian (son's gf, would you pass the butter? Norwegian)\n3) if you are speaking to everyone in general, mix the two, say half in english, half in norwegian. (I am going to the store - english. Would anyone like to come with me or need anything? - Norwegian)\n\nThat way she will always know whether she is directly being spoken to and expected to answer / invited to participate.\n\nWhen she hears english only, she should just know that while you have no issue with her hearing what you are saying, she is not expected to participate.\n\nBecause sometimes a conversation between 2 people, although not private, has nothing to do with a 3rd person in the same room. \n\nThis is generally how we navigate the situation in a multilingual family / friend group / work place and people dont get offended unless you are purposely excluding them from ALL conversation.", "NTA. \n\nYou're in Norway, where everybody speaks English very proficiently. Your native language in English, so that's what you speak in your home. Your son's girlfriend isn't being excluded from the conversation by speaking English.\n\nNow, if you were speaking a language that she really didn't understand, I would perhaps see some reason to accommodate.", "I'm not sure how we can avoid coming down harshly on the young couple. They're telling someone how they should speak in their own home, knowing full well that everyone can communicate perfectly fine, knowing full well that nobody is bullying anyone. That type of demand is incredibly rude and has racist and nationalistic overtones. They know all of that, but they still made the demand to the foreigner.\n\nRacism plus nationalism plus demands of someone else in their own home all looks like a****** territory to me.", "This comment \ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "I'm in a...somewhat(?) similar situation: A good friend of mine has parents of different nationalities. The mother is German and pretty much always speaks German with her family, which I don't understand. When I'm over, she still does that, except when addressing me or including me in a \"group conversation\". This is perfectly fine by me because \"son clean your room\" is none of my business to even understand, never thought she was an asshole for that. It's her home, her family, I'm the one \"intruding\".\n\nThis girl, however, understands English well and can respond in Norwegian if she's more comfortable with that. I don't see how it's an asshole thing to do in any way. The problem doesn't seem to be language but shyness. NTA from me.", "He isn't her host though. She is visiting his son and now wants to impose on him despite understanding the language.", "If someone who understands and speaks your language has an issue with you using said language because you're in their country then that person is the problem.

Many years ago, I was part of a local German wind orchestra while my dad was stationed there. I found out about it when they were hosting a school from upstate NY and posted on base that they needed some families to house some of the students, and shortly after I joined the wind orchestra. This was in the winter, and by the summer the school was returning the favor and I got to travel back Stateside with my fellow bandmates. Well, after I got off the bus that brought us to the town, I, and the rest of us, were greeted by the parents speaking very slowly and loudly at us, thinking it would help us understand them better. The look on their faces when I told them I'm originally from Virginia was priceless, but I then proceeded to let them know that all of the band members understand English very well, and that they don't need to be loud and dumb it down for them. But I also let them know that there were some members who are a bit self-conscious about their English, and to be patient with them. Overall, everyone had a good time. But unfortunately for me, as I was young and dumb, I let them all practice their English with me the entire time I was in the band, but never practiced my German with them...", "I watched ragnorak on netflix which is in norwegian with english subtitles and i was shocked at how much english just popped up out of nowhere. Its not like here in america. English is very common over there.", "Well in your hypothetical, the mom is speaking a non-native language of the country, so it\u2019s not really a fair comparison is it?\n\nI can literally answer your hypothetical though. I\u2019m American, grew up here, but can speak Turkish fluently and my parents spoke Turkish at home.
