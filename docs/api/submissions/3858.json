I did something similar except most of the stuff wasn\u2019t mine so I just kept one clean set of dishes in my room, and put the rest on the porch.  When roommate got home he had the sack to tell me I was a jerk bc he was just about to do them.  Riiight.  2.5 weeks of stagnant dish water and you were just about to do them now.
