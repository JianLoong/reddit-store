My bio dad did drugs and was all around a thug. My mother took him to court when I was four because when I came back from him having me over the weekend I rolled grass in a leaf and pretended to smoke it because \u201cthat\u2019s what daddy does\u201d. She really only wanted him to get to keep me at my grandparents instead of taking me to random strangers places when he had his parenting time (he didn\u2019t have his own place and couch surfed). But he never even showed up and so she was awarded sole custody by default. After that he would call on my birthday once every few years and randomly show up and want to spend time with me once in a blue moon. Never came to birthday parties, never went to school plays, my high school or college graduation or basically any life event. He\u2019s a relative stranger. I\u2019m 26 now and all of a sudden he\u2019s \u201cfound Jesus\u201d, mended his ways and is getting married. He called and texted multiple times begging me to come to his wedding and how it would mean so much to him if I was there for his big day but all I could think about was that he never came to any of my big days or was any sort of parent at all. He wouldn\u2019t even know what my favorite food was or if I was allergic to anything if you asked him. I ignored everything and didn\u2019t go. But now I feel bad because maybe I\u2019m being bitter and hateful and I should just learn to forgive him.

But it sounds like the way he's doing it is quite self-serving which means you should proceed with caution.", "NTA \n\nHE found God, you found a man who let you down for 20+ years and thinks he deserves your forgiveness as a result. \n\nArnie voice - Jesus forgives. I. Don't. \n\nSend him an event invite to something like your little league final 2006, or the court house on the date of the custody hearing 22 years ago. If he acts confused, be confused right back and let him know you assumed he'd acquired a time machine from the way he was going on. \n\nHe can't demand forgiveness, he has to show you that he can *earn* it. That takes way more than leaving a couple voice messages.", "I'm 48 and I've seen my dad 12 times since I was 11. He's just an acquaintance by now. I give him nothing. He is dead to me.", "NTA\n\nForgiving doesn't mean you have to let him back into your life. Forgiving means releasing your internal toxicity from his behavior when you were a child.\n\nYou can forgive someone but still justifiability refuse to re-engage in a relationship with them. (And is it even re-engagement here? For all intents and purposes, you don't actually know him as a person.) Even a blood relative.", "NTA\n\nLet me guess, his fiancee can't believe he has a child with whom he has no relationship.\n\nNow, in order not to appear to be the abandoning jerk he was - he needs you to show up so he can show her he really was a good guy! See? You're here to celebrate with him!\n\nDon't go. He is reaping what he has sown. You can forgive him, but not have to skip to his lou, especially when he doesn't want any intro meetings or trying to actually speak to you, but just for you to show up publicly to an event.", "NTA.\n\nHe's changed but that doesn't mean you have to forgive him. Only you can decide that.", "NTA. He's a stranger to you. Just decline. If he insists, you don't have to rant. Just tell him he wasn't part of your life, a wedding is not the time to reunite and MAYBE after the wedding you might meet up with him. Because it's true. During a wedding, the couple is not going to have any substantial time with any one particular guest. And this is NOT the time to start getting to know each other. And you are not a prop for his wedding, to be paraded around as if he raised you. \n\n If he's serious about wanting you in his life, he'll respect your decision and back off. If he's not serious, he'll get upset.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being bitter or hateful. You have had no real relationship with this man your entire life. It great that he\u2019s getting his life together but that doesn\u2019t obligate you to forgive and forget 26 years of him not being there for you. Time may heal wounds but this was not the time for you.", "NTA.  Has he really changed?  He calls you out of blue for something HE wants.  Where was he for all the big events that mattered to you!  Would mean just so much to HIM.  Doesn't sound like he's changed all that much.", "NTA: Dude wasn't a parent and is essentially a stranger you share genes with.  You aren't obligated in this circumstance.\n\nEven if this is a genuine attempt to connect, a wedding is not the place to do it.  Too much risk of outside issues.", "NTA.  He was never a father to you-- you had every right to say no and to not attend.  Deadbeats have a funny way of wanting to play parent once the hard work and financial obligations of parenting have eased up.\n\nAlso, there's nothing worse than a jerk who has found Jesus.  Jesus may love and forgive him, but no one else has to.", "NTA - all of those ignored life events meant something to you. He invited you to his big life event but didn\u2019t apologize to you for missing your life and not having a relationship. He found Jesus or something but only invited you for appearances. It was selfish on his part. He\u2019s like a dry drunk, stopped drinking but still doesn\u2019t understand what they did or did not do hurt other people.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to be bitter.", "NTA. You are not obligated to attend your bio dad's wedding or respond to his calls and texts. He was not a part of your life for most of it and he did not show any interest or care for you. \n\nHe does not get to demand your presence or attention now that he has supposedly changed. \n\nYou are not being bitter or hateful, you are just protecting yourself from someone who hurt you and abandoned you.\n\nForgiveness is not something that can be forced or expected, it is something that you can choose to do if and when you are ready.", "NTA.  He was absent through most of your life.  You owed him nothing when he recently got married.\n\nHowever, since you're already judging yourself, you don't really need our judgement.  I'd recommend some therapy to, in your words, \"*just learn to forgive him*.\"", "NTA.  It sounds like he only reached out to have you at the wedding.  Maybe as an attempt to show what an outstanding family man he is now.\n\nIt doesn't seem as if he has shown you true remorse or even tried to connect with you on a personal level.  Whether you forgive him is entirely up to you.  However, I would expect a little more effort on his part to EARN that forgiveness.", "NTA, good for him for turning his life around, but you dont owe him forgiveness or reconciliation.\n\nIt would probably be healthier for you to try and make some attempt at reconciliation and to move past his previous behaviour and forgive him but you are NTA if you dont want to", "NTA you don\u2019t owe him anything. If he\u2019d wanted a relationship with you he\u2019d have made more of an effort earlier: he just wants to play happy families in front of his new wife and use you as a prop to do it. It sounds like you\u2019ve done great so far without him and you shouldn\u2019t have to give love to someone who didn\u2019t show any to you", "If he's serious, he'll want a relationship with you *outside of when it makes him like like a good family man*. If he doesn't show up for just you, you know it's not sincere.\n\nNTA", "He turned his life around. Great! That doesn't mean that the devastation caused by his tornado of bad parenting isn't still there while you're left behind picking up the pieces of your broken childhood. You owe him nothing and if you ever decide to give him the time of day again, let it be on your terms. NTA, not even a little bit.", "NTA\n\nHe can't expect him changing to suddenly make up for all the bad. You're still hurting and that doesn't go away with the flip of a switch. \n\nHowever if he truly is trying to right his wrongs I would give him the chance to try to build a relationship with you over time. Drugs are a terrible thing and they truly rob a person of themselves, their family, and everything. I'm not saying it's an excuse....but it's an explanation. Quitting drugs isn't easy once you're started. Some people it takes them years and years to come clean....and some never do. Be glad he found sobriety now and be supportive, because what he did was super hard and better late than never. Again, that doesn't excuse the past but it's reason to give him a chance in the future.", "NTA for not going to his wedding, but you could have used this chance for closure, get everything off your chest, and tell him why you\u2019re not gonna and how he messed up as a deadbeat father, even if you cut him out for the rest of your life.", "This is a big question to ask reddit, and ultimately comes back to what you want for the rest of your life.  You're 26 years old, your dad around 45, both of you most likely have decades of life ahead of them...how do you want to live them?  Are the 26 years of pain and missed events such an insurmountable betrayal and hurt for you that you are unwilling to spend the next 50 working to repair those wounds?

But to all of a sudden say come to my wedding - he just hasn\u2019t earned your time. Sounds more like having you at the wedding looks better for him vs caring about your attendance. \n\nI\u2019d suggest telling him, if he really wants to reconnect (and you want to as well) call when he has a quiet moment.", "This. If you want to have a relationship with him that's kind of you, but you're not obligated to and he should be respectful of it being on gradual terms of you do choose to proceed. Demanding forgiveness or a relationship without having earned and rebuilt trust is not reasonable.", "I love this! So beautifully petty and I wish OP did this lol.", "I'm a Christian and i second this. While Jesus is forgiving and asks us to forgive we cannot expect or demand the forgiveness of others. We have to accept the consequences of our actions.", "Seriously? Nothing worse? If its helped turn his life around, I\u2019d argue there\u2019s nothing better\u2026.

He was always your parent from the moment you were born and he chose to be absent, or worse, from that role, essentially forfeiting it. \n\nAnd honestly my guess is he\u2019s trying to show off to this new wife how great he is and doesn\u2019t want to look bad for\u2026doing something that makes him look bad. I doubt he genuinely wants a connection, or rather maybe he does but only because it benefits him now.", "NTA. Finding Jesus doesn't mean everyone has to forgive him. He abandoned you and you don't owe him or his jesus anything.", "NTA. He doesn't suddenly get to decide to have you in his life. Where was he all those years when you needed him?\n\nI have a sneaky suspicion he's only invited you to his wedding to save face. I bet people are asking him where his kid is.\n\nOP, please don't. I'm afraid you'll have your heart broken again, and for what? It's not worth it.", "Your father wasn't present in your life after age 4.\n\nYour are now 26.  This person wanted you to attend his wedding.  He is a stranger to you.\n\nWould you attend some randoms stranger's wedding?\n\nYou two have-not reconciled.  Celebrations, parties are not for reconciliations.\n\nReconciliations should rake place on neutral grounds, and slowly.\n\nNTA", "Why do you even care about his opinion? Like you said he\u2019s a complete stranger, any this he does is inconsequential to you and vice versa.", "NTA, but consider this - Do you want to wonder what if for the rest of your life?  How much does it cost you to go to the wedding?  If he has another child out of the marriage and you would have a half-sibling, do you want a relationship with them?  Even if its just so if he pulls the deadbeat dad thing on them you can be there for them?  \n\nMy bio father died six years ago now.  When my stepmother (who I've spoken to maybe four times in 37 years) asked me to deal with his remains ect. You know what my response was?  Roll him in a ditch for all I care, he hasn't been my father for 30 years.\n\nI never got an invitation to their wedding.  If I had and my father said, look I was a terrible dad, I have ADHD and I never got treated, now I got treated, and I found God.  Please let me show you I've changed.  I likely would have gone.  But it would have been his last chance.\n\nBasically let me sum up my reasoning:  He claims to have changed.  If he has never made this claim before, then maybe he has.  You don't owe him another chance, but you owe yourself one.  This isn't about him.  It is about you.  A parent, a new step parent, those are possible supports for you in the future.  His side of the family will be there likely, even more possible support.  If he has changed he might be there for you at some point down the road.  If he hasn't he won't be.  Either way, all this costs you is a dress and the time for the wedding.\n\nPersonally I say, take the free meal and see how it turns out.", "NTA. However maybe try to go to the wedding. Do not live life with any regrets, and this might become one down the line. Though only you can really not that for sure.", "Some things can't be forgiven. And they don't suddenly become forgiven because that person \"claims\" theyve found god, or changed, or attoned etc. \n\nYou didn't have to go to the wedding, and you don't have to have anything to do with him now if you don't want.  You owe him nothing if you don't wish to.", "NTA.  Why do people think that suddenly \"finding God\" means that you automatically deserve forgiveness?!  Frankly, most of the worst people that I've ever met in my life go to church every Sunday.  You don't owe him anything.  If he wants to try and prove to you somehow that he's changed, then that's for him to do.  And if you don't want to accept that, that's perfectly fine too!  As someone below quoted - \"Jesus forgives - I don't\".", "NTA  \n  \n>I\u2019m 26 now and all of a sudden he\u2019s \u201cfound Jesus\u201d, mended his ways and is getting married..... But now I feel bad because maybe I\u2019m being bitter and hateful and I should just learn to forgive him.   \n  \nIf he wants forgiveness, he needs to talk to Jesus because you have no reason whatsoever to forgive him.    \n  \nThis dude is a sperm donor, nothing more.  He's not your father, he's just some random guy that invited you to his wedding.", "NTA.  The time for reconciliation isn't a wedding.", "Yeah I feel like he shouldve started way before the wedding with something small. Jumping to some conclusions here, but I assume his SO is probably someone who is also in the Jesus community, so there was like at least a year or two before the wedding where he could've reached out", "I'd go as far as to add a set of questions about yourself (favourite colour, favourite food, college major... basic stuff) and refuse any further communication if he doesn't answer it right. Forgiveness is earned, not demanded. OP, NTA.", "This is it exactly.  Trying to show his fiancee that he wasn't a deadbeat dad for years.", "Useless he shows up to the reception afterwards, and asks every other person,  'could you point out my dad, the groom, I've no idea which one he is and I have this card for him.'", "Well the wedding has already come and gone. I just couldn\u2019t do it. It wasn\u2019t even just him who abandoned me, everyone of his side of the family just cut me out when he did. So I really didn\u2019t want to see any of them either. And it was more than just abandonment he used to leave me alone in strangers houses for hours while he went out and did drugs and partied. He\u2019s the reason I have some really bad anxiety and depression issues. And to be honest I just don\u2019t have any room left for disappointment. My mom and my stepdad (who I consider my real dad) got an ugly divorce about four years ago and she remarried. I just got step siblings and honestly I don\u2019t want any more. My family situation is so convoluted I hate when people ask me any questions and most of all I hate having to explain why my last name is different than any other person in my families because my mom never changed it from bio dads last name.", "All fair points.  Usually in situations like you're in there are no right answers, or actions.  Only ones that are right for you and that  you can live with.\n\nYou can pile blame on him/his family.  Being bitter about all of it won't help you.  You still sound very angry about it all.  Take it from me, it doesn't help your or anyone around you.\n\nI'm an old lady now.  So I'm going to tell you a story because it is what cranky old ladies do.\n\nWhen I was ten, my family doctor told my mother (and this is super rare for girls with ADHD).  I think Kivrinjk has ADD.  There are treatments for it, you should get her tested.  My mother says, made up thing.  So 30+ years later my doctor is looking at anti-depressants for me, that have never worked in the past.  And she's suddenly like, do you think you might have ADHD?  I was like maybe?  So got diagnosed.\n\nSo for 30+ years, university, college, multiple jobs I've just wandered away from.  Financial life in chaos, all sorts of anxiety and trauma, life long suffering and like 70% of it could have been avoided if my mom had just said, sure lets do that instead of calling my disability made up?\n\nShe died about eight months before I was diagnosed officially.  I was so pissed I almost threw her ashes in the garbage.  I was furious, then bitter and so many other things.   I wasn't really alright about any of it until my husband sat me down and was like, you can't change any of it.  Even if your mother was alive, yelling at her wouldn't change any of it.  So forgive her and move on.  You're angry with a memory.  I did the same thing with my father, I just dumped all of that bitterness, anger, rage and hate.\n\nEven if its in the twilight of my life I'm much happier for it.  I'm not saying go talk to your dad.  I'm just saying go no contact, pretend he is dead.  Forgive and forget him.", "It does but only if you're truly ready to forgive. There are some things that take more time to heal 1st. Some things never heal.", "I can only speak for myself, but I know I\u2019ve been molested as a 5 year old. I put the family member in jail and he got out when I was 25-ish. When he tried to come back to family it was a whole thing, but I confronted him terrified. We talked and it was hella awkward, but he did beg for forgiveness. \n\nIt took time, but eventually I got to a point where I felt that while it was part of my story, it no longer burdened me. It simply just takes too much effort to hang on to the anger and hate. \n\nThat\u2019s all I mean, not that it is always possible for everyone in all circumstances.", "Nta stay away.  You weren't important enough for him to be there on any of your big days.  Now he wants you at his wedding.  Probably to put on a show to make him look good.  Nope.  Avoid him.", "NTA bet what really wanted was you to act as a prop and put on a show so he could appear to be a great dad", "NTA. This man is a stranger to you. You have no responsibility/obligation to have attended his wedding or have any further relationship with him if you don't want to. If he wants to try to build a relationship with you now, he can reach out and ask, but you are well within your rights to say no. For him to go from no contact to inviting you to his wedding means he wanted the reward without any of the effort.", "NTA. It's great he is turning his life around, but that has nothing to do with you or the past 26 years. You have no obligation to forgive and forget, especially since he hasn't really made any kind of effort to make up for anything, he's just trying to get you at his wedding so he can show of his kid he had nothing to do with other then genetic material donation.  If he were making a real effort, if you felt he really was trying to make up to you and allowing you your boundaries, etc, well, that might be different. However, even that you'd still not be TA because like I said, you don't have to do squat to make him feel better. It's not your cross to bear, it's his. Luck to you, my friend.", "NTA.  Just because he \"found Jesus\" does not mean you need to forgive him.  Your forgiveness is up to you.  And in my experience people who spend lots of their lives as assholes and then \"find Jesus\" are usually intolerable anyway.", "NTA   It's not bitter or hateful to close a chapter and move on.  It's actually very healthy to know your boundaries and not let people tread all over them.  You did just fine!!", "NTA wedding invitations are not jury summons. You don't have to go to ones to people you don't have a relationship with. You also don't have to show up to be a prop to show how \"good a father he is,\" \"oh look how his child loves him,\" or whatever lies he told to his fiance and other people at church about his relationship with you. Feel free to block him for as long as he was missing from your life till now.", "If he has been improving his life through religion then good for him.  I'm guessing though that he's getting pressure from his bride to be's family because absolutely no one from his side will be going to the wedding.  I wouldn't take him at his word, if you're uncomfortable going, don't go.  I wouldn't cut him out at this point, I'd at least give him another chance with a small lunch or something.  NTAH though.", "Heck, in our culture I wouldn't be surprised that he hadn't found jesus at all but is using that as a weapon.

I need a hug!\"", "It doesn't sound like he's changed at all, still only thinking about what HE wants, what HE needs. He doesn't even know his own kid in the slightest.", "NTA if he really cares he would have tried to work on building a relationship with you slowly over time. Instead he invited you to his wedding, where he would have little time to talk with you. It\u2019s obvious you were meant to sit at his table like a good little soldier so he could uphold this new mask of goodness that he has put on. He is still the same selfish man he ever was.", "What's he been doing with his time? He didn't try contact you to mend that relationship during the period between \"Found Jesus\" and calling you about his wedding.\n\nLet's say he turned his life around on January 1st & called you February 1st (being conservative). What did he do to build a relationship with you during that month? Nothing. \n\nThis call was performative for his own entitled, self-centered reasons. NTA.

A few years ago he wanted me to go to some party for his father & I said no. I\u2019ll do the random contact with him now but he\u2019s not going to parade me & my son around like he\u2019s been involved in our lives every month.", "NTA go no contact with him. Block him.

He\u2019d put in 26 years of work for it. His demands of you attending the wedding were 110% self-serving. It was not about having YOU there on his \u201cbig day\u201d now that he\u2019s \u201cfound Jesus\u201d it was about HIM looking like he had a relationship with you and has come all this way\u2026 blah blah blah \n\nNTA. God, 1,000% NTA. I\u2019m curious, how has his communication been since the wedding? I assume he will gaslight and guilt trip you, so I would proceed with caution. If he insists on a relationship, and is a true recovered addict, he will work the steps from the program and be patient while working to build your trust. Either way, think about what you want from the relationship and lay out those expectations for him - even if it\u2019s to never contact you again. Be patient and kind to yourself!", "NTA\n\nIt's okay to recognize it's too late. You did want a dad, sadly you didn't have one--and now you're grown up and don't need one. Why would you give him a chance when he's consistently let you down? Even a random stranger would be more likely to do better.\n\nI grieved the relationship I wished I'd had with my mom, and when she suddenly expected to be friends with adult me I was aloof. She'll never understand why, but to me it's just too late. She had 18 years of chances and I don't feel like letting her disappoint me for 18 more.

You owe him nothing.", "This reads like the lyrics from Weezer's \"Say it ain't so\"", "We don\u2019t know anything about it.

If you don't want to go because he's a stranger to you (except biologically) then you have nothing to worry about.

Because it's still all about what he wants and he doesn't give a rat's ass about what you want.\n\nI'm not saying don't forgive him.
