My bio dad did drugs and was all around a thug. My mother took him to court when I was four because when I came back from him having me over the weekend I rolled grass in a leaf and pretended to smoke it because \u201cthat\u2019s what daddy does\u201d. She really only wanted him to get to keep me at my grandparents instead of taking me to random strangers places when he had his parenting time (he didn\u2019t have his own place and couch surfed). But he never even showed up and so she was awarded sole custody by default. After that he would call on my birthday once every few years and randomly show up and want to spend time with me once in a blue moon. Never came to birthday parties, never went to school plays, my high school or college graduation or basically any life event. He\u2019s a relative stranger. I\u2019m 26 now and all of a sudden he\u2019s \u201cfound Jesus\u201d, mended his ways and is getting married. He called and texted multiple times begging me to come to his wedding and how it would mean so much to him if I was there for his big day but all I could think about was that he never came to any of my big days or was any sort of parent at all. He wouldn\u2019t even know what my favorite food was or if I was allergic to anything if you asked him. I ignored everything and didn\u2019t go. But now I feel bad because maybe I\u2019m being bitter and hateful and I should just learn to forgive him. So I need a third party opinion.", "created_utc": 1690562802, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c2mbz/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_my_bio_dads_wedding/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But it sounds like the way he's doing it is quite self-serving which means you should proceed with caution.", "NTA \n\nHE found God, you found a man who let you down for 20+ years and thinks he deserves your forgiveness as a result. \n\nArnie voice - Jesus forgives. I. Don't. \n\nSend him an event invite to something like your little league final 2006, or the court house on the date of the custody hearing 22 years ago. If he acts confused, be confused right back and let him know you assumed he'd acquired a time machine from the way he was going on. \n\nHe can't demand forgiveness, he has to show you that he can *earn* it. That takes way more than leaving a couple voice messages.", "I'm 48 and I've seen my dad 12 times since I was 11. He's just an acquaintance by now. I give him nothing. He is dead to me.", "NTA\n\nForgiving doesn't mean you have to let him back into your life. Forgiving means releasing your internal toxicity from his behavior when you were a child.\n\nYou can forgive someone but still justifiability refuse to re-engage in a relationship with them. (And is it even re-engagement here? For all intents and purposes, you don't actually know him as a person.) Even a blood relative.", "NTA\n\nLet me guess, his fiancee can't believe he has a child with whom he has no relationship.\n\nNow, in order not to appear to be the abandoning jerk he was - he needs you to show up so he can show her he really was a good guy! See? You're here to celebrate with him!\n\nDon't go. He is reaping what he has sown. You can forgive him, but not have to skip to his lou, especially when he doesn't want any intro meetings or trying to actually speak to you, but just for you to show up publicly to an event.", "NTA.\n\nHe's changed but that doesn't mean you have to forgive him. Only you can decide that.", "NTA. He's a stranger to you. Just decline. If he insists, you don't have to rant. Just tell him he wasn't part of your life, a wedding is not the time to reunite and MAYBE after the wedding you might meet up with him. Because it's true. During a wedding, the couple is not going to have any substantial time with any one particular guest. And this is NOT the time to start getting to know each other. And you are not a prop for his wedding, to be paraded around as if he raised you. \n\n If he's serious about wanting you in his life, he'll respect your decision and back off. If he's not serious, he'll get upset.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being bitter or hateful. You have had no real relationship with this man your entire life. It great that he\u2019s getting his life together but that doesn\u2019t obligate you to forgive and forget 26 years of him not being there for you. Time may heal wounds but this was not the time for you.", "NTA.  Has he really changed?  He calls you out of blue for something HE wants.  Where was he for all the big events that mattered to you!  Would mean just so much to HIM.  Doesn't sound like he's changed all that much.", "NTA: Dude wasn't a parent and is essentially a stranger you share genes with.  You aren't obligated in this circumstance.\n\nEven if this is a genuine attempt to connect, a wedding is not the place to do it.  Too much risk of outside issues.", "NTA.  He was never a father to you-- you had every right to say no and to not attend.  Deadbeats have a funny way of wanting to play parent once the hard work and financial obligations of parenting have eased up.\n\nAlso, there's nothing worse than a jerk who has found Jesus.  Jesus may love and forgive him, but no one else has to.", "NTA - all of those ignored life events meant something to you. He invited you to his big life event but didn\u2019t apologize to you for missing your life and not having a relationship. He found Jesus or something but only invited you for appearances. It was selfish on his part. He\u2019s like a dry drunk, stopped drinking but still doesn\u2019t understand what they did or did not do hurt other people.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to be bitter.", "NTA. You are not obligated to attend your bio dad's wedding or respond to his calls and texts. He was not a part of your life for most of it and he did not show any interest or care for you. \n\nHe does not get to demand your presence or attention now that he has supposedly changed. \n\nYou are not being bitter or hateful, you are just protecting yourself from someone who hurt you and abandoned you.\n\nForgiveness is not something that can be forced or expected, it is something that you can choose to do if and when you are ready.", "NTA.  He was absent through most of your life.  You owed him nothing when he recently got married.\n\nHowever, since you're already judging yourself, you don't really need our judgement.  I'd recommend some therapy to, in your words, \"*just learn to forgive him*.\"", "NTA.  It sounds like he only reached out to have you at the wedding.  Maybe as an attempt to show what an outstanding family man he is now.\n\nIt doesn't seem as if he has shown you true remorse or even tried to connect with you on a personal level.  Whether you forgive him is entirely up to you.  However, I would expect a little more effort on his part to EARN that forgiveness.", "NTA, good for him for turning his life around, but you dont owe him forgiveness or reconciliation.\n\nIt would probably be healthier for you to try and make some attempt at reconciliation and to move past his previous behaviour and forgive him but you are NTA if you dont want to", "NTA you don\u2019t owe him anything. If he\u2019d wanted a relationship with you he\u2019d have made more of an effort earlier: he just wants to play happy families in front of his new wife and use you as a prop to do it. It sounds like you\u2019ve done great so far without him and you shouldn\u2019t have to give love to someone who didn\u2019t show any to you", "If he's serious, he'll want a relationship with you *outside of when it makes him like like a good family man*. If he doesn't show up for just you, you know it's not sincere.\n\nNTA", "He turned his life around. Great! That doesn't mean that the devastation caused by his tornado of bad parenting isn't still there while you're left behind picking up the pieces of your broken childhood. You owe him nothing and if you ever decide to give him the time of day again, let it be on your terms. NTA, not even a little bit.", "NTA\n\nHe can't expect him changing to suddenly make up for all the bad. You're still hurting and that doesn't go away with the flip of a switch. \n\nHowever if he truly is trying to right his wrongs I would give him the chance to try to build a relationship with you over time. Drugs are a terrible thing and they truly rob a person of themselves, their family, and everything. I'm not saying it's an excuse....but it's an explanation. Quitting drugs isn't easy once you're started. Some people it takes them years and years to come clean....and some never do. Be glad he found sobriety now and be supportive, because what he did was super hard and better late than never. Again, that doesn't excuse the past but it's reason to give him a chance in the future.", "NTA for not going to his wedding, but you could have used this chance for closure, get everything off your chest, and tell him why you\u2019re not gonna and how he messed up as a deadbeat father, even if you cut him out for the rest of your life.", "This is a big question to ask reddit, and ultimately comes back to what you want for the rest of your life.  You're 26 years old, your dad around 45, both of you most likely have decades of life ahead of them...how do you want to live them?  Are the 26 years of pain and missed events such an insurmountable betrayal and hurt for you that you are unwilling to spend the next 50 working to repair those wounds?  You're NTA for your feelings, abandonment at any age is hard, at 4 it's tragic.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm not religious so I apologize if this offends, but if he couldn't get his shit together for his kid but could do it for some dude that's been dead for eons, he's not worth knowing.", "NTA Seems to me if he cared so much he would have tried to reach out and talk to you first. But to all of a sudden say come to my wedding - he just hasn\u2019t earned your time. Sounds more like having you at the wedding looks better for him vs caring about your attendance. \n\nI\u2019d suggest telling him, if he really wants to reconnect (and you want to as well) call when he has a quiet moment.", "This. If you want to have a relationship with him that's kind of you, but you're not obligated to and he should be respectful of it being on gradual terms of you do choose to proceed. Demanding forgiveness or a relationship without having earned and rebuilt trust is not reasonable.", "I love this! So beautifully petty and I wish OP did this lol.", "I'm a Christian and i second this. While Jesus is forgiving and asks us to forgive we cannot expect or demand the forgiveness of others. We have to accept the consequences of our actions.", "Seriously? Nothing worse? If its helped turn his life around, I\u2019d argue there\u2019s nothing better\u2026. That said, you\u2019re right no one else has to forgive him. But unlike prior, at least the dad is trying now even if its too late for OP to accept", "I don't think that will get closure. It rarely does.", "But forgiving, truly forgiving, lifts a weight off your shoulders in a way you didn't think possible.", "I guess closure isn\u2019t what I was suggesting\u2026 more in lines with having the last word before shutting him out.", "That doesn't apply to all things.\n\nSomethings are beyond any forgiveness.", "Nah. It always sounds better in your head than in reality."]}
