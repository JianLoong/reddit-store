Her blowing up at you and accusing you of making your whole life revolve around your son because you don\u2019t want to leave him with people you don\u2019t know makes her an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nIn my opinion, **you handled this just right**. It doesn't seem like you blew up at her or did anything mean. You shared a simple constraint (I can't come without my baby), and when she said no you accepted it.\n\nIt's okay for the bride and groom to put restrictions on their wedding. No children. No alcohol. No meat. Whatever! Same with destination weddings. But they should realize that their restrictions or requirements may have consequences. Some people will choose not to come. And that's fine to. Bride and groom get to set rules, guests get to decide if they show up. All good!", "NTA. She can't have it both ways. If your whole family is at the wedding, and you don't have friends to support or a sitter you trust, there isn't a whole lot else you can do.

Understandable that your sister wants you there, but she's suggesting you leave a baby with strangers. When you have a child free wedding you have to accept that some people won't be able to come because of their kids.", "NTA-\n\nYou kindly asked for your baby to come,she\u2019s NTA for not wanting to make an exception as that\u2019s really unfair to the other guests who have to pay for a babysitter but she really didn\u2019t need to cause a scene.

She set rules, which is fine. You told her you cannot go and still abide by her rules, also fine.

Your sister is being unreasonable and you handled the situation well.", "NTA. \n\nSister is not an AH for having a child-free wedding. You are not for asking for an exception.

Sister does not realise that wedding invitations are *invitations*, not summons.", "NTA.\n\nInvitations are not summons.\n\nYou asked, she said no.

It's a baby. If it cries, it can be taken in another room. Our cousin's baby was probably the best dressed dude there, he even had a little tweed hat, and he enjoyed being passed around.

If your son is NOT more important than your sister .  .  .  .  .  then you got a problem.", "NTA. Some brides hire a nanny to watch some kids during the wedding. Your sister isn\u2019t doing that.

She\u2019s an AH for insisting you do.", "If people want child free weddings, that\u2019s absolutely fine, but they have to understand that not everyone can come.

For a sibling\u2019s wedding, I would make a strong effort to attend.\n\nEdited to add: I didn\u2019t realize he was so young. A one month old is so young!

You asked, you were told no, and so you can't go.", "NTA, i wanted a child free wedding also, but if my sister just had a baby, I would make the exception. Babies aren\u2019t the issue at weddings, its the toddlers-pre teens that can be a lot to handle.", "When you have a child free wedding, part of it is accepting that people with the baby won\u2019t come.

Otherwise,I can't come as I can't find babysitters I trust that are available then.\" than someone who just shows up with the kid.\n\nLook at it logically: it is a terrible idea to leave a baby with someone you don't trust completely. So your options are bring the baby or don't go, so you showed the bride your options and she's complaining about you putting the wellbeing/safety of your baby above her wedding. The aunt of the baby saying leave the baby with a pretty much stranger?

There was nothing wrong with asking, and a polite \u201cno\u201d should have sufficed. Your sister is foolish to pressure you to allow total strangers to babysit your baby. A parent\u2019s life literally does revolve around a baby.\n\nI honestly think the proliferation of child-free weddings is the latest fad that inconveniences guests. Before that, destination weddings skyrocketed. Most relatives were excluded from destination weddings, and it was not uncommon for brides to expect her few guests to pay to get to those exotic locations. \n\nIn my parents\u2019 generation, everyone got married in a church, synagogue, mosque, or courthouse, and then there was a reception at the bride\u2019s parents\u2019 house. It was a family celebration, that did not break the bank. In my day, we used wedding venues or houses of worship, with a reception hall afterward. Only wealthy people threw extravagant weddings. Now, many weddings seem to be trying to approximate an event thrown for a wealthy socialite or actress. The expense is staggering, Bridezillas are more common, and now child-free is a thing. Child-free used to mean if your child cries, take him out of church so as not to disrupt the ceremony. Now, brides either pressure parents to dump their kids somewhere, sometimes for a week if it\u2019s a child-free destination wedding, or out of town, or the alternative. Parents who can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, leave their kids with a sitter miss out on the weddings of family members. \n\nIt shuts out young relatives from major family events. I adored going to weddings as a kid. I still remember a beautiful bride teaching me how to waltz when I was little. The message sent by child-free weddings is that kids, and families, are not welcome.\n\nIt\u2019s her wedding, and she can plan it however she wants. Tell her that if she chooses to have a child-free wedding, then she needs to gracefully accept that some relatives with children will have to decline to attend. \n\nIf anything happened to your baby while you were gone, you\u2019d spend the rest of your life regretting attending. \n\nDon\u2019t go. Let your sister be the Main Event with her friends who don\u2019t have kids, and older relatives, and wish her well. \n\nA crow bar and file of Marines couldn\u2019t separate me from my baby for total strangers to babysit.

It's a part of your biology. If you don't feed, bad things start to happen. At one month, that baby is feeding every two hours. She would have to stop and pump every two hours. Doing so at this age would also alter the milk. It's like a whole big deal.   \n\n\nOne month old babies are basically in their fourth trimester of being a fetus. They are very attached to the mom.

Sorry, this could be cultural, are you American? I live in Europe and I think parenting is just a bit more chill here.

Sure, it could happen, but it doesn't mean it's probable it would. By that logic you could argue that the baby could spontaneously selfcombust, since \"literally anything could happen\".
