It doesn't seem like you blew up at her or did anything mean. You shared a simple constraint (I can't come without my baby), and when she said no you accepted it.\n\nIt's okay for the bride and groom to put restrictions on their wedding. No children. No alcohol. No meat. Whatever! Same with destination weddings. But they should realize that their restrictions or requirements may have consequences. Some people will choose not to come. And that's fine to. Bride and groom get to set rules, guests get to decide if they show up. All good!", "NTA. She can't have it both ways. If your whole family is at the wedding, and you don't have friends to support or a sitter you trust, there isn't a whole lot else you can do.

Understandable that your sister wants you there, but she's suggesting you leave a baby with strangers. When you have a child free wedding you have to accept that some people won't be able to come because of their kids.", "NTA-\n\nYou kindly asked for your baby to come,she\u2019s NTA for not wanting to make an exception as that\u2019s really unfair to the other guests who have to pay for a babysitter but she really didn\u2019t need to cause a scene.

She set rules, which is fine. You told her you cannot go and still abide by her rules, also fine.

Your sister is being unreasonable and you handled the situation well.", "NTA. \n\nSister is not an AH for having a child-free wedding. You are not for asking for an exception.

It's a baby. If it cries, it can be taken in another room. Our cousin's baby was probably the best dressed dude there, he even had a little tweed hat, and he enjoyed being passed around.

She\u2019s an AH for insisting you do.", "If people want child free weddings, that\u2019s absolutely fine, but they have to understand that not everyone can come.

Otherwise,I can't come as I can't find babysitters I trust that are available then.\" than someone who just shows up with the kid.\n\nLook at it logically: it is a terrible idea to leave a baby with someone you don't trust completely. So your options are bring the baby or don't go, so you showed the bride your options and she's complaining about you putting the wellbeing/safety of your baby above her wedding. The aunt of the baby saying leave the baby with a pretty much stranger?

There was nothing wrong with asking, and a polite \u201cno\u201d should have sufficed. Your sister is foolish to pressure you to allow total strangers to babysit your baby. A parent\u2019s life literally does revolve around a baby.\n\nI honestly think the proliferation of child-free weddings is the latest fad that inconveniences guests. Before that, destination weddings skyrocketed. Most relatives were excluded from destination weddings, and it was not uncommon for brides to expect her few guests to pay to get to those exotic locations. \n\nIn my parents\u2019 generation, everyone got married in a church, synagogue, mosque, or courthouse, and then there was a reception at the bride\u2019s parents\u2019 house. It was a family celebration, that did not break the bank. In my day, we used wedding venues or houses of worship, with a reception hall afterward. Only wealthy people threw extravagant weddings. Now, many weddings seem to be trying to approximate an event thrown for a wealthy socialite or actress. The expense is staggering, Bridezillas are more common, and now child-free is a thing. Child-free used to mean if your child cries, take him out of church so as not to disrupt the ceremony. Now, brides either pressure parents to dump their kids somewhere, sometimes for a week if it\u2019s a child-free destination wedding, or out of town, or the alternative. Parents who can\u2019t, or don\u2019t want to, leave their kids with a sitter miss out on the weddings of family members. \n\nIt shuts out young relatives from major family events. I adored going to weddings as a kid. I still remember a beautiful bride teaching me how to waltz when I was little. The message sent by child-free weddings is that kids, and families, are not welcome.\n\nIt\u2019s her wedding, and she can plan it however she wants. Tell her that if she chooses to have a child-free wedding, then she needs to gracefully accept that some relatives with children will have to decline to attend. \n\nIf anything happened to your baby while you were gone, you\u2019d spend the rest of your life regretting attending. \n\nDon\u2019t go. Let your sister be the Main Event with her friends who don\u2019t have kids, and older relatives, and wish her well. \n\nA crow bar and file of Marines couldn\u2019t separate me from my baby for total strangers to babysit.

A baby isn't eating any of the food, either!", "IMO any child who is being problematic can be removed in the same way as an infant, although for sure an older kid is more likely to get bored and antsy whereas a newborn is easier to entertain.", "That makes a lot of sense.", "i get why people have child free weddings, but i truly do not understand excluding members of your own family. your sister's kids are not in the same category as other random guests' kids. \n\nweddings are about joining two families and creating a new family. i just don't understand why you wouldn't want to include these very important people in that celebration.", "It is a pain in the ass. I would let a teenager or pretty much any trustworthy adult babysit my 6 year old now (though I haven't aside from gym childcare or structured classes, because dates are expensive enough without having to pay $15 an hour on top of it), because she is very vocal about what she needs, pretty self-reliant with most care tasks, and really only would need someone to hang out with for a bit. That said, when she was still an infant up through probably 2? Absolutely not. She had very specific routines around sleeping, napping, diapering, and eating, and if they went badly, it would ruin the next full day at least. Also, I was SA'd by a teenage babysitter as a 4 year old while my 2 year old brother was locked in a bathroom, so I'm definitely wary.", "I definitely think that the possibility exists that instructions on a pre-printed invitation might not apply to the bride\u2019s sister. Baby is only a month old FFS. It\u2019s ok for the bride to stick to the \u201cno kids\u201d but it\u2019s also ok for the sister to clarify. Who would want to miss their sister\u2019s wedding??? \n\nIt\u2019s mind blowing to me that some of you think the sister should just say \u201coh, no kids? Ok, I won\u2019t go.\u201d without any effort to clarify.\n\nI can easily imagine another scenario where a bride is saying \u201cmy sister RSVP\u2019d no without ever clarifying with me! Of course the newborn would\u2019ve been able to come if excluding him meant my sister couldn\u2019t attend. I\u2019m so hurt that she never talked to me about it\u201d", "Considering how spoiled and immature her sister sounds, yes, I do think she could have forgotten or purposefully not cared about her nephew. The only thing that made this awkward and intense was the sister\u2019s immediate over-the-top response to being asked a simple clarifying question. A 26-year-old woman should not immediately start screaming at her sister (who she supposedly desperately wants at her wedding) and throw a tantrum because her sister is uncomfortable leaving her infant with people she doesn\u2019t know very well to come to her precious wedding. If she doesn\u2019t want any children at her wedding, that\u2019s fine, but that does mean that some people will not be able to make it, whether she agrees with their reason or not. Her reaction was completely childish and uncalled for and makes her a major a-hole.", "I cannot believe all the NTA\u2019s. No way is OP telling us even half the story. She doesn\u2019t want to go to her sisters wedding, end of.", "You\u2019re welcome! Not to mention the extra fee of seating when it comes to adding kids into the guest list! \n\nI had a microwedding during Covid (50 people) and only had 1 child there, our flower girl who was my MOH and the officiant\u2019s child, so we could make sure our immediate and closest family members could be there.", "That\u2019s probably the most common reason for child free weddings.", "Every wedding I had ever been to with kids at it, a child broke something, and it was almost always something the bride and groom had put out special for their relationship. \n\nWe did a child free (aside from my blood related siblings) wedding because of this. But the catch was, babies under a year, and \u201cchildren\u201d over 16 were allowed to attend. \n\nWe caught alllll kinds of flack from people\u2026 but only people who had warned us in advance they likely wouldn\u2019t be able to attend because of work/distance \ud83d\ude44", "And yet, parents often don't escort them out, because they don't want to miss out on the event. The result? Situations like my cousin's gorgeous wedding, which was utterly impossible to enjoy over the screeching of an irate toddler.", "Hey maybe you could also read the parenthesis, IN MY EXPERIENCE", "We live an airplane flight away from basically all our family and family friends who are still getting married (most of our friends locally are already married with kids). Let alone expenses I don\u2019t have built in babysitters that can watch my kids overnight. If my mom doesn\u2019t happen to be free and can fly in and kids aren\u2019t allowed, at least one of us can\u2019t go. My husband has been to many weddings without me (his side tends to have more child free weddings). I\u2019ve never held it against anyone but they can\u2019t assume everyone can come if they insist on child free.", "Right, this. I will leave older children with a babysitter but I will only leave a baby with family or people I am close with. I have brought my baby to events that were otherwise child free (with permission.) A baby isn\u2019t running around and shouting. If baby starts whimpering you can easily step out and quiet them.   \n\n\nNot that the sister needs to be ok with baby coming, but it is perfectly reasonable for op to ask about an exception and to decline to attend.", "Most churches have family rooms for crying babies. And if not, you just leave. But also, there are tricks to settle your baby so they don't cry.", "My wedding wasn\u2019t child free either but that was because my husbands culture doesn\u2019t really acknowledge childfree weddings and I got married abroad and had a non traditional wedding. If I ever got married again in my country I\u2019d have a childfree wedding but most of my friends would love that. \n\nKids change the dynamics of weddings completely and at most weddings find it boring and tedious, it\u2019s a long day and they are expected to sit still for a lot of it which most children struggle with. They have to sit quietly through the ceremony and speeches, there is often a long period taking photographs that they have to wait through and I\u2019ve been to lots of weddings where people are drinking and it wasn\u2019t really suitable for kids.\n\nAlso not everyone\u2019s kids are well behaved! I have posted a few times before about a hairdresser who did my hair years ago and whose wedding was completely destroyed by 3 kids in her family she knew wouldn\u2019t behave but was pressured to invite. One child cried through the ceremony and wasn\u2019t taken out, she also tried to get under the bride\u2019s dress when she was saying her vows and juice from a juice box was accidentally squeezed over the dress. The kids ran round during the meal and a little boy grabbed the table cloth to steady himself and pulled over plates and glasses, the staff kept telling the parents it was dangerous when they were carrying food and trays of champagne but were just ignored. They talked and cried during the speeches, the youngest (3 year old) had a massive tantrum that there was no ice cream for dessert. The little boy ran his fingers through the icing on the cake, licked them and carried on doing it, one tier of the cake couldn\u2019t be brought out and served. The kids started dancing when the bride and groom had their first dance and skidding across the dance floor on their knees. They were left to run around and help themselves to the very fancy evening buffet, it was things like oysters, asparagus tarts, crab cakes, mini beef wellingtons etc\u2026 the kids obviously weren\u2019t keen so they were handling the food, trying it and spitting it out or putting it back, a lot of the food got ruined and the buffet was closed early. The parents were drinking and kept expecting everyone else to watch them, one of the bridesmaids spent all day running round after the 3 year old and returning her to her parents.\n\nMy hairdresser was absolutely devastated because she had anticipated that these things might happen. She ended up having a vow renewal on her anniversary. No one apologised to her and the mother of the kids just said she was being uptight and said \u201cthat\u2019s just how kids are.\u201d\n\nChildfree vs child friendly weddings cause a big split in opinion - some people can\u2019t imagine not having children there and very much see it as a family event, some people think weddings aren\u2019t suitable for children. It can be cultural as well of course for some cultures it absolutely is a family and community event. It\u2019s ok to have different opinions, most people are happy for invited guests to decline an invitation if they don\u2019t want to leave their kids, it\u2019s when they try to pressure the bride and groom to change their wedding that there is conflict.", "Exactly, which wouldn't even be a problem in and of itself, until there's people like OP's sister who don't understand you can't (logically/reasonably) leave an infant with people you don't know. Like....???", "The bride thinks that the little kids will take away some attention off of them, and they couldn\u2019t possibly have that happen.", "Even if there was suddenly a viable option, after her sister treats her like crap, I would 100% not go just on principle. You don't get to bully people into celebrating you.", "You'd be surprised how many options people overlook.", "She didn\u2019t say no. She said she only trusts family and they\u2019ll be at the wedding. The dad\u2019s family is family and won\u2019t be at the wedding.", "\u201cVarious\u201d people like the baby\u2019s other grandparents? Oh what must they be thinking! /s \n\nI wouldn\u2019t go, but to imply that asking about the other grandparent/s is pushing it is silly.", "I only asked because she said family is the only one she trusts.  But I agree - OP is NTA here, and she doesn\u2019t have to accept the invite if she cannot adjust her circumstances sufficiently, especially when childcare is involved.", "You really think you can forcibly remove, say, a 5 year old with the ease and lack of fuss or commotion with which you can walk out of the room holding an infant?", "Yeah, that makes sense. I get not wanting random teens to watch your kids (even though I did watch kids as a teen, I get it) but it\u2019s the no one but family ever thing that seems both new and weird. I may just be out of touch, or people on Reddit aren\u2019t a good cross-section. Who knows!", "LOL, yes, diapers are the worst.  I think the youngest kid I babysat would have been a toddler, certainly not an infant. I didn\u2019t actually mean this to apply directly to this situation, it\u2019s just something I\u2019ve been noticing is posts for the last, I dunno, six months to a year? Was wondering if it\u2019s a new thing or I just missed some shift ages ago since I don\u2019t have kids, or really many friends with kids. \n\nMy nephew went to childcare from about 6 months old, and he\u2019s 12 now. I guess i just assumed there were more families where both parents worked or there only one parent, who works. But lately it seems like there have been tons of stay at home parent posts and people saying they would only ever let family watch their kids, and that seems really weird. Maybe just to me!", "Exactly\u2026 or if she is not married to the baby\u2019s father, there could be some jealousy involved as well. She likely wants a disruption by bringing the baby and wants to create drama by saying coolly \u201cokay\u2026 both of us or none\u201d knowing that their parents and other people are going to turn on the bride for her sister\u2019s absence. OP is one of those covert narcissists who creates drama while pretending to be the calm one so other people explode and appear crazy.", "A few others and myself saw a comment stating that. No idea where it is now. Doesnt change anything when you look at the actions of the sister.", "50 people is a microwedding now?", "All of those options require the parents to be cognizant, capable, and courteous enough to actually do something if their babies cry. If the couple don't want to deal with parents that are incapable or discourteous (even if the parents do their best,  these \"tricks\" don't always work, the family room takes time to find and isn't always sound proof, they don't actually give a hoot that their baby is being noisy, etc) then that is a reason why they may not want babies at their wedding. \n\nWeddings are expensive and if they don't to deal with them babies on that day, then no babies \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEdit to add: i also really don't care about this situation because people give options (come to wedding without baby vs don't come to wedding) and other people have a right to make choices (skip sisters wedding vs find babysitter). I don't care either way for this person's situation, but I'm just objectively presenting the possibilities that you mention you are at a loss to think of. \n\nPersonally, if it was my baby and i was not comfortable with any babysitter options, i just wouldn't go to the wedding. There were 2 options presented to me and i just chose what i preferred. If the couple were to be upset with me about my choice, then why the fuck give me just these 2 options lol", "Then why don\u2019t people use them on airplanes, the grocery store etc etc or other places babies and toddlers scream and snivel?

My mil was shocked when I said we weren\u2019t even entertaining the idea of going.", "We went to one last summer. It was fun but their names were in the invitation. If they weren\u2019t we wouldn\u2019t have gone.", "Or maybe she just doesn\u2019t want babies screaming and toddlers running around during a grownup celebration. She\u2019s not wrong for that but she needs to also realize that means some people won\u2019t be able to go. \n\nOP asked politely and sister reacted poorly. OP is NTA.", "But at the end of the day she doesn\u2019t have someone who she feels 100% comfortable leaving her child with.  If she\u2019s having to dig deep in her brain to think of someone she may have overlooked, she probably doesn\u2019t want to leave her child with that random relative she hasn\u2019t spoken to in over a year.", "Bold of you to assume they're in the picture, alive, not abusive, or live within reasonable driving distance. I'm pretty sure OP knows what realistic childcare options they have.", "It's silly because it's assuming she must not have thought of that. \n\nI mean what, she's tried to think of who could look after her baby so she can go to her sister's wedding, but didn't think about the baby's other grandparents? \n\nShe clearly can't or doesn't want to leave the baby with them.", "i think people are in general a lot more careful with their kids, and conscious of the risks (not just abuse either, but healthy attachment, baby development etc). i babysat a lot of random kids when i was a teen. honestly i didn't do that good a job but the kids were all preschool aged and above so everyone survived.\n\nas a mom now, i totally get it. putting them alone in a private space with an adult/teen i barely know when they were below the age of 4 or so was never something i was comfortable with. \n\ni don't see it as being overprotective either, babies are not developmentally really able to handle a stranger looking after them. of course they develop relationships with daycare providers and regular babysitters and extended family, but we're talking about OP just finding a random new babysitter for one evening.", "My eldest is now an adult,  but the only people I let babysit him when both xh and I were out were my own mother and a couple of trusted friends.  The in-laws were toxic to the point that we had to have a cease and desist letter sent to them from a Solicitor. Further, my eldest has a medical condition that requires at least a basic awareness of,  and depending on the time looking after him,  full-on training.  My youngest came along, and I was a single parent by then.  Even then,  I wouldn't have just trusted anyone to look after him,  particularly having witnessed and lived through the craziness of the ILs, I realised not everyone was trustworthy.
