It doesn't matter if a dog is friendly or not, leash laws exist for the purpose of keeping them from potentially attacking anyone (clearly, this woman never heard of a lawsuit). I wouldn't have called her a bitch, but I would've reported her. Did you get her name?", "Full disclosure: I'm not objective about this, because I also have an issue with unleashed dogs.\n\nThat said, NTA.\n\nYes, we're aware that dogs exist. And the law requires them to be leashed. And the fact that her dog is friendly is not her license to keep her dog unleashed.\n\nA few months ago, I had a problem with someone in our apartment with a German Shepherd. He insisted that his dog was friendly, but unfortunately, I sent the wrong message. I was crossing toward him on a narrow footbridge, and he had his dog. While it was leashed, the leash was at full extension. And he made no effort to pull the dog in, despite the fact that the bridge was only wide enough to allow two normal-sized people to pass each other.\n\nSo seeing him with a German Shepherd (that I had never seen before) coming toward me, and he was making no effort to pull the dog in, I stepped back. Which the dog took as a retreat, and immediately started barking at me.\n\nAnd on another occasion, I was taking a walk around the block to get in my ten thousand steps for the day. And I happened to see him on the sidewalk, and the dog immediately charged at me. While the dog was on a leash, he wasn't holding it, so the dog simply stood there barking at me. And I was livid. Apparently, after I complained, the management had a word with him about observing dog-owner etiquette, because although I've seen the dog since then, I've never had another problem with it.\n\nAlso, you don't know what else is out there. While I prefer dogs over cats, my efficiency apartment is too small for a dog, and I don't have a fenced in backyard. So, I own cats. So, what happens if I have to bring my cat to the vet's and put her in a carrier and I go outside to get to my car, and someone's \"friendly\" unleashed dog is in the parking lot. Am I going to get attacked so the dog can get at my cat?\n\nPersonally, I'd call the police on this woman. Dogs belong on leashes, according to the law. There's no addendum to this law that says, \"Unless your dog is 'friendly.'\"", "NTA.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t understand people saying ESH. OP only called her a bitch after she felt entitled to an explanation as to why someone wasn\u2019t talking to her, which surprise, no one owes you anything in this world, and proceeded to tell *him why *he shouldn\u2019t feel that way. Like how entitled can you be?\n\nShe\u2019s lucky all she got called was a bitch, because I wouldn\u2019t have even dignified her with any type of response, calm or otherwise.\n\n*Completely overlooked where it said he was a dude my bad lol", "NTA\n\n>because dogs exist\n\nLaws also exist and she's actually breaking one.

I don't trust other people and hope they will interact with my dogs and I don't trust other dogs.

YTA. Absolutely. And the thing is ... I totally get where you're coming from about unleashed dogs. But grownups use their words.

Not all.", "Yeah, the audacity and entitlement from some dog owners is pretty amazing.", "As a dog owner I agree! Sometimes I feel crazy, like am I the one in the wrong here?!? I KNOW I\u2019m not but I often feel in the minority as a dog owner who has never taken their dog off leash in public or let their dog run up to a strange dog.", "Her dog may not even be friendly. A lot of owners have blinders on when it comes to their dogs.", "You also can't just trust people who say that. I remember years ago I was in a corner store chatting with the proprietor when a man with two little ankle dogs (pekinese? maltipoo? I dunno) came in. I asked if they were friendly and he assured me they were, but as I bent down to pet one it snapped at me with intent, and only my reflexes saved my fingers. Then he notices I'm buying cigarettes (I quit since then) and says \"oh, they don't like smokers\".\n\nIf I wasn't friends with the shopkeep I might've smacked him.", "Right, my dog is friendly with people but not with every single other dog in existence, so we keep him leashes on walks. The audacity to assume a dog is friendly in every possible scenario in a public space is ridiculous. \n\nHere\u2019s a situation I could possibly get behind: woman unleashes her dog on the empty trail when walking with her child. Woman sees someone else on the trail, recalls her dog, leashes it while people pass, and if she\u2019s alone again, unleashes. Key factors being an airtight recall and the woman being perceptive enough to see people coming. Personally I couldn\u2019t do this with my toddler so I would leash my dog at all times, but when we\u2019ve gone on family walks (my husband attending to dog, me with toddler or vice versa) on empty trails we do unleash our dog and recall the moment we see or hear anyone.", "This is my issue. My dog LOVES humans, but not other animals, so I have to be very careful about where I take her for walks, because so many people let their dogs off leash in places that they shouldn't. My dog needs exercise and stimulation too, ffs.", "One of my relatives hardly ever put a leash on her dog. And then one day it was mauled by a leashed dog that it went up to. I think she tried to get the other dog put down but she didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on when her dog was the unleashed one.", "The number of times my apartment complex has had to put out notices for unleashed dogs is ridiculous. An unleashed dog chased me last year here. An unleashed pit bull chased kids earlier this year. Another dog was loose and I couldn\u2019t get out of my car. The owner had to chase it down. I went walking for exercise and someone\u2019s dog literally almost mowed me over. This isn\u2019t an isolated incident. Good owners never think that the vast majority of dog owners are actually shitty and entitled. People generally don\u2019t have problems with dogs, but with their owners. If owners did their part to make their dogs safer then most of these stories wouldn\u2019t exist. So it may seem like rage bait, but I can assure you that this happens more than you think.", "If you think it's just rage bait then I remember a SM influencer, with a pitbull or a dog like that, who got offended because a mom crossed the road w her little baby, and it had like 400k likes. All the awwww my sweeet lil pumpkin while demonising the mom.\n\nThere's a percentage of people who actually keep dogs lives above humans.", "But he didn't stop there. He debated leash laws and called her a bitch, presumably in front of his son.", "Friendly dogs also bite", "A lot of German Shepherds in this thread \ud83d\ude02 I have a German rescue that wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly, but we make sure to keep her on the choke collar whenever we go out.

I've had a ton of accidents/injuries from horseback riding, that I just shrugged off. Yet I legit went into (minor) shock after getting bit from breaking up a dog fight when I worked at a doggie day care. The dog I was rescuing (even though he stared it) panic bit me and a coworker who had multiple bites. I still have scars and it took two+ weeks to fully be able to use my hand properly. Those antibiotics suck! I love dogs, but even super sweet dogs can bite when they're scared.", "Sounds like my dog haha minus the part where he bit some of finger off haha but he definitely likes to do some gentle mouthing in my hands and wrists, he's super goofy lol", "Sounds like  you accidentally put your finger in the way of his teeth. You should be more cautious and take accountability.  Your Doggy's point of view: I don't know why my parent almost choked me last month, but I love them so much.\ud83d\ude04", "Exactly, harassment was the first I though, even worse than her dog being leashed.", "similar situation with one of my dogs she is very reactive to dogs she doesn't know - also a shelter baby.", "I had to pry a golden off my parents dog the other day at a dog park and tell off his owner in small words about monitoring and controlling his dog.  \u201cOh, he\u2019s just a little excited, it\u2019s all in fun, he\u2019ll calm down soon...\u201c\n\nYeah, and before he does that my parents 65 lb normally quite calm doodle may get fed up and really use his terrifying wolf throwback sized teeth.  He actually snapped at the obnoxious barnacle humper, which I\u2019ve never seen him do in eleven years.", "The previous dog I mentioned, every few months he'd pick a new dog breed and just hate that dog breed straight in the face for the next few months. It wasn't a huge deal when it was border collies or greyhounds, but there was like six months where if he saw a golden retriever it was ON SIGHT and it was so awkward. Goldens are everywhere, and he'd grumble if he saw one 20 feet away. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "The irony is that people like yourself who train their dogs well enough also know to keep their dogs leashed, and the people who don't leash their dogs are the ones foolish enough not to train them well...", "On sidewalks in my neighborhood, agree, everyone\u2019s dog is on leash usually. But not the park. There it\u2019s a majority off leash. Not dog parks just regular public parks. There are even multiple breed related meet up groups who meet there to watch their dogs run around together off leash. I used to just deal with it by picking my dog up a bunch while passing unleashed dogs (luckily small enough to do this) and trying to avoid other dogs. Last straw was having a dog owner get upset at me because I was upset he let his giant doberman run at me and my tiny dog without even trying to stop him. He said don\u2019t worry he\u2019s friendly and if I didn\u2019t like unleashed dogs I should stop coming to the park because it\u2019s the norm.\n\nMaybe it depends on where you\u2019re located. And this thread is definitely making me feel better that responsible dog owners seem to be the majority because it\u2019s not what I see around me.", "No, no they don\u2019t.", "Most are. Seattle owners are horrible.", "Yep same with my dog - reactive to unknown dogs. That's so sad that your girl was attacked :( nothing worse than witnessing a dog fight - it's so upsetting.", "Dogs are like people. Being friendly doesn\u2019t mean you like everyone.\n\nMy dog is mostly friendly. He\u2019s allowed to not want to meet other dogs or people. It\u2019s up to his comfort. I watch his body language when we meet others. He\u2019s old so if they are puppy\u2019s, he has less patience and I warn them. Owners who have leashed dogs understand and we watch our dogs and are ready to end the interaction if either dog looks like they are uncomfortable.\n\nUnleashed dogs? And their owners? Absolutely horrible.\n\nWhen I see unleashed dogs running up/charging us and the owner shouts \u201cDon\u2019t worry he/she\u2019s friendly.\u201d I always reply with \u201cI\u2019m not and I won\u2019t hesitate to hurt your dog to protect mine.\u201d And I have and I don\u2019t feel bad about it. I don\u2019t usually have to kick dogs away from mine but it has happened. \n\nUsually what happens is the owner of the unleashes dog starts yelling at me because their dog is so friendly and I don\u2019t need to act that way. The scars on my hand from a \u2018friendly\u2019 goldendoodle that went for my dog\u2019s throat say otherwise.\n\nResponsible owners keep their dogs leashed.", "Some of my neighbors are unhappy with the new-ish owners of our complex because they enforce the leash rules. I\u2019m happy about that. I mean, our apartment management has a lot of bad things about them, but that ain\u2019t one of them.", "She should be lucky that's all he did. I would have called animal control.", "[deleted]", "I'm going to say this next time", "Dogs are animals and as friendly and beautiful as they can be, they can have breaking points. What if OP's kid was the type to try and poke the dog in the mouth or something? Sure, the kid should learn not to do that, but you're allowed to not want your kid to interact with a strange dog.\n\nBut even if they're perfectly behaved and would never ever bite, somebody is still able to be afraid of an unleashed dog - people could have been bitten in the past and you can't expect every single person to be ok with your dog being free to run around and interact with whoever they want.", "Mines a rescue, too.  And super cuddly", "Right?? I had a Golden owner grab Lex by his harness and throw him because he growled and snapped at her Golden who would not leave him alone no matter how much Lex tried to leave the interaction. I wish I had been closer but it was a ball/chuck-it situation and we were both just trying to get to each other. She should have controlled her own freaking dog. But \"he's just such a sweet dog\". Grrrrr", "Yeah, no, in my area, it's usually 1 asshole who everyone hates and yells at, and calls cops on when they are off leash, cause there are like a ton of off leash dog parks that exist in my area. But most places I've lived, most dog owners keep them on even at parks", "Yes, yes they do.", "Some are. Not all.", "It's tough having a reactive dog. She's come a really long way in the time since, but she can't handle big dogs up in her space.  As long as they stay 3 feet or more away, she'll ignore them now. It's a huge improvement. I think other big dog owners don't usually expect my girl to get freaked out because she's big too.\n\nShe did so good when the other dog was trying to attack her. She was only reacting defensively until it knocked into me to get to her. Luckily, they both walked away uninjured, but it completely changed her attitude towards other big dogs. She's okay if she gets a slow, relaxed introduction over time. \n\nI just wish that other dog owners understood that dogs are as individual as people. Not all dogs are going to be friendly, and that's okay and totally valid as long as both owners are responsible. \n\nSending both you and your pup internet hugs.", "ROFL.  So you should  never  find out  if  you've  hurt someone 's feelings or made them uncomfortable  or offended  them and they're avoiding you as a result? Good luck  with  life.

She really learned her lesson. I mean, he definitely alerted the proper authorities when he called her a bitch in front of some kids, right? Now the proper authorities can enforce the law, because he called her a name. Such a great solution to the problem of her unleashed dog. It's so crazy how when you call someone a bitch, their dog suddenly is attached to a leash. Like, how does that even work? Is it magic? I dunno, but you're right that she's obviously going to leash her dog now. \n\n>I will give him extra credit if he calls the police on her.\n\nI'd give him any credit at all if he did that, but so far what he did was call a bitch. That's it. But it's good to know that next time you have a problem with a lawbreaker you're just going to call them a bitch and pretend that solved the problem. \n\n>They can explain to her that the leash laws also serve to protect her dog.\n\nWhich would be impossible unless he calls her a nasty name! Such a good point.", "Aw she sounds like a beautiful girl!!! I have another dog who is medium sized and he came from a very abusive home - took him ages to learn that all our hands in his new home are gentle hands and for love only but he's so good now and so relaxed and full of love! But he is nervous and anxious often times so he is way more scared of little dogs that bark a lot... he's not reactive he will just put his tail between his legs and then stick to me like velcro which is fine I just take him away from the small yappy dogs and we sit and relax, he has come so far since I got him, he's hands down the best dog ive ever had!
