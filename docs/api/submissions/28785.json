It doesn't matter if a dog is friendly or not, leash laws exist for the purpose of keeping them from potentially attacking anyone (clearly, this woman never heard of a lawsuit). I wouldn't have called her a bitch, but I would've reported her. Did you get her name?", "Full disclosure: I'm not objective about this, because I also have an issue with unleashed dogs.\n\nThat said, NTA.\n\nYes, we're aware that dogs exist. And the law requires them to be leashed. And the fact that her dog is friendly is not her license to keep her dog unleashed.\n\nA few months ago, I had a problem with someone in our apartment with a German Shepherd. He insisted that his dog was friendly, but unfortunately, I sent the wrong message. I was crossing toward him on a narrow footbridge, and he had his dog. While it was leashed, the leash was at full extension. And he made no effort to pull the dog in, despite the fact that the bridge was only wide enough to allow two normal-sized people to pass each other.\n\nSo seeing him with a German Shepherd (that I had never seen before) coming toward me, and he was making no effort to pull the dog in, I stepped back. Which the dog took as a retreat, and immediately started barking at me.\n\nAnd on another occasion, I was taking a walk around the block to get in my ten thousand steps for the day. And I happened to see him on the sidewalk, and the dog immediately charged at me. While the dog was on a leash, he wasn't holding it, so the dog simply stood there barking at me. And I was livid. Apparently, after I complained, the management had a word with him about observing dog-owner etiquette, because although I've seen the dog since then, I've never had another problem with it.\n\nAlso, you don't know what else is out there. While I prefer dogs over cats, my efficiency apartment is too small for a dog, and I don't have a fenced in backyard. So, I own cats. So, what happens if I have to bring my cat to the vet's and put her in a carrier and I go outside to get to my car, and someone's \"friendly\" unleashed dog is in the parking lot. Am I going to get attacked so the dog can get at my cat?\n\nPersonally, I'd call the police on this woman. Dogs belong on leashes, according to the law. There's no addendum to this law that says, \"Unless your dog is 'friendly.'\"", "NTA.\n\nAnd I don\u2019t understand people saying ESH. OP only called her a bitch after she felt entitled to an explanation as to why someone wasn\u2019t talking to her, which surprise, no one owes you anything in this world, and proceeded to tell *him why *he shouldn\u2019t feel that way. Like how entitled can you be?\n\nShe\u2019s lucky all she got called was a bitch, because I wouldn\u2019t have even dignified her with any type of response, calm or otherwise.\n\n*Completely overlooked where it said he was a dude my bad lol", "NTA\n\n>because dogs exist\n\nLaws also exist and she's actually breaking one.

I don't trust other people and hope they will interact with my dogs and I don't trust other dogs.

YTA. Absolutely. And the thing is ... I totally get where you're coming from about unleashed dogs. But grownups use their words.

Not interrogate him about why he doesn't want to talk to me.\n\nNot only would it not be worth it considering she didn't even know OP existed last week, and it's none of her business why he doesn't talk to her, but she's also laying out the red carpet to be insulted. She's literally *asking* to be insulted.\n\nWhat kind of answer does she expect, considering that she's fully aware that he's hostile to her?\n\nAnd instead of accepting the fact that he doesn't like her, and just not talking to him anymore, she decides that this is just so almighty important that she must know why. Like I said, she's just inviting him to insult her.\n\nAnd he simply states that he doesn't like the fact that she refuses to leash her dog. And I don't blame him. It's arrogant behavior. \"Oh, I know there's a leash law, but I'm **special**! I don't have to obey leash laws that serve to protect others and my dog!\"\n\nSo, she then gets defensive and gets into a debate. All of which could have been avoided if she had minded her own business.\n\nSo she calls him immature, \"Grow up!\" and an asshole! Then makes some smug condescending remark that dogs exist. We all know that dogs exist. The fact that we have leash laws shows that we already know that dogs exist. We couldn't make leash laws if we didn't know that dogs exist.\n\nSo, we've established her busybodyness, and the fact that she's rude. She insults him twice. But the minute he calls her a bitch in retaliation, you decide that he's the asshole, too???\n\nSeriously???\n\nI'm genuinely curious, but just how much boorish behavior is a woman allowed to get away with before a man is allowed to call her a bitch without being considered an asshole by you?", "Because\u2026he doesn\u2019t want to be around her unleashed dog?", ">But then you called her a bitch.\n\nAfter she told him to grow up, called him an asshole and made some smug remark about how dogs exist.\n\nTo say nothing of the fact that she insisted on engrossing him in conversation after he's made it clear that he has no interest in talking to her.\n\nNo, calling her a bitch after all that does not make him an asshole.

Especially because she's tethered to me on leash and still recovering from a serious leg injury. She feels extra vulnerable. She's not aggressive, and has never tried to nip or bite. I'd like to keep it that way! I enforce her physical boundaries so she doesn't have to.

We call impolite people AH.", "Of course not but you don't decide to engage in a conversation with a person, tell them a very valid concern that you have regarding their dog and then add that you don't want to talk to them.

It's pretty straightforward.\n\nedit to add: Also, like, she still \"got away with it\" she just got called a bitch. But it's not like OP did anything to actually stop her from taking her dog off leash or whatever.

The other is a pointed insult.\n\nAnd frankly, the OP is not nearly as rude, or at least as clueless, as this woman is. If I'm out walking and I happen to someone I'd never seen before, then start to see him every day, I might say hello in passing. But if he is abrupt, and makes it clear that he has no interest in talking to me. I would simply let it go.  Not decide to stop and interrogate this person as to why he doesn't want to talk to me.\n\nIt's none of my business and why should I care? I didn't even know this person existed last week.\n\nAnd we know she's not clueless, since she picked up on the fact that he's cold toward her. So, rudeness is the only other option. She's not owed an explanation, and it's just an invitation to say something insulting.\n\nAnd let's not forget the clear message she's sending by not leashing her dog. The message is loud and clear: \"I'm arrogant and entitled! I know there's a leash law, but I'm **special**! I don't have to obey that law!\"", "Since you're missing the obvious point, I'll spell it out.\n\nShe called him names first, to say nothing of the fact she stopped and interrogated someone who is obviously cold toward her.\n\nYet, you describe calling her a bitch as \"completely uncalled for.\"\n\nSo she calls him an asshole and tells him to grow up. How could insulting her in response be \"completely uncalled for\"? Do you even know what \"uncalled for\" means?\n\nIt means unwarranted and undeserved. And since she started calling names first, it was not unwarranted or undeserved.\n\n>really solved your own problems by calling her a bitch didn't ya.\n\nWhy, yes, he did! He did solve his own problems. He wants nothing to do with her and would prefer she not talk to him at all, and his actions ensured that she never will.

An unleashed dog is equivalent to carrying a giant illuminated sign, \"I'm arrogant and entitled, and laws don't apply to me!\"\n\nAnd calling her a bitch has ensured that she will ignore him in passing from now on.\n\nSo, since he wants nothing to do with her, he did solve his problem by calling her a bitch.\n\nAnd I will give him extra credit if he calls the police on her. They can explain to her that the leash laws also serve to protect her dog.
