Let's call her Maisie.\n\nHis workplace hosted a late new years kind of party last Friday, where employees were allowed to bring their partners too. I met Maisie at the party. She looked lovely, but definitely like a girl who works in a male dominated field and she really wasn't my boyfriend's type.\n\nWhen she introduced herself, I said something like \"Oooh, so *you* are Maisie, huh...\" With the \"huh\" sounding a bit like a sigh of relief. It wasn't on purpose, it just slipped out. She looked at me confused and I realised that I fucked up. \n\nShe asked me what I meant and I'm not good at improvising so I just pointed to the random guy standing next to her and said \"Haha, I just see you came with your boyfriend. Nate talked about you so much in the past few months that I started to worry.. but I see you have a boyfriend, so huh...\" and did that relief motion with my hand.\n\nMaisie looked at the guy, who was now turning his back at us and really really not at all looking like he was her boyfriend. Then she looked back at me, told me he was not her boyfriend, and that Nate told her a lot about me too and I wasn't like she expected either. Then she made an excuse and walked away.\n\nNate is angry at me and even though a few days have passed, he still keeps saying that he is disappointed in me. I think he is blowing it out of proportions and yeah, what I did was wrong, but I wasn't *that* much of an asshole, was I? And what am I supposed to do? Get Maisie number somehow and apologise to her or what? AITA?\n\n\n\n\nEdit for those calling me insecure:\n\nFor the last several months, I've been listening to my boyfriend talk so highly of her. \"Our team is really lucky we got Maisie, she is such an asset, she has so much potential, she is so good at handling the junior colleagues, she made brownies for everyone, and so on.\" They go to a bar once a month with their team and 2 weeks ago, Nate came home drunken and told me he has such a good talk with Maisie, they talked about the meaning of life (yes, seriously...) and she asked some very good questions and made good points so now he needs to rethinking the whole thing.\n\nTell me none of you would get even just a tiny little insecure voice in your head if you heard this. No, I don't think Nate would ever cheat on me, but he could still leave me for another woman.", "created_utc": 1675122327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pi12j/aita_for_accidentally_implying_to_my_boyfriends/", "score": 122, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But keep it up, and he just might find someone else who isn\u2019t threatened by his superstar coworker.\n\nYTA", "I am sure this is going to get lost as this post is hours old already but, YTA.  I am a woman who worked the majority of my adult life in a male dominated field.  I spoke highly of my (MANY) male colleagues, as I\u2019m sure (I know) they did of me.  I left my husband when he couldn\u2019t stop worrying about my male coworkers, and saw many coworkers leave their wives for the same reasons.  \n\nYour insecurities are YOUR problem and if you can\u2019t control them you need to find another boyfriend.  There is NO WAY your boyfriend is going to be able to cater to them and acting like that is going to put a strain on both his career and your relationship.  They are professionals. Get over yourself.", "YTA also your bf may not be as shallow as you are.", "YTA, people of the opposite sex can be friends without any kind of intentions you know.", "NTA. People on Reddit like to act like they\u2019re all perfect and don\u2019t say the wrong things sometimes. I honestly don\u2019t think this is a big deal at all.", "NAH. You're not the asshole for having an involuntary gut reaction.\n\nAs an aside, this situation (and the comments here) are why a lot of workplaces are ditching their workplace parties. People today are too easily offended.", "NTA - if you had actually said what you said in the post, it\u2019d be different\n\nBut just a \u201chuh\u201d is not that big of a deal.\n\nI could just be reading way too into this based on your edit, but it kind of sounds like she just felt awkward because you implied you thought your boyfriend has a crush on her.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why he\u2019s embarrassed too.\n\nYou didn\u2019t say anything mean, so NTA.\n\nBut yeah\u2026.your boyfriend kind of *does* sound like he has a crush on her lol.", "People here will hate me but NAH. The girl is obviously not one, your bf is rightfully upset because this caused an awkward situation with a coworker and you aren\u2019t because it was an accident.\n\nAs a woman who works in IT I am amused by you thinking we aren\u2019t pretty (but not offended :) )", "Going by just the text as given, NAH. *Both you and your boyfriend* can be thoughtless / insensitive at times? Sure.\n\nAnd honestly, worrying a bit about one\u2019s partner giving ongoing glowing praise of a potentially eligible person of their preferred gender\u2026 seems all too human.\n\nYou fucked up. We all do.", "I 100% understand your feelings. Especially with the edit. You made a mistake with your comment to her for sure. But it sounds like your bf thinks very highly of her and I can absolutely see how this could bring out some insecure feelings. Also, Maisie was pretty rude. I'd be really open about your feelings with your bf.", "She didn't call Maisie ugly to her face. Are you condemning her for merely THINKING the woman is ugly?", "I cackled when I read that line.\n\nI\u2019m a woman who works in one of the most male dominated industries possible (firearms). I\u2019m just as likely to be tearing shit up in the machine shop as I am to look cute and ~girly af. Almost like each woman is an individual and can have varied interests/hobbies, regardless of where they work or what career they have, *GASP*", "Yeah, I would like to know what I'm supposed to look like also.", "Right?! OP is an asshole for how they treated Maisie at the party and still an asshole for the way they think and speak about her now.\n\nBeing insecure and jealous is no excuse for being ugly.", "I know a couple who are stunning. More importantly, they\u2019re super smart. If I was OP, I would be worried because it sounds like her bf is really enjoying a smart woman he can have meaningful conversations with. That makes her beautiful. YTA OP", "My guess is it\u2019s her way of saying she looked like a lesbian. Total YTA", "Reminds me of the scene in An Education (that Carey Mulligan film) where Rosamund Pike's character is all \"Why do all the girls who go to university look so frumpy? They've all got glasses and bad skin and frumpy clothes, they can't all have started out that way, it must be something about university that makes them look like that\" (to paraphrase)\n\nSooo... yeah. \n\nOP, you're not YTA for feeling insecure. That happens to everyone sometimes! You're right, it is completely understandable that if your partner starts gushing about some new person that it might even momentarily, make you feel some type of way. And you're only a little bit YTA for what you said to Maisie -- we've all put our foot in our mouth and said something so awkward that we wanted to just rewind time and make it go away. Shit happens. \n\nMostly YTA for not immediately being like \"I can't believe I said that, that was so weird of me, please forget it ever happened\" or whatever.", "They\u2019re supposed to look like Large Marge, of course /s", "She\u2019s a gross AH for that line alone", "Right I\u2019m trying to figure out what that even means. And she wants to act like she doesn\u2019t mean to offended her but definitely did and what sold it was when she did the relief motion like I just lifted so much a weight off my shoulder and what I just said basically doesn\u2019t matter.  When all she had to do was talk to her boyfriend and ask why he was talking about his coworker so much or tell him she felt insecure hearing so much about her.", "She has nothing to worry about. He will dump her soon. Clever never lasts long with dumb...", "You took the words out of my mouth. I also work in a male dominated field. I am the only woman in the office to boot. I made it my mission to be extra nice to all the wives of my coworkers because of girls like OP.", "Amen!! I'm right there with you!!", "Yeah, her BF probably told his coworker how sweet and nice his GF was. Proved him wrong...", "\"If you have good thoughts it will shine out of your face like sunbeams and you will always look lovely.\" - Roald Dahl.", "Exactly this. \n\nMy dance teacher always told me \"a pretty face will never cover for an ugly soul\" and OP's soul is definitely...woof.", "She ain\u2019t pretty, she just looks that way", "I certainly know which one came off as petty.", "Also just because OP thinks she isn't pretty doesn't mean others think she isn't.", "Yup. I mean Jayz cheated on Beyonce so it is possible for men to downgrade.", "Maisie already has him questioning the meaning of life lol", "Oh, and YTA.", "I have a filter so I don\u2019t even think that way towards virtual strangers", "You would if she had said it to you lol", "Well duh, of course people make mistakes. The important part about making mistakes is what you have done after the mistake.\n\nOP cares more about how she hurt her own feelings than she does the people whose feelings *she* hurt. She hurt not only the coworker but also her boyfriend. Her reaction? \"I know I did something wrong but I don't see any reason to do anything about it because I'm too busy being hurt\"", "Agreed i don't think I was that bad but reddit is going to turn this into a mountain.", "She made it clear that's what she was thinking.", "She didn't have to, her face/tone/attitude said it all...", "...I mean, going \"WHOA DOG THAT'S AN UGLY CHICK\" in your head is not... great...", "She\u2019s also calling her ugly to a bunch of strangers", "Same", "Idk but probably tired of the sexist bullshit if that\u2019s a look?", "Same. Sounds like OP is jealous she's not smart and/or motivated and/or tough enough to work in a male dominated field. OP, YTA.", "Met too. Nobody would ever guess that I work in the industry I work in just by looking at me.", "What is a lesbian supposed to look like? Are they all... identical?", "That's the worst part too. In her edit she's all \"he talked about her to me all the time\", when he was probably also talking about OP to her all the time and how much he liked her. And then boom. Ruined it.", "I love dance teacher sayings! Mine always said \u201cSmarty had a party and nobody came\u201d\u2026.
