He wakes me up when I snore and I told him not to do that. He even admitted to me, that because the amount of times I turn around and continue sleeping is much bigger than the amount of times I wake up and snap, he just does it. I have had countless talks about this with him. He says he won't do it. Every time. He does it again. Every time. \n\nI do not want to sleep separately all the time just because of it, but he is welcome to go sleep on the couch if he wakes up because of my snoring (probably AH-ish on my part). \n\nI hate being woken up because I can hardly ever go back to sleep. Even when my baby was a few months old, I most couldn't go back to sleep once woken up. So I hate it and I snap real hard. I started making his night miserable, as well, because, you know, if I stay up because of you, then I might drag you with me. I am very pissed at this moment.\n\nRecently he promised to not wake me up again (LOL) and I ak very sure he will. So Reddit, am I the asshole for snapping at my husband for waking me up because of my snoring?\n\nUPDATE: I did not know sleep studies existed and I will definately be looking into that  when I go to the doctor and see if I can fix this.

Your snoring is impacting his ability to sleep. The onus is on you to fix this situation, not for him to just suffer through it. What about his sleep? \n\nHave you gone to a doctor, do you sleep with nose strips, like what are you doing to handle this situation? This seems really unfair on your husband.", "YTA, you know you snore, you know it bothers your partner, you know that your behavior when you are woken can be vindictive and inappropriate. You need to manage this so your partner can also have restful sleep (in bed, YTA especially for making him sleep on the couch when YOU snore) and not live in fear of your reactions when you are woken. \n\nHave you done a sleep study to learn more about why you are consistently snoring?", "YTA. So you should be able to sleep nice and peacefully but he\u2019s had to suffer for years with getting woken up by youre snoring and gets yelled at when he tries to get you to stop. Start sleeping at an angle or something.", "You are definitely TAH. Aside from the fact that it's generally the snorer's responsibility to try not to disturb someone else's sleep by trying any of the things that can help with snoring (strips, doctor, etc.), I can't get over how petulant and childish it is for you to purposely \"make his night miserable\" in retaliation. Yikes.", "YTA. Get a sleep study or sleep separately. Why is your sleep more important than his?", "So you waking him up by snoring is ok though? I think YTA", "YTA...why don't you go sleep on the couch? Why should he, when you're the one with the disruptive problem?", "YTA for snapping at him. You\u2019re an adult and behavior like this is unacceptable in a healthy relationship, especially since you seem uncompromising in finding a solution. You just want your husband to get over it. \n\nI feel for both of you though because my husband snores and he\u2019s called me mean for waking him up to roll over. I also have a hard time going back to sleep if woken up like you and I can feel extremely frustrated. We use a noise machine and sometimes I take unisom. We also have a spare room in case one of us can\u2019t seem to get through the night. We wind down and go to bed early on a regular basis. \n\nYou need to see a doctor about your snoring if it\u2019s affecting your marriage. There are even surgeries you can get where excess flesh is removed from your nose to help your breathing. Changing your pillow or mattress posture can also help. In the end, you really need to be more proactive and cooperative for both of you.", "So you are asking if you are the AH because you can disrupt his sleep, but you don't want him disrupting yours and you snap at him if he does?  I would say YTA.  I say this as someone that snores - this is your problem to fix, not his, so why does he exclusively have to go sleep on the couch?", "YTA.  \n\n>I started making his night miserable, as well, because, you know, if I stay up because of you, then I might drag you with me. I am very pissed at this moment.\n\nIf he is waking you up because you are snoring then you are missing the fact that *you woke him up first with your snoring.*  So, to turn your argument on its head he has every right to wake you up because he can't sleep with you snoring.\n\nYou need to talk to your doctor about you snoring.  You could have sleep apnea or some other underlying condition that could be treated (maybe your adenoids need to come out).  Also apologize to your husband for waking him up because you snore.", "YTA.\n\nSo it's an issue and you snap when he wakes you up because you snore but it's 100% ok to wake him up because...you...snore?\n\nHow is that fair OP? You know you snore but your husband has to be punished more?", "YTA.  Get you ass to a doctor.  Your right to a night\u2019s sleep does not supersede his right to a night\u2019s sleep.", "YTA just from the self righteous tone of your post.\n\n1) Get a sleep study.  If you do have sleep apnea, not only is it VERY bad for your overall health, but can be treated.\n\n2) Sleep in separate rooms.  You say you don\u2019t want o do this, but a) don\u2019t say why and b) would be happy for him to sleep on the couch.  So if you are okay with him sleeping somewhere else, just make it a thing where both of you have real beds.\n\n3) You the AH just from the comment that if you can\u2019t get back to sleep then neither should he.\n\nFix YOUR problem and you both can sleep.

You don't get to throw this on him.\n\nWhen he wakes you up because YOU are keeping HIM from sleeping, YOU need to get up and move to the couch instead of acting like a 5 year old.. Why does he have to choose between listening to your noise in a comfy bed or sleeping on the uncomfortable couch? You are the one creating the issue. You go be uncomfortable and let him sleep. \n\nGo buy nose strips or go to the doctor or you go sleep in another room.", "YTA. Wow! You are selfish! For a few years, the poor guy has put up with losing sleep to your snoring. He's also put up with your lousy attitude about it as well. You don't bother seeking treatment because your snoring affects him and not you. You tell him that he can sleep on the couch even though YOU are the one with the disorder.  Then you decide to be vindictive too.  What exactly do you bring to the table to offer him? Because at this point, you are sorely lacking in so many things.", "YTA.\n\nIf this is at the point where he's losing a lot of sleep, I can understand him waking you up. There's only so much disrupted sleep someone can take. You're snapping at him waking you up so you know that, but he's experiencing that disrupted sleep regularly too.\n\nWhat steps are you taking to combat this? Have you been to see a doctor about snoring? Have you considered that maybe his need for undisrupted sleep (just like you need undisrupted sleep) makes it worth sleeping separately? You say \"just because of it\"...but, regularly being woken up by someone snoring is a huge thing.\n\n\"I hate being woken up because I can hardly ever go back to sleep.\" Have you considered that your partner might hate being woken up too? You say you start making his night miserable if he wakes you up...because you might as well drag him with you, but your snoring is waking him up. What's your plan for dealing with things when he starts retaliating like this whenever your snoring wakes him up? \n\nTaking steps like getting professional medical advice could be really important if sleeping in separate beds isn't an option for you.", "Yta, get a CPAP machine or sleep in separate bedrooms", "Yta you snore. You need to address this. With breathing strips, a c pap, seperate bedrooms,, SOMETHING. Demanding your partner be sleep deprived bc 'I don't want to sleep apart' is bs.", "YTA because you are refusing to do anything to make it easier for him, yet you have the audacity to be mad when *your* precious sleep is disturbed? Oh, please.\n\nYou know how frustrated you get when he wakes you up? Now think about how he must feel constantly having to deal with you sawing logs and not being able to sleep with the noise.\n\nYou should sleep on the couch or see a sleep specialist. If you don\u2019t then he has every right to wake you up to make the noise stop.  The fact that you would dare suggest that he has to be the one to go to sleep on the couch is incredibly inconsiderate and self-centered.", "YTA and a miserable one. Your husband is already having a rotten sleep, but you think you are the one that\u2019s hard done by for occasionally being woken up?\n\nSnoring is often the sign of a medical issue. See a doctor, or get a place with two bedrooms so you can both sleep in peace.", "YTA. He needs sleep, too. See a doctor. In the meantime, get a wedge pillow so you can sleep with your upper body elevated. It will reduce some snoring.", "YTA. YOU'RE the one being disruptive so if anyone should be \"welcome to go sleep on the couch\" it should be you.", "YTA. You need to make an effort to fix your snoring issue, and if no efforts work then you need to sleep separate. It\u2019s as simple as that.", "Go get a sleep study.", "YTA, do you think he enjoys being woken up by your snoring? It seems you have made no effort to try to make anything better on your end about your snoring. Why should he have to suffer forever while you saw logs? Listening to someone snore is awful. I agree it sucks to be woken up, but that is what is happening to him! And you making his night miserable if he wakes you up is so childish and petty. You both need to figure out a solution that works for both of you.", "YTA.  Your choices are sleep separately, keep h up all night with your snoring or be awakened when you do. Assume 2 won't happen.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow it does go both ways and if he snores waking him up is appropriate.", "YTA. You are waking him up all the time with your snoring and you haven\u2019t tried anything to fix it yet? This sounds like a you-problem and not a him-problem", "YTA - as much as I was the AH for my snoring and not doing anything about it for years (my 20's). Time for a sleep study and maybe a CPAP. Life changing and EVERYONE sleeps better because of it.", "My partner snores like a freight train. I use earplugs, but doesn\u2019t always do the trick. I\u2019ll gently tap him or push him to roll over and he usually stays asleep and it stops. I\u2019m thinking this is what OP\u2019s husband does. Which means he wakes up twice as often as she does.  YTA for this psychological warfare you\u2019re pulling making him miserable. Trust me, he\u2019s miserable enough.", "I mean\u2026yeah, YTA.  If it\u2019s bad enough that he can\u2019t sleep, what exactly is he supposed to do?  He should not have to go to the couch every time.  And most of the time it *doesn\u2019t* wake you up so much that you can\u2019t go back to sleep\u2026so I\u2019m not surprised he continues doing it.  Only occasionally does it mean you both won\u2019t keep sleeping (when he wakes you, then you keep him up thereafter).\n\nIs it the *way* he wakes you up?  He should avoid poking you, but he could gently rub your arm as a \u201csignal\u201d until you stop snoring.  \n\nAnd you should definitely ask your doctor for advice on what you can do to help with the snoring (new pillow, etc).", "Man, you're selfish.\n\nYes, YTA. Heavy snoring is another of those issues that has probably existed for as long as humanity has existed. It's not your fault, but its your responsibility to manage your health.\n\nTalk to a doctor. Snoring heavily and constantly throughout the night is often a sign of something that can be treated. I have sleep apnea and now use a CPAP machine, for example.\n\nBut if you continue to ignore the issue and berate your husband it's eventually going to explode. Nobody wants to spend their entire adult life \\*not\\* getting a good nights sleep because their partner snores so much, and then being told they're an asshole when they try to address it. Have you considered that your husband is trying to cause you some discomfort in order to incentivize you to solve the problem? You say it's been years that this has been an issue so to me that sounds like he's tried to address it the \"mature\" way, and you just aren't doing anything about it so at this point, what else is he supposed to do?", "Oh you\u2019re a giant fucking asshole. So it\u2019s ok for his sleep to constantly be broken by your snoring but god forbid you have to wake up in return? Give me a break. YTA and a selfish partner.", "So many people have said it already, but YTA, obviously. The entitlement you're showing here is unbelievable. You're the one snoring. You're the one creating the problem here, doing absolutely nothing to try to fix it, and worst of all having the absolute audacity to lash out at your husband for being affected by it.\n\nAlso, I couldn't help but notice that, from the context of the story, your husband is actually losing out on more sleep than you are. But you don't seem to be very concerned about his health and well-being (although perfectly willing to kick him out of his own bed, it seems.) Ask yourself how you would feel if the situation were reversed. If it was his snoring waking you up. Would you feel justified in waking him up in that instance?", "YTA because you are the one waking him up with your snoring.  Either see a doctor to get help  with YOUR problem or YOU should sleep on the couch.", "YTA. Your sleep isn't more important than his, and he doesn't deserve to sleep on the couch because you snore and won't agree to separate beds. You're being incredibly selfish.\n\nOn a not-so-side note, consider getting checked for sleep apnea. Snoring can be caused by your airways collapsing during sleep, which can result in your not breathing for several seconds. This is treatable, can vastly improve your sleep quality, and can allow you and your husband to continue sharing a bed.", "YTA. Have to taken a moment to consider the impact your snoring has on his sleep? or are you too busy thinking about yourself?\n\nIt's time to go to the doctor and have a sleep study done to find out what options are available to you to stop your snoring. Honestly it was time a few years ago when this issue started.", "100% YTA, both me and my partner snore, but while I can sleep through him, sometimes my snoring is really bad that it wakes him, so he wakes me. I apologise, turn on my side and we both go back to sleep. Sometimes I wake him a second time, so he wakes me up and I go sleep on the couch. Yes I can't help it, yes I've tried all different things to stop, but when it's so bad he has to wake me up twice I feel so bad I leave him in the bedroom and take myself out of the equation. This is kind of the adult thing to do though, it appears you don't want to look at adult ways of dealing with it", "YTA it\u2019s super childish to make someone you supposedly love miserable twice over(snoring so loud and making him miserable if you wake up) you try things to stop snoring (other people have covered this) and he tries things to not hear you(noise canceling headphones or ear plugs). It\u2019s almost like if you BOTH tried to resolve the issue and worked together like your supposed to in a marriage y\u2019all would be able to actually sleep.", "YTA. Sleep disruption and deprivation is so much bigger of an issue than people make it out to be. \n\nI had no idea how huge of an impact sleep makes on your life until I got into a regular sleep pattern. This included my husband and I sleeping in separate rooms because it made no sense for us to continue suffering. We made that decision at 6 months into our relationship. We\u2019ve been together ten years. \n\nSleeping apart doesn\u2019t kill love, but I\u2019ll tell you what will-declining mental health, aggression, anxiety, weight gain, personality changes, etc. which are all things that can be exacerbated or brought on by sleep issues. I have severe OCD (diagnosed, compulsions, etc. just to clarify that I\u2019m not using the term flippantly) which is obviously not curable in the traditional sense, but my mental health and resilience improved immensely once I began to sleep regularly. I\u2019m not saying sleep fixed me, but I believe it played a role in my improved quality of life. \n\nThis is a physical and mental health problem that will turn into a crisis or a divorce if you don\u2019t either a) see a doctor or b) get separate sleep areas. Please take this seriously. You cannot continue to disrupt his sleep.", "Yeah, YTA. You\u2019re the one with the snoring problem, it\u2019s *your* responsibility to mitigate it. Get a sleep study. Get some breathe right strips. Sleep in another room. Deal with getting woken up. But it\u2019s absurd you think it\u2019s fine to wake your husband up with your snoring, but not for him to poke you or ask you to roll over or whatever he does to try to make it stop.", "YTA, how could you not be? You *already are* disrupting his sleep and making his nights miserable! The snorer is the one who has to solve the problem, not the person who can\u2019t sleep because their AH partner doesn\u2019t do anything about their snoring. The snorer is the one who needs to sleep on the couch if they can\u2019t be bothered to solve the issue. \n\nMassive AH, can\u2019t believe your husband has accepted this treatment for so long.", "Go and see a doctor and get a sleep study done. This is in your power to try and remediate. Perhaps try that rather than coming on Reddit, might just be more effective???

I need lots of white noise (fans, rain noise, sleep machine etc etc)  I need to pitch black dark and super cold.  And I understand that this will likely require me to sleep in a guest room should i find myself in a relationship.  And I am cool with that.  It's just sleep.

Snoring is a breathing problem. And your husband has to sleep too. You can't just say that it's not fair for him to wake you up and then you not allow him to get sleep.

Because there are a lot of products out there that can help. If they don't work, go to a sleep doctor.", "YTA. My partner snores real bad sometimes, the one time I slept somewhere else so I didn't have to wake them up they ended up basically begging me to wake them up rather than force me to sleep somewhere else. They also talked about finding solutions such as nasal strips or other things to help rather than blame me for their snoring. If you struggle to get back to sleep as well try sleep aids too? There are options, don't just make your issue someone else's.", "YTA, but it is just a shit situation. I understand you can\u2019t control what happens when you sleep. \n\nCompromise, friend.

He wakes me up when I snore and I told him not to do that. He even admitted to me, that because the amount of times I turn around and continue sleeping is much bigger than the amount of times I wake up and snap, he just does it. I have had countless talks about this with him. He says he won't do it. Every time. He does it again. Every time. \n\nI do not want to sleep separately all the time just because of it, but he is welcome to go sleep on the couch if he wakes up because of my snoring (probably AH-ish on my part). \n\nI hate being woken up because I can hardly ever go back to sleep. Even when my baby was a few months old, I most couldn't go back to sleep once woken up. So I hate it and I snap real hard.

We both snore, but I have had heavily disturbed sleep for years (insomnia, hypnagogic hallucinations, etc) so it used to take me a long time to fall asleep. He drops out like a light, and immediately starts snoring. So I could literally never sleep, and it led to  my life sucking because of it. Constantly running on disturbed sleep that you don't get even get enough of because your partner is keeping you awake quickly leads to significant issues.\n\nTwo years ago, I finally got sent in for a sleep study, which my doctor's been pushing for for years. Turns out I have sleep apnea. Which is bad. Like, really bad. It dramatically increases your risks for a massive number of illnesses. Heart failure, stroke, all sorts of stuff.  I was idly chatting with the person who was hooking me up to all the machines for the study, and the reason she went into sleep pulmonology is because she has heart failure directly caused by her own sleep apnea. We also suspect that my grandfather who passed away just a year ago from stroke, who was diagnosed with sleep apnea years and years ago but never used his machine... it's likely that's WHY he had the stroke. That's a hell of a wake up call.\n\nShe also mentioned that basically most people who snore, likely have sleep apnea.\n\nNow that I'm using a A-pap machine, my life at least has changed. No more headaches, dry throat, hallucinations. I don't wake myself up snoring. I actually feel rested after sleeping, instead of lousy. The hypersomnia i was experiencing during the day has significantly lessened. The machine stops my snoring. And even better my husband just took a sleep study of his own after me pestering him for it. He also has apnea (which we already knew, it was really obvious he was stopping breathing), but now he should be getting a machine in a few weeks. We're hoping we'll be able to sleep together again.\n\nBut to your question, yes, YTA. Whether you're doing it on purpose or not, you are directly causing an issue for BOTH of you. He needs good sleep just as much as you do, and I can guarantee your snoring and keeping him awake is making him feel like utter shit during the day. If your snoring is bad enough to keep someone awake, you're also likely experiencing sleep apnea, which is a very serious illness. You need to go in for a sleep study. I'm honestly really surprised you haven't been looking into all the horrors that can result from lack of sleep, on his behalf. I bet he has.\n\nIn the mean time- is it possible for you both to sleep separately? There's this really weird stigma about couples NEEDING to sleep together. And yeah, it's nice to be able to sleep in the same room. But it's a hell of a lot nicer to both be able to SLEEP. If sleeping in different rooms lets you both be fully rested, and you have the ability to do that, then that's what you need to do. \n\nYour literal lives depend on good sleep.

You've been extremely selfish and hypocritical.  Even worse is that in all this time you've done -nothing- to correct the problem so that he can sleep, too.\n\nYou owe him a massive apology for how you've treated him and need to get this fixed or let him sleep separate from you in comfort, not just kicking him to the couch because you know the discomfort will make him come back eventually.", "YTA.
