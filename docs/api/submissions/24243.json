I don't want to make a generalization, but those comments tell me that people probably don't have experience with medical neglect/discrimination from staff on the basis of being \"unliked\", \"annoying\", or \"too responsive\". I have, and it is the worst thing to experience someone dismiss your very real pain because they think you are acting \"off\" or \"annoying\".\n\nSure, the nurse could have been blowing off steam with the comment.

At worse, it's another case of \"well, I don't like them because they're weird/off-putting/annoying and I'll let that judgement cloud my medical care.\" It's good that she apologized, but OP's responses both times were not too extreme and I think they handled it incredibly well.

She was letting off steam, and you can really tell she was disappointed in herself.", "NAH.\n\nAs a client, or a visitor of a client, you have the right to be upset over what you overheard. I've actually had a similar situation where I overheard a doctor smack-talk my father when she was in a different room. I live in the United States, so the fact it's going to cost an arm and a leg (even with health insurance) just to be sitting in this room for 30 minutes, it very pissed me off to hear the smack talk coming from someone I expect professionalism from.\n\nHowever, I think in this situation, the nurse had a \"heat of the moment\" situation that just came out.

And like you said, I\u2019m not there trying to score pain meds, I have those at home, but they are currently not working, either because the pain is too intense or I immediately throw them up. Same with my nausea meds (even one that I take that\u2019s sub-lingual). I\u2019m there because I need relief.\n\nI\u2019ve had this for 11 years now, during which I\u2019ve had over half a dozen surgeries (each needing a minimum 3 day stay), dozens of acute flares requiring hospitalization for 2-5 days, and double that in ER visits where they were able to get things under control in less than 24 hours. So by this point, I\u2019m very well-versed in what\u2019s going to happen with me, how the ER/hospital works, etc. It wasn\u2019t immediate, but eventually I got to the point where even as bad as I feel, I crack dumb jokes, make small talk with the nurses, or explain my condition to them in greater detail (it\u2019s not super common, especially for my age & gender). It is a coping mechanism for me and helps take my mind off the fact that it feels like I\u2019m being repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen. I do try to let the nurses know that though, so they don\u2019t think I\u2019m completely insane, lol.\n\nI also try to be as patient and understanding as possible with the nurses, especially in the ER. I know how crazy and stressful it can be, not to mention how rude and awful other patients can be. It may take awhile for the doctor to put in orders for meds and it may be a bit before they\u2019re able to bring them to you due to caseload. So it\u2019s usually not their fault. Plus, it\u2019s not wise to be a dick to the person standing in between you and the relief you so desperately need. If you aren\u2019t actively dying, they can very well take their time and I wouldn\u2019t blame them one bit.", "You're right, I don't get to decide what hurts someone.
