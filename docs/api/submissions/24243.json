It was the first time it had beeped so it freaked him out, especially since he's had it less than a year.\n\nMy dad's way of handling his many trips to the hospital is to joke around with staff and downplay the seriousness of the situation.

We were all trying to keep things lighthearted.\n\nThe ER has a machine that will run a diagnostic on the Pacemaker. To use it the nurse needed the model.

I also know some patients can really be difficult to handle and remembered how my coworkers and I used to get frustrated.

She has a stressful job and let off a little steam where she didn\u2019t think anyone involved would hear. You were in a stressful situation and defended the people you love. She made a sincere apology, and will probably be more considerate in the future. You accepted her apology as best as you could under the circumstances.\n \n\nCould she have been more professional? Yes. Could you have been a little more gracious about the apology? Possibly. But under the circumstances, you were both human and doing your best in an imperfect world. You both sound like pretty good people.", "NAH, she didn\u2019t mean for you to hear that, and yes nurses have very stressful jobs with very little rest. But you did hear it and it\u2019s ok to stand up for yourself and your family. \nI\u2019d say don\u2019t feel bad for standing up for your self. But also try not to hold it against the nurse.", "NTA.\n\nShe slipped and lost focus of her professional conduct. You did the right thing - from what you describe, in a very sober way.\n\nRest easy. You didnt permanently scar anyone. Perhaps you did that nurse a favor. Perhaps she realized she was getting out of sync with her core values.\n\nLet it go buddy.", "NTA there is letting off steam, which is preferably done in private, and there is talking crap to coworkers.  The nurse engaged in the latter, on hospital grounds, where patients could hear, during the performance of her duties.  That is not okay, and you were perfectly justified in calling her out.", "NTA. I mean, it sucks she cried and all, but she shouldn\u2019t be bad mouthing patients and their families because she had a bad day.", "NTA. My mom was on the brink of death and the ER nurses had the audacity to joke and laugh amongst themselves as they were hooking her up to things and taking vitals and I lost it on them. I\u2019m sitting here with my heart dropping the last thing I want to hear is you just having such a good time when I had to beg for someone to come to the room after waiting for over 20 minutes thinking she would die before anyone came to the room. And sure enough her BP was so low she almost did in fact DIE. I get getting desensitized but have some common sense.", "NTA. That you are trying to think of better tactics is commendable, though.", "NTA im sure she didnt mean it in that way but we cant all act like we dont complain about certain things or take it out on other people", "NTA.  Nurses adhere to a strict do no harm promise. She did harm. By the way she panicked, I feel like this isn't the first time a person's heard her talk badly about patients. \n\nIf that were me, I'd report this. Why? Because nursing is an extremely toxic career to be in and far too often nurses that are toxic float on by because nobody wants to report the person that's helping them because they feel bad about it like you do. \n\nJust like any other job, if you fuck up you're going to face those consequences. Them's the rules. Maybe this will be the wake up call she needs to change her heart.", "NAH \n\nIf every hospital interaction went this well we'd all be less stressed going. \n\nYou had legit concerns, addressed thenm reasonably, the nurse was contrite. \n\nThe crying prolly was related to all little embarrassment and exhaustion...but people who work stressful jobs in stressful workplaces have to remember that their patients are also confused, scared and existing there feeling totally at their mercy. \n\nWater under the bridge", "NTA.  I was hospitalised a few months ago for haemophilia influenza.  A couple of nurses I would  hear bitching about the full ppe they had to use to come near me (gown, face shields, gloves etc) .  I had nebulisers every couple of hours that  had to be turned off when finished.   Funny that the bitchy nurses had to come in to turn off . Other shifts I would turn off myself to save them the trouble.", "NTA, stressful job aside there is no earthly reason to be rude to patients and their families in anyway.   \n\n\nSure shit talk can eventually happen but don't do it when your patients are able to see it, sounds like karma.   \n\n\nOnly reason she's sorry is she didn't want you to complain.", "NTA. Nurses and doctors, at least where I\u2019m from, have extensive trading in Not taking their frustrations out on their patients nor slandering them to third parties.", "NAH - Some people tell jokes when they are stressed, others vent. It was inappropriate of her to make that comment to the tech, but I don't think it makes her an AH. It was perfectly fine for you to call her on it. \n\nGet your dad a medical alert bracelet that has his pacemaker model number on it. He should already have one in case something happens to him and he loses consciousness when you/your mom are not around. It would be important for EMTs to know he has a pacemaker and have the necessary information about.", "YTA . ER nurses are top notch. She was trying to do her job while your dad is joking around and your mom having a panic attack. You eavesdrop a private conversation and then yell at the nurse until she\u2019s crying? I wonder why we have a shortage of nurses.", "NTA she should be more professional and patient", "You said you were an RT in an ER. Did you ever get frustrated with patients and just complain about them to your coworkers? Did you ever just need to talk to someone and get your frustrations and anger out? If yes, then YTA. \n\nPeople need to stop thinking of doctors and nurses as superheroes. They are humans who get tired and frustrated and angry. They are allowed emotions. And the  nurse never said anything to your family or did anything to interfere with her duty to care for your father. \n\nAnd all she was that your family was out there? Thats it? Based on your own words, thats an approriate description. The fact that you were worried about your father doesnt mean you can take that worry out on others.", "NAH.  I have a rather weird way of dealing with stress when I\u2019m about to go under for surgery, and it\u2019s not something that most medical professionals really like: when I was getting prepped for surgery on my fractured femur, I started going on and on about a show that I liked at the time, Code Black.  Not exactly the kind of show that you want to hear about, much less watch, when you\u2019re a medical professional, as it deals with situations where the influx of patients in an emergency room far exceeds the resources available.", "NAH", "NAH there arent many jobs as or more stressful than er nurse. or nurse in general. doesnt make it any better tho. but still. being off isnt that hard an insult. i see myself as being off the chart", "ESH if you've survived a job like that you know how it is. \n\nHowever you were right to mention it.  Next time it could be a family who put in a formal complaint.  You may have saved her from that.", "NAH. She looked after your dad is overworked and underpaid.

But they should make sure that doors are properly closed.", "NTA, she should have been more professional", "NTA.\n\nI'm a little on the fence about this one. Not with you, you were well within your rights and should have spoken out about it.\n\nI'm just on the fence about the nurse, I do think she was being an AH, although the job is stressful and she may not have been used to the humour or atmosphere. She could have had a long and stressful day. However, although these are all relevant and I think I would give her a pass, it could have gone differently and she could have been overheard and this might have had a negative impact on your family.\n\nI think you did the right thing, she may have been getting complacent and sometimes even the best people might have to re-evaluate how what they are saying, might affect others. She should learn from and move on. If she is crying it is not your problem, but there might be other issues at play. At that point, I think it is important to accept the apology gracefully.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't pass on the apology or say I would, because I wouldn't bring it up with the parents in the first place. It's not something that would benefit them by knowing and I would not lie about it either.", "I agree with the NAH. \n\nShe defiantly didn't intend for anybody, especially op to overhear, Op was defending her parents. The nurse was just having a bad day, and clearly sincerely apologized for it, and even op felt a bit bad. No assholes here, just a human having a bad day and one reacting to it, both cooled down and realized and owned up to there mistake. So definitely no assholes.", "Yup. You didn't go to her supervisor and yell and scream; she didn't double down and add to the insult or brush you off. You were both stressed, and expressed your frustration in ways that happened to hurt another human being, but neither of you intended to be hurtful.", "She was in a public, open space, of course people was going to overhear. She just didn't care.", "I agree. NAH.", "Hopefully the nurse learned that when you say something in a public, open space people will unsurprisingly overhear it.", "Also crying is important sometimes. She realised she fucked up and feels bad about it. That\u2019s a good thing!", "What\u2019s the problem if they are the venting about the PPE? You aren\u2019t the PPE.", "For sure my coworkers and I complained about patients.  But we had a break area for employees only where we did it - never on the floor.\n\nBut your point is well-taken as far as people needing to understand the stress of the job and the normal-ness of medical workers needing to vent frustrations.  I believe that\u2019s why I felt so bad after the adrenaline of the moment passed.", "Where I work, nurses having a break off the floor is a rarity - and the nursing station is the closest to an employee-only area we ever see.  \n\nBut I agree with previous posters - NAH.  Just a lot of stressed out/burnt out people."]}
