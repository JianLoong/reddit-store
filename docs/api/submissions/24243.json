I don't want to make a generalization, but those comments tell me that people probably don't have experience with medical neglect/discrimination from staff on the basis of being \"unliked\", \"annoying\", or \"too responsive\". I have, and it is the worst thing to experience someone dismiss your very real pain because they think you are acting \"off\" or \"annoying\".\n\nSure, the nurse could have been blowing off steam with the comment.

At worse, it's another case of \"well, I don't like them because they're weird/off-putting/annoying and I'll let that judgement cloud my medical care.\" It's good that she apologized, but OP's responses both times were not too extreme and I think they handled it incredibly well.

I live in the United States, so the fact it's going to cost an arm and a leg (even with health insurance) just to be sitting in this room for 30 minutes, it very pissed me off to hear the smack talk coming from someone I expect professionalism from.\n\nHowever, I think in this situation, the nurse had a \"heat of the moment\" situation that just came out. She took time to stop you and apologize multiple times and even admitted she had a long day.\n\nI also want to note that you saying something to her was a good thing and will hopefully teach the nurse a valuable lesson in the future. \n\nIt happens to everybody. I feel like in this situation, the incident is forgivable.", "NTA. A lot of people think they're morally perfect and become extremely emotional when presented with evidence they're not. \n\nThere's no way this is the first time she's talked shit about a patient or their family. She wouldn't have been doing it confidently where she could be overheard. She can't reconcile her judgement of the behavior with the fact she is exactly that person. That's not on you", "She was probably worried you were going to complain. \n\nShe was inappropriate. You dealt with it appropriately. She apologised. End of. \n\nNTA", "you answered your own question. you both aren't.", "NTA. Anyone criticizing a patient where others can walk by is the A. \n\nMy mother survived in ICU after wonderful care. She was stepped down to PCU and her systems (bowels) began working again. Gas was foul. \n\nHer nurse said to someone else at the desk, \u201cthere was an elephant in room xxx.\u201d  I was in the nearby waiting room. I pre-apologized to some man in the waiting room with me and went OFF. \n\n\u201cMy mother survived. She is returning to health. Big surprise.\u201d Etc. Etc. Everyone at the desk was sheepish. \n\nI also wrote to the hospital\u2019s ombudsman.  It\u2019s up to them to resolve or discipline. \n\nOP did the right thing.", "I work in the ER. It's a stressful environment and sometimes people say things that they have no business saying, patients and staff. You had every right to confront her and she had every obligation to apologize. She will also think twice before venting about a patient in this manner which is unprofessional at least. After that I wouldn't think too much of it.\n\nBTW your dad's style of making light of things is my absolute favorite patient to work with. Getting sick is rough and stressful. Joking helps to deflect and cope with that. We can get so much done with even the appearance of positive behavior. I wish you guys the best.", "If she feels so comfortable with insulting patients in very public settings, does she really care for her patients? I'm guessing her sighting was the least of her bedside manner issues.\n\nETA: NTA, I get that the job can be difficult, but she is dealing with people on some of the worst days of their life and needed to be reminded to respect them.", "NTA. You taught her a valuable lesson in a pretty gentle way, all things considered. And it seems she has taken it to heart, which is great, because she never should have been saying things like that out loud in the first place regardless of whether she didn't think she would be overheard.", "NAH -  I'm a strong proponent of not questioning or judging what workers do or say to cope with their job -  when done in private.   Nurse was dangerously close to assholish since you overheard but sounds like they genuinely didn't mean it and regretted it.", "Can\u2019t agree more with NAH. I was an ER nurse and it\u2019s the most soul-sucking job ever. We were constantly encountering verbal and physical abuse from some patients. While most of our patients aren\u2019t like that, being part of that environment for a long time will drag you down mentally, to the point that you don\u2019t even make the distinction anymore. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I no longer work there. \n\nIt would be one thing if she\u2019d doubled down (I\u2019ve definitely seen that) or had no reaction to being called out (seen that, too) but she sounded genuinely remorseful. Like, she definitely knew she fucked up and won\u2019t make that mistake again. She will probably carry that with her for a long time.", "Having a stressful job does not make it okay to sit at the nurse's station and talk shit about your patient and their family to a tech.  Especially where the patient's family can potentially overhear you.  It's one thing to need to vent, but do your venting on your own, in private, not openly to another member of staff.", "Just because the nurse is having a stressful job doesn't give her the pass to insult people.\n\nShe is definitely TA.", "Hot take maybe but NAH. She shouldn\u2019t have said that but it IS a stressful and heavy job. It really sucks you heard that but are we all perfect..........", "I'm a nurse, and I have definitely been called out by patients for my callousness before. You have to internalize it, feel like shit for your shitty actions, and try to do better in the future. Some lessons need a stark reminder, and I'm sure all you did was make her a better nurse in the future. \n\nOn a side note, I would go to hell and back with this nurse. Not everyone can take criticism, and she reacted perfectly. That's a good person right there. Hold onto those for dear life.", "ALWAYS make sure the customer left the store before complaining to coworkers.  ALWAYS.", "[removed]", "So, just because she has a stressful job and didn't mean for everyone to hear, she gets a pass?\n\nNTA. I'm tired of this sub not holding certain people accountable.", "That's much worse. The OP's nurse just privately said one slightly sentence out of earshot, she assumed, of the patients.", "This is the right answer. \n\nI can't take pain meds, and I had an ER nurse go off on me for going to the ER for pain. Called me a narc seeker and everything. I calmly told her repeatedly to go read my chart and finally had to use my firm teacher voice to go read my chart or find someone who would and have them treat me. All while I was in extreme pain and needed a kidney infection ruled out. \n\nShe stomped off and came back all contrite and apologetic a few minutes later, and I let her have it. Narc seekers are the minority, even in an ER, and even then, their pain should be controlled and they should be treated with humanity and dignity. She apologized and kept her head down the rest of the time. \n\nMaking assumptions about patients and then treating them badly is not what nurses are supposed to do, but too many do.", "Were they actually bitching about you or venting about the PPE though? Because even when there's perfectly good reasons to need the PPE, that shit can be incredibly uncomfortable if you have to wear it all day, and time consuming to put on and take off. Like it's necessary so nobody should be going \"Eugh why do we even have to bother let's just let everyone get infections\" but PPE is a pain in the ass so I can see someone going \"Eugh I do not want to spend X amount of time in this mask that is too hot and dents my skin\". But I can also totally see why you wouldn't want to hear that when you're the one who is sick it's like \"Oh I'm sorry your uniform is uncomfortable I have fucking pneumonia\". So I can see both sides.", "Yeah, to your husband though not in a place where your students can hear you. That's the key", "Imagine having a conversation in the middle of the hallway (that's what the nurses station is) in public and getting mad that someone nearby heard. \n\nNah. If ER nurses are top notch y'all wouldn't be talking shit about patients at all. Period. You got jobs to do and you get paid handsomely to DO those jobs. Be professional.", "OP didn't yell at all. She just said that she didn't like how the rude nurse talked about her parents. How about you actually read next time?", "This is a reasonable, common sense response. AITA isn\u2019t that sort of operation.", "Yes, it was only stressful for the nurse. Healthcare professionals should be in panick, but the patients and their loved ones never should. /s", "Your comment has been removed because it does not address the OP in good faith.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect a post breaks one of our rules, please report it instead of commenting. **Do not feed trolls**\r\n\r\nContinuing to post comments like this will lead to a ban.\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "A lot of nurses stations really aren't that private, all of the ones I've seen have been in the middle of bays so you can respond to situations faster. She got complacent and that is a rude thing to say about someone who is unwell and is seeking your care. (And don't even start because I work in hospital too so I know the drill and I still think the nurse was in the wrong)", "imagine judging a family based on their fright responses when their father and husband is in the hospital for a heart related issue that could easily kill him\n\nprofessional in talking bad about patients? that's a new one. do they offer a course now? or is just a toxic nurse thing, kind of secret menu deal?", "\u201cShe did the job she chose and then, in a public and open space, talked shit about your father during a horribly stressful and upsetting time. Be grateful.\u201d\n\nFixed it for you.", "Wtf why did this get downvoted?", "So exactly how does OP suck then?", "Jsyk it's \"definitely\". \"Defiantly\" means to be oppositional or confrontational in the face of authority. From context I don't think you meant that the nurse was being difficult.", "Have you never vented to anyone in your life? People vent to people when they think the people involved are not around.

Saying \u201ca little off\u201d is a somewhat nicer way of venting to the tech.", "I'm so sorry you went through something similar. \n\nMy mom was in the hospital years ago because she was having uncontrollable muscle cramping and spasms into her right leg. It started out less severe and she talked with the nurses normally. Then it became so that her whole leg and foot twisted with the spasm, I could literally see her muscles go solid and veins bulging. Her foot would bend at an unnatural ankle just to unconsciously release tension. \n\nAs you may imagine, this was INCREDIBLY painful. My mom, by that point, was sobbing and occasionally crying out (can't help that if you're in pain). Two separate nurses told me and her that she was being disruptive and that I needed to keep her quiet. The radiology tech told her she was being purposefully uncooperative because she couldn't control her leg movement during the spasms, and that she must not want help. The phlebotemist 'joked' that the other departments better find something wrong or they would throw her out for being a drug seeker. In a similar manner to OP, I later was in the hallway and saw the no less than 4 nurses laughing as my mother screamed, pointing at her room, calling her an award winning actress. I didn't confront them because I was a scared 19 year old, but oh what I wouldn't give to go back to that moment.\n\nTurns out she has a series of nerve conditions and spinal deterioration due to an autoimmune disease that caused the issue. She didn't find this out till last year because of YEARS of the same kind of neglect/discrimination. Nursing may be hard, but there's no excuse for talking poorly about people who's health you're responsible for, especially not out in the open.", "Because he is criticising someone for doing the same as he did in the past.", "I defiantly agree with you!", "Sure, but it shouldn't have been where people could hear her. OP was going to the bathroom, not sneaking around staff only areas. You don't insult customers on the sales floor, you take that to the stock room.", "I'm so sorry. It should never have taken that long for doctors to figure it out. \n\nToo many nurses were mean girls in high sy, and it shows.", "Nope. OP made it clear they talked about patients in PRIVATE spaces were people who are often going through something horribly traumatic can hear.
