It sounds like the kids play outside in the yard during most of the summer so adding the fence leaves them only in their dirty yard. They'll probably be stuck in their house and the parents will get tired of that fast. Being stuck around rambunctious kids 24/7 is tiring so it will surely give them the incentive to clean their yard.", "NTA you are entitled to space and if you viewed it with the fence it\u2019s fair to ask for it to be as it was shown to you", "NTA. They could clean up their side of the space if they want to use it. You pay for the outdoor space as part of your rent so should be able to enjoy as you please.", "YWNBTA - it's your space, I would totally ask the landlord to put it back up.", "NTA id be talking to your landlord for sure", "NTA. Not only call the landlord, but take video/photos and email it to them. Start a paper trail now in the event that they do break something. This way you can hopefully remain not at fault.", "NTA", "And getting hurt on his property! The fence was prolly there did a reason!", "I agree with this, however, it sounds like the landlord is the one who took the fence down in the first place, and they may not be willing to put it back up. Also, if the kids are throwing footballs, they can almost certainly still hit OP\u2019s walls and windows with them from across a fence. \n\nWhat should be happening is a talk with the neighbor\u2019s landlord to have them address the issue, in addition to whatever mitigations OP\u2019s landlord wants to make to their property.", "That\u2019s pure speculation. Since OP is asking their landlord to put the fence back up, their landlord is, presumably, the one who removed it in the first place.", "Or maybe the LLs have an amicable agreement about who can use the property. If OP starts pushing there's a chance she'll be the one to lose access if it turns out it belongs to the other LL. I wouldn't rush in assuming that she's in fact entitled to private usage of exactly 50%.", "OP does not own this property. They get no say if there is a fence, and certainly not how high it is. Their landlord would be paying for it.", "Most of this sub is extreme. The amount of adults screaming, crying, being entitled... most of this sub's problems could be solved with \"stop acting like children\". \n\nI don't think OP meant actual terror though. More likely just worried if the kids break the window they somehow might be liable for letting it happen by not doing something like the fence first.", "I was curious about this too. Since OP\u2019s asking for it to be put back up, presumably their landlord was the one who took it down in the first place. I personally would have inquired about it when I took possession, because the unit would not have been in the same state as agreed to when shown the place.\n\nMaybe it was just OP\u2019s choice of wording though, and the fence belonged to the neighboring property.", "The landlord would be willing to put it back up if it kept their home from being damaged.", "\"Thinking about asking\" That the landlord took it down or had it removed himself is also pure speculation.", "Whether or not they own it is not really relevant. If they tell the landlord that there is serious concern about damage to the property, then they would most likely put up the fence.", "In theory, sure, but the issue might just as easily be solved with talking to the other landlord. Also, we have no idea why the fence was taken down to begin with. I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell OP they have a slam dunk of getting a fence because we know nothing about their landlord.", "> That the landlord took it down or had it removed himself is also pure speculation\n\nSince OP was asking their landlord to put the fence *back up*, it sounded like they (the landlord) were the one who took it down. I suppose it could have just been their choice of wording though.", "Sure, they should absolutely tell them, but you saying \u201cmake it a high one\u201d was what I disputed. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s property, and it\u2019s not particularly probable they\u2019ll get a say. Also, since OP is asking their landlord to *put the fence back up*, that means the landlord is likely the one who removed it in the first place, so they may not be willing to put one back up.\n\nFirst and foremost, OP\u2019s landlord should be reaching out to the neighbors\u2019 landlord to address the situation, then put up whatever other mitigations they deem necessary.", "It does matter in the sense you told them to put up a fence and they can\u2019t legally do that themselves.", "I wasn't literally saying for them to put it up themselves. I was implying that their desire is justified. \n\nAre you just bored, and looking for something to pick a fight over?", "No, but you absolutely told them to put up a high fence. You could have just as easily said you should explain to your landlord why you need a high fence installed. I never thought you were telling them to install it themselves, simply pointing out OP ultimately has no say. Seems like you\u2019re the one who wants to argue.

Asking the landlord to do it simply means OP can't make big changes like that without an ok. Any ideas about who removed the fence is all speculation. It may have been mandated by the city for violating codes for all we know.", "It's definitely just the wording. Both of you are reading into something that's not there. Fence was there when viewing the property, it was gone upon move in. OP wants the yard returned to how it was at viewing.", "NTA.

Maybe if they have to deal with the consequences of their actions they'll clean up.", "Have you asked the landlord why the fence was taken down? \n\nIf the landlord resists putting a fence up after you tell them the windows are at risk, make sure they understand that they are accepting responsibility for the eventual breaking of those windows. \n\nAnd if those kids don\u2019t understand English, hang on to that football when it next goes onto your property, take it inside, and wait for that knock on the door.

Maybe the landlord will build a fence. Or maybe they'll replace a window. Or maybe they'll do neither and nothing happens.", "NTA but tell the landlord immediately. In my country you would have a duty to inform to give him the chance to prevent damage. Otherwise you would have to pay for damages yourself. \n\nIf he is unwilling to do anything about it say you want to reduce the rent because you can not use the garden so you it won't pay for it.", "NTA.
