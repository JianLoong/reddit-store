I also do the bedtime routine because the kids especially my youngest as she\u2019s BF want me. He will usually do cleaning sweeping mopping litter box. Typically he will get up with the kids for me to sleep in however he has trouble getting up early and doesn\u2019t set an alarm. So if my mom is gonna pick up my daughter at 6:45 I\u2019d start waking him up at 5:45 and he won\u2019t get up and say he\u2019d drop her to school. Then when he does get up he takes forever to get her ready so she\u2019s late.

Only reason I stopped working was cause of the pandemic. During which time I was helping him finish his schooling. Also I can\u2019t do med school part time or work cause I\u2019m not in the US the program isn\u2019t structured that way", "And his job? What are the conditions like? Does he WFH?\n\nAlso why tf is it your responsibility to wake up your husband? Why does he not set an alarm?", "He is good during daytime hours. It\u2019s the waking up on his own and putting them down to sleep. My youngest is breastfed so she nurses to sleep. \n\nWe are on one income now and paying for pre school. When my internship starts I make close to double his salary. Most definitely have to get a second car. A nanny or housekeeper is hard because neither of us is home very much he works in healthcare as well albeit in a much less intense capacity. I don\u2019t want to hire someone especially as crime is very high in my country and my GM would be home alone alot now", "That\u2019s kinda the point I don\u2019t get to study for 8 hours. If my husband is home he still wants help he will sort himself out for work and I have to get both kids ready. Right now there has been a basket of laundry I washed and folded that\u2019s been there almost a week and hasn\u2019t got packed away because I haven\u2019t had the time. If he does breakfast the kitchen is in absolute shambles. \nI have to go with him when he\u2019s finished with work usually between 4-6 depending on how he\u2019s worked then I get home help settle them bathe them\nPut them both to bed I\u2019m not done till 10/11. Then if my mom is dropping off our 2 year old and he has to get her ready cause I was up late he doesn\u2019t set an alarm so I wake up wake him up he still takes forever to get out the door. This is ontop of me setting her uniform out the night before and packing her lunch bag", "understandable, I just wouldn't call your current situation as \"the husband is not pitching in\"\n\nI can see how your husband would get upset if you ever framed it that way", "He works in the hospital. Where he is at right now pretty much once he goes to work and gets his task done for the day he can leave. \n\nHe won\u2019t wake up. He sleeps through alarms or turns them up. I don\u2019t sleep well so most times either I\u2019d just wake up automatically or my mom would call me to let me know when she\u2019s leaving.", "The information you've given us in your main post (he doesn't cook if he is tired, he woke you up three times in the process of making breakfast) doesn't sound like he's very good during daytime hours", "None of this fits with your statement that he \u201c[good during daytime hours](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13l2kl4/aita_for_sending_my_kids_away_for_a_month/jknhnvd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)\u201d.

It sounds like the bills are paid, the fridge is full and there are money for nanny and daycare, which is not a small contribution\n\nfrom here:\n\nit would make sense to hire a cleaner for these couple of weeks to get the bulk of the housekeeping done, your husband should be responsible for the rest of it (while you should acknowledge that the house won't be perfect and it's OK) as well as about 4 hours of watching the kids between 4-10pm (you should probably go to a library to properly study)\n\nthen you are better suited to do the nighttime routine, since you are breastfeeding, and kick the day off in the morning, since he seems to be struggling with rise and shine gig, before you drop the kids off and go to library/campus/coffee shop to study again, until you pick up the kids and bring them home for him to watch", "Yeah I think the comment section is completely forgetting that side of the issue. The dudes keeping this entire operation funded. He's not \"doing nothing\", he's been the only breadwinner since 2020. And they had kids during that time. And he was finishing schooling during that time. \n\nI mean cmon. The guys not a deadbeat. OP is making unilateral decisions here, there's context that the top comments are missing.", "How did he get up for class/work before you?", "He is def not stepping up as a good partner would in times of crises, and he probably never will.", "was looking for these comments. and the contribution efforts. but some people cannot be held accountable and are pretty one sided. YTA to OP. figure out and balance out the situation.", "yes, I'm kind of wondering how they got here and whether he had a say in all this or OP just decided it one day, kind of like she decided to give away his kids", "He was and still is always late 75% of the time", "I am a heavy sleeper and I have ADHD. These lead to me being late if I don't put strategies in place (such as having multiple alarms set or using an alarm on wheels that rolls away so I have to get up and look for it). I can't believe his employers let him get away with being late that often. Just based on that, he's not a responsible adult. He may be the only income rn, but you always have to wake him up and make sure he and your (other) children make it where they need to be on time? Pffffffff. I can't tell you how to best deal with your current situation but I would say he doesn't sound like the most responsible individual and you are NTA for asking him to be more responsible about those things."]}
