My (28M) wife's (27F) best friend (28F) is staying with us from out of town for an extended weekend before she starts a new job. I'm always nice to my wife's friend, but the truth is, she comes from a wealthy family and desperately lacks common sense. I don't know if it's because of how she was raised, or something else, but it can be an issue sometimes.\n\nFor dinner tonight we ate a rack of ribs, baked potatoes, and some mac n cheese. Kudos to my wife and her friend for cooking, because the meal was delicious! As I finished my meal before the 2 of them, I started to clean my dishes along with the dishes they made since they cooked. As I'm gathering all of the items to bring to the sink, the best friend clears her half eaten plate with 2 rib bones into our sink and down the drain. I didn't even have a chance to say anything, and she says \"Is your garbage disposal any good?\". Before I can reply with, \"yes, it's great, but it isn't a food processor...\" she turns it on and almost immediately it jams up due to the shredded bones.\n\nI look at her and say \"have you ever had a garbage disposal that just grinds up bones?\". Maybe it was a bit rude, but I was visibly frustrated and don't feel like my property was being respected at all. I did everything I could to try and clear the jam, but there were multiple bone shards lodged and my blade was bent too. \n\nI told her I'd order a new one, replace it myself, and if she could just give us $100 for causing it to break, we could call it even. She then said \"why not call a plumber? I feel like it would be much cheaper than $100 to fix it.\" Seriously?!?! Most plumbers will charge $100 just to get you on the schedule to come out! I told her even if a plumber did come and clear the jam, the unit is still damaged and I would want it to be replaced. With parts alone, it's going to be $100 - $200 and that's not even including the labor that I'm willing to do. \n\nTo my surprise, my wife actually took her friend's side and said the unit was about 8 years old and probably would have gone bad soon anyways. Without wanting to argue with them both, I just told my wife we would discuss it tonight and then all chat in the morning. My wife and I just can't see eye to eye on this one so I told her I'm going to have the wonderful people of Reddit decide for us. I know it was an older disposal, but it never had any issues until tonight!

She broke the garbage disposal by doing something extremely stupid and now has to take responsibility for it, simple as that.", "NTA. She\u2019s very out of touch with reality. Who thinks they can put bones in the garbage disposal? And the amount from a plumber will be far more than $100. If your wife won\u2019t budge, then tell friend you\u2019ll get a plumber but she\u2019s paying entire bill. It doesn\u2019t matter how old it is, it wasn\u2019t broken before and now it is. The whole you break it, you buy it applies here.", "NTA. Garbage disposals can last for extremely long periods if properly taken care of. Shoving ribs down it is not taking proper care. If she's well-off, $100 shouldn't even be an issue for her either.", "NTA \n\nShe broke it. \n\nShe fixes it. \n\nNot rocket science", "NTA\n\nEven if it would have been 20 years old, it still worked fine as you say.\n\nTherefore she broke it, she replaces it. It's an easy concept.", "NTA \u2026that\u2019s crazy that she would do that ! I\u2019ve never put bones in my garbage disposal. I am guessing she never used one prior to last night? Any normal friend would say \u201cI\u2019ll help get it repaired I\u2019m so sorry\u201d then that would be the end of it. Maybe instead of telling her \u201cyou can put $100 to the repair\u201d tell her you could split the cost of repairing it. It\u2019s all in how you say it with some folks.", "NTA\n\nShe lacked common sense in a moment ( at the end of the day we're all human and I think we can admit that we are ALL guilty of this sometimes ) and broke your garbage disposal, from your explanation it doesn't sound like she was being intentionally malicious just not the sharpest tool in the shed for a moment. I think most people would agree she should pay for it, or at least have the tact to offer to chip in on a new one. \n\nHowever, this is your wife's best friend and she broke a fairly inexpensive item in the long run. Does she intentionally / unintentionally disrespect your property regularly or was this a one off situation? Is this the hill that you want to die on which will undoubtedly cause tension with your spouse and a guest that is staying in your house? Is the $100 inconvenience worth the mental tax from the tension? That only you can decide OP.", "NTA Garbage disposals can last up to 15 year (when you're not shoving rib bones down them)  Your wifes friends lack of common sense could be excusable if she actually took accountability and wasn't rude in her response.  She broke it she needs to pay for it, simple.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nIn this economy?\n\nShe made an AH'ish decision, she has to pay. \n\nYour wife using the \"it might have\" excuse is wrong. Your disposer didn't get bad from old age. It did because an adult intentionally decided not to use her adult brain.", "NTA. \n\nI've never used a garbage disposal so I don't know if bones is a reasonable expectation or not, but either way she broke it so should pay for it. If she's relatively wealthy then $100 should be nothing. And who thinks it would be *cheaper* to call a plumber in??\n\nUnless there's something your wife is not telling you about the bff's financial situation?", "I'd be asking my wife is she has been feeding bones to the garbage disposal. If not, why is she giving her buddy a pass on destroying your appliances? Old or not, it used to work just fine until her friend messed up. I'd tell my wife, since she thinks this okay, then she can buy the new one and do the swap herself. When she balks at the idea, then again ask why her friend should get a free pass then? Ask her why are you expected to just sweep this away when you are the one doing the dirty work?\n\nYour wife needs as much a wake up call as her buddy. Birds of the feather.... Enabling her buddy's irresponsible behavior isn't doing anyone any favors.", "NTA. The life span of a garbage disposal is more than 8 years if used properly.", "Nta.\n\nThe appliance may be 'old', but it was damaged due to someone using it in a manner that it was not meant to be used. \n\nHaving a trades person attend, labour, and parts will be anywhere from $100 to $400. This is dependent on the machine being repairable and parts being available. If this particular model was discontinued, it may be harder to find parts. If it's not repairable, the cost will obviously rise.", "If the garbage disposal is 8 years old and the average life of a garbage disposal is maybe 12 years max, then you got 2/3 of the useful life value out of it.  Your wife's friend only needs to pay for 1/3 of the new garbage disposal because she only decreased the old garbage disposal's useful life by 1/3.", "NAH\n\nIt is reasonable for you to want your wife's friend to pay for breaking it, but it is also reasonable for your wife and her friend to feel like she shouldn't have to pay since it was a fairly inexpensive item.\n\nWhat if it wasn't something that was worth $100, but something worth $5 that she broke. Would you still want her to pay? What about something worth $10? Where do you draw the line? There's no correct answer to this question because different people simply have different opinions regarding this sort of thing.", "For 100$, i would not make a fuss and cause friction between your wife and her friend.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your initial 'bit rude' comment can be forgiven as a moment of frustration, but after that, gracious hosts are supposed to compose themselves and put the guests at ease -- not because the guests deserve it but because *your spouse* will appreciate it.\n\nSince this is your wife's friend, it would be better to have her be the one to privately bring up compensation.  If your wife then asked you to be the demanding one, that would be the time to step in.  If your wife asked you to let it go for the sake of the friendship, maybe you could honor that request (if it isn't a constant need).  \n\nI'd like to think that spouses try to make things go well for their counterparts, so I would hope your wife would appreciate your frustration and try to get compensation from a friend who can afford it, but if this friend is as clueless as you say, this might be a situation where the best your wife can do is try, fail, and then apologize to you for her friend's failings.", "Going to go against the grain here, hear me out before tearing me apart please...\n\nESH\n\n1. Yes there are some people in the world who do not know how to use a garbage disposal! I grew up in New York City where garbage disposals actually have been banned up until maybe 10 years ago. I live out of state, the first few times family came to visit me and help in the kitchen I had to explain what could and could not go into a garbage disposal.\n\n2. Accidents happen, especially when you have guests over. It doesn't sound like she did this deliberately.  It also sounds like she has no familiarity with plumbers or handyman coming to the house, that's unfortunate but not a crime some people are that's worldly than others.\n\n3. You probably could have been a little bit more diplomatic in handling it. It's possible you mine jacked her a bit and caught her off guard in the conversation, I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt that she was startled and confused as to what happened.\n\n***Question was the friend upset / repentant that this happened? What was her reaction? Did she feel badly at all for the situation? My sense is she could have been more vocal about the situation to you which is further fueling your frustration, This makes her stupid too.\n\n4. This is just me, but very often when I have guests over I have to remind myself that they are my guests and are likely to ruin something of mine. That's the risk of guests. When they are friends or family that I have invited over and there is an issue I usually suck it up myself. But I understand this is purely an individual thing and likely and older thing, I've been around for many years and have finally settled on where the juice is worth the squeeze for me.\n\n5. Is it possible to talk this out and just set boundaries for any future visits that if the friend is not used to something or hasn't used something to ask first? If you really want some money towards replacing the garbage disposal I would recommend asking for a contribution towards the new disposal as opposed to paying 100%.", "She is in the wrong, but she is a guest so I would let it pass.", "Plumbers in my area want $90 just for the service call fee. And I can tell you from experience they want closer to $400-800 to replace a garbage disposal.", "I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around someone putting rib bones into a garbage disposal\u2026", "This is the comprehensive reply.", "I tried to type out something like this and it just wasn't eloquent. Assuming it's a one off situation and the friend doesn't disrespect and break something every time she comes over I'd just let it go.", "I see what you are saying. I agree, he should get it repaired first, then hand her the more than $100 half of the bill. Agreed.", "Gracious host? GRACIOUS HOST??? OP pretty much kept his cool given the dumbass nonsense he had to endure from both his wife and her friend. And yet it was incumbent upon him to do more? \n\nRemind me to break something of value in your home, and then we can test how gracious you end up being. Because I cam assure you, you will fail. Then again, I am 90% certain this is the OP's wife (or her friend) that wrote this comment, and they are just trying to cover their ass. \n\nOP is NTA."]}
