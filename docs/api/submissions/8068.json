I told her I could include her in my hotel accommodations and would pay for food, tours, attractions, etc. She said she cannot afford the flight which costs about $700 since she is booking last minute. \n\nShe asked me if I could buy her plane ticket and I told her I did not budget for another plane ticket and that I thought it was already fair for me to pay for other things on the trip for us. She said she really wanted to spend this vacation with me and said this could be her early anniversary/birthday gift to her and I would not need to buy her a gift. I told her another plane ticket was not in my budget. She said I make more money than her and I should be able to afford it I just don't want to take her. I told her I would love for her to come but I cannot buy her plane ticket because I did not budget for it and I have other financial obligations. I told her she either needs to pay for her own ticket or I'll see her when I come back home. She told me to forget about it because I am acting selfish when we are supposed to be a partnership and said \"hopefully I will still be here when you get back\".", "created_utc": 1674488133, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jf9xh/aita_for_telling_my_gf_she_needs_to_buy_her_own/", "score": 13498, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

These other expenses would be much more than her airfare if she were to split thst with you.  \n\nAs she wants early birthday present, perhaps she needs to ask those who normally give her presents to contribute and she should think of some over time or side gig to get the $700", "NTA - you were very generous to accommodate her with all of the other vacation elements.\n\nI would recommend sitting here down and telling her that you need to have a serious and honest discussion about her reaction. Is she lashing out because she's extremely disappointed she can't go and had her hopes up? If she apologizes sincerely, I'd say there's room to work on this/move past it (in my opinion).
