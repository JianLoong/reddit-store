Mom died when I was 14 and he was 6. Prior to his birth I remember her being a really involved and attentive mom. But once he was born she acted like he was her only kid and I was treated like an adult. As he got older I saw she treated him so much better than she ever treated me before. It made me jealous and resentful.\n\nOnce my brother started school mom would get up so early in the morning to cook him a school lunch. Something she never did for me. Also something she didn't do for me while doing it for him. About once a month I would get a cheese sandwich for school. Otherwise she told me to get lunch at school. Our school lunches were shit so it hurt me more that she was okay with me eating the shittiest food while waking up at 4am to make my brother lunch. I used to hear her up and she'd make so much noise doing it. She'd also make sure to pack it in a way that it would stay warm for him. Other stuff was that she would take him out for special days and leave me behind. Or when I did tag along she would yell at me to hold his hand if he wanted to and I didn't. She would tell me he was \"our world\" and I should be stepping up more as a brother. She told that he was important and should get whatever he wanted. My mom's parents noticed and pulled her on the stuff. But she dismissed them.\n\nThen mom died and I chose to go live with my dad, who I didn't know, over my grandparents, because they were going to be taking both of us, and I wanted away from him. We lost contact for 15 years until 3 years ago when they tracked me down. I'm still not close to my brother. I no longer resent him. I went to therapy to work through all that. But therapy didn't make me start loving him. I hadn't back then and I still don't today. Though our relationship isn't bad. Being a dad of two has made me more disgusted with my mom.\n\nAnyway, my brother has a girlfriend and she is apparently bothered by the fact I never made up for the past and didn't grovel to my brother. She believes I should be all about him now. She decided to stop by unannounced at my house and said she wanted me to explain why I'm not making more of an effort to be close to my brother and to make up for lost time. She said he would yell at her if he knew but she felt like I had explaining to do. I told her I was not going to explain myself to her. She told me she needed to know. That she loves my brother and she knows he has adored me since he was born and she cannot understand how I ever resented or blamed him. She told me to fuck the little boy I was because he was a baby and I should have known better and she didn't care if \"my mommy hurt my feefees\" because I crushed his. I made her leave and refused to explain. She told me I was a dick and was clearly hiding shit. She sent a string of texts after that too. So I blocked her.

The reason I question my actions is she clearly loves him and I think maybe she just wants to know what she's getting into when it comes to his feelings about me.

If you have any communication with your brother, let him know she isn't welcome to contact you, and why. You don't owe her confidentiality, or anything else.", "Absolutely NTA!! First off, why is your brother's girlfriend inserting herself into yalls business?? She also needs to realize that forgiveness does not mean reconciliation is required. She has no business at your house or in your business. Even if she and your brother were married, she needs to understand that going to battle it out with your spouse's family for them does nothing but brew more tension and in many cases has your spouse's family members lose any respect they had for you.", "Slam the door in her face and tell her through the door if she shows up again it\u2019s trespassing and you will get a restraining order against her.", "NTA. None of this is any of her business. If your brother wanted to try and rekindle a relationship then it\u2019s on him to approach you himself\u2014but you\u2019re not obligated to want anything to do with him either way. He\u2019s a stranger to you at this point, honestly", "NTA. Send your brother copies of all the texts and tell him she came to your house. If you don't that crap storm is going to keep blowing into your life.", "Wtf is that girl doing randomly showing up at your house, basically calling you names and then trying to force you to explain stuff that has absolutely nothing to do with her. If she asked you to explain to your brother, she would maybe have a point (if she didnt ambush you) but saying that SHE has to know? Absolutely mental. \n\nNTA for blocking her. You can have a conversation with your brother about how you both feel about everything and go from there. But do it on your own time. Forced family situations never work out well.", "NTA.  You don't have any explaining to do, especially to her.  She doesn't 'need to know'.  Great that she loves your brother, that doesn't have anything to do with you.

You and your bro had two very different experiences in childhood. He has a rose-colored version, where everything was magical and happy. That's not what you got. You were traumatized and frankly, abused by your mother.

You moved on and are still dealing with that trauma, keep at it. \n\nHe is totally fine to want a closer relationship with you, but he's not entitled to one. And you have nothing to \"make up for\" either. You did nothing wrong here. Everyone seems to be forgetting you were a child who also lost their mother too. Why are his wants and desires the only important thing in this situation? You can't force closeness. If he is \"crushed\" that you aren't closer, that's his problem to deal with, not yours. You are practically strangers now. Carry on and don't be afraid to establish boundaries that are in YOUR best interests.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell him exactly what she said and did.

People don't get to call you on your decisions, even after therapy and whatever work you went through.  Fix your feelings for yourself, which is sounds like you did.  If you want to tell her a bit, it sounds like she's doing the whole \"seek to understand, not to judge\" thing.   But its totally your decision, she needs to respect that.  GL!", "NTA. You have absolutely no reason to explain yourself to her. She overstepped, but it seems to have come from a place of care. You may have addressed some of the trauma, but that also means attempting to establish an actual relationship with your brother. He was a kid with a clear age gap. Your mums treatment of you both has nothing to do with what your relationship should be like. You chose to leave him behind instead of deal with the baggage. Think about how that may have hurt him too. His big brother who he probably thought the world of couldn\u2019t stand his existence and disappeared for 15 years. To me, you seem only half healed. This may be a conversation for the two of you, but his GF needs to butt out. However, If she\u2019s gotten involved to this point, she\u2019s obviously done it for a reason. It\u2019s probably eating at him and he\u2019s scared to press on it for fear of losing you again. \n\nBe a big brother for once. Step up. If it solves nothing, there is nothing lost here.", "NTA for not wanting to explain yourself to her, but I'm going against the grain here and say she's not an entitled brat as everyone else here is saying.\n\nShe obviously cares about her boyfriend, and it's apparent that your distance to your brother is eating away at him.  He doesn't want to reach out to you out of respect, but it's obvious that he wants to connect with his big brother and he doesn't know what he did wrong.\n\nTo her credit, she took an initiative to help her boyfriend in a way he couldn't do himself.  What did she have to lose? Your relationship with your brother is non existent as it is.\n\nI actually applaud her courage for taking an initiative to help her boyfriend that he couldn't himself and you won't.  Obviously her method could've been more refined, but I can't fault her for trying.", "NTA. But your resentment to your brother is ridiculous. He didn\u2019t do any of that to you, that was your MOTHER. If your little brother really looked up to you and adored you, when your Mom passed, he lost a Mom & Brother. The best thing for you to do, would be to contact him, let him know how much you hate him, and don\u2019t want him in your life. He\u2019ll be better off without your horrible attitude towards him. It\u2019ll sting for him to hear that, but he can then move on with people you truly want him around and care for him.", ">She said he would yell at her if he knew but she felt like I had explaining to do.\n\nJust a bit full of herself, isn't she? She's got no standing to demand explanations.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I'm still not close to my brother. I no longer resent him. I went to therapy to work through all that. But therapy didn't make me start loving him.\n\nI don't think you worked through everything. You are clearly still holding your mother's wrongs against him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>she knows he has adored me since he was born\n\nMeanwhile, your attitude is \"fuck him, I couldn't care less\", and the only reasons you provide have to do with your mother's actions.\n\nIf you really worked things through and didn't \"resent\" him, why would you never contact him? Why go no contact if he never wronged you?  It's not like \"love\" and \"hate\" are the only two possible ways to feel about a person. It's possible to reconnect with someone even if you don't \"love\" them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee, this is what I hate about some AITAs. I have to vote in a way that probably means it doesn't count. Specifically,\n\nNTA for not giving her explanations.\n\nYTA for icing out your brother instead of at least trying to talk to him, while claiming you worked through your unfair resentment of him.", "NTA about her, she was out of line and TA, you don\u2019t have to explain anything to her.\nInfo: Has he been trying to reconnect with you? What she was saying about him adoring you and you not making an effort to reconnect makes it sound like he wants to. I certainly don\u2019t expect you to just get over it, but your mom\u2019s behaviour isn\u2019t his fault, so if you\u2019re refusing to try to reconnect then mild YTA.", "ESH\n\nHer because it is not her place and you because she is right.
