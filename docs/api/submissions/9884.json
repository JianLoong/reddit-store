I got laid off during the pandemic and instead of looking for a new job, I kind of became the de facto stay-at-home parent.  It wasn't planned, it just kind of happened.  Our daycare was closing every other week so it made sense to pull our 2 youngest out of the center and keep them home.  We made it work financially, but barely.  My wife was constantly stressed by being the sole breadwinner.  \n\nOur middle child started kindergarten this past fall, so I started my job search up again.  I will admit I was being kind of picky and eventually my wife told me to just get a job, any job.  I ended up finding one that was within my field and paid well, but it would require some travel during the first 6-months or so for training.  My wife told me to just take it and I can always look for a new job.  I really didn't want to take it, but I did because of how stressed I could tell my wife was.\n\nMy first travel for this new job was between Thanksgiving and Christmas.  It was for 3 days.  I would call every night to check in at home and my wife was always flustered.  She would pretty much just hand the phone to one of the kids and run off to do something or deal with another kid.  It made me feel incredibly guilty about being gone.  \n\nThis week I am traveling again and will be gone for an entire week.  For the past 2-3 weeks leading up to this trip, I've been talking with my wife about anything I can do before I leave to help make this trip easier for her but she kept telling me that she had it under control and that she learned a lot from my last trip.  Her sister was supposed to come and help for a few days, but had to back out because of a situation with her own family.  \n\nI ended up making a few lists and some post-it notes around the house to help remind my wife of some things about the kids.  I wasn't doing this because I don't think she can handle it, but the last trip made me feel like I didn't do enough to help her.  I've also spent a lot more time with the kids over the past 2-3 years than she has.  \n\nBefore I left, I mentioned the notes and lists to my wife and she immediately got defensive.  She accused me of thinking she's a bad mom and that she's incapable of handling a single week by herself with the kids.  I told her that wasn't the case at all, but that I just wanted to be more helpful than I was last time I was gone.  \n\nI apologized for making her feel that way and reminded her that I just wanted to help.  She told me she doesn't need my help and she can handle it on her own.  I honestly didn't think she would react this way at all, but maybe that is my own fault.  \n\nI know it can be very hard to watch 3 kids by yourself.  I know it's even harder when you're working full-time at the same time.  Which is why I tried to be proactive about offering support before I left.  But my wife's reaction is making me feel like I overstepped and I should have trusted her ability.", "created_utc": 1676317930, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111i79t/aita_for_leaving_postit_note_reminders_and_lists/", "score": 91, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife leaves me lists whenever she is gone for several days.  I will say, you are overthinking this.  Your wife is right that everyone is going to survive your absence.  She will do things differently than you would, but different is the not the same as wrong.", "NAH - you were trying to be helpful, she did not want the help, you apologized.\n\nI think you\u2019re going to get plenty of Y T As here, but you were the primary caregiver for 2-3 years and your intention was to be helpful. If this was a SAHM leaving notes for dad being left alone with the kids I doubt anyone would bat an eye", "Hehehe. I can only only imagine how opposite the AITA mob\u2019s reaction would be if the husband were asking if he\u2019s TA for getting defensive and sulky because his wife left a few post-it note reminders around the house. NTA.", "INFO: What exactly was on these notes?", "NTA-intent matters. There is no way I'd be offended if my husband left reminders for things.", "NAH, you two are just out of sync at the moment.", "NAH you were trying to be helpful and it backfired. It happens. Apologize for inadvertantly offending her and move on. It sounds like you worry about your wife's stress level and now you know that making her a list doesn't reduce her stress. Try leaving her chocolates and a love note the next time you go away", "NTA, and if the roles were reversed here, I am absolutely positive she'd do the same. You're the one who has done most of the day-to-day child wrangling for the past few years, so leaving reminders is you considering the fact that she doesn't know everything you were doing. It's in no way a condemnation of her mom abilities. It's something intended to help, and if she chooses to take that personally and refuses to see it for what it is, then that's on her.", "NAH, you wanted to communicate which is the right instinct.  Defensiveness isn\u2019t the best response on her part, post it\u2019s without a conversation aren\u2019t the most clear communication, but you\u2019ll both get there.", "NAH but you probably should've just asked her if she wanted you to write anything down for her instead of deciding she needed help after she said she didnt.", "info: what kind of lists or post it notes did you write? is it for things she tends to forget? or basic matters that she\u2019s never had a problem attending to?", "NTA - but you definitely could have communicated better and not via post its.", "Info - did she actually drop the ball on anything important while you were gone the last time?", "I'm torn between N.A.H. and Y.T.A.  \n\nYou made the notes so you'd feel less guilty, not to relieve stress or take something off her plate. That seems like a semantic difference, unless you think about how it's helpful to her. Unless she's exceptionally forgetful, it's not helpful in any way. It just made you feel like you were doing *something.*  \n\nParental guilt is something every decent parent struggles with. You're going to feel guilty when you can't be there, but you're also going to make her feel guilty/inferior if you try to make up for it by micromanaging her parenting while you're away. Maybe there's some practical thing you can do next time instead, like cooking extra meals and freezing them or doing extra housework before you take off/after you get back.", "Soft YTA. It\u2019s clear you only had good intentions, but put yourself in your wife\u2019s shoes. She doesn\u2019t need help remembering things, she needs help *doing* them. She already knows what she needs to do, she just feels overwhelmed. That is why your post-it notes came off as demeaning and unhelpful.", "NAH, since you clarified that you did help before leaving with costco/gas/etc. \n\nThe party info, IF SHE DIDN'T know it, maybe. The rest is a bit much, like leaving notes for a babysitter. \n\nShe's working full time, taking care of 3 kids while you're gone. As long as kids are fed/taken care of/going to school, if someone forgets one thing here or there, everyone will live. \n\nI think you are a bit anxious, and overdoing it with the post-its. \n\nShe will sound stressed when you travel for work, there is just no way around it. Just make sure not to call during dinner/bath.", "I would say NTA. I'm not sure why she got so angry tbh. Personally, I would've been happy that my husband tried to do something at least.", "NAH! Humans are amazingly adaptable. I was a SAHM. Some of it is control - you\u2019re used to a certain routine, so when your spouse does it differently, it can feel wrong. I see that you love your wife and family. I think the best way to help is to a) ask her how you can help b) trust her if she says no. C) trust her to handle it. Don\u2019t micromanage. Moms are able to handle a lot.", "Soft YTA\n\nYou should have asked your wife HOW to help her, or if she would find reminders like this useful.\n\nInstead, to her eyes, you set up constant visual reminders about how she might be falling short or how you think she's failing. \n\nShe is the one at home. She will come up with her own system. Sometimes keeping all the kids alive and fed and happy is the most important, and some things will naturally fall by the wayside. \n\nYou were only gone for 3 days. Even if your wife was overwhelmed, she managed. And 3 days of training for \"single parenting\" will take some practice. I think you're catastrophizing or want to feel missed and valued. \n\nYour wife will likely adapt, even if you're gone a whole week. Ask her how you can help. Maybe plan or freeze meals before you leave. Try to limit appointments during times you're gone. Do the kids have any sort of schedule or routine chores?", "Other than the contact info for carpool, the other note examples were sort of silly.  Your heart is in the right place maybe but she doesn\u2019t need a reminder that little kids exchange Valentines on Valentine\u2019s Day or how to feed her child at daycare.  Your notes imply she lacks basic knowledge of her own children.  \n\nI wonder if this isn\u2019t a passive aggressive move on your part because you are resentful about being pushed back into the workforce and into accepting this job.  I could be way off but I think you are motivated to think she\u2019s not as good as you are at juggling the kids and work.  And she\u2019s motivated to prove she can do it just fine so you don\u2019t try to use this as an excuse to quit your job (\u201cthe travel is too hard on you!\u201d).", "You did overstep. If she told you she didn\u2019t need help, you should have listened to her. That\u2019s why she feels like you don\u2019t think she\u2019s capable to do this all on her own as a mother.\n\nOn another hand, you\u2019re NTA. This all seems to come from love and care. However, you should still apologize to your wife.", "NAH\n\nYour intentions were good, but she said had it and sometimes you have to trust that. You didn\u2019t want to go back to work and you wife seems to have been dealing with pressure of you not working.\n\nYou are both figuring out the new normal and adjusting. \n\nDo you have a family calender that you write down happenings/schedule/etc? \nIf you don\u2019t, you may want one. We have one and it would have a reminder to buy the Valentine stuff as well as the date to bring it in. Sort of a family to do as well as what\u2019s happening each day.\n\nThe contact info should also be kept up to date regularly and accessible to both.\n\nWe have a babysitter/care guide. We made it in case something happened, we needed to go someplace short notice, an accident, etc\u2026. info would be available if we needed someone to come watch our child. \n\nContact info, doctors, friends,  school contact, insurance, allergies, medicine, schedule. If you work on that together, it will be there if you are traveling and other times. \n\nFind what works for your family.", "NTA- per your comments, you prepped the household for for trip (groceries, gas, laundry\u2026.) and the notes were really just reminders of what is happening on specific days and contact info for carpooling.\n\nPerhaps cut back on the details on the notes and make them just general family notes like on a shared digital calendar. \n\nAnd she will likely be overwhelmed and us dads go into fix it mode, like what can we do to fix this vs just listen. Super hard not to try to fix.", "I think NTA because your intentions were so good and you tried to communicate that to her but I think your wife is at a constant state of overwhelm (maybe anxiety or depression if this behaviour isn't out of the ordinary?) where anything, even the smallest thing added to her plate means she's instantly overwhelmed and frantic - which is why she was defensive and reacted the way she did", "The road to Hell is paved with good intentions, OP.\n\nYour intentions were good, but your actions means YTA.", "YTA\n\nReading between the lines, you really didn't want to work at all. Your wife had to basically demand that you got a job whole she struggled to pay the bills. That's unacceptable.

You have to travel for work, and she knows she has to watch the kids. You putting notes around the house does two things from her perspective: \n\n1. Puts pressure on her to do it her way. \n2. Shows you don't trust her to take care of the kids. \n\nUnless she asked for lists, you screwed up. I think you had good intentions, but this comes across as condescending and mistrusting.

If she said she could handle it- then she probably could have.", "Definitely NTA\n\nIt seems pretty clear that everything you are doing is motivated by wanting to help as much as possible, which is awesome.  I'm sure your wife is just stressed by everything that is going on, but just try to tell her again that nothing you did was at all related to thinking that she couldn't handle the job or was doing something wrong, you just want to do as much as you can to make things as easy for her as possible because you know she has so much on her plate.", "NTA and a definite keeper! Blessings. But even so,  miscommunications can happen.", "Softly YTA - Unless she asks for reminder notes, don't do it.  As a parent, I could see how she would think you don't trust her to get things done and is adding more stress because she feel like she has more on her plate.    You're not helping in a way that she would like.  It would have been much better to ask her how she can best be supported.  And leave post it notes about things you love about her that she can find.  And get as much done as you can to help her out before you leave (laundry, shopping, etc.).", "Did you do anything else to help before leaving? - buy groceries, clean the house, do the laundry, meal prep? \n\nIf she said she can handle it and you still only left post-it notes then YTA but IDK - you can't *make* anyone feel something...", "Post-it notes aren't \"help.\"", "NTA", "NTA , even if she didn\u2019t need it she could have just been grateful for the thought.

It seems like your intentions are good, but your wife is a grown woman and the three children are also her children; she's not a babysitter who needs to be reminded when to bathe the children and what to feed them. \n\nBy treating her as if she isn't capable of taking care of her own kids, you have insulted her and hurt her feelings.", "NTA.  I am a big lists and post its person.  Unfortunately, imo, not everyone is.", "Nta, but understand the other perspective. It would\u2019ve been more helpful to organize a play date, babysitter, or sleepover so mom gets a break.

Not because he isn\u2019t capable, but because I\u2019m the one who normally does the day to day routines with the kids because I wfh.\n\nWhen you get home I think you should sit down with your wife and just talk this out. Explain again where you were coming from, let her tell you why she felt the way she did, and then hopefully work through your feelings from there. Good luck!", "I say a soft YTA. \n\nYou meant well. You had good intentions. But I think that maybe doing more practical things to help her out would have been a better-received approach to helping her. Like, things around the house, or something, that you knew she's have to do, to help take the load off.   \n\n\nWhereas, I can see how she might get offended by notes left for her. And how she may feel like they were less helpful and more condescending. \n\nBut then again, maybe not. She is clearly tired and stressed and often we can be easily triggered in that state.

She has been a parent for as long as you have.", "If you wanted to leave notes for her you should have asked first.

Maybe she was stressed when you called because you were calling to back check everything she did and that was stressing her out? Your intentions are good but it sounds like she feels micro managed. If you want to compensate her for your trips maybe offer her a day off from parental responsebilities before or after your trip?", "NAH. If this was a wife leaving notes for a husband, there wouldn\u2019t be YTAs. It is clear that both of you have some internalized guilt around how childcare had been recently. It is Norma for the primary care parent to be nervous when leaving for any period of time and trying to make it easier on the other parent. There are so many little things that fall through the cracks so easily. \n\nYour wife likely feels guilty because society says it is the mom who is supposed to be on top of it all. \n\nY\u2019all need to have a frank conversation about what is going to work best for your family going forward and most of all, telling each other what you appreciate about the other person and their contributions.", "soft YTA\n\nYou meant well,  butmyou went about it in a condescending manner.\n\n\u201cBaby, what can I do to help before I go on the road?\u201d", "YTA only because she mentioned yourself that last time although she was stressed, nothing was missed.

If a wife needed to leave notes for her husband how to watch their kids, I would think that 1. She thinks he\u2019s incompetent of a parent 2. He isn\u2019t a capable parent. Your wife doesn\u2019t seem to fit those 2 things so didn\u2019t need it so it seems like you\u2019re diminishing her roles. \n\nIn your post, you don\u2019t mention your wife NOT partaking in being with your kids so why would she not know what to do?

A way to help would be(if you afford it) to hire here some help or going grocery shopping before you left.", "NTA - chances are she feels less than because of your position as the stay at home parent for so long, our society puts a lot of pressure on mothers to balance it all, and your stickies probably made her feel less than, and like you did not have faith in her ability to parent your kids. \n\nWhen you return, you two should have a talk - you ate both completely capable of parenthood. There is nothing wrong with leaving notes, but you should trust her more.", "NTA, because the first time I left my kids with my husband for 3 days I did the same thing.

You were trying to be helpful but it feels like criticism to your wife. If you don't think your wife is a bad parent, then let her learn to do the day to day stuff. And apologize and tell her that you trust her with the kids.", "YTA.  You don't leave \"to-do\" lists for the other parent.  That is incredibly degrading.  What you COULD do is: 1) Clean the entire house before leaving. 2) Find a maid to come in and clean while you are gone to help her keep up on things.  3) Wash all the clothes, fold and put away before you leave. 4) The weekend before you go, book a spa trip for your wife and keep the kids for the entire weekend while she gets a couple of days of relaxation to herself. 5) Pre cook some meals so she can pull out of the freezer and warm them.  6) Leave a gift card to her favorite place that delivers to save her from having to make each meal. 7) Go to the store and stock the fridge and pantry with snacks for her and the kids and things to make easy meals.  \n\nI really don't know how you thought leaving her \"reminders\" all over the house would be helpful.", "Weird you say that because everyone is saying NTA.\n\nEdit: sorry everyone was a hyperbole.

And some contact info for other parents to help with carpooling for our oldest's hockey practices.", "Not really.  No ER visits or anything like that.  I could just tell she was always stressed whenever I tried to talk to her.", "Well put. And also, should consider that the reason that she feels like she hasn't been able to spend as much time with the kids for the last few years is because she\u2018s been carrying the financial load, had to bluntly tell him that it was high time to get a job, and then tell him again to quit dawdling around waiting for the perfect job to materialize. While parenting alone is always going to be stressful, on some level this is stress that she is welcoming.", "Right? \n\nIf he wanted to help, he should have made some casseroles, done some meal prep, and made sure all the laundry is clean.", "When you're overwhelmed and help isn't coming, especially if you're used to it,  it's very easy to forget things.", "I'd prefer a husband who put out kids clothes for the week, did laundry and helped clean the house before leaving, not notes reminding me to parent.", "And it really depend if it was \u201cI don\u2019t need your HELP\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t need YOUR help\u201d", "Came here to post this exact comment.\n\nYTA but not on purpose op", "But a nights and weekends job would have been worse than one where travel is needed once in a while", "did you even read the post?

It is hard to work and handle kids and to think that your partner might think that you can't handle it, could come across badly, again, not that it was your intention.", "YTA - Taking care of all of the kids by herself 24 hours a day while you are gone is stressful. You are acting like her being stressed is somehow a failure on her part. It isn't. Stop undermining your wife's ability to parent. It honestly sounds like you are just trying to make her feel like a bad mom so that you can quit your job and go back to be a stay at home parent.", "That\u2019s totally fair, but many people don\u2019t have this problem and sometimes even have sharper memory under pressure.

Sounds like an amazing husband.", "Care to acknowledge that you were objectively wrong?", "OP - NTA, but these 2 are for saying you did anything wrong.  The people posting saying If the OP was a woman there would be no YTAs are completely correct.  You were the primary caregiver for awhile and your wife did not fair well during your first trip.

Update: He just loaded up at Costco so maybe he put stuff away she didn't know where. \n\nAre you saying there is no such thing as helpful notes that don't tell the partner how to parent?\n\nGender doesn't matter in their relationship for this issue, but it matters to this sub.

That's sexist.", "I don't know one person who has done this and a lot of people in my circle travel for work.", "Well this reply, in addition to the one with the contents of the notes, makes you extra firmly NTA in my book. Sometimes people really do take things too personally, and this is one of them. Hope everything goes well on the trip and for your family at home and that you can find a job more to your liking. Sorry that sexism is getting in the way of appropriate rulings here...and I say that as a woman, in case anyone decides to go off.", "OP says \"it wasn't planned, it just kind of happened\".
