We're not best friends of any sort but we're close to say the least, she's been with me throughout highschool, and we got close in college. I realised she's actually a very shitty person in the recent years we've hung out more often. She's always forced people who she's met to do drugs, and she's even convinced some minors to do weed with her. She's cheated on 5 out of 7 of her boyfriends and she has no shame for it.  She's overall a really messed up person, but she's never done anything mean or hurtful to me because I've told her very specifically that I wouldn't tolerate any disrespect. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nRecently, her boyfriend of 6-7 months cheated on her, and her ego was so butthurt that she'd stay salty all day. She'd ruin everyone's mood in our friend group , to the point where we'd just ignore her. One day she came to my dorm blackout drunk and asked me for some money to buy weed . I politely declined as I have no moral obligation to feed her addiction, neither am I spending on someone who has no basic humane ethics in life. She went into a rage state where she started bringing up personal details in my life that very few people know about and verbally abusing me. She even knocked over my pencil stand and I got so mad that I told her that she deserved to get cheated on and that no one really likes her, and if she ever wanted someone to truly want to be with her, she'd have to change her shitty personality. She paused her actions and looked me dead in the eye, muttering curse words and crying and leaving my room. Now that I think of it, She's never done anything wrong to me . She's been a decent person to me and I feel guilty saying what I did. She hasn't spoken to me ever since. Am i the asshole?

You should probably both apologize. Some people are late bloomers...", "NTA. What did she expect? Saying nasty things to you, being drunk and disrespecting your property. Yeah no I would have probably have said worse and not felt bad. It\u2019s the fafo effect.", "Lol; \"never done anything wrong to me\" immediately after describing her egregious behavior towards you? Like what?", "NTA\u2026 fast forward 5-10 years she\u2019ll be nowhere to be found. Trust me. If that\u2019s a pivotal moment in her life, you\u2019re doing gods work, but I suspect her shit show will go on. Say sorry if it makes YOU feel better, but cut the cord either way.", "NTA. She was being super annoying. People need to be put in their place from time to time, for their own good.", "A bit of ESH for this one. \n\nHer for continuing to visit her unresolved issues in toxic ways to the people she collides into, and then again for the drunk tantrum (RIP to our friend Pencil Stand)\n\nA little bit of it your way too for internalizing and letting fester your thoughts on her until they overflow in a heated moment, instead of reckoning with the conflict she stirs within and without.\n\nIt\u2019s complicated. She can be a mess and a jerk but so what? You got love for her anyway. Respecting yourself at the same time tho is hard when you\u2019re unrequited in giving your honest experience to her and maybe would like to be sure you\u2019ve gotten the same from her too.\n\nThis could be an opportunity to bring real to each other and give support if y\u2019all see fit. From your description tho, I would recommend seeing if you can prod her to find a therapeutic process for her chaos and be real about if her potentially toxic brand of wild is something you need to cut from.\n\nThe party is fun but it can\u2019t cover things up forever and will let her down in fantastically awful ways.", "NTA \n\nProbably didn't need to say those things though and you both have some spaces for accountability towards each other. \n\nUltimately though, neither of you sounds like a great friend.  You don't sound compatible.  Might be best to just let this friendship fizzle.", "NTA. Please separate yourself from this person- Friends have a very big influence on your life so surround yourself with good drug free people. You can't say that just because she has been \" nice\" to you she's good... My motto in life has been that I won't judge you based on how you treat me but rather by how you treat other people especially people in a lower standing than yourself.", "All the YTA comments gotta be coming from teenagers. This lady has no respect for herself, and barely any respect for you. NTA. Cut her out of your life.", "Do a nice thing for yourself and let this internet post be the last time you think of this person.\n\nGood luck!", "She hasn't done anything wrong to you.  Yet.\nWTH are you friends?\nESH.", "NTA.\n\nYou had every right to say what you said. She's got a lot of bad karma coming and being cheated on is just the start. Don't apologize. You have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA\n\nInitially your behaviour was unconscionable, but then you mentioned that she knocked over your pencil stand!!!\n\nHow did she not realise that your pencil stand was a relationship boundary after you calmly explained it to her!\n\nWell done for remaining friends with a sociopath, but calling reddit when she crossed your clearly defined boundaries.", "NTA cheaters don\u2019t deserve to be happy, she absolutely deserved to be on the receiving end for once", ">She went into a rage state where she started bringing up personal details in my life that very few people know about and verbally abusing me.

You both sound like shitty friends and tbh it doesn't even sound like you guys are friends anyway? Should've cut your losses earlier because \"she hasn't done anything shitty to me\" is not a decent enough reason to be friends with a person nor does it even equate to a fridship.\n\nYou suck because why wait until someone's that low to blow up like that? Why even care enough or be friends with someone you very clearly dislike and judge (other than to probably gossip about \"how much of a train wreck\" she is because let's be honest: A decent friend is no where close to being as judgmental or as hateful as you sound towards her)\n\n\nShe sucks because of, well, everything. I don't believe anyone *deserves* to be cheated on, but I'm also gonna shrug and say while she *didn't* deserve it, This is very much a \"just desserts/karma/own medicine\" type of situation imo", "Opie, do yourself and us a favor and end this \"friendship\", she is toxic. You don't need toxic people to wrong you first, before you have to cut them off\n\nETA, only because you were still friends with her, up to this point.
