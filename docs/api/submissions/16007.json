I should lose weight and I've started watching my calories and have already lost 10 pounds (although I need to lose lots more, it's a start).\n\nAnyway, my mom has many opinions on the clothes that I wear, specifically which ones I look good in. She has basically one shirt and one pair of pants that she likes that I wear for formal occasions because she says that they're flattering and slimming.\n\nI hate that set. I really like dresses and I've been gifted quite a few from family members that also fit me (I don't know if they look good but they cover all of me that needs to be covered). My sister (13f) is taller and thinner than me so my mom will give them to my sister before I've got a chance to wear them. They look good on her, and, in all honesty, I'd be fine passing on most of them to her if I at least got a chance to feel pretty in them once. She is gifted her own dresses, after all, that I never get to touch, so I'd really like to have a chance with my own.\n\nI've told my mom this and she basically doesn't car, and my arguments are pretty bad because I really have no concept of what looks good (I've pretty much let her decide my wardrobe because she won't insult it too much when she's the one picking out and purchasing every single outfit).\n\nI'm receiving an award at school and my mom wants me to wear the shirt and pant set. I asked her if I could wear one of my dresses. Why can't I wear the one that was bought for my birthday, that my sister wore to her sports luncheon? Because it's black and white and my mom thinks I should wear color. Why can't I wear the one that was a Christmas present, that my sister wore to her middle school awards? Because it's got cap sleeves and that's not appropriate.\n\nAfter I kept pressing my mom she finally admitted that she thinks the dresses look ugly on me. She says that my thighs make me look most fat and I need to de-emphasize them with slacks (I'd argue that an a-line dress would hide them better, especially with a tight top because my shoulders aren't as fat as the rest of me). She asked me why I'm so uncomfortable in my clothes, because if I really hate myself so much I should exercise more. I started crying because I have tried exercising and she's the one who mocked my every attempt until I was too afraid to move in front of her. She told me then that I looked ugly when I cried, so I called her ugly back.\n\nThat got her to stop talking to me, which was nice, but I'm now feeling badly. My mom told me that she's not going to help me any more if I won't take it nicely, and I can wear whatever I want and deal with everybody at school making fun of me for being fat. I'm not too afraid of that because my school has decent body diversity and I've literally never seen anybody make fun of anybody else for being fat. My mom's done the most making fun and has made me feel the worst about myself.

It doesn't make you immoral, or slutty or whatever horrible thing your mom told you. \n\nIn fact, when people feel good about their bodies, they are more likely to make healthy choices (exercise, healthy food, etc). Self hatred will get you nowhere other than a eating disorder. \n\nPut on your dresses. Put on makeup if it's something you think you'll enjoy, do something fun with your hair. \n\nTry, as best as you can, to ignore your mom.
