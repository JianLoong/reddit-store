I should lose weight and I've started watching my calories and have already lost 10 pounds (although I need to lose lots more, it's a start).\n\nAnyway, my mom has many opinions on the clothes that I wear, specifically which ones I look good in. She has basically one shirt and one pair of pants that she likes that I wear for formal occasions because she says that they're flattering and slimming.\n\nI hate that set. I really like dresses and I've been gifted quite a few from family members that also fit me (I don't know if they look good but they cover all of me that needs to be covered). My sister (13f) is taller and thinner than me so my mom will give them to my sister before I've got a chance to wear them. They look good on her, and, in all honesty, I'd be fine passing on most of them to her if I at least got a chance to feel pretty in them once. She is gifted her own dresses, after all, that I never get to touch, so I'd really like to have a chance with my own.\n\nI've told my mom this and she basically doesn't car, and my arguments are pretty bad because I really have no concept of what looks good (I've pretty much let her decide my wardrobe because she won't insult it too much when she's the one picking out and purchasing every single outfit).\n\nI'm receiving an award at school and my mom wants me to wear the shirt and pant set. I asked her if I could wear one of my dresses. Why can't I wear the one that was bought for my birthday, that my sister wore to her sports luncheon? Because it's black and white and my mom thinks I should wear color. Why can't I wear the one that was a Christmas present, that my sister wore to her middle school awards? Because it's got cap sleeves and that's not appropriate.\n\nAfter I kept pressing my mom she finally admitted that she thinks the dresses look ugly on me. She says that my thighs make me look most fat and I need to de-emphasize them with slacks (I'd argue that an a-line dress would hide them better, especially with a tight top because my shoulders aren't as fat as the rest of me). She asked me why I'm so uncomfortable in my clothes, because if I really hate myself so much I should exercise more. I started crying because I have tried exercising and she's the one who mocked my every attempt until I was too afraid to move in front of her. She told me then that I looked ugly when I cried, so I called her ugly back.\n\nThat got her to stop talking to me, which was nice, but I'm now feeling badly. My mom told me that she's not going to help me any more if I won't take it nicely, and I can wear whatever I want and deal with everybody at school making fun of me for being fat. I'm not too afraid of that because my school has decent body diversity and I've literally never seen anybody make fun of anybody else for being fat. My mom's done the most making fun and has made me feel the worst about myself.

My mom would make constant comments about my size and when I cried she\u2019d name call and demean me. \n\nOne of the reasons I was that size was due to years of an eating disorder after the school weighed us in 8th grade and sent home letters about fat camp. My mom said if I didn\u2019t do something about it, she would send me to the camp and make sure all my friends knew so they wouldn\u2019t be friends with me. \n\nMy weight continued to get worse and I am the heaviest I have ever been (though I am pregnant) and I am just now starting to have a healthy body image 11 years after my eating disorder happened. \n\nYou should feel good with any progress that you make that is a goal you want to achieve for your health/preference. Focus on getting healthy, not so much the number. \n\nDo not feel guilty about your comment. It was well deserved. However, I may be biased given my own situation with my mom and now being no contact. \n\nAnytime I expressed frustration as a teen, my mom would berate me and say \u201cwhy are you acting like that? Are you on your period?\u201d This really got old so I started responding with \u201cno. You\u2019re in a bad mood, too. Did you take your estrogen?\u201d (She took that after her hysterectomy) \n\nParents are meant to show you love. If she\u2019s not going to do that, then make a decision about how you want to spend the next two years. You can either clap back or insist on family therapy. Hopefully she\u2019s open to the latter as the former may lead to NC at some point.", "If you're an AH for calling your mom ugly, she's an AH for each individual time she's made YOU feel that way. You're NTA, dear, and your mom's treatment of you is not okay.\n\nAlso, if your thinner sister can fit dresses that were bought for you, i wonder if you're really as fat as your mom has made you feel. \n\nEither way, now is your chance to experiment! Figure out what looks great and what looks silly, and rejoice in even the silly stuff because it helps inform your personal style.", "NTA. She probably thinks she\u2019s ugly herself, and that\u2019s why she projecting that insecurity on to you. She\u2019s the one dissing you all this time, and can\u2019t even take one insult back.", "So she made you cry and then called you ugly for crying? Typical bully behaviour. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is emotionally abusive. She was never helping you, she is only hurting you. Her issues with food and bodies should not be yours to carry. \n\nTake control of your wardrobe. One of the best ways to feel good about yourself is to wear things you like and feel good in. Delight in wearing things that piss her off. Because she\u2019s wrong and if she\u2019s mad it\u2019s because you\u2019re doing something right by taking her control over you away. \n\nBe careful with the weight loss, ok? Talk to your doctor. Make sure you\u2019re being safe and not wandering into dangerous ED territory. Eating disorders are among the most fatal mental illnesses.", "Hi. Like everyone else said, NTA.\n\nBut I want to tell you a few important things I wish someone had told me when I was a teenager. \n\nWear the dresses that make you feel good. You deserve to feel pretty. You deserve to enjoy your clothes and your body, even if it doesn't look like what your mom thinks it should. \n\nFeeling good about your body won't make you fat. It doesn't make you immoral, or slutty or whatever horrible thing your mom told you. \n\nIn fact, when people feel good about their bodies, they are more likely to make healthy choices (exercise, healthy food, etc). Self hatred will get you nowhere other than a eating disorder. \n\nPut on your dresses. Put on makeup if it's something you think you'll enjoy, do something fun with your hair. \n\nTry, as best as you can, to ignore your mom. Focus on the little things that bring you pleasure and make you enjoy your own body. It could be make up, dancing, massages, bubble baths, running, anything that involves your body feeling good about itself. Don't worry if it doesn't come naturally.  Explore and have fun with it. Try different things and styles and see how you feel! \n\nIt's YOUR body. You will have the rest of your life in it. You are allowed to make decisions about it. You are allowed to like yourself.", "NTA. What your mom was telling you was very unhealthy for you mentally. Wear what you like and what you are comfortable with. Find a weight loss method that works for you. Ignore what she tries to shame you with. If you don't have any health problems stemming from your weight then take things at your own pace. Get to the size that you feel you are comfortable.\n\nDo not let someone else dictate what you look like.", "OP, I need to call out a few things here. This is abuse. 100%. What your mom is doing to you is NOT okay. Any of it. Whether it is deliberately mocking your attire, purchasing all of your clothes, or refusing to allow you to wear certain items and even gifting dresses you were given to your younger sister! Absolutely NONE of that is okay hun. I cannot express how ashamed I am of how your mother is treating you and how my heart breaks for you having to endure it. She is very clearly projecting onto you and doing severe harm. Please know that her words are NOT TRUE. I don\u2019t even have to see you to know this. And stand your ground- those are your gifts, meant for you, and you can wear absolutely anything you choose!!", "NTA. Your mother is a bully. Bullies are only defeated when you confront them.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Definitely NTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s the adult and should know better. She sounds toxic. I feel for you. But if she\u2019s taking a step back it could be good for you. Get fashion feedback from your friends or a relative other than your mother. Hang in there and know that kindness knows no body size.", "NTA! For starters congratulations on losing the 10 lbs! Second, if you want to lose weight, it's all about watching what you eat.\n\nI'm disabled and exercise is not easy for me at all. I got an app to help me count calories and track them and I've lost about 75 lb so far. Now let me be clear this has taken a few years to lose that 75 lb because I'm trying to go about it in a way that's healthy and not a crash diet. So it's a very slow process and it's also really important for me to work on my mental health because weight loss and diet. It's not just a physical thing. It's also a mental thing. And there's so much more that goes into it than just losing the weight.\n\nAnyways, your mom is horrible and you should wear what you feel best in. Your mom has no right to be criticizing you. Honestly, she sounds like a narcissist. She might be jealous of your accomplishments and is trying to take you down a peg. That would definitely fall in line with a narcissists behavior.\n\nLastly, congratulations on the award!!", "NTA. OP, please be careful about dieting. I don't think dieting is good for minors at all, but even for adults most weight loss diets are horrible for your health. You lose weight for a short time, but your body will think you are slowly starving and make you feel hungrier while also slowing down your metabolism and you end up gaining more weight with bonus damage to your heart.\n\nI'm afraid your mother is about to send you right into an eating disorder and that will screw up your health forever, even once you manage to get out of disordered eating.\n\nPlease please speak to your school nurse. If you listen to podcasts, iWeigh podcast by Jameela Jamil might be useful to you, as she has gone through an eating disorder and talks about how it's impacted her along with diet and weight loss culture in general and how it can be so harmful and talks about health without linking it to diet culture and weight.", "NTA. Your mother plays favourites and she has body issues that she is projecting on you. A, she has no place to give away your dresses. B, she has no reason to compare you to your sister. C, you\u2019re old enough to dress yourself! A kid is not an accessory or a dress up doll.    \n\n\nAlso, 5\u20194/170 is not huge. You\u2019ll have your weight where you want it in no time.

N.T.A.", "NTA. \nholy shit, your mom is terrible. my parents and siblings do the same to me but i learned that mirroring the behaviors of a shitty person will help them see that they\u2019re being a shitty person. that\u2019s what you did and i applaud you for that. idek what you look like, but you are beautiful no matter what. idk what your mom looks like either, but she\u2019s sounding really ugly by the way she\u2019s degrading and emotionally abusing her daughter. don\u2019t think that the word \u201cfat\u201d means ugly btw. yes, you might be bigger than other people (idk what u look like btw), but that doesn\u2019t make you ugly. being fat isn\u2019t a bad thing, especially when it\u2019s a case where you can\u2019t control your weight. \nat the end of the day, you can\u2019t spell beautiful without fat if you think abt it rlly well.\n\nalso, does your sister ever defend you? have you ever talked to her abt it? bc if you haven\u2019t, then you should talk to her about it and see what she thinks about it.\n\nDM me if you need someone to talk to bc i\u2019ve been through the same thing and i wanna help you. <33", "Please do this! \u201cGrandma, I liked the dress you got me but my mom wouldn\u2019t let me wear it and gave it to my sister\u201d.

It's likely her mother may have already gotten to her. :/", "You shouldn\u2019t wear things because they might \u201clook good\u201d to other people, only things that make you feel good yourself!

Besides, what \u201clooks good\u201d is 100% subjective.", "Considering the power imbalance, I\u2019m not sure this is possible.
