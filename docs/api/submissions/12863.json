Now he\u2019s saying if that\u2019s the case he\u2019s never driving my truck again for any reason (I\u2019m 32 weeks pregnant, so sometimes I ask him to drive because I\u2019m tired). We have a family trip coming up so that basically means I\u2019m expected to drive the whole way there and back by myself, since my truck is the only one that can fit all of us.

Now he\u2019s saying if that\u2019s the case he\u2019s never driving my truck again for any reason\n\nNTA. This is manipulative and immature. So is his refusal to expect his friends to behave like responsible adults and clean up after themselves. \n\n>We have a family trip coming up so that basically means I\u2019m expected to drive the whole way there and back by myself,\n\nTell him that if he's going to behave in such an immature manner, you're not going to entertain that behavior. Don't go. \n\nThe solution is very clear. If he wants to use the truck, he needs to respect the fact that it's your truck and you expect him to return it to you in the same condition it was in when he took it. This is not an unreasonable request. If he thinks it is, borrow one of his tools and return it to him with food stuck to it. I guarantee you that he understands the concept. He just doesn't care because he doesn't want to clean up his and his friend's mess. He wants you to do it.", "NTA and your husband sounds like a fucking child.", "NTA - You have a legitimate reason for not wanting him to drive his friends in your truck. It concerns me that instead of addressing your concern he instead tried to get you to pay for a rental (doesn't he have a vehicle and a job?) Also, the fact that he then decided to punish you by saying he'll never drive again, when you're fatigued and pregnant.\n\nWhat is going on with him? Does he often try to punish you when he doesn't get his way?", "NTA.\n\nYou said you just got this 6 seat truck.  How did they plan to go on the trip prior to you getting the truck?  They should stick with whatever transportation they'd planned to use prior to you purchasing the truck.\n\nOr maybe switch off and have one of the other guys provide transportation or have them go in together to rent a vehicle since your husband has driven his previously for their trips \n\nI was going to suggest you compromise and allow him to drive it,.if he would agree to have it washed, detailed, & filled with gas BEFORE returning it to you.  But i know he would agree to that so he could drive on trip, but most likely not follow thru because he would be \"too tired from the trip\". If he cared about vehicles being clean, he would clean his own vehicle .after these trips.\n\nIf he doesn't plan to ever drive it in the future,.so be it, but if that means all the driving falls to you on long trips, then dont go on long trips, or refuse to go unless he splits the driving with you.\n\nHis response was very vindictive and childish and i hope he matures before you give birth to your child.  Dealing with him sounds like dealing with a child.", ">I won\u2019t let him drive my truck, I should pay for them to take a rental.\n\nWait, wtf??\n\nWhat is wrong with his own truck? Are your finances shared?", "NTA and his reaction is very concerning. Especially since you are having a baby with him.\n\nIs he like this in other situations?", "You are NTA. You should buy your husband a car seat, since children are required to be in one.\n\nIf he wants a fancy new vehicle to trash with his buds on his road trip, let him rent one. If he doesn\u2019t want to drive on an upcoming family trip, either cancel it or leave his ass home. He doesn\u2019t get to mess up your shit since he\u2019s the slob who has slob friends.", "NTA. If he is a pig while driving and his friends too i understand your reaction. What i don't understand is his reaction. He is litteraly asking you to hand your truck, or else.. That's not good at all.", "NTA and he comes off like a kid in a tantrum. \nNot sure what the ages are here, but it sounds like you married a teenager.", "nta. You just bought a brand new truck, your husband should be understanding that you don't want it getting all dirtied up so soon. And asking you to pay for a rental is ridiculous. And for him to say he won't drive it again, knowing you're giving birth soon and causing you unneeded stress makes him a HUGE ah. You guys need some counseling.", "NTA he has his own truck? So why", "NTA your husband should not resort to blackmail when he can't get his own way.", "NTA - but god is he? Can he makes his friends clean up after themselves? Is that not an option.", "NTA. \n\nHis reaction is concerning. Almost as if he wants to show off and pretend it\u2019s his new toy.", "NTA\n\nHe has shown time and time again that there is zero consideration for keeping his truck tidy. You know how he is and really do not want to \"soil\" a new truck. Not to mention he can use his truck??? But asking for you to pay a rental (which wouldn't it also in theory be him paying too) is kinda a slap in the face.", "NTA.  He has a vehicle, why does he need to borrow yours?  Also, 8 hour road trip would diminish the \u201cnew\u201d.  If he wants a rental, let his buddies chip in.", "NTA, but I do have a question here too. You said \u201cI bought a truck\u201d - was he involved in this purchase too? What\u2019s with his entitlement?", "NTA but what was the plan before you bought the truck?", "\u201cWe have a family trip coming up so that basically means I\u2019m expected to drive the whole way\u2026since my truck is the only one that can fit all of us.\u201d\n\nInfo needed: who is \u201call\u201d of you? And where are you going? It sounds like your husband is trying to blackmail you. Can you take this power away? Cancel the family trip, or tell your husband if he\u2019s not driving, he\u2019s not going in your car at all? \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but I doubt your husband will ever see it that way. He sounds very immature and self centered.", "Holy crap......\n\nOkay one NTA, and two why are you with him?\n\nHe's literally trying to blackmail you into letting him use, and abuse your property, by threatening not to help his pregnant partner in your third trimester? Run! Run, and do not look back! \n\nThis kind of crap will only get worse after baby gets here, and you do not need that kind of manipulation, and gaslighting in yours or your baby's life. He clearly doesn't respect you, doesn't respect your property, and is more than willing to stoop to abusive tactics in order to try to manipulate you into capitulating to his demands. \n\nI mean I can't tell you what to do, but I'd be running for the hills.", "NTA and malicious compliance time :D\n\nIf it is a \"family\" trip that you are doing the driving for - driver gets to set the agenda - so driver for as long as you feel comfortable - then pitstop/over night stop. it that means driving 1 hour then stopping for the day; if that means stopping every 30 minutes for a 5 minute break - enforce it.  It also means you have control over the music and where you stop.\n\nOr you cancel the family trip because you are too pregnant.", "\u201cThey leave his truck super dirty every-time they\u2019re in it.\u201d\n\nI N F O: does he still have said truck?\n\nNTA either way, I\u2019m just trying to determine exactly how big of an AH your husband is being.", "NTA. But he\u2019s a big one. He\u2019s acting like a spoiled child because he can\u2019t play with the new toy. It\u2019s your brand new truck, and you have a very valid reason why you don\u2019t want him and his buddies to use it. If his truck has an oil leak, you should offer to take it to the shop to get it looked at. See how he reacts. If he wants to rent a car for the trip, he can pay for it. Don\u2019t let him bully you, and also maybe think about marriage counseling? This seems like a red flag to me.", "Don\u2019t let him blackmail you. Take him up on the offer if not driving, play for deliveries out of your joint account.  A family trip, driving on the road for hours while heavily pregnant; does not sound fun.
