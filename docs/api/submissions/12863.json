Now he\u2019s saying if that\u2019s the case he\u2019s never driving my truck again for any reason\n\nNTA. This is manipulative and immature. So is his refusal to expect his friends to behave like responsible adults and clean up after themselves. \n\n>We have a family trip coming up so that basically means I\u2019m expected to drive the whole way there and back by myself,\n\nTell him that if he's going to behave in such an immature manner, you're not going to reward it. Don't go. \n\nThe solution is very clear. If he wants to use the truck, he needs to respect the fact that it's your truck and you expect him to return it to you in the same condition it was in when he took it. This is not an unreasonable request. If he thinks it is, borrow one of his tools and return it to him with food stuck to it. I guarantee you that he understands the concept. He just doesn't care because he doesn't want to clean up his and his friend's mess. He wants you to do it.", "NTA and your husband sounds like a fucking child.", "NTA - You have a legitimate reason for not wanting him to drive his friends in your truck. It concerns me that instead of addressing your concern he instead tried to get you to pay for a rental (doesn't he have a vehicle and a job?) Also, the fact that he then decided to punish you by saying he'll never drive again, when you're fatigued and pregnant.\n\nWhat is going on with him? Does he often try to punish you when he doesn't get his way?", "NTA.\n\nYou said you just got this 6 seat truck.  How did they plan to go on the trip prior to you getting the truck?  They should stick with whatever transportation they'd planned to use prior to you purchasing the truck.\n\nOr maybe switch off and have one of the other guys provide transportation or have them go in together to rent a vehicle since your husband has driven his previously for their trips \n\nI was going to suggest you compromise and allow him to drive it,.if he would agree to have it washed, detailed, & filled with gas BEFORE returning it to you.  But i know he would agree to that so he could drive on trip, but most likely not follow thru because he would be \"too tired from the trip\". If he cared about vehicles being clean, he would clean his own vehicle .after these trips.\n\nIf he doesn't plan to ever drive it in the future,.so be it, but if that means all the driving falls to you on long trips, then dont go on long trips, or refuse to go unless he splits the driving with you.\n\nHis response was very vindictive and childish and i hope he matures before you give birth to your child.  Dealing with him sounds like dealing with a child.", ">I won\u2019t let him drive my truck, I should pay for them to take a rental.\n\nWait, wtf??\n\nWhat is wrong with his own truck? Are your finances shared?", "NTA and his reaction is very concerning. Especially since you are having a baby with him.\n\nIs he like this in other situations?", "You are NTA. You should buy your husband a car seat, since children are required to be in one.\n\nIf he wants a fancy new vehicle to trash with his buds on his road trip, let him rent one.

You just bought a brand new truck, your husband should be understanding that you don't want it getting all dirtied up so soon. And asking you to pay for a rental is ridiculous. And for him to say he won't drive it again, knowing you're giving birth soon and causing you unneeded stress makes him a HUGE ah. You guys need some counseling.", "NTA he has his own truck? So why", "NTA your husband should not resort to blackmail when he can't get his own way.", "NTA - but god is he? Can he makes his friends clean up after themselves?

Almost as if he wants to show off and pretend it\u2019s his new toy.", "NTA\n\nHe has shown time and time again that there is zero consideration for keeping his truck tidy.

He sounds very immature and self centered.", "Holy crap......\n\nOkay one NTA, and two why are you with him?\n\nHe's literally trying to blackmail you into letting him use, and abuse your property, by threatening not to help his pregnant partner in your third trimester? Run! Run, and do not look back! \n\nThis kind of crap will only get worse after baby gets here, and you do not need that kind of manipulation, and gaslighting in yours or your baby's life. He clearly doesn't respect you, doesn't respect your property, and is more than willing to stoop to abusive tactics in order to try to manipulate you into capitulating to his demands. \n\nI mean I can't tell you what to do, but I'd be running for the hills.", "NTA and malicious compliance time :D\n\nIf it is a \"family\" trip that you are doing the driving for - driver gets to set the agenda - so driver for as long as you feel comfortable - then pitstop/over night stop. it that means driving 1 hour then stopping for the day; if that means stopping every 30 minutes for a 5 minute break - enforce it.  It also means you have control over the music and where you stop.\n\nOr you cancel the family trip because you are too pregnant.", "\u201cThey leave his truck super dirty every-time they\u2019re in it.\u201d\n\nI N F O: does he still have said truck?\n\nNTA either way, I\u2019m just trying to determine exactly how big of an AH your husband is being.", "NTA.

If his truck has an oil leak, you should offer to take it to the shop to get it looked at. See how he reacts. If he wants to rent a car for the trip, he can pay for it.

Aren't you two married? Isn't it both of your money? I'm confused.", "NTA OP Your truck your rules. Does your husband have any endearing qualities that would justify you staying with a controlling, selfish prick?", "NTA\n\nis he going to keep throwing tantrums when you have the baby?", "NTA. And husband already has his own truck. He and his friends can trash up that one.", ">So then he says since I won\u2019t let him drive my truck, I should pay for them to take a rental\n\nHuh???\n\nAm i missing something?\n\nWhy THE FUCK would YOU have to pay for a rental?\n\n>Now he\u2019s saying if that\u2019s the case he\u2019s never driving my truck again for any reason \n\nDid you marry a 10 year old? FUCKING HELL.\n\nTell him to buy his own damn truck and use it to move out.\n\nGood luck with the baby, and your soon to be born child too.\n\nNTA and think about the future of your relationship because THIS is not normal.", "NTA your husband sounds super manipulative with his little blackmail tantrum.

WTF! \nYah, husband is a huge childish asshole. \nMight want to take a good long look at your marriage and re-evaluate.", "Pregnant *with his child* (I presume)", "I\u2019m pretty sure you can\u2019t return most rentals in a mess can you? Or if you do they charge extra.", "Oh, good point. If his truck isn\u2019t reliable, he shouldn\u2019t leave someone who\u2019s 8 mo pregnant to deal with it.", "this is their second child, OP pays 90% of child expenses", "I would call around and get the price of a complete detail\n Tell him you want the money up front in cash", "I think it's because a) he won't clean the truck or make his friends do it and b) he is responding like a literal child would by refusing to ever drive again. Both very pathetic", "Christ it's their second child, no shared finances, and she covers about 90% of child costs.\n\n$20 this guy spends more time with his friends than being a father. After all, prioritizing his friends over his soon to be child...\n\n> This is our 2nd child together. I usually pay for the things the kids need. If I don\u2019t have it he has no problem getting it . But 90% of the time it\u2019s me.", "I agree. This guys a real piece of work.", "info:\n\nwho does the housework?  \n\nwho takes care of the baby?", "pays extremely minimal child support", "and now we can meditate on this wisdom", "You're married.

I think you need to lay it down on the line to your husband.  Tell him his behavior is completely unnaceptable and either he straightens out and acts like a responsible adult and partner or you are leaving.  I hope you can really do that (leave I mean, there are good guys out there).   Maybe counseling, but from everything you said it doesn't sound like he even does much for you besides \"I love him\" and 10% of baby costs.  I mean ... why do you love him?   He doesn't even sound nice to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe sounds emotinally abusive and trying to logic with him won't work (If it did we wouldn;t be here).  You have to tell him he is full of BS nad stop acting like an asshole.  No more logical arguments.", "Why doesn\u2019t he have his own truck? Does husband not have his own finances?", "His trip his friends why u should pay ?\n\nAnd not concerned for your pregnancy\n\nHe needs couple counseling\nNTA", "NTA You could tell him if he didn't drive to see family, he doesn't go in the trip. I really feel for you.  Good luck.", "NTA I'm sorry your eldest child is behaving so badly. Feeling annoyed that your partner is setting boundaries is understandable, but being petty about it, isn't. Are there any other red flags he's waving?", "NTA I'm sorry is this your adult husband - or your teenage son???", "Like a 2 year old mad on the playground that you won't let him and his friends play with your truck. He's trying to manipulate you. Stand your ground. If he's like that with a truck what will he be like with the baby?

What does he bring to the relationship other than childish tantrums?", "Or a shaver", "ohmmmmmmmmmmm"]}
