Accidents happen.  If you're malicious, or reckless, then yeah maybe you have some responsibility, but it sounds like  a basic accident caused mostly by your friend's positioning of the desk and laptop.  I think your friend just wants a free laptop on your dime.", "Nta. He was negligent by placing the laptop where it could fall easily. An attempt to get a free laptop. It's BS.", "The two of you splitting the cost of a repair would be the most reasonable solution", "ESH.  You admit to breaking the laptop and while you may not have intended to do so you still have some negligence.  Try offering to pay half the repair costs.  He has no reason to expect a new laptop from you.", "ESH.  You broke it, but if there's a place willing to fix it then he should accept the offer.  I'd say it would be fair for you to say you'd pay as much as the repair place is charging but if he wants a new one he has to cover the difference", "NTA   \nDon't tell people you broke it. The fall to the floor broke it. Your friend is responsible for putting it somewhere it shouldn't have been. He is completely responsible for not taking care of his laptop. And if for some reason it ends up that you forced to pay the full price for it, demand the old one so that he doesn't get to keep it and fix it for next to nothing and end up with two working laptops for the price of one. If you're replacing it then you're entitled to the old one.", "you admit to breaking it, but simply don\u2019t want to pay for it? laptops are a common practice in a lot of schools these days, if you\u2019re admitting you broke it (even by accident) yta for refusing to pay for it or even help pay for it. if you think the place can actually fix his laptop offer to bring it in, but if they can\u2019t fix it you usually still have to pay for time + labor, so it could end up costing more.", "Violated my space waaah.", "I feel like there is something odd about this story. Like I feel the \u201clightly tapped my friends laptop that was precariously positioned near the edge of his desk in my space.\u201d Seems like a lie to convince everyone you aren\u2019t TA. Tbh idk, just this story seems off.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not your fault that he put his desk way too close to you and left his laptop on the edge.\n\nIf he set it on the floor next to your feet and you accidently stepped on it when you stood up, would he think that was your fault too?\n\nHonestly you aren't responsible in any way, but offering to pay for half of the repair was nice. Then this fool says no, he wants full original price? \n\nnah, that aint happening", "YTA. you\u2019re even admitting you broke it in here. \n\nIf it can go to a repair shop or brand new is fine but either way you should be paying for it.", "YTA, if you were being MINDFUL of your space, then you wouldn\u2019t have broken his laptop. He had a right to choose where to sit. If you value your friendship then offer to pay for half the repairs at the very least.", "YTA, you owe him.  You should've looked where you were going.\n\nYour \"right to personal space\" isn't a thing, bucko.", "You weren\u2019t negligent. He was by moving his desk. NTA", "I go with YTA for saying it is all his fault", "Oh he was asking for it. NTA at all", "YTA. \n\nUnless you can prove he intentionally placed his laptop at the edge of his desk for you to knock it down, you could be held liable for breaking the laptop even if it was not intentional. It is the same concept as if someone parked their car too close to you, and you hit it, you would still be held liable for damages to their vehicle. You also cannot argue when getting into the accident by saying \u201cyou knew the risks of getting into an accident when you are driving\u201d in order to displace fault. Therefore, your \u201cpersonal space\u201d or \u201cknowing the risks of bringing expensive items to school\u201d argument can be defeated easily. \n\nIf this case goes to small claims (although unlikely), your odds aren\u2019t too great. Even if the court agrees that he was too close, you would still be found partially liable.\n\nJust offer to pay for the repairs. You don\u2019t need to replace the whole laptop if that\u2019s not necessary. You would only be responsible to pay for repairs unless he can find expert witnesses to testify that replacement is absolutely necessary.\n\nKeep in mind this answer is written without knowing how close your friend was actually sitting. If he was sitting unreasonably close, then I could see why he would be liable.", "NTA. It's obvious that he's just trying to make a quick buck. Y W B T A if you don't at least offer to help buy the replacement parts (as this is still partially your fault), but right now you're not. And it's also his fault for placing the laptop the way he did. Also, any laptop that breaks completely after falling once probably needs to be replaced anyways.", "NTA it really doesn\u2019t matter that he moved his desk into your personal space. It was an accident and you didn\u2019t do anything on purpose. Now to keep the friendship you might want to see what you can do to help out but buying him a new laptop is a little much.", "The desks are where they are to prevent things like this. Your \"friend\" moved his, he brought his laptop, he did not place it safely, this is on him. \n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
