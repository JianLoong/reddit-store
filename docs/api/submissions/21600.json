But he didn't marry her until after you guys divorced.\n\nThat story is so ridiculous. If I were you I posted on your Facebook. \n\nBecause if your ex is so stupid to give you money that was intended for his next wife's daughter, Then he deserves to lose that money.\n\nI get the idea of wanting peace and being willing to pay for it. But giving these two entitled women money will not make them go away. It will encourage them and you will be harassed for the rest of your life.\n\nI would post on social media this:\n\nMy ex and I are divorced. Everything that he's entitled to is with him. Everything I'm entitled to, is with me. Our divorce has been finalized. He did not give me any money for future stepchildren's weddings either during our marriage or after it.

NTA, you don\u2019t owe those crazed gold diggers anything", "NTA. I would ask a lawyer advice on what your legal options are to make the disgusting behavior of the ex's wife and step-daughter stop.

They think your moneys theirs, no amount you give them will ever be enough. It\u2019s also not fair to your daughter. Not to mention if you cave all you\u2019re doing is reinforcing that if they make a big enough scene you\u2019ll give them whatever they want. Their entitlement will only grow further, I wouldn\u2019t even bother talking to your ex. She wouldn\u2019t feel this bold if he hasn\u2019t lied to her about your past finances to try to make himself look better. Document, keep the cops notified, file for defamation, and raise your security in your home. Someone so unhinged that even police intervention isn\u2019t shutting them down is some actually dangerous. Keep a close eye on your daughter as well, step sister obviously fell from the same tree and could be just as dangerous to her. It\u2019s time to wake up and take this seriously, that your even questioning you self is a testament to how much they\u2019re harassing/gaslighting you into questioning yourself and a testament to your big heart. Don\u2019t do you and your daughter the disservice to allow this any longer. If you want have a copy and paste message to send anyone making accusations with a short explanation of everything, screenshot the message, then block them. Having family and friends reach out to harass could be breaking her restraining order or will in the future.\n\nEdit: there\u2019s even the possibility that she knows it\u2019s really your money, but her jealousy triggered something in her at the wedding.

Block the entire family on all social media and phones", "NTA. Have you thought about changing banks?", "Wait, so your husbands new wife is saying his daughter is too ugly to get married and his daughter\u2019s money should go to her child instead. \n\nHow is he responding to this exactly?", "I can ALMOST see the new wife's point. It's a STUPID point, mind you, but I can see where her mind went.\n\n- OP and Ex were married. \n\n- They established a fund \"together\". It was OP'S money, but \"what's yours is mine and what's mine is mine,\" right? Obviously, it only applies in one direction.\n\n- They divorced. \n\n- Ex should get half of fund or have equal say in its use since he's not getting alimony. \n\n- Ex would obviously want to use his portion/say in the fund for his stepdaughter, because fuck his other kid, am I right? (Who wants to bet that OP's bio-daughter looks like her, which is why the new wife has a problem with her and not the son?)\n\n- New Wife's daughter is prettier/is her daughter and so deserves more, especially since OP can just earn the money back later.\n\n- The obvious conclusion is that OP is a big meanie in not surrendering her fund as \"easily\" as she surrendered her ex. This is an inconvenience to new wife.\n\n- Ex just wants to make new wife happy so that she calms ALL the way the fuck down, and OP is making that really hard by not letting her commit fraud."]}
