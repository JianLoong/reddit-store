We had a very loving and caring marriage. He had brought a little boy into the marriage from a pass relationship. I\u2019ve accepted him as my own. It wasn\u2019t until both of the kids were 17, they are 4 months apart, that we divorced. It was a mutual agreement. \n\nI know there\u2019s going to be questions about the ages of the kids, the ex, they was trying to have a kid so they went with IVF. They ended up divorcing and she won what you would call custody over the embryos. She had the embryos implanted right around the time we started trying for a kid. I was due 2 months before her but ended up having her early due to complications. \n\nMy step-son, considers me to still be his bonus mom and just calls the wife by her name. I had put a collage fund and wedding fund away for both of them. Well he ended up getting married this pass April. The wife\u2019s daughter is engaged and kept going on about how beautiful and it\u2019s everything she wants for her wedding. It was a beautiful wedding and he included me in the mother and son dance along with his bio mom. The now wife was so mad by this and caused a scene. Calling me very vial and gross names. My step-son had her taken out of the venue due to her actions. \n\nMy now ex husband and his wife aren\u2019t as well off since the divorce. I was and always been the breadwinner. She had came to asking me to give them half or all of my daughters wedding fund so her daughter could have it. Calling my daughter ugly and no man would want to marry her anyway. She also said it was her husband\u2019s money anyway, it wasn\u2019t, and she is the rightful owner of it now that she\u2019s the wife. I ended up blowing up and going off. I told her to get off my yard and I will be filling a restraining order, to scare her. \n\nSince the interaction with her, her family had been contacting me and telling me I\u2019m being selfish with HER HUSBAND\u2019S MONEY. I\u2019ve been even receiving notifications that she\u2019s trying to access the money via my bank accounts. I get calls almost everyday now that she\u2019s going into the bank claiming she has rights to the money. I\u2019ve called cops and reported it. She\u2019s still very unhinged. She was arrested the last attempted then told her daughter that my ex husband put her wedding fund in my account and I\u2019m withholding it from her. The daughter had been contacting me, going off, slandering me on Facebook, yelling I stole her money, and has file charges. The case came and went, she lost and is still trying to claim money is in fact hers. She\u2019s still on Facebook yelling that I stole her money.

Both she and her daughter sound like horrible people and they deserve absolutely nothing from you. Your ex should also have put a stop to this. Their behavior is criminal.", "Your stories a little confusing, but I'm assuming that the wife is your ex's third wife. He married your stepsons mother, then you, and now her. \n\nAnd the daughter is his stepdaughter. \n\nSo his wife is saying that he put money in your account for his stepdaughter... But he didn't marry her until after you guys divorced.\n\nThat story is so ridiculous. If I were you I posted on your Facebook. \n\nBecause if your ex is so stupid to give you money that was intended for his next wife's daughter, Then he deserves to lose that money.\n\nI get the idea of wanting peace and being willing to pay for it. But giving these two entitled women money will not make them go away. It will encourage them and you will be harassed for the rest of your life.\n\nI would post on social media this:\n\nMy ex and I are divorced. Everything that he's entitled to is with him. Everything I'm entitled to, is with me. Our divorce has been finalized. He did not give me any money for future stepchildren's weddings either during our marriage or after it. And the idea that he would is so ludicrous. I can't believe I'm having to respond on social media. \n\nNTA", "Did he marry her since you two divorced? Not that it matters at all. NTA. \n\n100% get the law involved here. The money is yours, the step-daughter is not. Get a new phone/phone number and put your old one in a drawer so you still have recent messages to document. Move banks. How the hell is she able to get close enough to even attempt to access your funds?", "NTA", "Gather this evidence everywhere and get the police involved. NTA, you don\u2019t owe those crazed gold diggers anything", "NTA. I would ask a lawyer advice on what your legal options are to make the disgusting behavior of the ex's wife and step-daughter stop. Giving in would only mean the start of having to deal with even more entitled behavior (like setting up a college fund for the future children of the ex's step-daughter).", "NTA\n\nThey are trying to steal from you. Defending yourself is far from being an AH!\n\nIn fact, seeing how they are publicly spreading lies about you, you could sue them for it, since it is affecting your reputation.", "NTA. They are not entitled to money you put away. Document everything and involve the police as necessary.", "Money is the root of all evil. Another example here. You\u2019re obviously NTA, I feel you know this already. \n\nMaybe if this woman\u2019s kid had been respectful and have a convo with you, donating would have been a nice thing to do. However, it sounds like no attempt was given to have a convo (prob bc the mom is a psycho) and I don\u2019t know how you could feel guilty lol. \n\nWhere does your ex husband stand with this? Surely he isn\u2019t instigating saying it\u2019s his money too?", "NTA. Your ex-husband's wife is clearly behaving inappropriately and crossing boundaries. She has no right to demand or access your daughter's wedding fund. It's your daughter's money, and you have every right to protect it. Donating the money is a personal choice, but it doesn't make you an asshole for not doing so. It's important to prioritize your daughter's future and well-being over baseless demands from someone who is harassing you.", "NTA  \n\n\nAnd I would have sued on the defamantion alone, let alone the harrasment", "NTA - You have handled things better than I . Even if you gave them money for a person you have no relationship so they would go away and would stop inviting you to their craziness  when / where would it stop? They would just keep coming after you for every cent they feel entitled to.", "NTA. Your ex husband's step daughter has nothing to do with you. For some ungodly reason his current wife thinks the money is his and she and her daughter are entitled to it. Kind of makes me wonder who put that idea in her head... OP's ex husband? Maybe not though, since it sounds like his new wife is an entitled AH throwing a fit that she wasn't included in the mother son dance even though it sounds like she would have come into your ex husband's son's life when he was an adult.. he doesn't owe her anything either.", "restraining order, stat.", "NTA, talk to a lawyer about suing for harassment, libel/slander. If they lost in court they know it's a lie to keep making the claim.", "And don't give a single dollar or it will never end...", "Holy entitlement batman. I feel bad for OP. Definitely track everything and sue. NTA", "The ex husband is 100% complicit in this.", "Yup! You are correct!", "Who knows \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My bet is the ex lied through his teeth to his new wife", "Even defamation", "Wait so it's not even *his daughter* it's his *stepdaughter* and it's *your* money, not alimony or something (which would still be way over the line)\n\nUh\n\nNot only are you NTA you are *definitely* the victim of a few crimes.", "Wow!  Nope.  NTA.  Her lack of financial planning is not your problem.  Block them all, get no contact orders, switch banks, and be done with them.", "*past, not pass", "Yeah, it seems like he could have nipped this in the bud by just saying he didn't contribute anything.\n\nHowever, even if he did contribute, it's still meant for *your* daughter. Not your' exes new wife's daughter. She needs help!"]}
