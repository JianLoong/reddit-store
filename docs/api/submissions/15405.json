{"id": 15405, "submission_id": "12uq75m", "title": "AITA for refusing to enable my husband sister?", "selftext": "My (29) husband (27) is a stay-at-home dad; he majored in biology, then dropped out of medical school after not wanting to waste his time, so he worked in research for a while. But then we decided that I should be the working parent because I am earning about six figures, which is almost triple what he was earning. He has been a stay-at-home dad, but he also took up baking as a hobby when he was dealing with depression during lockdown, so he sort of has a small baking business. He gets like 3-6 clients a month, or some months he is too busy with the kids to bake. So he normally uses his money to fund his habits and gives his sister money sometimes. He gives her like 20 dollars every day from chipotle money to sephora money. Whenever I warn him, he likes it because it's only $20 and it's lunch money.\n\nRecently, his sister called him for $200; apparently, her heater turned off, and he asked me to send her the money. He hasn't taken up cake orders in awhile because we have 2-year-old triplets and a 4-and-a-half-year-old that have all been getting sick one after the other. I told him no, that she needs to learn to take care of herself. He got upset and then told me that he needed money to buy something on Amazon for himself. I told him no, because I knew he was going to use it for his sister. We do have a joint account, but those expenses are for the kids, and I calculated for gas and their activities, so I will know if he uses them for personal use. I am not gonna lie, we are doing very well financially, so 200 dollars wouldn't have hurt me even with 4 kids, but I feel like his sister(22) is too grown to be asking for money from him every other day. He ended up demanding, with no prior discussion, that he decide on his own that he is going back to work and that I need to start budgeting for childcare. I have tried to have a conversation, and he says that there is nothing I can say to change his mind; he doesn't understand why I have to ask him why he needs money when he rarely asks for it (it is true in some sense that he always uses the money he gets from baking for his personal needs, but I feel like he doesn't take that fact that I paid for the equipment he was using and all the materials he started with when he was in his practicing phase during COVID.) but I just don't want to enable his sister and want to help her manage her money better and start adulting. And I usually do give him money anytime he asks. I just felt like it was a waste in this case.\n\nI feel like him telling me all of a sudden that he doesn\u2019t want to be a SAHD is kind of blindsiding me, and I feel like he is trying to guilt me just because I don't want to enable his sister's bad habits.

And you told him no at times.  This is financial abuse and you are an abuser.  You husband needs to get out from under the yoke of your oppression.", "I am a SAHM. I have just as much (actually more) education than my hubby but I chose to stay at home with my children. If he treated me like you are treating him, I\u2019d be going back to work too. Who died and made you the ruler of the kingdom? I would absolutely go off if he made decisions like you do - YOU F*CKING CALCULATE GAS MILEAGE!!!! You are supposed to be a team. United jointly. You\u2019ve turned this into your financial show and he\u2019s just a side character. Wow. YTA no matter what he has asked money for.", "Yta. I understand not wanting to help.his sister but the fact that the household brings in 6 figures and he doesn't even have 200 personal money is a red flag. Decide on childcare it's better for him to have his own money.", "YTA. Half of your money is his money by the same logic as you saying how he makes the cupcakes but you pay for the supplies. You get to go to work because he's at home taking care of your 4 children under the age of 3. Your sister-in-law doesn't have gas so she probably doesn't have heat, cooking fuel, or hot water. This isn't lunch money. This is her in real trouble and it's important enough to your husband to be able to have full access to the joint funds that he'd rather go back to work and make you pay for daycare than have to beg you for money again. This isn't the time to grand stand about her not adulting right. It's cold outside still.", "YTA - This isn't about his sister. This is about you having complete financial control. You have an arrangement where he is a SAHD and you're the main breadwinner. That in itself is fine. However, if he has something he really wants to do (like help his sister) and you block him from doing that, that will build resentment. You have joint finances and by your own admission this money wouldn't impact you, so you denying him this is you expressing that your opinion is worth more than his. You're meant to be partners. \n\nHe's not blindsiding you, you're denying him since it's 'your money' and not his. It's not a surprise that he would seek more financial freedom.\n\nOn a side note: depending on his sister's circumstances, at 22 not everyone has their stuff together. She might genuinely need a bit of support.", "YTA, you are going to find out how much daycare is and how little you valued him doing it.  He should not have to beg you for money.", "ESH and YTA, how much would it cost you to have a nanny or pay daycare, housework, or the other things he does while you're working? You're using money to control him. He's TA for allowing his sister to take advantage of his generosity. And the sister? You didn't say much, other than he gives her money too frequently, does she work, is she a full-time student, just a free loader, no parental help? \n\nI mean, it's great you make six figures, but it doesn't make you the boss at home. It's supposed to be a partnership. He works at home, and you work out of the home, so it should be both of you making monetary decisions.", "YTA- I hope you can find childcare for 4 kids with the $200 you're saving. I get not enabling others, but he would have $200 to give his sister if he had a job, which he does not because he cares for your kids. \nWhether the equipment and the house and everything is yours he is providing for you more than you can see (childcare is expensive, and not everyone that cares for kids is respectful and mentally sane, please read about the Krim siblings) and, I know I'll get downvoted for this, but if the roles were reversed, there would be an outrage because your husband is \"using his money to financially control a poor SAHM\"\nLastly, you said you can afford it, you are just trying to prove a stupid point, are you saying that you will get in the way of your own kids helping one another when they need? Some people should just not have kids", "YTA but not for the reason you\u2019re wondering\u2026 He\u2019s taking care of your 4 babies. That means your money is his money too. The fact that you don\u2019t see is that why is why YTA. You need to talk about the sister regardless of money. Talk about how you can help her mature and what you\u2019re comfortable offering in general. Like a full on conversation. Clearly y\u2019all have communication issues because his whole \u201cbudget for child care cause I\u2019m getting a job\u201d is his way of saying \u201cI don\u2019t feel appreciated, you are taking my contributions for granted and I\u2019m seriously uncomfortable with the power imbalance in this relationship\u201d you both need to respect each other more and communicate.", "YTA and this is classic financial abuse.\nYour income isn't just your money it's household money. He should be given without asking, fun money to spend of his own that he doesn't have to explain what he's buying. This is just yikes.", "YTA. It sounds like your the one blindsiding and punishing him because it\u2019s your money. He clearly sees that this can be a problem, so he\u2019s going to make his own money. Either be and adult and have a conversation with him to come up with a compromise or deal with him going back to work.", "YTA and financially abusive.", "YTA: he isn\u2019t giving her that much money. $20 here and there isn\u2019t much. $200 isn\u2019t a big ask either. Let him have $200 and then have a discussion about how you want to proceed with his sister moving forward. \n\nIf you are calculating how much gas costs with mileage, you clearly don\u2019t trust him. It is time to see a marriage counselor and try to repair things before things get too bad. Or you are abusive because that is a red flag of financial abuse. It sounds more like a trust issue to me though.", "Wow, I already thought you were an asshole because of how controlling you are about \"your\" money when your husband is doing an equal share in the household and you both agreed on this setup, but comments say husband & husband's sister grew up in foster care. So like, of course a 22 year old with no other family or support might need some financial help here and there. You don't get to judge whether or not she \"treats your husband more like a parent\" UNLESS your husband is expressing that himself. I mean do you respect him or his choices at all? YTA.", "YTA. I don\u2019t disagree with your dislike of giving handouts to your husband\u2019s younger sister, however, the way you control, your husband\u2019s access to money is essentially financial abuse. If he only gets to spend money in ways that you approve of, with no suggestion you ever run your purchases past him, then you\u2019re controlling him with the money that you earn. He has every right to go out and get a job, so he has financial independence from someone who chooses to control his spending.", "YTA.\nHe's your equal, not slave. SAHP may not work in traditional sense, but with triplets and another child, his hands are full. If he has to beg you for money, it's a freaking red flag and a signal you are an abuser.\n\nGo get therapy because your behaviour is not healthy at all. And I am very sorry for your partner, because living with someone that controlling must be q nightmare.", "YTA \n\nWhile I can understand you not wanting to constantly help out his younger sister, it's weird how controlling you are with the money. \n\nI'm appalled that your partner even has to request money from you. Your marriage is a partnership. The stay at home spouse has just as much rights to the joint account as the working partner. \n\nBeing a stay-at-home parent is a round the clock job.  I do hope your partner gets a job so he can have his own funds", "YTA, so he is a SAHD and doesn't get a portion of some money that he can use whatever on his own and everything has to go through you?? I would rather go back to work if I were him because you just want to control him with money.  Since you don't appreciate his contribution of taking care 4 kids, I guess paying for childcare is the only way to go.", "Yta\u2026you admitted that the money he has been spending is from his side job which can\u2019t do much of these days because he\u2019s taking care of 4 kids under 5.  Because it\u2019s your money that you earned your punishing him for wanting to help his sister.  Agreed he should take to his sister about managing her money better.  \n\nYour husband is probably thinking if he were to go back to work, then he\u2019d have finance independence and not have to convince you to give him money.   Think about how much childcare would cost for 4 kids and think about how little money you allow your husband to have from your paycheck for personal spending.  If the tables were turned and he was doing this to you, how would your feel?", "YTA, not because of the money for your SIL, but because you're abusing your husband.  If this was a husband saying these things and you were reading it, you would be losing your mind.  Financial abuse.   I hope you appreciate that the cost of childcare for four children under 5 is going to be enormous!", "If the genders were reversed this would be a no brained. You\u2019re financially abusing your husband. The fact that it\u2019s all YOUR money and he couldn\u2019t even say go to a store and buy himself something he wants because you calculate GAS MILES? That\u2019s ridiculous you\u2019re not his mother", "YTA, for \"allowancing\" your husband. and the money is \"calculated for gas and their activities, so I will know if he uses them for personal use.\"\n\nso....his ONLY money he can gave is from his baking? Are you paying him wages for being the nurse to the sick kids? If his ONLY money is from his baking, then him being a nurse to the kids is taking away from his pay check. so he needs to be compensated.\n\nIf you are going to control the money and give an allowance to your children only, then he absolutely should go back to work. You are financially trapping him.\n\nI would say the same thing if genders were reversed.", "Yta for making him feel like it\u2019s your money.  He\u2019s taking care of triplets and a 4 year old and you are in total control of the finances.  That\u2019s shitty.  \n\nHis sister is 22.  You are an asshole.  100% \n\nGive him his own account with at least $1000 in it that he never has to tell you what it is for and only needs to  move money over.  Tell him how valued he is, how much you appreciate all he does for you and your family.  Tell him you want him to feel like he has autonomy and that of course you trust him to do what he feels is right.  Just because you would not do it does NOT MAKE YOU RIGHT!", "Eh I hesitate but my gut says YTA. you're controlling the finances so he starts working to have his own money. You don't really NEED to ask why. You don't give him money when he DOES ask so he's going to make his own that he can do whatever he wants with.", "YTA. You miss the part where you are financially abusing him. I don't blame him for going back to work.", "Yta", "YTA. What you\u2019re doing is financial abuse. What he\u2019s doing is combatting that. Yikes, your behavior is gross.", "YTA and you are financially abusing your husband. Figure out a babysitter and let him go back to work.", "YTA - and you are financially abusive.", "YTA\n\nWhat you did just then is financial abuse. Your husband is right to want to have his own resources after this.", "YTA. That\u2019s a lot of words for you to say that you are financially abusing your spouse.", "YTA. Marriage means it\u2019s not YOUR money. Add to that the fact that your husband and his sister were in foster care and he had to ask you for money to help his sister with a measly $200 so she could have heat and you come across as mean spirited, selfish and abusively controlling", "YTA\n\nThis whole post reeks of 'I earn the money so it is my money and he has no say in how it gets spent'.\n\nIf he is looking after the children and house, he is working and has a much right to the family money as you do, because if you choose to have one parent be a STAHP that is what that money is. If he wants to spend his portion by helping out his sister then so be it. The fact that >usually do give him money anytime he asks. I just felt like it was a waste in this case. is gross, he shouldn't be having to ask your permission to spend money unless it is for a major purchase.\n\nGood for him for deciding he isn't going to tolerate this any more and choosing to go back to work so he can earn his own money that you can't control.", "ESH - someone posted a great response earlier, which pointed out that there isn't just one issue here, but two. It's unfair to give the husband no control over the finances, in an agreed single income household the family money is the family money, regardless of who earns it; but he's also not good with money and doesn't realise how much he's giving away from the family pot! And the sister probably shouldn't be asking for all this money, although I wonder how much is really her asking for it, and how much is him just offering, because he doesn't get how much he's spending and thinks it's just free money.\n\nIt's up to him whether he gets a job or not, and if he wants to get one then you'll both have to make alternative childcare arrangements. And if he does get a job, then he needs to contribute to the household as a percentage, including paying childcare, and not just give all his money away like I think he thinks he'll be able to do if he gets a job. He has to understand that your outgoings will increase with his employment and he is financially responsible for part of that too. But then his spends are his to spend - if he wants to spend it on buying his sister lunch or makeup rather than something for himself then that's up to him.\n\nI think you both suck here - both you and he have enabled his financial infantilisation. He needs to understand how money and household finances work, and you need to allow him to understand money and how household finances work!", "YTA this is prime financially controlling behavior", "YTA this isn't about his sister. It doesn't matter if he wants to cash it all in to coins and throw it in fountains while he makes wishes. He is your partner and contributes significantly to your household and also usually finds ways to pay for the things he wants. What you are doing is financial abuse. You should seriously consider how you treat your husband before you don't have one anymore.", "You\u2019re financially abusing your husband and now he\u2019s going to get a job so that he can have some money that you don\u2019t control. The fact that you claim to be blindsided by this and didn\u2019t see it coming a mile off is baffling to me - did you really expect him to tolerate this forever?\n\nMaybe having to budget for the cost of childcare for 4 kids will give you some insight into the value of his work as a SAHD and why the household income was never just *your* money.\n\nYTA", "YTA but not for the reason you think. The issue of him giving money to his sister lacks enough background information for me to provide any input. \n\nHowever, he\u2019s a SAHD. That means your money is his money. You contribute to your family financially and he contributes by caring for your children and home. You calculating how much he can spend is financial abuse. \n\nThe best thing to do here is come up with a budget for personal expenses you\u2019re both comfortable with. This would be an agreed upon amount you can each spend on personal expenses monthly (the amount should absolutely be the same for each of you). What he chooses to do with his personal monthly budget is up to him and if he wants to help his sister, that\u2019s his choice. The same would be true for you.", "YTA. Your husband is a stay-at-home dad; he is an equal partner in your household and should have equal access to the family income unless he has proven to be wildly irresponsible (e.g. if he had a gambling addiction). It's not just your money because domestic labour and care work aren't valued by the economy; calculate what a live-in nanny and housekeeper would cost you and that's the minimum income your husband ought to have for all the work he does. You're financially abusing him by making him ask for pocket money, and if you care about your husband and know that he cares about his sister, it's a better plan to all work together to help her become financially independent rather than punish him because you don't approve of his generosity.", "Please reread your post. He's getting a job because you are being unreasonable. That is not him blindsighting you, that's you being controlling of him.\n\nYTA.", "NTA for not wanting to support a grown woman. Also if he goes back to work you both have to budget for childcare, not just you because the kids are both your responsibility.", "YTA. As the SAHD he\u2019s is contributing to your shared finances, providing childcare at least, and does he do more around the house than you? \nYour money singular is your money plural. I\u2019m not saying handing out wads of cash to relatives shouldn\u2019t be a discussion but you\u2019re not treating it as a discussion about shared money. Look into the cost of full time childcare. \n\nI almost wonder if this is a gender-swap post to \u2018prove\u2019 commentators would react differently. But I do think this is an issue that comes up whenever one partner earns the money and the other partner contributes through labour in the house.", "YTA, but one good thing has come out of this, and that is that your husband finally understands how toxic and controlling you are. I hope he goes back to work and divorces you. You're one giant red flag in yourself. Ugh!", "INFO - It sounds like your husband is not an equal in your relationship. Does he get personal money from what you make to do whatever he wants with?", "YTA. If the genders were reversed everyone would be yelling at you calling you a financially abusive asshole. And that's what you are. Your partner is taking care of 4 little kids. Honestly that's an extremely difficult job. You are being extremely controlling with the finances so he wants to go back to work. Sounds like you got what you wanted and don't have to worry about him spending \"your money\". Your marriage won't last unless you change.", "why does your husband have to ask you for money? you - as a couple - decided he should be a sahd. he\u2019s caring for 4 children under the age of 5. an all the time, crazy stressful job. \n\nthe money you make is shared income. it isn\u2019t yours to allocate to him like a child. he shouldn\u2019t have to beg you for money. gross, lady. yta.", "ESH \n\nOk, him giving her money for frivolous shit is maddening. I get that. One of my biggest successes as an adult is to not enable my my parents to enable my sister. \n\nBut you bean counting every dime for gas mileage, etc, is not healthy. \n\nI think you need to see a counselor that specializes in financial issues. And both of you need to pay daycare for the 4 kids that you share.", "I'm going to go with ESH leaning towards y-t-a. I actually agree with you about the sister; she should be supporting herself, but the entire way you talk about \"giving\" money to your husband is gross. The only reason you're able to earn such a good salary is because you have somebody at home taking care of the kids. Because it's their father, he isn't drawing a salary, but that doesn't mean what he does doesn't have worth. You're not \"giving\" him money like you're the benevolent dictator - it is shared money. So the only discretionary money he has comes from his baking business or he has to ask you for it?!? That's not right, and it's not even. You're supposed to be partners. Now, it does suck that he's planning on basically doing the same thing if he gets a job, by saying that you'll be paying the childcare expenses in full, but I can see why he's angry. He also shouldn't be giving his sister money every day, so y'all really need to work this out. The way you're doing your finances doesn't seem supportable long term. It's very much keeping score with each other, and that's not good for anyone", "ESH. You suck bc he should not have to \"ask\" you for money. You guys are married,  it's joint money. He sucks bc he should not be giving his sister $20 everyday for frivolous things like take out etc. I'd sooner give $200 for a heater than $20 daily for take out.", "ESH - y\u2019all need to figure our finances. Sit down and come to an agreement on what you both are allowed monthly for \u201cfun money\u201d. He\u2019s saving both of you the cost of daycare for 4 kids. He shouldn\u2019t have to ask for money every time.\n\nAgree that X amount every month. Put it in own account. He can use if for himself or for his sister. Neither of you judge what the other spends it on. So he can\u2019t ask for extra money but you can\u2019t yell at him if he decides to send it to his sister.", "ESH bordering Y T A . I grew up in a working mom, SAHD household, where my fathers sister was a perpetual mess. My mom HATES my aunt but still acknowledged my dad is the reason she was able to earn what she did and didn\u2019t begrudge my dad providing financial assistance to her when my aunt couldn\u2019t take care of herself. I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re able to afford but\u2014 while you and your husband may need a mediator to work through this issue financially, if this is chump change to you (especially compared to paying for childcare vs your husband rejoining the workforce) it might worth recognizing your husband feels a need to help his sister and that the cost of doing so short term is cheaper than him struggling to rejoin the workforce. \n\nAs an added consideration: imagine one of your children struggling as an adult with no safety net. Would you want them to suffer or would you want their sibling to help?", "NTA, if he wants to send her $200, he can do it with the money he\u2019s been giving her $20 a day with.

Having a set amount that's for you and one that's for him to use on what you want. It doesn't matter how much it is but should be the same. \n\nAs for the sister NTA, because you don't work yo support someone else. His 20 a day is like 7 grand a year free money. Granted, it was hus money to give, but as a married couple, these things need to be discussed. I would of she is having a problem. On a case by case basis help. Ok, she needs heater or for it to be paid. I would say send me the info, and I will pay directly. This way, you know where the money goes. Of him asking to buy something on Amazon os right after you said no, then I would be saying hell no as well knowing where it was going. It's great he wants to help, but just giving over and over is not helping at all. Nor is it a great thing on your relationship. \n\nHe wants yo go back to work. That's great, but I would be saying at that time. Well, then We both put however much into the household acct for bills, daycare, and expenses, and the rest is your guys. Hubby and I did that till I got hurt. I made more, so I put 60 to 70 percent in and he the rest. But told him not to blow the rest(he sucks at managing money). Because vacations would be both our money and not just mine. Because I am not going to bust my butt to let him buy whatever and then pay for his vacation when he could have saved. Harsh, but it's also vice versa. Stay at home or making less does not entitle you to take advantage though most times people are taken advantage of, but it does happen.

I will notify him when I want to make a larger purchase, as he does with me. There is no asking for money because our money is joint money.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nMy (29) husband (27) is a stay-at-home dad; he majored in biology, then dropped out of medical school after not wanting to waste his time, so he worked in research for a while. But then we decided that I should be the working parent because I am earning about six figures, which is almost triple what he was earning. He has been a stay-at-home dad, but he also took up baking as a hobby when he was dealing with depression during lockdown, so he sort of has a small baking business. He gets like 3-6 clients a month, or some months he is too busy with the kids to bake. So he normally uses his money to fund his habits and gives his sister money sometimes. He gives her like 20 dollars every day from chipotle money to sephora money. Whenever I warn him, he likes it because it's only $20 and it's lunch money.\n\nRecently, his sister called him for $200; apparently, her heater turned off, and he asked me to send her the money. He hasn't taken up cake orders in awhile because we have 2-year-old triplets and a 4-and-a-half-year-old that have all been getting sick one after the other. I told him no, that she needs to learn to take care of herself. He got upset and then told me that he needed money to buy something on Amazon for himself. I told him no, because I knew he was going to use it for his sister. We do have a joint account, but those expenses are for the kids, and I calculated for gas and their activities, so I will know if he uses them for personal use. I am not gonna lie, we are doing very well financially, so 200 dollars wouldn't have hurt me even with 4 kids, but I feel like his sister(22) is too grown to be asking for money from him every other day. He ended up demanding, with no prior discussion, that he decide on his own that he is going back to work and that I need to start budgeting for childcare. I have tried to have a conversation, and he says that there is nothing I can say to change his mind; he doesn't understand why I have to ask him why he needs money when he rarely asks for it (it is true in some sense that he always uses the money he gets from baking for his personal needs, but I feel like he doesn't take that fact that I paid for the equipment he was using and all the materials he started with when he was in his practicing phase during COVID.) but I just don't want to enable his sister and want to help her manage her money better and start adulting. And I usually do give him money anytime he asks. I just felt like it was a waste in this case.\n\nI feel like him telling me all of a sudden that he doesn\u2019t want to be a SAHD is kind of blindsiding me, and I feel like he is trying to guilt me just because I don't want to enable his sister's bad habits. But in case I'm missing something, AITA\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You need to pay him an amount into a personal account every month that he can use on what he wants but also investments for retirement etc rather than fun money. Half of your disposable income after household expenses  may be right, or  even minimum wage for the time you are out of the house/working would be a good starting point to help you quantify how much he is saving the family.\n\nHe shouldn\u2019t have to ask you for money at all. Stuff for the kids comes out of the joint account, as do purchases for the household such as food and repairs. \n\nI agree that his sister is relying on him a lot, and as he is in a parental role with her you both need to have a strategy for helping her become an independent well adjusted adult. They were both likely traumatised by their childhoods in foster care, even if the foster home was long term and good. \n\nIf you can afford it then a little short term financial pain for a long term gain of sister being independent may be a good investment - assuming she isn\u2019t at college and doesn\u2019t already have a degree, would a professional certification help her get a raise or better job? Could she qualify as a beautician or something like that which doesn\u2019t involve a massive outlay that you could help her fund? do they both need therapy? \n\nTalk to him about her situation, then meet with her together to find out what her plans are and what could work for her if she isn\u2019t on a trajectory for a decent job already.

He says he wants to go back to work (because he wants to be able to give his sister money whenever he wants, and how much he wants). So let him have what he wants.\n\nI get that the reason your current financial situation is the way it is, is because he is a poor financial manager who can't say no to his sister. I also think he really has no clue what he's asking for, because I suspect he mistakenly thinks he's going to get to use his entire income as discretionary spending. But the current arrangement infantilizes him, and he needs to feel as if he has some control over his finances.\n\nFigure out what your monthly expenses look like: **all** household expenses including mortgage, insurance, taxes, food, gas and auto maintenance, clothes and healthcare for the children, full-time childcare, AND college and retirement savings. Figure out what percentage of that he needs to pay to be fair, based on his expected income -- 33%, or 25%, or whatever is low enough to give him some spending money, but not low enough to give him a massive amount of spending money.\n\nIt's a pretty safe bet that your percentage is going to be higher than the proportion of your salary to his. That's fine, as long as he gets a decent amount of discretionary spending money, but not enough to entirely finance his sister's life.\n\nThen sit down with him and plan what him going back to work will look like. Each of you will put your share of the monthly expenses into a joint household account **every time you get a paycheck** (in other words, if he's getting paid fortnightly, then 14 days' worth of his percentage of expenses comes out of every paycheck), and you (OP) will be paying all the bills from that. Whatever is left is each of yours to spend.\n\nThen tell him that he will absolutely have to be covering his share of the expenses every month without fail, and that you will not be bailing him out if he overspends on something and falls short of what must be paid into the household fund. You will also not be dipping into your discretionary funds when he's used all of his up and wants more.\n\nOnce this all gets put into place and he gets a job, if he starts consistently falling short of his financial responsibilties, then you have a hard decision to make. You can either let him get away with it, or you can tell him that he has to agree to let you handle the finances again, or you will be filing for divorce.\n\nI'm not optimistic that he can learn self-control at this point, but you have to let him try -- and then let him live with the consequences if he fails to meet his responsibilities.", "It isn't YOUR money", "No it is about the abusive and controlling wife.

If he's not getting an allowance, how is this fair? He can't buy stuff for himself, he cant buy private stuff (like if he wants something frivolous he can't just buy it on his own), he can't save his money for his own stuff, he can't help out family... \n\nHe has ZERO financial control, and being 100% reliable on your spouse for this doesn't sound healthy at all. He deserves a fair allowance so he can actually do the things I listed above. Personally I'd feel trapped without a consistent stream of cash going into my account", "OP admitted in comments she exaggerated how much he gives her.\n\nher words not mine LOL.", "He needs a new wife.", "That's the point everyone is missing. OP would be infuriated their wages are being split 3 ways. They need a serious conversation over this 20/day because that's clearly why op is lashing out on this 200 sum.\n\nImagine just losing all that", "But that what work best for us.", "Heck if OP paid her husband even half of what childcare would cost for 4 kids then her husband would never have to ask (beg) her for money again!", "If the alimony and child support are fair she\u2019ll get to be all alone sans her precious money!", "Honestly unless they literally had no money to help out with the sister there is no reason for OP to care. OP seems like she just wants to control everything her husband does", "Yeah that seems low. You forgot to include overtime since mommy dearest seems like the kind of person to also push after work childcare on her husband because \u2018she makes all the money!\u2019", "Child support and hopefully alimony since the poor man gave up his career to take care of the kids and house.", "Heck if he wasn\u2019t keeping up his end of the bargain then OP should be thrilled he\u2019s going back to work! OP can\u2019t devalue her husbands contributions for the family but still expect him to continue to do them for free.", "The reason I don\u2019t completely agree with this is because no one would bat an eye if a SAHP was spending $600 a month buying makeup or things for themselves (if the family could financially afford it) so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to judge OPs husband on choosing to spend $600 of his \u2018fun money\u2019 on his sister as long as it doesn\u2019t negatively impact his family. If OP said that they couldn\u2019t afford to keep giving her SIL money I would agree with you but it sounds like OPs husband really doesn\u2019t buy anything else for himself and this is the only thing he wants to spend money on.", "This is a great response! I think most of the other responses are ignoring the second fact you've stated, that he's not just financially dependant because he doesn't earn very much money, it's also because he's really bad with finances and doesn't understand them. In part because he's never had to - chicken and egg!", "Exactly!!! If he can't have his own money it puts him in a position of being unable to leave if he wanted or needed to", "Well the A depends on the truth behind that number but 20/ day is too much", "But it's clearly not. Otherwise you wouldn't be making this post.", "Clearly not. It\u2019s what works best for *YOU*. It\u2019s sick that he has to ask you for spending money. Your basically financially abusing him", "No that\u2019s what has worked best for YOU. I would hate to be treated like a child and beg for money for personal expenses, no matter what it is. I\u2019d rather go back to work, which it seems like your husband is choosing to do.", "Clearly, it's not working any more", "I mean it worked best for you, but clearly not him.", "Its what works for you, clearly not for your SO", "It would have if tou were more flexible but now I think your hubby would disagree.", "But that's what works best for YOU. Ftfy.", "She is very controlling and abusive with money, and I think her husband is starting to realize the full extent of the financial abuse. He has a good solution to it though, starting to work again to be able to have his own income and prepare for the worst.", ">no one would bat an eye if a SAHP was spending $600 a month buying makeup or things for themselves (if the family could financially afford it)\n\nSpeak for yourself.\n\nWhen there are 4 kids -- and the massive expense for food, clothing, healthcare, other supplies, and savings involved -- that's a lot of discretionary spending going out the door. If I were in OP's position, neither I nor my partner would be spending that sort of money on luxuries without some questions being asked. $1200 ($600 x 2 people) is at least a whole other mortgage payment.", "I suspect that the current arrangement came about because he repeatedly demonstrated financial irresponsibility.\n\nBut it's not a sustainable arrangement, if he's not willing to recognize that. He feels mistreated. He does deserve the right to have some control of his finances, even if that results in him losing his marriage -- and possibly custody of his kids, if he can't provide for them half the time.\n\nCompulsive irresponsible spending is just another form of substance abuse. OP is living with an addict. This is something that should have been recognized and resolved *before* marriage and kids.", "Happy Cake Day! \ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf70", "I feel like you didn\u2019t read or just ignored the second half of my statement, \u2018if the family could financially afford it\u2019. Heck I even went on to say I would have agreed with OP if they genuinely couldn\u2019t afford it. Unfortunately OP even said herself that they could comfortably afford it and so this isn\u2019t the case of not having enough discretionary money but more of the case of OP believing she deserves to pick how the money is spent because she is the one making it (completely discrediting her husbands contributions to allow her to make money) which really sounds like financial abuse to me.", "Totally agree! It's a shame it's got to this stage, really, it may end up a bone of contention for the rest of the marriage, if it even lasts.", "OP said they could afford a one-off $200 payment for the sister.\n\nThat's *very* different from $1200 discretionary spending per month when there are 4 kids involved -- especially given that OP's disclosure of their salary shows that it is comfortable, not lavish. They need to be putting a lot of money into savings for their retirements and their kids' educations.", "OP also said she exaggerated how much her husband gives his sister in the comments so I doubt it actually is anywhere close to the $600 (not sure where you got $1200 from?) \n\nEven ignoring that, the fact that she doesn\u2019t even mention the supposed $600 being a strain on their finances makes me doubt that it is really negatively impacting them financially? I mean any real person going through this would highlight the fact that the money was hurting the family as a whole if they didn\u2019t want to come off as being the AH in this scenario. Like if that was true it would have been the crux of the whole argument not a simple afterthought."]}
