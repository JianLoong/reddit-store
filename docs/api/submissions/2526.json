My dad is despondent because I guess the longer a car theft goes the harder it is to find it. I feel so bad.\n\nHe\u2019s so mad at me (my mom is too) because I park my XTerra right next to the Porsche and I did not see that it was gone for the entire week.

YTA for being oblivious. How do you not notice a missing car when you're parking right next to it? How do you not notice an apparent breaking and entering? Like, wtf", "Okay. There is seriously something MAJORLY wrong here for you to not notice that the car was gone. And for an entire week no less. I know this sounds harsh, but you are very disconnected from the world around you. I don't know if it is youthful absent mindedness, ADD,  or a lot of apathy, but you really should have noticed this. Your father is rightfully pissed. Be prepared to move out.", "Yeah YTA. They asked you to watch their place which would include the car.  You parked right next to the vehicle and then the empty spot and just didn\u2019t notice? Not sure how that is possible.  Sorry, but your dad has every right to be mad.", "YTA. \n\nI am not for kicking even adult children out of the house but this is a \"kick out of the house\" offense. Either you know who did it, had something to do with it or just lack an investment in what is going on in the home you are staying in. You parked next to an empty spot for days and didn't notice the car was gone. You didn't notice that someone had broken into the home (which is a safety risk for everyone living there).", "YTA.\n\nHow in the freaking world did you just not notice an entire car was missing?? Even if you park there every single day, you should be aware of your surroundings when parking and you just didn\u2019t notice it? I\u2019d be livid with you too.", "YTA.  If you truly didn't notice it being gone for 1.5 weeks you have  some major issue.  It is not possible that you would not have noticed a missing car that your dad loves that much.   Im sure your parents have difficulty believing that either. \n\nWhat a coincidence that it is stolen from inside a garage when it wasnt visible from the street, the very time your parents were out of town and you were staying with the dogs.  Really,.how would they even know there was a car in there and know to break the cameras beforehand unless someone \ud83d\udc49told them", "You literally park right next to it IN the garage?! There\u2019s no way you didn\u2019t notice it missing. YTA", "YTA -\n\nThey asked you to watch the house. You not only didn't (you weren't home that night, interesting) but you then proceeded not to take a mental inventory of one of your fathers most prized possessions.\n\nIf a dog had gotten sick on your watch and you didn't notice would you be here right now?", "YTA. Either you're covering for someone or incredibly unobservant. You used that space many times where you should have realised, but didn't according to your account pick up that something was missing from right under your nose. A big part of driving safely is checking your mirrors, if you were so nervous about not damaging it you'd look out for it when leaving and returning in your car.", "YTA.  Nice try.  Your story is ridiculous and I am sure neither the police nor anyone else is buying it.", "You are definitely not observant. Not noticing it gone for a week. I can see why your dad is upset. The car is gone, forever.\n\nThe big question is-who knew you were housesitting and parents were out of town. The person that stole this car is someone you know and most likely someone in your friend group.  This wasn't a random situation or it would have occurred long. before and other things would be stolen. So, who did you blab or brag to? Who knew you stayed away from home that night? I think if you think hard, ADHD or not, you know who stole it.\n\nThat car was fine in the garage for many, many years. I see why they are upset.", "YTA\n\n> just be present in the house\n\nYou don't get a house-sitter to \"be present.\" You get a house-sitter to **watch your stuff**.\n\n*You didn't watch the stuff.*", "That's a tough one. Clearly you just zoned out for whatever reason and didn't ignore the missing car on purpose.  But it's pretty wild that you parked right beside it and didn't notice it was gone. Like, how??  I can see why they're fuming mad after trusting you to keep an eye on the place. YTA, not for being an actual asshole, but just....irresponsibly oblivious?", "Yes, YTA.\n\n> asked me to stay so I could feed the dogs and just be present in the house. They were gone for 1.5 weeks.\n\nYou agreed to look after things.  Something like a car is pretty obvious, and something that you would notice is missing.", "It's a little coincidental that it was stolen on the one night you weren't in the house/your parents were away and that you didn't notice for a week. I park next to my bf in the garage, and I ALWAYS notice when he's out. We share one double garage door, so I literally have to look into the garage when I drive up. Unless your garage has two single garage doors, I'm having a hard time believing you just zoned out.\n\nHowever, if your garage DOES have two single doors, I could understand why you didn't notice. Sometimes, there is a small barrier/extra space between the cars with these garages, and you may not notice if you aren't looking in that direction.", "YTA.  I don't believe your story sorry and I suspect the police don't either.", "YTA how do you park right next to the porsche's spot for Days and just not notice its gone", "So, according to you comments, the night of the theft, you weren't home, you had taken the dogs with you because you love them...\n\nsounds like you were knew what was going down.\n\nHope they find the car and arrest everyone related to the crime. \n\nYTA", "YTA ..  how do you not notice a whole car just missing when you\u2019re the only one home. Like please walk me through it not being weird. You\u2019re not a child & even if you avoid the car doesn\u2019t mean it becomes invisible. This is serious because it shows your lack of awareness in your surroundings. Take this as a wake up call.", "YTA.  It\u2019s called situational awareness. Look it up.", "YTA- if you didn\u2019t park next to the empty spot all week I would be more forgiving BUT YOU LITERALLY HAD DOZENS OF CHANCES TO SEE THE CAR WAS MISSING", "Wait what? I don\u2019t understand how you park your car next to it and didn\u2019t notice it was gone. I call BS-YTA.", "There's 3 possibilities\n\n1) You did it or helped do it. A friend stole it while you had your alibi and you left the house empty for the night dog free to ease the way.\n\n2) They were casing the place either by watching or someone you know knew you wouldn't be home nor the dogs would be there and arranged it but you're not involved. \n\n3) You have a major major case of undiagnosed something. It's possible to be this oblivious. To cross something and not register it and have your brain somehow not connect the dots that the empty spot next to your car means your dad's car isn't there and that it was supposed to be. It's a classical symptom of ADHD, specially in women. We do tend to manifest it in more \"air head\" ways as opposed to the traditional can't stand still view. ADHD is also someone misnamed. It has to do with executive functions issues and that seems like it. And if not that, something like that. It seems like obliviousness/hyperfocus in a moderate to severe level. Get a psychological evaluation done by a professional. \n\nBecause I don't have enough information, I can't make a judgement. So I guess INFO?", "I had a classic Porsche & I\u2019m still pissed that my ex sold it.  I really feel for your dad.  YTA", "YTA you were there to take care of the home and an entire car disappeared and you didn\u2019t notice? \n\nIt sounds like an inside job\u2026", "YTA and likely have something to do with it", "YTA. How can you not notice a car is missing? I can understand if it happened the day they were to return and you were out, but a car missing like that for days is something I cant believe youve missed", "Info: was it gone when you arrived, or stolen sometime during your stay?", "YTA\n\nI was gonna say NTA , but you do park your car right next to the Porsche. You are useless at best and a conspirator at worse.", "INFO Are you a drinker, by chance?", "Ong, Paris, is that you.", "Are you high most of the time? YTA.", "YTA. How do you not notice something the size of a car missing? Did you even feel the slightest hint of \"Hold on, something isn't right\"?", "YTA and if it was a 356 you\u2019re lucky to still be breathing.", "And here I thought no one could goober up their dad's Porsche worse than Cameron...\n\nDude, how did that happen? Especially since you parked RIGHT NEXT TO IT? Part of house sitting is making sure everything and everyone in the home is safe...did you feed the dogs, or did you not notice they were there? I'm not saying that to be a meanie, but my mind in genuinely boggled.\n\nYeah YTA, that's a pretty colossal mistake.", "YTA, Ferris is that you?", "YTA\u2026something isn\u2019t adding up. At all. Even with ADD, ADHD, alcohol, or drugs, it\u2019s pretty much impossible to miss a car being gone for a week. I\u2019m sorry, man, but I just can\u2019t believe this story as you\u2019ve told it.", "Yta you are in it , for sure.", "YTA. You either stole it or had someone steal it.", "YTA I am pretty oblivious to things, but when I\u2019m tasked with house sitting I make sure to make sure everything is in order. This isn\u2019t a didn\u2019t notice we ran out of milk situation, this is a so detached from your surroundings that you didn\u2019t notice a full blown car that you park next to is missing along with damaged security cameras. If you are that oblivious, you really shouldn\u2019t be agreeing to look after households when people are out of town.", "I would understand if you didn't notice once. Ok you may pulled in and hurry inside literally not looking your step but it was a full week? Yeah that makes you TA.\n\n\nAnd it feels so sketchy like you had something to do with it. If this is real and you didn't see then dude atart to observe more, not only your surrounding but people also. Lift that head out of your butt or phone and see the world.", "YTA how do you not notice a Porsche missing? One you know should be there, one you are parking next to everyday! How do you miss that? The only way you not the AH is if it was stolen before your parents left.", "YTA. How could you not notice an entire car was missing?", "YTA. But honestly I think you need to go to the doctor. Something is wrong with you.", "YTA huh?? How do you park next to their car every single day and not notice it was gone a week ago?? Like it's a whole ass car and you didn't notice it missing..", "Your dad doesn't have an locator tile or anything like that on the car? \n\nEven if the camera was smashed wouldn't there be footage of it bei g smashed?", "My friend. I know which of my neighbors are home every time I leave my house and every time I come home. Every day. Since I learned to drive when I was 16 I have noticed these things. And I have noticed when someone's car isn't present and when they are and asked where their car is. So if one of my family members's cars was gone when I knew they were elsewhere and couldn't have taken it, you bet I would have noticed in the first minute I was able, and you should have too. Definite YTA.", "YTA. You were supposed to be watching over things and you failed to do so repeatedly. \n\nI'd be doing some pretty deep research into why this went unnoticed by you for so long tbh. It sounds like you've dulled your observation skills down to almost nothing which is a huge concern. \n\nTechnology and our society today makes it very easy for us to switch off and run on autopilot 24/7. Taking the time to unplug from social media/digital world, sitting outside with nature and addressing your diet and lifestyle can all help to reawaken your senses. YWBTA if you didn't take this incident as a sign that you need to work on your observation skills.", "YTA. We\u2019re similar ages and I have a shitty memory. First of all, you should always be hyper aware of your surroundings. \nSecond of all, to drive you need to use your eyes. How irresponsible and uncaring of your surroundings are you that you don\u2019t notice A CAR THAT PARK NEXT TO EVERY DAY was stolen FOR A WEEK? If it was a small trinket I could understand not noticing but IT\u2019S A CAR. \n\nYour age is not an excuse. Either:\n1) you are so absorbed in yourself that you don\u2019t care what happens around\n2)you\u2019re dumb as bricks and don\u2019t still don\u2019t care about the things around you.\n3) you have some underlying issues you should checked out asap.\n\nOne family member of mine has a car that\u2019s been in their driveway since before I was born and I would notice instantly if it wasn\u2019t there. The fact that you\u2019re so used to it should have made it even more obvious when it was gone. I feel so bad for your dad.", "WTF?! How do you just\u2026not notice a missing car that you park to on a regular basis?! YTA and not gonna lie, part of me wonders if you were somehow involved to just \u201cnot notice\u201d for a whole week.", "This doesn't sound real to me, bet it's just some kids fantasy story", "YTA. Didn't even read the explanation. Try harder bro.", "YTA\n\nNormally you park next to this car and you never noticed that it\u2019s not there? I would be so pissed as a parent, especially because the car has a sentimental value to it. I\u2019m disappointed on your parents behalf\u2026wtf", "Mild YTA.\n\nBut is your dad really serious about kicking you out? Does he love that car that much?", "What color is the Porsche?", "YTA - I get it and could honestly see myself not noticing a car missing but part of being paid to house sit is being there in case something like this happens and noticing these things. You are there in part to call the police if something gets stolen. \n\nAlso in one of your comments you mention that you weren\u2019t even there that night? I\u2019m glad you weren\u2019t there and didn\u2019t get hurt but what is the point of housesitting if you don\u2019t spend the night there?", "please get checked for ADHD.", "I mean, if you weren\u2019t home at all, it still would have been stolen, and they still would have found it missing a week later. Is it kinda silly that you didn\u2019t notice? Yes, but, some people just aren\u2019t very observant. You could have maybe been a hero if you noticed it immediately, but I find it hard to fault you.

Maybe it fell off the jacks and rolled through the back wall of the garage and landed in the woods. \n\nBut for realsies I say NTA. A bit irresponsible maybe but not an AH.

I don't think it's possible to even BE that blind.", "YTA and honestly I don't think you realize how bad this looks to your parents. The one night you were gone with the dogs and it's stolen? You realize you are being looked at as an accomplice right? Even Chief Wiggums would be sitting there going it don't add up. In the eyes of the police, you'd definitely be a suspect.\nAs such, this feels like a something something missing information post. Did you brag about your father's car? Are you one of those people that have to update your social media every time you make a move?\nOverall, I think you should start thinking about your future. This isn't an 'oopsie, oh well' screw up.
