You\u2019re NTA for not wanting the baby there, but it\u2019s more important than just because \u2018they will just cry the whole time\u201d\n\nEdit: also, a 15 and 17 year old also shouldn\u2019t be at that party either. It really should be an adult only thing. That part is kind of messed up as well.", "NAH - Some work parties start early so people with babies, or people who don\u2019t drink, can socialize and then leave the party before the actual alcohol comes out. As far as you know, this mother might just be planning to drop by but not stay for the drinks and weed. However, it\u2019s okay for you to express your thoughts and feelings, because on the surface it doesn\u2019t sound like the best environment for a baby if they\u2019re planning to stay for a long time.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t sound like a good environment for a 15 and 17 year old, tbh. Though the same argument could be said of them maybe not staying to the time when the alcohol starts flowing.", "NTA for not wanting a baby around a bunch of drunk people with loud music and smoke everywhere. \n\nI would argue that this kind of party isn\u2019t exactly the best environment for *any* minor, but a baby\u2019s system is *much* more sensitive than a mid-late teenager. I would be more worried about its health than anything. \n\nFor one, you\u2019re right about the loud music. Their ears are very sensitive and people not taking this into account is what causes many children to grow up with tinnitus. It doesn\u2019t always happen, but it is common enough.\n\nPlus, accidents are more prone to happen while under the influence, esp if you\u2019re going to be faded. It\u2019s just not safe. Just because the mother is tending to her baby and doing everything she\u2019s supposed to do, doesn\u2019t mean someone else won\u2019t fall and knock something into the child or accidentally push the mom over. Not that I\u2019m saying people will get rowdy, but being faded can make you stumble and not really have a good sense of your surroundings. Speaking from experience.\n\nAnd for anybody who says it\u2019s \u201cnobody\u2019s business\u201d. I would argue that a baby is a person, and not an object, and their health is far more important than their mother\u2019s ego.", "INFO: Who is actually hosting it?\n\nYou? Your mom? The resturant itself? A Family Friend?\n\n>Answer:My parents who own the restaurant are hosting, all employees are invited + a select few\n\nYTA, but only slightly. You are not the host, you have no say. The hosts get to decide what is welcome and what isn't, not you. If they are okay with it, then that's all there is to it.\n\nI can get being concerned for a baby, I totally agree it's not a good setting for a baby. But it's also not your choice. It's your parents and the mothers.", "Your problem isn't with your position, but your presentation. \n\nShowing concern for the baby first would have made it so much easier to sell, but instead you went with \"stupid\" which is kind of a stupid way to dismiss something. If you want to reject an idea, you need a basis for it and \"stupid\" will never fly. \n\nYTA, but only superficially.", "So there's going to be two other minor children at the party and you're going to be drinking heavily and smoking pot in front of them, but you're worried about the baby, not even thinking that this person is very likely planning to skip out early and is just making an appearance for politeness. Your mom is right, you're skewed.\n\nYTA.", "First, you're not a parent and you don't know how the baby will react or what the parents will do about it.   \n\nSecond, the whole alcohol/weed thing is rendered nonsense by the fact that there will be kids who are 15 and 17   \n\nThird, inviting the baby is bullshit.  You're asking about inviting a parent who might well get a sitter or not even come.\n\nSo, YTA", "NYA.  But you expressed it poorly.  In lieu of \"stupid,\" you should use phrases like \"not a good idea\" and \"premises liability\" and \"not a great environment for a toddler.\"  When your first argument is \"this is stupid\" people will see it as immature and confrontational and they will ignore you.", "NTA but why the hell are there gonna be two children there around drugs and alcohol?", "NTA no place for a baby is around a ton of drunk adults.", "NTA. This does not an appropriate setting for a baby and I would hope even if the invitation was extended that the mom would recognize it would be best not to bring her child.", "NTA. Babies and weed don't mix.", "YTA. Let the mother decide how she wants to handle the invitation and her baby. Don't tell her what to do.", "Of course YTA what makes you think that you have any say about any of this? Not your kid it\u2019s none of your business", "YTA-it's none of your business. Sounds like a family party in a restaurant. If you're gonna grinch, don't go.", "NTA Maybe you should suggest that since we will having a baby at the party we will no longer allow alcohol or drugs. Why was the mother with the baby invited to a work party if she doesn't work there?", "NTA invite who you want. What kind of mother willingly brings a baby into that kind of environment anyway?", "Yta  this is none of your business", "NTA-\n\nThe mother would be an AH for bringing a baby knowing there is weed involved,the 15 and 17 year old shouldn\u2019t be going either if weed is involved.", "NTA some events are child free for a reason and that is ok. Kids aren't entitled to an invite and parents have to learn that they had kids and that means that some events they won't be able to go to and some events they need to get a babysitter.", "NTA\n\nThe other kids shouldn\u2019t be there either. Does the mom know it\u2019s going to be partying or is she expecting like a work Christmas party or something? Once you have kids your partying is over.", "NTA because you can decide who you want to invite/not invite but when my kid was younger we would take them to parties (when they were invited). We would leave early, no one smokes inside and they wore headphones. Snuggled up on me in a carrier and mostly slept.", "YTA mind your own business.", "NTA. it's ur party and if you don't want babies in there that's fine.", "YTA.  The baby\u2019s parents are capable of deciding whether it\u2019s an appropriate environment (and if they\u2019re not, then you\u2019re really missing the forest for the trees here).  \n\nAnd it\u2019s not like a one-year-old is going to be corrupted by seeing you smoke pot.  If that\u2019s your concern, then you should be more worried about the 15-year-old than the one-year-old.  \n\nBut ultimately, since you are not hosting the party, it\u2019s not your decision and your opinion doesn\u2019t really matter.  All you\u2019re doing is making the parents feel unwelcome.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly drinking and smoking around teens is a worse influence than doing it around a baby since the baby won't care, but it might actually set a bad example for the teens. \n\nIf you're saying the party is too adult for the baby, then the teens shouldn't be there. \n\nIf you're fine with the teens there then you're a hypocrite for the reasons you stated. Be honest and just say you don't want a baby at your party, and not because you are legitimately thinking about the baby's well being. \n\nNTA for not wanting a baby at a party but you're not being honest about your reasons.", "Ask your mom what part of an adult party with alcohol snd weed should a one year old partake?  You are right in your thinking.  Is there no one to babysit?  Why is she even invited?  Your mom is a dolt calling you a bad person for looking out for a child. Go, ignore the child snd have fun. When the one yo is overwhelmed and cranky, you can say not my problem.", "NTA", "Agree with that last point. I was thinking the same thing.
