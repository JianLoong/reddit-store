If you are staying in Montreal long term it might be an idea to sound more Quebecois but if your French is comprehensible to all I don't see that as an obligation.

As a white American, when I travel in Quebec I have only encountered people who seem neutral toward my non-Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois French and people who seem delighted that I speak any French at all.
