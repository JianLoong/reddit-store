And I'll tell you why.  My dad sometimes made comments about girls in revealing clothes \"asking for it.\"  He didn't even say this directly to me, but he said it around me, and I took in that of girls dressed sexy it was their fault if something happened.  So then when I was about 13 or 14 we went on vacation to a theme park.  My cousin and I were in a dark ride queue for a roller coaster.  She was wearing a crop top and short cut-offs, I was wearing a crop top and a skirt.  Some older guys behind us started commenting and trying to talk to us.  We tried to ignore them.  At a certain point in the dark line they started bumping up against us and we tried to ignore them.  Then they started grabbing at us.  One guy reached around and grabbed at my breast and put his other hand literally on my ass and crotch under my skirt.  We freaked out and pushed our way backwards through the line.  I told my parents the line was too long.  I never told them I was assaulted.  I felt like it was my fault because I had a crop top and a form-fitting skirt.  I felt like I was \"asking for it.\"  I was so ashamed that this happened to me.  I'm in my mid 40s now.  I still remember this incident.  I never told my parents to this day.  I realize now that I was not to blame, but I totally internalized that I was asking for it for years.  Please, focus on safety but don't focus on clothing that way.  Women are assaulted wearing anything and everything.  If covering up prevented assault, countries with very modest standards would have no sexual assault, and we know that's not true.  Talk about safety, being alert to surroundings, not wearing headphones, etc.  Don't tell her that her clothes are too revealing and will get her assaulted.  YTA for that message.", "YTA.
