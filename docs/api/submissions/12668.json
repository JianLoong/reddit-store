Prior to us meeting, I had been in a 5 years relationship with my ex. My ex came from another country, on another continent, so his native language and his culture were extremely different from mine.\n\nMe and my ex both came from non-English speaking country, and I rapidly started learning his mother tongue, picked up a lot of his culture (food, manners\u2026). I traveled to his country about 5 times and lived there for 3 years as well. So, when we broke up and I went back to my country, I spoke the language fluently and had picked up the culture (for exemple, I would mostly cook food from my ex country\u2019s as it was really good and I got used to it).\n\nAnyway, I met my current bf. He comes from a different country as well but he grew up learning and speaking English at home. He also speak another language with his family.\n\nWhen I met him, I forced myself to stop \u2018using\u2019 the culture of my ex as my bf \u2018didn\u2019t like the food\u2019 and found a lot of other things weird. At the same time, I got busy and stopped practicing the language I had spent nearly 4 years learning.\n\nLong story short, I recently realized that I couldn\u2019t speak the language fluently anymore and freaked out: because I spent lots of time , money and efforts into it. So, I decided to start learning the language again, and at the same time, I started living the way I used to live prior to meeting my bf again: aka I have started cooking old dishes, watch a lot of movies from my ex country\u2019s ect\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m reconnecting after a long time.\n\nWell, multiple times my bf said this is disturbing to him and asked if my plan was to get back with my ex. He said that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m probably learning the language again and picking up the culture again. He said that because it is not my own culture, I\u2019m being really weird and a bit of an AH for \u2018using\u2019 another culture. \n\nHe also mentioned the fact that I haven\u2019t start learning his own language. The reason why I haven\u2019t is because first, there aren\u2019t many resources only, second, he, his family and everyone around him speak fluent English and third, I have told myself that I would learn it if I get married to him. He is really pissed at me, and no matter how many times I try to explain that the only reason I\u2019m learning the language again and \u2018using\u2019 the culture is because I spent nearly 4 years of my life experiencing this culture and not only did I got used to it, I also enjoyed it a lot. \n\nI am torn as I can understand my bf point of view, but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong.\n\nEdit: forgot to add that while I haven\u2019t started learning my bf\u2019s language, I have learned a lot about his own culture and been cooking traditional dishes for him pretty often. On his side, he has neither learned my mother tongue nor my culture so I also don\u2019t feel like he is being fair either", "created_utc": 1679225081, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11vithx/aita_for_learning_my_exs_language/", "score": 315, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
