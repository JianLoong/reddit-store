Prior to us meeting, I had been in a 5 years relationship with my ex. My ex came from another country, on another continent, so his native language and his culture were extremely different from mine.\n\nMe and my ex both came from non-English speaking country, and I rapidly started learning his mother tongue, picked up a lot of his culture (food, manners\u2026). I traveled to his country about 5 times and lived there for 3 years as well. So, when we broke up and I went back to my country, I spoke the language fluently and had picked up the culture (for exemple, I would mostly cook food from my ex country\u2019s as it was really good and I got used to it).\n\nAnyway, I met my current bf. He comes from a different country as well but he grew up learning and speaking English at home. He also speak another language with his family.\n\nWhen I met him, I forced myself to stop \u2018using\u2019 the culture of my ex as my bf \u2018didn\u2019t like the food\u2019 and found a lot of other things weird. At the same time, I got busy and stopped practicing the language I had spent nearly 4 years learning.\n\nLong story short, I recently realized that I couldn\u2019t speak the language fluently anymore and freaked out: because I spent lots of time , money and efforts into it. So, I decided to start learning the language again, and at the same time, I started living the way I used to live prior to meeting my bf again: aka I have started cooking old dishes, watch a lot of movies from my ex country\u2019s ect\u2026 I feel like I\u2019m reconnecting after a long time.\n\nWell, multiple times my bf said this is disturbing to him and asked if my plan was to get back with my ex. He said that\u2019s the only reason I\u2019m probably learning the language again and picking up the culture again. He said that because it is not my own culture, I\u2019m being really weird and a bit of an AH for \u2018using\u2019 another culture. \n\nHe also mentioned the fact that I haven\u2019t start learning his own language. The reason why I haven\u2019t is because first, there aren\u2019t many resources only, second, he, his family and everyone around him speak fluent English and third, I have told myself that I would learn it if I get married to him. He is really pissed at me, and no matter how many times I try to explain that the only reason I\u2019m learning the language again and \u2018using\u2019 the culture is because I spent nearly 4 years of my life experiencing this culture and not only did I got used to it, I also enjoyed it a lot. \n\nI am torn as I can understand my bf point of view, but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m doing anything wrong.\n\nEdit: forgot to add that while I haven\u2019t started learning my bf\u2019s language, I have learned a lot about his own culture and been cooking traditional dishes for him pretty often.

He doesn\u2019t respect you. He will not change. Please do not marry this man (I know you\u2019re not engaged but you mentioned the potential for marriage). I promise it gets *so much worse* once they lock you in. I\u2019m speaking from experience.", "\\> \u2018using\u2019 another culture.\n\nSorry but ,your bf is the asshole here.\n\nIt is already a part of you now, simple as that.  \nIf he can't accept that, he can't fully accept you for who you are.\n\nIt's one thing if he doesn't like the taste of XY, in that case you can just cook it not as often.\n\nHowever he appears to have general problems just with your daily life showing signs of another culture.\n\nYour bf is insecure because he doesn't seem to trust you.", "NTA. Why would anyone discourage someone from learning, or relearning, something they enjoyed?

Along with any other languages you know or want to learn.", "Info: why do you refuse to mention what the cultures and languages are? It sounds like you're hiding something", "NTA - Its good to keep up with another language full stop. You future ex boyfriend is insecure and that's that.\n\nYou are cooking food he likes and have stopped cooking stuff you have cooked for years? I assume he has learnt how to cook food for you too or something equivalent to that?

Isn't that why Asian, Indian, Mexican etc restaurants are so popular?  Because people become fond of a subset of food that is not their own \"culturally\"?  Why do you have to give up things you enjoy?\n\nYour boyfriend is being insecure, Keep this in mind, because his behavior reads as controlling(red flag).  What other red flags does he show?  \n\nEDIT shows another red flag--it's all about bending to HIS culture/preferences and he is not returning the effort.", "NTA\n\nPeople don\u2019t stop speaking a language, eating certain food etc just because it\u2019s from their ex\u2019s culture.

An extra language can only benefit you.", "Oh, there's an AH here and it ain't OP.\n\nNTA\n\nOP, there are so many **red flags** here. You need to put on your big girl pants and have sit down discussion with him. He either changes his attitude based on this discussion or you need to get your ass out the door. He either trusts you or he doesn't and if he doesn't you will be miserable if you stay with him. \n\nIf possible, put the relationship on pause and let him experience what not having you in his life will look like. This is the tried & true method to deal with immature men & women. Worked on my brother and worked on my current SO: once they see what they will be missing, they reevaluate their outlook.", "YTA, but not for the reason you think. It's not that you started relearning your ex's language. It's because you learned your ex's language while just being in a relationship without marriage and for your current bf you say that you will learn his language once you get married. Makes it seem like you hold your ex in higher regards that he was worth learning a language for while your current bf is not.", "NTA. I love the Spanish language, took it in high school (not a good teacher so it ended up being absolutely useless to me) and again in college. I had to drop out of college but I am still trying to continue to learn it. I have never been in a relationship with anyone who speaks the language, I just love it. I don\u2019t know the culture so I don\u2019t try to learn it either. I am even teaching my grandchildren to speak it as best as I can. My grandson will hopefully call me \u201cabuela\u201d instead of grandma once he can speak. He understands the stuff I have been saying since he was born. I am raising him so I speak it every day, just not a whole lot unfortunately. You don\u2019t need a reason to speak-the only reason needs to be because you want to period !", "NTA", "NTA.

You will learn his language when he learns yours.", "I only speak English, and when I decided I wanted to relearn Spanish in 2018 (high school Spanish was in 1973-1975!), I discovered that my then-58-year-old ears were no longer good enough to really learn spoken Spanish.  It was a terrible disappointment.  News flash, my ears aren't getting any better.\n\nOP, revel in ALL the languages you know, and spend some time keeping current in them and getting better.  If you have the time/inclination, learn more, for YOUR sake.  No one else's.  They are part of the toolkit that God/Universe/Serendipity will use to throw future opportunities your way.

Should I ever move back to the country of my origin, am I supposed to forget everything I've learned to cook, eat and speak? Geez. OP's boyfriend is an idiot.

I get your BF's point of view though, however misguided as it is. You learned a new language and definitely put in some work and time to do so, so obviously you want to maintain it as it's a part of you now.

Whether is because he is a control freak or because he is insecure about your previous relationship. Either way, you enjoyed the language, the culture, the food. Doesn't matter what he wants. There is no reason why you should stop enjoying any of it because it is different from your boyfriend or because he doesn't like it. There is never anything wrong with learning new things or loving to do what you already learned. I love seafood. My husband hates it. Hates the taste, the smell, everything. Doesn't mean that I have to quit eating it. It just means that I go to the local seafood restaurant by myself with a good book to read, or with someone other than him. He doesn't get to make me stop eating seafood. He doesn't get to decide what you learn or enjoy, period.", "BF screams small pee-pee energy. NTA by the way OP but your current bf sure is one.", "NTA.

So that sense of \"home\" was tied to me living on the opposite side of the country. I wanted to recreate feeling at home, ergo, searching for the best oxtail in the area. \n\nYour bf is insecure and holding you to double standards, since you mentioned you're already learning a lot about his culture and he's showing no effort to do the same.", "\"On his side, he has neither learned my mother tongue nor my culture so I also don\u2019t feel like he is being fair either.\" Right. So he's pissed that you haven't learned his language when he hasn't bothered to learn yours? That's not how this works.\n\nNTA.
