{"id": 20784, "submission_id": "14ktcpk", "title": "AITA for telling my niece something she did not want to hear?", "selftext": "My husband Jimmy and I are extremely close to our niece, Jilly, and she feels very close to us, especially to her uncle. She thinks we're the only people who truly love and care about her. We retired shortly before she was born, and don't live very far from her, so she spent a huge chunk of her life with us. Unfortunately, she's been through a lot of horrible trauma, and developed mental health issues from it. She often escaped to our house \"to get away from it all and instead be in the one safe place she knows where she is loved and feels cared for and wanted\". She often told us all it took for her to feel better were big warm hugs, love, and affection from us and she felt safe telling us her secrets and being herself because she knew we wouldn't harm her.\n\n  \nSadly, we haven't been able to be there for her as much as we normally can because Jimmy has been sick with cancer for a while now, and it's recently gotten to the point where it's incurable. We have been fighting on how to tell her. Telling her the initial news, he has cancer, did not go well. He has been in/out of the hospital. Jilly has found it very difficult to visit him there as hospital rooms are triggering for her. She said it also broke her heart, seeing him like that and the wires and equipment prevent her from being able to hug him for comfort. Multiple times she tried to convince him to leave AMA. When he was home, all she wanted to do was snuggle in his arms, be with him, and live in denial. She asked us to not tell her any news relating to the cancer unless \"it's gone\".\n\n  \nJimmy didn't want to tell her the bad news because he knew it would shatter her into a million pieces and he wanted to make the time he has left to do some special things for her so she would have some more beautiful memories to hold on to after he passes. Jilly just went through something horribly traumatic just before we got the news he's become terminal, and Jimmy thinks she should have some time where she does not have to deal with pain. I know she said she doesn't want updates, but this is something I think she should know so she can prepare herself for it. In the end, we told her and to say she didn't take it well was an understatement.\n\n  \nShe blew up and told us she'd rather relive her trauma on repeat 24/7 than exist in a world where she's unloved. She called him \"a huge asshole who abandons a child that loves him\" and was furious at me for telling her something she clearly didn't want any updates on. Jimmy is angry too because he hates seeing her like this and not being able to do anything about it. all Jilly wants is cuddles, and often gets in the way of any medical professionals that come to take care of him. There is no wrangling her away from him. She often sobs into his arms, and begs him not to leave her behind. He tries his best to comfort her while he is alert, and often tries to hug her even when it hurts. We both feel horrible and guilty for putting her through the worst pain of her life.

Unless she is younger than 7 years old, it would be impossible for me to overlook the fact that she is making her uncle's terminal diagnosis and the fact that her aunt is losing her life partner all about her. Whatever her trauma is, that is no excuse for being such an A-H to someone who is dying.", "Wow, there is a lot to unpack here. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA, uncle Jimmy isn\u2019t \u201cabandoning a child that loves him\u201d, he\u2019s dying from incurable cancer. Jilly needs to understand what that means.\n\nYou and Jimmy obviously want to spend as much quality time and make as many good memories as possible before you can\u2019t, I think that\u2019s completely normal and healthy. What\u2019s not healthy is living in denial of what is inevitably going to happen as the cancer runs it\u2019s course. Jilly sounds like a selfish brat to me. May I ask how old is she, and who\u2019s actual niece is she?", "NTA. Yes, Jilly is attached, but this is your husband. To try and interfere with his medical care is unacceptable, as well as your remaining time together \n\nJilly\u2019s pain comes from her traumatic past. Please don\u2019t think of it as your and your husband causing this pain. He didn\u2019t choose to get cancer. The best thing for Jilly immediate grief and trauma counselling.\n\nEdit to add - she can\u2019t live in dream land. Your husband is already deteriorating. It\u2019s unrealistic to have him require increased care and pass away in front of her.", "NTA. Better to hear it from you in a controlled, loving manner. You can't hide a terminal cancer diagnosis from someone. People are gonna find out.  Maybe when the hospice worker came by, maybe when an aide was helping out.\n\nHelp her get the help she needs, but you really CAN'T sugar coat this for her. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband's diagnosis. I hope that you have the help and support YOU need to get through this time, too.", "I'm hoping this child is five, maybe that would be an excuse. \nIn any case though nta. I'm very sorry for what you and your husband are going through.\n\nEta: op, having to manage the emotions of others while losing someone to cancer is a special kind of hell. This I know. And I'm very sorry that you personally are put in this position. I hope you have someone supporting you, and I send you lots of virtual hugs", "NTA. She really needs some trauma and grief counselling, so please get her the help she needs to succeed in life, it is not healthy to be so focused on 1 person to make you feel emotionally balanced. Remember you also need support through your grief of losing someone you love so take of yourself and I hope that you have people around you who can give you the support.", "NTA, but get that girl to therapy, set boundaries, this girl needs to be following a treatment plan for dealing with trauma and grief. It sounds right now like her mental health is poor and her behavior is somewhat out of control. She might need to spend some time in an outpatient or inpatient clinic until she's able to get back to a stable place (I am not a licensed counselor or psychologist, just my opinion)", "NTA. If she is any older than five years old I would be honesty tempted to cut her off for your own health. How could she possibly call TERMINAL CANCER the same as abandoning a child?", "I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to your family, processing the loss of your long term partner is unimaginable. You\u2019re definitely NTA, and your niece\u2019s grief and anger are not markers of how well/badly you\u2019re both doing, she has her own trauma she clearly needs help and support with. Whilst I understand you want to provide some of this you\u2019re also both dealing with your own loss and pain. Is there some outside support you can get in for all of you?", "This girl desperately needs psychological help.  I how you can help her find it or the outcome will not be pretty when her uncle passes. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Her being angry should not be how you assess whether you were right to tell her or not.  I hope she's a literal child, because even a teen who has experienced trauma should be able to understand 'get out of the bed while the nurses do <insert nursing task here>'.  She has emotional challenges from trauma, that is clear even to a layperson reading this and she asked to remain in denial.  Assuming she is a child, there are times we override children's requests for a number of reasons and this is a very difficult decision.  I'm not going to fault you for it.", "NTA - She was going to find out at some point. Is it better to know now and cherish each remaining or be ignorant of the end coming and be suddenly blindsided by the loss? \n\nI don't think there's really an easy way to handle this situation. You did what you thought was the right thing in letting her know. \n\nI think the most important thing to do now is to reassure her no matter how much time Jimmy has left, she is still loved. Also reassure her no matter what happens to Jimmy, you will still be there for her too.", "NTA. You were being compassionate to someone else while dealing with a impending passing of your husband. You didn't mention Jilly's age but she seems very immature or selfish. How would it have gone if you hadn't told her and the next time she saw her beloved uncle was in a casket?  Ot good, I'm sure. Time for little girl to grow up and perhaps see a professional.", "NTA\n\nEven though it can sound selfish selfish, I think you need to put boundaries with Jilly and you and your husband have to spend time together. This is about your husband. His last days cannot be about a person who has temper tantrums and making it miserable and sad. You are also loosing your partner.\n\nYour partner and you have to prioritize what he wants to do, and to make the most about his days. Enabling Jilly is not going to help anyone!!!! It's going to be a lot of missed time for him and you.\n\nYou need to call her parents or whomever to take her somewhere else.\n\nYou and your husband cannot do anything with the fact that she cannot control her emotions. She needs a lot of therapy and hopefully she already has a therapist, so call the therapist and send her away.", "Info - how old is Jilly?", "NTA.  Jill needs therapy starting now because when he passes, she will be a danger to herself.", "NTA - You've spent a lot of time trying to protect her and make her fill loved, but you won't be there forever to do that. Hiding the truth won't protect her, it will just make sure she won't be ready to face the world alone. \n\nThat's what you need to do now. Teach her to be strong enough to face the world without you.", "NTA you told the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts. I believe she\u2019s more angry about him being sick then directly angry at him.", "Um... there's something seriously wrong with her. She does not seem capable of managing her emotions, even a little,  without using your husband as an emotional support pillow. This dynamic screams unhealthy and she needs serious medical care like yesterday. \n\nYou're NTA for telling her the truth but she clearly needs professional help. Please help her get it. This seems way outside your ability to handle.\n\nYour husband also deserves some peace and support too qnd shouldn't be forced to feel guilt in his remaining time. .", "NTA\n\nWhy is Jilly making this situation about herself? Why is she tormenting you and Jimmy with her problems when you two are the ones needing support right now?! How old is she?", "NTA but it's truly terrible that your husband's terminal illness and what little time he has left is being overwhelmed by this.  It's time to take a look at what is in his best interest for this time, for your best interest.   This shouldn't go on like this.  He needs space and calm.  The worst pain of her life?  No.  That needs to end,   This should be about him.  And you.  She comes in third.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

From what you've written, she's needed help for years. Burying your heads in the sand all these years is partly what the issue is now. I'm very sorry for  what you are going through, but this is not normal behaviour.\n\nEdit: judgement", "Absolutely NTA \ud83d\udcaf . 'Jilly ' needs professional help, this behaviour is not normal.

Sounds to me like Jilly is facing losing her one escape from a terrible situation and is (wrongfully) lashing out at you because of it. It does beg the question of why she's still in that situation in the first place. \n\nIs Jilly in therapy? Does she have anyone else she can lean on besides you and your husband?

I wish the best for you and your family.", "NTA. Telling her was hard but a kind gesture overall. Jilly needs this time to process and I would highly suggest counselling if she isn\u2019t already. Speaking to specifically a grief councillor so she can start coming to terms with the reality and hopefully stop acting selfish and be more understanding and realistic that she is not being abandoned nor is she unloved.", "NTA. OP, I am so sorry for what you are going through. You and your husband sound like truly amazing people. \n\nAs for Jilly, I unfortunately can relate to what she is going through. I went through some personal trauma as well and ended up taking it out on the people I loved. I knew it was wrong, as I assume your neice knows deep down and that I was not truly being abandoned again. But, in the moment, it all feels so overwhelming and hopeless that you feel as though you can not control your emotions and you lash out. I can not tell you how guilty I feel and felt for the way I acted, and I've lost count of the number of times I have apologized. I am giving Jilly the benefit of the doubt for her actions and behavior, but I would recommend that she see a psychologist. That is what I am doing right now, and it does seem to be helping.\n\nOP, I want to personally thank you and your husband for everything you have done for Jilly.

You are doing great.", "NTA and I'm so sorry to hear what you and your husband are going through.

Her presence is toxic and problematic and is literally coming in the way of your husband getting the best care he can in his last remaining time on this earth. He deserves peace and quiet with you.", "You tried your best to protect and do what\u2019s best for your niece who is, as you described, in a fragile state\n\nBUT Yta.\n\nYou should not have told her that your husbands cancer has become terminal. Honestly, I don\u2019t think it was doing her any favors. She already has a lot going on, I bet deep down she knew he was not going to make it in the long run. I don\u2019t think it was in her best interest to share that news with her, especially because she had made it clear.\n\nI am so sorry for her and your family. This must be so rough. I feel for her. I was a child in her shoes and didn\u2019t feel loved from my own family. I know how it feels like to be in her shoes. She is frustrated, frustrated at the world. I can only imagine how it feels to have the only male role model in her life whom she trusted slowly pass. I am truly so sorry. You both seem like you\u2019ve made her feel loved when she had nobody else to go to. I wonder what her home situation is like? Regardless, don\u2019t beat yourself up. It is clear you are trying your best. There is a lot on your place right now, as well as Jillys. The fact that she finds comfort in you and your husband as opposed to her own home speaks volumes already. So give yourself a pat on the back, it sounds like you are trying your best. Again, I am so sorry for what you are all going through.\n\nEdit: it looks like I\u2019m gonna get downvoted because everyone is saying NTA!\n\nTo clarify, I am under the impression Jilly is still a minor?

I understand she has trauma but she\u2019s being inexcusably selfish at this incredibly difficult time in your lives. \n\nI am very sorry about your husbands diagnosis.", "NTA. Although, I'll admit that I got a little heated at the abandonment line. Like, Jimmy ain't abandoning her, he's literally fucking DYING. If she's younger than 10, then I'll get over it.", "NAH - Jilly needs to know you will still be a safe place for her, after Jimmy. She also deeply needs therapy, even as a child. I lost my aunt to brain cancer as a 6 year old and the whole ordeal traumatized me for years. Thank goodness my mother was proactive and helped me through it.", "My assumption based on the language used by Jilly is that she is at least a teen, if not older. She says she loves her uncle, but her behavior shows very clearly that she only truly cares for herself. She doesn\u2019t care if his medical condition worsens as long as she gets what she wants. She doesn\u2019t care if hugging her causes him pain because cuddles are what SHE wants, so to hell with his feelings. She doesn\u2019t care if the nurses cannot treat him and make him comfortable because SHE wants to be on the bed. She asks him to sacrifice his medical care AMA because SHE doesn\u2019t like hospital rooms. She doesn\u2019t care if her manipulative and hurtful words create stress and anxiety for her uncle in his final days, because if she\u2019s feeling stress then nobody else can have peace. She is creating friction in your marriage while you are no doubt dealing with anticipatory grief, and providing you with no support. Instead she is an additional emotional drain on you. Trauma or no trauma, she is a spoiled, selfish person with no boundaries, consideration or empathy for anyone else. NTA, and I am so sorry for what you are going through.", "Right - if she is anywhere close to adulthood someone needs to be getting this person some help and she might not be emotionally mature enough to receive this news.", "From context I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s (possibly) a minor but (based on wording) not a child (maybe teens). Possibly on the spectrum but I have no frame of reference for that, just given wording she supposedly used. \n\nEither way I think OP is NTA. My son was 7 when an uncle he was extremely close to died from ALS.  As much as I wish I could have spared him that heartbreak, I couldn\u2019t. Unfortunately, death is a part of life.
