She thinks we're the only people who truly love and care about her. We retired shortly before she was born, and don't live very far from her, so she spent a huge chunk of her life with us. Unfortunately, she's been through a lot of horrible trauma, and developed mental health issues from it. She often escaped to our house \"to get away from it all and instead be in the one safe place she knows where she is loved and feels cared for and wanted\". She often told us all it took for her to feel better were big warm hugs, love, and affection from us and she felt safe telling us her secrets and being herself because she knew we wouldn't harm her.\n\n  \nSadly, we haven't been able to be there for her as much as we normally can because Jimmy has been sick with cancer for a while now, and it's recently gotten to the point where it's incurable. We have been fighting on how to tell her. Telling her the initial news, he has cancer, did not go well. He has been in/out of the hospital. Jilly has found it very difficult to visit him there as hospital rooms are triggering for her. She said it also broke her heart, seeing him like that and the wires and equipment prevent her from being able to hug him for comfort. Multiple times she tried to convince him to leave AMA. When he was home, all she wanted to do was snuggle in his arms, be with him, and live in denial. She asked us to not tell her any news relating to the cancer unless \"it's gone\".\n\n  \nJimmy didn't want to tell her the bad news because he knew it would shatter her into a million pieces and he wanted to make the time he has left to do some special things for her so she would have some more beautiful memories to hold on to after he passes. Jilly just went through something horribly traumatic just before we got the news he's become terminal, and Jimmy thinks she should have some time where she does not have to deal with pain. I know she said she doesn't want updates, but this is something I think she should know so she can prepare herself for it. In the end, we told her and to say she didn't take it well was an understatement.\n\n  \nShe blew up and told us she'd rather relive her trauma on repeat 24/7 than exist in a world where she's unloved. She called him \"a huge asshole who abandons a child that loves him\" and was furious at me for telling her something she clearly didn't want any updates on. Jimmy is angry too because he hates seeing her like this and not being able to do anything about it. all Jilly wants is cuddles, and often gets in the way of any medical professionals that come to take care of him. There is no wrangling her away from him. She often sobs into his arms, and begs him not to leave her behind. He tries his best to comfort her while he is alert, and often tries to hug her even when it hurts. We both feel horrible and guilty for putting her through the worst pain of her life.

Unless she is younger than 7 years old, it would be impossible for me to overlook the fact that she is making her uncle's terminal diagnosis and the fact that her aunt is losing her life partner all about her. Whatever her trauma is, that is no excuse for being such an A-H to someone who is dying.", "Wow, there is a lot to unpack here. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA, uncle Jimmy isn\u2019t \u201cabandoning a child that loves him\u201d, he\u2019s dying from incurable cancer. Jilly needs to understand what that means.\n\nYou and Jimmy obviously want to spend as much quality time and make as many good memories as possible before you can\u2019t, I think that\u2019s completely normal and healthy. What\u2019s not healthy is living in denial of what is inevitably going to happen as the cancer runs it\u2019s course. Jilly sounds like a selfish brat to me. May I ask how old is she, and who\u2019s actual niece is she?", "NTA. Yes, Jilly is attached, but this is your husband. To try and interfere with his medical care is unacceptable, as well as your remaining time together \n\nJilly\u2019s pain comes from her traumatic past. Please don\u2019t think of it as your and your husband causing this pain. He didn\u2019t choose to get cancer. The best thing for Jilly immediate grief and trauma counselling.\n\nEdit to add - she can\u2019t live in dream land. Your husband is already deteriorating. It\u2019s unrealistic to have him require increased care and pass away in front of her.", "NTA. Better to hear it from you in a controlled, loving manner. You can't hide a terminal cancer diagnosis from someone. People are gonna find out.  Maybe when the hospice worker came by, maybe when an aide was helping out.\n\nHelp her get the help she needs, but you really CAN'T sugar coat this for her. And I'm sorry to hear about your husband's diagnosis. I hope that you have the help and support YOU need to get through this time, too.", "I'm hoping this child is five, maybe that would be an excuse. \nIn any case though nta. I'm very sorry for what you and your husband are going through.\n\nEta: op, having to manage the emotions of others while losing someone to cancer is a special kind of hell. This I know. And I'm very sorry that you personally are put in this position. I hope you have someone supporting you, and I send you lots of virtual hugs", "NTA. She really needs some trauma and grief counselling, so please get her the help she needs to succeed in life, it is not healthy to be so focused on 1 person to make you feel emotionally balanced. Remember you also need support through your grief of losing someone you love so take of yourself and I hope that you have people around you who can give you the support.", "NTA, but get that girl to therapy, set boundaries, this girl needs to be following a treatment plan for dealing with trauma and grief. It sounds right now like her mental health is poor and her behavior is somewhat out of control. She might need to spend some time in an outpatient or inpatient clinic until she's able to get back to a stable place (I am not a licensed counselor or psychologist, just my opinion)", "NTA. If she is any older than five years old I would be honesty tempted to cut her off for your own health. How could she possibly call TERMINAL CANCER the same as abandoning a child?", "I\u2019m so sorry this is happening to your family, processing the loss of your long term partner is unimaginable. You\u2019re definitely NTA, and your niece\u2019s grief and anger are not markers of how well/badly you\u2019re both doing, she has her own trauma she clearly needs help and support with.

I how you can help her find it or the outcome will not be pretty when her uncle passes. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  Her being angry should not be how you assess whether you were right to tell her or not.  I hope she's a literal child, because even a teen who has experienced trauma should be able to understand 'get out of the bed while the nurses do <insert nursing task here>'.  She has emotional challenges from trauma, that is clear even to a layperson reading this and she asked to remain in denial.  Assuming she is a child, there are times we override children's requests for a number of reasons and this is a very difficult decision.  I'm not going to fault you for it.", "NTA - She was going to find out at some point. Is it better to know now and cherish each remaining or be ignorant of the end coming and be suddenly blindsided by the loss? \n\nI don't think there's really an easy way to handle this situation. You did what you thought was the right thing in letting her know. \n\nI think the most important thing to do now is to reassure her no matter how much time Jimmy has left, she is still loved. Also reassure her no matter what happens to Jimmy, you will still be there for her too.", "NTA. You were being compassionate to someone else while dealing with a impending passing of your husband. You didn't mention Jilly's age but she seems very immature or selfish. How would it have gone if you hadn't told her and the next time she saw her beloved uncle was in a casket?  Ot good, I'm sure. Time for little girl to grow up and perhaps see a professional.", "NTA\n\nEven though it can sound selfish selfish, I think you need to put boundaries with Jilly and you and your husband have to spend time together. This is about your husband. His last days cannot be about a person who has temper tantrums and making it miserable and sad. You are also loosing your partner.\n\nYour partner and you have to prioritize what he wants to do, and to make the most about his days. Enabling Jilly is not going to help anyone!!!! It's going to be a lot of missed time for him and you.\n\nYou need to call her parents or whomever to take her somewhere else.\n\nYou and your husband cannot do anything with the fact that she cannot control her emotions. She needs a lot of therapy and hopefully she already has a therapist, so call the therapist and send her away.", "Info - how old is Jilly?", "NTA.  Jill needs therapy starting now because when he passes, she will be a danger to herself.", "NTA - You've spent a lot of time trying to protect her and make her fill loved, but you won't be there forever to do that. Hiding the truth won't protect her, it will just make sure she won't be ready to face the world alone. \n\nThat's what you need to do now. Teach her to be strong enough to face the world without you.", "NTA you told the truth. Sometimes the truth hurts. I believe she\u2019s more angry about him being sick then directly angry at him.", "Um... there's something seriously wrong with her. She does not seem capable of managing her emotions, even a little,  without using your husband as an emotional support pillow. This dynamic screams unhealthy and she needs serious medical care like yesterday. \n\nYou're NTA for telling her the truth but she clearly needs professional help. Please help her get it. This seems way outside your ability to handle.\n\nYour husband also deserves some peace and support too qnd shouldn't be forced to feel guilt in his remaining time. .", "NTA\n\nWhy is Jilly making this situation about herself? Why is she tormenting you and Jimmy with her problems when you two are the ones needing support right now?! How old is she?", "NTA but it's truly terrible that your husband's terminal illness and what little time he has left is being overwhelmed by this.  It's time to take a look at what is in his best interest for this time, for your best interest.   This shouldn't go on like this.  He needs space and calm.  The worst pain of her life?  No.  That needs to end,   This should be about him.  And you.  She comes in third.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It does beg the question of why she's still in that situation in the first place. \n\nIs Jilly in therapy? Does she have anyone else she can lean on besides you and your husband?

I wish the best for you and your family.", "NTA. Telling her was hard but a kind gesture overall. Jilly needs this time to process and I would highly suggest counselling if she isn\u2019t already. Speaking to specifically a grief councillor so she can start coming to terms with the reality and hopefully stop acting selfish and be more understanding and realistic that she is not being abandoned nor is she unloved.", "NTA. OP, I am so sorry for what you are going through. You and your husband sound like truly amazing people. \n\nAs for Jilly, I unfortunately can relate to what she is going through. I went through some personal trauma as well and ended up taking it out on the people I loved. I knew it was wrong, as I assume your neice knows deep down and that I was not truly being abandoned again. But, in the moment, it all feels so overwhelming and hopeless that you feel as though you can not control your emotions and you lash out. I can not tell you how guilty I feel and felt for the way I acted, and I've lost count of the number of times I have apologized. I am giving Jilly the benefit of the doubt for her actions and behavior, but I would recommend that she see a psychologist.

Honestly, I don\u2019t think it was doing her any favors. She already has a lot going on, I bet deep down she knew he was not going to make it in the long run. I don\u2019t think it was in her best interest to share that news with her, especially because she had made it clear.\n\nI am so sorry for her and your family. This must be so rough. I feel for her. I was a child in her shoes and didn\u2019t feel loved from my own family. I know how it feels like to be in her shoes. She is frustrated, frustrated at the world. I can only imagine how it feels to have the only male role model in her life whom she trusted slowly pass. I am truly so sorry. You both seem like you\u2019ve made her feel loved when she had nobody else to go to. I wonder what her home situation is like? Regardless, don\u2019t beat yourself up. It is clear you are trying your best. There is a lot on your place right now, as well as Jillys.

I lost my aunt to brain cancer as a 6 year old and the whole ordeal traumatized me for years. Thank goodness my mother was proactive and helped me through it.", "My assumption based on the language used by Jilly is that she is at least a teen, if not older. She says she loves her uncle, but her behavior shows very clearly that she only truly cares for herself. She doesn\u2019t care if his medical condition worsens as long as she gets what she wants. She doesn\u2019t care if hugging her causes him pain because cuddles are what SHE wants, so to hell with his feelings. She doesn\u2019t care if the nurses cannot treat him and make him comfortable because SHE wants to be on the bed. She asks him to sacrifice his medical care AMA because SHE doesn\u2019t like hospital rooms. She doesn\u2019t want him hooked up to medical equipment he needs so she can hug him for comfort. Not his comfort, her comfort. She doesn\u2019t care if her manipulative and hurtful words create stress and anxiety for her uncle in his final days, because if she\u2019s feeling stress then nobody else can have peace. She is creating friction in your marriage while you are no doubt dealing with anticipatory grief, and providing you with no support. Instead she is an additional emotional drain on you. Trauma or no trauma, she is a spoiled, selfish person with no boundaries, consideration or empathy for anyone else. NTA, and I am so sorry for what you are going through.", "Right - if she is anywhere close to adulthood someone needs to be getting this person some help and she might not be emotionally mature enough to receive this news.", "From context I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s (possibly) a minor but (based on wording) not a child (maybe teens).

It sucks that Jilly has had such a traumatic life up to this point, but the way she's dealing with it is only setting her up for more trauma. The stress of her reaction will be doing physical damage to your already dying husband, and that is your first priority.\n\nIf she is an adult, you need to insist that she see a therapist (if she's not already) to learn some actual coping skills. If she's a minor, recommend that to her parents/guardians/social worker. She hasn't learned any emotional regulation, and she needs to learn it now.\n\nHer response is incredibly narcissistic - the only thing she cares about is her. How unloved she will feel, how her uncle is dying just to leave her, how he shouldn't be getting treatment because hospitals scare her. That's not OK. I understand that trauma does make people unable to see beyond their own pain, but that doesn't mean she needs to stay that way. It's a harsh message that nothing in this world revolves around her, but it's one she needs to learn, in an age appropriate way.\n\nTell her that you both love her and dying doesn't change that, but the priority right now is your husband's health. Tell her you want her to be around him in his final months, but it cannot be in such a destructive way. And most importantly, please don't let yourself or your husband continue to be treated like her emotional support animals. It's not good for any of you.", "NAH. You leave out ages, only that you and jimmy are retired, but it sounds like Jilly has been going through a lot for a very very long time and you both were her only safe space.

You said she lived through traumatic events to the point that she needs to cuddle constantly, sees a man dying as an asshole move, perceives telling her the truth as living in a place where she's unloved, she's in complete denial to the point that she's an obstacle to professionals. \n\nThis is not something you can hug better. She needs therapy.", "NTA, OP. Jilly, no matter her age, needs therapy to help her process the grief of losing someone she lives. My sister had terminal cancer and passed away a few years ago. Her youngest child was 8, but even he understood her passing wasn't by choice. He's been in therapy to help process and cope with his grief, as has the rest of my sister's family. You're trying to prepare her. Just be there for her, as much as you can. Many hugs to all of you.", "INFO\nHow old is your niece? Because if she's any older than 10, she's way to old to be acting like this. To be honest, even a younger child should not be acting the way she is. She's unhinged and essentially abusing you psychologically (and your husband medically by not allowing him to receive proper medical care).\n\nListen, I'm sorry but this is not reasonable behaviour, this is not healthy for anyone involved, and what she needs is therapy, not cuddling. As is, everything was handled poorly. It's great that you could be her support network, but long ago this went from support to codependency, and this is not reasonable. The fact that she's even interfering with medical care is absolutely wrong and you both should have put a stop to it a long time ago. Close the door to your home if needed. Heck, make it a condition that she needs to go to therapy to have access to you. Pay for it. What if both of you had died suddenly? What would she have done? Deface your graves because you left her alone and then off herself? \n\nYou aren't assholes for telling her. But you have a massive issue you've never tackled and you need to make some boundaries and take some steps. Because there's no way she can function as an adult if she behaves like this. And the moment your husband goes, she's going to escalate with you even further.", "NAH. \n\nJilly hasn\u2019t been set up for success in the coping skills department, regardless of her age, and trauma rewires the brain in ways people who haven\u2019t experienced repeated events can\u2019t understand. \n\nNo, she\u2019s not acting appropriately. But she\u2019s also not acting with intent or rationality. And she\u2019s not making active choices, she\u2019s reacting to things that are happening to her. She needs a therapist to help her put coping strategies in place so she can stop lashing out like a wounded animal in times of pain. \n\nOP is a saint, not an AH. This is a lose/lose situation. \n\nDepending on the circumstances, it may have been kinder to not inform her of your husband\u2019s decline, as she requested. Let him make nice memories with her while he can, and when he\u2019s gone, tell her in a similarly gentle fashion. But the approach you took was the other side of the \u201cbest of two bad options\u201d coin, and there weren\u2019t many others, if any.", "Yeah, he\u2019s dying and he\u2019s having to expend his limited energy on her rather than himself. Unless this is a very young kid it\u2019s really weird.", "Thank You!! I was hoping someone would say this!!\n\nOP - you are NTA!! Your niece needs professional help!  If you have to and can, take legal action to get her the help she needs.  & At the same time please get the support you need as you go through the heartbreak of slowly losing your husband.\n\nI am praying for you all.", "It makes me worried that Jilly sees OP's home as her sole safe space. Why is her own home not a safe space? Are her parents unsafe for her to be around? Maybe that would explain why, even if she is older than 5, she behaves so juvenile.", "OP says Jilly has not only experienced severe trauma throughout her life, but also very recently, _before_ factoring in the trauma of a beloved family member being terminal. \n\nJilly\u2019s behavior literally just looks like a deeply traumatized person trying to cope when they haven\u2019t been set up with the skills. It\u2019s an NAH situation because it\u2019s completely lose/lose.\n\nEdit: Jilly autocorrected to Jolly, which is factually inaccurate to Jilly\u2019s mood", "Or, you know, traumatized. Trauma delays or even fully halts emotional growth.", "9-10 typically."]}
