Some important facts:\n\nHe\u2019s a superintendent so his new job offer requires him to live on site (which means we would be living in a new apartment building which is much nicer than where we currently live)\n\nWe currently live with a roommate and her cat which goes against the contract my partner has with his current employer. However, they are very relaxed and never noticed anything suspicious as she\u2019d been here since April 2022. She pays rents to my partner every month including parking access in our one parking spot. The car we have is parked in the guest lot (again, his current employer is pretty relaxed)\n\nNow with a potential new job, he wants to have her move into the extra bedroom (it\u2019s a two bedroom apartment but smaller than what we have now). This also goes against their contract and would put a lot at risk as they are more strict.\n\nI don\u2019t like the roommate and I also don\u2019t like her cat. Her cat sheds everywhere and cries every night. It\u2019s gotten so bad that no one can stay in the living room because there is cat hair everywhere! So it makes a common space unusable.\n\nI told my partner how I felt before I moved in with him in November and we both agreed to keep this current situation until November of this year. However, this new job offer has made our compromise potentially void.\n\nAm I the asshole for being so against having a roommate in our next place together? \n\nHe sees it as having a steady income of  up to $12,000 a year whereas I would rather be comfortable in our home than have that money.\n\nI\u2019m currently feeling depressed about this potential new place when it\u2019s supposed to be exciting. I have even considered telling my partner we can have a roommate as long as it\u2019s not the current one with her cat.\n\nPlease give me some outside perspective because I want my partner to be happy but I\u2019m afraid of compromising my happiness for this.", "created_utc": 1676468939, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112yeo1/aita_partner_31m_and_i_26f_are_possibly_moving/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also if the common area is filled with cat hair the roommate need to clean it up.

General curiosity.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is putting his job at risk by doing this\u2026it sounds like it\u2019s in his contract that he can\u2019t sublet a room. \nWhat happens if they find out?\nPart of his employment is to get a place to live, not to get a place and rent it out.", "INFO If subletting isn\u2019t allowed, what are his plans for when he gets reported and fired?", "NTA: Especially in a romantic relationship having a space that is your own is incredibly important and will feel great. For about three years my wife and I had one or two roommates. It did help with costs and helped our friends too. But it also caused a lot of grief. We never felt like they did their fair share of house work. It felt like pulling teeth to get funds for rent, utilities and food (they are whatever meals we cooked), etc. \nAfter the last lease ended we vowed to never have a roommate again. \nHaving a home and is our own is such a blessing. \n\nSo I can definitely side with you. Even without the annoying cat and poor cleaning up after that cat. It would be ideal. Having the extra annoyances is totally not worth it. \nMoney cannot beat peace of mind. \n\n\nAlso if he is being asked to live at the complex is rent free for you guys or super cheap? So there is no real need for roommate yeah?", "NTA but you aren\u2019t paying rent so you don\u2019t really get a say.  His apartment so he gets to decide.  And he likes the roommate and the $12k over your comfort.  You know it has the potential to end badly.  I personally wouldn\u2019t move with him - as a couple, you aren\u2019t a priority (which is his choice to make) and you won\u2019t like living in an even smaller space with roommate and cat.  Get your own place and find someone who prioritizes being a couple.", "You can have your feelings about it, but you don't have much leverage to demand anything here.  It's his employment contract he's risking, and you're not part of the \"lease\" for the place.\n\nNTA because it sounds like he agreed to separate from the roommate when you would move from the old place.

It is odd that he wants to keep living with someone you don't like too.\n\nIt is up to him to risk his job or not but he is also saying to you money is more important than making you comfortabke living with him. I would make okans to get your own place.", "NTA. I would suggest that you find your own place. Your BF is risking his job - and apartment! When (not if, but WHEN) they find out, he can be fired and/or evicted. You may not want to risk that!\n\nYou have valid concerns of a far higher level than the roommate's cat.", "NTA he could end up unemployed if they find out he is turning a profit on your apartment.

Is the issue the roommate or any roommate?\n\nAlso, this seems like a deal breaker, if it is, let him know you won't move in/continue relationship if he takes the roommate.", "I would say NTA for not wanting to have the woman and cat move with you. I think this is one of those moments where you need to decide is this a make or break situation. If you 100% do not want another roommate involved then you need to tell your boyfriend this and then stick to your guns which means not moving in with him and making your own arrangements. \n\nSet a clear line so he can make the decision.\n\nBut if you will complain but still move in either way then I think you have made your feelings clear already and he\u2019s choosing a different option that you will need to live with.", "NTA for wanting your home to be the way you want it to be.", "NTA. It'll be your home too.", "INFO: Is the issue having a roommate or having that specific roommate? The end of your post makes me think it's the latter.", "NTA. He\u2019s going to be found and then be unemployed and homeless. As a result, you\u2019ll be homeless *and* paying full rent on the next place for you two of you (or three of you).\n\nIf this is a dealbreaker, break up. If not, you\u2019ve only lived with him for a few months, so I would strongly consider moving back on your own before your become too financially and emotionally entangled. Tell him you\u2019re willing to move in with him only when you two have your own place. \n\nIf it\u2019s more about the potential of losing the place, I would state that because the situation is such an employment risk, unless his employer adds an addendum to the lease saying it is okay for a paying roommate to live with you, you\u2019re not moving in. They will obviously not allow this. \n\nHonestly I\u2019m also weirded out that he\u2019s determined to bring this woman along with him. I get it\u2019s a \u201cfree\u201d 12k but doesn\u2019t he want privacy when newly cohabiting? \n\nIf you do stay and have the roommate come along, I\u2019d be seriously saving money for rent when this inevitably goes up in flames.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he doesn\u2019t make your relationship a priority so maybe time to also reprioritize what\u2019s better for you instead of you nothing as a unit since he clearly isn\u2019t. That may mean moving to live alone and maybe even moving on from this relationship \n\nLife\u2019s too short to not be taken seriously by your partner in life. \n\nAlso because I\u2019ve been on Reddit for too long\u2014I having a small inkling that they\u2019re cheating. \n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this much of a problem to prioritize your comfort unless he\u2019s already stopped or never did. Either way, this isn\u2019t forever relationship material", "Thank you for your response! \n\nIt\u2019s part of his contract so he doesn\u2019t pay rent, it\u2019s part of his salary if that makes sense?

Op is NTA.", "Hi, I\u2019m not contributing to rent because there is no rent to be paid, it\u2019s part of his salary. I have offered to pay rent but he said the whole point is to have an outside source of income for us.", "Thank you for your comment. \n\nI do not want to break up however I will have to reconsider moving with him if he feels strongly about it. And thanks true, that\u2019s the most important part of all this too. I feel awful saying he\u2019s greedy because it\u2019s always nice to make money to support people you  are about but I have thought that myself. $12,000 (potentially) is a lot but is it enough for the risk? I don\u2019t think so.", "Hello, \n\nI\u2019ve offered to pay rent but he said he wouldn\u2019t take it as he wants outside income (because it\u2019s our combined money, it would just be moved between accounts) I do pay for all our groceries", "She is fully aware of the situation and chooses to be part of it. She knows the risks, etc. and she is the only person in our lives who would be comfortable with this arrangement.", "Hi,\n\nThank you for your comment. \n\nThis roommate we have is the only person who would be okay with our current agreement as she is a friend of his and he doesn\u2019t want strangers as roommates.

I would be much better if it was a different roommate but unfortunately this roommate is the only one we have that would be okay with this arrangement. I\u2019m also concerned about the potential  of his termination if this were to get figured out.", "Were you to be found by his employer, would this risk his job/the living situation?\n\nAlso, I would advice a serious talk between you two. Right now he is chosing his friend and some extra cash over your comfort in your own home and over the finantial security of your family. \n\nHow long does he intend to prolong this \"living situation\"? As long as he has this job?

If they are not supposed to have roommates or pets but are okay lying to the employer, definitely not agreeable.", "Then what he is doing is illegal. He is subletting part of his apartment against the terms of his lease/job contract. Is this extra income worth losing his job & housing over? NTA", "That\u2019s a fair arrangement. But no reason for you bf to complain", "yeah, I have a friend who recently went back to her BF. it's an incredibly unhealthy situation- for both of them honestly. but i felt like one of the reasons she went back was that when they live together she was an extra $2k to spend a month and she's gotten really used to that.", "Likely.\n\nSource - served on my condo board for 5 years, and we have similar contracts with our supers.\n\nviolating that is just like violating any other contract, except you lose your home and job in one easy step.\n\nIt's a terrible idea to play silly games with.\n\nNTA"]}
