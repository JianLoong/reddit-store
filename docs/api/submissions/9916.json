Which yeah i get it (I\u2019ve been in two accidents both totaling my car when I was 16) but I didn\u2019t buy it. In the past he\u2019s asked me to test drive it. I was never comfortable with anyone driving my cars especially now, and that it was always snowy. I would say a stern no and just leave it at that. \n\nYesterday my car was absolutely covered in dirty water mud. I am planning on washing it soon, but not until I know it will stay warm. I was over at boyfriends house getting ready to make food and boyfriends dad walks it.\n\nHe says he\u2019s going to get groceries and asked if I needed anything. I wanted cheese, but didn\u2019t need it. He said ok and asked if he could take my car. I said no and his response was \u201cwell I\u2019m buying your groceries i should be able to drive your car, and it has better gas mileage\u201d I said no and that he doesn\u2019t need to buy cheese. \n\nWhen he comes back he comes in with milk and snacks for the Super Bowl. He starts talking to me like casually ( we aren\u2019t close in any way shape or form) and says that my car is filthy. I told him that i knew and that i was waiting until it got warmer to wash my car.\n\nHe insists on taking my car to the car wash and paying for it. I declined because i just don\u2019t trust other people with something as valuable as a new car. He just got upset and told me to leave so i did. \n\nI think this is a weird situation.

I\u2019m sure he would not want your bf\u2019s dad driving it. Given your history with crashes, I think he picked a good car for you. It\u2019s not super fast but handles amazingly, and is pretty efficient and safe. Don\u2019t let anyone ruin this car for you, and certainly don\u2019t let anyone not insured behind the wheel. Maybe this will be the beginning of a passion for cars for you. I bet it\u2019s something you could share with your dad."]}
