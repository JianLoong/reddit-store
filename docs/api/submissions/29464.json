My husband and I chose to be child-free, allowing me time and resources to invest in activities with my honorary nieces and nephews. I'm passionate about outdoor activities, and I've passed this onto Nia, which her parents (who aren't outdoorsy) appreciate. They often encourage her to join me in these outings, seeing it as educational. It also gives them a day-long break when Nia and I go on an adventure. I've taken her hiking and rafting, I taught her how to swim, and I use these outings to teach her about things like safety and perseverence.\r  \n\r  \nWe all decided to vacation together in a tropical location. While I planned various activities with Nia like kayaking and a waterfall hike, I also had some advanced activities lined up for myself, including snorkeling. Given the inherent dangers of snorkeling, especially for children, I wasn't comfortable taking Nia with me. I've snorkeled before, but I don't believe I am capable of keeping her safe if she is swept away by a current.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, when Nia expressed interest in joining me for snorkeling, her parents quickly promised her that I'd take her, putting me in an awkward spot. I voiced my concerns, explaining the risks and my reluctance to watch over her in open waters. They were upset, arguing that I've taken her for other activities before, like bouldering and rafting. I countered by explaining how those situations were different, providing more control and safety. She can't float away while we're bouldering, and we've always rafted in gentle, shallow waters, with minimum 4 other adults in the raft. I never take her to do anything I think she couldn't handle or would put her in danger.\r  \n\r  \nI suggested they join if they wanted her to snorkel, but neither of them can swim. Despite my offer to teach, they declined. They said doing so would take away time from their vacation to do something they don't want to do. I had to break the news to Nia, who was understandably disappointed. Since then, her parents haven't spoken to me. \r  \n\r  \nTL;DR: During a vacation, my friend promised her daughter I'd take her snorkeling. I refused due to safety concerns, leading to tension between us.", "created_utc": 1697999540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17dzwn6/aita_for_not_taking_my_niece_snorkeling/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Additionally, it resulted in tension with her parents, who felt I should've spoken up before they made the promise. Considering I've taken Nia on various outdoor activities in the past, they might see this refusal as inconsistent or overly cautious, especially since they were relying on me for this activity. Their reaction made me question if I was being unnecessarily protective and if I should have tried harder to accommodate her interest in snorkeling.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You realize that these people expected you to entertain their child for them while they relax.  Why be friends with them?  What do you get from this?

Her parents have behaved quite badly.", "Nta wow they aren\u2019t good friends, they never should have made you tell her no. That was on them to do. Not to mention they should trust you and your judgment when you say no. I would perhaps let them cool off but you should expect an apology from them. I wouldn\u2019t let this go because not only were they being rude they also sound very ungrateful that you have had this relationship with their kid", "NTA at all. Regardless of the situation, a parent shouldn't try to push childcare on someone who isn't comfortable or confident.", "NTA. Nia's parents shouldn't have promised something on your behalf. That's AH-ish behaviour.

Friends do not use their children to emotionally blackmail their friends so that they don\u2019t have to do activities with their kids.
