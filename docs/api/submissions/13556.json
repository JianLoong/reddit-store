Two separate dances. The idea is to highlight the importance of those relationships. My sister's husband was a widower when she married her husband. He had two sons. Ben was 7 and Cole was 5. From the time my sister got married she called Ben and Cole her sons. She considered herself a mom from that point on and filled that role in the household even before she had her two daughters with her husband. Ben and Cole only ever called my sister by her first name and I don't think very many people outside my sister and her husband really thought they considered my sister to be their mom. Though I wouldn't say there was bad blood there either.\n\nBen's wedding is this summer and Ben has chosen to do the traditional dance with his maternal grandmother instead of my sister. My sister is hurt and angry about his decision to not do it with her. She was very, very upset. She called me and our other sister in tears. She was saying how much it hurts to be reminded that no matter how much you love them you are not mom and not even worth having a second dance for. We comforted her. Then she wanted to see us so we saw her the next day. She was still crying but she expressed way more anger than the first time. She was saying she'd skip the wedding and that her husband was planning to tell Ben he needed to do a dance with her as well. She started rambling, getting way too mean toward Ben and Cole's mom for my comfort, and so I got tough with her and told he she needed to stop reacting with so much anger. That Ben had the right to dance with someone who could represent his mom on the day and she needed to understand she could be at the wedding, his mom can't, that someone is missing from his wedding and she can't make that better for him. I told her if she truly loves him then she needs to accept that she's not their mom and be happy that they get along reasonably well.\n\nShe became more angry. She accused me of dismissing her feelings and minimizing what she's going through. She told me I was meant to support her not shit all over her. Our sister agreed with me and told her as much. But I suspect I only made the anger worse.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680174964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126jwti/aita_for_being_tough_on_my_sister_when_she_was/", "score": 361, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You didn't dismiss her feelings, you told her to stop dismissing her stepson's feelings. \n\nShe's certainly allowed to have her feelings hurt by this, but the fact that she's trying to force herself into the role tells a lot about why the stepson didn't want a dance with her. The more she tries to force it, the worse the relationship will become.", "NTA. \n\nHer attitude is exactly why she\u2019s not getting a dance.", "NTA. The feeling that she is his mother seems to be very one-sided. He doesn't seem to feel as close to her as she feels to him. Also, it is extremely bad form to speak ill of the dead. You called her out on her bad behavior, definitely NTA for that.", "NTA\n\nYou can't force a bond that just isn't there. He doesn't see her as a parent and he's been completely transparent about that the whole time she's been his stepmom. \n\nHer feelings are one thing. It's valid to feel hurt. But her actions? Nope, she's taking it way too far.", "NTA she\u2019s the worst kind of step mother.", "NTA. Your sister is way overstepping.", "NTA. She can't force what's not there.", "NTA\n\nShe's making his wedding about her.  It's not about her at all.  She might have raised him, but he's honoring his mother who cannot attend, not slighting her.  She needs to stop being jealous of a dead woman who is not a threat to her.  That's harsh, but true.  She needs to do something before she ruins things.  She's gonna ruin his wedding and possible her relationship with him and her husband.  \n\nYou're only looking at the big picture and warning her so she doesn't do that.  She is too consumed with jealousy that she can't see it herself.", "NTA. No one likes an evil stepmother, and that's what her stepson will view her as if she antagonizes his grandma.", "Your sister needs to chill the fuck out. It\u2019s a dance for Christ\u2019s sake. NTA.  I think it\u2019s lovely what\u2019s Bens doing, making sure his mums family stay involved.", "NTA - Her being hurt and upset is one thing, but to cause all this drama is another. Someone needed to tell her the truth.", "NTA. It was one thing for your sister to be disappointed by his decision, however, she is now making the entire wedding about her over one dance. It sounds like it is more important for her to be *seen* to be his maternal figure than to actually love and support him. \n\nYou were right to tell her to get over herself and to remind her that the wedding is not about her, if for no other reason than if she wants to have any relationship with her stepson going forward.", "NTA. She\u2019s allowed to have feelings about it. She should NOT share those feelings with her stepson, or expect stepson to change his wedding to manage those feelings.", "NTA, I think you handled it well. Has she tried considering that as you said his mom is gone, he may feel like bringing her into that position, not just in the wedding bit in life as you said he uses her first name etc. May just be because he feels if he did it would be somehow disrespecting his mom? She's kind of right it doesn't matter how much she does she isent his mom. And the flip is it doesn't matter how much he also loves and cares for her he still has a mother who is gone and that will always hurt so if he wants to dance with his grandmother to keep her part of it your sister should back off. The only way that decision reflects on her is if she keeps down this path and makes it a big ting because that makes her like terrible and will ruin their relationship", "NTA. It\u2019s okay for your sister to be hurt by not being chosen for the dance, she\u2019s a human being and she\u2019s cared for those boys since they were very young. I\u2019m sure she loves them very much and they love her too. However, she needs to be more understanding of him wanting to dance with his grandmother. Not attending the wedding or forcing him to dance with her as well is a bit much. Maybe if she talks to him about how this makes her feel he\u2019ll want to include her in some other way. Or maybe he won\u2019t.  \n\nI don\u2019t know how you said what you said to your sister, but what you said is not wrong. And hopefully when she can calm down a bit she will see that. Supporting someone doesn\u2019t mean telling them they are right all the time.", "NTA. I think it's beautiful that he has chosen his maternal grandmother to dance with and a wonderful way to honour his Mom.\nSis needs to respect the decision without seeing this as disrespect to herself. The day is not hers to rain upon. If she does she gets to be a complete AH.\n\nHopefully your tough love approach helps her see the light.", "NTA - You were merely trying to offer a reason from Ben's perspective which it doesn't sound like she was interested in hearing.", "NTA. Sister being upset is understandable. But she doesn't get to force her place in someone's life. This is probably step sones way of honoring his mother. She also doesn't get to make demands of someone else's wedding.", "NTA. Its the grooms final decision. Not hers. Sounds like he\u2019s always had a functional relationship with her, but not a close one. \n\nShe\u2019s acting toxic a/f and will ruin his entire wedding by insisting on being acknowledged in a way that she\u2019s not being perceived. And this will ultimately drive a wedge between him and his father. The groom sounds totally aware of what he wants and made his choice for a reason\u2026", "NTA\n\nyou said it all:\n\n*That Ben had the right to dance with someone who could represent his mom on the day and she needed to understand she could be at the wedding, his mom can't, that someone is missing from his wedding and she can't make that better for him.*\n\nI think it's wonderful that the son and mother of the deceased mom dance together in honor of the missing mom.\n\nStepmom is totally dismissing the feelings and wishes of the stepson. That's not loving your stepson, that's entitlement and lack of boundaries.", "Nta\n\nAnd thats why shes not getting a dance", "NTA you are actually being kind by trying to prevent her from ruining a decent relationship with someone she claims to love. The kind of actions she was proposing could permanently harm not only her relationship with the groom, but his father\u2019s relationship with him also.", "NAH\nI can only imagine how your sister must feel at this rejection, but you're also right that she needs to accept his decision.", "Am I the only one that doesn\u2019t think the sister is terrible? Who else do you express yourself to if not your sisters? I think she was in the moment and hurt, probably in a stage that didn\u2019t have much reasoning yet. It sounds human\n\nEdit-Since you guys are committed to misunderstanding this. I think the sister was right to bring her back to reality. I just was saying in the heat of emotion some people say things they don\u2019t mean. I didn\u2019t know it\u2019d be so controversial to say she\u2019s not a terrible person", "ESH\n\nLook, you don't get to tell her how to feel here. She spent DECADES of time, attention, money, and feelings on this kid, and he won't give her half of a 3 minute dance, or even an alternative \"thank you\" gesture.\n\nWere they in *any* other kind of relationship, we'd be calling it toxic, abusive, and telling her to cut him out and not give him another second. You want her to go full Giving Tree.\n\nThe stuff about him wanting to dance with grandma to acknowledge the person who's missing was good, as was trying to parse out the logic behind his choice in a reasonable manner. Trying to redirect her from being spitting mad to something more constructive was also excellent.\n\nBut the garbage about how \"if she *truly* loved him\" she'd just suck it up and let him hurt her without saying a thing was not helpful. Or welcome. And was pretty fucking demeaning. I doubt you would enjoy me telling you that if you *truly* loved your sister, you would shut up and nod along.\n\nBen is now a grown ass adult. If he makes decisions that piss off and alienate his two longest and most devoted allies, he should hear about the hurt he's causing and be warned before he sets fire to that bridge. If he fully knows what he's doing and *still* sets fire to that bridge, he's going to deserve whatever happens.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She doesn't seem to understand the groom's existence is independent from her marrying the groom's father. He wants to honor his mother because she is half of him. There is no replacing that.

You were 100% correct in everything you said. Even if her stepchildren love her, they lost their real bio mom. Even if they love their stepmother, it's normal they'd want to honor bio mom's memory by dancing with the grandmother who is a close living relative. She will make the relationship worse by trying to force herself into that position if they don't see it that way.

Sounds like you only did the latter part.", "She got even more angry bc you didn't agree with her, which is what she's looking for.  She wants someone else to validate her feelings.

In these situations, it is up to the kids to set the tone of what you are to them as long as you show them love and kindness. And especially if their mom was deceased, I would have wanted to help them remember and celebrate her.", "NTA  \nWhen will step parents realize that they can't just replace a parent like they never existed. These boys will always treasure the few memories they have of their mother. He has a relationship with his maternal grandmother & it is perfectly reasonable that he does the dance with her.  \nIf your sister understood this & supported him, they would probably have a closer relationship. I can only wonder how many times she has done something like this since she has been in his life. You told your sister the truth and she needed to hear it. I hope she learns something from it. You did a good thing!", "NTA. I don't think your sister doesn't get along with her stepson as well as you think.

It's Ben's wedding & Ben's decision. \n\nYou did the right thing, telling her it is Ben's choice to make. Choosing his grandmother is honoring his birth mother, not playing favorites.

Kudos to you for pointing out that a very major person to him, will be missing from this event. I would be too embarrassed to dance if I knew that the other person was forced.  I get it.  I am a step mom.  You do and do and do and lots of times, end up getting snubbed, but this! Most of us do from our hearts.  She cannot wish his mom away.  She should be thinking of other ways to honor his mom.   Your sister needs to be more compassionate to her step son, but I have a feeling that thats not in her nature.  I wonder how many times she has spoken poorly of his mom over the years.  Surely he knows.", "NTA. \n\nAnd I can see WHY the boys haven\u2019t considered her a mom. \n\nSounds like your sister doesn\u2019t like the repercussions of her own actions.", "NtAH and you are 100% right and did nothing wrong.  She is angry because she is not getting the - stand firm and demand the dance.  \n\nThese boys may like her, even love her, but she needs to realize that when you lose a parent - no one can take their place.  The son is having a tough enough time probably with the fact that his mother is not here to see him get married.  She needs to realize that this is about him, not her and she can be a mom, which means putting the child or in this case her step-son first.  That is what mother's do.  Things kids say and do at times hurts everyone.  But you just power through it when there is no right or wrong being done.  It is okay for him to want to dance with grandma and it does not make him value his stepmother less.  It hurts but it is true.  No winners here for sure.

Even if they went above and beyond as a friend, on no planet does that mean they are entitled to their friend returning their romantic feelings.\n\nShe acted as a stepmother should, maybe even went above and beyond, but that does not mean she is entitled to him feeling love for her as though she was a parent.

Whether or not she truly loves him, she should respect that.", "I agree with a lot of this. The kids never asked OP\u2019s sister to step in as a parent. You know who did? Their dad.

He\u2019s the one who should show thanks, not the kids.\n\nAlso, before AITA, I didn\u2019t know being a stepparent was the worst possible decision one could make in life.

I have step-siblings, half-siblings and adopted siblings and I love them all.  It was actually quite rewarding.  Most of my family is not related via DNA.  My uncle married my aunt who was a widower with 2 small kids.  They love my uncle as if he was their own and call him dad.  But they also post tributes to their biological father during holidays in memory of him.  He died of cancer and my uncle actually knew them both and was friends with both before he passed.  \n\nI have another uncle who gave me another cousin.  It is a lot like in-laws - it is what you make of it, and you need to understand that it is a blending but not an erasing of families.  Peeps who understand you blend not erase tend to have a better time of it.  Those who were need respected. They may have died, or they may be living - separately but they still existed/exist, and you cannot just replace them.  The trouble starts when people don't realize this.

She has been a mother figure since he was 7 and that is a *long* time. You didn't say that she treated the boys differently than the girls, only that the boys didn't think of her as mom. That probably really stings. She thinks of them as her sons not they don't think of her as mom despite everything she did for them. \n\nYou're her sister (brother?).

It doesn\u2019t change the fact that I would never be a stepparent to underage kids. Marry a man with grown kids? Sure, not a problem. It\u2019s mostly a thankless job.
