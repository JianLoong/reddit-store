Smoking meth is harmful physically and mentally, and could lead to legal ramifications. Her choosing not to wear her hijab isn\u2019t hurting anyone. You know what could hurt her? Exposing her to her family.

So you did not \u201cwitness\u201d anything that would be out of ordinary for someone who wears hijab.", "NTA. That's absolutely an unfair and uninformed comparison to make.

Doing something illegal and addictive compares to making religious choices?", "NTA\n\nI think you only need to tell parents about their kids behavior when it has to do with safety or is negatively impacting other kids. Her not wearing a head scarf only impacts her. Also, you only mention you and your daughter being around when she wasn't wearing her scarf. I had a roommate on a trip who was muslim, and she didn't cover her hair when it was just us in our room because we're both women, and she said she was only required to cover in front of men.

She\u2019s pretending to still be a vegetarian at home, and you\u2019re complicit in her duplicity. \n\nBut, it\u2019s also HER decision to make about her body.

I had a friend who grew up like this and her parents sent her to live with relatives and she came back married to a stranger at 18 when they found out she wasn\u2019t fully committed to wearing what they wanted her to wear.

Honestly, she'd likely get into trouble with her family and it could cause some drama between your daughter's friendship, and in turn, your daughter could get angry with you. Comparing it to smoking meth is a completely unfair excuse. This is about her religious attire, not illegal substances.", "NTA but why would your husband thing not wearing a hijab and smoking meth are in the same level. I would never tell on someone for not wearing their hijab.", "NTA.", "NTA, Do not inform her mother, it could cause some real harm", "One of those things is vastly different from the other! NTA", "Why did you marry a nincompoop?", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t know this woman. You don\u2019t know how she (or her husband) disciplines. Save the child. I don\u2019t know if her parents will find out from her or someone else, but it\u2019s her secret to tell.", " *...everyone in our home is free to believe what they want.*\n\n If that truly is the case, then, you should keep your lip zipped. Say nothing, to the mother. Your husband should also zip it.  I am also an atheist, who came from a very LDS family. I understand the girl's feelings. She feels safe, in your house. Claim ignorance, and say nothing. As long as you keep doing that, NTA.", "NTA. She\u2019s sixteen (or at least there abouts) and exploring what her religion means to her and how she wants to practice it. She\u2019s doing so in a safe environment in a very low stakes manner. Let her be and let her figure things out for herself.  It\u2019s her business and it doesn\u2019t harm anyone- including her. This is not anything at all like doing hard drugs as your husband compared it to. And honestly? That comparison is worrying to me. Any teenage rebellion is equated to terrible things? That\u2019s straight up weird. I imagine he went for hyperbole to prove some kind of point but still. He needs to recognize that he\u2019s comparing apples to orangutans here. \n\nLet her be. Let her figure it out for herself. Part of being a teenager is exploring who you are and what you want and what you hold to be important. Having a space where that can happen safely is a wonderful thing and taking it away is the opposite. There is no harm here. Just ignore it and let her figure it out. She isn\u2019t just someone\u2019s child. She\u2019s her own person rapidly approaching adulthood. Let her have some agency without setting her mother on her.", "NTA. Let's put all moral reasons aside for a minute and think of it like this: \n\nThose are *her* mother's rules, *in her mother's house.* Those are *not* the rules at your house. Her mother does not get to dictate what you allow in your own home. If her mother had a rule about taking shoes off before entering her home, and you did not, you would not force the girl to take her shoes off in your home just because she has to at her own house.\n\nI don't think it's your place to tattle to her mother, as your husband so illogically suggested. She'd doing nothing to harm herself and in my honest opinion, parents should have fuck all to do with a child's belief system in every way. They should merely be an unbiased guide to all roads of thought concerning spirituality and religion, and let the child decide what, if anything, they choose to believe.\n\nHere's what I think: IF her mother happens to find out some way, and confronts you angrily about it, I would just calmly state the facts: \"I'm quite positive every single parent on the planet parents a little bit differently. You never expressed to me your requirement that she must wear her hijab in my house- because, if you had, I would have told you that we do not force anyone to wear clothing that they don't want to in our home.\" Unfortunately at that point, the mother could choose not to allow her to go to your house, which is her prerogative, but also wrong and sad. Its a bit of a tough spot, for sure.\n\nAt the end of the day, let the kid be herself, as long as she's not hurting anyone or herself. Let her mom's (possible) future anger roll off your back, and know you're a safe space for this girl. Also (if you wanted to!) you could let her know that you'll continue to be one once she's an adult, if she ever needs one.", "NTA \n\nI\u2019m of middle eastern descent but born in North American, and if I was forced to fallow a religion with weird unfair rules, I\u2019d modify it to my liking as well because that\u2019s the freedom we get living in such a a diverse place. Let her make her own decisions and continue to be a safe place for her to express herself.", "NTA It's better to be a safe place than force the issue.  I thought they could remove the coverings in women only spaces.", "NTA. that\u2019s a cultural/religious issue between her and mother. I wouldn\u2019t want to get in the middle of something I know next to nothing about and she\u2019s not hurting anyone or herself. Depending on how things are in her household, you could become a safe haven in the future, someone else she could trust. \n\nMeth is no comparison to headscarf", "EXACTLY. She deserves having some people she feels safe with that isn't family. If they tell her parents she isn't always covered they'll destroy that. Her parents will likely decide it's the friend being a bad influence and take her out of school or she herself will stop being friends with their daughter because the daughter's parents betrayed her. It's also frankly none of her business or her husband's how the girl practices her modesty.", "I feel this could almost be a good usage of weaponized ignorance. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know she was supposed to be wearing it. We didn\u2019t think we should interfere with a culture that\u2019s not ours\u201c Etc\u2026  \n\nIt would be one thing if the friend\u2019s mother had asked them to police her daughter\u2019s headwear. She hasn\u2019t, so no need to mention it at all. \n\nIf the mother does ask them to do so, or even just asks if her daughter has been wearing her headscarf at their house, that\u2019s a more difficult needle to thread.", "IKR? One is inhaling an illegal addictive drug and the other is, uh, showing her knees. \n\nNTA", "I\u2019m glad I read your comment bc TWICE I read AITA for telling and totally skipped over the not. It made me go back and reread a third time. \n\nDefinitely NTA and totally agree it\u2019s not the same comparison.", "I wouldn't even rat out the smoker lol", "This. ^^ You have the correct approach, OP. \n\nI try not to involve myself in matters that don\u2019t concern me, and the intricacies of how or whether someone else practices their religion are, with limited exceptions, not my concern.", "YES, wearing hijab or any covering is not required when at home, with close family or with other women. Even if she was trying to follow religious practices, she's doing just that at your home with her female friend. \n\nIf she doesn't want to follow everything, that's between her and her family anyway. \n\nSource: A super duper atheist married to a Muslim man.", "Yeah I was going to say this. It\u2019s a headscarf, not a Mandalorian helmet.", "Extremely!!!", "this", "Agreed", "Somehow I want this on a t-shirt.", "Not in as many ways as they should be.", "Are they though? Religion is the opiate of the masses... Seriously though, husband is an idiot for using meth as a comparison.", "It sounds like she\u2019s also not wearing it around OP\u2019s husband though which wouldn\u2019t be allowed. Regardless, I agree with letting the kid make her own choice and not outing her.", "This is the answer.", "Agree completely. \n\nNTA", "My son was home with them, but my husband wasn't.", "Why does it matter if they were around? She has autonomy", "Your vote and your comment don\u2019t seem to match.", "I think you meant NTA?", "Exactly! That poor girl could end up sent to another country and married off!\n\nThe Dad has no clue about the danger.", "Exactly this - in their culture rule breaking is oftentimes dealt with very harshly", "I hope she shows him this post-", "I don't think it'd be right to do that either. So far I've just said nothing any time she's come over and that's worked fine.", ">If they find out that you knew, your daughter will lose the time with her friend because that mom will more than likely veto future visits to your house\n\nIf OP tells mom, mom might decide OP's daughters a bad influence and cut off contact anyway. Or she might harshly punish the friend. I think it's safer for the child to let it go.", "And if the rule was \"don't be gay\" or \"boys aren't allowed to wear skirts\"? 16 is when kids are trying things out, figuring out who they want to be and how they want to interact with the world. If OP can provide a safe place for her daughter's friend to do that, that's an amazing gift to give her. The only time other adults should be ratting kids out to their parents is if they are endangering themselves or others by their behaviour. OP is NTA, but you very well might be.", "No she can choose to not be forced to practice any specific way right now. I do not understand people like you who treat children like property.", "She has autonomy, religion is a choice", "\"Given by her parents\" doesn't automatically mean it's a good rule, and rules that take girls' bodily autonomy in the name of religion are not good rules.", "This is an absolutely awful take. Just because it's a rule doesn't mean it's fair or ethical. She's old enough to make her own choices about religion and she's obviously scared of her parents. Please don't have kids.", "I would so not appreciate being asked to police someone else's kid in this situation, especially when the kid in question is 16 years old. It's not like they're doing drugs or anything illegal. I have slightly older kids and my house was always where the high school kids liked to hang out. It was their \"safe place.\" No judgement, no policing their religious beliefs or clothing. \n\nIt's def  a tough situation for OP! I wouldn't want to be be in OP's shoes! :-)", "That\u2019s easy - \u201coh, I haven\u2019t paid that much attention to what she\u2019s been wearing, they go right up to my daughter\u2019s bedroom\u2026 She\u2019s wearing it when you pick her up, right?", "LMAO!!!", "lol!! I'm glad you read it twice, as well! :-)", "This is the way", "Lol right", "In your analogy, they should be calling CPS then.", "Was the son in the room with them?", "You don't understand their comment then because it makes perfect sense. Her child's friend is not her child to police. Her child's friend is making her own choices and the OP is NTA for staying out of it.", "I agree with how you've been handling it.", "That\u2019s perfectly understandable. I don\u2019t know the ins and outs of the religion anyways, from other comments it sounds like she\u2019s not doing anything wrong from that standpoint. Stay a safe place for her to be herself, and be glad your kid keeps open communication with you, that\u2019s great! And please explain to your husband that doing drugs is NOT even remotely close to not wearing a headscarf lol. The girl\u2019s obviously feels comfortable around you and your family, and I think that\u2019s awesome. If the mother eventually comes to you with questions about it then it\u2019s a different thing, but not really.", "Or cut off her head or genitalia... let's stop pretending that enforcing gender discrimination under the flimsy umbrella of culture or religion makes it okay.", "I straight up wouldn\u2019t do it. But I can easily say that from the position of not having to deal with it in reality. \n\nTrying to do right by both of these young girls, one of which you have no authority over must suck.", "Isn't the main \"reason\" for wearing a headscarf and long pants so males outside of her immediate family can't see her body? If the daughter's friend was up in her room and only the daughter and her mother saw her, would this be considered a major breach?", "This is the way.", "That's Karl Marx, not mine.", "It doesn't matter.\n\nThe kid didn't want to wear it. Thats all that matters.", "He's young enough that it may not matter", "Lol I think it was edited because initially it started with \u201cYTA.\u201d", "Seriously", "Don't they have to cover around sons, as well? Just not husbands? Maybe I was misinformed.", "I'm just curious if OP's husband could be calmed down with some information", "Oh, I didn't know that could be a thing. Thank you!", "Damn, I thought it used to say edited if they did that...", "I commented when the post was 2 minutes old so it could have been a ninja edit."]}
