Right now she sees your home and your daughter\u2019s friendship as her safe space, and I wouldn\u2019t want to jeopardize that.", "NTA - It isn\u2019t the same thing. Smoking meth is harmful physically and mentally, and could lead to legal ramifications. Her choosing not to wear her hijab isn\u2019t hurting anyone. You know what could hurt her? Exposing her to her family.

So you did not \u201cwitness\u201d anything that would be out of ordinary for someone who wears hijab.", "NTA. That's absolutely an unfair and uninformed comparison to make.

Doing something illegal and addictive compares to making religious choices?", "NTA\n\nI think you only need to tell parents about their kids behavior when it has to do with safety or is negatively impacting other kids. Her not wearing a head scarf only impacts her. Also, you only mention you and your daughter being around when she wasn't wearing her scarf. I had a roommate on a trip who was muslim, and she didn't cover her hair when it was just us in our room because we're both women, and she said she was only required to cover in front of men.

She\u2019s pretending to still be a vegetarian at home, and you\u2019re complicit in her duplicity. \n\nBut, it\u2019s also HER decision to make about her body.

I had a friend who grew up like this and her parents sent her to live with relatives and she came back married to a stranger at 18 when they found out she wasn\u2019t fully committed to wearing what they wanted her to wear.
