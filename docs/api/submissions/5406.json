She asked me to send her the menu and I did.\n\nShe said she did not feel comfortable with Josh eating there as the food there was very unhealthy and she did not see any options she would be ok with Josh eating, she said that she would send a healthy packed lunch for Josh to eat while me and Danny ate the food from the restaurant.\n\nI explained that I was sorry but no, I was not ok with that, as I thought it would be unfair on Josh to watch his older cousin eating lots of nicer food while Danny had to have a packed lunch, and that I also did not think it would be fair to cancel our normal plans.\n\nEmma told me to stop being rude about her food and that it was not her fault myself and Danny's parents allowed him to eat unhealthy food. James also got involved saying I already agreed and I should respect his wife's wishes, I said I was sorry but I can either watch Josh and take him to have a nice lunch with his cousin or I would not take him at all.\n\nJust to confirm there is no medical reason for Josh's diet,  Emma is very serious about health and fitness and at family events she is normally very strict about what she will eat and allow Josh to eat, I have also seen her be quite controlling about James' diet, but I assumed she would make an exception her son to have one meal with his cousin, but maybe I am being too judgmental, I just feel these rules are unreasonable and pretty harsh, and I do not want to enforce them.\n\nSo, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1671749995, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zszjnb/aita_for_refusing_to_take_my_nephew_out_unless_he/", "score": 237, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Having the child watch you both eating at the restaurant is ridiculous.", "NTA. First, you're absolutely right that you can't treat one child and not the other. That's a recipe for all kinds of resentment. Second you're entitled to stick to your plans. If Emma doesn't want her child participating in those plans, she's essentially forced your hand\u2014you simply can't take Josh.", "NTA. If I'm understanding correctly she was asking that you bring along outside food to the restaurant for Josh which a lot of places wouldn't even allow. If she doesn't want her son to even have one less healthy meal a week that is her call, but then she should have just accepted that the arrangement wasn't going to work out rather than demanding you make unreasonable accommodations.", "NTA. You would be the AH though if you forced one boy to sit there with his carrot sticks or whatever while his cousin had a treat. It's not like you do this every day and try to undermine a healthy diet.", "NTA that is some next level controlling behavior. Good for you for pointing out how weird it is for a kid not to have one unhealthy meal. Don\u2019t give in or you\u2019re tacitly supporting it. \n\nThe poor child.", "I'm going to say NTA. \n\nYes, sure, she can decide what he eats as his parent. But she IS going to give that boy a fucking eating disorder or something. I have personal experience with people like her (my mother is a nutritionist and gave me a lot of shame and baggage about food to deal with, and I have encountered SO MANY of these \"crunchy\" (whatever TF that means I see it used on FB) fitness moms who are OBSESSSED with not feeding their children \"bad\" foods... It's like \"How to give your child trauma around food and their body 101\".", "NTA. Speaking as the (fat) kid who had the \u201chealthy food\u201d (or no food at all) and just had to watch everyone else in my after school group eat the tasty food. Would loved to have not been subjected to that, thanks.", "NTA. \n\nParent here. She\u2019s going to give that kid an eating disorder. Moderation is key!!!!\n\nIt\u2019s a once a week thing. She\u2019s being incredibly controlling. If the kid was 2-4 I would say that was fine\u2026 but at 7 you\u2019re exposed to all the other kids at school and know what kinds of foods are out there. Without showing him he\u2019s capable of making his own choices he can\u2019t get the positive feedback from her that would actually reinforce her beliefs. Meaning, go over the menu with the kid and ask him if he can choose the healthy things on this menu. Then let him go to lunch. When he returns hopefully he\u2019ll have chosen at least one healthy thing that he can say \u201cmom! I chose healthy\u201d And then she can praise him and he\u2019ll feel validated for that choice. \n\nBy saying no she\u2019s just making him want to disobey her. You have to give kids a chance to make good choices on their own and this is the perfect opportunity. There\u2019s literally no danger.", "NTA because if you do go to the waffle place the kid would just watch as you eat yummy junk food. I say this as the former kid who had healthy lunches packed, it was hurtful to watch people eat what you want to eat and made me have a very unhealthy relationship with food later in life (which according to my nutritionist and therapist is very common with people who have strict diets growing up)", "Nta.....7 days in the week kid eats healthy if she can't let him have one off day that sucks. Just tell.her you can't do it and be done with it", "NTA.\n\nMomma's being too controlling and frankly rude to make the kid eat a bagged lunch while you guys are dining out (let alone the etiquette of bringing food to a restaurant)", "NTA, eating disorder incoming for this kid thanks to mom", "Nta \n\nYou literally can\u2019t take outside food into a restaurant \n\nAlso, every parent I know who has been super strict on food with tweens has overweight teens. \n\nWe\u2019ve always gone \u2018balanced diet\u2019. I have two low to average sized pre teen and teens.", "NTA. You're doing them a favor by watching your nephew and going above and beyond by taking him out to eat. Where you said there are no health or dietary restrictions, I'd have done the same. My mom was also very strict about sugar,  any type of sweets and somehow ketchup and orange juice when I was growing up so of course whenever I went to a friend's house I would jump at the chance to try a forbidden sugary breakfast cereal and was addicted to orange juice for years once I finally tried it.", "NTA While she is the mother and it is up to her to determine what her son eats.. it really wouldn't be fair on him to sit there and eat a pre packed healthy meal made by her while you're at the restaurant indulging in the most likely tastier thing. (yes I know healthy food can be tasty too, but be real. It's never as tasty) \n\nAlso this is assuming the restaurant even allows outside food....  ehhh this is a tough one... you did also agree to watch him already....", "Your SIL is if she hasn't already set her son up for a very unhealthy relationship with food, and IMO she [and your brother] are both major AHs.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA - plus it would set the tone for any future times when you\u2019re watching her son. She would just expect this to be the norm if you agreed this time.", "NTA\n\nYou have the right to not take your nephew and certainly the right not to alter plans. It would be ludicrous for a 6 year old not to have a melt down if not allowed to eat the much more fun food and I doubt the restaurant will be happy to have a kid eating a meal brought in.\n\nAlso your sister is beyond controlling. A neighborhood waffle place is not \"junk food\" by any definition unless someone has real issues with gluten and even then most places now have gluten free alternatives. If the kid isn't allowed to eat waffles, the poor kid's diet is super restrictive and the odds are that as soon as the kid is in a position to not be completely controlled, they will go the other way in terms of eating habits.\n\nI completely understand why anyone wants their kids to eat mostly \"healthy\" foods but what you eat for one meal makes no difference and generally prevents disordered eating in the future if no food is \"demonized\".   \n\n\nDoes she not allow the kid to have a cookie or birthday cake? What about ice cream if they go to the beach?", "Nta but because in my experience, I doubt the restaurant would be pleased with a full packed meal for a 7-year-old. (Cheerios, applesauce, whatnot for babies or toddlers is generally okay in family friendly places, but that\u2019s about it in terms of outside food.) The restaurant might tell you to put the food away or leave. I wouldn\u2019t want to risk that drama. So you basically are left with the choice between your weekly waffle tradition with one nephew or accommodating the diet of the other. Doubt it would help to it explain it that way to people demanding childcare from you, but at least it gives you another talking point!", "I read the ages wrong so deleted and reposting.   There is no way the boy wouldn't be upset about eating different food leaving you to deal w it. Plus restaurants generally don't allow outside food.  NTA she is on the path to make her kid have real food issues.", "NTA; you shouldn\u2019t have to alter standing plans when they asked YOU to take him along. It puts the kid in a super awkward position. While it wouldn\u2019t  be the worst thing to find alternate plans but it seems entitled for them to demand it.", "NTA; you\u2019ve been put in an akward situation and have taken the path with the smallest number of possible negative outcomes for all parties (within the extent to which you can control.)\n\n(Plus I doubt the wafflehouse would take too kindly to someone bringing in a packed lunch for a child clearly old enough to order and eat from their menu.)", "NTA, but if she wants you to be an AH, charge her for watching the kid. You're spending quality time with your nephew, and it's one meal (depending on if this is a weekly occurrence). \n\nEven so, she could compromise for the kids sake. One crappy waffle and a diluted cup of OJ. sheesh", "nta you are totally right. I mean yeah she can control what her son is eating and I think you also get that unhealthy food is bad. But it is a fact that her child is going to feel left out or maybe he doesn't even understand why his cousin is treated different (or better prob in his opinion) than him :( \nThis is not a matter of unhealthy food - This is a matter of different treatment between two children and he will maybe hate his mom if she denies him like this (how is it going to be in school when all his friends are having unhealthy lunch e.g.)", "NTA- one meal isn't going to make the nephew unhealthy and I don't think restaurants are happy when customers bring their own food into their establishment. \n\nShe doesn't like the terms she needs to look for another sitter.", "NTA.  Waffle House?  \n\nAllowing junk food/ fast food in limited amounts is not going to kill someone.", "You invited your nephew (well mom did) to join    YOUR Wednesday tradition, take it as is or leave it. That is her choice.", "Easy NTA, having a kid eat a packed lunch in a restaurant while everybody else has restaurant food is plain cruel.\n\nI think in general aunts and uncles are free to disregard the wants of parents anyway. The whole point of aunts and uncles is to feed kids ice cream and espresso then return them to their parents.", "NTA - besides the fact that bringing a packed lunch into a restaurant is rude and possibly not allowed, that would really stink for a 6 yr old to watch his cousins eat super yummy food while he eats carrot sticks. As an adult that would suck! Lol If they can\u2019t loosen up for 1 meal than they can take care of their kid.", "I was that kid whose parent packed \u201cweird\u201dlunches for me to take everywhere and had various food restrictions throughout my childhood. \n\nMy mom went through phases. For years we were vegan, or no sugar, or salads three times a day. Worst period was middle school when she self diagnosed me with celiac and forced me on a gluten free diet because \u201cwheat makes you angry.\u201d I\u2019ll never forget having to eat mushy rice pasta at a church campout while the other kids laughed at me and the counselors bitched about having to cook a separate meal because of my controlling mom. \n\nOnce I got a job and a car I started eating whatever I could that had been banned from my life and hiding it in my room. I\u2019ve struggled with binge eating and a lot of repressed emotions regarding food and diets ever since. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t \u201chealthy\u201d it was abusive and controlling. It isolated me from my peers and I had to deal with my mom forcing her warped views and disordered eating on me from childhood. \n\nI feel really bad for this kid. Makes me remember the times my awesome cousins would sneak me cold kfc because they felt so bad I wasn\u2019t allowed to eat chicken.", "NTA. However, people are gonna be split on this just because ppl have contradicting views on what is correct  parenting and what falls within a person's rights to do/say to another person's child. Personally, I think parents micromanaging their kids diet is so insane, it's borderline comical. And makes me feel really bad for their kids. I truly don't think it teaches what their parents are hoping it does. So good luck! Keep up the waffle tradition. I would've loved that as a kid.", "NTA. It\u2019s extremely rude to being in a packed lunch to a restaurant\u2026plus with these habits, she\u2019s going to give her son a major complex about food. Let the kid live a little! I mean no waffles? Jesus.", "NTA\n\nYou are doing her a favor, I would not  to treat one kid to yummy food while making his cousin eat rabbit food.  She is asking a lot to of you.", "NTA wasn't sure to begin with but it does seem like she's seriously inflexible. If you're doing a favour and not feeding him something insane it seems reasonable he can have a treat meal or they can find someone else to watch him", "NTA. Emma was already imposing on you by asking you to watch her son. She wanted to further impose by either changing your routine completely or forcing her son to watch while you ate. Then Emma doubled down and called *you* rude? That's not how agreements work.", "NTA. It's unfair, in my opinion, that the kid have his diet controlled. Kids should be able to try everything and have likes and dislikes. I feel like the one thing she could do is just tell him that he can eat junk food, just not a lot.", "NTA - And I find it ironic that parents like Emma don't realize they're just putting their kid at a higher risk of developing an eating disorder.", "These kinds of zealot parents drive me nuts.  When my kids were little there was always this one parent who's son had no medical issues, but he wasn't allowed birthday cake or a cookie at Christmas because his mom wanted to go on the anti sugar crusade.\n\nYour sil is on a power trip...It's a waffle ffs....  Nta", "I'm gonna say NAH - you're both communicating well and setting clear expectations.  You aren't going to agree on it, but I don't think there's anyone being overly unreasonable here. \n\nYou're completely in the right to set the expectations you have, and they're completely in the right to disagree with those.  Your out is appropriate - they don't have to send their kid with you.", "I would have agreed and then taken him to the restaurant anyway. She's preparing that kid for a lifetime of horrible relationships with food. NTA.", "NTA. You have an established routine that you like.  She wants to interrupt your routine. I would straight up tell her that if your nephew is with you, you'll let him eat what he wants (since it's not dangerous, like an allergy or diabetes). I would not want to enforce  her rules and watch the poor kid watching me eat waffles. If she doesn't like it, she can find someone else.", "NTA.\n\nMother has every right to say what her child can or cannot eat but then again OP also has every right whether to take the child or not with given restrictions. They weren\u2019t mentioned when asked so he can change his mind \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "NTA. All of your points are valid, but I\u2019ll also add it is probably against the policy of the restaurant to allow outside food (and if it isn\u2019t it\u2019s still incredibly disrespectful to the establishment)", "NTA. \n\nYou have a standing lunch with your other nephew.  And it would be super awkward to have him sitting there eating carrots and celery.  That is putting you in such a shitty position, I don't blame you for not wanting to.", "NTA. I am assuming that they 1. Don't pay you to look after their child and 2. would not be paying for the child's food.  \n\nFeel sorry for that kid though, expecting your child to be taken to a restaurant but can't eat the food while they watch their cousin eat is a nasty thing to do to the kid. Something tells me that kid is going to have a very complicated relationship with food in the future.", "NTA and you did a great job. You could have lied and taken him and fed him the waffles anyway, potentially undermining mom, but instead you acknowledged her requirements and straightforwardly refused them.  Totally reasonable refusal and well handled. Good job uncle.", "Difficult. NAH, I guess.", "Tough one. NAH. I think the parents\u2019 concerns are valid. It\u2019s their right to say no junk food allowed. But I can appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do as well. You\u2019re offering to watch the boys and creating special memories at your Wednesday lunches. Is there a breakfast spot that has options everyone can live with? Danny can get his waffles and josh can have\u2026scrambled egg whites?", " After debating with the fact that she is willing to pack him a healthy lunch and not demanding u to find a healtier place to eat instead, maybe a light yta. But taking the restaurant into consideration maybe nta. Most places near me don't allow outside food and you are watching their child as a favor and you dont do it often and a little splurging doesnt hurt the child.", "YTA. You as a babysitter do not get to dictate the diet of the child you are watching. I don't necessarily agree with her pushing the health food on her child, just sheerly because it's been proven to be counterproductive, but I'm not Josh's parent and it's not my place to make those decisions for him. You aren't under any obligation to watch him, but going back on you agreeing to watch him because you can't undermine her parenting by letting him pig on unhealthy foods is petty and honestly sounds controlling. He isn't your child. You have to respect the parent's wishes. Especially if she's providing alternative food for him. She's not asking you to go out of your way at all.", "Yep YTA. You don't get to decide the diet of someone else's kid. Just change your plans.", "YTA (but, only mildly)\n\nEmma is Josh's mother and she has every right to decide what he may and may not eat. You have zero right to go against parents' rules for their children.\n\nYou are not obligated to watch Josh and you are allowed to feel uncomfortable with the situation. That said, your unwillingness to adjust your regular plans with Danny to accommodate spending shared time with both of your nephews kinda makes you an asshole on this one. If this were going to become a regular thing, the polite thing to do would be to refuse and say that you aren't able to take both of them every week. You can do something different for one day so that Josh doesn't feel left out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Parents kid... Parents rules. Its a total asshole move to say \"if I can't feed your kid saturated fats and empty calories he's not good enough to be in my care\" yet... You're the same people who a few months ago ripped apart the lady who gave her sons friend halloween candy after the mom said no. \n\nDouble standard much??", "She didn't undermind the parents. She changed her mind once she was no longer comfortable with the arrangement. Undermining them would have been agreeing and then feeding the kid waffles.", "It isn't your place to agree but it is your place to decide if you want to continue with the plan given the restrictions or not.", "It\u2019s a fairly common policy in restaurants and very reasonable to assume that they don\u2019t want outside food brought in for both monetary and hygenine purposes (with obvious exceptions for things like baby food.)", "Okay and the kid doesn\u2019t have to go with OP, like OP said?", "No they\u2019re dictating whether the child comes with them or not.", "Do you not understand how miserable it would be to sit there and watch someone eat while you have to eat a packed lunch? It\u2019s a fun tradition she has with her other nephew. The parents are the ones who asked, not her.", "Exactly. OP stated nephew #2 can't be with her unless she can feed him crap food. That's an AH move. Period.", "According to whom? How do you know nephew #2 will even give a shit? Maybe he likes his healthy food. Maybe he's never had waffles and won't care? Maybe he doesn't like waffles? Maybe he would care more he can hang with his cousin and aunt over a 20 minute meal?", "They already have plans and it\u2019s a thing they do every week. I\u2019m a parent and I couldn\u2019t imagine having the audacity to act like this."]}
