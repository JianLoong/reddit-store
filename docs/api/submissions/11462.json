Ever since we've been together I've worked in a different state and come home on my week off. I love my job and make really good money that allows me to help support my family. I've always been very close with my family so it feels great to be able to pay back all support given to me during my years of struggling. I'm gone for 2 weeks at a time and home for a whole week off. I love my schedule and I think the work I do is really fun.\n\n After our 1 year anniversary my girlfriend has changed a little bit and has been asking more about our future and settling down. I told her I want to stay at my job, save money to buy a house eventually. She's been telling me that being away for 2 weeks at a time is really hard for her and that I should find something in town. I told her I'll look for something in the same feild but it's a lot harder to in our area to find. I've been searching the past 2 months and I haven't been able to find open positions for my kind of job anywhere within 200 miles. She's been getting really impatient and more and more confrontational everytime I go back to work. She's been telling me If I can't find something in my feild I should just find something else to do for a living. I'm not college educated and I only have years of experience in this one feild so if I switch I'm right back to barely being able to support myself.\n\n This last time I was going back to work we got into an argument about me leaving and she told me I need to figure it out soon because this is too hard for her. I finally snapped and told her she needs to suck it up or just travel with me out of town because I'm not quitting my job, stop helping support my family, and surviving paycheck to paycheck just to make her happy. I'm making sacrifices in my present to help build my future and our future if she still wants to be a part of it. She ended up calling me an asshole and that I care about money more than our relationship.

Being what is as close to a single parent without actually being one is hard. Being responsible for every single thing alone for 2 weeks, then only getting 1 weeks respite is hard. On top of that you will have a hard time because there will be an entirely different routine when you are home. Do you come home now and expect her to continue being responsible for the cleaning and cooking, or do you participate 50% when you are home? Do you slack off at home, or do you support her needs and desires? She is supporting your decision to work away from home as best she can and is telling you she can't anymore.
