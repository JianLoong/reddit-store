Ever since we've been together I've worked in a different state and come home on my week off. I love my job and make really good money that allows me to help support my family. I've always been very close with my family so it feels great to be able to pay back all support given to me during my years of struggling. I'm gone for 2 weeks at a time and home for a whole week off. I love my schedule and I think the work I do is really fun.\n\n After our 1 year anniversary my girlfriend has changed a little bit and has been asking more about our future and settling down. I told her I want to stay at my job, save money to buy a house eventually. She's been telling me that being away for 2 weeks at a time is really hard for her and that I should find something in town. I told her I'll look for something in the same feild but it's a lot harder to in our area to find. I've been searching the past 2 months and I haven't been able to find open positions for my kind of job anywhere within 200 miles. She's been getting really impatient and more and more confrontational everytime I go back to work. She's been telling me If I can't find something in my feild I should just find something else to do for a living. I'm not college educated and I only have years of experience in this one feild so if I switch I'm right back to barely being able to support myself.\n\n This last time I was going back to work we got into an argument about me leaving and she told me I need to figure it out soon because this is too hard for her. I finally snapped and told her she needs to suck it up or just travel with me out of town because I'm not quitting my job, stop helping support my family, and surviving paycheck to paycheck just to make her happy. I'm making sacrifices in my present to help build my future and our future if she still wants to be a part of it. She ended up calling me an asshole and that I care about money more than our relationship.

That sucks.", "NTA... Lets be real for a second, you have been with her for one year and shes struggling hard. It takes a very certain type of person who can handle a work schedule like that. (Think about military and other related jobs where SOs are gone for extended periods of time). unfortunately not everyone can handle it and she doesn't seem to be in that camp.\n\nAnyway, I think your suggestion of \"come with me\" is a good one, you all could possibly think about moving to where you work and visiting home on your off weeks that way you are together more often then not. \n\nOn a separate note be careful with \"supporting your family\" if they need the support it's a good thing to do but you also don't want to be financially responsible for them for an extended period of time otherwise your life will get harder.

You want different things. It is time to part ways. You should not have to return home just to get shat on. You both are young and can find a more suitable partner.", "NTA. She is the one who needs to figure out if she can deal with your schedule or not. There are few opportunities to do things you enjoy and get paid to do it. Keep doing what makes you happy. At 23, there is no reason to rush into settling down. You are just starting your journey. Sometimes, you have to leave someone behind.", "NTA why can\u2019t you both work where you work?", "Nta. Your looking out for your future, that is what you're supposed to be doing at your age. It's time for a serious sit down talk with your girlfriend to get on the same page.", "NTA.

It's unfair of her to ask you to switch jobs just like that.\nI get that she must be struggling and she most definitely misses you while you're away but you're trying to build your future.\nShe going with you seems like a good compromise actually. And a more reasonable one", "NTA. Has she volunteered to uproot her life and move near your work? If it was a problem for her, she should never have continued dating you.

You\u2019re lucky to have a gig that allows you financial stability in and of itself, doubly so if you make enough to help out with your family.

She needs to be more supportive", "Nta.  I'm surprised you have not moved closer to your job. Maybe that's what she shouldn't be considering as well is moving closer to your job since you're making a lot of money at this place and will not be able to have the same lifestyle if you took a lesser paying job around the home base area", "NTA she is being a brat.  Partners support each other.  For the first 4 years of my marriage my husband was gone 2 weeks cross country and working locally two weeks so he was gone 26 weeks out of the year.  I leaned into my career, spent time with friends and remodeled the house to keep myself entertained when he was gone.  It\u2019s a bad sign that she is so insecure she can\u2019t be separated from you and she\u2019s incredibly emotionally and financially immature.  Next she will want to start a family and tell you that you need to get a second job to make more.  Run now before she drags you down to her level.", "nta - instead of leaving your job leave her.  times are tough having a decent paying job one in a field that is hard to find somewhere else and if ur gf cant see that having money to support both of u down the road then she is not the person for u.", "NTA\n\nWhy is it your task to change jobs, and not hers?

Istg it'll come back later to bite your butt in the future", "ESH. I was with you until \" her she needs to suck it up or just travel with me out of town\". You can't just tell people to suck it up. It's fine to want different things and come to terms with not being compatible/breaking up, but you're just being assholes to each other.", "Nta but seem like you both j  two diffrent placenin your life I think you seriously need to consider if you want to be in this relationship.", "ESH\n\nYour girlfriend pitching a fit trying to get you to quit you job is immature  and short sited.\n\nShe is telling you that having a relationship where you are gone two weeks at a time is not what she wants and it makes her unhappy.  She wants a future with you and to her that means living in the same town full time. You\u2019re response to her was essentially  that you don\u2019t care how she feels.  This is what you want to do.  You are asking her to sacrifice for what you want.\n\nThis is a make or break relationship situation, time for you to decide which you want more.

If she\u2019s not on board anymore, and you\u2019re preference is to prioritize your job, perhaps it\u2019s time to cut ties with the GF who wants more from you than you\u2019re prepared to give her, so she can find a relationship with someone who will be a participant in her daily life rather than a visitor for a week every month.", "\u201ci\u201d before \u201ce\u201d, except after \u201cc\u201d, or when sounding like \u201ca\u201d as in \u201cneighbor\u201d or \u201cweigh\u201d.

I can see why she wouldn't want a relationship with an absent partner, or a partner who wants a job for good money that he just gives away. I can see why she'd think you might as well live near each other and make less money and be able to have a face-to-face relationship. She deserves to be happy, too. What do you need her for anyway, sex 1/3rd of the year? Lots of people would ask their boyfriend for more out of life than that. Just caulk it up to wanting different things out of life, I think.", "NTA you like your job and have no need to give it up.

You don't build a future *for* your partner you build it *with* them. You're telling her that she's along for the ride as you do exactly what *you* want to get exactly where *you* want to be... that's not a relationship.\n\nThis kind of lifestyle is very hard on relationships and both parties need to be on board. I don't think with your current attitude you can even work *towards* being on the same page as her because you literally just don't think she matters, so you should just let this relationship go. She can date a guy that isn't away all the time and you can date a girl that doesn't want you around all the time.", "Yeah I'm thinking the same thing, we seemed on the same page till recently I guess the 1 year anniversary was her point of deciding the current situation isn't what she wants.

The experience at your current job will likely make you a strong candidate for an apprenticeship in most unions. This may set you up for a knowable time living closer to paycheck to paycheck, but in the mid to long term your employment options will open up substantially.\n\nBut, leaving the job would place you in the position of being a dependent partner, and that\u2019s a very bad place to be.", "Bullshit.
