Ever since we've been together I've worked in a different state and come home on my week off. I love my job and make really good money that allows me to help support my family. I've always been very close with my family so it feels great to be able to pay back all support given to me during my years of struggling. I'm gone for 2 weeks at a time and home for a whole week off. I love my schedule and I think the work I do is really fun.\n\n After our 1 year anniversary my girlfriend has changed a little bit and has been asking more about our future and settling down. I told her I want to stay at my job, save money to buy a house eventually. She's been telling me that being away for 2 weeks at a time is really hard for her and that I should find something in town. I told her I'll look for something in the same feild but it's a lot harder to in our area to find. I've been searching the past 2 months and I haven't been able to find open positions for my kind of job anywhere within 200 miles. She's been getting really impatient and more and more confrontational everytime I go back to work. She's been telling me If I can't find something in my feild I should just find something else to do for a living. I'm not college educated and I only have years of experience in this one feild so if I switch I'm right back to barely being able to support myself.\n\n This last time I was going back to work we got into an argument about me leaving and she told me I need to figure it out soon because this is too hard for her. I finally snapped and told her she needs to suck it up or just travel with me out of town because I'm not quitting my job, stop helping support my family, and surviving paycheck to paycheck just to make her happy. I'm making sacrifices in my present to help build my future and our future if she still wants to be a part of it. She ended up calling me an asshole and that I care about money more than our relationship. So reddit AITA for telling my girlfriend that I'm not quitting my job just to make her happy?\n\nEdit: My family I am supporting is for returning favors to my older siblings and helping pay for my younger brothers treatment from his battle with leukemia,\nI have no degree or formal training in any other type of job so my pay decrease would be from 6 figures to minimum wage in a city with an astronomical cost of living\n\nUpdate: She actually called me after work and said she's been thinking hard about what was said before I left, she said she doesn't want to lose me but she wants to make this work so if I can't find a job in town before our lease is up she's willing to move to my apartment in the town i work and look for remote IT support work (right now she does physical IT work) so we can still travel back on my days off, I'm really skeptical about having her uproot everything just for me but let's just hope one of these intown companies gives me a call and we can all be happy", "created_utc": 1677948105, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11i55ob/aita_for_telling_my_23m_girlfriend_22f_im_not/", "score": 824, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Being what is as close to a single parent without actually being one is hard. Being responsible for every single thing alone for 2 weeks, then only getting 1 weeks respite is hard.

It\u2019s much harder to get injured and not have your partner there to take care of you, or have a family member die and not have your partner there to support you. Then one day you look at your future and realize that\u2019s going to be the reality of your life for the next 30 years. You\u2019ll never be able to count on your partner being there when you need them. \n\nThe one year point is pretty standard timing for the honeymoon period to end and the rose-coloured glasses to come off. She\u2019s likely decided to stop looking at the relationship as fun for now, and instead considering the implications of it in a forever sense. And she\u2019s realized it\u2019s not what she wants - and that\u2019s reasonable, it\u2019s not something many people would. There\u2019s a reason most of my older coworkers are either life-long bachelors or on wife #2 or #3. In some ways you\u2019re lucky it\u2019s happening now - I\u2019ve seen it take 4+ years for the resentment to build. Or take adding kids to the equation.\n\nSo yeah keep the job you love. But be honest with yourself. Realize that this job is going to make it hard for you to find a relationship and far harder to maintain one long term. What has just happened with this girlfriend could easily happen again and again, because there\u2019s no way for them to know it doesn\u2019t work until they try it.", "six fig vs . min wage I don't think that would impact the relationship positively either.", "NTA.\n\nI applaud you for tending to your needs and her needs. You dutifully searched for an alternative, and you have a need to support your family. I'm glad she is willing to try traveling with you.\n\nI understand why it may be hard on her, but you have so much to lose, including your (plural) futures. \n\nCongrats on your success.", "NTA\n\nI honestly really think you should break up with her having her uproot her life for you will not end well she will end up throwing it in your face and blaming you if things don\u2019t go well or if she decides that she\u2019s not happy one day. You need to do what\u2019s best for you and I don\u2019t think she fits in that anymore. Of course that\u2019s for you to decide, but be careful and actually really think about this before either of you make any decisions.", "NTA. My god, having a job you love is betting than winning the lottery. The GF is very young, so she may not understand that controlling someone is not love.", "Soft YTA because of the way you talked to her. She'd been expressing that she wasn't happy for a while, and you kept ignoring it. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore and blew up at you, and you returned the same energy rather than staying calm. \n\nAll she wants is to spend more time with. In a sense you got mad at her and lashed out for wanting to be with you", "I think you just don\u2019t want to be with her, and I think your last remark just makes my point YTA. She just wants to be near her boyfriend I think her asking you to move within a reasonable or to quit your job. I\u2019m sorry was unreasonable but then she came up with a compromise and you don\u2019t even really want her there so I think you live in a way that\u2019s comfortable for you when you have a part-time girlfriend I think it should break up with her and just let her go about her life.", "This. OP even if you give up your job, I sincerely doubt she\u2019s done trying to change you to suit HER needs. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "TIL a month is three weeks.", "Hey... I want to tell you I think you're doing amazing. Although the details are different, I went from minimum wage to high pay in a short time without a degree, and it was life changing for my family. Money doesn't always mean materialism, more money can be quality of life. Safe housing, good food. education, healthcare. Keep looking out for you and yours. Your job sounds difficult but it's what's making the system work for you. You're a good man.", "He has a job he loves. Millions of people would give an arm to have a job they even like. He absolutely should not quit. He invited her to travel with him. She\u2019s being controlling. That never ends well."]}
