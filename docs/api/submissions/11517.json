He is very active on social media, mostly favoring instagram, and will often post short videos of him walking with them over at the lake or by the river. \n\nToday, he came home from a walk with our dog and showed me a time lapse he did during his walk. It starts with him in the parking lot of the state park before crossing the street and following the trail that ends at our front door. I told him it was super cool and a neat perspective. I then heard him fiddling around with music on his phone, like the same short tune playing repeatedly, so I had an idea of what he was doing. I glanced at his phone and saw him posting it on his instagram. I immediately asked him not to since it literally shows the walk to our front door, we have a small child who lives here and I don\u2019t feel comfortable with people we don\u2019t know knowing where we live.

No just no. You and your husband need to set ground rules about what is and isn\u2019t ok to post on the internet. If your accounts aren\u2019t locked down to friends (irl) and family only...posting where you live and telling the random internet world what city you live in is...DANGEROUS!!!!", "NTA\n\nNot at all. I wish people used more common sense when it comes to what they reveal online. I don't know whether your husband is like this. But a lot of guys view safety issues through a different lens than women. They're not used to thinking of themselves as in danger, and will often do things, or not do things that leave them vulnerable in ways we as women would never dream of doing. \n\nSo if he seems  a bit confused, or is taking a bit of an attitude about your caution, it's not because you're being unreasonable. It might be because he's just not used to thinking in those terms.", "NTA though I'd have a talk with your husband and really explain why that would be unsafe. It likely never occurred to him that that could cause problems. Like it never occurs to most men that walking to your car in an unlit garage could be dangerous or to get into their car through their passenger door because there's a van parked on the driver's side. Most don't even notice if someone starts walking behind them at night. They don't have to think about or be aware of those things like women do. We're taught from a young age what to look out for, boys aren't.", "NTA perfectly reasonable request. Could you compromise and have him crop the last bit so it ends in the park?", "NTA. You have boundaries for your privacy. That\u2019s perfectly acceptable.", "NTA. That sorta thing presents a massive vulnerability that an asshole a chip on their shoulder can use against you. And essentially what others are saying\u2026letting strangers online know where you live is unsettling.\n\nEdit: Sounds like you were also respectful but assertive about it which is good. Hopefully he\u2019ll warm up more to where you\u2019re coming from.", "NTA. Its good to make sure you aren't putting too much on social media", "NTA. Very valid concern.", "NTA. You are not overreacting. This is a reasonable boundary to set.\n\nIs anything bad likely to happen because a stranger could technically figure out where you live? No. But could something bad happen if you are unlucky enough to become the target of someone with bad intent? Yes. Do you slightly increase the likelihood of becoming the target of someone with bad intent when you post public videos online. Also yes. \n\nI think that you have set a perfectly reasonable boundary. Many people wouldn't be comfortable publicly sharing videos of themselves and their kids online at all. Not including images that enable strangers to find out your home address is a good compromise. It minimises any risk to you, your home and your family, but still enables him to share details of his daily life, which he obviously takes enjoyment from", "NTA. Your request and reaction was completely reasonable", "Absolutely NTA. What was he thinking", "NTA. A teacher friend of mine was doxed just by mentioning a nearby landmark. Internet peeps be crazy.", "NTA. Not just your child. It also affects your safety. If he's active on insta while on vacation it also let's thieves know where he lives and when it's empty. Not safe.", "NTA\n\nYou are well within your rights to have boundaries with regard to what he posts about your home where you also live and your child also lives. Looking out for your well-being and the well-being of your kid is not overreacting.\n\nYou said that he's already posted the general nature area and mentioned the town before, which you seem (perhaps reluctantly) okay with. I'm wondering if there can be a compromise with this video in which he can edit out the part(s) that show the neighborhood/your house.\n\nI also think having a serious conversation (i.e. not 'in-the-moment' where he's getting defensive) with your husband about your boundaries might be a good idea so that he understands why it's not ok for you that he posts your home/neighborhood in addition to the nature area where he walks.", "NTA. Jeez, no! That's media literacy 101 for 10-year olds not to give away where you live on the internet, not to tell your address, not to post pictures that allow people to easily identify or find your house, and preferably not places where a potential stalker could hang out and wait for you to show up. Showing the actual path to your house breaks all of those rules.\n\nAnd him not respecting your concerns is pretty shitty", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
