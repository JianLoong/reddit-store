To make a long story short, my (23F) brother (28M) and my coworker/ex girlfriend (26F) met at a celebratory dinner that my company held for me when I got my promotion. Let\u2019s call her Chels. They hit it off and started dating, this was about 8 months ago. \n\nI was very very upset about their relationship at first, only because I hate mixing work and personal affairs. She would constantly try to talk to me only to talk about my brother, his interests, what his plans were, etc. I learned to deal with it and would always tell her I don\u2019t want to talk about my brother while at work. Thankfully she respected that and would rarely bring him up. \n\nFast forward to now, they went through a very messy breakup. I don\u2019t live with my brother, so obviously I don\u2019t know the details nor his reasoning behind the breakup. Chels and I work in the same department and she\u2019s been slacking. She\u2019s not doing what she\u2019s supposed to do, coming late, making mistakes on projects that I\u2019m also on, so this affects my performance too.  \n\nI held back for a week because I understand she\u2019s sad and it\u2019s a hard time for her. However, she\u2019s been constantly been snarky to me as well, intentionally not telling me about certain details when it comes to our projects and just overall not being a team player. She\u2019s been talking behind my back as well about a situation that has nothing to do with me.\n\nI came up to her and told her she needs to stop being childish and deal with her breakup like an adult, especially at work. I told her she needs to stop bringing me into her business, as I didn\u2019t have anything to do with her relationship with my brother. \n\nI guess she went and told my coworkers a different story, as they have been messaging me and telling me that I am inconsiderate and have no empathy for Chels. \n\nAITA for feeling this way?", "created_utc": 1697565988, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a4kne/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_ex_to_separate_work/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Talk to your manager about what's going on and get them to help you, that's what they're supposed to do. She's almost certainly lashing out at you because she can't lash put at your brother, which clearly isn't your fault but to her brain at the moment it is.
