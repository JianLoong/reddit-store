CPS is a bunch of overworked social workers who get a billion calls - dumb calls like this one would be, cutting into the resources for children who actually need them.

CPS is too far.", "but in another comment you just told me the mother watched this. lol. so in response to the other thread: the first mention of the mother in your post is after you yelled \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d to teenage boys. had you seen the mother watching this 1. you would\u2019ve mentioned this in the post, i\u2019m certain, and 2. why wouldn\u2019t you have said something to her instead of her children?? because then you would\u2019ve let that go on knowing the mother saw it? why would you choose to speak to the MINORS and not the ADULT. (NOW RESPONDING GO THIS THREAD) but clearly  you had no idea who the mother was until she yelled at you. like you just said in this thread. \n\neither way. i\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong in the situation. could you have handled it better? yes. i mean you didn\u2019t need to  curse at children, but it is what it is and i understand it. i would\u2019ve been upset and cursing as well. but i would\u2019ve directed that at the mother. \n\nalso, CPS wouldn\u2019t come right away. they never do. and im pretty sure a hotel can\u2019t give you other guests names.  AND again the woman if she knows her rights would be stupid to even speak to CPS. CPS doesn\u2019t deal with what if\u2019s and could have\u2019s. could she have drowned? yes. good thing you were there - seriously. but again\u2026 this is not a matter for CPS, imo. have a nice night.", "bless your heart. don\u2019t come on the internet if you don\u2019t wanna see other people\u2019s opinions. \ud83d\ude02 especially in this kind of sub. i only read 2? cps comments. and no. i will never stop talking about how shitty people are for needlessly involving CPS. ever.", "yeah. you\u2019re right. what\u2019s wrong with me is i\u2019ve seen children ripped from their parents arms over bullshit from CPS. it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking.

Poor little girl, thank you for looking out for her.", "NTA\n\nThey were terrorizing her, and risking her life.\nI think you should have called CPS.", "NTA. If you didn't call the police and/or CPS, you should.", "Yeah, this was an actually dangerous situation. You did the right thing", "You are absolutely NTA for what you did.  They were terrorizing that little girl, and they're very lucky you didn't call the police or, at the very least, gone and gotten the hotel staff, as I'm sure they wouldn't be ok with it, either.", "NTA well done", "YTA. You shouldn't have let it get so far. Most public pools have rules about roughhousing and age requirements for using the pool. When it started was the time to approach the hotel staff... I was going to say please don't touch children you don't know, but I changed my mind, I remembered something. When my daughter was around 5yrs old we took a 4hr train trip to see family. When we arrived at our destination, I had to carry our luggage as my daughter held my pocket and walked beside me. We had to go up a flight in the escalator. She lost her balance and fell backwards. Before I could even drop my bags the gentleman a few steps behind us caught her and held her hand to the top. I couldn't thank him enough.", "Yeah what\u2019s wrong with your sister.", "Quite frankly, and this might get me downvoted, but I don\u2019t see anything wrong with OP\u2019s actions, yelling at the kids included. They had already been told to knock it off by an adult for an action that was dangerous, and they continued doing it to the point where if OP hadn\u2019t been there, what would\u2019ve happened? People get mad when others yell at their kids, but they don\u2019t look at the reason behind it. I would never yell at a child that I didn\u2019t know unless they were doing something really reckless.", "NTA. Yeah if you yelled at like a small kid not the best action, but these were teenagers victimizing and endangering a smaller child.", "Forget CPS. Those kids could have had the cops called on them. What they were doing was attempted murder.", "If their parents failed them so badly to that point, being yelled at and shamed in public for their behavior can only be beneficial at this point. Since their parents obviously aren't instilling a sense of right and wrong, seeing such a strong reaction from a stranger will hopefully stay with them", "I always wonder why people like that have kids.", "Edit: I was made aware, I misunderstood the original comment. I'll still leave my answer here. \n\nThis is no case to say \"boys will be boys\". Saying that is 1. For situations like playing in dirt or having a light saber fight and 2. still sexist in most scenarios. Here it diminishes their dangerous and sadistic actions.\n\nPlease think about how you use that phrase. Don't use it to normalise abuse or assault.", "how is this y t a then? it sounds like you meant nta", "Plus, they were teens. They knew damn well what they were doing.", "Honestly both could be called. The woman is fine with her kids drowning her other child.", "Kids who do shit like this are almost always victims themselves; they're doing what they're taught is acceptable. (As demonstrated by the lack of parental concern.) CPS is definitely still the best call.", "I'm surprised enough people saw this pale a$$ emoji to get it downvoted 250+ times.\n\nEdit: Making it clear that OP is NTA and I disagree w/the original 'thumbs down' emoji.", "I read their comment as having the same mentality you're speaking of- that they are calling out the bs of the 'boys will be boys' saying.", "I do believe the comment you're replying to was saying it facetiously. \"Torture and terror and boys will be boys\" as a sweeping statement of bad things.", "I beg your pardon?  I equated it to terror and torture.", "Victim of abuse and neglect here to tell you that this is clearly abuse and neglect. She wasn\u2019t paying attention at all to her six year old child while she was in the pool. There is absolutely no way she couldn\u2019t have heard her crying and screaming. The fact that those teen boys even thought to do something so cruel to their six year old sister is genuinely troubling and disturbing, especially after being told to stop multiple times by their sister and an adult. It\u2019s likely that whatever\u2019s going on at home plays a part in why they\u2019re like that. This is event was a MASSIVE red flag. As stated by OP, sibling abuse is a thing. This isn\u2019t just two teen boys being jerks.\n\n**That little girl could\u2019ve died.** If I was OP, I would\u2019ve said way worse to the mother. I have no tolerance for cruelty towards children.", "Wow you sound like a sick person. I hope you get some help and learn some empathy. Helpless kids need to be protected. In this case the authorities should have been called and that negligent mother taught a lesson.  You need a moral compass.", "Please stop flaunting that wisdom has chased you but you're a faster runner.", "No, if anyone deserved to be cussed it\u2019s those two little creeps.", "Hey OP, thank you. When I was little this was my sister and cousins favorite \"game\" to play and everyone thought it was so funny because I was tiny and spunky, right up until I needed CPR and have never liked swimming since. If someone had of stepped in to help me I would have been forever grateful, even at that age. Not only did you rescue that kid but your anger showed her it wasn't just a normal thing she has to put up with, and that some adults will listen to cries for help. So in fact even your anger was helpful. Those kids, that mom, and your sister can kick rocks.", "Clear NTA.\n\nI'd have asked the mum if she wanted me to do it to her.", "Because I feel OP shouldn't have let it go on so long.", "Hard to miss 8 billion paragraphs- she\u2019s all over the place- starts out claiming she supports CPS because they are overwhelmed and then pivots to \u201cCPS sucks because they took a kids from my abusive friends\u201d.", "they so obsessed wiff me.", "Since English is my second language and I'm still learning it's possible I didn't understand the real intention, so I felt like pointing it out", "Agree!", "As I answered to another answer: it seems I misunderstood your comment since English is not my first language. I felt like pointing out what I did, even though it seems to be obvious you didn't mean it the way I understood it. Sorry for that. I'll still leave my comment up.", "whatever you say, my dude.", "goooooood one.", "Your probably a trolls. If you aren't Its legitimately \nconcerning your can't recognize what abuse and neglect is...", "Oh shoot, I didn't see her other comments.", "There's definitely a learned inflection when reading, especially comments on the internet outside your native language! \n\nI fully agree with your statement re: using the phrase.", "Who TF cares!! I\u2019m sure they could\u2019ve gotten the info from the hotel! NTA OP", "CPS barely has the resources to handle addiction or physical abuse cases.", "if only you knew.", "It\u2019s really not worth the read and will take 14 hours because her delusion stems so far that she believes she is wise- basically says the 6 year old wasn\u2019t in any danger and NEVER EVER call CPS. That seems to be her driving force and one would have to conclude that she has been in trouble with CPS for her stanch aggression towards the agency.", "Because when the kid does get seriously injured or killed, oh well. Because you know cps was too much. \ud83d\ude44", "So should CPS be involved after the little girl drowns? If the mom is letting the teenagers treat her like this in a public setting, it could very well be worse at home.", "Reddit glitches like that sometimes. If they'd have deleted their comments there'd be a \\[deleted\\] notification still visible. But the comments are visible in the user's \"comments\" section.\n\nYou're coming across kinda aggressive, paranoid and unhinged tbh gotta say. Stalking a user across posts to comment on them in unrelated discussions is very, uhhh, intense and not normal reddit behaviour.\n\nYou're *really* not being the best possible advocate for your cause or arguments right now, just saying", "As a former foster kid, shut up. CPS sucks, but most of the time even when there IS ABUSE they don't do shit because they want to keep families together. You, or whomever you knew who lost kids had to have done some horrible shit to lose their kids. The whole \"THE GOVERNMENT IS KIDNAPPING BABIES\" conspiracy is getting old. I've only ever heard it from anti-vaxxers or religious whackadoodles who lost their kids because of their own doing.", "Let me guess, CPS is involved in your life, and its everyone else's fault. \n\nYou are right.
