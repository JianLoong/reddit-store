The hotel had an indoor pool. \n\nI had my 2 boys at the pool (ages 10 and 12). I was in the pool with them and my sister. \n\nIt was a bit crowded.  \n\nAt one point I noticed 2 boys, early teens, and a young girl, maybe 6 in the pool. She seemed to be a pretty good lil swimmer. \n\nA while later I noticed she was in the deeper side where she was unable to reach the bottom, and was trying to get to the side of the pool.\n\nEvery time she did this the boys would toss her back into the center and laugh. I noticed she was getting upset, and a bit frantic but they jeot doing it. \n\nI told them to knock it off, and she got to the side and was obviously out of breath. \n\nAbout 20 minutes later ot started again. This time they did not listen when i told them to cut it out and the little girl was obviously struggling, yelling at them to stop and crying. \n\nI swam over, grabbed her and helped her get out of the pool. I looked at the boys and yelled \"what the f* is wrong with you?!?!\" \n\nAt this point a woman came over and started screaming about how dare I yell at and curse at her children, and that I'm lucky she doesn't have me arrested for touching her daughter.\"\n\n\nI told her she was raising some sadistic boys, and she could go ahead and call the cops, because I'm sure CPS would be interested to know she was watching this happen. \n\nMy sister said I took it too far, but that poor little girl was SO upset, and she literally could have drowned. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1669855313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z98wkk/aita_for_grabing_a_child_and_cussing_and/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

CPS is a bunch of overworked social workers who get a billion calls - dumb calls like this one would be, cutting into the resources for children who actually need them. CPS is broken. and when organizations that deal with kids are broken, they break innocent children. sorry i\u2019m not willing to call CPS on every mom who is likely exhausted while she\u2019s probably on vacation with 3 kids, especially 2 teenagers, and was maybe on her phone for a few minutes, finally having a little while to herself and dumbly trusted her children to behave. that doesn\u2019t deserve a call to CPS. \n\nbut yeah what\u2019s wrong with me. lol.\n\ni don\u2019t work for CPS. i work with family\u2019s who have been fucked by CPS cause of people like y\u2019all", "The little girl seemed to be pretty traumatized by her sibling behavior.

The mom threatened cops and OP clapped back", "She was a guest at the hotel, so yes, she likely could have been found pretty easily. \n\nAnd again, are you familiar with dry drowning? The girl was screaming and crying, as well as being tossed back to the center of the pool.

Brain injuries from drowning.", "No one cares about your opinion, stop posting to every CPS comment JFC", "No seriously- there is something wrong with you.", "Honestly I get where you're coming from and I understand your anger in this situation, having seen the issues with CPS with your own eyes. It's terrifying that the girl could have died bc of her mother's neglect, and it's equally terrifying thinking of what could have happened to her in the unlikely case CPS did show up and took her from her family. \n\nJust remember that the hive mind on Reddit will have everyone downvoting you and saying you shouldn't have kids even when you're making good points.

CPS would do nothing about this except tell the mother \u201cwatch your kids a little better\u201d and that\u2019s IF they even did anything with the report -  it\u2019s VERRRRRY unlikely they\u2019d do anything about a \u201ci was at the pool and these two brothers were messing with their sister and she could\u2019ve drown and i\u2019m not sure if the mother saw this or not. i saw them when i was staying at the such and such hotel, but i don\u2019t know her name or address\u201d report. this is not CPS worthy at all. not every seemingly dysfunctional family with a mom who doesn\u2019t have her eyes on her kids every second of every minute needs CPS called on them.\n\nOP did mostly the right thing. the other parent is in the wrong as are her children. and i respect OP for being that little girls voice. but.. CPS is too far.", "but in another comment you just told me the mother watched this. lol. so in response to the other thread: the first mention of the mother in your post is after you yelled \u201cwhat the fuck is wrong with you?\u201d to teenage boys. had you seen the mother watching this 1. you would\u2019ve mentioned this in the post, i\u2019m certain, and 2. why wouldn\u2019t you have said something to her instead of her children?? because then you would\u2019ve let that go on knowing the mother saw it? why would you choose to speak to the MINORS and not the ADULT. (NOW RESPONDING GO THIS THREAD) but clearly  you had no idea who the mother was until she yelled at you. like you just said in this thread. \n\neither way. i\u2019m not saying you\u2019re wrong in the situation. could you have handled it better? yes. i mean you didn\u2019t need to  curse at children, but it is what it is and i understand it. i would\u2019ve been upset and cursing as well. but i would\u2019ve directed that at the mother. \n\nalso, CPS wouldn\u2019t come right away. they never do. and im pretty sure a hotel can\u2019t give you other guests names.  AND again the woman if she knows her rights would be stupid to even speak to CPS. CPS doesn\u2019t deal with what if\u2019s and could have\u2019s. could she have drowned? yes. good thing you were there - seriously. but again\u2026 this is not a matter for CPS, imo. have a nice night.", "bless your heart. don\u2019t come on the internet if you don\u2019t wanna see other people\u2019s opinions. \ud83d\ude02 especially in this kind of sub. i only read 2? cps comments. and no. i will never stop talking about how shitty people are for needlessly involving CPS. ever.", "yeah. you\u2019re right. what\u2019s wrong with me is i\u2019ve seen children ripped from their parents arms over bullshit from CPS. it\u2019s absolutely heartbreaking. CPS is not what you think it is.", "oh, baby, don\u2019t worry about me. \ud83d\ude0a  downvoting doesn\u2019t bother me. i\u2019m not trying to win anything. just another faceless nobody sharing their opinion on the internet. these people do not bother me (notice i\u2019m not the one upset by anyone\u2019s comments, i\u2019m not lashing out, calling anyone names, dogging them - because i\u2019m an adult and can share my opinion like one). they too are faceless behind their phones and it gives them bigger balls than they actually have. thank you for being an adult though, haha. i hope you have a fabulous day/night/rest of your week.", "I understand how cps works.  I've  had plenty of run ins with them as a kid", "Fair points.", "Do not have kids.", "Yes because you\u2019re some great mOm huh?
