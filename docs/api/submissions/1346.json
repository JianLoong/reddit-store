It's a small business that focuses on making all attempts for it to be less scary when doing exams which is especially good for high anxiety pets.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne of my staff, let's call her Ann, has two children. I'm childfree but I'm going to go ahead and judge her parenting style for frankly being what I see as a lot of unnecessary, constant, ineffective yelling. I probably should have said no kids but there is another staff, let's call her Beth, that has a child who comes in sometimes but he has always just stayed quietly in the reception area with a tablet, toy or book and it felt unnecessary to ban children when Beth's child has always been fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo unto the cage, part of the low stress environment is that for some routine exams with dogs it is less stressful to let them be outside. It's a small fenced in area but I've lived in cities and definitely seen smaller yards on houses. However, it has a large 8ft chain-link fence. It's not even used very often as most procedures just need to be inside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo one day we have a pet inside while Ann's kids are in the waiting room. They start getting very noisy and I can hear Ann start yelling at them. This already strikes me as unprofessional but especially so for the clinic that we advertise as being low stress. After the exam I explain that going forward when we have clients in, the children must go wait outside for the duration.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnn states that is locking her kids in a cage and some of the other staff that are close to Ann chimed in about how that is cruel. Before it was always \"The yard\" but I guess it's suddenly a cage now. Ann argued about how her kids would stay in the waiting room of her old job but I know she understands we operate differently than a large vet's office. And of course she complains about how Beth has had her kid in more times and never had to go sit in a cage.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGranted, the fence is so high and it's a smaller enclosed area but it's just a small fenced in yard and I can't let the kids stay inside so I explain that the only option I see is the so-called \"cage\". We had one more client for the day so I told her it would only be about 30-45 minutes and then they could come back in while we closed-up. The weather was nice and we hadn't even had any dogs in there that day so it's not like it's poop-filled or anything (we keep the grass short and do a quick poop check at the end of the day if there were outside exams). Ann begrudgingly told the kids to go play outside for a while and everything was fine but I can tell she is still annoyed. I also plan on allowing Beth's kid to stay inside since it feel unfair to punish them because of Ann but I am sure that is going to make her resentful too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, AITA for making her leave her kids outside in the \"cage\"?", "created_utc": 1667588693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym7dic/aita_for_making_an_employee_leave_her_kids_in_a/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd be upset if I brought my pet in and had to deal with someone yelling at their badly behaved kids. It's not the right environment for rambunctious kids.", "NTA. Hell go further and tell her that her kids are not welcome at her JOB anymore. Jfc some people are so damn entitled.", "NTA\n\nIt isn\u2019t a cage, it is an small fenced in area.\n\nThat said, you need a 2 strikes rules.  Not three, 2.  Two strikes and the children can\u2019t be in the office.  Period.\n\nThey had their first strike, and they were loud in the waiting room.  Ann had her first strike, as well.  It is VERY unprofessional for her to yell at her kids in your clinic.  So, time to counsel her on her behavior  as well as that of her children.  They get one more chance.  If they are loud in the waiting room, and Ann starts behaving unprofessionally in the office again, then the kids cannot be there.\n\nThis way, you can continue to allow Beth\u2019s quiet child, as well as future quiet children for short periods.  \n\nThere are big differences between quiet children waiting until mom is off work, and rowdy children.  You can allow quiet children, but not rowdy ones.", "YTA not for this specifically, but because you're not managing Ann effectively and it's affecting your business. You need to sit her down at a time when her kids aren't around, lay out that you are a business that needs calm and quiet to serve your clients, and when her kids are around that's not possible. Don't let her bring Beth's kid into it; this is an Ann problem, and the \"cage\" solution is a band-aid on a gaping wound. Highly recommend reading Ask a Manager to get some sample scripts.", "Tell her she can't bring her kids to work as the are disruptive.", "NTA why are these people bringing their kids to work anyway?", "yeah, this sounds like a better solution than a no children policy.\n\nit allows OP to make it clear that this isn't about kids but about behavior. and honestly, OP (or the clinic's manager if there is one) should be speaking with Ann and letting her know that her behavior such as X, Y, and Z isn't okay."]}
