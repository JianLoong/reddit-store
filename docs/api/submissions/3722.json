I visited her early this month at her request to check out a faulty outlet. In the process of diagnosing and repairing her issue, I found stuff of greater concern.  This was her new backup generator system that was not up to code in the least. Of the many issues with the workmanship, there were two unforgivable ones. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe first was no interlock/transfer panel on the main breaker unit. Having one is legally required for these systems as it prevents backflow. The second one was the widowmaker connection on the generator. Widowmaker cables are both not up to code and are illegal due to the electrocution hazard. This led to me documenting everything before speaking to my grandma. She was understandably upset and wanted everything to be brought up to code. This led to her asking if I could handle everything for her which I agreed to do. The first thing I did was try to get the original contractor to fix their work. The contractor turned out to be her Neighbour's son Mark. I called Mark and asked him to come by as there were problems with the system. When he did I painstakingly pointed out every violation that had been made with the system.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfterwards, I gave two options, either refund the work and be reported or repair it to code. At first, he refused and denied any code violations until I pulled my license out. He then quickly changed the tune and agreed to repair the work. Before letting him even start I asked for his legally required license. The moment I asked this he tried to lie about how he doesn't need one. I  had none of it and sent him home saying that we expect a refund and he will be reported for unlicensed work. I stayed true and reported him which led to inspections from the electrical company and others. Things came to a head this week when he was not only fined but arrested as well. This was confirmed by his mother who called my grandma asking to speak with me. When I did she was not happy and said some spicy things before I hung up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1669941623, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za5oyf/aita_for_getting_a_neighbors_son_arrested_over/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could've gotten someone killed.", "Definitely NTA here, this is a lot more serious than just changing out a fixture or other handyman type work.\n\nWhy did grandma throw the work his way instead of having you do it in the first place? Did his mother give her a sob story about Mark desperately needing work and money?", "NTA My great uncle had a \"helpful\" neighbor who ripped him off blind. As his health deteriorated, one his nephews, a well respected attorney, took over his finances and after a couple of \"discussions\" with the neighbor regarding his qualifications,  clawed back some money and cut the leech off. It's sad but people do take advantage of elderly people.", "NTA. You prevented him from continuing to do unsafe work. You may very well have saved the lives of future customers of his.", "NTA  He could have killed your grandmother! How many other people are out there who have gotten work done by this guy not knowing that he is unlicensed and are in danger? This is really a good thing that you have done.", "NTA. It\u2019s dangerous and fraudulent. You\u2019ll have to get your grandma to sue him in small claims court if he doesn\u2019t pay. Depending on how many people he\u2019s done that to the police might not charge him with anything more than a misdemeanor for fraud and he\u2019ll have to pay a fine. If they arrested him then he probably had warrants out because the police would rather let it be settled in small claims since it involved money.", "NTA.

I wouldn't talk to the police without an attorney if they come asking you about it. With that said, your grandmother may be mistaken. I highly doubt somebody would be arrested over this.

Yes he did shoddy work but if he gave a refund, then having him arrested was excessive and imo pretty shitty of you.", "I do not believe this is true.  Where exactly is it that doing work improperly is a criminal offence?", "More info is needed, but it's possibly like this.\n\nMark is the neighbor's son. Grandma has possibly lived in the house for many years and known the neighbor for a good amount of time. If the neighbor is her friend or trustworthy acquaintance, then Grandma has a reason to trust that Mark will do a good job. \n\nThe neighbor might not have known Mark was negligent until Mark was arrested. It might be a stretch, but, a regular person wouldn't know as much as a professional electrician. Mark could've just told his parent he was an electrician, talked about his work as one, and paid the bills with that money. The parent wouldn't know if there was a problem because Mark was an electrician.\n\nThe biggest issue imo is the neighbor's house. If the work on Grandma's house is deadly, then the neighbors house could be 10x that.

The neighbor did the work without having a license - he wasn't qualified to do the work. The penalty is a hefty fine and possibly jail time. If he had a license he would have had to prove he knew what he was doing, they don't just pass them out if you're able to pay for one.
