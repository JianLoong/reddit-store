She was understandably upset and wanted everything to be brought up to code. This led to her asking if I could handle everything for her which I agreed to do. The first thing I did was try to get the original contractor to fix their work. The contractor turned out to be her Neighbour's son Mark.

I'm no electrician but it sounds like your grandmother could have been seriously hurt due to Mark's negligence.", "NTA that sheister could have gotten someone killed!", "NTA but out of sheer curiosity, did he claim to be a licensed electrician to your grandmother and charge her full price?", "NTA, I'm a GC and would have lost my shit lol", "Wonder how spicy the calls would have been if Grandma had been fried in her bed?

They're only made in a diy fashion, but they're laughably easy to make. Just a normal 3 wire cable, with male on both ends. All parts can be bought at any home improvement store. One goes into your generator, lol the breaker on a circuit, the other goes into an outlet on that circuit, and you can power anything on that circuit.\n\nThe problem lies when it's hooked up to your whole grid, that's still on the main public grid. You're supposed to have a lock out so that only one can be used at a given time. Back feeding when the grid is down is HIGHLY dangerous and illegal"]}
