My oldest daughter Gracie is from my first marriage. She's just turned 17. I have Milo 10 and Lyric 7 with my current husband. My ex-husband and I separated days after Gracie's first birthday because he told me he wanted to see other women and wanted me to wait for him. I did not and I filed for divorce. He always remained part of Gracie's life but he made it clear he only wanted me when it suited him. After the divorce I met my current husband. Gracie was 4 before she was introduced to him. Her dad was angry when I found someone else. He hated my husband and Gracie always knew it. I went through the courts when my ex would not stop badmouthing my husband to Gracie and did not leave her out of the adult issues we were having. The courts were not helpful at all and sent us to co-parenting classes. Gracie was hesitant with my husband. She adored her dad and didn't want him to feel hurt. This is something she told a therapist when she was young. Then when she was 8 her dad died and it feels like ever since then there was no way my husband could be anything to her. We never expected him to be her dad. But to be someone she trusts and cares about.\n\nGracie holds him at arms length and doesn't treat him like a member of her family. She doesn't include him like she does extended family. An example was last March. She was spotlighted in her art club. She sent a group chat message to me, both sets of grandparents and her uncles and aunts but did not include my husband. I mentioned it to my husband when I got home and she'd made it home before me and still hadn't told him. I brought it up to her and she said he wasn't on the need to know list for her.\n\nIt hurts my husband and I have tried to facilitate their relationship to be more but I don't think it was enough. A couple of days ago Gracie was saying she needed help with some engineering questions and she wanted to go over to my BIL's (sister's husband) brother's house to ask him some questions. I asked her why she had to go to all that trouble when my husband could have answered the questions for her. She said it made more sense to her to ask her uncle's brother. This is when I told her I don't like how she does that, how she treats my husband like he's not there, like he's not part of the family. I told her we never ever asked her to replace her dad or to consider them the same but she excludes him and keeps him out and he has only ever been kind to her. I told her it's something I would like her to work on. She got mad and told me I chose to marry him, she didn't choose to have him in her life. She also said it wasn't my business what their relationship is like. I told her I'm her mom and I love her, and I'm his wife and I love him and I just want them to get along. She's still angry at me and I'm trying to figure out if I did the wrong thing here.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673967852, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10eefan/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_dont_like_how_she/", "score": 1415, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's very natural for you to want her to have a good relationship with your husband. It's also pretty natural for her, given her life story as you present it, to not feel that close to him. And while it would certainly be very nice if she did put in more effort with him, I don't think it should be required of her.", "Tricky.\n\nYour daughter is a victim of your ex\u2019s manipulation, and may benefit from therapy to unpick this, if she\u2019s not already receiving some. \n\nYou\u2019re not an AH for asking Gracie to be more polite and inclusive towards your husband - you\u2019re a family and her actions are rude and hurtful. \n\nYou tip over slightly into AH territory by demanding that she have a *relationship* with him. She doesn\u2019t have to care or love him - particularly when that\u2019s at the moment definitely bound up in her latent grief and loyalty towards her father. \n\nBut she\u2019s 17 and old enough to know when she\u2019s being deliberately exclusionary and hurtful, and that\u2019s a bullying tactic. She\u2019s old enough to know and do better. \n\nI think continue to ask her to work on being kind and polite, but don\u2019t ask her to consider your husband *her* family. She needs to understand that he\u2019s a part of *the* family, though, and the father of her half siblings, son in law to grandma etc. and he can\u2019t be cut out of family text chains etc. on her whims. \n\nI\u2019m not comfortable making a definitive judgement here. Best of luck!", "NTA for what you said to her. Sadly, your ex may have completely poisoned Gracie's mind when she was very young, to where she's turned into this hateful teen towards your husband. I don't know if there's ever going to be recovery from this. And shame on the courts as well. I'm sorry you're having to be stuck in the middle on this. I'd say your now deceased ex is the true AH.", "INFO: Does Gracie know the full story of why her dad left? It may be helpful to explain that to her as she has clearly been manipulated by her father against your husband from an early age and therapy for her and family therapy may offer some benefit to help unpack how her dad only wanted you when it was conscientious for him.", "This is a tough one, but NAH (no assholes here). Your daughter is being cold and distant, which is different than outright rude. I'm sure her behavior hurts your husband, and I know it hurts you. But she gets to decide who she allows into her world. (I hope she doesn't grow to regret freezing your husband out\u2014you can never have too many friends in this world.) \n\nFor your part, though, your daughter still needs parenting. (Yes, for the Reddit crowd who believes that 18 is a magical number and that you're almost fully formed at 17.) Based on your description of events, it seems that all you were doing was parenting your child. You have my sympathy because your family situation has not worked according to plan. And I hope that things change for the positive for everyone as time moves forward.", "NAH for now, but if you keep pushing it becomes y t a. She\u2019s not rude to him, she doesn\u2019t disrespect him. She just doesn\u2019t like him. That\u2019s okay. She doesn\u2019t have to want to go to him for advice or share her personal accomplishments with him. It\u2019s okay for you to tell her it\u2019s important to you that she tries with him, but she isn\u2019t wrong if she chooses not to.", "NAH, it isn\u2019t great but you said yourself that things can\u2019t be forced. My parents got divorced when I was a teen and it ruined my relationship with both of them. I don\u2019t see a point in having relationships with their partner(s) since I had parents. Sometimes it\u2019s just easier on the kid to maintain distance.", "NAH...You expressed how you felt, and she told you where she stands on the issue. She's on the cusp of adulthood, so you're going to have to accept whatever she decides. She may mature and realize her animosity is misplaced.", "NTA for telling her how you feel\nYTA for pressuring her\n\nShe\u2019s right, she never made the decision to have him in her life, and it\u2019s her decision what kind of relationship she wants to have with him. You can be hurt, but ultimately you can\u2019t do anything about it. As long as she is polite to him and doesn\u2019t scream, belittle, or outright ignore him when he\u2019s talking to her she\u2019s well within her rights.\n\nThat being said, maybe you could sit down with her and talk about the whole situation calmly, that her dad was not perfect to you and that he tried to manipulate her into disliking your husband, who has done nothing wrong", "Nta to me unfortunately she had her dad constantly saying things about him to her and she probably is caring his grudge on for him since he passed. I mean as long as she is at the least respectful to him liking him or including him is probably out of the question sadly. Expecting her to show kindness to someone who cares and has cared for her shouldn't be an to much to ask but she sadly will never treat him like family", "Yes, light YWBTA\n\nThe drama from your first marriage and the manipulation by her father are what caused your daughter to be pulled into the middle.\n\nShe's 17 and capable of deciding her own relationships and feelings now. You CANNOT force her to accept or be close to your husband, and will just further alienate by pushing.\n\nShe's allowed to decide to ask WHOMEVER she wanted about her questions. You decided to take it as a personal affront to your husband, which is making it into drama.\n\nShe's right, she didn't choose who you married. Keep trying to force her and she will likely go NC later on.", "INFO: Has your husband tried to be part of her life or does he treat her differently than his own children?", "NTA. This is though, both of y\u2019all come from genuine places from hurt and love. I\u2019m not a mom but I\u2019d say be patient with your daughter and allow room for growth. Your current husbands gotta be patient, it\u2019s tough and I bet he loves her as his own but Gracie\u2019s still hurt (that or your ex husband has poisoned her mind but I don\u2019t know) Godspeed op.", "NTA. This is tough\u2026. It\u2019s sad when a man really wants to step up and the child refuses to even try. Just out of curiosity - does she expect him to contribute financially to her college education if she chooses to go? Or does she expect him to allow her live with you guys rent free after she graduates? Is she happy accepting financial support from him, food or gifts? Roof over her head? Attempted emotional support? Because while she is angry over having him in her life and he\u2019s \u201cnot her real dad\u201d, she is also not his real daughter and he is technically not obligated to financially support her and there are men out there who actually refuse to care for children they did not make. So it could have been a lot worse. Just something to consider while she apparently has it so bad in her opinion. The fact that she also worshipped a man who walked out on his family to screw around instead of being a father is something she needs to understand. She is old enough for the truth. Maybe it will give her some perspective - your husband WANTS to be her family. Her father wasn\u2019t sure if he did. It might be a hard pill for her to swallow at first, but it might be what she needs to hear to move forward.", "Info: is she rude to him or just not as close as he would like?", "YTA - she\u2019s right, you picked him, she didn\u2019t. She doesn\u2019t have to. Stop trying to control her relationship with him. She will always be the driver of what that is, and if you truly love her, you\u2019ll accept her autonomy to decide that for herself.", "NAH\n\nI\u2019m sure it is difficult to be stuck between the two of them. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t force a relationship. You can ask her to include him more, and maybe she will for a bit, but it won\u2019t be for the right reasons. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what you were expecting from the court, but it\u2019s not their place to force a child to accept their stepparent. It would be one thing if she\u2019d been violent, but this is not a legal issue. \n\nAll you can do is hope for the best and maybe she\u2019ll come around. Maybe as she gets older and has experiences of her own, she will have a better understanding of relationships and how they aren\u2019t as black and white as she thinks they are.", "Nta, but I would suggest discussing if she would be open to family therapy, or even therapy for herself. Her father poisoned her opinion and mind against your now husband at an extremely formidable and impressionable age; all because the man was salty that you left him and found someone better.\n\nTherapy might help your daughter sort her feelings and maybe see that your husband merely wants to be there for her. However, if it doesn't, you and your husband might just have to hope she has an 'ah ha' moment and makes the first step.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA\n\nIt might be time to give Gracie a better perspective on your situation. Is there a family member or friend of her father\u2019s who knew his flaws, why your marriage ended, and what damage he caused afterwards? Perhaps you could ask them to talk with Gracie. Or perhaps you could do this for her. \n\nYou could also point out that even though her father was wrong to cause the issues he did, he may have changed had he lived longer. There is no reason to believe that he\u2019d want her to continue to act coldly and ignore your husband. If he couldn\u2019t be there for her, he might even want her to have a relationship with your husband and to have someone else to rely on.", "Instead of being the inbetween, has your husband tried anything to gain your daughters trust? Maybe he could go to her and ask if she needs help with anything or offer to take her out even for ice cream or something just the 2 of them. If you\u2019re pushing the situation then it will only push her away from you too so you need to let them create their own dynamic", "Nta,\n  And normally I am not for sharing with kids, but she was so young and it might be important to share some details about her dad, like wanting to have other women and such.  She probably thinks he is a Saint and that makes everything else hard.", "NTA. But as others have said you would be if you kept pushing. You chose this man not her. She isn\u2019t being rude she just doesn\u2019t want that relationship with him and that\u2019s fair.", "NTA. I don't get all the y t a votes saying you can't force a relationship. It didn't seem to me like you were, you just want Gracie to not be hurtful and exclusionary to your husband. She's old enough to know exactly what she's doing and sadly it seems your ex did a fantastic job of poisoning her against your husband.", "Soft YTA.\n\nYou cannot force love or affection. And she can get help with schoolwork from who she deems suitable.\n\nAlso, your daughter has been through a lot - her parents' divorce, subsequent court squabbles, then ultimately her father's death.\n\nI understand that your new husband might be a great guy, and that he's genuinely hurt, but to be blunt this isn't about him. You guys are the adults, she was/is still the child.\n\nAfter losing her bio dad, I don't think anyone will ever live up to that, tbh.  You mentioned twice you don't expect him to replace her dad, but certainly after his death, it may FEEL that way to her.\n\n\nI feel this is your answer: \"I chose to marry him, she didn't choose to have him in her life\".\n\nTo her, this was something forced on her, that she was never happy with. She's being polite for the sake of peace but there is no love there. Frankly, I don't think you can't change that at this point. At 17, if she hasn't warmed up to him - she likely won't.", "NAH.\n\nCan\u2019t call anybody an AH here. OP it stinks that Gracie could never accept your husband as a third parent or even an adult she could depend on.\n\nBut she 17 now and has made up her mind that your husband well always just be your husband and nothing else to her. You have accept that and just not it strain your relationship with her.\n\nAlso I would suggest talking with your husband and let him know that Grace may never have him be a part of her life and that her loss and he shouldn\u2019t take it to heart.\n\nFor your entire family, just let Grace make her decisions and respect them and nurture the relationship you have with her.", "NTA for talking to her about her relationship with your husband but YWBTA if you try to push it any further.      \nIt doesn't sound like she is rude to him or expressing anger towards him? They are just not clos,  and that is how step parent/child relationship is sometimes (and bio parent/child relationship for that matter).     She is 17, old enough to decide who she wants what kind of relationship with, and who she wants to text her news to. I understand that isn't what you and your husband had hoped for, but it is how it turned out and I think trying to forced a relationship now would only further alienate you daughter and husband.", "NTA. You may have to come to terms with the reality that your daughter is more like her father than you might be comfortable with.", "NTA\n\nHopefully as your daughter grows up and matures she'll realise what she has been like to her step father who sounds like he has not only tolerated a lot of her unwarranted disdain but also has been a good husband to you and a good father (and step father) to his kids.", "NTA. You\u2019re not forcing a parental relationship, you\u2019re asking for common decency and respect.\n\nI feel like she may forever be resistant because she may have conflated being respectful to him as being disrespectful to her father\u2019s memory.", "NTA\n\nI will say, that I am sorry for what you are going through.  I am not sure if she knows the whole story, or if it even matters to her.  I have seen a similar situation in my family before and it seems like logic goes right out the window.  I really hope she can mature and get past this.", "You did the wrong thing. You made choices for yourself, which is fine. But as she says, you can\u2019t then force choices upon her.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t love your husband. She doesn\u2019t want a relationship with your husband. She isn\u2019t being rude or hateful, she just doesn\u2019t want much to do with him. That\u2019s ok. Stop trying to force it or you\u2019ll drive her away.\n\nYTA.", "NTA\nYou need to realize that just because you live your husband doesn\u2019t mean that Gracie loves him. She may really like him but feel loyalty to her dad which keeps her from expressing it or she may just be indifferent to him despite the length of time he\u2019s been in her life.\n\nThe point to be mage is he\u2019s an adult who\u2019s helping pay her expenses and treating her with respect so she owes him respect in return .\n\nYou can\u2019t force her to love home but she must be polite and not exclude him. You can\u2019t ask her for anything more than that. \n\nHopefully as she matures she\u2019ll start to see his good qualities and develop a relationship but it\u2019s not something that you can force", "NTa. Your daughter is a shitty person for no reason. And once she\u2019s an adult it\u2019s probably going to all come back to haunt her. Karma is a bitch and it will come for her.  Also if she doesn\u2019t know the complete truth about the divorce it\u2019s time.", "NTA, Gracie is old enough to learn that people should be judged on the content of their character.   You can't force a relationship but she seems to put in the extra effort not to have one.", "I'm hesitating between NAH and NTA. \n\nHonnestly given everything your husband has done for her i fully understand how he feels and i get why you're on his side.\n\nOn the other side it is also true that feelings can't be forced and Gracie is obviously carrying untreated scars from her dad's passing, so i also kinda get her feelings...\n\nIt's very complicated and a hard situation for everyone invloved, i'd suggest family therapy if she agrees.", "You may want to get ready to go no contact with your daughter because I think that\u2019s what she is going to do since you come across as trying to push a relationship she doesn\u2019t want and the consequences for it is that Gracie will go no contact with you. So you may want to back down and not pick this hill to die on because it will only burn bridges more", "I'm going to say YTA because you keep pushing it even after she's made her feelings clear. Keep it up and you'll end up with an adult child who never talks to you.", "YTA. Sorry but it\u2019s ALWAYS the child\u2019s choice as to how close they want to be with a stepparent. Respect your daughter\u2019s wishes. Frankly your husband\u2019s feelings are secondary in this and you\u2019re not being a good mother by putting his feelings before your daughter\u2019s", "NTA.

She may not be including you husband like you would like but it doesn't sound like she is going out of her way to be rude or uncivil to him or at least you haven't given examples of her doing so.

Time to let it go.", "Soft YTA only because you are pressuring her and I doubt this is the first time.  She didn\u2019t choose your husband you did. Most you can ask for is respect and common decency. But she does not owe you or your husband a relationship. Even without the bio dad and his words some kids do not want another parent. Some do.

She's made it clear how she feels. Perhaps the reasons she feels that way are shitty reasons and it would be helpful for her to work on them with a therapist, but you do not get to overrule them. \n\nThere's nothing in your post that says they don't get along. Not including him in announcements of her milestones, or asking him for homework help, does not mean they don't get along. You are pushing them to be closer than she is comfortable with.

Denying a relationship with him might be the way she found to keep some control in her own life.

If that means she never feels she has the capacity to accept another father figure into her life, you should be supporting her still. If that means she needs to know it's OK for her to still be grieving and not ready to form relationships that feel like moving on, she should have your support. \n\nShe should not be being pressured to fit your ideal of a happy blended family.

She told you her position. You told her yours. You can't force her to have a relationship with someone she doesn't want. Would you want her staying with a partner she can't stand just because?  Nope. You'd tell her do what makes her happy. She's happy not having a relationship with your husband. The end. You pushing is actually making things worse.", "NAH\n\nThe problem here is that both of you are right.  Gracie has all rights to love her biological father, and not want anyone else in her life to fill that role.  She has been very clear, what kind of relationship she wants with him and that is as close to non as possible.  So if at an early age she pointed this out and has not changed, you need to accept that fact she will never accept him or view him or trust him.  That is on her.\n\nNow your point is true, you have tried to get her to accept him and see him to be someone she can trust.  While you are within your rights to be upset, the bottom line is that the final decision will be on her.  If she chooses not to have a relationship with him, there is nothing you can do, and just drop that topic fully.  Don't try to get her to accept him and let her be.\n\nWhen she turns 18, let her go, cause she is not wanting to be there.  But that also means that both of you need to accept that you may not be willing to be at her wedding or meet with any child she has.  Nor can she expect that your husband will be willing to say help pay for her college or help her out at all when she most needs it.\n\nYou and her one day may have to sit down and have a very adult conversation about her future and the relationship between the 2 of you.  That you will have to accept and respect that she will never see him as anything more than a stranger, and that is fine for her.

YTA you can\u2019t force a relationship like that. I understand your feelings because my mother was the same way. Unfortunately blended families don\u2019t always work out the way you want it too. It\u2019s isolating being the odd man out in your family, and while I\u2019m sure neither you or your husband ever wanted or intended to make her feel that way she probably does. It\u2019s your job to communicate with your husband not hers. And if she doesnt want to she shouldn\u2019t have too. Sure you can ask for respect, but you can\u2019t ask for a relationship she doesn\u2019t want. It isn\u2019t her responsibility to form that relationship to make you happy. You got remarried. You had more kids. She didn\u2019t chose that nor did she chose to be here.\n\nI\u2019m not saying it was wrong to do those things. You do deserve to be happy, and she knows that.

Maybe as an adult she\u2019ll figure out her emotions more and become more open, but you can\u2019t force it.", "Yta. Stop forcing their relationship and accept the fact that she will never see him as a parental figure, and that's perfectly OK.

My oldest daughter Gracie is from my first marriage. She's just turned 17. I have Milo 10 and Lyric 7 with my current husband. My ex-husband and I separated days after Gracie's first birthday because he told me he wanted to see other women and wanted me to wait for him. I did not and I filed for divorce. He always remained part of Gracie's life but he made it clear he only wanted me when it suited him. After the divorce I met my current husband. Gracie was 4 before she was introduced to him. Her dad was angry when I found someone else. He hated my husband and Gracie always knew it. I went through the courts when my ex would not stop badmouthing my husband to Gracie and did not leave her out of the adult issues we were having. The courts were not helpful at all and sent us to co-parenting classes. Gracie was hesitant with my husband. She adored her dad and didn't want him to feel hurt. This is something she told a therapist when she was young. Then when she was 8 her dad died and it feels like ever since then there was no way my husband could be anything to her. We never expected him to be her dad. But to be someone she trusts and cares about.\n\nGracie holds him at arms length and doesn't treat him like a member of her family. She doesn't include him like she does extended family. An example was last March. She was spotlighted in her art club. She sent a group chat message to me, both sets of grandparents and her uncles and aunts but did not include my husband. I mentioned it to my husband when I got home and she'd made it home before me and still hadn't told him. I brought it up to her and she said he wasn't on the need to know list for her.\n\nIt hurts my husband and I have tried to facilitate their relationship to be more but I don't think it was enough. A couple of days ago Gracie was saying she needed help with some engineering questions and she wanted to go over to my BIL's (sister's husband) brother's house to ask him some questions. I asked her why she had to go to all that trouble when my husband could have answered the questions for her. She said it made more sense to her to ask her uncle's brother. This is when I told her I don't like how she does that, how she treats my husband like he's not there, like he's not part of the family. I told her we never ever asked her to replace her dad or to consider them the same but she excludes him and keeps him out and he has only ever been kind to her. I told her it's something I would like her to work on. She got mad and told me I chose to marry him, she didn't choose to have him in her life. She also said it wasn't my business what their relationship is like. I told her I'm her mom and I love her, and I'm his wife and I love him and I just want them to get along. She's still angry at me and I'm trying to figure out if I did the wrong thing here.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NAH \n\nIt took me a long time to think of my stepdad as family.  My mom met him when I was 10 or 11 and was married to him shortly after.  We had an extremely contentious relationship, no fault of his own and just the situation, and it was not until I was in college and a bit more mature before we started to have a good relationship.  Give her time, don't force it, and understand the difficult situation she finds herself in and support both of them.\n\nI eventually grew to have a loving relationship with my stepdad. It's not too late for it to happen for your family as well even if it takes longer than you prefer.", "NAH- what you want is reasonable, but she may see it as being disloyal to her father. Who knows what all he said before he died.", "NAH  But it\u2019s time to respect her boundaries. She\u2019s 17. She\u2019s nearly an adult. The clock has run out on \u201craising\u201d her out of whatever her biological father got into her head, unfortunately. As painful as it is, if you want a relationship with your daughter *at all* it\u2019s time to back up.\n\nI know it\u2019s painful. My half sister and my dad are estranged for three decades now. The initial incident occurred when I was a child around something I did, so believe me I know how much it hurts when two people you love can\u2019t relate to each other. \n\nI can also say that bad advice from a well-respected psychologist deepened the divide, as both sides trusted him more than each other. Good therapy is a balm for the soul. Right now the wait time for therapy appointments is long and lots of therapists are leaving the profession. Your daughter is 17. You don\u2019t have years to find a good fit for both of you and build trust and work through 13 years of issues leading to this point before she\u2019s out the door.\n\nIt is my hope for both of you that she reconciles with your husband, the man that actually was there for her. I hope she\u2019s able to find therapy, or some form of care, that can help her heal from whatever is hurting her - be it her dad\u2019s death, or something he said to her, or her own ideas about loyalty or something else. I\u2019m sorry that both of you are in pain. But it\u2019s a bit late to begin with therapy together for this.", "NAH but I think the damage is done. I also think you have years of disappointment ahead of your family.", "NTA your ex is the complete AH in this situation. It sucks that he was able to influence the dynamic of your household even after death.", "NAH, so sorry for this situation.\nThe real AH was your ex, who didn't love you but still wanted to posses you...", "INFO: does Gracie know about why your relationship with her dad ended??\n\nNot to vilify him, but so she has a clear picture of the dynamics at play. She\u2019s almost and adult, so I think that\u2019s important to know.", "NTA", "NAH. I was the kid being manipulated like that by the father even though the other man was one of the nicest people I can imagine. Patient. Caring. Giving me space. He was still \"the enemy that ruined it all\".\n\n The older she gets the more she will realize and look for a neutral or better relationship with your husband. If not -dont take it personal even though it hurts. He is in her head.", "NTA. Love and respect something she's not interested in. At 17 not going to change. Don't waste your time.", "Your NTA but she is under no obligation to have a relationship with him at all though. You can ask her to be polite to him,but that's all.", "NTA for now. If you push this matter, then you become TA. I understand where you coming from, but all you can request is respect. Is she civil? Does she undermine your husband? If she is respectful, then that's it. The more you push it, the worse it will get. Sometimes children grow to care for step parents, and sometimes they don't. I feel for you, but you need to redpect you daughter's right to choose who she keeps close.", "NAH, but she is 17 and knows what she is doing. Ask her how she will feel if you are going to treat every future partner of her with the same exclusivness andignorance, bc YOU didn't decided to date them.", "NAH - I\u2019m in the same position as your husband. I met my step kid (SK) at the exact same age, and they are now the same age today. Bio mom has always picked and chose when they want to be a parent. SK just doesn\u2019t like me. Their mom did a pretty good job of alienating me from SK. Sometimes SK is nice, most of the time they aren\u2019t. I\u2019ve always emphasized I\u2019m not here to replace mom, but I do have a responsibility to ensure all of their needs are met when they are at my home. It\u2019s a bummer SK treats me like crap, but I\u2019m not going to hold it against them. \n\nI\u2019ve learned to not force the relationship, and to just tread lightly/respect boundaries. Don\u2019t want to have a relationship with me? Okay. If they change their mind later? Cool. \n\nDon\u2019t force it, you\u2019re only going to create more resentment and cause issues.", "NAH. I feel like you're all coming at a difficult situation from a position of genuinely having opposing views about it. You're clear you don't encourage or force your daughter to treat your husband like a father, and only want her to stop conspicuously excluding him. On the other hand, she's allowed to choose who she has a relationship with and if she's chosen not to engage with your husband as a family member then that's her right to do so.\n\nHowever, it's completely reasonable that you would feel hurt by this. The man is your husband, not some random joe from the street, and seeing your almost adult daughter act like he doesn't exist must suck. You have every right to say, honestly, that it hurts you. I don't think pushing it further than that and attempting to bridge the gap when at least one of the parties doesn't want that is appropriate. It's just a bad situation all round and I don't know if there's a simple solution. I think your daughter would respect you respecting her decision regarding your husband.", "NTA of course.  You sound like a loving mom, and break ups are not easy for kids, they all take it in different ways.  Clearly your ex made her feel like if she let your husband into her life, it would be a betrayal to him.  What an awful thing to do as a parent.  You did nothing wrong and you could not control that he did that.  And now that he is dead, he is forever immortalized as the perfect dad.  \n\nIt seems impossible, since she was so young when your husband became a part of the family, and it would seem this many years later things would have ironed out, but I think just keep slowly trying to infiltrate her own mind yourself.  Repeating the idea that loving your husband and letting him in is not a betrayal to her dad.  Love isn't finite it can be given without limit.  I hope she will come around for your and your husband's sake.", "Put the emotions aside. Point out practical application. He feeds her, clothes her, puts a roof over her head and at least partially finances' things she wants. He may even end up paying for her higher education. She doesn't have to love him, but she HAS to respect him. And she should show gratefulness. These are the minimum behaviors expected. Her feelings can't be corrected but her behavior can be corrected at least to some degree.", "NTA - Whatever your Ex told your daughter really tainted her view of her husband. Does she know the real reason you two broke up? For her to actively ignore/unincluded your husband she must have been told some horrendous things.", "YTA and here\u2019s why. She has stated by thought, deed and action that she wants nothing to do with your husband and you hold on to this fantasy that maybe, just maybe she will change her mind. She won\u2019t. She loved her father and any fatherly relationship by anyone but him is a betrayal in her mind. \n\nShe avoids him at all costs. She never thinks of him. He is a peripheral character in her life and will always be that to her. \n\nYou have to get right with it. She isn\u2019t changing. Please don\u2019t get any ideas of him walking her down the aisle or making a dad speech at her wedding. That isn\u2019t what she wants. She has made a family of her choosing and her stepfather isn\u2019t a part of it. \n\nShe is being consistent with it as well. She doesn\u2019t ask him for help, she doesn\u2019t expect him to do anything for her. You have these expectations and it is going to kill your relationship with your daughter.\n\nAlso, why do you care so much? Your husband has you and his kids that he can be awesome too. Why are you trying to force this so much. What do you get out of them having a relationship? What does he get out of it? What does she get out of it? \n\nSome people just don\u2019t warm up to people at all and Gracie has enough sense of self to say nope, not interested. She isn\u2019t trying to ruin your marriage or anything like that she just doesn\u2019t engage. That\u2019s reasonable as well.", "NTA.  It's pretty obvious  your ex has a hand in this.  I'm thinking it may be time to tell Gracie what actually happened in the divorce.  At 17, she'd old enough to hear it.", "YTA. Your daughter is correct. You chose your husband, she did not.\n\nIf it was that important to you for your daughter to have a relationship with your current husband.  You should not have married him until your daughter loved him like family.\n\nShe is almost 18. Lost one parent and now you are making your husband's feelings a priority. Your daughter must feel betrayed and abandoned right now.", "YTA. She's not comfortable with your husband. You can't force a relationship. She isn't actively telling him to leave or saying rude things. She just prefers not to talk to him or tell him about her life. That's called a boundary. Some people don't even tell these things to their real parents.", "NAH.\n\nShe's also *only* 17 years old. Give this time and don't harass her about it; the best way for your husband to win her favor is to respect Gracie's boundaries. Don't push, just make it clear that if she ever changes her mind, the door is open for them to get closer.\n\nAlso keep in mind that *lots* of older teen girls keep their father's at an arm's length. My sister was always a \"daddy's girl\" right up until she discovered boys and then took a decade-long hiatus. She just wanted to figure out who she was without dealing with an overprotective father figure. But now that she's married and has kids, our dad is back to being a major fixture in her life.\n\nSo your husband isn't missing out to an abnormal degree. \"Polite but distant\" is a good sign, even if it makes you sad to see. So long as everyone keeps being civil and respectful, there's potential for them to have a great relationship once your daughter becomes an adult.", "I say NTA. \n\nI have never been in this situation or anything like it so i won\u2019t pretend to relate or directly understand, but i sympathize that these all sound like natural reactions to just a hard situation.\n\nI am sorry daughter and husband do not get along, but i would work on coaching her to at least be civil. Being civil with undesired company will get you so far in life, it\u2019s just a great lesson to instill, but i am sorry it is at the expense of personal relationships in your life.", "YTA ~ your child doesn\u2019t want a relationship with this man. This man is your person, not hers. Stop trying to make her have a relationship shes been quite clear about not wanting. A forced relationship isn\u2019t going to benefit anyone. As long as shes respectful toward him and not being openly cruel, let her be.", " NTA but neither is your daughter, it\u2019s time for you and your husband to redefine his relationship with your daughter.  For his own mental health, he can be open to maybe having a relationship one day but he needs to figure out how to navigate not having a relationship with her and so do you.  That may mean he spends more time with his kids and that may mean that you go alone to her things and he takes the other kids out to do something fun.", "NTA. Grace needs help..", "NTA\n\nExisting kids and new relationships are hard, even when that relationship reaches the point you get engaged and marry again so it's not \"new\".\n\nYou can only do so much except support both. You love your Husband, you love your Daughter - the relationship between them though is between the two of them, interfering and pushing one way or another is not going to lead to positive results.\n\nTime and effort, being how he appears to have been which is not pushing things is the best he can do for now - if the two bond due to either life events or activities is up to them.\n\nIt likely hasn't helped how your Late ex Husband spoke with your daughter, one can hope over time as she gets older, matures and gains her own perspective on things that she'll end up accepting him more.\n\nYWBTA if you try to force, push or unduly encourage the two of them to do anything and I think you've hit the wall with your comments here:\n\n>I told her I'm her mom and I love her, and I'm his wife and I love him and I just want them to get along.\n\nThis is fair, this is reasonable and good - you've been honest and made it clear what you're after.\n\n>She's still angry at me and I'm trying to figure out if I did the wrong thing here.\n\nNow I'm no Paediatric Psychologist, but bear with me while I do my best to share what I can from experience and not getting a Degree :)\n\nYou haven't \"done\" anything wrong, many kids just want their parents to be together and won't understand the intricacies of adult relationships, love and the library of emotions, logic and sensibilities that go into things.\n\nFrom a generic perspective - many kids (up to a certain age and there are exceptions) don't understand the depths of things beyond \"My Mother and Father aren't together\" alongside the tirade of faults this brings up - \"I don't _want_ to live in a different place when I'm with Mum/Dad\" with the inevitable \"Why can't you just be together so we can be a family again\" type questions.\n\nIf either parent has influenced or pushed things by involving the child in drama, in effect \"pre-baking\" certain concepts like \"Mum's new Boyfriend isn't nice\" etc, this makes things far more complicated and harder to keep the child from taking a different view.\n\nLuckily (though arguably sadly for some!) kids aren't kids forever and eventually grow up.\n\nProvided that your Husband demonstrates consistently open, pleasant behaviour and keeps the door open for experiences together, activities or just general life-involvement, when the time comes for your Daughter to want to test the waters, she won't be left with any shortage of enthusiasm from your Husband.\n\nTL;DR here is, what is already happening is fine, but don't push it harder.", "NTA, but there is a lot at play here. \nIt sounds like maybe she feels she is betraying her father by including a man in her life he openly disliked.

It might be worth finding ways to help her honor her dad and keep him alive in her life and then opening the door to having other ways of bonding with your husband.

Seventeen year olds are in a messy part of a journey. If you read Reddit much you see this type of relationship issue all the time. You and your husband are doing all the right things.

She grew up with two people she loved divorced and angry. Then one died.  I think it would be very surprising if she wasn't a mess right now.  Just keep loving her, keep including both she and your husband.  If possible, find some way to recognize the fact that she loved and misses her father  and may feel lonely in that fact.

The fact that a loving parent would not deny their child an additional person to support them and love them, even if they were anxious/angry about being replaced, especially when they are at fault for ending the marriage.\n\nI suggest working with a therapist to word it as sympathetically as possible, so that Gracie does not feel you are just attacking her dad. \n\nOtherwise just keep being patient and try not to let it affect your relationship with Gracie.

It's hard for her because she has lost this person she loves and she just wants her mother and OG father to be in love and together (17 is still a child) and for him to be remembered and spoken of in a good light. She is probably still grieving and has lost someone who loved her and was in her corner. Go easy on her because your husband is probably a symbol of all that she's lost and a future with her dad she'll never have.", "NAH. You both need to sit down and talk.

I\u2019m a child of divorce too and I totally understand where Gracie is coming from. Family is tough, especially with such a huge loss as a kid. It\u2019s hard to accept a new adult into your intimate family life, no matter how great of a person and a parent they are. Especially if the new adult brought new kids into the picture. It\u2019s not uncommon for kids of divorce with half siblings to resent the new parent and siblings and think of them as \u2018ruining\u2019 the original family unit. Losing a family unit comes with grief, even if both parents are still in the child\u2019s life. With the death of a parent thrown into the mix, that adds even more complications. How old was she when her father died? How did she handle her grief? It\u2019s possible that unresolved grief is preventing Gracie from forming the close relationship you want her to have with your new husband. BUT that isn\u2019t necessarily Gracie\u2019s fault. Grief is HARD to deal with for people of all ages. \nI\u2019m an adult now in my mid/late 20\u2019s and I still don\u2019t have close relationships with all of my blended family. There are probably parts of my blended family that wish we were closer and that I talked to them more/was more forthcoming but there\u2019s just so much history there.

Did Gracie ever say what her dad said (outside of her dad expressing that he'd rather Gracie not have a relationship with her stepdad)?", "Why are you trying to force it then", "I think you need to sit down and talk to your daughter as the young woman and near adult that she is.\r  \nBut first you and your husband need to accept that she doesn't want to treat your husband as her family. Stop reacting to her behaviour regarding that. Just ignore it, don't question it, don't push it, let her decide who she wants to involve in her life and homework.\r  \nAnd then she needs to go to therapy both with and without you.\r  \n\r  \nWhen she's seen that you and your husband no longer forces or even adresses the issue, then you need to sit her down in a calm moment without your husband or anyone else there and tell her that now that she's almost an adult you need to tell her why you and her dad divorced, how he treated you, how he expected you to sit at home with your baby and faithfully wait for him while he cheated on you and broke your heart. And then when you didn't accept being treated like that and moved on with your life without him, finding another man who wanted to be faithful to you, your ex then emotionally abused you and your daughter by telling her viscious things and lies which angered, saddened and hurt her in order to hurt and punish you and sabotage your relationsship with your daughter, complicate your new relationship, and obstruct your daughter's possible relationship with your husband as well as her half-siblings.\r  \nYour ex-husband was an abuser; he emotionally abused you and your daughter simply because he couldn't accept not getting his way.\r  \nI disagree with your therapists, she is old enough now to learn the truth.\r  \nShe loves her dad and besides the constant verbal emotional abuse he may have been a great dad to her. Although I doubt it, a person who can be so selfish, verbally and emotionally abusive, vindictive and destructive usually are pretty worthless parents. She was just too young and the information was withheld from her so she couldn't form her own informed opinion then. She needs all the information now.\r  \nI'm saying this as a person whose dad was a selfish man who abused his children in order to punish his ex-wife, my mother, for not staying with him when he was a terrible husband and worthless father who didn't care about anyone but himself.\r  \nThe truth will set you free.", "Not asking him for homework help isn't being disrespectful", "Harsh views as in religion, social issues politics???all of that is a big turn off to teens", "Oh I agree! Just no one is 100% innocent hope they all get therapy.", "might also be an option. Tbh at 17 I think she is old enough to know the truth.", "Ok, thank you for answering, that does paint a clearer picture.", "Words of wisdom right here\\~", "This is an excellent point.", "Unfortunately since Gracie already knows her mom's sentiments on the matter, it will be hard to separate the two. Gracie wants to believe her dad is a good person and OP has given her a perfect justification to dismiss anything she says about the divorce. The first question to overcome would be why the circumstances of the divorce are relevant 8 years after dad died and 14/15 years (I forget) after the divorce itself...the first thought will likely be that they want to make dad look bad.", "Even if they're not pushing for father figure, she might FEEL that if she accepts him, she's betraying her dad.\n\nAlso kids are people, and sometimes people just do not click. It's possible that, for whatever reason, she just doesn't get on well with the new husband at all.\n\nI agree that living with someone so long and not having a relationship is...weird. But there reasons might be complex, multitude and more than we can deduce from this post.", "Treating them like a member of family doesn't mean you have to have a close relationship, it just means acknowledging that they exist and should be involved in family events lmao.\n\nIntentionally excluding your almost decade long stepfather from family events for things that are no fault of his own is the definition of disrespectful and uncivil.\n\nIt's resentment and it's obvious to anyone who is on the receiving end of the behaviour.", "None of that.", "You are aware that most divorced people don't badmouth the other parent to their child, yes? The fact that you feel it necessary to rudely argue otherwise is telling. So here we go: most grown ups behave like grown ups and don't throw tantrums in front of their children. If you find it hard to understand, you're one of the tantrum throwers and need to grow up.", "The advice several people have given to cover this topic in therapy is wise. Nobody should tell a young child that they divorced because dad wanted to have affairs and expected wife to just accept that. But by 17 she\u2019s old enough to know that the divorce was not OP\u2019s fault. It\u2019s likely dad told her a full lie about why they separated, and OP has evidently never even given Gracie an age appropriate explanation. \n\nGracie may never be more than polite to husband. But if she\u2019s holding a grudge because she thinks dad was a saint and mom left him for dh, that- at least- should be corrected.", "Definitely.", "Especially as she now lived with them for 9 years without his influence.", "I had a similar situation between my parents where I didn't even meet my dad until I was 23. I had only my mom's word that he was an asshole who wanted nothing to do with me. It wasn't until I reunited with him that I was able to look, maybe not objectively, but more critically, at my mom's behavior, and form my own opinions. At 17 I was definitely not capable of doing such when it came to my dad. I just wasn't strong enough as a person yet.\n\nMy point is, not every one is capable of having their own opinions at that age. I certainly wasn't.", "It\u2019s possible something happened that OP doesn\u2019t know about. The post was very slim on info about interaction with her husband and her daughter. \n\nIt\u2019s also possible that Gracie feels that acting this way toward her mothers husband is a way to stay loyal to her dad\u2019s memory. The kid needs therapy, not so that she\u2019ll accept OP\u2019s husband, but so she can really process her relationship with her dad, his flaws, and how to move on with her own opinions and beliefs without feeling like it\u2019s a betrayal.", "OP also said it\u2019s engineering homework but doesn\u2019t even say what the uncles brother or her husband do. Are they both engineers? Or is she asking for help from the engineer while your husband is not one?", "Her mom's family is technically *her* family. He's her stepfather; last I checked, stepparents were still part of one's family.", ">New hubby needs to show her with his actions every single day. He needs to do the work.\n\nThere comes a point where he is no longer obligated to try. Once she's an adult if she still treats him like he isn't family it's perfectly reasonable for him to write her off.", "She needs to know", "Being left off of an info-blast is hardly being excluded from family events.", "I think we often forget what it means to be young, though. As adults, when we don't like someone...we can leave relationships, end friendships, change jobs. As a child, you are often put in  situation where you HAVE to live with people you dislike because they are family (by marriage).", "You\u2019re not being very specific though.   What exactly does your husband want that he\u2019s not getting?", "I agree with doing it through therapy and even that the dad may have lied to his daughter. I'm just saying the daughter would be more likely to believe OP if she hadn't already made it clear she wants her daughter to be closer to DH. Even if something is told to you in therapy, you're less likely to believe it if you think the other party has ulterior motives. In a year or a few months depending on her birthday, daughter can't be forced to continue therapy  so she may quit before they make much headway.\n\nObviously OP can only proceed from here and can't change what she has already told her daughter. I'm just saying she needs to be aware of all possibilities including her daughter rejecting the truth and her.", "Also sometimes it's hard.\n\nMy dad's first marriage broke down.  I'm the child of his 2nd marriage.\n\nTurns out the story I heard from my parents, wasn't quite the story my halfsibling (who grew up with their mom) had heard. There are overlaps, but also significant differences. (Most notably, in the version I heard, she cheated).\n\nTo this day, I actually do not know the full truth. He might have lied; She might have lied. The truth might be in the middle. Either way, I wasn't born then yet, I'll likely never know.\n\nI think realistically, in these things, we side with the person we're closer to.", "That was exactly my thought on the issue. Dad\u2019s not here anymore. The only way she can honor him now is keeping stepdad out.", "Or that if she tried to have a relationship with him, she would be dishonouring her father's memory.", "Plus OP states that she had to go to court to try and get her ex from talking crap about her new husband; that is not a minor thing. So I bet Grace heard all this stuff, probably mostly untrue, about stepdad and nothing is going to change her mind.\n\nI wonder if it is worth it to talk to Grace about WHY they divorced; maybe hearing that would help?", "Excellent point. She may feel disloyal if she gives in.  This could change as she matures, but if it doesn't be grateful for the relationship you had with her and don't try to force her to love him.", ">It\u2019s possible something happened that OP doesn\u2019t know about. The post was very slim on info about interaction with her husband and her daughter.\n\nIt is. Also I've noticed OP gave NO concrete examples of how he tried to bond, just that he tried. \n\nAnd I agree with the latter. And I think it's time to tell her why they divorced.", "OP specified in another answer they are in the same field, I think.", "Legally, sure. But you can\u2019t force someone to build a relationship or have familial feelings.", "But she's not an adult. And yes, I agree, he can write her off. That will likely be a pretty major hurdle for his wife's relationship with her daughter though. And he'll always be the guy that gave up on his kid. That doesnt wash off.", "Same here. I don't know that there is a lot that the stepdad can do to compete with a ghost (and, in this case, a ghost that hated him).", "Also your username makes me giggle. \ud83d\ude02", "No. You can't force it. But after all this time if she's still acting this way because of her dad running his mouth then she needs to grow up and get a clue", "We're talking about a hypothetical future here.  She's not an adult yet, but she will be. \n\nIf it gets to the point where she is an adult and wants no relationship with him, he would be giving up on establishing a meaningful relationship with an adult daughter of his wife who never cared to give him a chance. I doubt OPs daughter would care. If she takes offense to his indifference, well that's a her problem.\n\nHe would owe her cordiality, and that's about it. She's made it abundantly clear she is not his \"kid\" and that is unlikely to change. When it becomes a matter of two adults, it would be hypocritical to expect him to put in work every day and get no effort in return.", "The post is about her liking your husband or including him  at least. She went to therapy and it didn't help. She may work through her issues but still maintain her distance...", "Him wanting to be with other women and then telling her to wait, then getting mad when she gets a new partner should make his ability to be a good partner questionable.", "These two things are related. He badmouthed stepdad because he wanted to sleep around but he expected OP to be alone and celibate forever. Just because he's not alive anymore doesn't mean OP has an obligation to falsely uphold his reputation when he tried to weaponize Gracie to undermine OP's relationship and happiness. The truth is the truth.", "Why thank you!", "But she is not an adult. \n\nLook up Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). There is a statistical link between kids who experience childhood traumas and their ability to cope and form healthy relationships later in life. The fact that she \"rejected\" her mother's new spouse, ESPECIALLY after her father DIED, is normal and expected. You cant possibly expect her to know how to navigate any of that alone, it's the job of her parent(s) to get her help and LEARN about what shes going through. Instead, they're bitter and they compound her trauma with guilt.", "Her point was to not have her daughter being so exclusive of his presence, not for her to have a father-like bond with OP's husband. There's a scale of behaviour between being deliberately exclusive and generally amicable and one would presume that sorting through issues of why she's acting resentful would also mean that she would be less exclusive. You can't say you've worked through feelings of resentment if you still act with resentment lmao."]}
