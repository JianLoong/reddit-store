You knew she didn't want the kid to watch tv and you deliberately undermined that as a way to stick it to her.     You obviously wanted to get a dig in because this is a sibling rivalry issue, not a parenting issue, and that, alone, makes you a big asshole.  Whether or not toddlers should watch tv is beside the point. (That being said, in terms of official advice by every reputable child health and wellness organization?

If you can't follow them, don't offer. And especially don't hide your intentions, then get insulted when she's justifiably upset.

Honestly, these problems could have been avoided had you two just had a discussion about expectations before babysitting.\n\nIf she is strict about what foods her child eats, then she should have provided a snack for the time he spent at your home. But it also sounds like you knew she wouldn't have approved of your snack choice, and you chose to feed your nephew it anyway. \n\nAs for Bluey, you thought you were doing your best in keeping both children safe and entertained, even though you knew tv was a no-no. Your sister thought you were deliberately undermining her again.\n \nShe's frustrated that you didn't respect her parenting. You're frustrated that she didn't appreciate the help you offered. \n\nI legit think this isn't a matter of either of you being AHs, but both of you are struggling with the pressures of being new moms. You should give yourselves and each other the grace you both deserve as new parents. When you're both calmer, just have a chat about it, apologize, and move on.

You knew the rules that your sister has in regards to TV. \n\nI saw a comment where you asked what you should do instead of tv, you could have sat and played with the kids instead of plopping them in front of the TV.

And again, idk what your sis is planning on the no cartoons thing, I dont think it's entirely bad as long as she doesn't ban it most of his childhood.

But 1-year-olds will not be benefited. While one episode won't do anything, making it a regular thing isn't good. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says that children under 18 months should have no exposure to screens. Children that young won't take away any of the lessons taught. Screen time at that age can mess up their sleep, and their capacity to pay attention. It can also have a negative effect on their language skills.", "It 100% doesn't matter at that age what is going on in the show or how wholesome it is. Under 2 they won't learn anything from it, they won't understand what is going on at all just stay hypnotised by the moving colors and get overstimulated. And there is enough research saying there are concerns about development, because they aren't doing what their brain needs (like exploring with their hands and mouth) and it also negatively affects their sleep. It also correlates with delayed language because it allows carers to leave them alone for extanded period of times with no interaction (it's much harder for a baby to learn words from TV than from a person speaking to them due to how the brain works).  Under 2 even the best show in the world is a net negative for development because it's simply not what a baby brain needs.\n\nSorry for the long comment, TL;DR is watching TV once isn't going to do any real harm, but the sister's concern around screen time are perfectly valid even with wholesome quality shows.", "I don't let my four year old watch Bluey.  There is a lot of them teasing each other and kinda encouraging kids to be mean to their parents.  It's hard to tell if the parents are playing pretend or being hurt sometimes and it doesn't really seem to sell much compassion.  I'm a big fan of Daniel Tiger as it actually does teach lessons in little songs that toddlers actually pick up on. Dora is also very kind and educational.  It is so hard to teach toddlers hands are not for hitting - I don't let my kid watch anything with any bulling or pushing, which there is some of in Bluey.", "He\u2019s not even 2. Toddlers are prone to get into trouble. It\u2019s common sense to watch small children.", "This again, calling your sister \"weird\". Just because you don't share her opinions on food doesn't mean you can overrule her?\n\nFYI every single time I've babysat my niece and nephew I've checked with one of the parents what was ok to feed them. Every single time one of my kids has been invited to a friend's house, the parents have checked with me if there were things they shouldn't eat. At a young age it's 100% normal babysitting etiquette to check in with the parents on things like food (and screen time definitely too under the age of 3).\n\nWhy do you think because you're offering to watch the kid for a few hours you can just go ahead and undermine her?", "I'm curious, what exactly did you feed him?", "NTA. You sister should have provided her sons meal and snacks if she feels so strongly about what he eats.", "Thinking you need to watch a 17 month old at all times - (especially in public!) doesn\u2019t make you a helicopter mom.  At all.  It makes you a responsible parent.\n\nThe fact that you disagree probably says a lot more about your parenting skills than hers.", "You keep reiterating the 'helicopter mom' insult, so I think you should just bug out of their business. You're not doing her any real good by offering \"favors\" and disregarding what you know full well are her concerns, while judging her so much. Just leave her alone and let her do whatever she's gonna do.\n\nMy perspective here comes from knowing an acquaintance who likes to sugar up everybody else's kids because she doesn't work outside the home and only has littles too young for school.... So she is fine with her own house being in total chaos and kids being up till 11 at night, since nobody has to be anywhere in the morning. Which is fine for her. But she thinks the rest of us are really \"uptight\" and often makes snide hints to that judgy effect... but its really just that we actually have to get our kids to school and our selves to outside jobs in the morning. \n\nThat's may not be what's going on here, but my point is that insults like \"helicopter mom\" are really your interpretation and, especially since she didn't actually ask you to babysit, it's best you just respect her own way and leave her to it. Whatever the dynamics are, she knows her own life better than you", "Or the fact that hair salons can be dangerous for a small child that is super active like you said.
