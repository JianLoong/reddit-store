But 1-year-olds will not be benefited. While one episode won't do anything, making it a regular thing isn't good. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says that children under 18 months should have no exposure to screens. Children that young won't take away any of the lessons taught. Screen time at that age can mess up their sleep, and their capacity to pay attention. It can also have a negative effect on their language skills.", "It 100% doesn't matter at that age what is going on in the show or how wholesome it is. Under 2 they won't learn anything from it, they won't understand what is going on at all just stay hypnotised by the moving colors and get overstimulated. And there is enough research saying there are concerns about development, because they aren't doing what their brain needs (like exploring with their hands and mouth) and it also negatively affects their sleep. It also correlates with delayed language because it allows carers to leave them alone for extanded period of times with no interaction (it's much harder for a baby to learn words from TV than from a person speaking to them due to how the brain works).  Under 2 even the best show in the world is a net negative for development because it's simply not what a baby brain needs.\n\nSorry for the long comment, TL;DR is watching TV once isn't going to do any real harm, but the sister's concern around screen time are perfectly valid even with wholesome quality shows.", "I don't let my four year old watch Bluey.  There is a lot of them teasing each other and kinda encouraging kids to be mean to their parents.  It's hard to tell if the parents are playing pretend or being hurt sometimes and it doesn't really seem to sell much compassion.  I'm a big fan of Daniel Tiger as it actually does teach lessons in little songs that toddlers actually pick up on. Dora is also very kind and educational.  It is so hard to teach toddlers hands are not for hitting - I don't let my kid watch anything with any bulling or pushing, which there is some of in Bluey.", "He\u2019s not even 2. Toddlers are prone to get into trouble. It\u2019s common sense to watch small children.", "This again, calling your sister \"weird\". Just because you don't share her opinions on food doesn't mean you can overrule her?\n\nFYI every single time I've babysat my niece and nephew I've checked with one of the parents what was ok to feed them. Every single time one of my kids has been invited to a friend's house, the parents have checked with me if there were things they shouldn't eat. At a young age it's 100% normal babysitting etiquette to check in with the parents on things like food (and screen time definitely too under the age of 3).\n\nWhy do you think because you're offering to watch the kid for a few hours you can just go ahead and undermine her?", "I'm curious, what exactly did you feed him?", "[deleted]", "Thinking you need to watch a 17 month old at all times - (especially in public!) doesn\u2019t make you a helicopter mom.  At all.  It makes you a responsible parent.\n\nThe fact that you disagree probably says a lot more about your parenting skills than hers.", "You keep reiterating the 'helicopter mom' insult, so I think you should just bug out of their business. You're not doing her any real good by offering \"favors\" and disregarding what you know full well are her concerns, while judging her so much. Just leave her alone and let her do whatever she's gonna do.\n\nMy perspective here comes from knowing an acquaintance who likes to sugar up everybody else's kids because she doesn't work outside the home and only has littles too young for school.... So she is fine with her own house being in total chaos and kids being up till 11 at night, since nobody has to be anywhere in the morning. Which is fine for her. But she thinks the rest of us are really \"uptight\" and often makes snide hints to that judgy effect... but its really just that we actually have to get our kids to school and our selves to outside jobs in the morning. \n\nThat's may not be what's going on here, but my point is that insults like \"helicopter mom\" are really your interpretation and, especially since she didn't actually ask you to babysit, it's best you just respect her own way and leave her to it. Whatever the dynamics are, she knows her own life better than you", "Or the fact that hair salons can be dangerous for a small child that is super active like you said.

I'd be the exact same about screens with my toddler.", "Okay. As a seasoned mom: you two have different parenting styles, not one is better than the other, they are what works for you independently. You need to let go of your internal judgement of what your sister is doing independently with no relation to you about parenting. She\u2019s doing what she thinks is right, you\u2019re doing what you think is right. You\u2019re both going to fuck up your kids in ways you can\u2019t even dream about. Sounds messed up, but it\u2019s true. Your child will grow to be resentful to you for some reason, as will hers to her. Period. There is no perfect or right way to parent. \n\nYou both owe each other an apology and a truce to back off of judging each other regarding parenting. You also need to discuss being respectful of each other\u2019s parenting styles. If y\u2019all are to ever be in the care of the other\u2019s child again, you need some boundaries. Your child shouldn\u2019t have to change how he lives in his zone and her child shouldn\u2019t have to change the way he lives in his zone. However: compromise can be made. Adjustments can be made. \n\nI\u2019ll give you an example\u2026 when my kids go to someone else\u2019s home, and they are more generous with junk food, I say nothing. That\u2019s an experience they have there, and they enjoy it. When they go to a friend\u2019s and there is no junk food there, I say nothing. That\u2019s also an experience they have there, and they enjoy it. And when friends come over, I have my rules in place that aren\u2019t the same as their home, and they still enjoy it. This has been going on since they were toddlers. Have I been secretly judgy to others? Yes. But as time has gone on, I\u2019ve practiced empathy and kindness in general, and realized that we\u2019re all just doing our damn best as parents- there is not a manual to produce a perfect child. Grow up and stop judging her and yourself. In the end, they\u2019re going to lick the fucking floors in public spaces and none of it fucking matters.", "None of that is weird and it\u2019s also not helicopter parenting. Your sister making reasonable decisions about her baby is just parenting and you deliberately undermined her choices.", "She may be a helicopter Mom but you could have followed her rules for a few hours. Your son didn't need to have a fruit pouch and probably wouldn't have noticed not having one. \n\nNow for a major issue here..If she's as bad as you say someday she'll regret it.

You put that so well.", "If it\u2019s just fruit there\u2019s no added sugar. It\u2019s not like juice, it still has the fiber because it\u2019s just blended whole fruit.

I have a whole pouch maker to make my own at home but get off your high horse.", "Clearly", "If you're going to offer to watch someone's kid, follow their rules. It's not that hard. If you can't handle watching a kid for a day without using screens or feeding them junk *when they had appropriate food sent with them,* then you're not cut out to watch two kids and should not offer to do it.", "I have been left alone with multiple children before and screen time is a NO. There are multiple studies on how screen time is bad for young children and yet you people just straight up go and ignore it. Your kid turned out fine? Great! But it was still wrong on your part. Attention deficit is a terrible issue and I have it precisely due to screen time exposure.\n\nIn the end, it's her sisters child. If the sister gave OP rules to follow then OP HAS TO FOLLOW.\n\nYou wouldn't be very thrilled if you left your child with someone who, for example, left them undressed for hours because to them it's normal while you, on the other hand, clearly stated that you want your kid with at least the bare minimum of clothing. Would you?\n\nHeck, OP is the asshole even without this whole TV thing because the sister gave OP food for HER baby and not OPs kid. OP thought it looked gross and yet, after seeing that her sister's kid liked it, decided to use that same food to feed her child with and then complained \"it wasn't enough for both of them\", when the food was NOT for her kid but for her sister's kid.", "Yeah, she belittles her sister as a helicopter mother but clearly uses the old gogglebox as a babysitter for her 17 month old and fills them full of sweets. At least her sister engages with her child. \n\nOP really needs to take a look in the mirror because she keeps this up she\u2019s going to end up with fat lump of a couch potato child who battles obesity their entire life.", "Exactly. Its bizarre that people are taking her side. What if her nephew was being screened for allergies. She can't just make the decision to feed him whatever. Especially when he came with a packed lunch. As a previous child care worker, this is the dream. OP went out of her way to make poor choices", "Most of those do have added sugar.

If health is your priority, those shouldn\u2019t be a regular occurrence either. Especially since it\u2019s cheaper to make them at home.\n\nPoint is that it\u2019s not just fruit in most cases. If you read through the ingredients they often add juice and other hidden, artificial sugar. Additionally, you\u2019re feeding your child micro plastic and the fruits and vegetables used for these pouches and glasses are often not the best. \n\nIf you want to give your child those things that\u2019s your business.

She didn't even bother to ask.", "Honestly it\u2019s just fruit and lemon juice for preservation in most baby fruit sauces. I agree if the mother didn\u2019t want her child eating it OP should not have given it to the child, but you are totally on a high horse. Any sweet fruit juice is bad for kids. I don\u2019t care if you fresh squeezed it or not. If you feel so strongly about added sugar you shouldn\u2019t make your own juice. On that note, the American academy of pediatrics recommends against feeding kids unpasteurized fruit juice. Also, It\u2019s full of sugar and all the fiber has been removed. Which means, it leads to weight gain and dental cavities.. As far as micro plastics go they have even been found in raw honey, not sure why you think it can be avoided by not eating apple sauce from a pouch.
