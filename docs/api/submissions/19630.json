But 1-year-olds will not be benefited. While one episode won't do anything, making it a regular thing isn't good. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says that children under 18 months should have no exposure to screens. Children that young won't take away any of the lessons taught. Screen time at that age can mess up their sleep, and their capacity to pay attention. It can also have a negative effect on their language skills.", "It 100% doesn't matter at that age what is going on in the show or how wholesome it is. Under 2 they won't learn anything from it, they won't understand what is going on at all just stay hypnotised by the moving colors and get overstimulated. And there is enough research saying there are concerns about development, because they aren't doing what their brain needs (like exploring with their hands and mouth) and it also negatively affects their sleep. It also correlates with delayed language because it allows carers to leave them alone for extanded period of times with no interaction (it's much harder for a baby to learn words from TV than from a person speaking to them due to how the brain works).  Under 2 even the best show in the world is a net negative for development because it's simply not what a baby brain needs.\n\nSorry for the long comment, TL;DR is watching TV once isn't going to do any real harm, but the sister's concern around screen time are perfectly valid even with wholesome quality shows.", "I don't let my four year old watch Bluey.  There is a lot of them teasing each other and kinda encouraging kids to be mean to their parents.  It's hard to tell if the parents are playing pretend or being hurt sometimes and it doesn't really seem to sell much compassion.  I'm a big fan of Daniel Tiger as it actually does teach lessons in little songs that toddlers actually pick up on. Dora is also very kind and educational.  It is so hard to teach toddlers hands are not for hitting - I don't let my kid watch anything with any bulling or pushing, which there is some of in Bluey.", "He\u2019s not even 2. Toddlers are prone to get into trouble. It\u2019s common sense to watch small children.", "This again, calling your sister \"weird\". Just because you don't share her opinions on food doesn't mean you can overrule her?\n\nFYI every single time I've babysat my niece and nephew I've checked with one of the parents what was ok to feed them. Every single time one of my kids has been invited to a friend's house, the parents have checked with me if there were things they shouldn't eat. At a young age it's 100% normal babysitting etiquette to check in with the parents on things like food (and screen time definitely too under the age of 3).\n\nWhy do you think because you're offering to watch the kid for a few hours you can just go ahead and undermine her?", "I'm curious, what exactly did you feed him?", "[deleted]", "Thinking you need to watch a 17 month old at all times - (especially in public!) doesn\u2019t make you a helicopter mom.  At all.  It makes you a responsible parent.\n\nThe fact that you disagree probably says a lot more about your parenting skills than hers.", "You keep reiterating the 'helicopter mom' insult, so I think you should just bug out of their business. You're not doing her any real good by offering \"favors\" and disregarding what you know full well are her concerns, while judging her so much. Just leave her alone and let her do whatever she's gonna do.\n\nMy perspective here comes from knowing an acquaintance who likes to sugar up everybody else's kids because she doesn't work outside the home and only has littles too young for school.... So she is fine with her own house being in total chaos and kids being up till 11 at night, since nobody has to be anywhere in the morning. Which is fine for her. But she thinks the rest of us are really \"uptight\" and often makes snide hints to that judgy effect... but its really just that we actually have to get our kids to school and our selves to outside jobs in the morning. \n\nThat's may not be what's going on here, but my point is that insults like \"helicopter mom\" are really your interpretation and, especially since she didn't actually ask you to babysit, it's best you just respect her own way and leave her to it. Whatever the dynamics are, she knows her own life better than you", "Or the fact that hair salons can be dangerous for a small child that is super active like you said.

But we're all just moms doing our best. We pick our battles. These are the ones she chose. And I feel so bad for her.

Every one year old I know was able to run by their first birthday.\nI think you\u2019re projecting unto your sister because you feel guilty on your parenting style and instead of looking at yourself you want to make her out as a crazy mom. \nApologize to your sister let her know you just weren\u2019t prepared for sitting two kids and don\u2019t offer to babysit again. \nAlso, ask her what she\u2019s doing to get her kids so mobile that will help repair the bridge and help you learn some tricks to teach your baby to walk.", "NTA.

Outside of the fact we don't even understand how the brain developes, just the barest of bare bones (hell we believed the brain stopped developing at the age of 25. And yet they're finding evidence of it being farther along at 35, and likely give it a few years and they will realize the brain never stops developing) and as such a control group would be impossible to get seeing each human develops differently and at different times.\n\nPoint being. It's very likely this \"study\" is just a sham. It's like the bullshit of saying kids nowadays dont have a long attention span because of modern tik tok videos having two different videos at the same time.\n\nWhile they're currently bitching about that they're doing something completely different to preoccupy themselves with something.

If there's an 11 month old kid briefly 'entertained' by pretty colors and sounds for a few hours, that's not going to damage a kid's development.\n\nNow, **substituting** TV for teaching isn't going to work out well, but a TV isn't inherently dangerous to children. It's functionally a tool at that point. Yes, tools can be misused, but it'd be a very poor claim that a tool is bad because it **can** be misused.\n\nOn top of that, the article you post has a specific section that stuck out to me: \"A toddler learns a lot more from banging pans on the floor while you cook dinner than he does from watching a screen for the same amount of time, because every now and then the two of you look at each other.\"\n\nQuite honestly, that's a load of crap. That 'toddler' didn't actually **learn** anything simply because eye contact was made. There wasn't interaction where the parent played with the child. There wasn't any guidance or goal. It was a kid banging on pans while the parent cooked dinner.\n\nUltimately, I'm not going to say that the TV is the **best** choice for a kid, but especially in the first couple years of having a kid, it's really tough to come even close to getting all the things done that need your attention. Every once in a while, same as most other 'treats' in life, it's not going to be a problem to let your kid be distracted/occupied by a screen.\n\nSo, while context **is** important, I'd like to stress that **frequency** should be discussed here more than anything else.\n\nRemember that show, Supersize Me? The dude who ate at McDonalds every day and was 'required' to say \"Yes\" if/when they asked if he'd like to Supersize the meal...

And I say this as a parent of a toddler who doesn't watch TV. The science quoted indicates that TV doesn't give proper socialization. 1 hour won't ruin a kid for life. 1 hour per day might. Also, the content matters. If they believe that video calling distant relatives is acceptable, and it is about opportunity cost, then certain content (i.e. Miss Rachel?) might much more ok than watching, say, powerpuff girls. Most of this research comes from aggregate longitudinal studies which tend to correlate high tv watching with less attention generally. But people like to boil everything down to a tweet, aka TV = bad. There is nuance here. TV is a crutch that should be avoided. But there isn't clear science that marginal usage, i.e. 1 viewing session, has any adverse effects.\n\n\\---\n\nEither way, ESH in my book.

'high quality programming' such as Sesame Street is a better choice than many cartoons that are 'geared' towards kids.\n\nI'm not saying to take something with a grain of salt.

It was no longer a useful reward because she'd mastered the responsibility of going to the bathroom appropriately for her age. So the reward was useful **during** that period.
