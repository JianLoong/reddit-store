Lady says no as she doesn't want to drive again (we live 1.5 hours apart). Lady asks me to come to her place and I decline for the same reason. we chat further before I go to sleep\n\nToday rolls around, we exchange a small amount of messages and she asks again if I would visit her this evening. I reiterated no and stopped replying for a time. At around 7 I'm sitting outside, smoking a cigarette in my Saturday afternoon best (think Lenny in please don't tell anyone how I live). \n\nLo and behold at this exact moment I get a text from Lady, telling me she's outside and asking me to come out. I freak the fuck out and dart inside and lock the door. This is more of a social anxiety thing rather than a concern for my physical wellbeing; I'm a big tall man and lady is a tiny woman\n\nI reply at this point and ask her to leave please as I had no idea she was coming. She says no and asks me to come out again. Our messages go back and forth in this vein for a minute or so. At this point I tell her that I will call the police if she doesn't leave. She calls me mean and I stop responding. I'm assuming she's gone now but I haven't checked. I had no intention of wasting police time on petty social drama but I just wanted her gone.\n\nI feel like an asshole because I did invite her to come over at this exact time yesterday, but she said no so I thought that was that. No indication was given to me that lady intended to visit. Had she given me even an hour's notice I would have happily complied. It's just that her showing up with no warning sent me immediately into flight mode like a rabbit realising it's been spotted by the guy wearing one of those hats with the ear flaps holding a rifle.\n\nLike I said, I feel like a dick because an invitation was made by me and it's a long arse drive but I had no fucking clue lady was actually planning to show. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683972241, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13gdg6n/aita_date_shows_up_at_my_house_unnanounced/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For you, it was like, it would be nice to see her, but only under certain circumstances and they weren't met, so you didn't want to see her alltogether and made a fool out of both of you. I am not a fan of himym, but this seems like a dahmer vs dobler scenario. \n\nShe miscalculated the situation, but you way overreacted in a really shitty way, so sorry, but yta. If there wasn't some kinf of established relationship, if you hadn't asked her to come by a day prior, if you opened the door and told her to go home, my verdict would be different, but in this scenario, you took a complicated dating situation and instead of handling it somewhat mature or kind you completly overreacted", "I think I've unlocked a new fear of showing up at someone's house after reading this \ud83d\ude02 I would be so completely humiliated.", "NTA.

Honestly,  my guess is she wanted to surprise you.  It would appear prior to this incident that she was very into you.

Sure, it's unusual to show up unannounced, but you had been giving clear signals that you wanted to see her again. Maybe she happened to be in the area.

You could just say, \"I said no, and I'm not going to change my mind. See you another time, I hope.\" Even if that did not stop her from arguing over text, it's not like she was banging on your door.

Revenge for what exactly? She said no to driving 99 minutes to see him so she got angry for some reason and drove the 90 minutes to take revenge for herself not wanting to drive 90 minutes...?! My brain is in shambles tryinh to make sense of your reasoning", "It\u2019s illegal to be on someone\u2019s property without permission. It\u2019s called trespassing.", "That's fair, I didn't really think of it that way. I mean if he showed up at her place unannounced at night he would no doubt be seen as a creep, so why does she get a pass? But yeah, cellphones have sort of eliminated the need for unannounced drop ins.", "No 3rd date for you.", "Ehm it wasn't about Ted Mosby or any in the group at all, the point is, how you view a situation differently depending on your own romantic interest in the person. So in this situation she saw you and her as Dobler, you saw it more as Dahmer.\n\nBut hey, you missing the point completly fits with your post, so I am not surprised", "\ud83d\ude02 live and learn! \ud83d\ude0a", "Yeah I would have said \"you said no so I made different plans\".", "And she declined, so she should not have expectations for a visit.\n\nBut yeah, I have anxiety myself, and I still say you should have talked to her.  Get pro help for your anxiety if it's really that bad and you have access to it.", "I would respond with..\n\n\"Well, I'm inviting you to fuck off now sooo....\"\n\nNo good comes from entertaining a person who is so rude...", "It\u2019s not about the threat level, especially considering she\u2019s there for what I can assume is adult time together, it\u2019s about boundaries and basic decency. I was pointing out the difference in attitudes people would have of a potentially vulnerable woman was put in this situation, it wouldn\u2019t be an AH move or immature to lock the door and hide. Is OP in physical danger? No, but not being in danger doesn\u2019t make you an AH", "He invited her and then she uninvited herself. That should've been the end of the matter. Stop playing games. Surprises like that only really work if you know the person for a significant amount of time. NTA", "The real issue is you have time to plan/prepare vs not when it\u2019s an unexpected visit", "Okay yes- but if someone says no when they're invited over the day before then I'm most likely making new plans at that point.", "Hahah I love this response. Now remember the woman is small and the guy is big. I'm curious if the person you replied too is going to make a comment or not on what you posted. Lol", "What a useless hypothetical", "Well there\u2019s a safety concern for the woman, as in general men are a lot stronger and larger than women. \n\nI agree that *usually* there is a double standard for women. But this isn\u2019t that.", "He did say no and she refused to leave.", "Apparently not if you can\u2019t even go outside for a woman.", "Naw. Going from a decline to showing up at your door\u2026that\u2019s weird. \n\n\nWhat if you made other plans?\n\nNTA", "It's good to have boundaries, but boundaries only work when communicated and may take a small amount of time to learn. Maybe after this incident, she could have begun to respect your boundary. But if you think not, it's your call.", "Nope. OP was understandably spooked because this is already super creepy, stalkerish behavior.", "\u2026 you would be okay with your one night stand, who you threatened to call the cops on, being pregnant? YTA just for that.", "Being uncomfortable does not make him an ass. How he handled it does.\n\nEdit: in case it\u2019s not clear enough, the \u201clady\u201d is also an ass for showing up to a \u201cgentleman\u201d\u2019s place unannounced.", "Mostly I just didn't want to", "Yeah, I get the panic. I\u2019d be an ass too in this situation. There\u2019s no way this wouldn\u2019t throw me off. \n\nSurprises are really better suited for people you know well enough to predict that they will have a happy reaction to the surprise. \n\nESH", "This is why I think this sub needs a JAH (justified A-hole). I have GAD and social anxiety, and I would react like OP.", "Plot twist: I don\u2019t think he really liked her\u2026. \n\nShe went to his place the 1st time.

If he liked her, the logical conclusion would have been that it\u2019s his turn to take the drive. \n \nHe wants a convenient thing to have sex with, and in my experience that doesn\u2019t usually mean they like you", "I'm going to apologise for sure. No intention of pursuing this further though", "No it's not it's still fucking creepy and weird.", "I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from but that\u2019s no where near romantic. I can\u2019t even say it\u2019s a generational thing because I\u2019m not young and I find it extremely creepy.", "Ehh, I think that\u2019s only true for romantic movies/books. In real life, it\u2019s creepy. I had a guy show up uninvited once and it was very uncomfortable. We\u2019d been on two casual dates and texted some, but him showing up uninvited when he knew I was recovering from surgery and prepping for a deadline was definitely not the romantic gesture he thought it was.", "I would consider it creepy and weird, especially if we had agreed not to meet up even if dates and times had been thrown around in texts previously. I mean OP could\u2019ve made other plans and not even been home", "Yeah I should hope not", "Great reply and reference.", "Wouldn't my interpretation of the event as creepy be equally valid then? No particular need to have a go at me though", ">but not being in danger doesn\u2019t make you an AH\n\nYeah, it kind of does. There's no reason he couldn't have just talked to her and said this isn't a good time before he went inside and locked the door.", "The real issue is acting like an adult and just saying hey sorry I got some other stuff planned rather than hiding, locking your door and threatening to call the police.", "It\u2019s literally the same situation with reversed genders.", "I can. I'm just asking for a little notice", "Exactly. What if OP wasn't around? Or even in another town? Would she just stand there waiting?", "Well, sure. But he hadn't. Instead he decided to make threats of calling the police that he admitted were a lie. ESH.", "I guess I\u2019m from a generation where people were not so dramatic. Stalking is a pattern! A PATTERN! One incident when they had previously discussed hanging out is hardly stalking. Sure, she should have called cause she only has known the dude for one date and she doesn\u2019t know that he likes receiving unannounced visitors, but holyyy stalkerish behavior. Sure Jan.", "I mean that's pretty shitty tbh. You like her enough to let her come to your place and continue to talk to her, but putting in the effort to go see her is too much \ud83d\ude44", "You do realise that this mostly means this is over whatever it is.\n\nI had a BF who mostly had me travel and I ended this pretty quickly because travel is costly and exhausting.\n\nAnd if you want any sort of togetherness however it may be then you need to contribute equally.\n\nIf you do not want that you at least owe the other person the honesty to tell them so.\n\nESH since she should have not shown up at your home without permission either.", "I refuse to believe you wouldve threatened to call the police lmao that is just outrageous behavior.", "100% & I feel like this alone makes him the AH.", "I agree with you. Clearly some folks have never had someone they've only met once show up unannounced.", "... in your opinion.", "so my boyfriend turning up to my house with flowers when im unwell but have not invited him over is considered creepy is it? wow .. what a world we live in now.", "I didn't say you were wrong to not be as interested or to not wanting to see her, just that you overreacted and handled it poorly considering the whole scenario. My go at you was because, you again didn't read the whole situation, but reacted out of something that wasn't said or done, but something only existing in your mind.", "But the genders arent reversed, and your hypothetical assumes women \\*statistically\\* dont have more to reasonably fear. He had asked her over for that same evening, it was reasonable for her to assume he wanted to see her. All he had to do was say oh sorry I have plans or nut up and say Hey this isnt going to work out but instead he chose the most immature reaction possible.", "She did, she said she was outside. That\u2019s your notice.  You went very wrong about this and so did she. You both suck.", "After she refused to leave.", "It's actually totally okay for people to want to protect themselves at the first sign of creepy behavior. People get murdered all the time when they don't take signs like this seriously.", "Yeah something like that", "I certainly hope its over", "Depends on the time of the day. The area I live in is not very safe, so if I ask someone to leave and they won't, calling the police would be an option.", "If I've only met the man once like in this exact case? Fucking creepy and weird. Someone I've been casually seeing for a while? Wouldn't bug me.", "It\u2019s creepy and weird", "I think we\u2019re meaning someone on the same level as OP\u2019s lady friend - someone you only sort of know. A guy you had a one night stand with showing up at night without warning IS creepy.\n\nA boyfriend is different and in most cases that would be very welcome.", "This is getting a little gaslighty for my taste. Have a good one though", "Lol that's not notice and you it", "I agree. And he should have set boundaries. I just don\u2019t think that threatening to call the police is the way to set this boundary. If I was him I\u2019d have gone out there and said: you told me you were not come over so I was not expecting you today. I made plans accordingly. I am sorry but we will not be able to hang out. Then I\u2019d see how they react. That\u2019s all.", "Dude really? I mean she's weird for showing up announced but your whole attitude here sucks. I think you're both better off without each other", "Why even go on a date/hook up with someone that lives that far away in the first place? It seems to be one of the reasons why you\u2019re not interested in her. Which is fine, but just seems like a waste of your time and hers if distance is an issue for you.", "Then just leave her alone and stop engaging in this, keeping her on the backburner for sex is not cool.", "In this scenario you had previously asked them to visit you that same day though and you could easily deescalate the situation by saying oh I have plans or whatever rather than hiding, locking your door and threatening to call the cops.", "Thanks, I needed this laugh today :) But seriously, gaslighting is a serious manipulation tactic present in a lot of cases of domestic violenece. Using this word to describe an online argument about literally nothing just because you don't like the feedback is a weird reaction and diminishes the reality of many people", "I don't fault OP for threatening to call the police because he was freaked out by this egregious creepy behavior. Was he overreacting and sort of cringe? Probably. But he was provoked and therefore NTA. I can't imagine this situation coming up again.", "Couldn't agree more", "Okay, I wouldn't threat to call the cops. I would lock myself in my house tho."]}
