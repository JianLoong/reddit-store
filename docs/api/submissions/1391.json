I love her and she is great but we have had a bit of trouble when it has come to what she will wear for the wedding. My wedding is of course a formal event and I want all my family to fit the description. My mother will be wearing a long black gown with gold detailing. She looks very elegant and beautiful for her age. I want the same for my mother-in-law because of course if my family looks good, I want for my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family to look equally as elegant. The problem is my mother in law refuses to wear a formal gown. She is really set on wearing a short black dress that you would wear to a club. I\u2019m trying to nicely give her some options and even have some leeway with her but she is set on wearing a party dress for the ceremony. I don\u2019t find it appropriate at all. It\u2019s going to be freezing and I firmly believe a wedding calls for a formal gown. WIBTA if I told her no she can\u2019t wear the dress?\n\n\nEdit: I really appreciate those who are commenting. It gives me some insight on the situation. And for those who are asking. Yes my mother-in-law will be participating in the ceremony. All of my guest will be wearing formal attire.

I\u2019m gonna guess MOST of these comments saying you\u2019re the A-H are people who never have been or will never be a BRIDE. I\u2019m sorry your MIL is being ridiculous. Your request isn\u2019t an insane one. Are your bridesmaids going to be in floor length dresses? I would tell her you want her to match your bridal party and your mother, especially for group pictures you will all look at forever. My MIL literally flew me to Seattle so we could have a Nordstrom styling appointment and I could approve of her dress. That\u2019s how brides should be treated. I\u2019m sorry she\u2019s being a stubborn curmudgeon. At the end of the day, you can\u2019t force her, you can only nicely suggest.

I went to a black tie wedding in NYC over the Gramercy Park hotel. The event cost like $100k - and some guests showed up wearing what I would consider a casual but nice dress (think J Crew sundress), although the request was for black tie attire. It was an absolute non issue. I think that criticizing your future MILs attire would be in extremely poor taste and not a good start to your marriage.", "Info:\nWhen you say \"club\" do you mean dance club or cocktail dress club?\n\nBecause if it's the latter then NAH, but the former is inappropriate.", "YWBTA unless you\u2019re willing to set the dress code for the entire event as \u201cblack tie formal\u201d - *formal* being the key word here, which differentiates it from regular black tie, black tie optional, white tie with tails, etc., in which case the expectation is floor-length gowns for *all* female guests and tuxedoes for all male guests.

If her boobs and butt are legit hanging out for example you could politely suggest a more modest look to fit with the setting. However I don\u2019t really think it should be that big of a deal. It would just be awkward for her. At my wedding this one cousin showed up in the shortest little almost lingerie outfit. I didn\u2019t even notice or care myself.

I thing wrong with expecting someone who will be in your wedding ceremony to follow the dress code of the event. Hopefully, if your fianc\u00e9 frames it as wanting her to feel comfortable and not feel underdressed she will be willing to wear something else. \n\nBut if she refuses, let it go.
