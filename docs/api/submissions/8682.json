I'm surprised she resisted all those years with him, she probably did it for you. She was probably afraid that your dad would manipulate you. Which he did, with all the \"i'm trying to be better for her, but she won't take mw back\", therefore laying the blame at her feet,  instead of admitting his own fault and more importantly, to not put you in the middle of their problems. Your mother deserves to be happy, to finally be with someone who loves and respects her. I have a feeling that living with your dad was much worse than you describe, which sounds bad enough as it is.

His \u2018getting better for her\u2019 was more likely to be a front and once he got comfortable he would start abusing her again.\n\nThis probably isn\u2019t what you want to hear about your father but he wasn\u2019t your mother\u2019s soulmate and never was.

It's ok that you miss your dad and it's ok that you feel emotional, but your mom wasn't really being insensitive, she's allowed to be an adult with her own emotions", "YTA your father was an abusive partner- that level of control in a relationship is abuse. Of course he was not her soulmate. She\u2019s been in a loving relationship for a long time now and it\u2019s cruel to piss on her parade.\n\n\u201cYou never considered the abusive man you were married to to be your soul mate even after the relationship was over and he was trying to reel you back in- how dare you\u201d", "YTA. though understandably that might have been hard for you to hear, your mother is under no obligation to consider a man who she was probably very unhappy with her soulmate and has every right to find that in someone else. it's finally her chance to be happy, support her.", "YTA.

Time to grow up", "YTA...and Candice is giving a accurate describtion of your behaviour.\n\nYou were white-knighting on behalf of your father, ignoring how he treated her for many years...because it wasn't a pleasent element in your preferred narrative. And you attempted to exercise social control in order to keep things the way you like them.\n\nYou are your mom's daughter too. Start acting like it, be happy for her happyness, and deal with your (understandable) emotional issues in a more sensible way (therapy, etc).\n\nYou may not like it, but your husband did the right thing. I hope you'll see that some day, because if you don't, your marriage is a trainwreck waiting to happen.\n\nBest of luck to you.", "It\u2019s okay that you love your father.  Almost everyone does.   The love a child has for their parent is something very powerful that is almost impossible to destroy.\n\nBut you have to understand that your father *hurt* your mother.  \n\nYes, he tried to change.  Yes, he was sorry.  It\u2019s okay if you sympathise with your dad.  It\u2019s okay if your heart breaks for him.\n\nBut you *also* need to try to empathise with your mom.   She tried for *fifteen years* to make it work with your dad.   How long is long enough?   Your dad had *fifteen years* to prove that she was his soulmate.   That\u2019s a very, very long trial period.  It\u2019s great that he tried to turn his life around after your mom left him, but\u2026 well, OP, you can\u2019t say she didn\u2019t give him a chance.\n\nYour mother may have been his soulmate, but he was not her soulmate.   That is a fact.   He wasn\u2019t her soulmate because it took him *fifteen years* to even think about trying to treat her nicely.   No soulmate does that.\n\nYour mother has now found her match.   That\u2019s great.  Try to see things like that.", "YTA.  I\u2019m glad you have happy, loving memories of your father, and I\u2019m sorry that you lost him so young.  Your mother had a far more complicated relationship with him, and it sounds like he was abusive towards her.  It can\u2019t have been easy for her to come out as bi, and it isn\u2019t easy to grow your family later in life.  Your mom being in love and happy with her new partner and soulmate does not diminish your father as a person or how special he was to you.  The modern family unit comes in all shapes and sizes, and it probably feels weird to you to have a half brother and now maybe a future half brother/sister even younger than your own child, but her growing her family really isn\u2019t any of your business unless she\u2019s relying on you for financial/childcare support.  You are very young to have lived through so many life changing events, so I\u2019m going to say soft YTA and recommend you consider going to counseling to work through some of the complicated emotions and grief you are feeling.", "YTA. Wake up. Your father was abusive to your mother. He was not her soul mate.", "YTA. Just because your dad felt bad about abusing your mom later on doesn\u2019t change the damage he did. You should be happy that your mother is finally happy. It sounds like she more than earned it. Shame on you.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to dictate who she considers her soulmate.

You\u2019re a grown up stop acting like your mother isn\u2019t a human being with needs and wants just like you.", "YTA. \n\nNo one has the right to tell another person how they should feel about someone. You were a child experiencing your parents relationship. Now as an adult I\u2019m sure you know what actually goes on behind the scenes and how much more deep things are than what a child sees from their perspective. Just because your dad tried to change doesn\u2019t mean your mom needs to forgive him, let alone call him her soulmate. She found someone she\u2019s happy with in a relationship where she\u2019s finally safe, let her be in love.", "YTA. A man who what you can eat, wear and see is not your soulmate. He is an abuser. Lucky your mom could get away from him and it is strange you have no anger at your father for his abuse of your mother.  No one considers a person they divorced as their soulmate. Your father ABUSED your mother.", "YTA\n\nLook I get where you're coming from since he's your dad but YTA. You acknowledged that your dad was abusive to your mom (policing who she saw, what she ate, what she wore), so you can't seriously be surprised that your mom doesn't consider him her soulmate. \n\nYou're also turning a blind eye on the way your father treated your mom and focusing on the soulmate part too much. Do you really think that someone who sees their partner as a soulmate would treat them the same way your dad did? They wouldn't.\n\nYour mom saying her ex-husband isn't her soulmate isn't a correlation between the relationship you have with your mom. As I read your post, I could feel ribbons of envy from you. I think you resent your mom from moving on and never giving your dad a second chance, and now feel like she's replacing her old family with Candice and the kids. \n\nYou should be happy that your mom finally found someone who treats her right instead of focusing on the past. And if your mom wants to have more kids, than just accept it and move on, it's her life to live. \n\nI recommend getting some grief counseling or something similar. I think the grief of losing your dad is making you see your mom's \"moving on\" through an irrational lense.", "\"\"\"My dad wasn\u2019t amazing towards my mother; he decided who she saw, what she ate and how she dressed\"\"\n\nWhy on earth would she consider this person to be her soul mate?\n\nYTA     sounds like your mom is very happy now", "This is so sad. Not the situation. Good on your mum and I wish nothing  but good for her.\n\nBut you.\n\nI lost my dad in 2021. I loved him to bits. But I never let him off the hook for the absolute hell he put my mum through. And he knew I didn't either because I'd call him out on it.\n\nI don't know whether you are clouded by grief and I'm sorry that your are x but for you to excuse your Fathers awful treatment of your mum is sad, disgusting and you are redefining their marriage. Not your place to do. Ever. No. Not even as their child. That you think your dad should be praised for barely being what every person is supposed to do, and does do, is mind boggling.\n\nYTA", "I'm going with a soft YTA, only because you are extra emotional right now. \n\nYour father, the man you saw, loved, respected etc, was your mother's abuser. Whether or not he considered her his soul mate is irrelevant, *he was her abuser.* \n\nAnd all that \"trying to make it right\" with your mother? Not likely. It's far more likely he was just telling her what he thought she wanted to hear, so he could get her under his control again when she forgives/goes back to him. As abusers do. \n\nYou need to reconcile the fact that while you loved him, and he was a great dad, he was a terrible husband. And you need to stop holding resentment for your *abused* mother, and appreciate that she has someone who truly loves her now, the way she should be loved.", "YTA", "YTA, and incredibly judgemental.\n\nAn abusive partner is not her soul mate, the person she is with and loves her for her is her soul mate, you don't get to choose who she refers to as that.

She was lucky enough to find someone who treats her well and cares about her, and you should be happy for her, rather than punishing her for not seeing the man who mistreated her as her soulmate.", "YTA your father was abusive to her and probably made her feel caged. That was not her soulmate. A soulmate is someone who makes you feel like you can fly. Let\u2019s you be you. Maybe YOU had a great relationship with your dad, but she obviously didn\u2019t. She is allowed to feel however she wants about her new relationship. She is allowed to express how she feels about her new partner. She is a grown ass woman.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your mother. First you side with her abuser, and then you piss all over her happiness as soon as she finds any. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA. You're one insensitive asshole and your mom deserves better. Just because your dad treated you well doesn't mean your mom should forget how your stupid dad treated her. I wish your partner does the same thing to you let's see how \"insensitive\" you can get.", "YTA he was a good dad to you but let you witness him treat your mother in a controlling and honestly abusive manner? And instill in you that as long as you say sowwy then people are supposed to forget what you had done? They weren't soulmates bc I'm sorry you don't hurt your soulmate especially not knowingly.\n\nShe is entitled to find her soulmate especially if it's someone who treats her well and lets her be her. Your dad wouldn't even let her freely leave her home from the way the post reads. Cond on now, you owe your mom an apology.\n\nYou're entitled to your opinion but not to hurt others bc you feel like it.", "YTA\n\nEven from your (hopefully limited, you were a child!) view, it's clear your dad was abusive. I'm glad your mother is happy and didn't let those horrible years ruin all her hopes in other people and love. \n\nYour mom seems not to have forced you to abandon your dad and frankly, she is very selfless for that (maybe she thought that after all, it was the lesser of two evils and it was better for you to still have a dad if he wasn't dangerous). She never imposed to you to forever prove your loyalty by distancing you from your dad despite this situation being WAY more painful than a simple divorce (those due to incompatible views or fading love)... at the point that you consider appropriate to talk about this man in that way to her.\n\nLeaving behind an abusive partner is hard. Sometimes, people die before being able to. But those who managed to escape from an abusive relationship could eventually find the actual love of their life, their soulmate. You should be happy that your mother wasn't forever scarred by her abuser and that she is with someone that treats her so good at the point to be considered a soulmate.", "YTA, clearly. Stop gatekeeping your mom\u2019s happiness because you have daddy issues.", "\u2018Wasn\u2019t amazing\u2019 jesus christ the bar is SO low", "YTA\n\nWhile your dad was a good father to you, he was a horrible partner to your mother. He was controlling and abusive. Of course he wasn't her soulmate. \n\nYou've put your father on a pedestal, but he was a very faulty man and took those faults out on your mother when they were together. \n\nNothing your mother said was insensitive. She left your dad 10 years ago, because of his abuse. She's allowed to move on, be happy and find her soulmate,even say it aloud. You need to take off your rose coloured glasses about your parents' relationship, it was toxic and abusive. So no, he was not her soulmate.", "YTA. how dare you even suggest she should show any kind of care towards the man that abused her? I cannot imagine showing my own mother such contempt. \n\nSpeaking of my own mother, she did refer to my stepdad as her soul mate and not my dad. And it stung a little but I accepted it because life is just like that and apparently I had more compassion and respect at 10 than you have managed as an adult.", "YTA easily. From your own biased description, your father was clearly abusive to your mother to the point he wouldn't let her go even after she left because he kept trying to get her back anyway.\n\nGood for your mom that she can fully stand on her own and not bow down to the daughter who apparently takes after her father a little too much if she thinks there should be conditions to accepting who her mother is. I'm not even sure you're feeling replaced -- which I could understand that at least... You just sound mad that she's found her person and it wasn't your abusive AH dad. What's wrong with you? \n\nAt least your husband gets it. You might need to reevaluate your childhood and see through the lens of an adult what your mother went through. You have described literal abuse like it was not a big deal because \"he tried to get better\" and force himself back into her life.", "So \u2026 you asked your mother if she thinks she\u2019s \u201ca little old\u201d for a baby.  Her reply heard by in-laws and your husband, so I assume your question was, too.  I think her response was gracious.  In saying  it\u2019s never too later with a soulmate, she honored her love for Candice and her enthusiasm about their children instead of getting offended about your insulting question.  She is probably too nice to say, \u201cWell, maybe you are too young to be a mother, not me too old.\u201d  \n\nBeing a mother doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still have your own heart and your own truth.  Her truth is that your father was not a \u201csoulmate\u201d to her.  He did not treat her well.  In fact, he was controlling and abusive.  She found the strength to leave that man.  She moved on.  Maybe he was figuring out how to be better person when he died. Your truth was that you loved him, he was a doing better, and he was a good father to you.  Your reality is that you lost a father far too young, and that hurts.  I am sorry.  Grief is not always reasonable, and I think your attitude is coming out of a place of sadness.  \n\nHowever, if you are mature enough to be a wife and mother, you know better than to say something so rude to your mother.  You likely expect your mother to be comfortable with the fact that you still loved your father, even though be treated her like shit.  Maybe in response you can get comfortable with the fact that she is happy and in love and gets to tell her own happy truth about her relationship instead of pretending the man who mistreated her and who she divorced several years before died was the love of her life. You don\u2019t deserve comments about your age as a mother (I was a mother at 20 and those comments were unwelcome), and she doesn\u2019t deserve them at her age.  \n\nYour father did you no favors making sure you knew he wanted your mother back and was improving \u2018for her.\u2019  That was itself manipulative.  You were just a kid.  He planted in your head that he was a good, changed man and your mother should give him a chance.  That she didn\u2019t may be part of the resentment you are feeling toward her.  It was inappropriate for him to give you any hope of them getting back together unless the two of them were in full agreement.", "yta and such a bad daughter for thinking your outburst is ok in the first place.", "YTA\n\nListen to what you\u2019re saying. You witnessed your father mistreat your mother for years and think after all that she should still consider the man who treated her poorly her \u2018soulmate\u2019 because he said sorry?\n\nSo basically \u2018tried to get better for her\u2019 means \u2018he treated her like garbage but did make some attempt to treat her less like garbage when it was clear she wouldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u2019 You think that\u2019s what your mother deserves from a soulmate - to be mistreated and to be grateful if he says sorry about it after she refuses to tolerate it anymore? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\n\nLook, I think growing up in that household has affected your view of relationships more than you realise. The fact you see him control every aspect of your mothers life and describe that as only \u2018not amazing\u2019 shows you are either trying to avoid the gravity of this, or have such a warped view of what happened that you\u2019ve been desensitised to it. You are making excuses for him and are struggling to connect that the father you loved was a man who bullied your mum. That\u2019s a difficult duality to come to terms with; that someone can be monstrous but also someone who treated us well.

He was controlling and abusive and I'm glad for you that you don't have to put up with that in your relationship. Control is not love. Your soulmate by definition ought not to be controlling or abusive.  You were young when they separated so it is likely that you didn't see what happened if she acted against his decisions about who she saw, what she ate, or how she dressed.\n\nAbusers often try different scripts to see if they can bring the person they abused back under their control. If he was truly trying to change and be a better man, I am happy for him. But he didn't have a time machine and he couldn't erase the past.  Your mom was right to realize he was not her soulmate, and that she didn't have to go back for your sake, or \"because he's changed\".\n\nI have an ex, who, when I left him, thought a good compromise would be for me to wait in stasis, not have any other relationships and try again in \"a few years\" when he \"got his life together\". This was the final request, after years of him slightly changing his script to see if I would stay, rather than actually changing anything about our relationship. I decided not to believe him. instead, 20 years later, he still tries to control his relatives and will punish them emotionally if they dare to spend time with me.  I moved abroad 9 years after we separated and 5 years later, his relatives (my friends) who came to see me, were too afraid to post online about their interactions with me, because they'd \"hear it from him\" when they got back. In some way, I was being punished for leaving, and (presumably) if I saw the error of my ways and came back, I'd be able to have relationships with mutual friends and family again. It's been 20 years, and his mother still only contacts me on private messages on Facebook for important events, and never responds to my messages, even though, for a short time, we had rekindled our friendship.\n\nThis is the kind of man your father was.  At least he tried to shield you from the worst of his nature.  No one can say if he REALLY changed, or if all those years later, he was still trying to get your mom to learn her lesson and come back to her \"soulmate\"\n\nI no longer believe in soulmates, I believe love is a choice. Your father chose to not love your mother but to be obsessed with her instead. Your mother chose to find someone new who loves her like she deserves.
