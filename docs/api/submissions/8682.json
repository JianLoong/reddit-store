The love a child has for their parent is something very powerful that is almost impossible to destroy.\n\nBut you have to understand that your father *hurt* your mother.  \n\nYes, he tried to change.  Yes, he was sorry.  It\u2019s okay if you sympathise with your dad.  It\u2019s okay if your heart breaks for him.\n\nBut you *also* need to try to empathise with your mom.   She tried for *fifteen years* to make it work with your dad.   How long is long enough?   Your dad had *fifteen years* to prove that she was his soulmate.   That\u2019s a very, very long trial period.  It\u2019s great that he tried to turn his life around after your mom left him, but\u2026 well, OP, you can\u2019t say she didn\u2019t give him a chance.\n\nYour mother may have been his soulmate, but he was not her soulmate.   That is a fact.   He wasn\u2019t her soulmate because it took him *fifteen years* to even think about trying to treat her nicely.   No soulmate does that.\n\nYour mother has now found her match.

Your mother had a far more complicated relationship with him, and it sounds like he was abusive towards her.  It can\u2019t have been easy for her to come out as bi, and it isn\u2019t easy to grow your family later in life.  Your mom being in love and happy with her new partner and soulmate does not diminish your father as a person or how special he was to you.  The modern family unit comes in all shapes and sizes, and it probably feels weird to you to have a half brother and now maybe a future half brother/sister even younger than your own child, but her growing her family really isn\u2019t any of your business unless she\u2019s relying on you for financial/childcare support.  You are very young to have lived through so many life changing events, so I\u2019m going to say soft YTA and recommend you consider going to counseling to work through some of the complicated emotions and grief you are feeling.", "YTA. Wake up. Your father was abusive to your mother. He was not her soul mate.", "YTA. Just because your dad felt bad about abusing your mom later on doesn\u2019t change the damage he did. You should be happy that your mother is finally happy. It sounds like she more than earned it. Shame on you.", "YTA you don\u2019t get to dictate who she considers her soulmate.

You\u2019re a grown up stop acting like your mother isn\u2019t a human being with needs and wants just like you.", "YTA. \n\nNo one has the right to tell another person how they should feel about someone. You were a child experiencing your parents relationship. Now as an adult I\u2019m sure you know what actually goes on behind the scenes and how much more deep things are than what a child sees from their perspective. Just because your dad tried to change doesn\u2019t mean your mom needs to forgive him, let alone call him her soulmate. She found someone she\u2019s happy with in a relationship where she\u2019s finally safe, let her be in love.", "YTA. A man who what you can eat, wear and see is not your soulmate. He is an abuser. Lucky your mom could get away from him and it is strange you have no anger at your father for his abuse of your mother.  No one considers a person they divorced as their soulmate. Your father ABUSED your mother.", "YTA\n\nLook I get where you're coming from since he's your dad but YTA. You acknowledged that your dad was abusive to your mom (policing who she saw, what she ate, what she wore), so you can't seriously be surprised that your mom doesn't consider him her soulmate. \n\nYou're also turning a blind eye on the way your father treated your mom and focusing on the soulmate part too much. Do you really think that someone who sees their partner as a soulmate would treat them the same way your dad did? They wouldn't.\n\nYour mom saying her ex-husband isn't her soulmate isn't a correlation between the relationship you have with your mom. As I read your post, I could feel ribbons of envy from you. I think you resent your mom from moving on and never giving your dad a second chance, and now feel like she's replacing her old family with Candice and the kids. \n\nYou should be happy that your mom finally found someone who treats her right instead of focusing on the past. And if your mom wants to have more kids, than just accept it and move on, it's her life to live. \n\nI recommend getting some grief counseling or something similar. I think the grief of losing your dad is making you see your mom's \"moving on\" through an irrational lense.", "\"\"\"My dad wasn\u2019t amazing towards my mother; he decided who she saw, what she ate and how she dressed\"\"\n\nWhy on earth would she consider this person to be her soul mate?\n\nYTA     sounds like your mom is very happy now", "This is so sad. Not the situation. Good on your mum and I wish nothing  but good for her.\n\nBut you.\n\nI lost my dad in 2021. I loved him to bits. But I never let him off the hook for the absolute hell he put my mum through. And he knew I didn't either because I'd call him out on it.\n\nI don't know whether you are clouded by grief and I'm sorry that your are x but for you to excuse your Fathers awful treatment of your mum is sad, disgusting and you are redefining their marriage. Not your place to do. Ever. No. Not even as their child. That you think your dad should be praised for barely being what every person is supposed to do, and does do, is mind boggling.\n\nYTA", "I'm going with a soft YTA, only because you are extra emotional right now. \n\nYour father, the man you saw, loved, respected etc, was your mother's abuser. Whether or not he considered her his soul mate is irrelevant, *he was her abuser.* \n\nAnd all that \"trying to make it right\" with your mother? Not likely. It's far more likely he was just telling her what he thought she wanted to hear, so he could get her under his control again when she forgives/goes back to him. As abusers do. \n\nYou need to reconcile the fact that while you loved him, and he was a great dad, he was a terrible husband. And you need to stop holding resentment for your *abused* mother, and appreciate that she has someone who truly loves her now, the way she should be loved.", "YTA", "YTA, and incredibly judgemental.\n\nAn abusive partner is not her soul mate, the person she is with and loves her for her is her soul mate, you don't get to choose who she refers to as that.

She was lucky enough to find someone who treats her well and cares about her, and you should be happy for her, rather than punishing her for not seeing the man who mistreated her as her soulmate.", "YTA your father was abusive to her and probably made her feel caged. That was not her soulmate. A soulmate is someone who makes you feel like you can fly. Let\u2019s you be you. Maybe YOU had a great relationship with your dad, but she obviously didn\u2019t. She is allowed to feel however she wants about her new relationship. She is allowed to express how she feels about her new partner. She is a grown ass woman.", "YTA. I feel sorry for your mother. First you side with her abuser, and then you piss all over her happiness as soon as she finds any. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA. You're one insensitive asshole and your mom deserves better. Just because your dad treated you well doesn't mean your mom should forget how your stupid dad treated her. I wish your partner does the same thing to you let's see how \"insensitive\" you can get.", "YTA he was a good dad to you but let you witness him treat your mother in a controlling and honestly abusive manner? And instill in you that as long as you say sowwy then people are supposed to forget what you had done? They weren't soulmates bc I'm sorry you don't hurt your soulmate especially not knowingly.\n\nShe is entitled to find her soulmate especially if it's someone who treats her well and lets her be her. Your dad wouldn't even let her freely leave her home from the way the post reads. Cond on now, you owe your mom an apology.\n\nYou're entitled to your opinion but not to hurt others bc you feel like it.", "YTA\n\nEven from your (hopefully limited, you were a child!) view, it's clear your dad was abusive. I'm glad your mother is happy and didn't let those horrible years ruin all her hopes in other people and love. \n\nYour mom seems not to have forced you to abandon your dad and frankly, she is very selfless for that (maybe she thought that after all, it was the lesser of two evils and it was better for you to still have a dad if he wasn't dangerous). She never imposed to you to forever prove your loyalty by distancing you from your dad despite this situation being WAY more painful than a simple divorce (those due to incompatible views or fading love)... at the point that you consider appropriate to talk about this man in that way to her.\n\nLeaving behind an abusive partner is hard. Sometimes, people die before being able to. But those who managed to escape from an abusive relationship could eventually find the actual love of their life, their soulmate. You should be happy that your mother wasn't forever scarred by her abuser and that she is with someone that treats her so good at the point to be considered a soulmate.", "YTA, clearly. Stop gatekeeping your mom\u2019s happiness because you have daddy issues.", "\u2018Wasn\u2019t amazing\u2019 jesus christ the bar is SO low", "YTA\n\nWhile your dad was a good father to you, he was a horrible partner to your mother. He was controlling and abusive. Of course he wasn't her soulmate. \n\nYou've put your father on a pedestal, but he was a very faulty man and took those faults out on your mother when they were together. \n\nNothing your mother said was insensitive. She left your dad 10 years ago, because of his abuse. She's allowed to move on, be happy and find her soulmate,even say it aloud. You need to take off your rose coloured glasses about your parents' relationship, it was toxic and abusive. So no, he was not her soulmate.", "YTA. how dare you even suggest she should show any kind of care towards the man that abused her? I cannot imagine showing my own mother such contempt. \n\nSpeaking of my own mother, she did refer to my stepdad as her soul mate and not my dad. And it stung a little but I accepted it because life is just like that and apparently I had more compassion and respect at 10 than you have managed as an adult.", "YTA easily. From your own biased description, your father was clearly abusive to your mother to the point he wouldn't let her go even after she left because he kept trying to get her back anyway.\n\nGood for your mom that she can fully stand on her own and not bow down to the daughter who apparently takes after her father a little too much if she thinks there should be conditions to accepting who her mother is. I'm not even sure you're feeling replaced -- which I could understand that at least... You just sound mad that she's found her person and it wasn't your abusive AH dad. What's wrong with you? \n\nAt least your husband gets it. You might need to reevaluate your childhood and see through the lens of an adult what your mother went through. You have described literal abuse like it was not a big deal because \"he tried to get better\" and force himself back into her life.", "So \u2026 you asked your mother if she thinks she\u2019s \u201ca little old\u201d for a baby.  Her reply heard by in-laws and your husband, so I assume your question was, too.  I think her response was gracious.  In saying  it\u2019s never too later with a soulmate, she honored her love for Candice and her enthusiasm about their children instead of getting offended about your insulting question.  She is probably too nice to say, \u201cWell, maybe you are too young to be a mother, not me too old.\u201d  \n\nBeing a mother doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t still have your own heart and your own truth.  Her truth is that your father was not a \u201csoulmate\u201d to her.  He did not treat her well.  In fact, he was controlling and abusive.  She found the strength to leave that man.  She moved on.  Maybe he was figuring out how to be better person when he died. Your truth was that you loved him, he was a doing better, and he was a good father to you.  Your reality is that you lost a father far too young, and that hurts.  I am sorry.  Grief is not always reasonable, and I think your attitude is coming out of a place of sadness.  \n\nHowever, if you are mature enough to be a wife and mother, you know better than to say something so rude to your mother.  You likely expect your mother to be comfortable with the fact that you still loved your father, even though be treated her like shit.  Maybe in response you can get comfortable with the fact that she is happy and in love and gets to tell her own happy truth about her relationship instead of pretending the man who mistreated her and who she divorced several years before died was the love of her life. You don\u2019t deserve comments about your age as a mother (I was a mother at 20 and those comments were unwelcome), and she doesn\u2019t deserve them at her age.  \n\nYour father did you no favors making sure you knew he wanted your mother back and was improving \u2018for her.\u2019  That was itself manipulative.  You were just a kid.  He planted in your head that he was a good, changed man and your mother should give him a chance.  That she didn\u2019t may be part of the resentment you are feeling toward her.  It was inappropriate for him to give you any hope of them getting back together unless the two of them were in full agreement.", "yta and such a bad daughter for thinking your outburst is ok in the first place.", "YTA\n\nListen to what you\u2019re saying. You witnessed your father mistreat your mother for years and think after all that she should still consider the man who treated her poorly her \u2018soulmate\u2019 because he said sorry?\n\nSo basically \u2018tried to get better for her\u2019 means \u2018he treated her like garbage but did make some attempt to treat her less like garbage when it was clear she wouldn\u2019t take it anymore.\u2019 You think that\u2019s what your mother deserves from a soulmate - to be mistreated and to be grateful if he says sorry about it after she refuses to tolerate it anymore? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying.\n\nLook, I think growing up in that household has affected your view of relationships more than you realise. The fact you see him control every aspect of your mothers life and describe that as only \u2018not amazing\u2019 shows you are either trying to avoid the gravity of this, or have such a warped view of what happened that you\u2019ve been desensitised to it. You are making excuses for him and are struggling to connect that the father you loved was a man who bullied your mum. That\u2019s a difficult duality to come to terms with; that someone can be monstrous but also someone who treated us well. I know Reddit always suggests therapy, but I think a few sessions to help you work through your feelings could help you.", "YTA.. your dad wasn\u2019t her soulmate.

Your soulmate by definition ought not to be controlling or abusive.  You were young when they separated so it is likely that you didn't see what happened if she acted against his decisions about who she saw, what she ate, or how she dressed.\n\nAbusers often try different scripts to see if they can bring the person they abused back under their control. If he was truly trying to change and be a better man, I am happy for him. But he didn't have a time machine and he couldn't erase the past.  Your mom was right to realize he was not her soulmate, and that she didn't have to go back for your sake, or \"because he's changed\".\n\nI have an ex, who, when I left him, thought a good compromise would be for me to wait in stasis, not have any other relationships and try again in \"a few years\" when he \"got his life together\". This was the final request, after years of him slightly changing his script to see if I would stay, rather than actually changing anything about our relationship. I decided not to believe him. instead, 20 years later, he still tries to control his relatives and will punish them emotionally if they dare to spend time with me.  I moved abroad 9 years after we separated and 5 years later, his relatives (my friends) who came to see me, were too afraid to post online about their interactions with me, because they'd \"hear it from him\" when they got back. In some way, I was being punished for leaving, and (presumably) if I saw the error of my ways and came back, I'd be able to have relationships with mutual friends and family again. It's been 20 years, and his mother still only contacts me on private messages on Facebook for important events, and never responds to my messages, even though, for a short time, we had rekindled our friendship.\n\nThis is the kind of man your father was.  At least he tried to shield you from the worst of his nature.

Why call your mom out for having a child so close to your child's age when you've started at such a young age? I mean, no one wins here. This was an immature argument for you to have made. \n\nMany decades years ago I went to grade school with two kids in the same class and one was the other's uncle. Your mom isn't doing anything super unusual as far as having children at this point in her life. And that fact that she's found a partner whom she loves and who loves her and they have an opportunity to create a loving family... I'm sorry, but you're completely biased in how you view your parent's relationship. You said yourself that your dad treated you far better than he ever did your mom. Your mom did what a lot of people struggle to do, and that's leave an abusive situation. Congratulations to her! It sounds like your mom saved herself and also did right by you, in that she encouraged you to be creative and explore your interests, and didn't seek to control you the way your father controlled her. I'd like to encourage you to really look at how you define and your father defined soul mate. It's not about how you feel towards someone, it's about how you treat them. Your father clearly had issues he needed some treatment to resolve. And you say he struggled to be worthy of your mom, but even this excludes your mom from the equation. Did she even want him back at that point? I'm guessing you know more about his emotional state than your mom did, and even that's dysfunctional and has put you in an unhealthy place. \n\nMaybe it isn't fair to ask you to be objective towards your parent's dysfunctional dynamics, but it's not unfair to ask you to stop taking your father's role in controlling your mother's choices. You don't need to keep defending your father. And judging your mother based on ageist and homophobic ideas is only going to drive a wedge between you. Acceptance of your mom's choices should not be conditional on how those choices make you feel about the life she shared with your dad.  Why not affirm her and be happy for her that she's found happiness after hardship? Your dad clearly wasn't a saint and even if he viewed your mom as his soul mate, he didn't treat her the way such a title deserved. And here's another radical idea: you can have more than one soul mate in a lifetime. \n\nYou could benefit from therapy to sort out your complicated feelings. It really seems to me that everything revolves around unresolved issues with your dad and the ways he set you up to continue his painful legacy in your mother's life.

Also, I hope you have begun to understand that the number of years a person stays with their abuser indicates nothing about the quality of the relationship or depth of love. Hopefully, you've begun to understand that being in one relationship (\"first love\") before another relationship doesn't have any bearing on the quality of either relationship. Hopefully you've learned that unrequited love creates no obligation for the object of that love.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is the other part of the story here, that most commenters are ignoring: the one where you feel upset about your mother creating a new family at about the same time as you are creating your own. The one where you still feel resentment towards your mother for not going back to your father after their divorce to re-establish your birth family. The one where you said your mother shouldn't have another child now that she is a grandmother.\n\nI've noticed that although you have listed your ages at various events and the length of your parents' marriage, you didn't list your mother's age, even though you are telling her she is too old to have a child. You've told us you're 21, and she was with your dad for 15 years, until you were 12. So that means she got together with your dad 24 years ago, but it doesn't tell us how old she was at that point. We don't even know if that was when they married, or simply when they started dating. We don't know if they dated in school and she fell pregnant as a teen, or if she had you in her mid-twenties or later. It seems that she had a child 2 years ago, and since you didn't mention adoption, nor did you mention concerns about physical issues she had with the pregnancy with her 2 yo, or signs of approaching menopause, I expect she gave birth without a problem. There are times, IMO, when someone is too old to birth a child. Not only from a physical standpoint from a parent reaching their body's biological cutoff, but also from a standpoint of how old the parent will be when their child reaches adulthood. Will they be working long enough and making enough money to support the child all the way through to adulthood before retiring and going onto a fixed income? Will their child have to be faced with caring for an elderly parent with deteriorating health at the time the child should be establishing themselves as a new adult, creating their own family and home? Are they able to care for the child? Rather than voice these legitimate concerns, or express any issues they have had with birthing or raising the 2 yo, you stated that she should not become a mother again because she is now a grandmother; that is, because you are now a mother. The fact that you didn't express concern for her health or the health of the child makes me think your mother is relatively young as mothers of 21 yo can be. I wonder if her marriage to your father wasn't a shotgun marriage to some degree. It would explain a reason she could have been stuck in a long marriage with a controlling man. Let's say she had you when she was the same age as you are now as a new mother. That would put her at 42. I have friends this age with 2 yo children or having their first children at this age. It's not irresponsibly old, regardless of whether she is also a grandmother. And if she is younger - as I suspect she might be - then you are being even more unreasonable.\n\nIt feels to me that you believe that now she is a grandmother, it is the only role she is allowed to have regarding new children. In your estimation, her identity with regards to her progeny is dictated by your relationship to your progeny, not by her own limitations as a person. This seems to follow your attitude that she should have tried to get back together with your father, her abuser, after the divorce. It has nothing to do with her needs, desires, or capabilities; and everything to do with what you want her to be - for you. You want her to have been madly in love with your father, her abuser. You wanted your parents to stay together. You want her to just be a grandmother now. A widowed grandmother with no love life, at that. You want her life to revolve around you. You are angered by the idea of her relationship with Candice surpassing the relationship with your father that she willingly left. I think you are terrified of the idea that her new family with her new child(ren) will eclipse the family that came before - that you will be left behind because you were the result of an abusive marriage, and potentially the result of a failed youthful mistake. But her love for you is not bound by her feelings for your father. In fact, her love for you is probably the primary reason she stayed with him for so very long. The fact that her first marriage wasn't her best love doesn't mean that she's going to stop loving her first child. You need to talk to a therapist about your fear of being replaced, about your fear that her view that this is the relationship she was always meant to have might mean she wasn't supposed to have you, and about your need to make your mother's life revolve around you. Stop trying to drive a wedge between yourself and your mother who clearly loves you. Be happy for your mother, not sad for yourself.", "YTA\n\nYour dad may have been a good father but he obviously wasn't a very good husband. Your mother has met someone new who makes her happy.

It was abuse, and almost certainly way worse than you realize.

When it's not mutual it's just fixation, disrespect of autonomy.\n\nYour mom has an ACTUAL soulmate now, because it's mutual. You're prioritizing your dead dad's one-sided fixation over your living mom's happiness, and you better get it through your head and admit wrongness and apologize to everyone there, because if I was your mother or partner or anyone else that knows you, I'd be adjusting my view of you right now to include \"thinks abusers are fine when they don't abuse her, and has a very flimsy understanding of healthy boundaries and what actual love and support is.\"", "YTA \n\nYour father abused your mom, regardless of how he treated you.\n\nIt\u2019s disgusting that you think this.

If at any point she had considered him a soulmate he killed that. He wasn\u2019t a great guy that messed up a little bit. He traumatized her over and over. The fact that you have any good feelings about him is a testament to her being a good mother and leaving you out of the adult issues they had.

We don't stick to the whole \"stay together for the kids\" as much as we did 50 years ago, or even 20.\n\nI understand the relationship YOU had with your dad was different from HER relationship with him.

If you were a shitty person and you pass before making amends, it's on you when you're remembered as the shitty person you were. My dad was an alcoholic. He was awful to my mom and awful to my brother. But he was always so kind to me. We spent alot of time together and he always included me in all his hobbies. He raised me up to be a mini him who always saw the best in him and took his side. He died when I was 18 and that's when I was finally able to see just how ugly he had been to my brother and mom. And I don't remember him as the great man and friend I knew growing up. It's unfortunate, but 12 years, many ups and downs and lots of therapy later I understand that HE was responsible for his behaviors and choices and the pain he caused.

Your mother thought she could trust you and come out as BI, she\u2019s truly happy with Candice and you want her to forgive a husband who treated her like dogshit? Hell no. YTA a massive one.

I'm sorry you're in this situation. When I imagine myself in this situation, then of course I would want my parents to be together forever and soul mates. But sadly this isn't the reality. Your dad at least realized his behavior was wrong. But your mom has every right not to take him back. It's an emotional topic, no doubt and you're allowed to feel what you feel, but so is your mom. What bugs me most ist how rude your mothers \"soul mate\" behaves toward you. You don't do this to hurt them, but because you can't express your feelings in another way.

Her father was nice to her. Unless she witnessed the heavier abuse directly, it is going to be hard to paint her father as an abuser, especially if she sees him trying to make up for his mistakes and not talking badly of her mother. \n\nBy the same token though, she IS acknowledging that her dad did abuse her mom. She should be perfectly capable of at least trying to analyze why her mom said that Candice is her soulmate. She's happy. She deserves to be. It isn't right for OP to get mad at that, despite her own view of her father. \n\nAs you said, she will most likely need some kind of therapy to get beyond that. I just hope OP gets better and can accept that her mom has found someone who treats her right and makes her happy.", "I agree with what you've said except the **soft** YTA. \n\nMy guess is she feels like her own relationship with her mother is somehow reduced by having been conceived out of a relationship with an abuser, and has some internalized anger and jealousy that her current & future siblings will be raised in a healthy, loving home by soulmates. She's being a petulant jealous child. \n\nInstead of being angry at her father for being abusive, or recognizing that human beings are complex and he can be both a good father AND an abusive controlling spouse, she's further victim blaming her mother for his failures. \n\nShe could try being happy that her mother has found someone who truly makes her happy, after abuse and biphobia stole decades of her life from her. \n\nI don't think OP will get there without a lot of therapy. She's self-centered and appears to lack empathy, and it will probably be best for OPs mother, wife, and child(ren) to go low contact with her until she can get to a healthier emotional state.", "And her husband saw that she was wrong and apologise", "Yeah, it says he apologized, not that he actually CHANGED.", "I just cut off friends who insisted my abusive ex was my soulmate and I needed to just keep waiting for him to get better and stop.
