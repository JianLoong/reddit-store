We got along really well when it was just us together but I was never really invited to hang out with her and her friends, which I was okay with.

He said it didn't feel \"right\" to have an innocent 10yo around a bunch of 12yo boys because they'd \"eat him alive.\"\n\nI said that was bullshit and he needs to text Julius right now and ask if he'd like to join this weekend slumber party because he'll be crushed if he finds out that he was left out. He said no.\n\nSo I ended up calling our mom who lives with my brother and explained the situation. That caused a lot of drama between her and my brother and my SIL.

Do you want your son to start stamping his feet and making demands of those around him because that is the behaviour you are modelling for him?\n2.) It does not matter whether the boys are close or if your son is friends with Parker's friends. Parker is allowed to have friendships that do not involve your son and spend time with his friends without your son present. \n3.) Your brother does not have to include your son at all times. It is his house and his rules. You decided your brother should look after your son for 3 days. You did not ask, you demanded, and then you went running to mommy when you didn't get your way. Again, bratty behaviour.\n4.) No, your mother didn't need to know. You went to her because you wanted back up. \n5.) Your behaviour will destroy relationships. Parker will resent your son if he is forced to spend time with him constantly and include him in everything, and he will resent you for forcing the issue. Your son will resent you for forcing him or Parker for not including him always. Your brother is already angry with you and will resent you for forcing your son on Parker and for you running to your mommy to tattle and causing issues in his home. And your mother and brother's relationship will suffer because you're pitting them against each other so that you can get what you want. \n\nSo, if you want to destroy your family's bonds and cause no end of resentment, keep it up.

You think that because your mother lives with your brother (or the other way around) that this means you can drop your kid there anytime you want for free childcare and it\u2019s cool. And also obligate the cousin to entertain your kid whether he wants to or not. You\u2019re also still acting like you\u2019re a child and dragging your mother into disputes with your brother which is concerning.

It doesn't seem like 500 comments saying exactly that are going to convince you, though, which kind of makes me wonder why you asked.\n\nIf your son were asked to hang out with 7/8 year old, he probably wouldn't want to, sometimes, either.    My child is in 4th and has opposite gender cousin their age.  They hang out a lot and love being together; they're more like brother and sister than cousins.  They also do things separately because they are opposite sex and that leads to different interests.\n\nI teach 5th grade.  I've taught everything from 3-8th.  There is a HUGE difference mentally just from the beginning of fifth grade to the end of it.  4th / 6th is an enormous difference when puberty hits.

The 12 year old probably has pit hair and thinks about girls, used the F-bomb regularly, and is way less interested in Roblox than Fortnite.\n\nTake the verdict as YTA.  Trying to explain your way out of it isn't really helping your case.  Apologize to your brother, take your kid to the aquarium while he still wants to go places with you, and accept that there will be a span of about eight years when the boys might not be as close as they used to be.

They're children who are at vastly different mental stages. Your son and nephew may do things together all the time, and they may get along most of the time, but that doesn't mean that your son is at his level mentally even if he seems to blend in well most of the time.

Alrhough i can u derstand in families you want the kids to spend time together and get on, and there may be limited occassions when they can get together etc. But What I would suggest in future, as there's quite an age difference in the cousins is maybe have a chat with the older cousins, and a chat with your daughter. With the older cousins you could explain to them that your daughter is only young, she looks up to them and likes to do what they're doing and join in etc, but you understand that because she's little they may not want to spend the whole time playing things that have to be suitable for her age. Maybe ask if they would be willing to play with her for a little while, and then youll make sure to take her away and do something with her to allow them to play as older kids etc. That way you're acknowledging they don't have to play with her if they don't want to, you understand she's younger and means they can't play stuff of their age around her, and you don't want to stop the older cousins bonding and playing, but you'd like it if they could include your daughter for a little while as she looks up to them and wants to be with them, and she feels a bit left out etc, but you'll make sure to take her away after say half an hour/ 40 mins to do something else and let them do older girls stuff. \n\nAnd maybe try to explain to your daughter (in age appropriate language), that as they are older, she can't always join in with things they do as it may be dangerous for her, so they can play with her for a little while, but then it's important to let them play as older children too. And that as she gets older she'll be able to do more things too. \n\nThen make sure you have a plan of how to entertain your daughter with something fun when it's time to remove her from the older kids. And whatever you do, make sure you stick to that agreement and do remove her, and don't let her guilt trip you into letting her play with them longer, or if you're busy she goes to join them and interfere in what they're doing, coz otherwise that will show the older kids you won't stick to your word, so they'll be less likely to want to play with her for a short period next time knowing they won't get free time after anyway. And your daughter will learn if she plays up enough you'll give in and let her play with them for longer. So just make sure you stick to your promises etc and have something fun for your daughter to do after. \n\nObviously depending on how long you're together, if it's just a couple of hours or a whole day, you may want to do a couple of short periods of all of them playing, so they play with her for half hour, then go off on their own for a while, then after lunch maybe do another half hour with your daughter etc. Its all relevent to the time your together. That way you're respecting the older kids wanting to do older kids stuff, and not forcing them to be with a toddler, but you're also showing them it's nice to include her so she doesn't feel let out completely etc, and you're showing you're daughter about respecting boundaries etc. \n\nHope that all makes sense lol I tend to waffle.", "It is hurtful when someone you're close to leaves you out and my heart goes out to your little girl.
