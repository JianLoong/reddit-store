As much as I hate to be like those meme stereotypes everyone posts about people who study abroad... it really IS a lifechanging experience. I'm really trying to temper my excitement because I know honeymoon periods are real when it comes to living in a new place, but I genuinely think the city I'm in now is where I'd like to spend my life. I've met so many incredible people and had experiences I'll never forget.\n\nI was supposed to fly home for Christmas and have had a plane ticket booked for months now. Even if I hadn't, I would have plenty of money to pay for it. On top of the allowance I've been getting from my parents, I've been all but adopted by a family nearby where I'm staying. I found the person I consider my platonic soulmate here and I've been working for his father when I have the time - so I also make extra money from that - and staying at their place instead of the tiny school provided accommodations. They invited me to stay with them for Christmas, and it started looking more and more appealing. Experiencing the holidays there, especially New Years and my friend's upcoming end-of-December birthday was incredibly hard to turn down.\n\nSo, I told my girlfriend that the country turned out to be more expensive than I thought, my previous flight got cancelled without warning and I got fucked over by the airline, so I won't be able to make it home. I broke this news to her a few weeks ago and she's been trying to come up with solutions ever since. I feel bad about lying, but I feel like the alternative would be breaking her heart by telling her that I'm not coming home by choice.\n\nLast night, she called me and told me that she had started working extra shifts and had made enough money to fly me in herself. Obviously I felt terrible, but I politely turned it down by saying I already made other plans after my original flight was 'cancelled.'\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670306544, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zdxftf/aita_for_lying_about_my_financial_situation_to/", "score": 181, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've got chosen family abroad which is awesome.\n\nnot an excuse to abandon your partner. and definitely not an excuse to lie about it.\n\nedit: i used the word \"abandon\" specifically to show that she's EXPECTING you. it's your fault for not making expectations clear. if you didn't wasn't to come home, that's not ABANDONMENT as long as you make that clear. which you did not.", "You\u2019re not the asshole for wanting to stay there for the holiday - YTA for lying to your girlfriend about it.", "YTA\n\nYou should have told her the truth at the start. Now you are playing with people feelings and well-being - she is busting her ass to help you and it's for nothing.", "YTA, for lying and not sharing what sounds like major life changes with your girlfriend. How are you gonna spend your life there if you can\u2019t even tell the people you care about that you want to stay there for a holiday?", "Don't know how you're 23 and unable to use your words to communicate with your girlfriend. Do you think lying isn't going to hurt her? I'm genuinely curious. \n\nYTA obviously.", "YTA and a coward. If this is how you treat your partner you should know it won't last. I think you're too cowardly to break up with her.  She should dump you as soon as you tell her. \n\nIf really you cared for her you would use the extra money you have to pay her way to see you for the holidays!", "YTA. I would come clean now or it\u2019s going to be that much worse when she finds out and she\u2019ll think you\u2019re cheating as well.

Just be upfront and tell her you don't want to see her or be with her. Stop wasting her time.", "YTA for lying to your gf. Not the AH for wanting to stay.\n\nPossible solution: pay for a ticket for her to come join you, if the family you are staying with would be okay accommodating her as well.\n\nBut also\u2026. Honesty is the best policy, even if it sucks for both parties involved.", "So you're cheating on your girlfriend with a guy and vice versa and haven't told either of them that you're stringing both along because you like to have cake and eat it too. You're just the worst of the worst, seriously. You've basically set up an ideal situation for you where you have a foot out the door in both relationships and can bail if one of them falls apart. You're such a jerk to everyone and I hope people catch on and abandon you. You don't deserve that guy and his family nor do you deserve that amazingly kind girlfriend. YTA to the fullest.", "Clearly YTA for lying about the whole Christmas situation. \n\nBut moreso, it's sounds like you've mentally already got one foot out the door of your whole life situation that existed before your placement abroad. Your GF clearly has alot emotionally invested into the relationship if she's working extra to pay for you to fly home. If this is a long-standing, serious relationship, and she has expectations about it progressing to marriage eventually, you absolutely owe this woman an honest talk about the whole situation. Don't string her along and waste her time on a relationship that you're not committed to.", "YTA for lying to your girlfriend. Whether it hurts her feelings or not, you're abusing her trust in you, and that's far worse than the truth.", "YTA big time. You\u2019re 23 not 16 where you can\u2019t disclose your true feelings. \nOn top of it, you\u2019re cheating on her, time to be a grown up and accept what you\u2019ve done. \n\nPlease stop leading her on. She\u2019s clearly sulking. This is cruel and manipulative. \nYou will break her heart for sure, but it\u2019s better to break her heart once for all than breaking it every day.", "YTA - not for wanting to stay there but for lying to your girlfriend. She\u2019s going out of her way to try and help you out, and it\u2019s all a scam.\n\nTime to grow up and be honest. End things with her cause you don\u2019t deserve it and live your new life without the lies.", "Yta it seems you are stringing her along when you know you dont want this relationship to continue, instead of telling her so you are making up lies and have her double her efforts to save something that is already dead.\n\nJust rip the band-aid off", "YTA for lying. You say you lied to spare her feelings, but the truth will come out eventually, and it will be worse when it does. Honesty is pretty much always the best policy.", "Yta. \n\nYour girlfriend sounds sweet, caring and invested into your relationship. It's time to own up that you lied before she works herself to the bone trying to generate solutions, going to your parents, or even taking it onto herself to fly there with all that extra shift money. \n\nThe truth is going to come out soon. No airline cancels a flight unexpectedly weeks in advance. Airlines like to overbook, they might have mechanical issues, pilot shortages but your story just doesn't pass the sniff test.\n\nA girlfriend is someone you should confide in, not deceive. It sounds like you're emotionally invested in someone else and even not thinking of returning. Maybe consider how you feel about staying in your relationship. Otherwise,  be best to leave so you can settle over there and she can find someone who respects and cares for her.", "So...  Sounds like you're doing great, and I am happy for you, really.  Now, buck up, man up, grow up (however you want to word it) and communicate with the girlfriend.  She deserves the truth.

If you feel the need to lie to someone about what you\u2019re doing, then you know what you\u2019re doing is hurtful at the very least. Don\u2019t be in a relationship with someone who you are ok with lying to. Even if there is nothing more to the lie, if your partner finds out, it will ruin the trust. You need to come clean immediately", "YTA\n\nWow. Don't be surprised if the breaks it off soon. This isn't a simple white lie. This is a \"oh, GF, I respect you so little that I'm far away from you and I'll miss the one occasion I had to see you because THIS. SEEMS. SO. FANCY. \n\nYou didn't lie to spare your partner's feelings. You lied because you can't assume responsibility for your choices and actions, so you thought it would be easier to lie to her and when she busted her arse to make you fly anyway you told her you made other plans... and that's to \"spare her feelings\" ? Lol. I don't believe you one bit.\n\nYou need to grow up. Fast. Tell GF the truth and let her deal with it. If she breaks up, then it'll be on you because you were selfish, that's all.", "YTA.\n\nI studied abroad while having a distance relationship. And there is no justification for what you are doing to her, this is plain cruel.\n\nTell her. You are lying to keep two foot in on shoe. She needs to be able to do her choice based on the truth.\n\nYou are not afraid to hurt her, you are afraid that she would decide not to wait for you. You are having fun making her believe you are miserable and forcing her to be miserable.", "Yeah absolutely TA! You could have chosen to be honest with her about why you wanted to stay, you could have offered to fly her out even but now she's been doing extra work because she loves you and you're deceiving her. And now she's going to think you're TA because she did all that work and you still turned it down. She deserves so much better.", "YTA\n\nJust end your relationship with your girlfriend, when you don't want to spend Christmas and New Years with her and lie about why. She deserves someone who actually wants to spend these times with her.", "YTA for lying.  Far better for her if you had only told her the truth, because now she has wasted a lot of time and energy trying to get you somewhere you don\u2019t want to be.", "YTA.  My partner was stationed overseas.  I was so damn excited for him to come home, I had waited all this time.  He came home to break up with me.  I went into shock, I was not expecting it at all.  Just break up with her now, save her the heartache.  It's so much worse if you wait.  \n\nI have very little trust in people now.  Do you actually want to see me or are you coming to break bad news?  Do you actually love me or are you just waiting to say you don't in person?  It's a mind fuck.  Just break up with her now, truly it is better for her.", "YTA\nWhy would you lie about this to someone you supposedly care about?", "YTA  \nGrow up and be honest with her. Stop saying it's all because you don't want to hurt her, you also don't want to have this conversation and deal with what sounds like the demise of this relationship.", "YTA tell her the truth and stop lying to protect yourself. You need to own up to the choices you make and deal with the consequences of them instead of trying to weasel out of them to look innocent. You didn\u2019t want to disappoint her that you weren\u2019t coming home so you made a big elaborate story and lied about why you weren\u2019t coming instead of just telling her the truth\u2026 of course YTA, you flat out lied to her.", "When you lie, your are not only trying to take the easy way out, but also giving your girlfriend false impressions of your circumstances. YTA for making her work extra shifts.", "YTA for lying, but you really should break up with your gf instead of leading her on like this. It's ok to do that, your life has changed. Relationships end and this one is clearly over.", "YTA. She deserves to know you'd prefer not to spend the holidays with her and that you'd rather spend it with your \"adopted family\". She deserves to know what type of person she is really with. Especially when she seems to love you so much and worked her butt off with shifts trying to get you back home. You're not being fair to her. Please tell her the truth so she can decide if you're the type of person she wants to be with.", "YTA. Lying in a relationship is never ok", "YTA\n\n\nStop lying to your gf, of course you're the AH. \n\n\nDo the right thing and break up with her. You're stringing her along, being a huge AH right now. Stop it.", "Tell her. Or you\u2019ll be surprised by a ticket or her turning up to keep you company and then realising you aren\u2019t lonely and missing her very much.", "Yta. Why are you wasting her time? If you can't even be honest with her about why you don't want to come home for Christmas what are you actually getting out of the relationship?", "YTA please leave your girlfriend you're only going to end up hurting her \n\nDo what you want but having people wait for you is so low", "YTA and a coward, to be so happy at wasting another person time and emotions like you have is not a good character trait at all. \n\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend if you have any respect for her at all. It is the least you can do. She deserves to find her own true soulmate. \n\nP.s infact i hope your girlfriend sees this and dumps your cowardly behind.", "YTA. You\u2019ll always be for lying to your partner. Grow up and be honest, the only feelings you\u2019re trying to spare are yours.", "Try using a little self honesty here,  too.  It will serve you well in the future. \n\nYou didn't lie to spare her feelings.   You lied so that she wouldn't be upset with you.   You did that to spare yourself,  not her.   If you get in the habit of telling lies to spare yourself the unpleasantness of other people's reactions to your decisions,  that will not make for a very admirable adult life, or long lasting relationships.", "Moving anywhere new is a life changing experience, tbh.", "YTA obviously. Communicate instead of lying", "YTA, if you don't want to go home then just fess up. You're being a shitty bf and your gf definitely deserves better and most of all NEEDS TO KNOW THE TRUTH. She's even busting her a$$ off to try and fly down to see you!", "YTA. Grow up and use your words.", "YTA. You didn't lie to \"spare her feelings\"; you lied to spare *yourself* the awkwardness of telling your girlfriend you don't want to fly home to spend Christmas with her.\n\nBut now you've dug yourself a deeper hole, because now you've not only got to tell her that you don't want to fly home to spend Christmas with her, but you also have to tell her that you lied about it.", "YTA.

No reason to lie.", "she worked extra shifts to fly you home \ud83e\udd7a that's so sweet, shows how much she cares and wants to spend her time with you and make happy memories . And you lied and chose your platonic soul mate because they are obviously more important than her.

You didn't want to spare her a broken heart, you only thought of protecting yourself.  \nAnd now look what's happened?
