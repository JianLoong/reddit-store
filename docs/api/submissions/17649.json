Her mind changed multiple times on the bridesmaid dresses so they weren\u2019t ordered until last minute, and mine just arrived.

It is big in the wrong places and small in others, my nipples are out and I cannot properly breathe in it with where it hugs at the rib cage. I offered to have someone alter it enough for me to wear it through the ceremony and photos, but would like the option to change after for dinner and dancing in to something more comfortable that still fits the vibe of the other girls. My sister angrily says my only options are to - pay for extensive alterations and wear the dress all night, or, opt out of the wedding party, (as she is planning to change in to something more comfortable for dinner as well and does not want to be \u201ccopied\u201d). \n\nI am currently her MOH so this was very hurtful that she would not also consider my feelings, but I understand it is her day. So, AITA for wanting to change in to something more breathable so I can enjoy the night as well?\n\n(Edit) Side note: she has a history of questionable decisions with this wedding such as inviting my abusive ex so tensions are high already.

Bow out of her wedding party. Weddings are not an excuse to act like a donkey. She is being unnecessarily cruel and needs to see the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nJust because it is her day doesn't mean that you have to be uncomfortable all night, and ordering your MOH dress last minute without time to try it on and make any necessary adjustments in a timely fashion is kinda on her. I understand that she wants to have a certain aesthetic in the pictures from the ceremony, but requiring you to continue wearing an uncomfortable dress at the party is excessive.\n\nThat being said, it is still her wedding, so you shouldn't make a scene by changing the dress without having it talked through with her. If she doesn't budge and only gives you the option of either wearing the uncomfortable dress or skipping the party, it's best if you choose one of those. Not going to the party in this case would not make you AH if you don't think you can handle it. Going and making a scene would make you the AH.", "NTA.\nShe's a control freak.", "NTA\n\nI know that our culture has a long and proud tradition of _ugly_ bridesmaids dresses. But ones that leave the MoH poking out and unable to breathe is completely different. Especially since this is so close to the wedding that she sprung this on you.\n\nAt the very least, she should be offering to either let you wear what the other bridesmaids are wearing, or to pay for the alterations herself.", "Info: can you exchange the dress for a larger size so that it fits you wherever it\u2019s tight now? Paying for alterations to take a dress down sizes is cheaper & quicker, although you\u2019re going to have problems getting any alterations completed in 2 weeks.", "NTA for wanting to be comfortable, and with respect to it being her wedding day, you do realize you have choices here right?\n\nShe gave you the option of either paying for alterations or opting out of the wedding party. \n\nIf you cannot afford the alterations just attend as a guest, I'm sure it would be less stressful for you. \n\nAlso not to disrespect your sister but she sounds like a nightmare. The fact that she would invite your abusive ex alone (provided that she knows about the abuse) would have me reconsidering attending at all if I were in your shoes.", "Info \u2014 have you gone in for a fitting yet? That needs to happen ASAP. This dress may not be able to be altered enough for you to wear.\n\neta \u2014 to answer your question. As an event planner I have a personal pet peeve of people being forced to wear ill-fitting or uncomfortable clothes during an event. It creates a distraction & imo it changes the \u201cfeeling\u201d of the event. Everyone should feel comfortable in what they are wearing at an event. For the entire event. There\u2019s a reason why women are often dancing without shoes by the end of the evening. \n\nYou offered to have it altered so you should do that. If the dress is not able to be altered or you still do not feel comfortable in it... then step aside. The option of changing is not an option & it appears your sister is not interested in helping you resolve this issue.\n\nNTA", "\"Okay, I'll just attend as a guest. Would you prefer I try to match the vibe of your bridesmaids or would you rather I wear something distinctly different so it's clear that I'm not a bridesmaid?\"\n\nNTA. The only reason to be a MOH (or a bridesmaid at all) is if you are close to the bride and are someone who can provide her support on her special day. If she doesn't care enough about your well-being to *want* you to be comfortable, you don't *have* that kind of relationship with her and you can't possibly provide the kind of support required of the MOH position. Better to bow out and let her have the women she is *actually* close to be the ones who are around her on her wedding day", "NTA and I would almost lean towards N A H, but I'll get to that.\n\nFirst of all, if cloths are to tight AND to wide, go with a size up that is to wide in some places and fits good in others. Going down a size is easier (and cheaper) than going up.\n\nHaving said that, if alterations are to be made, can it not be altered enough to be comfortable for one night? If you can't properly breath, I'd say feel free, but given that alterations can still be made, why not make it possible to breath in there.\n\nAnd in regards to the \"almost N A H\"...\n\n>as inviting my abusive ex\n\nShe WHAT?! Is your ex a friend of hers? How did that happen?", "Info: have you had it assessed for alterations yet? Can you take her with you for this? The prospects don\u2019t sound good.  That may make the decision.", "NTA -- do the ceremony, do the photos, do the big exciting entrance, do it all in your dress. \n\nThen remind your sister that in 20 years, she can have all the photos with you all coordinated... or she can have pictures without you and be constantly reminded of that stupid dress.", "NTA.\n\nWouldn\u2019t it be more distracting to everyone if your nipples are poking out during the wedding and/or faint as you can\u2019t breathe?", ">My sister angrily says my only options are to - pay for extensive alterations and wear the dress all night, or, opt out of the wedding party,\n\nSend her a nice card with your regrets.
