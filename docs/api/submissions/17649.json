I understand that she wants to have a certain aesthetic in the pictures from the ceremony, but requiring you to continue wearing an uncomfortable dress at the party is excessive.\n\nThat being said, it is still her wedding, so you shouldn't make a scene by changing the dress without having it talked through with her. If she doesn't budge and only gives you the option of either wearing the uncomfortable dress or skipping the party, it's best if you choose one of those. Not going to the party in this case would not make you AH if you don't think you can handle it. Going and making a scene would make you the AH.", "NTA.\nShe's a control freak.", "NTA\n\nI know that our culture has a long and proud tradition of _ugly_ bridesmaids dresses. But ones that leave the MoH poking out and unable to breathe is completely different.

That needs to happen ASAP. This dress may not be able to be altered enough for you to wear.\n\neta \u2014 to answer your question. As an event planner I have a personal pet peeve of people being forced to wear ill-fitting or uncomfortable clothes during an event. It creates a distraction & imo it changes the \u201cfeeling\u201d of the event. Everyone should feel comfortable in what they are wearing at an event. For the entire event. There\u2019s a reason why women are often dancing without shoes by the end of the evening. \n\nYou offered to have it altered so you should do that.

Would you prefer I try to match the vibe of your bridesmaids or would you rather I wear something distinctly different so it's clear that I'm not a bridesmaid?\"\n\nNTA. The only reason to be a MOH (or a bridesmaid at all) is if you are close to the bride and are someone who can provide her support on her special day. If she doesn't care enough about your well-being to *want* you to be comfortable, you don't *have* that kind of relationship with her and you can't possibly provide the kind of support required of the MOH position.

Going down a size is easier (and cheaper) than going up.\n\nHaving said that, if alterations are to be made, can it not be altered enough to be comfortable for one night?

Like, physically it can be done, but realistically it's going to cost much more than the dress itself did and it still might not fit well if there's not time for multiple fittings. Bridesmaid dresses usually don't have much more than 1/2\" seam allowance, so without having extra fabric, you can only let them out a tiny little bit", "Funny thing is my mom ordered a dress from Amazon for me, similar to the other bridesmaids but slightly off in color, and sis was NOT happy about that. That\u2019s the dress I was hoping to compromise with.", "Thank you. He reached out to check he was *actually* invited and I informed him (and her) I would not be there if he was coming. So I\u2019m told he will not be there at least.", "Long term relationship through college. I told her about the abuse after ending the relationship and a little here and there was known. But she still invited him yes because he was part of our friend group from that time.", "She last minute invited him. He\u2019s not coming because I told him not to. My alteration is in a couple days. I don\u2019t want to be MOH for many other reasons but felt I had to. (Boundary issues)", "Haha I agree", "Internal sequins haha", "I agree thanks", "Had this thought too\u2026 but my entire family will be there.", "At least opt out of the wedding party then. She gave you that out.", "Exactly - I would let the seamstress tell her she\u2019s out of her mind.", "Can you try it on in front of your mom or dad and let them object to it?", "My mom saw it on me and totally agrees.. even ordered me a knockoff of the other bridesmaids that fits great! But not good enough for the bride", "NTA.  Your sister does not have your comfort or best interests at heart. She's given you an out- drop out now, which will make her have to explain a bit.   So you could do this.\n\nThe other thing you could do is look for a similar dress on something like poshmark or another resale site, and see if you can get something pretty close, in the right color,  that fits.   You could change into that without asking permission. If she wants to throw a fit at the reception, she can,  but  many people wouldn't notice if it was close enough.", "At this point, there's no time to really get the dress altered (remade), So, I would tend to be, \"Sis, I love you, but I cannot wear that dress for 6-8 hours straight, so I am taking your advice and will be attending as a guest. Feel free to promote some other bridesmaid to MOH.\" \n\nIf you haven't yet, as bride's sis, you'd still be expected to do the bachelorette or hens do, as a rule, if the bride doesn't melt down.", "NTA I had to change my bridemaids' dresses 2 weeks before my wedding as the shop went bankrupt. My 2 sisters were bridemaids. As I didn't like the dresses, I gave them permission to change once photos had been done. I had 2 younger bridemaids would both loved the dresses especially the youngest one who still remembers the dress after over 34 years !!", "So\u2026you have no options. No hope for exchange. No time for alterations. If your nipples are out, you can\u2019t wear it to the ceremony. How was the ordered size so far off? I guess you\u2019re not in the wedding.", "Better to skip the wedding then. If she gives you grief, you can always record her voice or her messages for some hilarious tiktok video or something.  May as well use her words to your own advantage.", "Oh no! What was her issue with it?", "People who abuse my friends and family are dead to me. Sorry you're going through this!", "I am glad you Ex is not coming.  But it shows enormous disregard for you to invite him.\n\nTake a second set of clothes if the dress can be made tome comfortable.", "seriously, underwire, uncomfortable tags, tight and ill fitting, make sure it\u2019s every bit as uncomfortable as your dress and then some", "[removed]", "NTA. We let our wedding party pick out what they wanted within parameters, but someone still ripped their too tight pants before they even got to the venue. Right down the ass seam. Luckily someone fixed it quickly, but maybe ask your sister if any of the guests are seamstresses in case you have a wardrobe malfunction, and if it'd be more embarrassing to have the MOH slip a nip or just wear a different dress, that she approves of, for the hours that no one cares.", "[removed]", "The best thing for you to do is book a ticket out of town two days before the wedding.  Tell your sister you are having nightmares due to your ex being invited and start shaking uncontrollably every time you think about it so you need to get far away.  Then go.  NTA", "Yea. OP is definitely NTA but I\u2019m so confused on the size chosen.
