Thus, we chose to buy a house that had an outdoor pool and hot tub, as we knew how much we would love it, along with our kids Hannah (F23) and Ben (M18). In the three years since we moved into our house, we've hosted some great pool parties for family, friends, and both on different occasions.\n\nWe live in California, so a few weeks ago over Ben's winter break, we were able to host a pool party to allow him and his guy and girl friends to celebrate their upcoming last semester of high school. It was a good time, and Greg and I even chilled at the party for a bit too, while Hannah was out that day with friends. It's important to mention now that both Greg and I had also been in our bathing suits. Well, just yesterday, Ben politely asked if in the future, I could stop wearing bikinis at our pool parties in front of his friends. I was flabbergasted and asked why, and Ben reluctantly explained that he had caught some of his guy friends staring at points at the last pool party, and when he confronted them about it, they didn't deny it. Ben's friends said they'd stop in the future, but Ben still wasn't super comfortable about it. He said it was weird for his mom to be objectified like that by his friends, and asked if I could stop.\n\nI rolled my eyes and told Ben that his friends were being immature teenagers, but I would decide to take their word for it that they'd really stop if they're decent young men. Ben wasn't having it and got a little upset, and Greg came in after overhearing a good chunk of it. Greg agreed with Ben and said I should stop unless I want to be inappropriate around the teens. Frustrated, I told Greg and Ben to stop \"mansplaining\" to me and that nothing about swimsuits are inherently inappropriate, and that Greg was a hypocrite given he was in his trunks in front of Ben's friends. Greg told me I was being short-minded, and annoyed, I stormed out of the house and took a drive for a few hours. I got home half an hour ago and the house is silent and awkward.

Thus, we chose to buy a house that had an outdoor pool and hot tub, as we knew how much we would love it, along with our kids Hannah (F23) and Ben (M18). In the three years since we moved into our house, we've hosted some great pool parties for family, friends, and both on different occasions.\n\nWe live in California, so a few weeks ago over Ben's winter break, we were able to host a pool party to allow him and his guy and girl friends to celebrate their upcoming last semester of high school. It was a good time, and Greg and I even chilled at the party for a bit too, while Hannah was out that day with friends. It's important to mention now that both Greg and I had also been in our bathing suits. Well, just yesterday, Ben politely asked if in the future, I could stop wearing bikinis at our pool parties in front of his friends. I was flabbergasted and asked why, and Ben reluctantly explained that he had caught some of his guy friends staring at points at the last pool party, and when he confronted them about it, they didn't deny it. Ben's friends said they'd stop in the future, but Ben still wasn't super comfortable about it. He said it was weird for his mom to be objectified like that by his friends, and asked if I could stop.\n\nI rolled my eyes and told Ben that his friends were being immature teenagers, but I would decide to take their word for it that they'd really stop if they're decent young men. Ben wasn't having it and got a little upset, and Greg came in after overhearing a good chunk of it. Greg agreed with Ben and said I should stop unless I want to be inappropriate around the teens. Frustrated, I told Greg and Ben to stop \"mansplaining\" to me and that nothing about swimsuits are inherently inappropriate, and that Greg was a hypocrite given he was in his trunks in front of Ben's friends. Greg told me I was being short-minded, and annoyed, I stormed out of the house and took a drive for a few hours. I got home half an hour ago and the house is silent and awkward.

I completely understand where this kid is coming from though.", "We aren't and my answer wouldn't have been the same if it was some joe schmoe. It's her son and presumably she cares about his feelings and his ask was not unreasonable. In fact, most ppl remember what it's like to be embarrassed by your parents or to be grossed out when ppl find your parents attractive.", "Plus \u201cwe\u2019re so rich that we have a pool at our home in CA, thanks to my husband, the doctor\u201d", "Who said \"unsupervised\"? I said \"stay out of the way.\"\n\nParents can be in the house, checking on the party periodically after saying hi to the guests, and so on. There's no need for them to be in their bathing suits out there socializing like they're in high school.", "Eighteen-year-olds aren't children.", "The problem is many teenage boys are like this so his other friends are going to be like that too", "They didn't objecify her just because they thought she looked attractive in a swimsuit. It's not like they were making rude comments.\n\nThe problem here actually comes down to kids don't really like to think of their parents as being hot or sexual in an way. Both of my parents wee attractive. It actually started for me when my dad brought me flowers before my play and as soon as he left the older girls were like your dad is so hot. I was so mad about it. Then some of my guy friends started doing the same thing in college about my mom. I think I had an easier time when it came to my mom because I was older and I was in college to be a sex therapist and we actually addressed these issues.\n\nPeople have eyes in their head and they are allowed to notice when someone is attractive.  They are younger and obviously they haven't perfected the looking without looking move but they didn't do anything wrong. If the had actually started making inappropriate remarks then they would have crossed a line. \n\nNobody but the dad is an ahole here.", "I'm making a different guess here. He's embarrassed by her bathing suit in front of his friends and instead of just telling her that,  he passed it off on his friends. If I were his mom, I'd buy a supper cute cover up and use it when his friends are there. I know that won't be a popular answer but her son was upset about the bikini so I wonder how exposed she is. Is it a string bikini? More information would help.", "I think it would be best if Ben made this decision on his own. If he is that uncomfortable he should no longer have friends over. He\u2019s off to college anyway I imagine so OP can wear what she wants without judgment. Perhaps this unfortunate incident will create some distance between Ben and his mother but it\u2019s worth it to teach him a lesson about bodily autonomy.", "You don't stop sexual harassment by forcing the woman to cover up. It's making it her fault for wearing something normal.", "Yes THIS \u261d\ufe0f", "It is NEVER ok for a guy to police what an adult woman wears in her own home and make her responsible for how men react. OP is NTA.", "Misogyny isn't just outright rage and hatred against women. Sometimes it's thinking that women need protecting from the *other* men, so they should do what the \"good ones\" tell them, because they are \"just looking out for them\". That's infantilizing and controlling, and it puts the responsibility on the woman instead of the young men who are sexualizing her. Bodies aren't inherently sexual, and if men can't control themselves in the presence of a woman's skin, it's not up to the woman to change *her* behavior.  Do you see what I'm saying? Misogyny isn't always as obvious as it is in the incel message boards, a lot of the time the people doing it have no idea they even have these internalized patriarchal ideas.", "You tell your idiot male friends to stop ogling women in general, but  more specifically your mother. Asking the woman to change is kinda like victim blaming....", "You can say something misogynistic and not hate women, or even be a misogynist. Ben and Greg are looking at this situation through a misogynistic viewpoint, (probably because they have been conditioned that way from living in a misogynistic society) but I don\u2019t think they hate women. Of course he is uncomfortable with his friends ogling his mom. They just need to learn that telling a woman what to wear because other men can\u2019t control their behavior is misogynistic and shouldn\u2019t be the solution.", "I'd love to see the expressions at the next get together. \"Welcome to the party! What size are you? Oh perfect, here's your modesty burkini, required for all guess. Men and women alike!\"", "The people asking to stop and blaming OP are her son and husband, not son's friends. So that dosen't make the friends inappropriate?", "They were and her number is 867-5309", "Both songs do sound similar, same beat", "He's not a misogynist for wanting to avoid an uncomfortable situation. He's a misogynist for wanting to restrict his mom's clothing as the solution to his problem.", "Or he could stop inviting his friends to his mom\u2019s own home if he\u2019s bothered. He and his friends aren\u2019t entitled to a pool party.", "Exactly. Nothing exists in a vacuum. As a parent you should be considering not only the immediate issue, but all the connected issues.\n\nDoes she have the right to wear what she wants? Sure.\n\nDoes Ben have the right to not tell his parents what he's up to in future because his mom is only considering her rights? Sure does.", "Sure you can ask for clarifying information but as it stands I feel like your comment is operating under the assumption that there is something else going on rather than actually going off of what was written.", "I would be worried about any teenager that did.", "I'm not like a regular mom. I'm a cool mom.", "They weren\u2019t hanging out, they were \u201cchilling\u201d. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "My thoughts exactly.", "I\u2019m in NorCal and it\u2019s freezing. This whole story sounds made up.", "My thoughts were the same.", "OMG please do this.", "\"Honey, adjust your Speedo.\"", "its a joke about mansplaining\n\nbait if you will", "He\u2019s only embarrassed because his friends are assholes and creeps that can\u2019t control themselves", "lol its really perverted that anyone would be like please dont wear the swimwear you want cause my friends cant control themselves. if a man or a woman cant control themselves from perving over a mother in her own home at a pool she allowed them to use then that\u2019s a them problem. you act like people have to completely conform to whatever their children want just because they\u2019re embarrassed, the only reason he was embarrassed was because men are allowed to sexualize women and the women have to change for them. makes no sense lmao.", "It does not make her TA though. Because on the flip side, if we are caring about feelings, it could hurt Mom\u2019s feelings for asking her to cover up.", "Many are also not like this. You must be around some shit kids.", "So women should just accept it and cover up to make them behave? \nSorry, but no. They need to be raised properly and not view women as objects.", "The son is the ah as well. \"Mother is attractive, mother mustn't be attractive. Remove mother.\" \n\nTelling someone to not wear a suit to a pool party because of their body is fucking ridiculous, ostracizing and isolating.  Not to mention, entitled, rude and presumptuous af. \n\nTelling someone to do this *at their own* pool party? Gtfo\n\nHe can either be uncomfortable and grow up, or he can host his free pool parties somewhere else. I wonder if any of the girls attending were unfortunate enough to be attractive. What if some if those friends happened  to be attracted to men? *GASP*!  All humans should only swim in full body potato sacks. There. No one gets to be objectified.", "I could only wish that I would be seen as attractive when I'm old enough to have teenage kids. My kids are only 4-6 and I'm already old, fat and getting uglier by the day.", "Nope, son is an AH and this is the opportunity to teach him that women aren\u2019t responsible for men\u2019s feelings or actions, that women are blamed and penalized and controlled far too often for their being objectified rather than the men who objectify them, and that he abd his associates are responsible for how they behave and act and have no business telling women to change or behave or dress differently on the ridiculous theory that they can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be in charge of handling their own urges.  Giving in to this demand sends a terrible message.", "In HS, anyone who saw me outside of school would ask me questions about the attractive boy I was with- where'd I find him, where's he from, does he have a brother, ect.\n\nIt was always my dad. ALWAYS. \n\n\"But he's attractive.\"\n\n\"Thanks. I look just like him. I'll let him know.\"", "Lol that\u2019s good for you. Absolutely irrelevant to OP.", "It doesn\u2019t matter.  They are acting misogynistic, and that is what counts right now.", "OP never said the party was held at her sons request only that since they lived in California they were able to host a party over winter break to celebrate his senior year. Where is the entitlement? The party could have been at OP\u2019s suggestion. She also states her son politely asked her not to wear a bikini around his friends. He\u2019s 18 and awkwardly embarrassed by his friends staring at his mom. She\u2019s not taking her child\u2019s feeling into account at all, only hers. Safe bet her son will never actually ask for a pool party with his friends after this. He\u2019ll hang with his friends outside of his home so he doesn\u2019t have to go through that again.", "OH OH OH. \n\nI guess I know how to make a sandwich but not how to tell a joke lmao", "Are you really so delusional that you think a man\u2019s chest is equally as sexual as a woman\u2019s?? It\u2019s why we show off our cleavage, to FEEL sexy. Anyone who argues the opposite is in denial.", "I'm not super concerned with why he was embarrassed just that he was. Maybe he didn't articulate his feelings well. I could certainly see how a mom in a bikini would be embarrassing regardless of whether teenage boys are staring or not.", "I don't think her son should be made to feel like a pervert because his friends look at his mother in her bikini. He expressed his dislike by using his words exactly what we want. I guess this could have been a teachable moment where she called back all his friends and told them no, I won't wear a one piece, it's your fault that you're looking at me and my son doesn't like it. My whole statement was this is not a hill to die on. Just change. Pick the countless other battles you'll have.", "Why would it hurt her feelings to be asked to cover up? But ok, I'll concede that no one is the asshole here. Lots of ppl seemed to think the kid was wrong for asking and that his friends were turds.", "Doesn't matter at all how they were raised.  Eighteen-year-old boys are going to notice a woman in a bikini unless they are gay.  And guys of all ages tease each other.  It's part of how many men bond with each other.", "The son was just doing what kids do when they start realizing their friends don't see their mom the way they see mom. This was a perfect time for him to learn some lessons about life. First of all had been my son I would have sat him down and talked about how uncomfortable I felt when stuff like that happened to me and that I understand how uncomfortable it can be but how you can't go around demanding people change the way they dress because of it. Also, don't start arguments with your friends. At some point he will think one of  his friends parents are attractive so he just learned a couple lessons in how not to be rude about it. Do do to them what he wouldn't want his friends to do him. Also it is a good time to discuss how there ae grown ups, both men and women, who will ake advantage of this situation and why it is not okay.\n\nInstead the 3 of the got into a huge fight and no one is talking to anyone and no good lesson came from the experience. The kid isn't a grown up and the whole point of parenting is to help lead them being a grown up.\n\nAlso, you could point all women in potato sacks and teen boys would still get horny so that wouldn't fix the problem. A slight breeze makes them horny. It is a part of going through puberty.", "We are all a MILF to someone", "Are you really so delusional to think a man\u2019s chest can\u2019t be considered sexual or sexy?\n\nAre you really so delusional to think not everyone consider women, and by extension their chest, as only a sexual use by men?\n\nAre you so delusional to think that every woman considers their chest as an object of sexual desire?", "Lol some of you really are so far removed. Yes, I am saying that womens chests are one million times more sexualized than mens and if you can\u2019t see that in todays world then you are delusional. It\u2019s why porn (and sex with a woman) is so focused on a woman\u2019s tits. How many people do you think are looking up \u201cmen\u2019s chests\u201d on pornhub?? Not saying people can\u2019t find them sexy but it is not the same thing. When was the last time grabbing a guys chest/sucking on their tits during sex was a common thing? When was the last time you heard someone say \u201care you a cock person or a chest person?\u201d Like you\u2019re crazy if you think they\u2019re not an inherently sexualized part of a woman\u2019s body. And no I\u2019m not saying every woman wants to be seen as sexy, but if you do that\u2019s a common way we do it.", "Thank you for a sane and realistic view.  I think some people (like the person you are replying to) are trying so hard to see everyone as equals that they feel guilty acknowledging the very real differences that exist.", "Yeah it\u2019s actually crazy to me! Like I can\u2019t imagine being so delusional", "On that note. Send boobs. Lol just kidding. But thank you for acknowledging reality. I don't know if it's porn and conditioning that sexualizes women's chests or it's just programmed into our DNA to see boobs as a sexual feature. In any case, the reality is, boobs are sexualized."]}
