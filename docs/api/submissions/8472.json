Thus, we chose to buy a house that had an outdoor pool and hot tub, as we knew how much we would love it, along with our kids Hannah (F23) and Ben (M18). In the three years since we moved into our house, we've hosted some great pool parties for family, friends, and both on different occasions.\n\nWe live in California, so a few weeks ago over Ben's winter break, we were able to host a pool party to allow him and his guy and girl friends to celebrate their upcoming last semester of high school. It was a good time, and Greg and I even chilled at the party for a bit too, while Hannah was out that day with friends. It's important to mention now that both Greg and I had also been in our bathing suits. Well, just yesterday, Ben politely asked if in the future, I could stop wearing bikinis at our pool parties in front of his friends. I was flabbergasted and asked why, and Ben reluctantly explained that he had caught some of his guy friends staring at points at the last pool party, and when he confronted them about it, they didn't deny it. Ben's friends said they'd stop in the future, but Ben still wasn't super comfortable about it. He said it was weird for his mom to be objectified like that by his friends, and asked if I could stop.\n\nI rolled my eyes and told Ben that his friends were being immature teenagers, but I would decide to take their word for it that they'd really stop if they're decent young men. Ben wasn't having it and got a little upset, and Greg came in after overhearing a good chunk of it. Greg agreed with Ben and said I should stop unless I want to be inappropriate around the teens. Frustrated, I told Greg and Ben to stop \"mansplaining\" to me and that nothing about swimsuits are inherently inappropriate, and that Greg was a hypocrite given he was in his trunks in front of Ben's friends. Greg told me I was being short-minded, and annoyed, I stormed out of the house and took a drive for a few hours. I got home half an hour ago and the house is silent and awkward.

Thus, we chose to buy a house that had an outdoor pool and hot tub, as we knew how much we would love it, along with our kids Hannah (F23) and Ben (M18). In the three years since we moved into our house, we've hosted some great pool parties for family, friends, and both on different occasions.\n\nWe live in California, so a few weeks ago over Ben's winter break, we were able to host a pool party to allow him and his guy and girl friends to celebrate their upcoming last semester of high school. It was a good time, and Greg and I even chilled at the party for a bit too, while Hannah was out that day with friends. It's important to mention now that both Greg and I had also been in our bathing suits. Well, just yesterday, Ben politely asked if in the future, I could stop wearing bikinis at our pool parties in front of his friends. I was flabbergasted and asked why, and Ben reluctantly explained that he had caught some of his guy friends staring at points at the last pool party, and when he confronted them about it, they didn't deny it. Ben's friends said they'd stop in the future, but Ben still wasn't super comfortable about it. He said it was weird for his mom to be objectified like that by his friends, and asked if I could stop.\n\nI rolled my eyes and told Ben that his friends were being immature teenagers, but I would decide to take their word for it that they'd really stop if they're decent young men. Ben wasn't having it and got a little upset, and Greg came in after overhearing a good chunk of it. Greg agreed with Ben and said I should stop unless I want to be inappropriate around the teens. Frustrated, I told Greg and Ben to stop \"mansplaining\" to me and that nothing about swimsuits are inherently inappropriate, and that Greg was a hypocrite given he was in his trunks in front of Ben's friends. Greg told me I was being short-minded, and annoyed, I stormed out of the house and took a drive for a few hours. I got home half an hour ago and the house is silent and awkward.

That way no one is uncomfortable.", "Because the kids aren\u2019t uncomfortable with the father wearing trunks.\n\nI\u2019m withholding judgment over whether its right or wrong for the son to be uncomfortable. But as a factual matter he is, and I fail to see why his mother wearing a bikini around his friends is important.\n\nIf parents were interjecting in a party by telling annoying jokes or stories, a child would ask them to cut it out too.

No, but it might be the right thing to do so kids can just enjoy themselves.", "And if a man felt the need to parade around in very small swimwear with the bulge of his penis visible to teenage girls?

On her dime, in her home.", "Exactly", "Sorry, but those boys are being creepy as hell. for many women, a bikini is the most comfortable option. She deserves to be comfortable in her own damn pool. If she was wearing something like a thong bikini, then sure. That's literally meant to be sexual, and innaproproate around young teenagers of any sex. But, assuming she's wearing a normal bikini (like most women wear to the pool or beach) then those boys need to grow up and realize that the world doesn't cater to them.
