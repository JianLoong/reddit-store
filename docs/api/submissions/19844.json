That\u2019s the thing about opinions though. They aren\u2019t right or wrong.

If he wanted a tattoo that was purposefully and outright antagonistic then sure get him away from it, but if hes like \u201cyeah its just a cool design\u201d then imo just get over it. If he goes to a pacific island like Samoa or something and its clearly \u201cwrong\u201d to them then they\u2019ll just roll their eyes and poke fun at the silly foreigner.", "ESH\n\nYou don't get to dictate what parts of a culture you don't belong to are shareable. \n\nThat said, I do think that anyone getting anything as permanent as a tattoo should do some research, especially if it draws inspiration from a culture they aren't a part of. You could have encouraged your boyfriend to do this research based on your understanding of the cultural significance of Polynesian tattoos.\n\nYour mom absolutely didn't need an opinion on this one. Your boyfriend had already moved to a different tattoo idea and as she is also not Polynesian, she also doesn't get to decide what aspects of Polynesian culture are sharable outside that culture.", "YTA. It's his body and his choice to wear whatever he wants on that body. There is always someone offended by something.

I asked if it was OK for me to get it done, because I wasn't sure. The artist that does mine explained to me that certain designs and placements are reserved for religious or special events, and those aren't for me, since I don't share the faith or heritage. But the pretty designs that don't have specific meaning are for anyone, because they're purely decorative. I feel like you can appreciate and wear art from other cultures as long as you're respectful of the boundaries that are set.", ">Side note: I think tattoo designs are just universal. The number of people who have tribal and other cultural styled tattoos is huge now. People just get what they want and that's okay.\n\nThe first example I can think of is that the Maori people (in New Zealand) have *T\u0101 moko* tattoos that are sacred to their culture. You've probably seen their face tattoos before even if you didn't know what they are called because they are a very distinctive style. However, the Maori people also have *kirituhi* tattoos that are offered to non-Maori people and they use the same storytelling techniques.\n\nIt would be offensive for an outsider to have a non-Maori tattoo artist put *T\u0101 moko* on their body, but that same person would be welcomed to have a Maori tattoo artist put *kirituhi* on them. \n\nAn outsider getting a *kirituhi* tattoo is cultural appreciation, because it's rooted in admiration for the Maori people, their storytelling, and their art. Getting a *T\u0101 moko* tattoo is *appropriation*, because that decision is based in disrespect for the Maori people. \n\nAs you said, many people get tribal tattoos. But the risk they run is that someone of that culture recognizes their disrespect and treats them commeasurately.\n\nEdit:: I'm bad at judging tone on the internet so I just want to clearly say that I am not attacking you, I just wanted to add to the conversation.

It's kapu (forbidden) and would definitely be very uncool to appropriate those designs.   Other designs are noa, common elements, so okay to utilize them.

Basically anything a Hindu can do, you are able to do.", "> I don't know if its really forbidden for non-Hindus to wear images of the gods \n\nIt's not. Hinduism doesn't really have a concept of a non-Hindu so it's perfectly acceptable for anyone to use those images.\n\nSome conservative Hindus might get offended if they thought the placement was disrespectful as you mentioned for example, tattooing a symbol on your boobs but most don't care.", "I know their perspective is much different than that of Abrahamic religions where you convert to join the 'club', but AFAIK all of us who would consider ourselves 'non-Hindus' are technically untouchables, no?

Do you think she'd be the AH for asking him to think about that one?", "That's fair. Over on r/indiancountry there's differing opinions, usually tribe by tribe, on the subjects of non-tribal members learning tribal languages. A lot of people are fascinated by Native cultures and go there asking if learning their languages is appropriation. And they'll receive a range of responses.\n\nSome tribes are all for it -- the more the merrier. Other tribes consider their languages to be a sacred part of their culture for their members, only. And then there's others who aren't opposed to outsiders learning their language, necessarily, but feel that non-tribal members should not take a slot in a language class if a tribal member is waiting for that slot. I say non-tribal members, because some tribes don't even want another Native from another tribe participating in their culture. So it's not so much a \"no white people\" thing as \"no outsiders, period\". And I think that's fair. Every tribal nation should be able to decide what's okay for them. \n\nI've even seen posters taking others to task for presuming that the way their tribe does is the same it should be. A Cree shouldn't be speaking for an Apache, any more than a white person should be speaking for an Apache, y'know?", "I think you would be more \"out-caste\" than untouchable but that's according to a certain set of religious rules. If you went by the very first ancient definition of caste, then you'd be classified according to your job. If we used the modern definition of caste, then you wouldn't have a caste at all, which is why a lot of Desis would be more okay with their kids marrying a white person than an untouchable Hindu."]}
