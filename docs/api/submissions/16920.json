And honestly, I get it. That would also not be the most fun thing for me. But I would have gone if I were you because your fianc\u00e9 specifically said this was important to her and you were specifically invited, so her family cared about you being there.  \n\nNow she and her family know you\u2019re the type of loser who doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her family if its not super convenient for you, and not only that but you\u2019ll lie about it to get out of the event. Why would she not think that you don\u2019t care about her?", "*\u201dI didn\u2019t really feel like spending my weekend celebrating a baby from someone I don\u2019t even know.\u201d*\n\nThis is a very selfish attitude. Are you under the impression that everything your partner joins in with you is her first choice activity? \n\nYour partner asked you to join her and you lied and manipulated her instead. If I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9e, I\u2019m rethinking my commitment to you right now.", "YTA - it was your chance to get to know someone your fiance clearly showed was important to her.\n\nI don't know anyone who really enjoys going to a baby shower, we go to support the people we love. Instead, you lied to the person you claim to love.", "OP BFFR. Being in a relationship means you end up doing things you don\u2019t want to do or don\u2019t feel like doing all the time. You think I want to drive hours to sit at my husbands grandmas nursing home?uh no. It\u2019s boring as fuck and depressing. But I do it anyway because I care about him more than my desire to not go. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s likely she does things for and with you that she doesn\u2019t want to do? \n\nI think what\u2019s worse though is that you were exposed not just as selfish but as a liar. And worse that you expect your friends to also maintain your lies!!! What else would they cover up for you, is what I would genuinely be wondering. You might think it\u2019s a harmless white lie, but I would be wondering what else you would lie and cover up to \u201cspare my feelings\u201d. \ud83e\udd14", "In your post you said you met her?", "That's what you do for your partner. If you can't do that, then you're not mature enough for marriage.", "Anyone who encourages you to lie to your partner is not a good 'friend'", "Yes, as something with problems with confrontation this is quite literally the definition. It was ruined some of my relationships, don\u2019t let it ruin yours. Or do, your girlfriend may be better off with someone who cares about her and her family.", "Tell her what you just wrote here (about your dad), then promise never to do it again and mean it. She\u2019ll want to see that you understand why it was wrong and you\u2019re not just apologetic that she found out.", "Yeah I get that but also my reasons were to avoid hurting her, I didn't intend to hurt her", "So glad I wasn\u2019t the only one who eyerolled when I read chocolate and flowers, it\u2019s weak", "No, I've been in another long time relationship before, why?", "i mean, i've met a bunch of my cousins from my dads side before but I don't know them like at all. I think I know like 3 of their names and theres like at least 4??? maybe up to like 12??? idk \n\nIt is possible to meet someone one time and not know them...  though op is 100000% TA", "Okay thank you, I'll do that, I'm a bit embarrassed about telling her that about my mom and my dad but I will", "Why do you keep harping on what your intent was when the impact that was that she was hurt regardless? Probably moreso than if you\u2019d been honest that you don\u2019t care about her or her family.", "Your reason was you wanted to avoid doing something but also avoid dealing with a possibly negative reaction. That\u2019s not a white lie, it\u2019s a regular lie. You didn\u2019t lie to spare her feelings, you lied because it seemed more convenient. \n\nYTA all the way.", "You did it to avoid hurting her? Or, because you wanted an easy way out of not going?", "no one cares what your intent was. you DID hurt her and that\u2019s what matters. have you even apologized??", "The intent doesn\u2019t matter. The result is what matters", "I'm just surprised you haven't learned this before, plus the ultra stereotypical tv trope of trying to fix it with flowers and chocolates", "I understand but try not to be embarrassed. You were a child and that situation was out of your control. Strong lasting relationships are founded on honesty, even when it\u2019s hard. Good luck.", "Well, I did similar white lies with my ex too but she never found out the truth so I guess I was fine. And my mom was always in a good mood after my dad brought her flowers and chocolate so I thought I could use that too but I guess it's not a good idea, is it?", "Yes you're right, is very dumb to feel that way I'll talk to her and hopefully we can make up", "Maybe stop lying to people", "Women aren't video game characters. You can't just throw gifts at us and expect your relationship points to go up.\n\nGiving a person a gift that they enjoy is a way to show that you're thinking about them, and that you know them well enough to give them something they like. That makes people happy. But it's not a cheat code to fixing fundamental trust and communication issues.\n\nIf you want to repair your relationship, should start by understanding that you messed up, acknowledging to her that you messed up, and change your behavior so that it doesn't happen again. And even then, she doesn't have to forgive you.", "I refuse to believe you\u2019re a real human.", "Chocolate and flowers are great, when given for no reason other than you want to show your love. Apologize (without justifying by saying, I didn\u2019t want to hurt you) and tell her how you are going to work on being a better partner. I would highly suggest pre marital counseling. I think it might also be a sweet gesture of you arrange a trip to go meet up with her cousin and family to show that you do care about her family and feelings.", "oh you have never seen another woman as an equal\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d what kind of condescending bullshit is this? \u201chi honey, i know i disrespected you, lied to you, and basically pissed on all the trust you had in me but you should forgive me because i got you chocolate and roses\ud83e\udd7a\ud83e\udd7a\u201d you don\u2019t even care to make it right, you just want her to get over it so she\u2019ll stop being mad. you are not ready for marriage or even a casual date because you don\u2019t take the woman you\u2019re with seriously and you don\u2019t respect her, and this is obviously a pattern. grow the fuck up dude.", "If she is your fiancee then that means you want to spend the rest of your life with her.  Being able to communicate is key.  Does my wife want to do things that I don't want to? Yes.  Do I have events that she doesn't want to attend? Yes.  Part of a true long term relationship if finding that middle ground and at the same time if you don't want to go, be open about it and discuss it.  No more lies because you don't want to hurt her feelings.", "I will", "Why? I am real, I know I fucked up but I want to fix things with my fianc\u00e9 and change so she can trust me, I know that probably doing stuff my parents used to do it's not a good idea but I don't know, it's all I can think now"]}
