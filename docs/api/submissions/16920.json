Our relationship is very good, really we don't have problems at all, we're thinking on getting married and are looking forward to marriage. \n\nWell, her family lives away in another state, about five hours of distance. I don't have a problem with them, they're fine. Because of the distance we have only been able to met a couple times. \n\nWell, about two months ago fianc\u00e9 received a invitation to a baby shower for her cousin. She told me she was very excited because her and her cousin are close and it's her first baby. Of course I was invited too, I wasn't thrilled at all. I have only met this cousin a couple times, I have no interest on this baby. \n\nOriginally I said yes but then the week of the baby shower came and I wasn't feeling driving five hours to go at all. So I told my fianc\u00e9 that I had a work emergency and I needed to make a small trip, she didn't asked many questions so I wss lucky for that. This was my friend's (m29) idea.\n\n I told her that I will try to come back to go to the baby shower with her. And then my friend and I left. Then I called her and told her I won't be able to make it. So she went on her own, then I came back and everything was fine. \n\nShe never found out the truth until last week, my friend and his wife came over to our house to have dinner. Then his wife fucked up and accidentally spoiled the truth. My fianc\u00e9 then got angry at me because I lied. After they left she asked me why didn't I just told her I didn't want to go to the baby shower with her, I told her I didn't want to hurt her feelings. We argued and now she's being distant.\n\nEdit: I spoke to my fianc\u00e9 as some people suggested, I asked her to forgive me and told her about my parents. She knew very little about this, only that they used to fight all the time and they stayed together because of me, I told her about their fights and honestly I was embarrassed but she was supportive. I told her I'll search for a therapist today, she told me she'll help me, she told me she's hurt, but she'll give me a chance to regain her trust if she can see I'm trying. I think this is the only time I've cried in front of her besides the day we got engaged. Thank you for the comments, I'm glad I posted here, who knows how many times I would've hurt the ones I love if I didn't post here and hot called out (rightfully)", "created_utc": 1683741362, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13dy73a/aita_for_faking_a_work_emergency_to_skip_a_party/", "score": 1643, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Getting married means sometimes you suck it up and go to events you're not the most excited about because they mean a lot to your wife. And once you're married, these people aren't just going to be her family; they're going to be yours, too. If I were your fiancee I'd be reevaluating the relationship, because she's probably wondering if there's anything else you've lied about in the past that she didn't find out about.", "When the hell did men start going to baby showers?? YTA. Not cause you didn\u2019t want you go but because you lied to her. I\u2019m wondering if your friends wife really \u2018slipped up\u2019 or if she was wanting to tell your wife all along.

You're just a really selfish person lol.  You probably knew your reason for not going wasn't great, so that's the reason you lied... not cause you cared about her feelings lol.... if you cared about her feelings you would never have created this situation, because it could all have been avoided by just being supportive and attending.\n\nI just keep going back to how selfish you are, because you know this baby shower is important to your fiance, but because of your selfish nature oh the baby doesn't mean anything to you cause you barely know the cousin... who cares?  It's not all about YOU.", "YTA", ">I have only met this cousin a couple times, I have no interest on this baby.\n\nKnow how you could get to know this cousin better?
