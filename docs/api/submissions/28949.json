And we didn't mess around when he would pursue a relationship with someone or was in a relationship. I personally haven't been in a relationship since wayyy before we started this arrangement.\n\nRoughly 2-3weeks ago I confessed to him that I was in love with him. After a long conversation he admitted he loves me too but we would take it day by day since we've been friends for over 10yrs. Last week we finally had sex with one another (I have issues with intimacy and I need full trust in order to have sex with someone.) And everything seemed perfect. \n\nWe admitted that everything we've ever done together just feels right and easy. He's even said I made him feel things he never thought he'd ever feel again after his last heart break. Calling each other pet names, planning possible get aways, etc. He even said \"you belong to me and I belong to you\" while we were expressing our love for each other.\n\nThis is where it all went down. My other friend (F26) sent him tiktok about sending your significant other flowers (my bday is within a month). His response to said video was \"that's sweet and upsetting\". When I asked why would it be upsetting he claimed that giving me flowers or anything could trigger him due to his last heart break..\n\nI immediately said \"So saying I love you and making love wasn't too far but you are drawing the line at flowers?\" Which to he responded pretty much by saying he's not sure if he could commit considering he doesn't \"feel like a monogamous person\". This was never mentioned beforehand to me and if it was I would have never continued with our arrangement which he knew I am monogamous. \n\nI told him I can't anything with him if he's still hung up over someone else. And if he can't commit to me the way I'm committing to him. And I pretty much cut contact with him right away.\n\nDid I over react?\n\nEdit:\nForgot to mention I found out his ex received roses about a month ago for their birthday even tho they've been broken up for months at this point.", "created_utc": 1697334366, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1784og6/aita_did_i_f27_over_react_to_my_best_friends_m28/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To me, yes, giving someone flowers has more serious/long-term implications than having sex with someone. And sure, he's allowed to question his ability to be monogamous, but going forward, you probably shouldn't assume that, and he definitely should've communicated this earlier. \n\nBest case, he got cold feet. He was an asshole in this situation, and who knows, maybe asshole isn't a strong enough word, but I also don't have complete context.\n\nYou may want to consider seeking out a therapist or something, to talk about this situation in full. I'm worried because you called him your best friend, and seems like you already have a tough time with trust."]}
