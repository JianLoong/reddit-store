By not reacting to a statement like this, they are teaching her that sexism is okay, and that *her own worth as a woman* is going to be dependent on her chastity. That is a horrible thing for any young girl to learn, and it's worrying that she picked this stuff up somewhere. Not to mention that they are totally throwing you under the bus here. You are older than your sister, but you're still their child, and it's their job as parents to see both of your points of view.\n\nI hope this doesn't put a dent in what sounds like an otherwise great sibling relationship between you two.", "[deleted]", "NAH and neither is your sister.
