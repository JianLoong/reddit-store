I\u2019ve only been moved in for about 3 weeks now. This is the first real friction I\u2019ve had with either of them.\n\nThe issue is that Ben has a very sweet, shy dog, Zoro (~75lb GSD mix) and I have 2 cats (a youngish friendly orange named Ump and my old lady calico, Daisy). Ump has decided he loves the dog and would like to be his BFF immediately and unfortunately, it turns out poor Zoro is terrified of the cats. We did do slow introductions at first but we took Zoro\u2019s avoidance of the initial cat room/doors/gates as disinterest so we thought it would be fine to let them mingle and then we saw what was really happening. \n  \nDaisy seems pleased with Zoro\u2019s fear of her, to be honest.. she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to bother him; she\u2019s 16 & uninterested but she certainly liked how fast he would get out of her way. You can see it in her lil sashay. But she ignores him otherwise. \n\nSweet Ump tried to approach him twice with happy tail and head bumps and Zoro booked it out of the room in terror. We scaled back the introductions again and set up a tall gate on the landing to keep them all separated on different floors for now.\n\nIn my mind, there\u2019s no problems here. Zoro is afraid, yes but neither Ump nor Daisy is being aggressive or antagonistic towards him. We just need to go more slowly and give him time to adjust to an entirely new type of creature and he\u2019ll be okay. In fact, I\u2019m positive once he realizes Ump is soft, warm & safe, he\u2019ll want to cuddle too. But everything will be fine soon; no one needs to be punished or corrected here. No one did anything wrong. It\u2019s a just matter of patience \n\nBen is upset that Zoro is upset and David is upset that Ben is upset. They\u2019ve worked each other up into a tizzy about how \u201cthis isn\u2019t working!!\u201d and finding a \u201csolution\u201d right now. Their \u201csolutions\u201d have included: keeping Ump & Daisy locked in one room permanently so Zoro can\u2019t see them through the gate, \u201ctraining\u201d the cats to not go near/look at the dog via spraying/loud noises & rehoming Ump. \n\nObviously none of these are acceptable to me and I have refused all of them, saying I\u2019d rather move back out than punish my cats for existing. I\u2019m definitely not giving away my cat for being too friendly. David got really upset when I said I\u2019d move out and said it would be choosing my cats over him & his son which would be the end of our relationship. which I don\u2019t want but I\u2019m not going to appease such an over the top reaction & I\u2019m disappointed in how he\u2019s handling this.\n\nAm I the asshole? Am I crazy?

Having a new woman and her two cats suddenly move into your home as a thirteen year old boy is going to take some time to get used to. It'll take a bit to get comfortable with the new dynamics. Of course a thirteen year old boy is going to be upset if it was always just them chilling and now his dog is stressed and he has to share his dad too. It's understandable too that Dad doesn't want to see his son upset over something that is being caused by him and his relationship.\n\nAt the same time, you and the cats were invited to move in and them being animals need to be given some grace and have an adjustment period so that the animals can get used to the new dynamics as well. It doesn't sound like anyone has done anything wrong, maybe an open and honest family meeting may be helpful though.", "NAH - Both you and David overreacted here but I don't think that makes you an asshole. You should have given them space to calm down and then talked to David alone about how animals can take around 3 months to adjust to one another and new environments. David could then go talk to Ben.

If that's the case, David deserves an apology. Should've chosen your words kindly, so a little bit of an AH move.\n\nHowever, regarding the pets, they are a part of the family. David wouldn't \"discipline\" Ben by locking him in a room and spraying/making loud noises. He shouldn't be okay with doing that to your cats.

He's just never been socialized around cats.  How is he with other dogs on walks and such?\n\nMaybe try feeding them all together at the same time?  Is Zoro food motivated?  Maybe have a training/treat session where he and Ump are near each other?", "I couldn't get past all the cutesy pet stuff, sorry.", "NTA. The options they suggested are not fair to the cats. Locking them in one room for the rest of their lives is a pretty insane solution. How would they feel if you suggested Zoro just lives the rest of his life in one room? I don't think they'd go for that at all, because it's equally ridiculous.\n\nThe water bottles and stuff is also not how you train a cat. They are not like dogs and may not associate their behavior with the negative reinforcement, so it's pointless all around. You'd be spraying water on your cats which is unpleasant, and they may not have any clue why you're doing it so nothing is being learned. \n\nI think all the pets probably just need time. No one is being aggressive at this point, so I think it's best to give them more time to adjust on their own and over time. When introducing cats, you usually feed them near each other to teach them a positive association. Maybe to help Zoro realize the cats are not a threat, you could feed them this way. Start with their bowls at a distance where they can still see each other but are comfortable, and move them closer each meal as long as everyone remains comfortable. \n\nDon't try to force the cats on Zoro though. If he's scared and feels cornered, he might react with aggression and he's much bigger than the cats. I think having a safe area where Zoro can go when he wants to retreat from the cats is a good idea too.", "NTA but there are two different perspectives here.

He's obviously unfamiliar with cats, and it doesn't matter to HIM that the cat isn't aggressive, he THINKS it is.

Don't become apprehensive and suspicious and nervous. Just give the dog treats and say \"good boy\" and go about your day. The dog is more the problem than the cats and taking it to training would help a lot. Also, crate training!! If a dog learns to love their crate, they go in there to decompress and get away from stressor and to recharge their confidence. Having a safe space such as a crate to go to when he's overwhelmed will help him a lot.

I was so scared she would chase the cats and view them as a toy.\n\nChasing cats is 1000000x more dangerous and more likely to lead to a dead cat than anything else.\n\nMy Aussie is very, very safe around cats now. When she is bothered, she gets up and leaves.\n\nThey should of course, separate the dog when it is time for the dog to eat. Cats should never be allowed around food bowls when dogs are eating.

Three weeks is not enough for everyone to adjust to their new living situation. If I was in your shoes, I wouldn't want to re-home my cat or lock him away.\n\nWe have a dog and two cats. One cat is very shy, so we don't have to worry about her interactions with the dog very much. The other cat is an Abyssinian. He is weird even for a cat. Inter-species communication is difficult at best, but throw in his strangeness and some situations can arise. We watch him as closely as possible so that the cat knows he has limits and the dog knows he doesn't have to tolerate the cat all the time.\n\nFor example, the cat loves it when the dog licks his ears. It goes something like this. He walks straight up to the dog. If the dog doesn't lick his ears when he \"asks,\" he expresses his annoyance with a loud, irritated meow. From the dog's perspective, this little creature walked right at him, got in his face, and started meowing at him. None of these are friendly gestures to a dog. We as humans know that the cat is trying to be sweet. But from the dog's perspective, the cat is being mildly aggressive. My point with all this is to illustrate that while you may see Ump as being sweet, the dog may not. My advice is for David and Ben to interact with the cats where Zoro can watch. Dogs take cues from their owners. Also, if Ump tries to interact with Zoro and he starts shrinking away, then stop the interaction. That lets Zoro know that he doesn't have to \"defend\" himself. (Maybe defend seems like the wrong word because you know Ump is just trying to be nice. Then again if we think about it from the dog's perspective, maybe it is the right word.) If it comes to that, call a behaviorist (NOT a trainer). Have them evaluate everyone's behavior. They can give you tips to help everyone get along better or in the worst case, let you know that they cannot cohabitate. Obviously not something you would want to hear, but that's better than a fight erupting. But again I am talking about worst case scenarios.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add something. Again, you don't want Zoro to feel like he has no choice but to defend himself. Some people have the misconception that dogs should just tolerate anything and everything. That is just not reasonable. Dogs have limits. They should not have to tolerate something 24/7/365 without end or limits. You wouldn't either. So don't put him in a position where he has to. The humans are the ones who set the limits and the rules for all the creatures in the house including the cats.", "NTA.  Dudes are trippin over cats and dogs acting like cats and dogs.

He basically only wants to be touched or played with on his own schedule, and gets immediately bothered when anyone touches him or tries to get him to play when he doesn't want to. He never in his life would play with any other dogs, with or without toys. But in early 2021, roommate fell in love with a puppy that her coworker brought in to the office after he dog had an unplanned litter, and so she brought home this tiny thing that was half chihuahua and who knows what else, that she named Pippin. Frisket was immediately unhappy with it, wanted nothing to do with the little thing. Would not play with it, wouldn't share his toys with it, would get mad if the pup touched one of his THREE beds around the house. Huge diva fit. Now, 2.5 years later, Frisket plays with Pippin every day. He runs and wrestles, they share tug toys, he even lets Pippin playfully bit his face and neck. He gets sad and mopey around the house if Pippin gets taken somewhere without him. If Pip lets out a yelp in pain or surprise, Frisket comes running to protect him. They even lay down on the same bed together sometimes, although Frisket will walk off if he realizes you're looking at them. It didn't take the full 2 years for them to start getting along, and we honestly probably missed some first looks at the growth while we were at work. And they still occasionally have little spats, just like anyone else does! But all the work has been worth it to watch them both be better because of the relationship.

It was wild that the husband thought OP was an asshole for checking the dashcam footage without his permission, but I assume that was just an attempt to deflect. OP's comments made it clear that she saved the footage and immediately contacted a lawyer to get rid of his sorry ass. I really hope she also got him charged with animal abandonment/cruelty.", "Well the original post and this comment were posted over 10 hours ago.\n\nSometimes the early reactions are misleading.", "Someone send this to Stephen King. Sounds like a great horror movie", "My ex\u2019s rabbit chased and whacked my dachshund.", "Oh my god, I'm sure that rabbit lives with me now. That sounds exactly like something muffin would do. The cat knows to keep out of her way. (And muffin is tiny, the cat is pretty big)", "Our rabbit turned mean as well. Never trust 'em. We've had loads of dogs, guinea pigs, and hamsters, none of them were mean.", "I love this story", "I like my cat, but I still call her an asshole, because she is.", "i dont care that there are people who dont like cats, i dont understand dogs same as you dont get cats, but the fact theres countless stories that show people think them lesser pets than dogs", "It\u2019s okay to not want your family member to feel discomfort, it\u2019s not okay to hurt someone else\u2019s family member in response. OP is already keeping the cats away from the dog to ease his suffering. Dad and son don\u2019t think that\u2019s good enough and want her to put the cat in a situation that will hurt the cat much more than the dog\u2019s current and temporary discomfort.", "Maybe, but the other comment was posted five hours later.", "We have two male rabbits from the same litter that liked each other fine until they hit sexual maturity.  From then on, they were at each other's throats if they could find a way through the barrier we put up in their room.  We even found out from the vet tech at their neutering appointment that one of them had healing scabs on his balls because the other one was able to bite him there.  Poor guy!  They no longer try to get at each other, and one of them even licks the other through the barrier sometimes, but we know they may never be comfortable actually sharing territory.", "Yup.", "He\u2019s 13", "This is glorious", "ESH... the boys disregard the wellbeeing of the cats and you disregard the wellbeeing of the dog. Such introductions are best made before to see if things work out. Makes me sad that so little thought was put into it here.", "NTA\n\nOnly three weeks?  It takes A LOT OF TIME and PATIENCE to get them used to each other.  Some takes about 3 months....some about 6 months.  It varies.  Your cats are friendly.....I'd give it three to four months, they'd sleep together like the buddies.  Yeah, your bf and his son are overreacting.  Their alternative solutions won't work at all.  None.", "NTA - But why don't you bring in an animal trainer who handles just these type of situations that can perhaps speed up the process some.", "NTA. Ben should be told by his dad to suck it up and stop being so dramatic. Dad needs to suck it up too and stop being a snow plow parent.", "NTA \n\nI would move out too. They do need to give it time, especially if there is no aggression. They are overreacting and need to chill, i feel the same as you, the cats are just existing.", "NTA. I have a very nervous cat who I moved in with a nervous/aggressive dog. It took them nearly 6 months to warm up to each other, but eventually it was fine.\n\nAnimal introductions take time. 3 weeks won't cut it. It sounds like you are doing everything right.", "NTA\nI agree with your \"let this play out\" solution in  regardless to the pets situation.  \n\n David sucks  for his \"would be choosing cats over us\" overreaction. And for his \"let's lock up the cats\" solution.  I find it insane that he put forward a solution that he most likely wouldn't accept for zoro.", "NTA. 100% choose your cats. He's being completely unreasonable. He could use this as a teachable moment for his kid but he's flying off the handle and acting like it's the end of the world. Kids have hurt feelings sometimes. He should be teaching his kid how to regulate his emotions not becoming an unreasonable asshole to avoid his kid ever having bad emotions.", "NTA. But in all likelihood this isn't going to end amicably. It seems by their reactions that your boyfriend and his son have their minds pretty made up.", "NTA as a dog trainer, they need to seek private lessons yesterday. Build up that dogs confidence and do tether training at home. It is THEIR fault that they are not being good dog handlers. Dogs need us to help and guide them, not just baby proof everything that doesn\u2019t go perfectly", "I think it sounds like your cats have adapted very well to a new environment. Better than most cats. It's funny they're saying \\*your\\* cats need trained when it's \\*their\\* dog causing the issue, and \\*you're\\* choosing your animals, when they're doing the same to you. \n\nIt's either wait for the dog to realize there's nothing to be scared of, or move out. Rehoming pets that already have a home is cruel. It's a lifetime commitment. NTA.", "NTA, would he rehome the dog? probably not, so why would he bring you rehoming at least one of your cats up? please do yourself a favour and move back out and keep the relationship going as it was before or discuss your values and rethink it. it's fine when animals are shy and a bit scared at first, as long as there is no violence. i hope the dog doesn't hurt your cats when scared though, please be aware of that danger.", "NTA. You are doing nothing wrong. Ump seems to be a sweetie and Zoro just needs to overcome his fear. \n\nI'm more of a dog person, but cat gives excellent cuddles and I wish my girls would like them as much as I do \ud83d\ude14", "They're keeping them on different floors in the meantime so they can introduce each other slowly. If OP's cats were distressed by the dog I expect their solution would be much the same, because locking one animal away entirely is not a viable solution to the problem. What you're proposing is precisely the sort of slower introduction that OP's in favor of.", "This is a really weird response? She's not suggesting Zorro leave, she's saying she'll take the cats and move out if the boyfriend won't give them all the time to adjust.", "I learned as a young child that rabbits are fluffy little assholes.
