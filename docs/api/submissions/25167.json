I\u2019ve only been moved in for about 3 weeks now. This is the first real friction I\u2019ve had with either of them.\n\nThe issue is that Ben has a very sweet, shy dog, Zoro (~75lb GSD mix) and I have 2 cats (a youngish friendly orange named Ump and my old lady calico, Daisy). Ump has decided he loves the dog and would like to be his BFF immediately and unfortunately, it turns out poor Zoro is terrified of the cats. We did do slow introductions at first but we took Zoro\u2019s avoidance of the initial cat room/doors/gates as disinterest so we thought it would be fine to let them mingle and then we saw what was really happening. \n  \nDaisy seems pleased with Zoro\u2019s fear of her, to be honest.. she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to bother him; she\u2019s 16 & uninterested but she certainly liked how fast he would get out of her way. You can see it in her lil sashay. But she ignores him otherwise. \n\nSweet Ump tried to approach him twice with happy tail and head bumps and Zoro booked it out of the room in terror. We scaled back the introductions again and set up a tall gate on the landing to keep them all separated on different floors for now.\n\nIn my mind, there\u2019s no problems here. Zoro is afraid, yes but neither Ump nor Daisy is being aggressive or antagonistic towards him. We just need to go more slowly and give him time to adjust to an entirely new type of creature and he\u2019ll be okay. In fact, I\u2019m positive once he realizes Ump is soft, warm & safe, he\u2019ll want to cuddle too. But everything will be fine soon; no one needs to be punished or corrected here. No one did anything wrong. It\u2019s a just matter of patience \n\nBen is upset that Zoro is upset and David is upset that Ben is upset. They\u2019ve worked each other up into a tizzy about how \u201cthis isn\u2019t working!!\u201d and finding a \u201csolution\u201d right now. Their \u201csolutions\u201d have included: keeping Ump & Daisy locked in one room permanently so Zoro can\u2019t see them through the gate, \u201ctraining\u201d the cats to not go near/look at the dog via spraying/loud noises & rehoming Ump. \n\nObviously none of these are acceptable to me and I have refused all of them, saying I\u2019d rather move back out than punish my cats for existing. I\u2019m definitely not giving away my cat for being too friendly. David got really upset when I said I\u2019d move out and said it would be choosing my cats over him & his son which would be the end of our relationship. which I don\u2019t want but I\u2019m not going to appease such an over the top reaction & I\u2019m disappointed in how he\u2019s handling this.\n\nAm I the asshole? Am I crazy? I feel like it\u2019s an extreme, ridiculous overreaction (from David; I expect the black & white thinking from Ben) to such a mild situation that I think will resolve itself very shortly but everyone I talk to in my life is like \u201cwell that\u2019s his kids feelings, what do you expect?\u201d And I feel like I\u2019m losing my mind here.", "created_utc": 1692620970, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15x6ats/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_he_and_his_son/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like any of the animals are physically hurting one another.  If they don't want the cats at their house, move back. If he's going to break up with you because of that, he obviously isn't the one.", "NTA. Three weeks is still early stages. Their solution to lock up one cat and rehouse the other is cruel to you and the cats.", "NTA\n\nYou are introducing 2 cats into a new home with an existing dog. It takes time for everyone to find their new pack routine\n\nAs long as they are not being aggressive or attacking, it's fine. Zoro should have a safe space if needed, but they are definitely overreacting", "NTA. Flip it back on him to show some perspective. Throw his ill logic back at him with \u201cyou\u2019re choosing the dog over me\u201d. It\u2019s just as silly.", "NTA - It's only been 3 weeks.  They've got to give is more time.", "NTA. It takes time for animals to get used to each other regardless of species. It sounds like you are doing the best you can and your cats aren\u2019t terrorizing the dog. The dog will come around, hopefully.", "NAH\n\nI suspect this may go beyond just the animals. Having a new woman and her two cats suddenly move into your home as a thirteen year old boy is going to take some time to get used to. It'll take a bit to get comfortable with the new dynamics. Of course a thirteen year old boy is going to be upset if it was always just them chilling and now his dog is stressed and he has to share his dad too. It's understandable too that Dad doesn't want to see his son upset over something that is being caused by him and his relationship.\n\nAt the same time, you and the cats were invited to move in and them being animals need to be given some grace and have an adjustment period so that the animals can get used to the new dynamics as well. It doesn't sound like anyone has done anything wrong, maybe an open and honest family meeting may be helpful though.", "NAH - Both you and David overreacted here but I don't think that makes you an asshole. You should have given them space to calm down and then talked to David alone about how animals can take around 3 months to adjust to one another and new environments. David could then go talk to Ben. You jumping automatically to \"I will just move out\" instead of taking a break and having a conversation is also an overreaction. \n\nBen is 13 while it seems like an overreaction hes still growing emotionally so it would be unfair to categorize it as that.", "NTA at all, but I am a person with a cat and dog so I know this is all par for the course. Your bf should be calming his son down and not freaking out on you. I'm not one for telling people how to parent but for a 13 yr old this is a relatively mild stressor he should be able to work through without everyone having a breakdown and you having to talk about moving out! I'm sorry you're going through this!", "Nta, your solution to me is correct. I would 100% move out if they aren\u2019t willing to wait for the dog to become comfortable. Punishing cats doesn\u2019t work at all, that\u2019s not how training them works. \n\nThey seem to be unable to compromise.", "NTA\n\nMaybe over analyzing...but sounds like the kiddo is projecting his fear/anxiety about you moving in onto his dog, which the dad is trying to fix and taking it out onto you. This is a massive event in the life of the son, suggest looking at it through his eyes, his young life. The divorce and all that leads up to it, the safety of his dad/dog/apartment. Now two cats and a woman. \n\nSuggest not looking at it as some type of next step. Moving in with a family is a massive change for everyone with all sorts of future implications that sound like they may not have been discussed with the son. Is this pseudo marriage, playing house, just seemed like the right thing to do, etc. \n\nOverall yes...the animal will likely simply resolve but doesn't sound like there is anything of danger or whatnot happening. Just give them space and let them live.", "It took MONTHS for our cats and fog to get along. I'm pro-dog, but feel I still needed to protect the cats. Everyone else was pro-cats and was yelling at the dog constantly. He was just curious and bored.

It takes time for animals from two homes to get used to each other's presence and honestly, what do they have against your cats? It'd be somewhat of a spectacle if you were to act the same each time you have different opinions with each other, shouting \"this isn't working!\" But then, of course, you'd be the dubbed \"overreacting\" one.", "NTA for not abandoning your family (cats) whom you promised a lifelong commitment to. \n\nTheir solutions make no sense", "NTA\n\nHe accuses you for ending the relationship over your cats, when he is choosing to end it over a dog.\n\nYour method should work with time, but if they are not going to give it a chance, this is an indication of how your living there going forward will be.\n\nHopefully, you can move back to your old place.", "ESH (except Ben he\u2019s 13) \n\nAre you sure y\u2019all are ready to live together? \n\n\u201cIn my mind, there\u2019s no problem here\u201d & none of their suggestions are \u201cacceptable to me\u201d.

Or just move out ....\n\neta \u2014 have either of you even considered that Ben may have some other issues that he\u2019s stressed about & is just focusing all that on the dog? This is kind of a big change in his life.", "Make sure your cats are microchipped and keep a close eye on them. I have seen so many \u201cgo missing\u201d in these situations. They are usually driven and abandoned somewhere they don\u2019t know, or taken to a shelter or a friend that\u2019s in on it. Your cats aren\u2019t safe.\n\nIt\u2019s been three weeks. That\u2019s no time at all. It took months with my cats. \n\nNTA but you will be if you abandon them or put them at risk.", "I'd be worried that they'd try to 'rehome' the cats sometime when you weren't home.  And by 'rehome' I mean driving them far away and booting them out of the car.\n\nBut then, I read far too much reddit, plus I like my cats more than I like most humans.", "NTA. This is a non-issue and your bf is totally blowing it out of proportion. You should think long and hard about if you really want to be with a man who'd rather force you to rehome your 16 year old cat than ask his teenaged son to demonstrate a little patience. What other concessions are going to be demanded of you any time Ben is mildly upset about something?", "NTA This shouldn't be an issue and they are over reacting. Good luck with all that", "Obviously none of these are acceptable to me and I have refused all of them, saying I\u2019d rather move back out than punish my cats for existing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou should definitely do that. Definitely. \n\nYTA", "NTA just look at the other comments", "NAH so obviously this is going to be an adjustment for everyone and emotions are high with all the changes(which i am sure isnt helping the animals- they truly react to their owners emotions). I think they are overreacting and you are underreacting. This is a problem, but not one where they must start locking cats in a room permanently. Maybe do some research on how to desensitize dogs and cats to each other, try some positive reinforcement with the dog and the cat that likes him. If yall cant figure it out try a trainor.", "NTA, the issue is the son being upset his dog is afraid of cats LOL", "i don\u2019t understand the y ta comments. she\u2019s doing everything she can to properly introduce and socialize new pets. if only options are locking them in a room or rehoming them then i\u2019d leave too NTA", "So he\u2019s allowed to choose the dog but you can\u2019t choose the cat. Wild. Sounds like a control issue not an animal issue", "David thinking you are prioritising your cats over the relationship is valid because to me it seems like that was your initial response, before even attempting to come up with different solutions. If that's the case, David deserves an apology. Should've chosen your words kindly, so a little bit of an AH move.\n\nHowever, regarding the pets, they are a part of the family. David wouldn't \"discipline\" Ben by locking him in a room and spraying/making loud noises. He shouldn't be okay with doing that to your cats. And he should talk to Ben about being patient and giving the animals more time to adjust, as you suggested. The animals are being civil, so it's not like there's a safety issue. \n\nSo NTA, but you should still apologise for your words.", "I don't see that ending well, I'm prepared for an aita post where possibly the son will take Ump out of the house and you yelling at him", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

None of his \u201csuggestions\u201d are helping the issue, which is the dogs anxiety around the cats. What if the neighbours get a cat who looks at their dog? Does that get shouted at and sprayed too? He\u2019s being ridiculous and childish and clearly just can\u2019t be bothered to introduce them slowly and help ease the dogs anxiety because it sounds too much hassle, better to just get rid of all the animals and let the dog carry on.", "LMAO, of course you're not compatible.. Start looking for a new place to live.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf the animals are not being aggressive toward each other they will likely get used to each other. (Maybe give the dog treats when the cat is around or something to associate cat with positive) I have had cats and dogs in the same home that did not love each other right away. It got better eventually.\n\nMaybe Ben wasn\u2019t really ready for you to move in and that is why he is so upset.\n\nI think David saying if you move out the relationship is over is too extreme considering they want you to lock up your cats in a room or rehome them.", "NTA -  like you said, your cats aren't actively trying to scare Zoro.  He's just never been socialized around cats.  How is he with other dogs on walks and such?\n\nMaybe try feeding them all together at the same time?  Is Zoro food motivated?  Maybe have a training/treat session where he and Ump are near each other?", "I couldn't get past all the cutesy pet stuff, sorry.", "NTA. The options they suggested are not fair to the cats. Locking them in one room for the rest of their lives is a pretty insane solution. How would they feel if you suggested Zoro just lives the rest of his life in one room? I don't think they'd go for that at all, because it's equally ridiculous.\n\nThe water bottles and stuff is also not how you train a cat. They are not like dogs and may not associate their behavior with the negative reinforcement, so it's pointless all around. You'd be spraying water on your cats which is unpleasant, and they may not have any clue why you're doing it so nothing is being learned. \n\nI think all the pets probably just need time. No one is being aggressive at this point, so I think it's best to give them more time to adjust on their own and over time. When introducing cats, you usually feed them near each other to teach them a positive association. Maybe to help Zoro realize the cats are not a threat, you could feed them this way. Start with their bowls at a distance where they can still see each other but are comfortable, and move them closer each meal as long as everyone remains comfortable. \n\nDon't try to force the cats on Zoro though. If he's scared and feels cornered, he might react with aggression and he's much bigger than the cats. I think having a safe area where Zoro can go when he wants to retreat from the cats is a good idea too.", "NTA but there are two different perspectives here. Get a vet behaviorist to chime in with neutral expert advice of a path forward. That way neither of you is ignoring the others' concerns about your animals' welfare. They aren't cheap. May be $150 to $300, but for the peace of mind, and in light of the drastic nature of other solutions proposed, may be the best money spent.", "I wonder, without judging, what would you do if it was the reverse.

She didn't tell the kid and the dog to move out.  Some would.", "Yeah I agree it is a problem and they do need to find a solution, but I dont think the answer is locking any of the animals in one room permanently or scaring the cats to train them. Its really the dogs fear that must be helped- they probably need some kind of trainer or to research it themselves.
