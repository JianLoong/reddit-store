I\u2019ve only been moved in for about 3 weeks now. This is the first real friction I\u2019ve had with either of them.\n\nThe issue is that Ben has a very sweet, shy dog, Zoro (~75lb GSD mix) and I have 2 cats (a youngish friendly orange named Ump and my old lady calico, Daisy). Ump has decided he loves the dog and would like to be his BFF immediately and unfortunately, it turns out poor Zoro is terrified of the cats. We did do slow introductions at first but we took Zoro\u2019s avoidance of the initial cat room/doors/gates as disinterest so we thought it would be fine to let them mingle and then we saw what was really happening. \n  \nDaisy seems pleased with Zoro\u2019s fear of her, to be honest.. she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to bother him; she\u2019s 16 & uninterested but she certainly liked how fast he would get out of her way. You can see it in her lil sashay. But she ignores him otherwise. \n\nSweet Ump tried to approach him twice with happy tail and head bumps and Zoro booked it out of the room in terror. We scaled back the introductions again and set up a tall gate on the landing to keep them all separated on different floors for now.\n\nIn my mind, there\u2019s no problems here. Zoro is afraid, yes but neither Ump nor Daisy is being aggressive or antagonistic towards him. We just need to go more slowly and give him time to adjust to an entirely new type of creature and he\u2019ll be okay. In fact, I\u2019m positive once he realizes Ump is soft, warm & safe, he\u2019ll want to cuddle too. But everything will be fine soon; no one needs to be punished or corrected here. No one did anything wrong. It\u2019s a just matter of patience \n\nBen is upset that Zoro is upset and David is upset that Ben is upset.

I\u2019m definitely not giving away my cat for being too friendly. David got really upset when I said I\u2019d move out and said it would be choosing my cats over him & his son which would be the end of our relationship. which I don\u2019t want but I\u2019m not going to appease such an over the top reaction & I\u2019m disappointed in how he\u2019s handling this.\n\nAm I the asshole?

Having a new woman and her two cats suddenly move into your home as a thirteen year old boy is going to take some time to get used to. It'll take a bit to get comfortable with the new dynamics. Of course a thirteen year old boy is going to be upset if it was always just them chilling and now his dog is stressed and he has to share his dad too. It's understandable too that Dad doesn't want to see his son upset over something that is being caused by him and his relationship.\n\nAt the same time, you and the cats were invited to move in and them being animals need to be given some grace and have an adjustment period so that the animals can get used to the new dynamics as well. It doesn't sound like anyone has done anything wrong, maybe an open and honest family meeting may be helpful though.", "NAH - Both you and David overreacted here but I don't think that makes you an asshole. You should have given them space to calm down and then talked to David alone about how animals can take around 3 months to adjust to one another and new environments. David could then go talk to Ben.

If that's the case, David deserves an apology. Should've chosen your words kindly, so a little bit of an AH move.\n\nHowever, regarding the pets, they are a part of the family. David wouldn't \"discipline\" Ben by locking him in a room and spraying/making loud noises. He shouldn't be okay with doing that to your cats.

He's just never been socialized around cats.  How is he with other dogs on walks and such?\n\nMaybe try feeding them all together at the same time?  Is Zoro food motivated?  Maybe have a training/treat session where he and Ump are near each other?", "I couldn't get past all the cutesy pet stuff, sorry.", "NTA. The options they suggested are not fair to the cats. Locking them in one room for the rest of their lives is a pretty insane solution. How would they feel if you suggested Zoro just lives the rest of his life in one room? I don't think they'd go for that at all, because it's equally ridiculous.\n\nThe water bottles and stuff is also not how you train a cat. They are not like dogs and may not associate their behavior with the negative reinforcement, so it's pointless all around. You'd be spraying water on your cats which is unpleasant, and they may not have any clue why you're doing it so nothing is being learned. \n\nI think all the pets probably just need time. No one is being aggressive at this point, so I think it's best to give them more time to adjust on their own and over time. When introducing cats, you usually feed them near each other to teach them a positive association. Maybe to help Zoro realize the cats are not a threat, you could feed them this way. Start with their bowls at a distance where they can still see each other but are comfortable, and move them closer each meal as long as everyone remains comfortable. \n\nDon't try to force the cats on Zoro though. If he's scared and feels cornered, he might react with aggression and he's much bigger than the cats. I think having a safe area where Zoro can go when he wants to retreat from the cats is a good idea too.", "NTA but there are two different perspectives here.

He's obviously unfamiliar with cats, and it doesn't matter to HIM that the cat isn't aggressive, he THINKS it is. That defensiveness could be really bad for both him and the cat, so it's important to get some professional best advice for fostering a good relationship. \n\nIt's also important that you'd end the message the young man's concerns matter to you.

I don't judge people who make the terribly hard decision to give up a pet, but it's not a decision I'd make.  \n\nMy pup relies on me for everything.  For food, for entertainment, for love, for comfort, for vet care, for general care.  She does not know a life without me, I can't imagine giving her up to feel entirely scared and abandoned.  When I leave for work everyday, she sleeps at the door waiting for me to return, I cannot imagine how she'd be if I dropped her off somewhere and never returned. \n\nAgain, I do not judge others who make that terribly hard and overwhelming decision, but I've made mine and my dog is staying with me regardless of the consequences it may have on my life (it's had no consequences other than good ones so far).", "Anytime I see a man like \u201cyou\u2019re choosing xxx over Me\u201d I treat it as a red flag. Sometimes black and white choices have to be made in relationships.

It rather indicates an insecurity that demands to be chosen over even very dear things (friends, pets, family members, etc) or the whole relationship is made unsafe or ended. \n\nOp - NTA - hopefully they chill out and figure out that animals just take awhile to get to know each other.

However, Zoro is going to get bigger as will his aversion to her cats. That's going to lead to a bad situation and could end with the cats being hurt. He's going to realize as he grows that he's bigger than they are and would quite possibly start batting them around the house. What you have to do is decide what's more.important; your cats or your relationship. That's not an easy choice to make.", "NTA, they are overreacting. The dog will be fine, and like you said, you just needed to slow things down.

Your bf needs to actually think for himself and realize that just because his son is upset, doesn\u2019t mean he needs to throw all logic out the window.

You are doing everything right.  Some dogs are afraid of cats but can still live peacefully with them.  My parents had cats and dogs together (still do) for decades now and there have never been major issues.  Sometimes the cats and dogs become friends, sometimes they avoid each other.  The dogs that have been scared of the cats still live happy, healthy lives.  They just make an effort to stay away from the cats, it\u2019s really no big deal.  The only reason I could see to always keep them separate is if aggression occurred between any of the animals but that does not appear to be the case here.", "Agreed. Dog/cat relationships take TIME. Hell cat/cat relationships and even human/cat relationships take time. \n\nI have the opposite problem where dog wants to play and cat wants to be left alone, it took 6 months for us all to work out the relationship between my cat and dog.

It just took time.", "I'd be worried that they'd try to 'rehome' the cats sometime when you weren't home.", "I came here to say this.

That's awful. Any pet owner would be upset about that.\n\nOP, get a proper trainer involved to assess the situation because that dog isn't having fun.

The context of her moving in and distressing the child and his pet is important. She shouldn't just dismiss their fears out of hand. She needs to empathize that this is a big transition for Ben and Zoro. It's imperative that Ben feels like his home is a safe place.\n\nIt also sucks that she's so sure the dog will love the cat eventually.

I am worried about the whole locking them in a room permanently thing- doesnt seem feasible and seems cruel, but I also feel really bad for the dog. I think they all messed up by not introducing the animals properly in a nuetral place with positive emotions and actions. I do think it is the dogs fear that mainly needs to be addressed as thats whats causing issues for all the animals- the dog needs to be desensitized, hopefully its younger or it may be very difficult and possibly not even worth it as old dogs have a much harder time learning and it would be very stressful for him.", "I honestly don\u2019t get why you\u2019re dismissing the feelings of the 13 yo.
