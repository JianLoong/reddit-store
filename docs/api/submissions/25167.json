I\u2019ve only been moved in for about 3 weeks now. This is the first real friction I\u2019ve had with either of them.\n\nThe issue is that Ben has a very sweet, shy dog, Zoro (~75lb GSD mix) and I have 2 cats (a youngish friendly orange named Ump and my old lady calico, Daisy). Ump has decided he loves the dog and would like to be his BFF immediately and unfortunately, it turns out poor Zoro is terrified of the cats. We did do slow introductions at first but we took Zoro\u2019s avoidance of the initial cat room/doors/gates as disinterest so we thought it would be fine to let them mingle and then we saw what was really happening. \n  \nDaisy seems pleased with Zoro\u2019s fear of her, to be honest.. she doesn\u2019t go out of her way to bother him; she\u2019s 16 & uninterested but she certainly liked how fast he would get out of her way. You can see it in her lil sashay. But she ignores him otherwise. \n\nSweet Ump tried to approach him twice with happy tail and head bumps and Zoro booked it out of the room in terror. We scaled back the introductions again and set up a tall gate on the landing to keep them all separated on different floors for now.\n\nIn my mind, there\u2019s no problems here. Zoro is afraid, yes but neither Ump nor Daisy is being aggressive or antagonistic towards him. We just need to go more slowly and give him time to adjust to an entirely new type of creature and he\u2019ll be okay. In fact, I\u2019m positive once he realizes Ump is soft, warm & safe, he\u2019ll want to cuddle too. But everything will be fine soon; no one needs to be punished or corrected here. No one did anything wrong. It\u2019s a just matter of patience \n\nBen is upset that Zoro is upset and David is upset that Ben is upset.

I\u2019m definitely not giving away my cat for being too friendly. David got really upset when I said I\u2019d move out and said it would be choosing my cats over him & his son which would be the end of our relationship. which I don\u2019t want but I\u2019m not going to appease such an over the top reaction & I\u2019m disappointed in how he\u2019s handling this.\n\nAm I the asshole?

Having a new woman and her two cats suddenly move into your home as a thirteen year old boy is going to take some time to get used to. It'll take a bit to get comfortable with the new dynamics. Of course a thirteen year old boy is going to be upset if it was always just them chilling and now his dog is stressed and he has to share his dad too. It's understandable too that Dad doesn't want to see his son upset over something that is being caused by him and his relationship.\n\nAt the same time, you and the cats were invited to move in and them being animals need to be given some grace and have an adjustment period so that the animals can get used to the new dynamics as well. It doesn't sound like anyone has done anything wrong, maybe an open and honest family meeting may be helpful though.", "NAH - Both you and David overreacted here but I don't think that makes you an asshole. You should have given them space to calm down and then talked to David alone about how animals can take around 3 months to adjust to one another and new environments. David could then go talk to Ben.

If that's the case, David deserves an apology. Should've chosen your words kindly, so a little bit of an AH move.\n\nHowever, regarding the pets, they are a part of the family. David wouldn't \"discipline\" Ben by locking him in a room and spraying/making loud noises. He shouldn't be okay with doing that to your cats.

He's just never been socialized around cats.  How is he with other dogs on walks and such?\n\nMaybe try feeding them all together at the same time?  Is Zoro food motivated?  Maybe have a training/treat session where he and Ump are near each other?", "I couldn't get past all the cutesy pet stuff, sorry.", "NTA. The options they suggested are not fair to the cats. Locking them in one room for the rest of their lives is a pretty insane solution. How would they feel if you suggested Zoro just lives the rest of his life in one room? I don't think they'd go for that at all, because it's equally ridiculous.\n\nThe water bottles and stuff is also not how you train a cat. They are not like dogs and may not associate their behavior with the negative reinforcement, so it's pointless all around. You'd be spraying water on your cats which is unpleasant, and they may not have any clue why you're doing it so nothing is being learned. \n\nI think all the pets probably just need time. No one is being aggressive at this point, so I think it's best to give them more time to adjust on their own and over time. When introducing cats, you usually feed them near each other to teach them a positive association. Maybe to help Zoro realize the cats are not a threat, you could feed them this way. Start with their bowls at a distance where they can still see each other but are comfortable, and move them closer each meal as long as everyone remains comfortable. \n\nDon't try to force the cats on Zoro though. If he's scared and feels cornered, he might react with aggression and he's much bigger than the cats. I think having a safe area where Zoro can go when he wants to retreat from the cats is a good idea too.", "NTA but there are two different perspectives here.

He's obviously unfamiliar with cats, and it doesn't matter to HIM that the cat isn't aggressive, he THINKS it is. That defensiveness could be really bad for both him and the cat, so it's important to get some professional best advice for fostering a good relationship. \n\nIt's also important that you'd end the message the young man's concerns matter to you.

The cat who sobbed while she ate is also named Bella! She\u2019s a bit too smart, though. She gave up on learning how to open doors because we started locking them when we would see the doorknob start to jiggle, but then yesterday she started to try again and so we might need to start baby proofing our doorknobs.\n\nI would absolutely pick my cats over a human any day. In every relationship I\u2019ve been in I have made it very clear very early on that if it was between my partner or my animals, I pick my animals. And if that person has a problem with it, we aren\u2019t compatible to begin with because I don\u2019t want to be with someone who thinks animals are just things you can get rid of.\n\nAnd, yeah, cats are *very* good at communicating how they feel about you.", "Oh yes, same. It took about a week for my two cats to get comfortable with each other back in the day, but that was a stressful week when my husband (boyfriend at the time) and I legit thought we had fucked up by adopting two cats and that we\u2019d have to give one back. They enjoyed almost a solid decade of friendship after that.", "Sounds like it! Lol! We trained her in the beginning by slowly letting her get closer to them but making her lay down. Now she will spin like three times, bark, then slam her paws down with her butt up with a stupid happy face. She then realizes they are upset so she backs up a few feet and lays down with a depressed look \ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019m not sure how everyone is missing this but it\u2019s not about dogs & cats. Ben doesn\u2019t love what\u2019s happening here... so get rid of the cats makes sense for a 13 yo.... Or perhaps it\u2019s actually get rid of OP & her cats.", "Spammy bot", "He\u2019s our first human baby and planned only, so can\u2019t say, but feel free to report back with findings", "That\u2019s how you get a golden child.", "I think our cat\u2019s biggest issue was that she felt abandoned when we went to the hospital, to be honest. She\u2019s a rescue and very attached to me, and suddenly I dashed out in the middle of the night and came back a few days later smelling weird and moving weird and holding this yelling bundle. I wish we had made more plans for her, like we live with my MIL, so she was never home alone, but she didn\u2019t feel comfortable coming downstairs. If I could do it over I\u2019d ask MIL to come upstairs and visit with her, maybe pet her and watch some tv with her or something, and even FaceTime with us.", "I wish you all the best... Zoro & the cats will be fine. The animals will figure out their own stuff. It\u2019s Ben that needs some patience from the adults.\n\neta \u2014 we have 4 kids & a house full of dogs & animals the kids just randomly bring home ... I understand it\u2019s not an easy ask to be patient with teenagers!", "Amd yet when OP said she would move out, you said \u201cthat\u2019s a huge over reaction\u201d", "Tell me you haven\u2019t read the post without saying you haven\u2019t read the post. That\u2019s entirely what it\u2019s about!", "A large % of AITA commenters just come here to \"hear themselves talk\" (I guess \"read themselves type\" isn't really an idiom) and will find any way to do so. The classic is \"You're not TA for the situation described in your post, but you *would* be TA in this tangentially related scenario that was never even remotely implied by anything you wrote.\"", "Where did I miss the part that anyone is concerned about Ben?"]}
