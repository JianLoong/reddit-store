{"id": 14419, "submission_id": "12h473t", "title": "AITA for not detailing my rules to my sister involving her undisciplined kids", "selftext": "I (44) have a sister (39) who has two kids (8M and 10M).  I have four kids and as you can imagine, my hands and time are full. My wife and I try to do our best, keeping our parenting skills in line with strict guidelines and understandable consequences. we put a lot of work into this and are quite happy with how our kids treat others and treat us. Most importantly, we have our own set of rules and parenting style that took years for our kids to learn and obey. I feel quite comfortable knowing what I can and can't trust them with.\n\nMy sister and her husband, however, run a different \"parenting style\". You probably know the style I'm about to describe. Phrases like \"boys will be boys\" and \"oh they're just kids\" gets blurted out every time we notice their behavioral problems followed by their minimal attempt at discipline. We both came from pretty strict parents so it's quite strange to observe, but honestly, that's her life decision, not ours.\n\nHowever, when they come to our home, I have to constantly keep an extra eye out for what her two children are doing at almost every minute. If not, I'll catch them breaking any of the rules I've set for them. As you can imagine, they lack the responsibility to ever be left alone.\n\nToday. She and her boys are visiting with us outside. The house is locked, on purpose, except for the side door. I've made it clear to the boys, and my sister, that there is no need to go inside.  Mind you, I sit at a point where I can still see this door. In fact, at one point, I personally catch one of them attempting to go in and had to reiterate the rule. I simply don't want them in there by themselves.  We have bathrooms nearby and all the meal is prepared outside in the yard. It's nice outside as well. As expected, maybe 10 minutes later, as we're talking, on the corner of my eye, I can see the same child of hers, head to the side door. I yell out over the back yard, \"No! Not inside!\" My sister, who was sitting a few feet from me, got up from her chair and approached me asking, \"What's wrong? Why can't they go in? What did they do?\" I responded calmly \"Oh nothing wrong. I just don't want them in there. That's all.\" But that wasn't good enough. She repeated, \"I want to know why they can't go in. What will happen?\" I responded, \"I just don't want them getting into things that I don't want them to mess with.\" She responded, \"Like what? What exactly in the house so I can tell them?\" I looked at her with \"uhhhh....\" She storms off to find her two children and I'm left in the back yard picking up the mess we left on the table.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I wrangle all of my children back to my home, you can tell my sister was crying but trying to hide it as a smile. My wife noticed too. So here's my question, after years of learning the hard way, with both her kids and with her emotions...\n\nAITA for not going into details on why I don't want her kids in there?\n\nUPDATE:  Neighbor was hosting the event.  We share backyard space.

Why would they need to go inside if everything is set up outside and you\u2019ve made clear you don\u2019t want anyone in your house? Your sister is trying to do the opposite of the strict upbringing that you guys had but she\u2019s potentially failing her kids in the process and that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. \n\nBut\n\nYou could have told the truth, that you don't trust them to treat your house and belongings in a respectful manner.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  Remind her of specific past examples where this has shown to be true.  If there are no specific past examples that justify this behaviour then maybe some introspection is needed.\n\nUltimately, NTA for the question asked.  Reflection suggested for the situation as a whole.", "NTA No is a complete sentence. Sounds like your sister needs to learn this lesson so she can pass the information on to her children.", "As a parent, I know it is challenging to deal with people who have very different parenting styles than you do. Let's put it this way, there's a reason that I no longer host kids' birthday parties at my house. I am more than happy to pay for the party package at the bouncy house place and save myself the stress. \n\nThat being said, this is a question of boundaries rather than rules. Kids who are much younger than your sister's are capable of understanding boundaries, and that the boundaries at home are different than the boundaries at school or at someone else's house. The real issue here is that your sister's kids don't respect your boundaries. You remind them of your boundaries, and as soon as you turn around, they're at it again. Their behavior is disrespectful and it's exhausting to deal with. \n\nYour sister doesn't respect your boundaries either. Saying that the kids need to stay with the adults is good enough. You can't be expected to come up with an exhaustive list of everything they can and can't do while unsupervised in your house. It's just not possible and your sister knows it. She just doesn't want to make the effort to deal with her kids. NTA", "NTA I suppose. But it\u2019s weird to be so intense about it.\n\nInstead of screaming No\u2026perhaps walking over and saying \u201cJohn, we\u2019re not going inside today. Do you need something?\u201d\n\nThen go to sister and privately say: Hey can you help me remind the kids we\u2019re not going inside today?\u201d\n\nThen later this week: you can call and say - \u201cCan we talk about something awkward? Remember this weekend when I didn\u2019t want the kids in the house? I\u2019d like to tell you why and ask for your stronger support in the future.\u201d Cue explaining that you don\u2019t trust her kids.", "NTA\n\nAfter years of undisciplined children how can she not know. \n\nIf everything is outside. With a bathroom close by. Why would they need to go inside unless it is to mess around with something?\n\nThe fact that she has to ask makes me wonder why she is so clueless?", "I mean\u2026it is kind of weird to invite people to your home and not allow them inside. What do you mean there were bathrooms \u2018nearby\u2019, do you have a portapotty in your yard or something?", "Since she asks for the reason, just tell her.", "NTA. You\u2019re not only allowed to set boundaries but you don\u2019t have to explain yourself for having them. If you told her why she would have gotten upset. There\u2019s no upside to honesty on this one. Also let\u2019s be real\u2026 she knows why you didn\u2019t want them in your house.", "Nta, its not like others were allowed inside the house during the backyard event. You didn\u2019t allow anyone inside the house. Why would her kid being an exception? It wasnt to use the restroom or because it was too hot outside.", "NTA, the kids should respect the rules; however the fact that you can't explain why a rule is in place suggests that it's just arbitrary, which will make enforcing it with logical consequences problematic.", "Nta", "I feel like I don\u2019t have all the info here. Do they live in the neighborhood? Are they comfortable using the neighbors bathroom? Was it full? Are any of the kids girls and do they menstruate? Because regardless of the past experiences they may have had a legit reason to need to go into the house\u2026 and I think this could have been explained beforehand to just the sister.", "YTA Don't dance around the truth if you're going to be this extra with your sister. Furthermore plan for a public outing if you don't want to let them inside your home, which unless it's made of gold or filled with reachable porcelain, it's rude to keep them locked out. Especially when you can't give them a reasonable excuse.", "You sound insufferable. YTA", "YTA. While you are welcome to have any rules you want, not allowing kids inside of the house is not common. Unless you told these rules to your sister before they came, she has a reason to question the reasons...", "YTA", "YTA. You sound like a high maintenance control freak.", "I am all for this, just not around the kids. This difficult conversation should be done at a different day and time. This could end up being a powerful conversation where you discuss your own upbringing in a strict household. Furthermore, it may affect both of your parenting styles.", "She ASKED him what he wanted her sons to avoid so she could communicate exactly that to the kids. He had NOTHING to say bc he had no good excuse and his sister knew that. So what information exactly was she supposed to pass on?\n\nAH for making up stupid rules and hurting her feelings", "He did tell them that at no point did they need to be inside the house. \n\nThat's all he needed to do.", "He had already told all of the kids not to go in the home. That particular kid had already tried to go in once and was told not to go in the home. How many different times and different ways does it need to be explained to the kid before they should be expected to listen?", "Pool house?\n\nI have a family member with a pool house cabana thing with a restroom right by the pool.  Hopefully it means fewer people pee in the pool.", "It was an outdoor event at a neighboring family home with all amenities provided with shared backyard space.  My home wasn't hosting the event.", "OP cannot explain the rule not because it is arbitrary but because his sister would be upset if he told that her kids are hellions who break other people\u2019s possessions. Mainly because the sister doesn\u2019t parent them properly. That isn\u2019t a conversation to be had at a neighborhood event.", "OP\u2019s sisters kids are boys\ud83e\udee3", "I'm not sure how OP was \"extra\" with his sister. He just didn't answer when she asked why the kids weren't allowed inside. They were at an outside party and there was no reason to into the house. He didn't go off on her in front of everyone about her parenting.", "Did you read the post?\n\nHe DID plan for it. \n\nNeighbor was hosting. Neighbor provided ALL amenities, which includes a bathroom.", "Commonality doesn't matter. \n\nThey are His rules for HIS home. \n\nShe has no right to question them as long as the rules are harmless.", "When its a backyard party unless for bathrooms or too hot outside its normal to not allow anyone inside. No one was inside the house.", "He has a right to say no to someone entering his house. I am not going to go through a 50 item list of everything I can possibly remember I might not want them touching. If the event is outside, why is he required to let them in. Should he have said \"everything. They break or invade everything, so I want them to stay out of everything.\" That might be an AH move.", "He doesnt have to give specific examples or list reasons, it's irrelevant. It's his home, I don't want anyone in the house was the boundary and as a parent, she was supposed to say to her children there is no reason to enter the house so stay outside and play. That's the information she shares.", "She hurt her own feelings. If OP doesn\u2019t want people in their house, then they don\u2019t go in the house. Simple as that. There doesn\u2019t need to be any real reason, especially since there was 0 reason for the kids to actually go inside.", "Found the Sister.", "He told her what he wants them to avoid. The inside of the house. Why is that hard to comprehend?", "I get that. But kids need to be reminded sometimes, especially for things that aren\u2019t normal. I remind my own children of stuff multiple times a day\u2026 \n\nThe reminders aren\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s mom\u2019s refusal to accept the reminder that is.", "I would edit and add this information to your post to avoid any confusion about this detail. I already didn\u2019t think you did anything wrong, but this may be helpful context for others.", "Still kinda weird and inhospitable. I'm gonna say ESH.", "Exactly! It's absurd that she's asking he list the things they can't touch. How about \"anything that isn't theirs?\" But it seems even that might be beyond them..and what if he failed to mention something and they broke that thing. Would she then claim it was fair game because he never told them no specifically? It's a bizarre and combative request.", "Your children already have figured out how to manipulate you, and you don't even see it.", "ok thanks.  trying to observe the 3000 word limit.", "Asking a question is combative now? She was trying to be understanding of his conditions and ppl like you call it bizarre when the rule was bizarre in the first place, you are wild LMAO", "Because it's an absurd question. As I said, any reasonable parent knows the answer should be \"nothing that isn't there,\" not basically setting up loopholes by requesting a list of what exactly they shouldn't touch. I feel bad for kids with parents like that. They aren't told how to interact politely with society and their parents act like it's everyone else's fault for not putting up with them."]}
