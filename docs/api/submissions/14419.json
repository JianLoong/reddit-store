{"id": 14419, "submission_id": "12h473t", "title": "AITA for not detailing my rules to my sister involving her undisciplined kids", "selftext": "I (44) have a sister (39) who has two kids (8M and 10M).  I have four kids and as you can imagine, my hands and time are full. My wife and I try to do our best, keeping our parenting skills in line with strict guidelines and understandable consequences. we put a lot of work into this and are quite happy with how our kids treat others and treat us. Most importantly, we have our own set of rules and parenting style that took years for our kids to learn and obey. I feel quite comfortable knowing what I can and can't trust them with.\n\nMy sister and her husband, however, run a different \"parenting style\". You probably know the style I'm about to describe. Phrases like \"boys will be boys\" and \"oh they're just kids\" gets blurted out every time we notice their behavioral problems followed by their minimal attempt at discipline. We both came from pretty strict parents so it's quite strange to observe, but honestly, that's her life decision, not ours.\n\nHowever, when they come to our home, I have to constantly keep an extra eye out for what her two children are doing at almost every minute. If not, I'll catch them breaking any of the rules I've set for them. As you can imagine, they lack the responsibility to ever be left alone.\n\nToday. She and her boys are visiting with us outside. The house is locked, on purpose, except for the side door. I've made it clear to the boys, and my sister, that there is no need to go inside.  Mind you, I sit at a point where I can still see this door. In fact, at one point, I personally catch one of them attempting to go in and had to reiterate the rule. I simply don't want them in there by themselves.  We have bathrooms nearby and all the meal is prepared outside in the yard. It's nice outside as well. As expected, maybe 10 minutes later, as we're talking, on the corner of my eye, I can see the same child of hers, head to the side door. I yell out over the back yard, \"No! Not inside!\" My sister, who was sitting a few feet from me, got up from her chair and approached me asking, \"What's wrong? Why can't they go in? What did they do?\" I responded calmly \"Oh nothing wrong. I just don't want them in there. That's all.\" But that wasn't good enough. She repeated, \"I want to know why they can't go in. What will happen?\" I responded, \"I just don't want them getting into things that I don't want them to mess with.\" She responded, \"Like what? What exactly in the house so I can tell them?\" I looked at her with \"uhhhh....\" She storms off to find her two children and I'm left in the back yard picking up the mess we left on the table.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I wrangle all of my children back to my home, you can tell my sister was crying but trying to hide it as a smile. My wife noticed too. So here's my question, after years of learning the hard way, with both her kids and with her emotions...\n\nAITA for not going into details on why I don't want her kids in there?\n\nUPDATE:  Neighbor was hosting the event.  We share backyard space.

Why would they need to go inside if everything is set up outside and you\u2019ve made clear you don\u2019t want anyone in your house? Your sister is trying to do the opposite of the strict upbringing that you guys had but she\u2019s potentially failing her kids in the process and that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. \n\nBut\n\nYou could have told the truth, that you don't trust them to treat your house and belongings in a respectful manner.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  Remind her of specific past examples where this has shown to be true.  If there are no specific past examples that justify this behaviour then maybe some introspection is needed.\n\nUltimately, NTA for the question asked.  Reflection suggested for the situation as a whole.", "NTA No is a complete sentence. Sounds like your sister needs to learn this lesson so she can pass the information on to her children.", "As a parent, I know it is challenging to deal with people who have very different parenting styles than you do. Let's put it this way, there's a reason that I no longer host kids' birthday parties at my house. I am more than happy to pay for the party package at the bouncy house place and save myself the stress. \n\nThat being said, this is a question of boundaries rather than rules. Kids who are much younger than your sister's are capable of understanding boundaries, and that the boundaries at home are different than the boundaries at school or at someone else's house. The real issue here is that your sister's kids don't respect your boundaries. You remind them of your boundaries, and as soon as you turn around, they're at it again. Their behavior is disrespectful and it's exhausting to deal with. \n\nYour sister doesn't respect your boundaries either. Saying that the kids need to stay with the adults is good enough. You can't be expected to come up with an exhaustive list of everything they can and can't do while unsupervised in your house. It's just not possible and your sister knows it. She just doesn't want to make the effort to deal with her kids. NTA", "NTA I suppose.

Remember this weekend when I didn\u2019t want the kids in the house?

You didn\u2019t allow anyone inside the house. Why would her kid being an exception? It wasnt to use the restroom or because it was too hot outside.", "NTA, the kids should respect the rules; however the fact that you can't explain why a rule is in place suggests that it's just arbitrary, which will make enforcing it with logical consequences problematic.", "Nta", "I feel like I don\u2019t have all the info here.

It's absurd that she's asking he list the things they can't touch. How about \"anything that isn't theirs?\" But it seems even that might be beyond them..and what if he failed to mention something and they broke that thing.

As I said, any reasonable parent knows the answer should be \"nothing that isn't theirs,\" not basically setting up loopholes by requesting a list of what exactly they shouldn't touch.

Having hosted and visited a lot of large gatherings, you are 100% wise for setting this boundary. Undisciplined or unsupervised children can DESTROY a home!

The ones where you had to go in the house to use the facilities guests were still respectful and only went to the one closest to the backyard door, and *never* stayed in the home or wandered around other than to do their business and then come straight back outside to where the party was.

Could be a million reason as to why the kids wanted to enter. Maybe the kids wanted a break to just watch TV etc. Have a conversation man, with the kids and your sister. Having rules doesn\u2019t absolve you from all communication about them, especially with the people you expect to follow them. They way you guys grew screwed both you and your sister up. You don\u2019t know how to communicate and the sister cries when she\u2019s in a situation that requires communication with an uncooperative participant. Communicating can be hard but it\u2019s a emotional skill that is needed as an adult. Whatever you guys didn\u2019t learn from childhood at this point is on guys now to develop. Right now it\u2019s seems that your sister is willing to try and talk things through including about your rules. But you don\u2019t seem to recognize the importance of communication and skirt around it by just making up authoritative rules that don\u2019t allow for questioning.

We'd expect people to be using the house, especially for the toilet but also if they wanted some space, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

However, I understand it's not that way for you and OP. \n\nJust a couple of random thoughts, though: if the weather is hot, might someone get uncomfortable and want to go inside? If the only toilets are a bit public, might a child want to go somewhere more private? If a kid is being teased by other children, might they want to go somewhere away from the other kids? Or, you know, if an adult says something that upsets or alarms the child, mightn't they want to hide? Quite apart from all that, some people are introverts and find lots of people exhausting. \n\nThose are all innocent reasons why someone, especially a close family member, might have wanted to be in the house.

From my experience, young children are not allowed inside other people's homes without supervision.  Acquaintances are also not given free access to homes when the homeowner is not there. Allowing children and untrusted adults access to private spaces alone is potentially disastrous.\n\nThis is a party hosted by their neighbor. OP has 4 kids of their own to supervise.
