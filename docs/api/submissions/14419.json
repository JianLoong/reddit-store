{"id": 14419, "submission_id": "12h473t", "title": "AITA for not detailing my rules to my sister involving her undisciplined kids", "selftext": "I (44) have a sister (39) who has two kids (8M and 10M).  I have four kids and as you can imagine, my hands and time are full. My wife and I try to do our best, keeping our parenting skills in line with strict guidelines and understandable consequences. we put a lot of work into this and are quite happy with how our kids treat others and treat us. Most importantly, we have our own set of rules and parenting style that took years for our kids to learn and obey. I feel quite comfortable knowing what I can and can't trust them with.\n\nMy sister and her husband, however, run a different \"parenting style\". You probably know the style I'm about to describe. Phrases like \"boys will be boys\" and \"oh they're just kids\" gets blurted out every time we notice their behavioral problems followed by their minimal attempt at discipline. We both came from pretty strict parents so it's quite strange to observe, but honestly, that's her life decision, not ours.\n\nHowever, when they come to our home, I have to constantly keep an extra eye out for what her two children are doing at almost every minute. If not, I'll catch them breaking any of the rules I've set for them. As you can imagine, they lack the responsibility to ever be left alone.\n\nToday. She and her boys are visiting with us outside. The house is locked, on purpose, except for the side door. I've made it clear to the boys, and my sister, that there is no need to go inside.  Mind you, I sit at a point where I can still see this door. In fact, at one point, I personally catch one of them attempting to go in and had to reiterate the rule. I simply don't want them in there by themselves.  We have bathrooms nearby and all the meal is prepared outside in the yard. It's nice outside as well. As expected, maybe 10 minutes later, as we're talking, on the corner of my eye, I can see the same child of hers, head to the side door. I yell out over the back yard, \"No! Not inside!\" My sister, who was sitting a few feet from me, got up from her chair and approached me asking, \"What's wrong? Why can't they go in? What did they do?\" I responded calmly \"Oh nothing wrong. I just don't want them in there. That's all.\" But that wasn't good enough. She repeated, \"I want to know why they can't go in. What will happen?\" I responded, \"I just don't want them getting into things that I don't want them to mess with.\" She responded, \"Like what? What exactly in the house so I can tell them?\" I looked at her with \"uhhhh....\" She storms off to find her two children and I'm left in the back yard picking up the mess we left on the table.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, I wrangle all of my children back to my home, you can tell my sister was crying but trying to hide it as a smile. My wife noticed too. So here's my question, after years of learning the hard way, with both her kids and with her emotions...\n\nAITA for not going into details on why I don't want her kids in there?\n\nUPDATE:  Neighbor was hosting the event.  We share backyard space.

Why would they need to go inside if everything is set up outside and you\u2019ve made clear you don\u2019t want anyone in your house? Your sister is trying to do the opposite of the strict upbringing that you guys had but she\u2019s potentially failing her kids in the process and that\u2019s not your problem.", "NTA. \n\nBut\n\nYou could have told the truth, that you don't trust them to treat your house and belongings in a respectful manner.  Sometimes the truth hurts.  Remind her of specific past examples where this has shown to be true.  If there are no specific past examples that justify this behaviour then maybe some introspection is needed.\n\nUltimately, NTA for the question asked.  Reflection suggested for the situation as a whole.", "NTA No is a complete sentence. Sounds like your sister needs to learn this lesson so she can pass the information on to her children.", "As a parent, I know it is challenging to deal with people who have very different parenting styles than you do. Let's put it this way, there's a reason that I no longer host kids' birthday parties at my house. I am more than happy to pay for the party package at the bouncy house place and save myself the stress. \n\nThat being said, this is a question of boundaries rather than rules. Kids who are much younger than your sister's are capable of understanding boundaries, and that the boundaries at home are different than the boundaries at school or at someone else's house. The real issue here is that your sister's kids don't respect your boundaries. You remind them of your boundaries, and as soon as you turn around, they're at it again. Their behavior is disrespectful and it's exhausting to deal with. \n\nYour sister doesn't respect your boundaries either. Saying that the kids need to stay with the adults is good enough. You can't be expected to come up with an exhaustive list of everything they can and can't do while unsupervised in your house. It's just not possible and your sister knows it. She just doesn't want to make the effort to deal with her kids. NTA", "NTA I suppose.

It's absurd that she's asking he list the things they can't touch. How about \"anything that isn't theirs?\" But it seems even that might be beyond them..and what if he failed to mention something and they broke that thing.

As I said, any reasonable parent knows the answer should be \"nothing that isn't theirs,\" not basically setting up loopholes by requesting a list of what exactly they shouldn't touch.

Having hosted and visited a lot of large gatherings, you are 100% wise for setting this boundary. Undisciplined or unsupervised children can DESTROY a home!

Could be a million reason as to why the kids wanted to enter. Maybe the kids wanted a break to just watch TV etc. Have a conversation man, with the kids and your sister. Having rules doesn\u2019t absolve you from all communication about them, especially with the people you expect to follow them. They way you guys grew screwed both you and your sister up. You don\u2019t know how to communicate and the sister cries when she\u2019s in a situation that requires communication with an uncooperative participant. Communicating can be hard but it\u2019s a emotional skill that is needed as an adult. Whatever you guys didn\u2019t learn from childhood at this point is on guys now to develop. Right now it\u2019s seems that your sister is willing to try and talk things through including about your rules. But you don\u2019t seem to recognize the importance of communication and skirt around it by just making up authoritative rules that don\u2019t allow for questioning.

We'd expect people to be using the house, especially for the toilet but also if they wanted some space, so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

If the only toilets are a bit public, might a child want to go somewhere more private? If a kid is being teased by other children, might they want to go somewhere away from the other kids? Or, you know, if an adult says something that upsets or alarms the child, mightn't they want to hide? Quite apart from all that, some people are introverts and find lots of people exhausting. \n\nThose are all innocent reasons why someone, especially a close family member, might have wanted to be in the house.

From my experience, young children are not allowed inside other people's homes without supervision.  Acquaintances are also not given free access to homes when the homeowner is not there. Allowing children and untrusted adults access to private spaces alone is potentially disastrous.\n\nThis is a party hosted by their neighbor. OP has 4 kids of their own to supervise.

My sister and I strategize about to make family visits go smoothly in a way that accommodates everyone's parenting styles and all the kids' social skills. It's hard but it's the best way to maintain strong, healthy family relationships.", "For real, when I read the bit that\u2019s like \u201cI have to constantly keep an extra eye out for what her two kids are doing at almost every minute. If not, they\u2019ll break almost any rule I\u2019ve set for them. As you can imagine, they lack any responsibility to be left alone\u201d that struck me as quite controlling. I feel like if they\u2019d actually broken any significant rules which resulted in bad things, he\u2019d have said.\n\nCan you imagine being 8 and 10 and not being allowed to leave your uncles sight, not even to play hide and seek with your cousins? For reference, my 6 and 7 year old cousins were playing alone outside this Easter, and the 8 and 10 year olds were all around the house. It\u2019s incredibly boring for kids to stay in the same place as the adults and have to listen to them talk.", "Because op said so is reason enough.", "There IS also the fact that it IS his home and maybe he just doesn't want them in there. That is his choice.", "Im wondering how \"nice\" nice is outside. What's nice for me would be too hot for my brother who then tends to get headaches/migraines. \nContrast to that, What's nice to my brother would be too cold for me if I'm sitting still, that said as a kid i didn't sit still so wouldn't have been an issue back then, but not every kid is active. \nI'm wondering if perhaps the kids tried to find some different, more comfortable temperatures for them.", "Yes, weird isn't it? Really individualistic, like it's normal to not have a bit of communality in what's normal behaviour if you invite friends or family.\nKind of cold also; they're just children and his nephews too.\n\nI guess it works for them, but it still comes across as weird.", "> Most importantly, we have our own set of rules and parenting style that took years for our kids to learn and obey. \n\n> If not, I'll catch them breaking any of the rules I've set for them.\n\nIf you don\u2019t find these sentences concerning, I don\u2019t know what to tell you.\n\nAlso, OP did not say \u201cnatural consequences.\u201d He said \u201cstrict guidelines and understandable consequences.\u201d I hope you see the difference.", "In most situations, yeah, I agree. But it's frustrating and confusing to kids when adults just say \"because I say so\" and not give a reason", "The kid had already tried to sneak inside once\n\nOP went \"no one needs to go inside\"  \nStopped this kid once already  \nAnd *then* yelled \"no\" when the kid wouldn't listen the (minimum) third time", "She and her children were told at the beginning of the event not to go in the house. If she wanted clarification as to why, she and her  were not allowed to go into the house, she should have, and could have asked when told at the beginning. She wasn\u2019t shocked she was pushing back of being told no", "I don't think so.", "My aunt has a set up like this, she's got a pool in the backyard and had a bathroom set up downstairs that the backdoor opens into. Bathroom so you don't track mud upstairs and a shower so you can rinse chlorine off before sitting on furniture.", "Just because a child isn\u2019t receiving discipline on a regular basis, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t capable of being disciplined. Same goes for education/explanation. They might even be more receptive to something so novel to them. I teach and regularly encounter kids who are basically ignored at home, and many thrive and behave differently in a structured environment with people who engage them.", "Wtf does twinker twinker mean \ud83d\ude02 Do you mean \u201cwink, wink\u201d?", "and that\u2019s fine in those situations. in the cases where i have laid down rules in my home regarding other people\u2019s children that believe \u201cboys will be boys\u201d, they have taken offense to it. parents with that mentality tend to victimize themselves when called out. op\u2019s sister did it when she started crying about it", "I do not agree at all that explaining the rule is \u201cparenting\u201d. And while OP has no obligation to explain, this isn\u2019t about wether they have an obligation. It\u2019s wether it makes them the AH to enforce the rule with no explanation about it. The sister wanted specifics and OP could have at least said \u201cit\u2019s not about something specific, I just don\u2019t want the kids inside alone\u201d lol\n\nIdk I think a lot of this is communication problems but if OP isn\u2019t gonna give more context I\u2019m not giving a judgement, though I am leaning more towards OP being the A H", "common sense would tell her that he obviously doesn\u2019t want them in there. its his house. he doesn\u2019t need to explain that he doesn\u2019t want anyone in his house.", "Where are you getting OP screamed for their life? The post says they were sitting with the door within view and they yelled for him not to go in. Yelling might have been the only way to be sure the kid even heard what they were saying if they were a distance away and the kid wasn't paying attention to anything other than getting in the house.", "Communication is key. Again, it\u2019s not about who is \u201cright\u201d it\u2019s about who is the \u201casshole\u201d. I don\u2019t like letting my little cousins inside my house but if they stop by and I want them to stay outside, I will say \u201cSorry guys, I just don\u2019t want anyone in there by themselves\u201d not scream \u201cNo! Not inside!\u201d and refuse to elaborate lol", "If OP can't stand the sister's kids, then why invite them in the first place?", "that\u2019s reasonable if it were the first time. Sounds like it\u2019s been happening for a while.", "because he\u2019d probably be fine with them if they were outside like he asked them to lol my nephews are annoying, but they are fine when we are at their house or outside somewhere else. Only bothers me when they are in my house breaking my things. Imagine trying to discipline someone else\u2019s child in their own home."]}
