I think you failed to see that her effort was likely for her to feel closer to you and your family. You're only seeing it from your perspective. I think you should listen to her reasons. It's also not your perogative to tell her she can't try to learn a language that is connected with your culture. I think you both need to discuss it and get to the root of things.", "NAH. You get to have your feelings and viewpoints on your parents' native language. But I think you missed the intention of what your gf was trying to do. She sees a future with you, dude. She may be thinking she wants to show your family she respects their background, or she may be thinking if you reach the stage of having children, she can help you pass down the language. I realize you're pretty young and that kind of thing may not be on your radar yet (or ever) and that's totally okay if it's not. But I think when you came at your gf with this \"why are you giving me a gift I don't want\" response, she may have felt rejected on a larger level. \n\nThis isn't an \"asshole\" issue, in my opinion, it's a \"sit down and communicate about your relationship\" issue.", "NAH. She probably wants to do something to feel like she's connecting with your family. You are giving the logical argument that it would be a lot of unnecessary work for her. She may be upset because she could be interpreting what you said as \"why bother, we're not likely to stay together anyway.\" Sometimes people read more into these things than what was meant.", "I work with kids from immigrant families and get the dubious honor of watching heritage language loss in action. It makes me sad and frustrated but, aside from supporting families in speaking their native languages at home and loudly dispelling misinformation about dual language learners, there\u2019s not much I can do. \n\nIdk, I think your rejection of her efforts is weird.

Whilst you are allowed to your position, you didn't have to enforce it so strongly. She's also likely telling you she would appreciate it if you learnt Dutch.", "NTA !! I am so confused by the non-NTA votes here, especially the ones claiming that you were angry or controlling or hiding something in your language, since nowhere in your post was that indicated. As an Indian, I completely get it. You just let her know that she should learn it if she really wants to, not just because of you. I was born and brought up outside India (now living in India), and even I don't speak any language except English. I think there was nothing wrong with your reaction. There are plenty of other ways for you two to connect, some of which were mentioned by other commenters. Her \"you should be grateful\" response is bizarre and condescending.", "NTA.\n\nI can somewhat relate as I'm half-French, half-Mauritian, and while I do understand Mauritian cr\u00e9ole, I've never spoken it a lot since my parents spoke only French at home when I was younger.\nMy husband's understands a bit of it, but it's more because he hears my family speak it than because of me.\n\nIf she wants to learn the language to feel more included when your family drops into their navite language, it's her right and rather normal - and only learning oral comprehension is far easier than getting into writing and reading.\nSo your reaction to offer to teach her some sentences in your native language was clearly the more logical in this situation.\n\nThe fact she got upset about it is honestly a bit strange, but maybe she felt you didn't appreciate her efforts in trying to share something from your own culture with you.\nYou could maybe find something else that's culturally yours and more important to share with her? Watching films with subtitles, cooking, whatever interests you and you'd actually enjoy sharing with her?\n(My husband and I regularly look up bits about Mauritian History and things like this because this is something we enjoy and of we both love Mauritian cuisine)\n\nAnd of course reciprocate about her own culture, she maybe wanting to share more with you but hadn't managed to convey it to you.\n\nGood luck!", "Nta.

Learning a new language is never a waste of time. Just because you stopped putting in the effort to be able to read and write it, doesn\u2019t mean its worthless. Just knowing another language looks great on your resume. And no you didn\u2019t ask her but she loves you and is interested in your culture.

If she's solely doing it for your benefit then it does feel like a slight waste of time, since it sounds like you almost exclusively speak English. I think encouraging her to learn some simple phrases is a good idea.", "NAH I understand where you both are coming from but I think she sees it as way of integrating more with your family. I know they all speak English but she probably thinks it would impress them if she learned their native language.\n\nI think to her, it's a sign that she's there for the long haul and your reaction makes it seem like she doesn't need to bother because she may not be around forever.", "YTA.  Sounds like you lost your only means of hiding communications from your girlfriend in plain sight.  Communication is the cornerstone of any good relationship\u2026 why would you get in the way of that?\n\nEven the most charitable interpretations of your hesitance would lead reasonable people to think something is rotten in Denmark here\u2026", "NTA.  I\u2019m puzzled by the you should be grateful comment.  She should get a \u2018prize\u2019 for doing something you didn\u2019t ask for?!   If she wants to learn great but her reaction to your unenthusiastic response is cringey.

Although I will say I just don\u2019t see my native language as important in my life so I think that plays a big role in it", "It definitely can, if the skill isn\u2019t something that you enjoy or will use. For example, if I learned to play the piano, learning that would be a waste of time for me because I\u2019d neither enjoy it nor use it.", "Honestly I didn\u2019t give that much thought to the statement. I was using white to mean \u2018white American\u2019 and qualifying that by saying she\u2019s part Dutch as well", "Exactly, the other half is American. I didn\u2019t think that would be so hard to understand.", "> it's really not that serious actually\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t it be? Don\u2019t you think my girlfriend would be upset if she spent years learning a language only for me to tell her I\u2019d rather speak in English anyways?", "No, we just all prefer English since even my parents and their siblings did their schooling in English. But I can see how it would come off that way", "A good idea. I think if she\u2019d want me to learn Dutch it would be more for personal reasons than practical ones though", "You might also consider learning Dutch - I'm sure she'd appreciated it and so would her mother", "Surprise her with some bitterballen \ud83d\ude1c", "I really think you should rethink this. A lot of children of immigrants feel like they were robbed of a chance at connection with their culture and extended families because their parents didn't teach them the native language.", "Any opportunity to give a child a language, any language, is an advantage for them. It\u2019s a free gift.", "Yeah, this whole thread is weird like that and I don\u2019t know why", "You can't stop her. If you think you can control her or that it's appropriate to try to, you need to break up with her and never date again.", "That's fair. In that case, she might want you to learn about her culture. Maybe look up a few phrases in Dutch.", "Then you wouldn\u2019t be willing to put in the effort in the first place. I am saying that it doesn\u2019t matter what your motive is, as long as you have the necessary motivation its not a waste. And you claiming it is, is so incredibly rude", "That is fair, but white doesn\u2019t automatically mean white American, hence why the clarification is needed. Dutch people are white too lol.", "i'm tempted to change my answer to YTA. not a fan of your mindset at all. she obviously wants to do it and is willing to put in that effort so let her! who cares if she won't actively be using the language in the future? learning languages is fun! not everything has to be so serious and practical", "Her dad\u2019s the Dutch one, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he didn\u2019t care since he willingly immigrated for no other reason than preferring the US. But possibly.", "Will do", "I agree, which is why I\u2019ll teach my kids the useful languages I know", "Didn\u2019t say I could. I was just saying that in my opinion if she wanted to learn it for my sake it would be a waste", "Thanks for the suggestion", "> as long as you have the necessary motivation its not a waste\n\nThat\u2019s the point I\u2019m making here. If her motivation is assuming that we\u2019ll speak in my native language, which isn\u2019t true, then that\u2019s not a goal that will be achieved and will only lead to disappointment.", "Yeah, of course, I was just being sort of flippant with my word usage lol", "I\u2019m not saying it has to be serious and practical. I\u2019m saying *if* she wants to learn it for practical purposes, like speaking to me, then she shouldn\u2019t, but if she wants to learn it for the sake of learning a language, then she should go ahead with it.", "\u201cMy girlfriends white, but Dutch on her moms side.\u201d \n\nWhich is it, my dude?", "It sounds from what you\u2019re saying here that you only see value in learning a new skill if it has some direct and practical application in your life. Does that sound fair?\n\nIf so, it may be good to know that some people (maybe your girlfriend is one of them) enjoy learning new things purely for the sake of learning - even if it\u2019s a skill they\u2019ll never have any practical use for. Maybe your girlfriend sees this as simply a good excuse to take a shot at learning a new language, with the added bonus that it has a personal connection - like, if she likes learning languages, maybe if she hadn\u2019t met you\u2019d she\u2019d have had a go at learning Mandarin, rather than Urdu (I don\u2019t know what language is in question here, just picking one at random!).", "See edit", "> It sounds from what you\u2019re saying here that you only see value in learning a new skill if it has some direct and practical application in your life. Does that sound fair\n\nNot necessarily. I\u2019m saying she *could* be learning it for the perceived practical purpose of speaking to me and my family, or also could be wanting to learn it for it\u2019s own sake because she\u2019s interested. If her motive is the former then I\u2019d say she shouldn\u2019t spend her time on it, because there is no practical purpose. If it\u2019s the latter, then I don\u2019t see why she shouldn\u2019t", "Did you ask her about what she hoped to get out of it before dismissing her plans and making her sad?", "Yes, she said she wanted to speak to me in my native language, so I made it clear I\u2019d rather speak in English regardless"]}
