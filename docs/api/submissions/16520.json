I think you failed to see that her effort was likely for her to feel closer to you and your family. You're only seeing it from your perspective. I think you should listen to her reasons. It's also not your perogative to tell her she can't try to learn a language that is connected with your culture. I think you both need to discuss it and get to the root of things.", "NAH. You get to have your feelings and viewpoints on your parents' native language. But I think you missed the intention of what your gf was trying to do. She sees a future with you, dude. She may be thinking she wants to show your family she respects their background, or she may be thinking if you reach the stage of having children, she can help you pass down the language. I realize you're pretty young and that kind of thing may not be on your radar yet (or ever) and that's totally okay if it's not. But I think when you came at your gf with this \"why are you giving me a gift I don't want\" response, she may have felt rejected on a larger level. \n\nThis isn't an \"asshole\" issue, in my opinion, it's a \"sit down and communicate about your relationship\" issue.", "NAH. She probably wants to do something to feel like she's connecting with your family. You are giving the logical argument that it would be a lot of unnecessary work for her. She may be upset because she could be interpreting what you said as \"why bother, we're not likely to stay together anyway.\" Sometimes people read more into these things than what was meant.", "I work with kids from immigrant families and get the dubious honor of watching heritage language loss in action. It makes me sad and frustrated but, aside from supporting families in speaking their native languages at home and loudly dispelling misinformation about dual language learners, there\u2019s not much I can do. \n\nIdk, I think your rejection of her efforts is weird.

Whilst you are allowed to your position, you didn't have to enforce it so strongly. She's also likely telling you she would appreciate it if you learnt Dutch.", "NTA !! I am so confused by the non-NTA votes here, especially the ones claiming that you were angry or controlling or hiding something in your language, since nowhere in your post was that indicated. As an Indian, I completely get it. You just let her know that she should learn it if she really wants to, not just because of you. I was born and brought up outside India (now living in India), and even I don't speak any language except English. I think there was nothing wrong with your reaction. There are plenty of other ways for you two to connect, some of which were mentioned by other commenters. Her \"you should be grateful\" response is bizarre and condescending.", "NTA.\n\nI can somewhat relate as I'm half-French, half-Mauritian, and while I do understand Mauritian cr\u00e9ole, I've never spoken it a lot since my parents spoke only French at home when I was younger.\nMy husband's understands a bit of it, but it's more because he hears my family speak it than because of me.\n\nIf she wants to learn the language to feel more included when your family drops into their navite language, it's her right and rather normal - and only learning oral comprehension is far easier than getting into writing and reading.\nSo your reaction to offer to teach her some sentences in your native language was clearly the more logical in this situation.\n\nThe fact she got upset about it is honestly a bit strange, but maybe she felt you didn't appreciate her efforts in trying to share something from your own culture with you.\nYou could maybe find something else that's culturally yours and more important to share with her? Watching films with subtitles, cooking, whatever interests you and you'd actually enjoy sharing with her?\n(My husband and I regularly look up bits about Mauritian History and things like this because this is something we enjoy and of we both love Mauritian cuisine)\n\nAnd of course reciprocate about her own culture, she maybe wanting to share more with you but hadn't managed to convey it to you.\n\nGood luck!", "Nta.

Learning a new language is never a waste of time. Just because you stopped putting in the effort to be able to read and write it, doesn\u2019t mean its worthless. Just knowing another language looks great on your resume. And no you didn\u2019t ask her but she loves you and is interested in your culture.

But half Dutch on her moms side\".", "NTA but i'm also having a really hard time understanding your reaction. it's an extremely sweet and harmless gesture, and she wouldn't be going through all this effort if she didn't WANT to. it sounds to me like you feel disconnected from your own culture but why does that mean she can't show any interest in it?", "NTA. If she's solely doing it for your benefit then it does feel like a slight waste of time, since it sounds like you almost exclusively speak English. I think encouraging her to learn some simple phrases is a good idea.", "NAH I understand where you both are coming from but I think she sees it as way of integrating more with your family. I know they all speak English but she probably thinks it would impress them if she learned their native language.\n\nI think to her, it's a sign that she's there for the long haul and your reaction makes it seem like she doesn't need to bother because she may not be around forever.", "YTA.  Sounds like you lost your only means of hiding communications from your girlfriend in plain sight.  Communication is the cornerstone of any good relationship\u2026 why would you get in the way of that?\n\nEven the most charitable interpretations of your hesitance would lead reasonable people to think something is rotten in Denmark here\u2026", "NTA.  I\u2019m puzzled by the you should be grateful comment.  She should get a \u2018prize\u2019 for doing something you didn\u2019t ask for?!   If she wants to learn great but her reaction to your unenthusiastic response is cringey.

I honestly would maybe have a talk with her about other things you both can share together that would be more meaningful to you both. I feel like she was just trying to deepen the emotional intimacy in your relationship and was misguided with thinking learning your language was the way to do that. \n\nI would also maybe apologize for shutting her down like that.

You may not see the advantage of speaking the other language. You have said your language isn't useful. Which is just kind of a sad opinion to have considering the people who speak it every day definitely have use for it. \n\nYour gf wanted to share something with you, and you just came across in your comments as looking down on her for \"wasting time\" learning a \"useless\" language. I hope you had more tact when you spoke to her. I could understand if she was sexualizing/fetishing you and was learning your language while being the Desi version of a Weeb. I'm not saying you're obligated to speak in the language or converse with her to improve her skills, but at the very least, you could have said something as simple as simple: eh.

How does it hurt you?", "Every language is useful.\n\nMy family spoke what is now a dying language. It\u2019s the complete opposite of useful. Yet I would have loved to have learned it. When language goes, so goes connections and pieces of culture. While that\u2019s not always a bad thing it\u2019s a decision someone can\u2019t take back.\n\nWho cares if a language is useful? Why not give your child every language you can? They, like you, can decide what\u2019s useful *to them.*", "So my advice is to forget about the language and go straight to the point and talk to her about that.\n\nAlso, it's possible that she doesn't want to do the things you ask, but she does want to do other things for you, so she does them. It's not a manipulation to say, Maybe I didn't do A because I had a problem with this, but I did B for you instead, which I didn't have a problem with.\n\nThat's not a manipulation. It could be reality. Try to not see it as a manipulation, but as a conversation and disagreements and arguments. The only question is if after the 'negotiation' you both end up with what you need, enough of what you want, and are happy with it and understand each other.\n\nIf her only way not to manipulate you is only doing what you ask, and never doing what you don't ask - she won't ever be able to do it, because again she's not a robot. (And vice verse).\n\nAlso her doing only what she wants and you don't get your needs met is also not good (and vice verse).\n\nYou need to find a way to understand each other and have both your needs met together. It's not a manipulation - it's the negotiation you have to go through when there are opposing needs and it always happens. You either find a way to understand each other and compromise, or it will end. But it takes time and experience to learn to do it.", "So learning something new always has to have a purpose?
