I think you failed to see that her effort was likely for her to feel closer to you and your family. You're only seeing it from your perspective. I think you should listen to her reasons. It's also not your perogative to tell her she can't try to learn a language that is connected with your culture. I think you both need to discuss it and get to the root of things.", "NAH. You get to have your feelings and viewpoints on your parents' native language. But I think you missed the intention of what your gf was trying to do. She sees a future with you, dude. She may be thinking she wants to show your family she respects their background, or she may be thinking if you reach the stage of having children, she can help you pass down the language. I realize you're pretty young and that kind of thing may not be on your radar yet (or ever) and that's totally okay if it's not. But I think when you came at your gf with this \"why are you giving me a gift I don't want\" response, she may have felt rejected on a larger level. \n\nThis isn't an \"asshole\" issue, in my opinion, it's a \"sit down and communicate about your relationship\" issue.", "NAH. She probably wants to do something to feel like she's connecting with your family. You are giving the logical argument that it would be a lot of unnecessary work for her. She may be upset because she could be interpreting what you said as \"why bother, we're not likely to stay together anyway.\" Sometimes people read more into these things than what was meant.", "I work with kids from immigrant families and get the dubious honor of watching heritage language loss in action. It makes me sad and frustrated but, aside from supporting families in speaking their native languages at home and loudly dispelling misinformation about dual language learners, there\u2019s not much I can do. \n\nIdk, I think your rejection of her efforts is weird.

Whilst you are allowed to your position, you didn't have to enforce it so strongly. She's also likely telling you she would appreciate it if you learnt Dutch.", "NTA !! I am so confused by the non-NTA votes here, especially the ones claiming that you were angry or controlling or hiding something in your language, since nowhere in your post was that indicated. As an Indian, I completely get it. You just let her know that she should learn it if she really wants to, not just because of you. I was born and brought up outside India (now living in India), and even I don't speak any language except English. I think there was nothing wrong with your reaction. There are plenty of other ways for you two to connect, some of which were mentioned by other commenters. Her \"you should be grateful\" response is bizarre and condescending.", "NTA.\n\nI can somewhat relate as I'm half-French, half-Mauritian, and while I do understand Mauritian cr\u00e9ole, I've never spoken it a lot since my parents spoke only French at home when I was younger.\nMy husband's understands a bit of it, but it's more because he hears my family speak it than because of me.\n\nIf she wants to learn the language to feel more included when your family drops into their navite language, it's her right and rather normal - and only learning oral comprehension is far easier than getting into writing and reading.\nSo your reaction to offer to teach her some sentences in your native language was clearly the more logical in this situation.\n\nThe fact she got upset about it is honestly a bit strange, but maybe she felt you didn't appreciate her efforts in trying to share something from your own culture with you.\nYou could maybe find something else that's culturally yours and more important to share with her? Watching films with subtitles, cooking, whatever interests you and you'd actually enjoy sharing with her?\n(My husband and I regularly look up bits about Mauritian History and things like this because this is something we enjoy and of we both love Mauritian cuisine)\n\nAnd of course reciprocate about her own culture, she maybe wanting to share more with you but hadn't managed to convey it to you.\n\nGood luck!", "Nta.

Learning a new language is never a waste of time. Just because you stopped putting in the effort to be able to read and write it, doesn\u2019t mean its worthless.

If she's solely doing it for your benefit then it does feel like a slight waste of time, since it sounds like you almost exclusively speak English. I think encouraging her to learn some simple phrases is a good idea.", "NAH I understand where you both are coming from but I think she sees it as way of integrating more with your family. I know they all speak English but she probably thinks it would impress them if she learned their native language.\n\nI think to her, it's a sign that she's there for the long haul and your reaction makes it seem like she doesn't need to bother because she may not be around forever.", "YTA.  Sounds like you lost your only means of hiding communications from your girlfriend in plain sight.

Just because OP never expressed the same level of interest in his own culture, or the fact he himself is Indian, does that justify or make it reasonable to gatekeep his gf from doing so? I just don\u2019t understand what impact his abilities and language preferences have.\n\nNobody is stupid OP. She\u2019s your girlfriend who has passed the stage of meeting your family for goodness sake, not a stranger. She certainly already knows the degree of your connection with your culture, your inability to read/write, and your preference for english.

She never asked for your discouragement either, yet you gave it to her and now here you are on Reddit.

You managed to forge a non-platonic relationship with someone whose actions you view as misguided and bizarre.

Her reasoning appears to be \u201cYou are Indian by ethnicity, so you must be Indian in all ways of life, including language.\u201d The fact that you and your family spent most of your lives here has been overlooked. I don\u2019t think either of you are AH, but maybe she should brush up on the meaning of microaggression.", "Yeah, all these people criticizing OP are literally just imposing their own values or assumptions about what OP wants. Or just what \"immigrants\" or people who aren't white Americans want. It's bizarre and does skew towards some type of savior complex. OP doesn't care all the much about the language but a lot of people in this thread seem to think they should. Who are we to tell OP what they consider culturally valuable about their own culture?\n\nThere are so many examples of threads where people will defend an OP's choices or values but somehow, this thread is 50/50 or trending in the opposite direction.", "Honestly, it seems performative given his edits.\n\nIf I wanted to learn Spanish to surprise my husband, I wouldn't text his mother to ask for resources. I'd do a web search for free programs to start.\n\nGeneralizing a bit, but is a native speaker really going to be a good font of knowledge on how to learn their language? If someone asked me how to learn English, I wouldn't know the resources! I could help them practice once they had some some proficiency, sure. But that's a different ask.", "My family didn't teach us their language and both my brother and I didn't care and still don't.\nWe share another language with all of our family as well as you do, and even when they spoke their own language and we spoke ours we never felt left out.\nI think it really is up to the individual.\nI now speak 4 languages (going on 6) but not my family one, so it's not about laziness.", "Are you deliberately not reading what OP is typing? They literally said if she wants to learn it for her own sake, she can. Why are you arguing a point that OP isn't even defending?", "Mongoloid? Dude did you think being racist was a good way to disagree with someone?", "YTA", "NTA. I ready your edit and she sounds dramatic. If she\u2019s using this as emotional blackmail, as she has other things, maybe figure out what you want from this relationship.", "NTA I get it shes making assumptions and munipulating you.", "NTA. What everyone else said, plus \u201c you should be grateful\u201d makes me think she was planning on centering her language learning endeavors over many other important relationship aspects. I imagine her stumbling around in forced conversation with your family in that language and expecting everyone to dote on her and coddle her efforts. It\u2019s giving clueless yt savior. How exhausting. Be *grateful* this came up sooner rather than later. Edit: and I\u2019m saying this as an Indian person who wishes I could speak my parents language better and appreciate its importance but cannot wrap my head around how ( most likely yt American)people feel entitled to tell you what they think you should find important! Edited a word", "Soft YTA- You telling her you don't want her gift/surprise is rude. Full stop. Don't get why other people aren't seeing the problem with that. That being said, I think you're coming from a well-meaning place in not wanting her to feel like she has to do something so difficult for you. She probably has an interest beyond doing this solely for you, though. She probably wants to feel more connected to your family, doesn't want to feel left out/like people are talking about her when they speak your parents' native language at family functions, she might want to feel more connected to your cultural background, and more long-term maybe someday she wants to raise your children to be multilingual including this language as well. Something along the lines of \"That's great that you want to do this! I just wanna be certain you don't feel like this is something you have to do for me or that I expect you to do this as I know it's a lot of work. I'd appreciate the effort even if you only end up learning a few phrases to use with my family! I just don't want you to burden yourself on my behalf, but if you have independent reasons for wanting to learn the language I'm happy to support you and help you learn too!\" The way this went down I can totally see why she feels rejected. Sometimes people do nice things for you that you don't want. Unless those nice things are crossing boundaries or causing harm or increasing difficulties for you, though, keep your mouth shut and be gracious and grateful you have people in your life that wanna do nice things for you!!!", "But should he have said that? Couldn't he be just like \"oh cool, it's great that you show interest in my culture!\". Like, you don't have to need or ask for a gift for someone to want to give you one. Like, imagine if someone bakes you a really complicated cake, and then you're like \"that's nice, but I never asked you to do that\". Like wtf? Just say thank you and move on.", "So am I, and I have yet to find decent online sources for it. I once asked my mother why she never raised me with or taught me her native tongue and she just said that I wasn't interested when I was a toddler.. lol. It isn't a language that is of much use in most countries but it would just be _nice_, yknow?", "My family on both sides is Cuban, but they all moved here to the US when both of my parents were kids, which means me and all my cousins were born here. My parents and grandparents all spoke spanish, some of them never even learned english. Out of all the cousins, I am the only one that learned spanish fluently. My mother's side never even tried to teach the kids spanish because they live in a town where its not needed, and since they barely ever saw their grandparents I guess they just didn't want to make the effort. On my father's side, my oldest cousin wasn't taught it. They tried to teach the second oldest but apparently he had some confusion with trying to learn english and spanish at the same time as a young kid, so they stopped with the spanish, and as a result of that they never even tried to teach his sister. So I was the only one in my generation that was bilingual. I do know that some of my cousins regret not learning spanish and its way harder to do it now as an adult.", "Idiot lol", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

For some context, I\u2019m Indian, born in India and moved to the states, so is my husband. We usually split between English and native languages 70-30. \n\n\nFrom what I see, she\u2019s trying to learn your language in the hopes of making some extra connection with you and your family, but if you\u2019ve made it clear that it\u2019s not necessary and will make no difference in your relationship or her relationship with your family, it just seems not worth the effort?\n\n\nYou\u2019ve already made it clear if she has an interest in the culture that she\u2019s free to learn and seems like based on your edit 2 and comments, she has a habit of holding \u201cnice things\u201d over your head. I think that is the root of the post overall and you should address that with her by having an honest chat.\n\n\nCulture and roots are what resonate with you and what you consider as impactful in defining you. It can be tied to your Indian heritage as much as you want or as little as you want and you\u2019re free to choose what you identify with. \n\n\nAnd I feel your partner should respect that. After all what she\u2019s trying to do is to connect with you, not Indian culture. So it should reflect what you identify with.  Not what she thinks you should identify with. \nHope that helps.", "NAH. I\u2019m half Indian myself, and don\u2019t speak my father\u2019s language all that well. I had this same conversation with my (non-Indian) gf, whom I eventually married. She wanted to learn Kannada and I gently told her that 1) it would be hard to learn enough to impress my folks 2) I don\u2019t speak it 3) she should learn hindi if she really wanted to learn an Indian language, as it would have more application than what my family speaks. \n\nWe\u2019re still married. She got over it, haha.", "NAH, but what harm is there in being supportive?", "NTA\nHonestly this seems very performative/white savior ish. I can see her thought process of wanting to learn it but it should have ended there when you had your talk. If you\u2019re going to learn an entirely new language and dialect solely in hopes of \u201cgetting closer\u201d to your bf and his family, especially when he told he nor his family really speak it, it\u2019s a waste of time and seems performative especially after that you should be grateful comment. There are multiple other ways to get closer to a culture than learning a language rarely spoken. There\u2019s cooking, traditions, music, stories etc. All of the people saying y t a seem to be completely ignoring how you and your family engage in YOUR culture. When you react like that to someone telling you about their own family and culture and how they engage in it, it no longer becomes about an act of kindness or good spirit but instead becomes about your ego and sense of saviorship", "Tbf, OP says that she can learn if she wants, just don\u2019t do it for him. I think that\u2019s fair. I\u2019m in a similar situation; husband wants to learn (more) Mandarin but I really don\u2019t care if he does or not as long as he doesn\u2019t involve me in his learning. I\u2019m a native English speaker and my immediate family all speak English to some degree or another. It\u2019d be nice if he learned to speak some Mandarin, but not if it means I have to play translator between him and my family at my family reunions because he\u2019s not fluent. I also want to just communicate at home and not have to teach someone another language when we speak.", "If the person who lives IN the culture decides it isn't for them and relocates to a new culture, purposely leaving it behind, who is anyone else to insist they have to push it onto the next generation? Maybe they dislike that culture for legitimate reasons and prefer that their kids not have to experience it.", "First of all you\u2019re assuming they have family in India and he has said he and his family rarely speak their language. Learning a language that they barely speak will not make her part of the culture nor somehow make her get to know him on a \u201cdeeper\u201d level", "As you know, that's what people do. It's stupid and racist, but simply further proof that no matter how anti-racist people insist they are, there is always room to be racist against Asians.", "No, it really isn't. Some of us celebrate that we were not forced to learn another language. We pick different languages to study later that we do want to know sometimes.", "You might want to consider learning Dutch on Duolingo. This is obviously how she expresses love and that she sees a future with you, so consider doing the same.

I (38f) have been born and raised in the US. My parents are also Indian immigrants. I'm married to my white American husband (40m) for nine years. I also speak and understand my parents' language fluently, but read and write like a kindergartener lol. I consider English my first language. I speak, read and write Spanish and Portuguese fluently. They came easier to me than any of the languages on the Indian subcontinent. I agree that Indian languages can be difficult to learn. I'm assuming here that knowing Dutch wouldn't be any more helpful than English.\n\nWhether it's to impress you and your family or not, would it really be that terrible if she tried? I just don't really see the harm in it at all. My family and extended family all speak English and it's not really *necessary* for my husband to speak my family's language, but if he made the effort I certainly wouldn't discourage it. I just don't think that learning any foreign language is really ever a wasted effort. The resources for some of the less extensively spoken Indian languages can be really minimal, so I understand her reaching out to your family. I guess it seems sweet and harmless and like she cares, so what's the problem? Even if it proved to be more difficult than expected and she only learned a phrase or two - why is that so bad? I think it's kind that she's making the effort.", "He literally never once told her she couldn\u2019t learn it he said if she was learning it solely for him or his family than it would be a waste of time and unnecessary which it truly would be.\nConsidering it\u2019s his culture and language they\u2019re talking about ofc he\u2019s going to talk about him and his family bc that\u2019s the only other people involved. \nThe fact that you call him uninterested in his own culture is truly ignorant. Unless you lack the ability to infer based on text it\u2019s clear the reason she is learning it and it\u2019s completely fine for him to tell her that it would be unnecessary. Learning a new language doesn\u2019t suddenly bring you closer to a culture and it sounds like you\u2019re completely ignoring how op and his family engage in their culture. You and the gf honestly seem performative, you\u2019re not doing him a favor by learning a language, and when the person who\u2019s culture your trying to learn tells you hey if you\u2019re doing this just for me or my family you shouldn\u2019t you, it would serve no purpose you shouldn\u2019t flip out on them.", "It\u2019s like someone taking hours baking a cake for you when you don\u2019t eat cake and expecting you to be grateful they took time to bake a cake you never asked for nor wanted.", "Bruh, she's fetishizing you and your culture. Your family is basically American. It's performative behaviour on her part to feel accomplished in \"accommodating\" the brown.", "That would annoy me as well.\n\nHowever, if you are interested in this relationship continuing, this could be an opportunity to think about/discuss love languages.
