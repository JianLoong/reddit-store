My husband and I both work, and we did have a babysitter who came occasionally when my husband and my work schedules collided. Our babysitter has moved out of state for college so we had to find a new one. Our new babysitter is a 20 year old girl named Olivia. She\u2019s babysat before and has all good references. She\u2019s babysat about 3 times so far, and it\u2019s only been about 4-5 hours each time. We left her alone for the whole day this first time over winter break, from 9am-4pm(usually she just gets him from the bus stop after school and is there till evening or one of gets off work.) When I got home from work my son ran up to me and told me all about his day at our club house in the neighborhood and the swimming lessons he took. I pull Olivia aside and she said she took him to swim lessons today there, (were in Florida and they have indoors pool so it\u2019s warm.) I told her that wasn\u2019t her place to sign him up for these. Our son can merely doggy paddle and I understand it\u2019s important for him to know how to swim but I feel like that should be up to us. \n\nOlivia told us she felt like he should learn and she paid for it with her own money so it wouldn\u2019t be a burden for us and that he had a blast doing it. I asked her to leave.  When I talked to my husband about this he did not react upset about it and when I told him I thought we should fire her and look for a new sitter since our son is going to need one since he\u2019s out of school this week, he said that\u2019d be an AH move and that she\u2019s still young, and thought she was doing a nice thing. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be the AH because I feel like that should be a decision made between my husband and I and not the babysitter.\n\nInfo: we haven\u2019t taught our son how to swim yet because we both have tight work schedules, and where we lived before there wasn\u2019t many times of the year you could swim. I know it\u2019s something we need to do, but We just moved to Florida 2 years ago and havent gotten around to it yet nor has he been around the water much.", "created_utc": 1672633319, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10133zv/wibta_for_firing_my_babysitter_for_taking_my_son/", "score": 518, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it would, then why is the lesson over the line? If it wouldn\u2019t, then you need to make clear that the pool is off limits.", "Okay, while I appreciate Olivia wanting to teach your son swimming, I feel like you\u2019re NTA because she didn\u2019t get your (the parent\u2019s) permission nor did she give you a heads up that your son was going to do swimming lessons on her watch.

The movies? Petting zoo? Playground?\n\nAnd Olivia spent her own money on this, which is actually kind of crazy generous.\n\nIdeally, yeah, maybe she should have told you and you should have paid, but I don't think Olivia did anything actually \\*wrong\\* here, maybe just a touch blas\u00e9.\n\nYou'd be an asshole if you fired her over this.", "INFO: Why have you not taught your son to properly swim yet/signed him up for lessons?\n\nETA: YTA for not teaching your 8 year old to swim properly (for both safety reasons and because swimming is super fun) or putting him in swimming lessons (my almost 8 *month* old has already done a set of swimming lessons) and you will be a giant asshole if you fire this babysitter because she sounds awesome and very kind.", "NTA. She really overstepped and broke your trust.", "ESH: I'm Australian. EVERY kid learns to swim here. It's part of school curriculum. Because drownings happen a lot and being able to swim and learning how to act in the water are the best defences your kid can have.\n\nShe shouldn't have signed him up and taken him, even if she meant well in doing so. YOU should have done this already.", "You live in Florida and your 8 year old can't swim?? Olivia is right, he needs to learn. Accidents happen all the time and this is a skill he needs. I do however agree that she should have discussed it with you prior to taking him. I don't think she had malicious intent, and I wouldn't have fired her for it.\nESH her for not discussing it, you for your reaction and please get your son some lessons.", "I vote YTA because while I agree that this is really a parental decision, you\u2019ve now expressed that to the babysitter and things should be fine from here. She should have now realized where she messed up. Taking it further (to the point of firing her) when she did something that is actually quite good and kind for your son makes this an AH move. \n\nAt 8 years old, you are pretty late to have not had him take something that amounts to survival  skills. I\u2019m kinda glad for your son that the babysitter had the forethought to help you out with that. In the same shoes, I would reimburse her for the swimming lessons. She definitely doesn\u2019t deserve to be complained about or fired. Just tell her how important it is to discuss decisions like this one with parents.", "YTA for living in Florida and not teaching your 8-year-old how to swim.", "YTA.\n\nYou are upset because of the safety concerns of your son taking swim lessons and he struggles with swimming and because you presumably wanted to be the one to help him through this.\n\nThe babysitter paid her own money for these classes and it seems like her motives were well placed and its really not an erratic or unsafe thing to take a kid struggling with learning to swim to swim lessons.  It's not like she took him to the pond by herself in an unsafe manner.  \n\nI understand why you are upset but if you fire a reliable and caring babysitter over this, you are taking it too far and an asshole.", "Info- did you tell her she could take your son out of the house for activities?", "NTA\n\nGenerally it takes a signed parental consent form to sign a kid up for swim lessons, at least where I live, so I wondering how this even happened. Did she pretend to be you when she signed him up? Signing a kid up for any activity should definitely be a parent only decision. Had she come to you and said something along the lines of, hey I noticed the local club house is offering swim lessons this week can I take your son to get him out of the house and you said sure - that would be one thing. But to make that decision unilaterally, nope that's crossing a boundary and sends up a red flag.", "YTA - I was going to say NTA as I assumed your kid was younger and you were upset to miss out on a key kid experience but then I see he\u2019s 8 years old and can\u2019t swim! Wtf.", "NTA I\u2019m surprised she could even sign him up without parental permission. 100% should have checked with you first. Was she even allowed to take him somewhere? I know a lot of places I used to sit in college did not want us to leave their property", "NTA because she didn\u2019t talk to you first - I would be hella pissed if someone took it upon themselves to do something like that without even mentioning it to me as the mother.", "NTA that is a huge breach of trust. She was being brainless. What was she thinking ? you don't just do that without parental when you babysit !", "YTA", "NAH.\n\nAlthough I admit to being VERY biased in favor of swimming lessons for the safety of all children, (It took me 6 years to convince my best friend to get her kids in lessons, a decision she later wished she'd made sooner, as her 22 year old daughter who never went to pool parties as a kid because she was fearful and embarrassed at not knowing how to swim at all still has residual fear around bigger bodies of water.)   I wouldn't take someone else's children to lessons without their consent, and you are certainly not an AH for having an issue with a sitter who does.   But you also don't know what kind of relationship she has with other babysitting clients--she may have other folks who give her much more freedom to decide what the kids will be doing, or even encourage her to set the agenda, so what seems obvious to you might not be to her, and it sounds like her intentions were actually quite good.\n\nIf she is competent and has been a positive experience in other ways, I would first sit down and establish where your boundaries are.   If there is reason to believe she won't accept or respect them, of course fire her.   But good, reliable, caring sitters are actually pretty hard to come by, so it seems like it would be worth making that effort before dumping her.", "Uhhhhh no. This is so dangerous and so inappropriate she did this without your permission. And honestly dumb of her because if a kid gets injured or worse, dies, she\u2019ll be sued into oblivion. She didn\u2019t even seem apologetic when you confronted her. Even if she thought it was utterly ridiculous: you are her boss. You are the parent. What you says goes. She not only did she do something that no normal, respectable, professional babysitter/nanny would do, but she disregarded and belittled your concerns. What other parenting choices of yours is she going to bulldoze over? The nanny is there to enforce your parenting rules. Not be a third parent. NTA", "YTA. \n\nHonestly, it's a bit baffling that you are offended by someone trying to make your kid's life better and safer. \n\n\nAre you going to get mad when his school teaches him to dance or do gymnastics because you never got him lessons? \n\n\n8 is also pretty old to be learning basic swimming skills living in a state with so many beaches and pools.", "ESH, you for not having your kid signed up for swimming lesson, y'all are in florida - he needs to be able to swim. her for doing it without your consent.", "Surprised by all the YTAs. As someone who works with kids...this is insane. I'd be fired so quick if I did that without parental consent. It wouldn't even cross my mind to have the audacity to make that decision without the parent's consent.\n\nDo I think the kid should learn to swim? Oh completely. Not teaching a child a basic safety skill as dumb as hell. However it is completely not my place to make that decision. There's many things parents do that I don't think are all that smart or should be done differently...but that doesn't mean it's my job to butt in and tell them how to raise their child. If she was really concerned she could have brought it up with them as a possible activity she'd love to do and ask if they'd mind.\n\nNTA (but do please teach your child to swim)", "YTA, she tried to do a nice thing, I understand your concerns about her overstepping. It would be appropriate to have a conversation with her about how she needs your permission for certain things in the future but firing her seems pretty ridiculous to me.", "NTA to be concerned that the babysitter took action to commit your son to swim lessons. BUT, this is a positive experience for your son. Eight is the perfect age to learn to swim. It build confidence and can save their life.\n\nYes, you should have been asked prior, but from the standpoint of a 60 year old, looking back on raising a child, if a babysitter had taken this initiative with my child, I wouldn\u2019t fire them. I would use this as an educational experience for the sitter and grant permission in this one instance. Going forward, all other out of home activities must be approved. A second chance is called for.", "YTA. She tried to do something fun and potentially life saving for him.", "YTA. Though it's not that big of a deal. Explain to her why you were upset and move past it. It sounds like this person really cares for your kid if they took their own money and paid for him to get a lesson. Consent is an important thing to discuss and maybe you can turn this into a teaching moment for the babysitter. Best of luck, whichever course you take.", "NTA \n\nBabysitter has no right to take your son out of the house and sign him up for classes without your  previous consent.\n\nI get it, swimming is useful/fun, but there are many things that could go wrong and as a babysitter, she was way out of line. \n\nNow is swimming, tomorrow will be something else.\n\nFind a sitter who understands concepts like boundaries and liability.", "YTA. What she did was so sweet. Plus husband seems to approve. Plusssss it sounds like your son enjoyed it too.", "YTA your kid is already 8 and can only doggy paddle. Why isn\u2019t teaching him important to you? Swimming is a life skill. You should be ashamed that your babysitter cares more about your kid than you. And he had a good time. All you care about is yourself. What\u2019s wrong with you.", "YTA I agree with your husband and the baby sitter on this one. \n\nIf you trusted her enough to put your son in her care, then you should trust her judgment to not put him in harm\u2019s way regardless of what it is. She took him for a fun activity that she paid for. A skill that is very important for people to learn. She\u2019s giving him a wonderful gift of Water survival skills, exercise, and some fun. They\u2019re at a safe location where there is not only the swim instructor(s) but also lifeguards and the people that the children show up with around to watch them. He wasn\u2019t in much danger.\n\nWould you expect her to ask you before she took him to the park? Or helped him learn to roller skate or ride a bike?  Is she expected to ask you before she feeds him at a restaurant? \n\nPerhaps she should have asked you first what she wanted to do, just for permission, but firing her for making an assumption that you\u2019d be fine with your son learning water survival skills it is ridiculous. Why in the world would you even be upset about him learning a skill that everyone should learn in their lifetime?  It could save his life some day.", "So she definitely overstepped and I get that you feel judged but IMO an 8yo should be able to swim better than doggy paddle. For a first offence, which it sounds like this is, it\u2019s a pretty helpful one, and very generous if she paid for it herself. I feel YWBTA if you fired her off the back of that.", "Not a parent but definitely appalled by the notion that you *could* be an AH here. The little one's safety is not something to toy around with, even with good intentions. At the very least Olivia should have *asked* instead of making the choice herself. She's a babysitter, meaning she has limited authority which she should acknowledge.", "YTA only because there was no accident at the pool.  However, babysitter does read like a keeper.  Gotta work on communication.", "YTA!  Because you have an 8 year old in Florida that doesn't know how to swim yet!!!  Good for the babysitter.", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re in Florida and haven\u2019t taught your 8 yo how to swim??? This seems insane to me. I don\u2019t know one kid here who doesn\u2019t know how to swim. Get him lessons yourself, NOW. Babysitter was not wrong.", "References all good. Makes one non-life threatening decision that shows real interest in your child's personal growth that you don't agree with--fire her?  Simply speak to her as an adult with a calm voice and say you're uncomfortable with that activity. Maybe an alternate activity is a water balloon or sprinkler party at the house? Seems like your gut response is impulsive. YTA", "Your kid should learn how to swim. There's too many stories out there that people drowned in calm waters because they didn't know how to swim or stay at least stay afloat. I", "NTA - while obviously very unlikely, but what if they'd been an incident at the swimming lesson or it had gone really badly? She didn't have your permission and it would've been awful. I wouldn't take my niece or nephews to an activity without at least mentioning it to my sister, let alone non-family. \n\nThink you're right to react this way, as she should've known that big activities should be discussed and agreed beforehand. This reflects a lack of judgement that could apply to other activities too.", "Ehh YTA. You\u2019d 100% be the AH if you fire her over this. She did something fun for your son with her own money to not burden you. She was doing it out of kindness. Sure, she should\u2019ve asked but I honestly don\u2019t think she thought he was in any danger. It was a swim lesson so someone was there to teach your son. How much fun did your son have? Sounds like he was raving about it & that matters. \n\nMaybe you should discuss things she can do w your son outside of the home so she knows the expectations. Leave a list of fun activities on the fridge & ice-cream money or something so she\u2019s not paying for things outta pocket.", "something is fishy. why doesn\u2019t your son know how to swim at 8??? it\u2019s actually VERY dangerous to not know how to swim. \n\n\ni doubt your baby sitter paid for swim lessons, and i highly doubt any instructor would let someone sign up a child that was obviously not theirs. idk just my BS meter is going off", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it is SO inappropriate to take a kid somewhere like that without permission!", "The other day there was a parent who wrote a post about firing a sitter who let her mom in for 15 minutes without prior approval and the OP was fully supported. I think this is the equivalent, if not worse. The parents should make the decision about where the child goes and vet any place the child goes.

Watching from the side? Or did she just hand him over to an instructor and walk away? Was the instructor accredited or licensed or just a local volunteer?

Someone took it upon themselves to try and teach my daughter a physical skill WITHOUT ASKING ME and my child got hurt. \n\nBabysitter should have asked first, in both situations.", "The point is that the parents should have been not just notified beforehand but asked for permission. At the end of the day, it should have been their choice. \n\nI\u2019m surprised the people at the pool accepted teaching a kid that wasn\u2019t signed up by the parents too.", "OP also posted about a near death experience where she almost drowned as a child. Guessing she might have a fear of swimming and keeping her kid away from water on purpose, which will only backfire considering how much water they live around.", "Yea I looked at her post history where she said she wants 3 or 4 kids but they sound too busy for the one they have.", "I agree, and granted I've never hired a babysitter or babysat in this capacity but I thought it was generally agreed upon that anything out of the ordinary should be approved beforehand. Like taking a kid to the grocery store or the playground, sure, but I think starting a kid in lessons or extracurriculars probably need to be discussed. Idk. The family is definitely still the AH but I feel like it was weird for the babysitter to start a kid in swim lessons without ever mentioning it", "Yeah what I am saying is that if I left my kid with a sitter and came home and she had taken them to any of these types of activities with no prior discussion, that would be very weird to me. The activity itself isn't really the issue, it's that I would expect her to have cleared it with me, if only so that I would have a general idea of where my kid was. \n\nObviously, it could be a slippery slope and I guess if it was the park on the corner that is different, and OP could have set expectations, but in my experience with babysitting, I think leaving the house with the kid at all warrants a conversation. The fact that this babysitter didn't think to float this first is why I commented that she displayed poor or at least strange judgement.", "I\u2019m a former lifeguard. It seems very unusual to me that a program had an open space the day of lessons. And On New Year\u2019s Day?  A stat?  Lessons typically stop over breaks, something about the story is way off.", "Yeah, that post had me wondering if I have been too lax. One minute I feel like a helicopter parent and the next I feel like I am not diligent enough. I guess that's part of parenting...pouring yourself into these tiny humans while at the same time letting go bit by bit.", "I live in Ontario as well and my child was in swimming lessons at 5 months old and could swim\nOn their own by 3. I feel swimming lessons should be mandatory", "This sounds like her own personal issue of trauma with the water. She needs therapy and to allow that girl to continue to babysit. The girl sounds like she really really cares for that child and she should be thanking her. YTA OP!  Get it together before your kid drowns because you can't put your big girl panties on and deal with your trauma like an adult.", "Look in her post history. Funny how she can comment they\u2019ve been actively trying for 5 months instead of helping the kid they already have learn the basics of survival in Florida", "What does that have to do with swimming?", "This honestly makes me mad. I live in a state that's not surrounded by water and I don't have a lot of money, but my toddlers have still been taught to swim because safety comes first. I don't know how to swim and I almost drowned in a wave pool when I was 11. So my kids were in lessons as soon as possible.", "I live in Canada and we were put in swimming lessons since we were small. The local college offered them on weekends. \n\nLiterally no excuse , if you can live somewhere cold and put your kid in lessons it should have been first priority when they moved to Florida when the child was 6", "> ABSOLUTELY should have said something to the parents.\n\nAgreed 110%, though for different reasons. Leaving your kids in someone else's care is one of so many gradual losses of absolute control over your child's safety. For the emotional well-being of the parents particularly in regards to maintaining what of that control remains, overcommunication is key. \n\n> What if something bad had happened!?\n\nI thoroughly don't understand this part, though. Are you referring to going outside the house in general (which was already a part of their days together), or swimming? I see zero tangible risk to taking guided lessons surrounded by trained professionals who are aware that they're overseeing youth who cannot yet swim confidently. \n\nWhat happens when something goes wrong? The medically trained staff and presumably large community present react as best they can. I'm protective of my kiddo but not under the impression that our bond means I'd be better than the next person if there was an emergency. Do exactly what you would with any other emergency; keep kiddo safe, reassured, and call me the second everything's stable.\n\nThe truly terrifying thing about your kid getting past that 5-6 year mark is that they *will* have a life outside of you. That is healthy and good. You cannot be the sole source of safety for your child until adulthood.", "That's fair but still not really related to your experience. You should have just stated your opinion instead of making false equivalence.", "But you were making a point about insurance and liability with your comment. Just pointing out your situation is different than the situation of AITA on those issues.", "I think she had permission to take him out places. The lessons could of been spur of the moment. They went to the neighbourhood pool she saw they were starting lessons that day and she thought it would be a nice thing to do for the kid.", "In elementary school there is no way a friend's parent would take me to a pool without giving my parents a heads up. Even for kids that can swim shit happens- roughhousing in the pool, 'diving' in the shallow end, etc.", "I feel like everyone has a different concept and experience on what \"normal\" activities are, though. You can't communicate ineffectively and then get mad when a misunderstanding occurs. Sure, I'd probably want my babysitter to at least give us a heads up if it was something a bit more special or out of the ordinary, but I also recognise that keeping our kids entertained is a bloody hard job.", "I got the impression (and I could be wrong) that outside activities were going to be allowed. I agree having a general idea of the day\u2019s planned activities is an expectation I would have as well, which leads me to think mom didn\u2019t set clear boundaries to begin with and didn\u2019t ask about the day\u2019s plans. Basically, I got the impression that this mom that is *just tooo busy in the past two years to bother getting her kid into swim lessons* (makes me wonder if she has him in any other extracurricular activities) is also probably *too busy* to properly communicate with a babysitter then blames the babysitter for not understanding that something was off-limits. \n\nBecause, I can imagine how my conversation would be going with babysitter when she got there in the morning:\n\n\u201cHere are the emergency numbers. I have xyz food in the fridge or you can make abc (whatever is available). Husband should be home by x time and I\u2019ll be home at y time but we are both reachable by phone. What plans do y\u2019all have for the day?\u201d", "I was seriously wondering about this too considering it\u2019s the winter time, but I tried to give it the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThanks for sharing this. Knowing this, the story could be fake.", "We take our son to a local indoor pool for lessons. They were closed new year\u2019s eve day but open this afternoon. The way they work is you can either sign up for scheduled weekly lessons, or sign up for each lesson individually. This is what we do since our availability is changing all the time. You can see who the instructor is on the scheduling portal on their website so we just pick an open time slot with one of the three instructors our child is comfortable with. So if their set up is similar, that could be possible. \n\nBabysitter would have had to forge signatures on the paperwork though, which is not okay. I\u2019ve never heard of any swim lessons that don\u2019t have release of liability paperwork for the parent or legal guardian to sign. So she would have had to misrepresent herself and forge it.", "Mine is 1st year college, officially \"grown\", but learning disabilities & that covid 2 year world shutdown gap took a significant toll on maturity & teen milestones, typical of 15-18 yr olds.  So I have to keep my mind off of should've, would've, could'ves at this point.  I focus a lot on the now, with hope for future. \n\nBut I know, when they were little, I was a helicopter parent compared to some, but by most, I was too lax.  For my own kid, it was what was most needed.  \ud83d\ude0a\n\nI just wish I had figured out the dyspraxia earlier than a few months ago.  Not a single dr figured out the clues of a child so clumsy. Early intervention could have made a huge difference.", "How? Any time our parents signed me and my sibs up for anything, they had to sign a million consent forms and waivers. They need to cover their asses in case your son got injured during the lessons. They need his medical insurance info, a list of medical conditions, an emergency contact number... Either she impersonated you, or these lessons aren't on the up and up.", "I've literally never heard of a place accepting a minor for swim lessons *without* their parents or guardians permission. Not even in a membership type place.", "The woman who taught most the the people my age in the area was a registered teacher but taught from her home, she was comfortable with under 3\u2019s. And at the time the local indoor pool didn\u2019t offer lessons to non school aged children at all.", "Especially since, as she said in this post, they apparently have access to a warm, indoor pool. That offers lessons. So you can swim year round, and all they'd need is to arrange for someone to take kiddo to and from lessons.", "In her comment history, she describes how she almost drowned at 7yo and how scared she was. Yet still hasn't got her son lessons in 8 years.", "I\u2019m new to Reddit. Just joined today after months of reading AITA posts on Facebook from reddit. I didn\u2019t know you could look at other posts from a specific user!", "One theory is that she drowned in the pool and it was covered up.", "Many people believe she drowned in the backyard pool and then there was an attempt to cover up the accidental death.", "Where I'm from, a parent/guardian has to sign a waiver for a child to take swimming lessons because, though rare, bad things like injury and even drowning can indeed happen. And I doubt whether a 20-year-old babysitter qualifies as a legal guardian.\n\nIs OP an asshole for not getting her child into swimming before now? Yes. But the fact is, the babysitter should absolutely have checked with the parents first. So ESH.", "Yep I hear what you are saying, but the idea that the babysitter would default to a paid activity that - to me - feels as involved as signing him up for swimming lessons feels so weird and like such a leap. Clearly I am alone in this based on the downvotes, but that is why I think it shows such strange judgement. \n\nPersonally, I would have been clearer with the babysitter (and if OP was clear about expectations, that obviously needs to be added in an edit), but I also would expect - in the absence of clarity - for the default be for the babysitter to ask, and in light of not knowing, to assume that you should just stay home or nearby. \n\nYep I hear what you are saying, but the idea that the babysitter would default to a paid activity that - to me - feels as involved as signing him up for swimming lessons feels so weird and like such a leap.

We knew something was different but didn't know what exactly what. Tried a few times to get a diagnosis before kindergarten with no luck. But thankfully the kindergarten teachers noted something too and, armed with that support, we were able to get a rec for OT, which has helped tremendously. But without their support, I think the peds would have kept telling us it will get better as they get older.", "Click on their username and select profile.  You can see their posts and comments.  Like the comment she made about her scariest life moment being when she nearly drowned at age 7...", "I can definitely see your point of view. And I agree I would be pissed if a babysitter overstepped like that. But I feel like a lot of that anger (if I\u2019m honest with myself) would stem from me not being explicit about what I expected in a babysitter and me not checking in). At 20, the girl is still pretty young. I don\u2019t think she will have (in most normal circumstances) the life experiences of a mom with an 8-year-old, so giving grace, when everyone sucks, should be the default (at least for me).", "Are you kidding me?! She nearly drowned as a child, but is very *meh, whatever* about making sure her son knows how to swim .. wow. \n\nI didn't have a lot of respect for her before I knew that, but now. Ugh.", "Thank you!! I\u2019ll definitely be doing that more often!!", "How do you vote in these dam things!!??", "I find the YTA's in this thread where people are like \"she did you a huge favour\" a bit much. If it's my uess I could kind of go either way and could see just explicitly outlining expectations going forward and moving on, *but* I think my confidence would still be shaken that stuff would keep cropping up (e.g. \"oh we ran into \\[friend\\] and we decided to go to their house\" without clearing it, etc etc). But I guess I am just uptight about my kid!\n\nI find the YTA's in this thread where people are like \"she did you a huge favour\" a bit much. If its my *kid* I expect a little more deference and communication (never had a sitter that wasn't pretty communicative via text as well, so it rings odd that the sitter didn't text if it was spontaneous). What if the family had swimming lessons planned, or the kid had a history of earaches/whatever issue that prevented swimming? Any number of things - just seems so weird.", "Yup!  Total YTA! \n\n\"When I was 7 I wandered away from my parents at the beach and got pulled out by the current, and pulled fully underwater. I couldn\u2019t pull myself up. I could feel my lungs filling up with water and my chest began to burn and I kept thrashing which was making everything worse. Right before I passed out my dad ripped me out of the water.\""]}
