It came as a shock to both me and my boyfriend, as we were using protection but quickly learnt that aside from celibacy, no method is 100% effective. My boyfriend told his parents and I told mine, and my parents asked that I invited my boyfriend & his family over for dinner, to discuss the baby. The day of the dinner fell on a day I had a scan, the same scan where I found out it was twins, and so I called my and my boyfriend's family beforehand to let them know, so there was no surprises at dinner.\n\nThe dinner itself was going fairly smooth until an awkward silence fell, after my boyfriend made an innocent joke claiming that a year ago me and him barely knew each other, and now here I was almost 4 months pregnant (I found out rather late). My dad paused for a few moments, before he began yelling about how my boyfriend had ruined my life and how if I had gotten an abortion that maybe he could've forgiven me. I retaliated by saying that if he felt that way then he didn't have to be apart of mine or my children's lives and I left with my boyfriend and his family shortly after.\n\nFor the remainder of my pregnancy none of my parent's reached out and I was certainly not about to reach out first either, and continued focusing on getting my apartment ready for the babies. About five or so months later, I began labour and had my grandmother, boyfriend and his mum in the delivery room, and after 15 hours I was holding my sons.\n\nA few weeks went by and I had woken up to my social media being flooded with angry comments and hateful posts from my parents, stated I had hid my pregnancy and labour from the all together. I made a somewhat peaceful post back, announcing I had told my parents and that they stated they wanted nothing to do with my pregnancy and hadn't reached out. And soon people took my side as they read all the screenshots of hurtful messages I got from my parents after the dinner, that I had posted. My mum called me a few weeks after birth to say she was hurt, and what I did was spiteful and will hurt my children in the future. Because they will learn I 'hid them from their grandparents and banished their grandparents from seeing them'. \n\nBut I don't see it that way, as a mother I cannot understand why I would intentionally surround my sons around two people who really couldn't care for them and who continuously bash their parents. Since then, I have cut off contact and have never been happier, but occasionally receive a message from a relative asking me to contact my parents and let them meet my sons, and my plan to 'make them wait' has gone on long enough.

You are fine. You need to protect your family from hateful people. Can you imagine the crap your dad might say around those kids when they visit and you aren't right there??? \"If your mom had just aborted you...\" - crap like that. Just because someone shares your blood doesn't make them family. Family are the people who love and support you in all that you do (like your grandma, your bf's mum, etc). Those are your family now. You don't need hateful cruel people around.", "NTA at all!! your dad admitted he wanted your babies **dead** - if it were me he would *never* meet them. Stick to your guns mama", "NTA. Unless they are using these other relatives to relay their apologies, they still think they are entitled to your kids without respecting you as their mom.", "NTA\n\nIf the truth about your actions casts you in a bad light, then the problem is not the truth. The problem is your actions. \n\nYour parents expressed that they wanted NOTHING to do with your kids. They were hurtful and cruel. My bet? They only started wanting contact when they could leverage it, or when them not having contact made them look bad. \n\nStay no contact. Stay happy. If your relatives are going to pester you, maybe kindly remind them (feel free to include the screenshots) of what your parents said, how they treated you, that they did not support you. THEY decided not to see your kids. Your kids are not props they get to come crawling back to so they can pretend to be doting grandparents and good people.", "NTA. Being a grandparent is a privilege and not a right. As their mother, you're one of their two sole protectors in the world. This isn't just about physically protecting them but also mentally and emotionally as well. Your parents' actions speak volumes. They could've reached out and apologize for 'heat of the moment' anger and their hurtful messages but they didn't. Instead of apologizing, they aren't acknowledging their actions and instead turning relatives into flying monkeys to shame you into contact. Stay strong. Your twins still have other loving and accepting family members including paternal grandparents.", "NTA. I hope your  inlaws are supportive, loving grandparents", "Ok, they were assholes. \n\nBut unless there is more history here, it is worth giving them a.chance to be better people and meet the twins. \n\nThe fact that your parents were angry that their 21 year old was knocked up with twins, while not admirable, is a little understandable. \n\nOffer them the chance and be explicit that it is an offered chance to be a part of their grandchildren's life, and not a god given right.  \n\nTheir tune may change once they meet them. \n\nIf it doesn't, if they can't let it go, then by all means keep your walls up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They tried to publicly smear you and make you look bad, and after the way they spoke about you, your boyfriend, and your pregnancy, they don't deserve to meet your sons. Your sons will be better off not being raised around such toxic people, and I'm sure you, your boyfriend, and your boyfriend's family will provide them with enough love to make up for your parents not being around", "Nta. Your boys come first and it's great you're already protecting them.", "Unless they have given a heartfelt apology then they haven\u2019t changed.", "They were offered a chance at the dinner and they told OP she should have had an abortion.\n\nThey had five months to think about what they did and said, and to reach out. They chose not to. \n\nTheir reaction to the birth of the babies was more negativity and malice. \n\nThey have shown their true colors.", "I suspect you'll find that there is a long history of toxcity to the OP during her childhood.  It may not have been overt physical abuse but I bet you there was a lot of controlling manipulation and words that were designed to hurt but the only people that realised were the ones that the words were directed to.\n\nIt takes a special person to say what they said at the dinner with the inlaws and they deserve nothing.  You could never trust them to not hurt the children with their words and actions.", "NTA\n\nThe family members that are saying to make contact are called flying monkeys.  They either don't have the full story (ie the truth) or they are enablers and think your parents behaviour is acceptable.\n\nNope, I would stay no contact.  \n\nYour mothers words are ironic... 'How could you put all that on social media and it was spiteful?'  She needs to take a good, long hard look at what she put up on social media first.  She wasn't expecting you to have kept their texts and messages... that turned around and bit them on the arse... hard.  Their true character was revealed.", "What's with parents/ family first making angry and offensive remarks and when a major event happens they expect to the guests of honour\n\nEdit NTA\nThey are AH", "NTA. When the flying monkeys start up about letting your parents meet their grandchildren, reply \"oh, you mean the grandchildren they wanted aborted?\"\n\nEnjoy your NC and have a beautiful life.", "Definitely not an AH. Your parents are old enough to know better but instead, they doubled down so let them wallow in self pity while you invest in your twins development. I would say explain to them when they are old enough, why you do not have contact. That way they won't be blindsided by some comments that are sure to follow.", "NTA- You nor your children, need that toxicity in your lives. Remind them they wanted you to abort, and stated your life was ruined, claimed they couldn't forgive you.  so how loving would they really be to the littles? Tell the flying monkeys to mind their own, Your Parents are MORE Than Aware of what they did wrong!", "NTA also cut off anyone who still backs them or comes back later and tries to excuse their behaviour with \u201cbut they\u2019re your parents\u201d", "NTA. Even if things were good, you don't have to do anything. It's your labor and your baby. \n\nWith my first our whole family was up there and it was aweful. Every other pregnancy, it was just my husband and I until we invited people up. You do what you need to do. No one else matters in that moment but you and baby.", "Nope your not. I don't talk to my parents because every time I do. They stress me out. I am currently trying to get pregnant with my husband. Stress is the last time I need. Since when I do get pregnant.  It will take a big toll on my body. With my husband being in the army and away a lot. Last thing I need is more stress. So no you are not being an asshole.", "NTA they expected you to beg their forgiveness", "NTA! \n\nFor everyone who decides they get an opinion on letting your parents be around your children AND for your parents when they say anything. Ask them why they want/get to meet them when THEY cut contact with you and wanted them to be aborted. THEY didn't want them then so WHY do they feel entitled to them NOW???", "Agreed. It is one thing for the pregnant woman to decide on an abortion or adoption because it is her life and her body, a partner can have their say but the final decision lies with the one who is pregnant.\n\nIf I were OP and had already decided abortion and adoption weren't options I was comfortable with and had chosen to keep my baby/babies then you can be damn sure anyone telling me I should have taken either of those options is getting cut of from my children, end of discussion. \"You don't want them in my life well guess what, that's easy fixed. Stay away from me and my family, your not in our lives anymore.\"", "Exactly. We see no sense of remorse on their part for their words, only an entitled complaints and anger about being denied contact with \"their\" grandchildren.\n\nNTA. Maybe when they lose their pride and entitlement and acknowledge how hurtful their words were, will they deserve a place in your children's lives."]}
