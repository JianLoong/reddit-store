It came as a shock to both me and my boyfriend, as we were using protection but quickly learnt that aside from celibacy, no method is 100% effective. My boyfriend told his parents and I told mine, and my parents asked that I invited my boyfriend & his family over for dinner, to discuss the baby. The day of the dinner fell on a day I had a scan, the same scan where I found out it was twins, and so I called my and my boyfriend's family beforehand to let them know, so there was no surprises at dinner.\n\nThe dinner itself was going fairly smooth until an awkward silence fell, after my boyfriend made an innocent joke claiming that a year ago me and him barely knew each other, and now here I was almost 4 months pregnant (I found out rather late). My dad paused for a few moments, before he began yelling about how my boyfriend had ruined my life and how if I had gotten an abortion that maybe he could've forgiven me. I retaliated by saying that if he felt that way then he didn't have to be apart of mine or my children's lives and I left with my boyfriend and his family shortly after.\n\nFor the remainder of my pregnancy none of my parent's reached out and I was certainly not about to reach out first either, and continued focusing on getting my apartment ready for the babies. About five or so months later, I began labour and had my grandmother, boyfriend and his mum in the delivery room, and after 15 hours I was holding my sons.\n\nA few weeks went by and I had woken up to my social media being flooded with angry comments and hateful posts from my parents, stated I had hid my pregnancy and labour from the all together. I made a somewhat peaceful post back, announcing I had told my parents and that they stated they wanted nothing to do with my pregnancy and hadn't reached out. And soon people took my side as they read all the screenshots of hurtful messages I got from my parents after the dinner, that I had posted. My mum called me a few weeks after birth to say she was hurt, and what I did was spiteful and will hurt my children in the future. Because they will learn I 'hid them from their grandparents and banished their grandparents from seeing them'. \n\nBut I don't see it that way, as a mother I cannot understand why I would intentionally surround my sons around two people who really couldn't care for them and who continuously bash their parents. Since then, I have cut off contact and have never been happier, but occasionally receive a message from a relative asking me to contact my parents and let them meet my sons, and my plan to 'make them wait' has gone on long enough.

You are fine. You need to protect your family from hateful people. Can you imagine the crap your dad might say around those kids when they visit and you aren't right there??? \"If your mom had just aborted you...\" - crap like that. Just because someone shares your blood doesn't make them family. Family are the people who love and support you in all that you do (like your grandma, your bf's mum, etc). Those are your family now. You don't need hateful cruel people around.", "NTA at all!! your dad admitted he wanted your babies **dead** - if it were me he would *never* meet them. Stick to your guns mama", "NTA. Unless they are using these other relatives to relay their apologies, they still think they are entitled to your kids without respecting you as their mom.", "NTA\n\nIf the truth about your actions casts you in a bad light, then the problem is not the truth. The problem is your actions. \n\nYour parents expressed that they wanted NOTHING to do with your kids. They were hurtful and cruel. My bet? They only started wanting contact when they could leverage it, or when them not having contact made them look bad. \n\nStay no contact. Stay happy. If your relatives are going to pester you, maybe kindly remind them (feel free to include the screenshots) of what your parents said, how they treated you, that they did not support you. THEY decided not to see your kids. Your kids are not props they get to come crawling back to so they can pretend to be doting grandparents and good people.", "NTA. Being a grandparent is a privilege and not a right. As their mother, you're one of their two sole protectors in the world. This isn't just about physically protecting them but also mentally and emotionally as well. Your parents' actions speak volumes. They could've reached out and apologize for 'heat of the moment' anger and their hurtful messages but they didn't. Instead of apologizing, they aren't acknowledging their actions and instead turning relatives into flying monkeys to shame you into contact. Stay strong. Your twins still have other loving and accepting family members including paternal grandparents.", "NTA. I hope your  inlaws are supportive, loving grandparents", "Ok, they were assholes. \n\nBut unless there is more history here, it is worth giving them a.chance to be better people and meet the twins. \n\nThe fact that your parents were angry that their 21 year old was knocked up with twins, while not admirable, is a little understandable. \n\nOffer them the chance and be explicit that it is an offered chance to be a part of their grandchildren's life, and not a god given right.  \n\nTheir tune may change once they meet them. \n\nIf it doesn't, if they can't let it go, then by all means keep your walls up.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could never trust them to not hurt the children with their words and actions."]}
