I, on the other hand, have shared that I really love my job and it's what I've always worked so hard to achieve.\n\nEver since I started working, Millie have started to ask me for money every now and then (like 50 or 100$) to help her out since I have a stable job with a decent salary I can afford it. I've always accepted and she always pays me back.\n\nLately, I've started to save up money because I'd like to move in bigger flat with my boyfriend, I am still currently living in a students dorm and I'd like to move out by the end of this year. Meanwhile, Millie have been asking me to help her pay her plane tickets so that she could go to holidays with her boyfriend (who lives abroad and works as a streamer and is literally always bragging about how much money he makes). I found it quite weird that she's asking ME instead of her boyfriend to pay for THEIR plane tickets, so I asked him and he gave me a stupid excuse such as \"oh my card got rejected\". Anyway, I didn't wanna make a story out of it and they both started to get offended so I accepted again. I also started to notice on her and her boyfriend's ig accounts how they both buy expensive clothes and shoes (that even I can't afford to buy if I wanted) and started wondering how could she be buying all this stuff if she's having financial problems like she claims to.\n\nYesterday Millie texted me asking if I had an ubereats account, I said yes, she asked if I can give her my account's informations so that she can log in and order herself food because she was \"too lazy to cook dinner tonight\", I said no because it was an account that I share with my boyfriend and I don't feel comfortable sharing our informations with other people so she continued by saying I should then log into her account and save my credit card informations so that she can use it to order herself food whenever she wanted and she'd pay me back after. Obviously I refused because one I am not saving my credit card informations into anyone's account and two I don't think being \"too lazy too cook\" is a valid reason to ask people to pay for you.

Sharing personal financial information is a personal choice, and you have every right to prioritize your privacy and security. It is understandable to feel uncomfortable with sharing such information, especially because it involves your credit card details.\n\nAdditionally, the reason your friend provided (being too lazy to cook) does not seem to warrant asking someone else to pay for her food through their account. It is essential to set boundaries and not enable potentially irresponsible spending habits or dependence on others.\n\nIt is worth considering the pattern of your friend repeatedly asking you for financial assistance. While it's kind-hearted to help out a friend in need, it is also crucial to evaluate whether this assistance is setting a healthy dynamic in your friendship. If you feel the requests are becoming excessive or if you are questioning the validity of her financial situation, it may be worth discussing these concerns with her.\n\nYou are entitled to prioritize your financial goals, such as saving for a bigger flat, without feeling obligated to cover expenses that are not your responsibility", "NTA.
