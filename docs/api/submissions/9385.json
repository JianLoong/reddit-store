You treat him differently because he isn't blood. \n\nHe has every right to be jealous, hurt and sad that your so eager to make your blood related niece feel loved by her favorite uncle.

Sure he's upset, because he's noticed that his uncle clearly doesn't like him. He may have not had a big party, but you ask your niece what she wanted and bought it for her. Did you ask your nephew what he wanted and got it for him? Do you treat them the same? Obviously if the kid made the comment, then I'm guessing \"no\" is your answer.

Also, you say she's \"very social and smart\" so do you not like him because he's the opposite of that? People are different. I'm a very social person, but I'm an ambivert, and some of the greatest people I know are introverts. And \"being smart\" is subjective. Someone may not be academically smart but can be emotionally intelligent, etc. There's different types of intelligence, and knowledge also comes with time. It sounds like you've already made a judgement on your nephew, and now he's paying for it by how little you're willing to give to him vs your niece. \n\nThey are your presents to give, but make the presents closer in quality in the future.

She also had a 2 year old daughter from a previous relationship. Our cousin adopted the daughter. Guess what? Not one of us was ever ugly or rude to that little girl. We accepted her. We love her so much that when our cousin got divorced, we haven\u2019t even realized that she didn\u2019t remember that he wasn\u2019t her biological father and we weren\u2019t her biological family. But it didn\u2019t matter for her or for us. We are family. The whole family treats her and our cousins biological children with his second wife exactly the same. The age gap is exactly the same as OP and his nephew. \n\nSo we can absolutely expect that OP as a young adult could have and should done better.", "When nephew was nieces' age (13), OP would have been 28, so not still a child.", "You are your nieces uncle too. Do you see the hypocrisy here?", "IPad thing aside, saying you never liked your nephew is a fucked up thing to say, unless he was a major asshole to you. He has a right to be pissed because you're spoiling his sibling while you did jack crap for him.", "You had an obligation to treat him fairly, and that extends to not treating your niece in a clearly more favourable way. It's about being an adult and a decent person. You clearly don't factor the effect that your behaviour and decisions have on him, for no good reason, and that makes you an AH.", "Correct.  You do not have an obligation not to be an asshole.", "That\u2019s what we call favoritism.. I think u want to believe you don\u2019t have favorites but you do and that\u2019s a jerk move.. it\u2019s really sad to see people like you who ruin families due to such behavior.. your nephew already feels he isn\u2019t part of the family and your making it so.", "This story is bullshit. I\u2019m calling bullshit. You\u2019re saying a 28 year old man remembers that 15 years ago you bought him a T-shirt for his 13th birthday and he\u2019s still angry enough about this shirt to confront you, and to call you an asshole? Was the T-shirt on fire and you tried to put it on him? Was it made of poo? Did it say \u201cugly adopted kid? Why was this gift so memorable to a man who is now almost 30 that he felt compelled to bring it up a decade and a half later? \n\nConversely, did you buy the niece a 5 bedroom house? Controlling interest in Apple or Google? Dude, this story is faker than my pet Uni the baby unicorn and YTA for that.  BFFR.", "I don't like kids - that makes you an asshole. \n\nThis is equivalent to:\n\n*  I don't like hispanic people\n* I don't like muslims\n* I don't like handicapped people\n\nIt's not OK to just dislike an innocent group of people", "You are a bigger AH than everyone is giving you credit for because of this comment wtf man", "This comment right here makes you the asshole. Why don\u2019t you just admit that you don\u2019t like your nephew and move on.", "Yeah you're totally the AH he's spot on with that.", "Bruh, you should totally just go no contact with your brother, it would help him and his son with the added bonus of hiding how much of a sensitive asshole you are.\n\nOwn up to your mistakes, favoritism, and biased nature you fucking asshole snowflake.", "Why are you even on here? It sounds like you've made up your mind. Are you waiting for someone to agree with you? \n\nAlso, the comparison isn't being made for how you treat them both now. It's how you treated your nephew when he was a child vs. how you treat your niece now. But you know that already.\n\nHowever, if it would appease you, Princess, I'll say you're NTA. I hope you have the life you deserve \u2764", "He wasnt always an adult though was he? You weren't the asshole for not making an effort at 15, but as you matured (although it is questionable whether you did) you should have been engaging better. Really being 15 is not an excuse, there is only 13 years between me and my niece but I have always bought her gifts and treated her the same as my nephew who I am 23 years older than. In fact my nephew I find a bit harder to engage with but I always try my best to take interest. Seems like this boy's biggest crime was being quiet, oh how awful. Or is it really that you are a bigot that doesn't see someone who is adopted as 'real family'?", "Ah\u2026so basically the story is bullshit and your bored.", "A lot of people on AITA use throwaway accounts for just a single purpose, in an attempt to preserve some anonymity.", "He has another fav uncle cause you treat him like crap. Just admit OP, You don't like him because he's not biologically your brother's right?", "He has a favorite uncle and it\u2019s not you because YTA.\n\nYou have a favorite niece/nephew and it\u2019s not him because he\u2019s adopted. \n\nHe can\u2019t control being adopted. What\u2019s your excuse, asshole?", "So by the time you reached adulthood, he would have only been 2-3 years old.\n\nYTA \n\nThis is your nephew, not your buddy. This shouldn\u2019t be a relationship that hinges on whether your personalities are the same or if you have the same interests. It sounds like your nephew is resentful because you treated him differently at age 13 than you treat his sister now.\n\nThis is about way more than the gifts.\n\nI became an aunt when I was 12. You can absolutely have a nephew-uncle relationship with the 15-year age difference. It sounds like you have *chosen* not to.", "You are seriously thick in the head if you still think it is about the IPad.  The abuse you dished out was the utter disdain you obviously had for that literal CHILD.  You say that he should act like an adult but it sounds like you have never acted that mature in your life! I suspect that he has already surpassed you in both maturity and kindness and you can't stand it, so you make a big deal about the child that shares your genes instead.  You are just a jackass who needs to grow the hell up and stop acting like a school bully.", "You didn't provide any reasoning to why you dislike him. All you said was he was a quiet kid when he was adopted. Which doesn't say much", "But the sister didn't exist at that point. So it wasn't about comparison. Most people don't buy expensive gifts for their nieces/nephews.", "That was at the same time. Not 15 years later. \n\n\nMost people are very different at 28 and 43.", "So OP is older and more mature now than he was before. I don't think that makes him an AH, I think that means that 28 years have passed.", "Good for him.", "[deleted]", "Correct. For some reason the ages confused me until OP clarified. Of course a child shouldn\u2019t be expected to give nice gifts to a child, but it sounds like he\u2019s been snubbing him all through his adulthood.", "My oldest niece is adopted and I could never imagine saying or treating her like OP treats his nephew.", "I think I said it in my post", "Do you know how babies are made? That's a conversation you need to have with you parents not me\n\nMy brother is infertile not sterile. There is a difference", "Seriously?  How aren't the terms of a relationship with a niece or nephew completely and utterly voluntary, based on whatever compatibilities you have with them?   What relevance does your choice have to his?  NTA", "How can I like someone who doesn't even talk?", "That is true, but you questioned who remembers gifts they got when they were 13. The answer is kids who are are not treated equally.", "No he openly admits to emotionally treating them differently all their lives and even in his adulthood he doesn't want any connection so actually he's just been an asshole for 28 years", "Except he openly admits it\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t like him and had nothing to do with the made up excuses you\u2019re giving. What are you both in the same room?", "Not sure most 28 yo\u2019s would be buying iPads for their nieces/nephews, but OP was an AH in how he talks about his nephew either way and clearly isn\u2019t treating them with the same degree of love and care now anyway.", "why the fuck are you even posting this? you're an obvious asshole and you know it, you dislike your nephew and always have, you love your niece way more, and you're okay with showing blatant favoritism. so you're the asshole, maybe just accept it an continue on with being a shit uncle to a kid who never did anything wrong to you.", "Yes and because of that you treat them differently and that makes you an asshole. You can justify it however you want and if that makes you happy great, but you are still an asshole.", "You should probably look up the definition of infertile before you make yourself look like more of an ass that you already are.", "Because family isn\u2019t chosen. Friends are. If you are an uncle, grandparent, parent, etc. and you treat a kid differently because they don\u2019t like what you like, then you are shallow and an AH.", "Did you try to talk to him? Or even try to figure out his interests? He was a newly adopted kid who's now starting afresh with a new family. I don't know his past circumstances but maybe he was used to being alone most of the time hence why he didn't speak much. Either that or he was anxious for being around new people.", "If someone has trouble talking, he might have trouble adjusting to his new life. I get it you were a teenager yourself...But you grew up. Have a little empathy now that you are an adult...", "But, at the time, he was just a kid who got a boring gift from his uncle.", "Because family is some kind of \"deep\" value?  I mean, you don't even have the shared gene evolutionary argument in this case.  Want to unpack your deep thinking for me?", "He was one when he was adopted", "I have zero reservations saying the nephew has known his entire life how his uncle feels about him.", "Maybe it was more than just a boring gift? Maybe it wasn\u2019t even a shirt in his style. Maybe it was a shirt that looked like something that was on sale for years. Maybe there was something of the same price that would have been a more suitable gift for a child. \n\nOP was an adult. \n\nMy cousin adopted his first wife\u2019s toddler. You know what, even after the divorce and the whole family not liking the ex wife, that child is still family and is still being treated like family. She is loved for who she is. \n\nOP is suppose to love his brothers children. Regardless of adopted or not. But instead he is basically bragging about how he doesn\u2019t like the one."]}
