On my own, I had saved up enough for a 30% down payment and was getting ready to look into buying a house with a mortgage (I\u2019m starting a PhD program and will need stable housing for the next 5-7 years). When I told them this, my parents very generously offered to help me buy the house in cash. \n\nMy parents are very well off and I acknowledge that I\u2019ve had a very privileged up bringing, but I still try to not draw attention to this so people won\u2019t treat me differently, and I live pretty frugally. At first I denied the offer because I feel bad taking money from my parents. Up until now they\u2019ve only paid for my car and my education (through a college fund). \n\nThey refused to let me refuse and said that they\u2019d rather help me buy the house in cash than have me pay more than what it\u2019s worth in interest. They also didn\u2019t want me to have to worry about affording a mortgage payment on a PhD student\u2019s income. Instead, I will be paying my dad back in fixed monthly payments. The house that I decided on is a very modest size and price, and was even $100k under the budget my parents were willing to help me with. \n\nFast forward to last week, I finally closed and started moving in. I invited some of my close friends over for a housewarming get together.\n\nWhen they got there, one of my friends [27F] asked me how I was able to afford such a \u201cnice\u201d house. I was upfront with her and told her that my parents very generously helped me with it. I didn\u2019t go into detail. \n\nShe then started pressing me pretty hard for more information about my mortgage payments and interest rates, talking about how they\u2019re ridiculously high and it was stupid of me to buy in this economy. I\u2019ll admit that I got annoyed at her continuing to press about this in front of everyone at what was supposed to be a fun, laid back event, so I told her that they helped me buy it in cash and that I\u2019d rather not talk about it anymore.  \n\nShe then goes off on me about how I\u2019m the reason people like her can\u2019t buy a house right now and that it was unfair of me to take the opportunity to get the house away from someone who \u201cneeded it more\u201d by putting in a cash offer. She even went on to insult my parents and my adoption and told me that the only reason I have this life is because my rich parents \u201cbought\u201d me from overseas. \n\nThat last comment was the breaking point for me and I kicked her out of the party. Half of my friends are on my side and the other half said I was too harsh on her and that I should\u2019ve just lied. I\u2019m starting to think I should\u2019ve just lied too, but I also didn\u2019t want to act like I bought the house all on my own, because I didn\u2019t. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit for clarity: I did tell her that I was paying my dad back but that went over her head. In hindsight I could\u2019ve told her that I put down 30% of my own money, but in the heat of the moment I didn\u2019t think of it and I don\u2019t know if that would\u2019ve helped much.

That's a lot of money and I don't know anything else about your situation.  It tells me you're savvy with money.  Either you're very well-off that you can go out AND save up big, or you're a good saver.  Regardless, I commend you.  A lot of people under 40 lack the discipline to cut their spending (no eating out, do meal prep, no going to the bars, drink at home etc).  Guess what, that's not your fault.  People blaming you for their own shortcomings are never going to own a home with that attitude.  Or blaming you because you're \"privileged\" or come from privilege.  \n\nAlso, maybe it's just me, but unless you don't mind answering financial questions for educational purposes, asking someone anything about their financial situation is very rude.

Knowing this friend, she probably still would\u2019ve had something to say about me being able to save 30% to begin with. \n\nShe\u2019s always been weird about random stuff having to do with money and has made comments about my job being \u201cbetter than hers\u201d and stuff before.

People making cash offers are not why the friend can\u2019t buy a house. Cities, counties, and states that have failed to build more in order to address a growing housing problem and individuals who own multiple investment properties are the problem. OP buying a house in cash is not the issue.", "It's not OP's fault they won the adoption lottery, and landed rich parents willing to help their kids by offering a better home loan than the bank.\n\nThere's also a difference between OP's family wealth, and that of the millionaires and billionaires who refuse to pay taxes and hoard homes.", "OP this person is the AH and so not your friend.", "Not just you! I was raised being told that you never ask someone about finances, politics, or religion unless you are genuinely asking to learn something. \n\nAlso thanks for the kind words. It took a whole a lot of strict planning and budgeting, as well as living with my parents for 3 years after I graduated college\u2026 an adventure to say the least but it at least made my mom very happy. \ud83d\ude02", "Looks like OP's friend has an account on reddit", "Also the fact that for years the majority of what is being built are huge 400-500k+ homes.  Which tends to put them out of a large chunk of people's price range.", "There\u2019s also a difference between buying a house to live in, and venture capital firms buying tons of houses to rent to people. That\u2019s who she should actually be mad at, not OP.\n\nNTA, and good luck on your phd program!!", "Right? Like I\u2019m 2 lines adopted, dad and my aunt was adopted and their dad was adopted. I just keep hoping I\u2019m going to get those long lost uncle papers or something. The OP not only has won the lottery, they themselves have lived a frugal enough life to save 30% down on their own. Regardless of the family, OP grinded to afford that much in any area in this economy. Go you OP. Don\u2019t let jealous people ruin your accomplishments.", "Forget about that, there's no need for you to actually have to explain this or that you had saved 30% of what was needed for the house.\n\nAnyone pushing so much on a topic is willing to find something to bug about. NTA, and I read you have a closed circle but really tho, this girl and those who sided with her, you will be better off without.", "That wouldn\u2019t have made the convo go any better if you\u2019d brought up the 30%, etc. She wasn\u2019t trying to understand or listen, she just wanted to tear you down."]}
