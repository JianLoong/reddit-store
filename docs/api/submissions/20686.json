On my own, I had saved up enough for a 30% down payment and was getting ready to look into buying a house with a mortgage (I\u2019m starting a PhD program and will need stable housing for the next 5-7 years). When I told them this, my parents very generously offered to help me buy the house in cash. \n\nMy parents are very well off and I acknowledge that I\u2019ve had a very privileged up bringing, but I still try to not draw attention to this so people won\u2019t treat me differently, and I live pretty frugally. At first I denied the offer because I feel bad taking money from my parents. Up until now they\u2019ve only paid for my car and my education (through a college fund). \n\nThey refused to let me refuse and said that they\u2019d rather help me buy the house in cash than have me pay more than what it\u2019s worth in interest. They also didn\u2019t want me to have to worry about affording a mortgage payment on a PhD student\u2019s income. Instead, I will be paying my dad back in fixed monthly payments. The house that I decided on is a very modest size and price, and was even $100k under the budget my parents were willing to help me with. \n\nFast forward to last week, I finally closed and started moving in. I invited some of my close friends over for a housewarming get together.\n\nWhen they got there, one of my friends [27F] asked me how I was able to afford such a \u201cnice\u201d house. I was upfront with her and told her that my parents very generously helped me with it. I didn\u2019t go into detail. \n\nShe then started pressing me pretty hard for more information about my mortgage payments and interest rates, talking about how they\u2019re ridiculously high and it was stupid of me to buy in this economy. I\u2019ll admit that I got annoyed at her continuing to press about this in front of everyone at what was supposed to be a fun, laid back event, so I told her that they helped me buy it in cash and that I\u2019d rather not talk about it anymore.  \n\nShe then goes off on me about how I\u2019m the reason people like her can\u2019t buy a house right now and that it was unfair of me to take the opportunity to get the house away from someone who \u201cneeded it more\u201d by putting in a cash offer. She even went on to insult my parents and my adoption and told me that the only reason I have this life is because my rich parents \u201cbought\u201d me from overseas. \n\nThat last comment was the breaking point for me and I kicked her out of the party. Half of my friends are on my side and the other half said I was too harsh on her and that I should\u2019ve just lied. I\u2019m starting to think I should\u2019ve just lied too, but I also didn\u2019t want to act like I bought the house all on my own, because I didn\u2019t. \n\nSo, am I the asshole here?\n\nEdit for clarity: I did tell her that I was paying my dad back but that went over her head. In hindsight I could\u2019ve told her that I put down 30% of my own money, but in the heat of the moment I didn\u2019t think of it and I don\u2019t know if that would\u2019ve helped much.

That's a lot of money and I don't know anything else about your situation.  It tells me you're savvy with money.  Either you're very well-off that you can go out AND save up big, or you're a good saver.  Regardless, I commend you.  A lot of people under 40 lack the discipline to cut their spending (no eating out, do meal prep, no going to the bars, drink at home etc).  Guess what, that's not your fault.  People blaming you for their own shortcomings are never going to own a home with that attitude.  Or blaming you because you're \"privileged\" or come from privilege.  \n\nAlso, maybe it's just me, but unless you don't mind answering financial questions for educational purposes, asking someone anything about their financial situation is very rude.

Knowing this friend, she probably still would\u2019ve had something to say about me being able to save 30% to begin with. \n\nShe\u2019s always been weird about random stuff having to do with money and has made comments about my job being \u201cbetter than hers\u201d and stuff before.

And the venomous comments about being adopted are way over the line. \n\nNTA", "And companies purchasing houses for short term rentals. \n\nThere are multiple factors, but cash offers are not one of them.", "The housing crisis(plural) is such a complex **macro** problem, that any individual purchasing a property to live in isn't moving the needle in any direction.", "Maybe get some friends that do come from money, instead of having to 'act' differently.  There is actually a reason why certain groups tend to gather.  This is a perfect example.  Someone who came from money wouldn't ask such crass questions.", "Don't apologise for kicking out someone disrespecting and attacking you in your own home.", "FWIW builders are businesses, not charities.  Unless they're forced to build tract homes by local ordinance, they're going to build whatever maximizes their own profit.  If that means $500k 4 bed, 2.5 bath with a 2 car garage ($750k for that in my area, and they fly off the market as fast as they're listed), so be it.\n\nVote in local elections people.", "That\u2019s what\u2019s selling because the cost of materials has gone up a ton too. It doesn\u2019t make sense fiscally for the builders to make one bedroom houses that are affordable because no one wants a one bedroom house anymore. People want 3-5 bedrooms and that hikes up the price considerably even just in materials, so the half million dollar starter home McMansion is the norm around where I live now. It\u2019s sad but it is a business and they\u2019re not sitting empty.", "I don't know if it's because the last few generations are just getting poorer and poorer, but it's like we have forgotten you're *supposed* to get help from your parents.\n  \nEveryone I knew growing up that was successful had mild help from their parents. Free place to stay in college, paid for their wedding, helped with/bought their first house.", "Seriously! I went to a law school that has a lot of rich kids, even for a law school. I\u2019m a first gen college grad. Law school was a joint effort between me and my husband. \n\nSome of my closest friends at school came from very wealthy backgrounds. Parents paid for their education flat out. It\u2019s been over ten years and my loan amount is still higher than my mortgage. \n\nSure, in a very real sense I was envious as hell. That first semester we couldn\u2019t afford delivery pizza unless my mother in law sent us some money. But it never even crossed my mind to be snarky to my rich kid friends. They had as much to do with their lot in life as I did mine.", "Every single person I know around my age that has a house had help buying it. I\u2019m very glad for them and grateful they acknowledge it\u2019s basically impossible to get a house without help these days.", "It\u2019s nice to have friends like that. Nowadays all my friends just want to cheat off of me on the exams and I and they have been caught a number of times and they still refuse to not cheat off of me.", "N T A.  My father did a similar thing for me but it was more of a paper transaction.   \n\nI was renting a flat from my friend but they needed to sell ASAP.  Instantly I tried to get a mortgage but I had a bad credit rating rating,  so dad released some equity from his house whilst simultaneously organising a buy to let mortgage.  He paid for the flat in cash but because I was already a tenant I got a discount on the sale price.  So when the mortgage money came through, dad profited hugely.  Sale price was 110,000 gbp but mortgage mortgage money came in at 138,000 gbp so after costs he made 20,000 gbp on a paper transaction. \n\nSo I got a beautiful flat with a discounted mortgage and Dad was able to make some money in the process too.\n\nBut I didn't tell anyone about how the transaction played out, because I knew from how my friends were, they wouldn't be happy for me.  But I knew how lucky I was and properly maintained the flat structurally and decorated it beautifully.  Thanks Dad xx", "Exactly! My dad said he would rather help set me up for the future now and see me succeed than see me struggle in any way when he had the means to help.", "Truth! After my parents divorced my dad lived with my grandparents for like 7 years before he bought his house. And we can\u2019t forget that everything was insanely less expensive back in the day."]}
