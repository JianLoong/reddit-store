So, for Christmas Eve, I had a really great dinner with lots of food for everyone to take home leftovers.\n\nChristmas at my in-laws - they are really bad at remembering I'm lactose intolerant. They do know, but they have their traditional dishes that they make every year and they refuse to make them differently, which is fine! I don't want to make anyone not get what they're wanting just because I can't have it.

Ok you can starve. We know you have food issues,. But we don't care. It's rude to bring your own food. Don't you know your supposed to sit there and starve and watch us stuff our face.
