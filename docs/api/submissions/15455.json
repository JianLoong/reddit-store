We\u2019re friends with a couple who are together about 2 years, Jason & Ann. (Not real names.) Jason & my bf are housemates. Jason & Ann had talked about having kids but thought there might be some issues around getting pregnant so it was a \u201cin the near future\u201d conversation. But Ann is now pregnant & they\u2019re delighted - & I\u2019m delighted for them. They\u2019re now house-hunting, but our city is in a housing crisis atm so finding anywhere is a nightmare. Jason is handy & would be happy to renovate a house himself but obviously on with a baby on the way there\u2019s more time pressure on the situation. I own a small house, & my bf has owned his house for a few years. I\u2019ve told Jason & Ann that if they haven\u2019t found the right house before the baby is due or if their renovation takes longer than ideal, I\u2019d be happy for them to take over my house for a few months so they can have a place to themselves & feel a bit settled when the baby gets here. My bf is happy for me to stay with him, or my sister lives near & I could stay with her, so I\u2019ll be fine. I think my bf & I are very lucky to both own houses & am happy to help people I love if they need a place for a while.\n\nBut since Ann got pregnant & I offered the house, she\u2019s been asking if my bf & I are going to live in together & have kids literally every time I see her. I love my bf & want to be with him for a very long time, but I have a history of abusive relationships that took a long time to recover from & am just enjoying being happy & healthy again. I\u2019m not trying to rush anything, & my bf hasn\u2019t brought it up either, so we haven\u2019t really had these conversations yet. I definitely don\u2019t want to officially, permanently move in together out of default just because his housemate is moving out - I want it to be when we\u2019re both ready to & really want to, & right now I\u2019m happy enjoying my space.\n\nBut Ann keeps asking, & has started making comments like \u201cYou\u2019re the last couple in our friend group [to not be living together/having a kid.]\u201d I\u2019m finding it a bit weird because she & I never really had those chats before but since getting pregnant she\u2019s brought it up several times. She did again this week & I was being honest & said I had stuff I wanted to do before possibly having kids, like renting out my house & go travelling for a few months/a year, & that I didn\u2019t want to live with my bf out of default. I laughed at her a little & said it hadn\u2019t taken her long to start pressuring me to get pregnant. \n\nShe got a bit huffy & started saying \u201cmust be nice to be able to go off [travelling]\u201d & said something like \u201cWe\u2019re in our 30s, you should be getting serious about these conversations.\n\nI feel like she was getting defensive & judging me when I\u2019m being as supportive as I can, but I also don\u2019t think we need to do the same things??", "created_utc": 1682191136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12vg7c9/aita_for_talking_about_travel_plans_laughing_at_a/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I've had friends who had kids and turned like this in a heartbeat- \"OOh when are you having them?\" \"Wow, sure is NICE to not have responsibilities!\" \"Bit unfair that YOU get to travel whenever you want.\"\n\nLike, she's pregnant. And that can do all sorts of crazy shit to your emotions (hormones are powerful lil things), so I would be willing to bet that at least some of this is coming from there. That being said- her comments are rude and unasked for. It's none of her business and, if I was you, I would tell her to worry about her own damn kid and stop asking me about mine. Tho, I am biased, as I am child free (by choice, although having children would potentially be hard for me) and I have gotten a LOT of grief about that choice from people in my life who have become parents.", "NTA\u2014 sounds like she\u2019s jealous that you\u2019re not also about to have to deal with a screaming baby and no place to live. Sucks to suck.", "NTA. I feel like it's either jealousy, or she's anxious about the temporary arrangement ending once your plans come into fruition, so her way of making sure it stays permanent is pressuring you into a more serious commitment in your relationship.\n\nDon't mind her. It's very condescending and invasive of her to give you these comments, especially if as you say it's not something you talk about amongst yourselves normally, and even more so when you've been so generous to her.", "NTA.  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.  Another redditor mentioned getting a lease agreement on paper. It sounds like she's trying to push you out of your own house.", "NTA!! Oh my goodness, NTA! It sounds like the gravity of Ann\u2019s situation is sitting in and well, misery loves company. I applaud you for knowing what you want and being responsible with your life choices. I\u2019d tell her that jealousy is not a good look on her and that these are pretty judgmental comments coming from a pregnant woman with no proper living conditions for said baby.", "Having children means saying goodbye to certain freedoms.

You're allowed to make your own decisions with your SO and with travelling, it isn't your fault if she compares her situation to yours.

It might ruin the friendship.", "NTA but she\u2019s going to be a monster tenant. You might want to re-think your kind offer", "NTA. She probably has nesting emotions and feels everyone would want to be in her situation. You have been very kind so far. I would just repeat that you and your boyfriend are happy in your current situation and you are happy that she and her boyfriend are happy in theirs.

Make sure you have her sign a lease agreement thats very precise, cus I think she will be either a difficult tenant or difficult to get her to leave", "NTA at all but your \"friend\" sure is. Firstly, she sounds really ungrateful for your generosity given how she is happy to judge you easily. Secondly, her resenting you for having the freedom to travel is ridiculous because... I'm going to be blunt here... it was her choice to have unprotected sex and her choice to keep her pregnancy. If she wanted that freedom for just a bit longer, she should've made different life choices.\n\nThirdly... and most importantly here, for all to see (which gets its own paragraph)... *never* ask someone if and when they are planning on having kids. People are entitled to be child free by choice, but these questions can be hugely triggering. She doesn't know your personal life in great detail. You could've been trying for a while and have fertility issues, you could've gotten pregnant and miscarried, or have had some other issues for all she knew. Society need to stop challenging people on their parenthood status because it isn't appropriate or acceptable.\n\nFor anyone blaming her behaviour on her pregnancy- can we also stop giving people allowances for being AHs just because they are pregnant... pregnancy doesn't affect morality and being hormonal is no excuse for being hurtful towards others. Pregnant people are not immune from being called AHs, nor immune from doing the right thing.", "Bingo.", "Yes! Starting this crap now before they move in?!

Definitely definitely have her sign a proper lease agreement to protect yourself.", "Landlord here, please don't do this. They're going to scam you out of your house. You may not be able to evict them depending on the state.
