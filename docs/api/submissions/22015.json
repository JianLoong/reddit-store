I wasn't at home so I said I don't know but he doesnt seem like the guy to cheat.

I think in the time they were together me and her had maybe 4 conversations if that. \n\nIt ended up coming to light that my brother had in fact been cheating on her for the last few months wirh a girl from work, who I see and talk to all the time.

You acted politely keeping your opinions to yourself which again very commendable as to not make a scene. \n\nNew GF doesn't have a reason to leave the job so likelihood is if you feel uncomfortable you will end up having to move occupation, I'm sorry but tis the way.\n\nYou can be both happy for someone and disappointed in them for their past.", "The right place to vent because there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling this way but in the end your brother is the one who has to live with his actions. Does his current gf know she was the side chick while he was engaged?", "NTA but that's because I am biased and also am disgusted by my brother who decided to leave his wife because \"she is fat and dont love her anymore\" and then proceed to (prety sure it was before he separated) hook up with a new chick who is a replica of what his wife looked like 20 years ago. \n\nNew chick is considered family, they live together and we all just gotta deal with it. \n\nLong story short, I don't talk to my brother anymore but we were never very close.\n\nYou have every right to feel how you feel. I guess you can still be polite without going above and beyond to act like everything is super happy la la?", "NTA. You are free to not approve of his relationship or have any kind of relationship with his new girlfriend. Just keep in mind that he doesn\u2019t NEED your approval, he can be in any kind of relationship he wants with whomever he wants.", "I was fully prepared to call you the a hole but NTA. I wish one person would have stood up to my cheating ex husband. My family even picked him over me. He is on his second divorce, 5th child with the 4th woman\u2026 that\u2019s who they picked and now 15 years later mu family relationship is irreparable\u2026. \n\nCheating has consequences and those can be absolutely devastating for the person on the other end, like my example.

Based on limited info. \n\nYour brother should have just broken up, and not cheated, it's not hard to leave in a lot of these.  I can see where he would try to find some kind of escape, but just leave. Also to just bring the new girl around asap is tacky, he needs to wait a bit.\n\nYou suck because this isn't about you at all. There's a double edge sword here, but, you don't seem close like that, so your interaction with his ex fiance and now the new girlfriend doesn't really matter. Your approval of any of this doesn't really matter.  \n\nThis stings primarily because of the death. His ex fiance called you, whom she's never really spoken to before and broke some bad news to you in order to find your brother. She pulled you into a situation you would have never been in directly in the first place. This is a an issue you really need to look into", "NTA. Your brother is the AH. I\u2019d cut my brother out of my life as much as possible. If the new gf knew he was in a relationship then she\u2019s also an AH. Doesn\u2019t matter how miserable he was with his fianc\u00e9. He chose to cheat and not break up right away.", "NTA. Your feelings are understandable, and the fact that you are actively considering how to handle this, before acting out towards them is the exact opposite of being an asshole, I'd say.\n\nI would talk to him about it and explain how you feel. It seems like you are happy for him and understand why he's not with his fianc\u00e9e anymore, but you are unhappy about how he's gone about it and feel a bit betrayed because you didn't know this was going on. If he agrees that he handled this quite shitty, you can probably move on (and hope he's learned from the experience).  If he gets defensive and doesn't understand your point of view, I'd say you have more work to do (or conclude that you have conflicting morals).", "NTA on one condition - its fine to feel this way, i would too. but you cant do anything about it. if you told your brother you didnt like the relationship or whatever without him asking what you think, then YTA. but otherwise, feelings are fine", "Gently, YTA. It is his relationships, his choices. Would you he rather been fateful and miserable, got married and then divorsed? Are you putting him on a pedestal and only now realizing he is human and makes mistakes too? What is your disappointment and what are your priorities - is it that he is some knight in shining armor, perfect big brother picture, or is it that you love him and you want him to be happy in a relationship that fits him? Even if you don't understand his choices, your first thought should be - what does it matter more for you: your brother or your morals. And that is considering his relationship is not a threat to your morals, you don't have to compromise anything or do anything.", "NTA. His behaviour was deplorable, and it\u2019s natural for a right thinking person such as yourself to react this way. \n\nKarma will find his new girlfriend, as he\u2019ll probably cheat on her too.", "NTA, He was happy and free 2 years ago too, probably will be happy with a new girl in a year. Doesnt change the fact that he is a cheating AH.", "NTA.  If he was unhappy he should have either tried to work it out with her or broken it off. You got enough time to cheat, then you got enough time to break it off with the person you're cheating on.

Lying, cheating, crushing someone\u2019s self esteem while their father was dying? Someone should tell him he is a class A Asshole and his future is bleak given his behavior. You can refer to my example above. Ex husband never prospered bc he cheated so many times and has so many different children with different women that no one likes or respects him. His own son despises him.", "Honestly, I understand that cheating hurts people, but it's also extremely common in unhappy relationships. Sure, your brother should have been honest, but this kind of thing happens all the time and it doesn't make your brother an awful person really. Do you have trauma from being cheated on or something? Monogamy is kind of a new thing in the scale of human history. It's natural to be attracted to a variety of people. I have a feeling your brother's ex-fiance might secretly be relieved that they aren't getting married, she was probably unhappy with the relationship as well. It's a good thing that they didn't end up in an unhappy marriage. You should be happy for both of them in a way.", "I wouldn\u2019t bet against you.", "Yeah exactly, like the girl is lovely and when she's on her own I treat her as a friend amd we get on really well. it was just I think seeing them together as like an official couple, that just started up all this like anger?? again\n\nShes really funny and really nice, and my brother has always been really kind and sweet, but its just kind of ruined my perception of them both", "Well I have my own issues with an ex partner but he never cheated on me, but I always had the fail safe of well at least my brothers would never do anything like that to a girl. And then one of them goes and cheats on a girl he planned to spend his life with. Just kicks me a bit becuase it also makes me think of what other stuff would he do in a relationship that I think he wouldn't. I dont know if that makes sense or not. \n\nI'm happy that he's happy but I'm not happy with what he did and he doesnt seem to feel remorseful for it, like he knows it was bad and he should have dont it differently, but he does act very nonchalantly about it all and isn't guilty about it", "That doesn't makes it okay.

I'm just saying, her brother is not necessarily an asshole either. It's not black and white. OP's brother was engaged to someone he wasn't compatible with. He was unhappy. She was materialistic and didn't like his family. He should have ended the engagement before seeing other people, definitely. But, for probably a multitude of reasons, that was difficult. We don't know all the details in this situation, but I know plenty of people who got engaged not necessarily because they were super compatible with each other but because \"well, we're almost 30 and we've been together for a few years, my girlfriend wants a ring.\" Even though there are lots of red flags in the relationship. I mean, who knows. It takes 2 to have a shitty relationship. I just feel like, despite the cheating, if her brother is in a happier relationship now with someone he's more compatible with, that's not such a bad thing. Also, his ex-fianc\u00e9 sounded like a bummer so, perhaps this is an overall positive thing. At least they didn't get married and then realize they weren't happy. I've seen people do that too and it's much messier to divorce then to break off an engagement. I dunno, open your mind a little. I hope that OP will give her brother a little slack and not let this get in the way of having a relationship with him. If he's happy, that's  much better than a miserable marriage.", "Mmm... I would argue that actually, polyamorous or open relationships are becoming a lot more popular lately. I know plenty of people in happy, open relationships. Monogamy isn't the only option in life. \n\nPeople in monogamous relationships should be honest with each other though. I do think that OP'S brother should have told his ex that he was unhappy and that he wanted to end the engagement before he started seeing his new GF.", "NTA. You should do nothing and take some time to process this. If he was so unhappy in the relationship with ex fianc\u00e9 he should have broken up with her. Instead, he decided to waste both of their time and cheat on his ex.", "Your brother has put you in a very difficult position at work which is very selfish of him. I applaud your self control in not being drawn into the drama it\u2019s caused at work because these things always do.  As for being comfortable around the new GF with family, that\u2019s a tough one to navigate. Obviously they\u2019re both cheaters and you can state your case about his ex being horrible all you want but it doesn\u2019t change the fact that he cheated instead of doing the right thing and ending things before cheating. The incident when her father died is a prime example. The EX had every right to expect her SO to be available in her time of need. Wouldn\u2019t you if it were you? He was still in a committed relationship and still engaged to her. Now he\u2019s justifying his cheating with tales of how horrible she was to him. That\u2019s kind of straight from the cheater\u2019s handbook to tell the truth. \n\nYou\u2019ve chosen to take the high road which is very commendable but don\u2019t ever discount your own feelings here. People may say that you\u2019re going to get over it but I don\u2019t think you should. I think that you might need to rethink your feelings for the both of them from now on and keep your guard up because you now know what they\u2019re capable of. Don\u2019t get sucked into the gossip machine at work either. Just say you don\u2019t have an opinion and firmly leave it there. It\u2019s not fair that their actions have made YOUR work environment more toxic through no fault of your own.

And I just feel like if I fully support them then im not a good person?? it seems really stupid and like I said im not attacking him or making his life hard, even when I found out about the cheating I took him out for food and I let him say his piece instead of being rude and horrible about it.\n\nI understand its a complex situation especially as I work with the woman. But in my head I have this view that couples who start with cheating never end happily so im also kind of worried of what this relationship could bring for him. I mean the new girl he is dating clearly thought it was okay for him to cheat on his fianc\u00e8 otherwise she wouldn't have done anything, so whose to say the exact same problem won't occur", "It's good that you understand this is your perception of the world, your opinion and your feelings here. \n\nAbout your worries about his relationship (this relationship, future problems, etc) - it's their choice. Both of them are aware of the conditions under which their relationship started, so there is nothing for you to be concerned about - \"what if he cheats on her?\", \"what if she cheats on him?\", \"what if they end up unhappy and break up?\" is all out of your control and entirely up to them. Do you think either of them will come to you to look for emotional support so this will somehow turn into \"your\" problem? I doubt it, since they kept the relationship from you and your brother was never comfortable enough to confide in you about his struggles with his fiancee. \n\nSo maybe the real issue here is how you feel for the possibility of \"what if they end up happy and together\" and that conflicting with your ideas that \"couples who start with cheating never end up happily\"?", "but that is just more excuses for breaking the trust of someone...\n\nNo it doesn't take 2 people to cheat. That is just plain victim blaming. WTF.\n\nOPs brother being happy is a good thing for him. But if we excuse bad moral things with happiness everyone would get away with stealing a PS5. Cause that would make me happy too.\n\nI hope OP and her brother can fix their relationship. Its on him thought to show he can be trusted. Else he is just a dick who goes around hurting other people.", "I mean I am glad they didn't get married, and it's not as if I dislike my brother or anything. I guess I'm more just dissapointed in the fact that he did this? Especially having a younger sister as a sibling becuase I can gurantee if I told him my partner cheated on me, he would go to the guys house and knock him out. Like I said im glad he is now happy but there is just part of me that doesn't like the new relationship, even tho his new girl seems quite pleasant", "Polyamory isn\u2019t cheating, though. I personally don\u2019t understand having multiple partners, but I\u2019m not going to judge. So far as I understand it, in open relationships both partners are aware of and consent to other relationships. This isn\u2019t that.", "He actually did mention that earlier this year he mentioned to his fianc\u00e8 that he wanted things to change or to end the relationship before it became toxic. But I guess nothing ever happened from it and then he just never found the \"right time\" to end it off with her", "I feel like you're misunderstanding me. I don't mean that it was his ex fianc\u00e9's fault he cheated. I meant if her brother was unhappy, it's likely his ex-fianc\u00e9 was unhappy as well. He should have told his ex he was unhappy before moving on to another relationship, definitely. I hope that OP and her brother can talk this out too.", "It's totally understandable. You're not an asshole. Your brother should have ended his engagement before starting a new relationship but I hope you can talk it out with him and move past this. Maybe the new gf is actually a better match for him. I hope you will all get along. It is risky that he started dating someone at work though... like... this could also end up being very awkward if they eventually break up later.", "Yes... that's why I agreed and said OP'S brother should have been honest. Honesty is essential in any type of relationship.", "Ah yes, on rereading your post I see that we do agree!"]}
