At the start of the year he started a new job where I now work aswell and I get on very well with all our colleagues and its pretty fun.\n\nA few weeks ago I got a call from my brothers now ex fianc\u00e8 asking me if he was cheating and wanting to know his whereabouts. I wasn't at home so I said I don't know but he doesnt seem like the guy to cheat. And in all fairness, it isn't like him at all, when he's in a relationship he makes that girl his entire world and I didnt really see any change in his behaviour around her.\nBare in mind now, the fianc\u00e8s dad has just died if a very quick very sudden illness which caught all of us by suprise.\n\nI never really got on with my brothers fianc\u00e8 as she never made an effort to hang out or try and talk to us (didn't really want anything to do with us) and would constantly reject our advances to get to know her better. I think in the time they were together me and her had maybe 4 conversations if that. \n\nIt ended up coming to light that my brother had in fact been cheating on her for the last few months wirh a girl from work, who I see and talk to all the time. Its completely ruined my perception of her because she was always so nice and lovely (maybe in an attempt to butter me up?) but I now just can't look at her the same. I'm not rude or mean to her becuase it's not my life its nit my relationship and if my brother is happy then whatever. But there's part of me that just feels so disgusted by the whole thing.\n\nApparantly my brother was round this girls house when his soon to be late father in law passed away and his ex fianc\u00e8 tried calling him to no avail. Which just makes the whole situation so much worse.\n\nI have tried talking to him about it to understand why, and in kind of his defence he was never truly happy in that relationship, she was very materialistic, she didn't like our side of the family, and they never did anything relationship like to the point where my brother just started feeling like a friend or colleague to her as he always was just helping her with work. \n\nWe had a bbq the other day round my house and my brother brought his new gf (the one he cheated on his fianc\u00e8 with) and I just felt so upset by it. I was nice and friendly to them but just part of me can't get on board and fully support this relationship.\n\nI think what makes it worse is the fact a lot of people at work knew about it, someone even tried to talk to me about it the other night and ask for my opinions, and it just makes me feel gross and a bit ashamed.\n\nSorry for the long post, it's a bit of a vent. But AITA for feeling this way as my brother is now finally happy and feels free?

You acted politely keeping your opinions to yourself which again very commendable as to not make a scene. \n\nNew GF doesn't have a reason to leave the job so likelihood is if you feel uncomfortable you will end up having to move occupation, I'm sorry but tis the way.\n\nYou can be both happy for someone and disappointed in them for their past.", "The right place to vent because there\u2019s nothing wrong with feeling this way but in the end your brother is the one who has to live with his actions. Does his current gf know she was the side chick while he was engaged?", "NTA but that's because I am biased and also am disgusted by my brother who decided to leave his wife because \"she is fat and dont love her anymore\" and then proceed to (prety sure it was before he separated) hook up with a new chick who is a replica of what his wife looked like 20 years ago. \n\nNew chick is considered family, they live together and we all just gotta deal with it. \n\nLong story short, I don't talk to my brother anymore but we were never very close.\n\nYou have every right to feel how you feel. I guess you can still be polite without going above and beyond to act like everything is super happy la la?", "NTA. You are free to not approve of his relationship or have any kind of relationship with his new girlfriend. Just keep in mind that he doesn\u2019t NEED your approval, he can be in any kind of relationship he wants with whomever he wants.", "I was fully prepared to call you the a hole but NTA. I wish one person would have stood up to my cheating ex husband. My family even picked him over me. He is on his second divorce, 5th child with the 4th woman\u2026 that\u2019s who they picked and now 15 years later mu family relationship is irreparable\u2026. \n\nCheating has consequences and those can be absolutely devastating for the person on the other end, like my example. Took my dignity, self-confidence, and my family. The pig didn\u2019t even want any of that, took it anyway.", "I'll say ESH. Based on limited info. \n\nYour brother should have just broken up, and not cheated, it's not hard to leave in a lot of these.  I can see where he would try to find some kind of escape, but just leave. Also to just bring the new girl around asap is tacky, he needs to wait a bit.\n\nYou suck because this isn't about you at all. There's a double edge sword here, but, you don't seem close like that, so your interaction with his ex fiance and now the new girlfriend doesn't really matter. Your approval of any of this doesn't really matter.  \n\nThis stings primarily because of the death. His ex fiance called you, whom she's never really spoken to before and broke some bad news to you in order to find your brother. She pulled you into a situation you would have never been in directly in the first place. This is a an issue you really need to look into", "NTA. Your brother is the AH. I\u2019d cut my brother out of my life as much as possible. If the new gf knew he was in a relationship then she\u2019s also an AH. Doesn\u2019t matter how miserable he was with his fianc\u00e9. He chose to cheat and not break up right away.", "NTA. Your feelings are understandable, and the fact that you are actively considering how to handle this, before acting out towards them is the exact opposite of being an asshole, I'd say.\n\nI would talk to him about it and explain how you feel. It seems like you are happy for him and understand why he's not with his fianc\u00e9e anymore, but you are unhappy about how he's gone about it and feel a bit betrayed because you didn't know this was going on. If he agrees that he handled this quite shitty, you can probably move on (and hope he's learned from the experience).  If he gets defensive and doesn't understand your point of view, I'd say you have more work to do (or conclude that you have conflicting morals).", "NTA on one condition - its fine to feel this way, i would too. but you cant do anything about it. if you told your brother you didnt like the relationship or whatever without him asking what you think, then YTA. but otherwise, feelings are fine", "Gently, YTA. It is his relationships, his choices. Would you he rather been fateful and miserable, got married and then divorsed? Are you putting him on a pedestal and only now realizing he is human and makes mistakes too? What is your disappointment and what are your priorities - is it that he is some knight in shining armor, perfect big brother picture, or is it that you love him and you want him to be happy in a relationship that fits him? Even if you don't understand his choices, your first thought should be - what does it matter more for you: your brother or your morals. And that is considering his relationship is not a threat to your morals, you don't have to compromise anything or do anything.", "NTA. His behaviour was deplorable, and it\u2019s natural for a right thinking person such as yourself to react this way. \n\nKarma will find his new girlfriend, as he\u2019ll probably cheat on her too.", "NTA, He was happy and free 2 years ago too, probably will be happy with a new girl in a year. Doesnt change the fact that he is a cheating AH.", "NTA.  If he was unhappy he should have either tried to work it out with her or broken it off. You got enough time to cheat, then you got enough time to break it off with the person you're cheating on. And the fact that he was still out getting his dick wet when his fianc\u00e9 was going through a horrible loss is especially shitty.", "NTA. I have been in OP\u2019s shoes (more recently) and been in the new gf\u2019s shoes (10+ years ago). I don\u2019t hold it against anyone for anything they thought badly of me back in the day, and I\u2019m actively working to let go of disgusted feelings for someone close to me\u2026because 1) it\u2019s hypocritical and 2) what\u2019s the saying? Alls fair in love and war. But never totally feels that way, right? It\u2019s your brothers life, let him do him. You do you.

The fact that his fianc\u00e9 tried calling him when she just lost her dad, and he was actively cheating, really speaks about his character.

What a disgusting human being.", "NTA but don\u2019t take your feelings out on the new girl because she honestly may have not known that he was already in a relationship.

And then to hear that he's gone and cheated on his fianc\u00e8 just makes me feel a bit sick", "Its more that I don't want to be making his life harder and that I don't really want to be fake / 2 faced about it. Its never easy when siblings don't get on with partners so I don't want to make it a bad situation for him", "Yeah because that's the thing is that a lot people I now work with, knew that he was having an affair. And not one of them thought to bring it up to his fianc\u00e8 or even myself, not even talk to them to tell them it was wrong. I dont know about anyone on here but if my partner was cheating on me and the people he worked with knew, even if they don't know me I would still appreciate then telling me about it", "Yeah I dont think I want to mention it to him as I'm sure he's going to be getting a lot of judgement throughout his life for it and I dont want to make it any harder for him", "Agreed its his relationship his choices, but part of making choices is accepting the burden of them. \n\nHe chose to not be honest with his partner and instead seek out attention from someone else. Regardless of circumstance no one deserves to be cheated on. \n\nBut to make a decision like that and say your an AH for having an opinion about it is just wrong. She isn't looking to hurt him just wanting validation for the thoughts and feelings that she has. \n\nIf I found out that a close family member of mine was cheating on their partner my opinion about them certainly would change despite however much I try not to allow it to.", "I think its more the fact that I'm just so against cheating and I'm so upset that my brother would do this.

Give him the chance to respond. \" Brother, I love you, and I am happy for you if you are happy in this relationship. But I do not condone the way you did it. It was not fair to your ex partner. You should have broken up before getting into a new relationship. No matter how she was to you or to our family, she did have the right to know.\"\n\nAnd if he dismisses you, that is his true colors.

Current GF also had a boyfriend at the time, who she left when it all came out. Her and my brother have been together for 5 years now.\n\nIt gave me the ICK, because it's girl code not to do that and I didn't like her for a good while.\n\nThey've been together years now and he is happier with her than he was with Ex.\n\nI don't dislike her as a person, she's nice, smart and makes my brother happy, which as a sibling is all I can ask. I dislike that she hurt exGF as it was such a shitty choice she made but it's not my place to get involved.\n\nMy relationship with my brother was more important than my dislike for her actions. \n\nBut it took a while to get over it because it went against every moral I have.\n\nIs your ick of this girl worth potentially losing your brother over?\n\nx", "Perhaps the people at work assumed you knew? Did coworkers know from observation or were they confided in by your brother or his girlfriend?", "You should though. Cheating is a personality flaw. If he did this once, sweetie he will do this again. He will do it when someone is his wife. People who cheat really don\u2019t seem to feel things the same way we do and they\u2019re VERY entitled. Lying, cheating, crushing someone\u2019s self esteem while their father was dying? Someone should tell him he is a class A Asshole and his future is bleak given his behavior. You can refer to my example above. Ex husband never prospered bc he cheated so many times and has so many different children with different women that no one likes or respects him. His own son despises him.", "Honestly, I understand that cheating hurts people, but it's also extremely common in unhappy relationships. Sure, your brother should have been honest, but this kind of thing happens all the time and it doesn't make your brother an awful person really. Do you have trauma from being cheated on or something? Monogamy is kind of a new thing in the scale of human history. It's natural to be attracted to a variety of people. I have a feeling your brother's ex-fiance might secretly be relieved that they aren't getting married, she was probably unhappy with the relationship as well. It's a good thing that they didn't end up in an unhappy marriage. You should be happy for both of them in a way.", "I wouldn\u2019t bet against you.", "Yeah exactly, like the girl is lovely and when she's on her own I treat her as a friend amd we get on really well. it was just I think seeing them together as like an official couple, that just started up all this like anger?? again\n\nShes really funny and really nice, and my brother has always been really kind and sweet, but its just kind of ruined my perception of them both", "Well I have my own issues with an ex partner but he never cheated on me, but I always had the fail safe of well at least my brothers would never do anything like that to a girl. And then one of them goes and cheats on a girl he planned to spend his life with. Just kicks me a bit becuase it also makes me think of what other stuff would he do in a relationship that I think he wouldn't. I dont know if that makes sense or not. \n\nI'm happy that he's happy but I'm not happy with what he did and he doesnt seem to feel remorseful for it, like he knows it was bad and he should have dont it differently, but he does act very nonchalantly about it all and isn't guilty about it", "That doesn't makes it okay. Most people break up before they sleep with others. Brother is an AH. OP is not an AH for having decency and morals.\n\nWhat a weird comment full of cheating excuses.", "Not using our appendix or wisdom teeth is also relatively new in human history, as well. We\u2019re evolving away from it.", "It's really shitty to be in this position.\n\nI struggled for months seeing them together, it felt wrong and just gross. \n\nIn a weird way, time is the only thing that's helped, seeing them more and more and now it's been years, if I do talk to ex or see her, we're great, but people move on and if your brother and his new girlfriend stay the course, it will get easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd if they don't last, then you can call him a bloody idiot for doing what he did without ruining your relationship x", "OP is not an asshole, but I think she is a bit rigid in thinking that this is so unforgivable and that she doesn't see her brother the same way anymore. I'm just saying, her brother is not necessarily an asshole either. It's not black and white. OP's brother was engaged to someone he wasn't compatible with. He was unhappy. She was materialistic and didn't like his family. He should have ended the engagement before seeing other people, definitely. But, for probably a multitude of reasons, that was difficult. We don't know all the details in this situation, but I know plenty of people who got engaged not necessarily because they were super compatible with each other but because \"well, we're almost 30 and we've been together for a few years, my girlfriend wants a ring.\" Even though there are lots of red flags in the relationship. I mean, who knows. It takes 2 to have a shitty relationship. I just feel like, despite the cheating, if her brother is in a happier relationship now with someone he's more compatible with, that's not such a bad thing. Also, his ex-fianc\u00e9 sounded like a bummer so, perhaps this is an overall positive thing. At least they didn't get married and then realize they weren't happy. I've seen people do that too and it's much messier to divorce then to break off an engagement. I dunno, open your mind a little. I hope that OP will give her brother a little slack and not let this get in the way of having a relationship with him. If he's happy, that's  much better than a miserable marriage.", "Mmm... I would argue that actually, polyamorous or open relationships are becoming a lot more popular lately. I know plenty of people in happy, open relationships. Monogamy isn't the only option in life. \n\nPeople in monogamous relationships should be honest with each other though. I do think that OP'S brother should have told his ex that he was unhappy and that he wanted to end the engagement before he started seeing his new GF."]}
