It's common to say \"partner\" these days, regardless of marriage status. Not that such an issue actually matters here.\n\nSide note.... I notice that you said \"the child that came from your balls\". Do you not know how biology or childbirth works? Males only provide an injection of genetic material, it's the woman who creates the child and pushes it out."]}
