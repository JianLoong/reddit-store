Even the bridal party is not common, just a best man and MOH with no actual roles apart from signing the register.\nOur total costs were around 4000\u20ac for lunch, cake buffet and cold evening buffet.", "NTA but dear is she out of the bridal party? What a shitty friend to have, I\u2019m sorry that you had to experience this.", "NTA. When I first read the subject I thought \u201cbridezilla\u201d, but no, this is entirely reasonable. Dump the bridesmaid.", "Bea can f\\*ck right off. \n\nShe is no friend.\n\nFind someone who cares for you to be your bridesmaid and tell Bea to sling her hook.\n\nNone of your requests are in the least bit unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA, I\u2019ll admit I haven\u2019t bee. In a lot of weddings  but I\u2019ve never heard of the bride paying for every bridesmaid to have their own hotel room, I thought that was normally something bridesmaids paid for", "NTA\n\nFrankly I\u2019m disappointed. I came here expecting some kind of Bridezilla asshole shenanigans and instead you\u2019re being beyond generous in trying to accommodate Bea - and it sounds like she just wants a free fancy hotel stay with her boyfriend. Girl is trying to take advantage of you and l making out like SHE\u2019S the victim.\n\nYou would not be the asshole if you cut her loose and found a bridesmaid with less attitude.", "NTA. These all seem like really reasonable requests to me.", "Over the years I've had a few people I know ask me to be the photographer at their destination wedding. None of them offered me a dime to do the photography nor offered to pay for my room or transportation costs. \n\nI turned them all down. \n\nI'm always happy for them when people tell me they are getting married but I am not putting my money towards it. It's not MY wedding and frankly I'd never ask people to foot the bill for any major expense if it was. \n\nI just don't believe in spending a year's pay on getting married. I doubt I'll ever go there but if I ever did it would be on a beach close to home, him and me, an officiant and a couple of close friends to witness it. \n\nThat's it. \n\nIf you want an expensive wedding, cool, but you are the one choosing that and frankly I think you should pay for it all and not put the huge expense on friends and family. It's not their wedding and they are going out of their way to be there for you wherever when you could just get married and celebrate in a local park or someone's backyard for a heck of a lot less. \n\nBig dream, big expense, but IMHO you'd better have a big wallet too because expecting people to shell out the bug bucks just so they can attend I think is asking a bit much.", "Probably one of the very first AITA I\u2019ve read regarding bride/bridesmaid expectations where the bride is being both reasonable and kind. Kudos to you for being a great friend (even if your bridesmaid doesn\u2019t see it and seems set on being an entitled ah) absolutely NTA and congratulations on your impending nuptials!", "NTA clearly. \n\nYou didn't saddle your bridesmaids with the typical 2-4000 dollar pre wedding celebration AND you also offered to cover an Airbnb??  That's just like ideal conditions.\n\n\"It just sounds like you're just not interested in being a bridesmaid, but thanks for trying!\"\n\nThen remove her from the planning and seriously, be on your way to your wonderful wedding.  We are too old for this drama shit.", "LOL what asshole, who the frick expects the bride and groom to pay for all of the wedding parties needs lol. She's an adult and can figure it out.", "NTA.\n\nWho gets informed of the block and doesn't book a room right away?  She has no one to blame but herself.  Not up to you to chase her when you have plenty of other things to worry about.", "NTA!! What, like you were supposed to remind her about the block over and over while also planning your wedding and coordinating with other guests? \n\nThe norm is paying for your own room, whether you\u2019re a guest or a member of the wedding party. Your friend reacted really poorly and that is on them. I\u2019d set a firm boundary that these are their options and you aren\u2019t discussing it further. I\u2019m sorry, I hope your other friends are being way more loving and focusing on the happy parts of planning your wedding \ud83d\udc97", "NTA - i feel like nothing you could do at this point would make her happy, so just stop trying, if she wanted to be there, she would make it work. seems like Bea might me a little bitter about your wedding.\n\nyour expectations were pretty normal and already accomodating so don\u2018t bend over backwards to cater to her needs, it\u2018s your wedding after all and you and your partner should come first, not a difficult bridesmaid.", "NTA. Bea is just greedy.", "NTA. I had a fellow bridesmaid who had similar expectations of the bride whose wedding we were in.\n\nUnreasonable expectations would be having your bridesmaids alter their appearance beyond just getting their hair and makeup done, they pay for everything of yours, they HAD to get hair and makeup professionally done out of pocket, etc. etc.\n\nBea is just being difficult", "NTA. Bea is pretty unreasonable. If she doesn't want to pay for a room(or can't afford it in order to attend the wedding), if she doesn't want to be honest, it is  better ask her to step down.", "She\u2019s ridiculous. Bye Bye, Bea.", "NTA, it was considerate of you to pay for hair, makeup, and not force anyone to pay for extra trips.  You let them pick whatever dress they wanted instead of requiring them to buy one they may not like.  That's way less money than the average wedding party members end up shelling out to be in a wedding.  You do not have unreasonable expectations.  And offering to pay for the Airbnb was more than you needed to do.  Tell her you would love to have her in the wedding and you've sent her lots of options on where she can stay, but you aren't paying for her hotel room isn't in your budget.  If she doesn't want to come, then she doesn't have to.", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust different expectations, and bad communication.", "Hmm\u2026do you think she might be jealous that you\u2019re getting married?", "NTA. You offered to pay for housing. Tell Bea you will see her after the wedding.", "NTA \n\nYour expectations are extremely reasonable!! You are doing more than most brides, IMO. I think Bea should be removed from the wedding party quite frankly.", "NTA. I would just frankly let her know that you will NOT be buying her a hotel room, and then ask her if she will be attending or not so you can plan accordingly. Bea is being a terrible friend, trying to squeeze you to make up for her own procrastination. You are SUPER generous for offering her the condo on your dime and she is an idiot for not accepting.\n\nDo your mutual friends know this is happening?", "Yeah. YTA. Whats the deal with everyone expecting their bridal parties to split costs? Elope if you can\u2019t afford a wedding..and don\u2019t be petty.", "I paid for my close family to come on holiday for my birthday and I made sure they had separate rooms. It IS the burden of the inviting party to provide accommodation for guests. But I guess some people never learnt manners..YTA", "That was my hope by choosing any black dress they wanted! I hate being wasteful and wanted them to be able to use it again and feel glamorous and confident at the wedding in a dress they feel suits them.", "I brought it up because I could understand not wanting to share a condo if a person had sensory issues and needed peace and quiet. But that\u2019s not the case with Bea.", "I completely understand that, and I told all of my bridesmaids and guests that I would absolutely understand and not be upset if any of them didn\u2019t come. I know we\u2019re all in our 30s and there are lots of weddings all year, and some folks are saving to buy a house and whatnot. I just wish she\u2019d been less unkind about the situation and was more flexible about accepting the help I was able to offer.", "A birthday is different than a wedding. It\u2019s standard for wedding guests and members of the wedding party to pay their own way. That\u2019s part of accepting the offer to become a bridesmaid.", "When I was best man for one of my friends, he sent us the link to book our room in the allocated block - I (happily) paid for the room myself though, as I did for the stag (bachelor) party. \n\nOffering to pay for a condo is more generous than you need to be.
