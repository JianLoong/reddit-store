Your rules.\n\nNext.", "Nta", "  \nDon't worry, OP.  You're NTA.\n\nIf anyone asks, just tell them that no homophobes were invited to your wedding.", "NTA. Your explanation to your SIL was spot on, too.", "NTA. Your wedding, your rules. Inviting him to the wedding will not change his behavior. Don\u2019t let him potentially affect your big day.", "NTA, op. What a sad situation, but better protect your special day. I think your brother and SIL will need a few extra hugs and reassurances though as they must feel so ashamed. \n\nThere's a lot of rabbit-holes for people to fall down and I guess this one got your nephew. I bet at this point his homophobia is part of how he defines his identity and he takes pride in being controversial. However, as he gets older maybe it will shift...here's hoping.\n\nI feel like his anger is coming from somewhere. It might be projection if he's gay himself but the fact it started when he was younger makes me think that there was rage about something else and it just got diverted and gayness got scapegoated in the process. Sometimes anger is anger, but sometimes anger masks much more painful feelings like sadness and shame. It may be that he was experiencing something pretty awful emotionally at that time at 8 or 9 which mom and dad were not aware of. Or, it might just be that he's a little asshole who gets a kick out of attention and reaction to his beliefs.", "NTA.  Who cares if a homophobe hates you?  He doesn\u2019t get a pass because of his age.", "How would he end up hating you cause he wasn't invited to an event he doesn't agree with and wouldn't want to attend. \n\nYour special day is your special day and not a teaching moment.\n\nWe're entitled to our feelings but I will never understand being homophobic, love is such a wonderful thing, it gives happiness, strength, just makes you feel freaking awsum waking up and looking at your partner smiling thinking I'm the luckiest person in the world. Loving is great but when your loved just as hard back that's something words can't explain. If you have that why should it mean less if you 2 men or 2 women in a partnership.", "NAH", "It\u2019s your wedding. It should be who you and your SO want. Congrats!", "NTA it's not your job as a gay man to be a teaching device or exposure therapy for a homophobic little troll even if he is your nephew.", "Considering his parents, his reaction is extreme. I wonder if he's just scared to come out. In any case, it's your special day & your rules. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour wedding day IS NOT the day to him comfortable with two men kissing!\n\nNo. No. No. \n\nTake him to Mardis Gras. Take him to a bloody movie. Take him to somewhere where gay men are. Idk. But not your wedding", "It\u2019s not your job to correct your brothers and SIL bad parenting. And yes the internet is to blame, but so are they. They could\u2019ve taught him empathy, monitored his online footprint, put him in therapy, anything. It\u2019s not your job to teach all this during your  happy day.", "This is a day of celebration and LOVE not hatred. Congratulations \ud83c\udf7e\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf88to you and your soon-to-be spouse! You have said nothing that would make you TA. NTA. Homophobia, on the other hand? F*ck off w/that shit.", "It's possible but we have no indication to believe that may be the case other than his odd repulsion of homosexuality.", "While I admit it is possible he may be gay or curious or whatever, we have no evidence to suggest so other than his repulsion from homosexuality... so not enough to ask him if he's gay, considering the possible reaction. \n\nMy partner and I have dated since nephew was 8 or 9, and before that I was just the bachelor uncle who visited for holidays because I was away at college and law school. It was when he was around that age that I brought my partner for holidays and visits and then eventually moved closer to my home city and came around more frequently. His first time meeting my partner was the innocent misconception stage (\"boys can't date boys\" etc) and it's steadily picked up in hatefulness from there.", "I'd think she was wrong but understandably so if they lived across the country and never really saw each other or something, but this seems to me like a really bizarrely optimistic idea.", "NTA.  He doesn't respect you or your partner now.  What makes your SIL think seeing two men get married is going to change his opinion?  Besides, it's not your job to educate him or try to change his opinion.  Do you really want a bigoted homophobe, no matter the age, at your wedding?", "Dude, your nephew is gay and can't accept it, so he's lashing out.", "Or the internet. It's depressingly easy for people (especially boys and young men) to fall down a right-wing rabbit hole through youtube and other social media.", "But maybe the nephew is realizing he himself might be gay and is struggling with his new undisclosed identity.  Has happened many times", "It's possible. I've asked my brother if he thinks this is a possibility and he said he doesn't think so and he doesn't get a \"gay vibe\" from him. I pointed out my brother didn't realize I was gay either until I told him, so he's uncertain at best. No one wants to broach the subject with him, obviously, due to his behavior and potential reaction.", "i kinda think so too", "Whether that's the case or not, it doesn't excuse away years of gross behaviour towards his uncle.  Struggling with his sexuality is not an excuse to be disrespectful.  Why on earth would OP want him there?", "I was thinking this was the underlying reason for his \u201cattitude\u201d. I went to high school with a couple of guys that were homophobes\u2026ends up they were in the closet.", "I've commented this elsewhere but will answer again for your ease of reading: I asked my brother if he thought nephew could be struggling with his sexuality and he said he doesn't get those \"vibes\" from him, pointing out he is a popular athlete and has had girlfriends and such. I pointed out that I was a popular athlete in high school and \"dated\" girls as cover as well and that my brother thought I was 100% straight until I told him otherwise. So he admits he might be but he has no evidence to support that."]}
