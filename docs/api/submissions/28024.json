Your sil sounds like she\u2019s saying \u201cyes I know he\u2019s a terrible little homophobe, but his feelings will be hurt.\u201d Why isn\u2019t she getting to the root of the behavior?

Honestly, I don't think he'd hate you for not being invited.

I understand why you choose not to, but well.   \n\n\nWhat's your brother's opinion on this? You only told about your SIL's reaction.  \n\n\nIs there any chance you can explain your nephew *in person* why he'll not be invited?

You are never an AH for who you invite/don't invite to your wedding. And your reasoning is sound. And you explained it kindly to his parents.

Family is vital and sadly they are the ones that are truly rigid sometimes. \n\nIt's 2023 the Dark Ages are over.  \n\nI have been accused several times of being a homophobic asshole.  It was simply a matter of not liking an individual and had nothing to do with their sexual preferences.     I have used the F word in the past but I am from a generation where it was a common greeting to a male friend.   Obviously, it's asinine today and I don't use it.  I never even knew an openly homosexual person till I was an adult.   It wasn't something that was openly discussed back then.   I digress but the point is you do you. Let everyone else worry about their position in their own business.\n\n  Don't jump to conclusions.  Not everything is black and white.
