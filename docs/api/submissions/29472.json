Dad probably deserved a few choice words since you say he was helping his son pick the targets who least wanted to get wet. However, cursing at him in a public waterpark next to a kids' play area could've been inconsiderate of the enjoyment of families within earshot who don't want their kids hearing that language. That's what makes an arse, being inconsiderate of others. You don't score points for stopping him because you only commented when he was done. I'm also skeptical that cursing at the bully you say he is will improve his behavior. Hence, both arses.\n\nUpdate: Changed my vote from E-S-H to N-T-A as no kids overheard the exchange!

While it's important to stand up against actions that you find harmful or inappropriate, the way you conveyed your message might have come across as confrontational.  \nIt's generally a good idea to address such issues with more tact and respect, focusing on the behavior rather than making personal accusations. You could have said something like, \"I don't think it's right to target people with water buckets without their consent,\" which would have conveyed your point without being as direct or confrontational. While the intent behind your comment may have been to discourage his behavior, it's essential to communicate in a way that promotes understanding and productive dialogue.  \nSo, while your message had a valid point, your approach might have made you come across as the one being confrontational, which can lead to further conflicts.", "YTA, it's a waterpark, what do you think people do there?", "[deleted]", "It\u2019s a harmless prank, yeah people got wet but it\u2019s a water park - lighten up a bit.

NTA\n\nIt's understandable that some situations may require a more direct approach, and you make a valid point about the need to address the behavior firmly. In certain cases, being straightforward may be the most effective way to convey disapproval and make a strong statement against actions that are perceived as harmful. The key is to consider the specific circumstances and the personality of the individual involved, as different approaches may yield different results. Ultimately, the intention behind addressing such behavior is to discourage it and promote positive actions and interactions.", ">Thank you for the input.

I almost thought it was all in fun (we are at a water park), but the targeting of people who clearly were clothed hit me wrong.  I should have used better words.\n\nYou're welcome, and I appreciate your understanding. It's entirely understandable that past experiences, such as being bullied, can influence our emotional reactions in situations like this. It's always a good practice to reflect on our reactions and consider more constructive ways to address such issues, especially when children are involved. Your awareness of the situation and willingness to use better words in the future is a positive step towards promoting respectful and understanding communication. Remember, we can influence others positively by modeling the behavior we want to see.", "I\u2019m not really sure what style of water park you\u2019re talking about then, teeter buckets are usually fixed on a pole", "Agreed. The guy was also running away after they dumped the water. If it's a harmless prank, stay and face what you did instead of hiding,  just saying.", "[deleted]", ">being straightforward is the most effective way\n\nYes, I agree. I do believe OP did that, and I fail to see how your advice is more or less straightforward. The message isn\u2019t the issue here, it\u2019s the syntax.\n\n>the key is to consider specific circumstances\n\nOh wow, I had not considered that /s\nThat\u2019s what I did though. I don\u2019t think the father would have responded at all to your suggestion. I believe OP handled it with the correct syntax given the context of the father\u2019s trollish actions.\n\n>ultimately, the intention behind addressing such behavior is to discourage it and promote positive actions and interactions\n\nYeah, I agree. OP hit it out of the park. It\u2019s fine if you disagree. Thanks for cracking open your AP Psych textbook to Chapter 1, though. Seriously, just telling the dude \u201cthat wasn\u2019t nice\u201d isn\u2019t going to change his behavior. It sounds like OP actually did something by shaming him in front of his wife.\n\nSometimes that\u2019s what you need. I\u2019m sure your methods are great for children though, and I don\u2019t mean that sarcastically. I mean, that\u2019s how you deal with children bullies, but not full-grown men.", "The bucket was fixed on a pole and meant to get about 1/4 full and tip one way or another.  This father and son were holding the bucket steady until it was full to the top (it never would have done this on its own).  Then they were waiting for only the clothed people to walk by and then forcibly pushing the bucket over when they got right in front of it.  Only to thr clothed people, not the people in suits.  It wouldn't get them drenched, but pretty wet.  Even if they held the bucket and let it fall normally, would have been fine, it was the forcible shove and targeted aim for only people dressed.  Hope that explanation helps.", ">I\u2019m not really sure\n\nSometimes ignorance is a sign you shouldn\u2019t comment", "No, these people were clothed and outside the bucket circle.  It was clear they were watching their children,  but didn't want to, or couldn't,  be in a swimsuit.  I'm sure they assumed they would get a little mist, but not drenched, as was evidenced by many getting upset.  The guy and his kid ran and hid, so there was no body to blame (for the people casually walking by).  I was in the wet area, so I saw it happening from another angle.", "Its more understandable so overall I\u2019d say NTA then. \n\nI get why you\u2019d be frustrated but at the end of the day if you\u2019re in spitting distance of a teeter bucket, even with that design, it\u2019s on you if you get wet. I don\u2019t think the dad is setting a great example but I wouldn\u2019t really call that asshole behavior either, it\u2019s practically harmless. That being said it\u2019s not asshole behavior to step in and comment there either.", "So I was supposed to be aware that it was an unusual design before I commented? Then nobody but OP can comment, everyone was ignorant on this. Usually a teeter bucket isn\u2019t set up anywhere that you\u2019re not intended to get wet.", "You take the information given in the post, you don\u2019t assume things.\n\nSometimes you don\u2019t make stuff up in your head before you comment. Sometimes you fully comprehend what OP is saying before you comment.\n\nYou simply assumed you knew the layout of the water park and it derailed OP\u2019s story. Sorry, buddy.\n\n>I\u2019m supposed to be aware it was an unusual design\n\nNo, man, you just shouldn\u2019t have assumed. And you shouldn\u2019t have commented, passing judgement, without the requisite knowledge. You can\u2019t just make stuff up because it makes sense to you.\n\nEdit: Gotta add it here \u2018cause I can\u2019t reply to his comment anymore, but here\u2019s my response to his reply to this comment:\n\nI don\u2019t understand your snarkiness lol.\n\nClearly the father and his son were being malicious, as they were holding the bucket and then dumping it and hiding. What else do you need?\n\nOh wait, I see your profile icon now \ud83d\ude02 yeah you\u2019re the type of person who will just keep making excuses based on ignorance, huh?\n\nI guess since I\u2019m blocked I\u2019ll just say it\u2026 wtf is up with that profile icon \ud83d\ude02 that is the cringiest shit I\u2019ve ever seen.

I don\u2019t understand how you can be under a teeter bucket and not expect to get wet. If the kid and his dad were bringing their own bucket or something, OP should have said so.
