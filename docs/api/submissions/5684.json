If your dogs always cause stress when you bring them to your dad's, don't bring them to your dad's.", "YTA. Read the room. Your dad does not want you to bring your dogs to his house. He might love them, but he doesn\u2019t love having them around. That is why he \u201cconstantly complains about them being around\u201d.  Make other arrangements for your dogs - leave them home & get a dog sitter or board them or something besides bringing them with you.  If you don\u2019t think enough of other people to stop your dogs from hurting them, then do it for your dogs. The authorities in many places take a dim view of dogs who injure children, & repeated incidents can result in your dogs being put down.", "Yep, YTA. \n\nYour dad gave you notice he wanted to take the nieces  outside.

Let me know when you want to play and I\u2019ll secure the dogs.\u201d My dad said ok.*\n\nSo you say no to your dad bringing up taking the little ones outside? \n\nAlso, in your responses to other commenters you keep flip-flopping over what exactly was said. Some comments you say he didn't say anything. Others you said he might take them out later. One comment you said something about how your dad is not supposed to bring them outside because the girls' mom is concerned about the cold. Even your edit doesn't really line up with the original text. \n\n\nIf your father said ANYTHING about taking the little ones outside, whether that be in that moment, later, or in a few minutes that should be your sign to immediately get the dogs inside and in the room.\n\n\n\n*My dad then began yelling at me for the Doberman \u201cnot being trained\u201d and started berating me in front of my family by getting in my face and screaming. \n I do know he (my dog)is not socialized with small kids and I\u2019ve been actively working on introducing the Doberman and my other dog to my older niece by keeping them on a leash when they\u2019ve been around her (rarely). It\u2019s possible that I could have gone outside proactively and brought the dogs inside.*\n\n\nSorry, but I firmly believe that you should NOT bring a dog to major family events if they don't have good manners. Did your father possibly get a bit too ill with you? Probably. However, he has a point with being upset with the dog not being trained properly. I get that your doberman is still a puppy. I get that training doesn't happen overnight. I get that dogs have to learn how to behave around little ones. However, you are also brought the dog to a family event where everyone (including you) are around a lot of distractions, and you put your dog in a position where you could not accurately control/inhibit his bad behavior. On top of that you also know that your dad is anal about dogs showing proper behavior. You honestly set your dog up for failure by bringing him to this gathering. Also, you have a doberman. A doberman is big even at 7 months old. Your niece is still a toddler. He could have easily done much more damage to her just from being overstimulated and excited. You also run a high risk of instilling a fear of dogs into your niece by these situations happening.\n\n\n\n*EDIT (clarification): my dad did not tell us he wanted to go outside at that exact moment. He said he would let me know. Then, when I asked him why he took my niece out he said because he thought he could manage her and the dogs outside.*\n\n\nAgain, doesn't line up with your original text nor your comments. Doesn't matter if he didn't necessarily mean at that moment, it was your sign to put your dogs up. You said no, so of course he was going to try and manage the dogs because you didn't listen.\n\n\nSorry but YTA. Next time just board your dog at a daycare or find someone who can watch him and leave him at home until he is trained and has learned his manners.", "Yta, just leave the dogs at home, it seems like no one else wants them there and just sucks it up because you\u2019ll refuse to come if you don\u2019t have them with you.", "YTA. Why are the dogs even there? If it's a conflict with your dad every single time, leave the dog at home. If pup can't bear being alone and you can't get a sitter, BF will just have to miss out on lunch.", "All the yta are bullshit here.\n\nYes legally you are responsible for your dogs. Even when you clearly tell someone not to bring the kids in the garden and they do it anyway and the kids get hurt. Even when someone else fucks it up you are the responsible one, on legal grounds. Morally, it's another matter.\n\nYour father lashed out onto you because he knows he messed up by bringing the kids outside with the dogs.\n\nYes you could have brought the dog inside in their crates. You didn't. No one should have gone outside with the kids. \n\nNta", "YTA. It is true that your father was aware that the dogs were outside and should have listened, especially knowing your dog is not trained. \n\nThat said, your dad is right about you not training your dog and 7 months is old enough to be training your dog not to jump on people. Keeping him on a leash around kids is doing nothing to discourage this behavior. 'Socializing' a dog is not the same as proper training. It is extremely unfair to the dog who is misbehaving because they do not know better and could get into a lot of trouble because you haven't given him the proper discipline or structure. He is your responsibility and his failings are your failings. Your dog needs to stay at home until you've properly trained him.", "So you said \u201clmk when you want to take the kid(s) out and I will take the dogs inside,\u201d then your dad said he wanted to go out and you said \u201cno\u201d to taking the dogs in. \n\nYTA and a liar", "YTA. there's a bunch of back and forth about what was said, but none of that matters. if you have a big untrained dog that gets physical, you don't bring it with you anywhere except the trainer. you risk your dog's life when you do this, cuz if the dog ends up hurting someone seriously, the dog will be put down. and that would be your fault, again, because you didn't train your dog or leave it at home until it's trained.", "YTA\n\nHe literally told you he wanted to go outside, and your response is \"no the dogs are outside, let me know when you want to go out\"\n\nHE DID literally seconds prior.", "Of course YTA. They told you they wanted to go outside and you did nothing. Also it\u2019s your job to train them. And also AGAIN if your Dad is nervous of them you could have put them in kennels.\n\nYou\u2019re a dog own, be a responsible one.", "YTA. You don\u2019t bring those kinds of dogs to someone elses house when you know small children are going to be there, regardless of how well you think you can contain them. This will always happen.", "How old is this puppy and why isn't it in obedience classes?  Puppy or not, it shouldn't be jumping on people [especially as it sounds half grown].", "Sorry, but yes, (mildly) ESH. \n\nYour Dad absolutely needed to comport himself better.\n\nBut also, if you let your dog do it now, it's going to be something your dog continues to do right into adulthood. You don't have to be harsh, but you 100% do need to correct behavior, without fail. \n\nYou decided to have your (new) dog at a family gathering, your priority needed to be managing your dog, not a party.", "YTA. Why are you bringing untrained dogs anywhere, let alone others\u2019 houses?", "YTA. Your dad did ask, you told him no, he said okay to your \u201cno\u201d and  hedecided to take the kids outside anyway. He thought he could handle it and he thought he needed to handle it since you told him no.\n\nIf you\u2019re as bad at dog training as you are at social cues it explains a lot about your dog\u2019s behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have expounded that you gave your father options on not having the dog around.

He is the one who doesn't like the dogs and can't handle them, yet still went outside without explicitly telling you because he decided for this one time that he can handle it. Maybe there should have been more communication in how he asked/you interpreted him saying that he was going outside, but he knew the dogs were still out there and he did it anyway. He thought he asked you to bring them inside, saw that they were still outside, and still figured he can handle it. He is an adult who assessed a situation that he has said he can't handle and still did it anyway. If you're interested in maintaining a relationship with your father (who screamed at you for his own mistake??), then you're going to have to board your puppy when you visit.

With all dog training, you **always train them pro-actively**. You don't wait for them to get food aggression before you train them to not do that. You don't wait for a child to end up in the hospital being bitten in the face before you socialize your dog to kids.\n\nDog socialization starts at 10-16 weeks.

Sure. But all the suggestions here how OP was supposed to do it better are mostly ridiculous. Sure a dog shouldn't jump at people, no matter the size of people, but especially not at children. However, we are talking about a pre-teen dog who has to LEARN how to behave properly and with a dog it is learning by doing. It's not like you can lock your dog up and give them a book about proper behavior and everything is solved. Dogs learn at a  different pace just as kids do, and they do learn by being confronted with the issue. You don't put dogs in a cage for several days just because. They are not guinea pigs. You don't avoid constantly to bring a young dog in a situation where he might misbehave or he will certainly misbehave forever as he doesn't know better. \nDas said he wanted to go out, mother of child said it was too cold, so going out was off the table and there was literally no reason to put the dogs away which are certainly happier playing outside then being locked up. \nDad said he would give a heads-up before he goes outside because OP emphasized several times that the kids should not be outside with the dogs and dad alone.\nDad didn't do as promised bc he felt he could handle it but couldn't. Where does that make OP T A? \n\nNTA OP. Training dogs takes time. Dogs have needs and putting them in cages because someone might decide at some point to actually go out doesn't make sense. Everyone was aware that the dogs were out and young. You offered to put them away when they actually go out which is enough. You would have if they had informed you as they said they did.

I could easily bring my dogs to my Mom's but she freaks out about her cat. So, the dogs get boarded when I travel to her house. My dogs, my responsibility. Her house, her choice.

His reasoning was \"he could handle both kid and dogs\".\n\nNow. I really have *no idea* why you get all the AH. You told him to wait, he ignored it. Your dogs are youngsters and therefore not yet well trained. You told him so, you did everything nothing happens.

This is massively unfair to your dogs and everyone forced to deal with them.

Set them up for success, and unfortunately, that seems to include separate boarding during holidays. I do think seven months is old enough for a dobe to know not to jump up, but I also understand the dog was excited and well, an excited dog tends to act like a dog. Have you talked to your niece or her parents yet? I think you should and for practicality sake, ask if you can try to introduce them to each other while the dog is on a leash and remains seated. That was a very scary experience, and letting her know the dog was excited and that the dog usually doesn't act that way can help prevent her from developing a life long fear.\n\nI don't mean this as a personal attack, but it seems you struggle with social cues (which I can too). I read your father saying he wants to take your niece outside was meant as in that moment, he was trying to be \"polite\" about it, but you (especially as you were stressed and focused on other tasks) needed a more direct \"I want to do this right now, can you move the dogs.\" He should have made his intentions more clear, and should have listened to you about keeping them separated", "Lmao what\u2019s doesn\u2019t make sense?!
