We are visiting my dad\u2019s house for Xmas and my dad is extremely anal about the dogs . He says he loves them but then constantly complains about them being around and I try to cater to his requests, one of them being that he prefers the dogs outside when my smaller nephews/nieces are over visiting. \n\nI have no problem with this and me and my BF are always on heightened alert, making sure the dogs aren\u2019t making messes and aren\u2019t in the way. \n\nToday, my nieces (2F and 4F) came over with the rest of the family. We put the dogs outside so they wouldn\u2019t have to be in a cramped room all day. \n\nEverything was fine, until my nieces started bouncing a basketball inside the house. I could tell they might want to go outside but I am always reminding them and their parents to not let the small kids outside with the large dogs. To instead let me know and myself or BF will bring the dogs inside to our room and put them on their cages to nap/eat. \n\nI reminded the older niece \u201cMichelle\u201d to let me know if she wanted to play outside so I could move the dogs, I also told her dad this. A few minutes later my dad mentions how he wants to take my nieces outside , and I said to him (and everyone else in the room) \u201cno, the dogs outside right now. Let me know when you want to play and I\u2019ll secure the dogs.\u201d My dad said ok. \n\nThen not even 5 minutes later , we all realized my dad had  grabbed my 4 YO nieces hand and walked her outside . The Doberman puppy excitedly ran over to them and jumped on her shoulders and knocked her back against the door. I instantly ran to the door to help my dad but then my dad sprang the door open and let the dogs run into the house and came in yelling. I secured the dogs back outside. \n\nMy dad then began yelling at me for the Doberman \u201cnot being trained\u201d and started berating me in front of my family by getting in my face and screaming. \n I do know he (my dog)is not socialized with small kids and I\u2019ve been actively working on introducing the Doberman and my other dog to my older niece by keeping them on a leash when they\u2019ve been around her (rarely).

He was originally my dads for several months but my dad couldn\u2019t train him because he was too hyper. There was other obedience issues we had to work through (potty training, recall etc.) and haven\u2019t had the opportunity to train the puppy around kids using a leash because 1) my dad doesn\u2019t want the kids around my dogs 2) there aren\u2019t many kids in my life when I\u2019m not at my parents house. This is why I\u2019ve also put him in a more advanced obedience class.\n\nEDIT3: my dad verbally requests that we stay at the house because he wants us there, despite us offering we arrange other accommodations (hotel /air bnb).

Make other arrangements for your dogs - leave them home & get a dog sitter or board them or something besides bringing them with you.  If you don\u2019t think enough of other people to stop your dogs from hurting them, then do it for your dogs.

Let me know when you want to play and I\u2019ll secure the dogs.\u201d My dad said ok.*\n\nSo you say no to your dad bringing up taking the little ones outside? \n\nAlso, in your responses to other commenters you keep flip-flopping over what exactly was said. Some comments you say he didn't say anything. Others you said he might take them out later. One comment you said something about how your dad is not supposed to bring them outside because the girls' mom is concerned about the cold. Even your edit doesn't really line up with the original text. \n\n\nIf your father said ANYTHING about taking the little ones outside, whether that be in that moment, later, or in a few minutes that should be your sign to immediately get the dogs inside and in the room.\n\n\n\n*My dad then began yelling at me for the Doberman \u201cnot being trained\u201d and started berating me in front of my family by getting in my face and screaming. \n I do know he (my dog)is not socialized with small kids and I\u2019ve been actively working on introducing the Doberman and my other dog to my older niece by keeping them on a leash when they\u2019ve been around her (rarely). It\u2019s possible that I could have gone outside proactively and brought the dogs inside.*\n\n\nSorry, but I firmly believe that you should NOT bring a dog to major family events if they don't have good manners. Did your father possibly get a bit too ill with you? Probably. However, he has a point with being upset with the dog not being trained properly. I get that your doberman is still a puppy. I get that training doesn't happen overnight. I get that dogs have to learn how to behave around little ones. However, you are also brought the dog to a family event where everyone (including you) are around a lot of distractions, and you put your dog in a position where you could not accurately control/inhibit his bad behavior. On top of that you also know that your dad is anal about dogs showing proper behavior. You honestly set your dog up for failure by bringing him to this gathering. Also, you have a doberman. A doberman is big even at 7 months old. Your niece is still a toddler. He could have easily done much more damage to her just from being overstimulated and excited. You also run a high risk of instilling a fear of dogs into your niece by these situations happening.\n\n\n\n*EDIT (clarification): my dad did not tell us he wanted to go outside at that exact moment. He said he would let me know. Then, when I asked him why he took my niece out he said because he thought he could manage her and the dogs outside.*\n\n\nAgain, doesn't line up with your original text nor your comments. Doesn't matter if he didn't necessarily mean at that moment, it was your sign to put your dogs up. You said no, so of course he was going to try and manage the dogs because you didn't listen.\n\n\nSorry but YTA. Next time just board your dog at a daycare or find someone who can watch him and leave him at home until he is trained and has learned his manners.", "Yta, just leave the dogs at home, it seems like no one else wants them there and just sucks it up because you\u2019ll refuse to come if you don\u2019t have them with you.", "YTA. Why are the dogs even there? If it's a conflict with your dad every single time, leave the dog at home. If pup can't bear being alone and you can't get a sitter, BF will just have to miss out on lunch.", "All the yta are bullshit here.\n\nYes legally you are responsible for your dogs. Even when you clearly tell someone not to bring the kids in the garden and they do it anyway and the kids get hurt. Even when someone else fucks it up you are the responsible one, on legal grounds. Morally, it's another matter.\n\nYour father lashed out onto you because he knows he messed up by bringing the kids outside with the dogs.\n\nYes you could have brought the dog inside in their crates. You didn't. No one should have gone outside with the kids. \n\nNta", "YTA. It is true that your father was aware that the dogs were outside and should have listened, especially knowing your dog is not trained. \n\nThat said, your dad is right about you not training your dog and 7 months is old enough to be training your dog not to jump on people. Keeping him on a leash around kids is doing nothing to discourage this behavior. 'Socializing' a dog is not the same as proper training. It is extremely unfair to the dog who is misbehaving because they do not know better and could get into a lot of trouble because you haven't given him the proper discipline or structure. He is your responsibility and his failings are your failings. Your dog needs to stay at home until you've properly trained him.", "So you said \u201clmk when you want to take the kid(s) out and I will take the dogs inside,\u201d then your dad said he wanted to go out and you said \u201cno\u201d to taking the dogs in. \n\nYTA and a liar", "YTA. there's a bunch of back and forth about what was said, but none of that matters. if you have a big untrained dog that gets physical, you don't bring it with you anywhere except the trainer. you risk your dog's life when you do this, cuz if the dog ends up hurting someone seriously, the dog will be put down. and that would be your fault, again, because you didn't train your dog or leave it at home until it's trained.", "YTA\n\nHe literally told you he wanted to go outside, and your response is \"no the dogs are outside, let me know when you want to go out\"\n\nHE DID literally seconds prior.", "Of course YTA. They told you they wanted to go outside and you did nothing. Also it\u2019s your job to train them. And also AGAIN if your Dad is nervous of them you could have put them in kennels.\n\nYou\u2019re a dog own, be a responsible one.", "YTA. You don\u2019t bring those kinds of dogs to someone elses house when you know small children are going to be there, regardless of how well you think you can contain them. This will always happen.", "How old is this puppy and why isn't it in obedience classes?  Puppy or not, it shouldn't be jumping on people [especially as it sounds half grown].", "Sorry, but yes, (mildly) ESH. \n\nYour Dad absolutely needed to comport himself better.\n\nBut also, if you let your dog do it now, it's going to be something your dog continues to do right into adulthood. You don't have to be harsh, but you 100% do need to correct behavior, without fail. \n\nYou decided to have your (new) dog at a family gathering, your priority needed to be managing your dog, not a party.", "YTA. Why are you bringing untrained dogs anywhere, let alone others\u2019 houses?", "YTA. Your dad did ask, you told him no, he said okay to your \u201cno\u201d and  hedecided to take the kids outside anyway. He thought he could handle it and he thought he needed to handle it since you told him no.\n\nIf you\u2019re as bad at dog training as you are at social cues it explains a lot about your dog\u2019s behavior.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is the one who doesn't like the dogs and can't handle them, yet still went outside without explicitly telling you because he decided for this one time that he can handle it. Maybe there should have been more communication in how he asked/you interpreted him saying that he was going outside, but he knew the dogs were still out there and he did it anyway. He thought he asked you to bring them inside, saw that they were still outside, and still figured he can handle it. He is an adult who assessed a situation that he has said he can't handle and still did it anyway.

With all dog training, you **always train them pro-actively**. You don't wait for them to get food aggression before you train them to not do that. You don't wait for a child to end up in the hospital being bitten in the face before you socialize your dog to kids.\n\nDog socialization starts at 10-16 weeks.

Sure. But all the suggestions here how OP was supposed to do it better are mostly ridiculous. Sure a dog shouldn't jump at people, no matter the size of people, but especially not at children. However, we are talking about a pre-teen dog who has to LEARN how to behave properly and with a dog it is learning by doing. It's not like you can lock your dog up and give them a book about proper behavior and everything is solved. Dogs learn at a  different pace just as kids do, and they do learn by being confronted with the issue. You don't put dogs in a cage for several days just because. They are not guinea pigs. You don't avoid constantly to bring a young dog in a situation where he might misbehave or he will certainly misbehave forever as he doesn't know better. \nDas said he wanted to go out, mother of child said it was too cold, so going out was off the table and there was literally no reason to put the dogs away which are certainly happier playing outside then being locked up. \nDad said he would give a heads-up before he goes outside because OP emphasized several times that the kids should not be outside with the dogs and dad alone.\nDad didn't do as promised bc he felt he could handle it but couldn't. Where does that make OP T A? \n\nNTA OP. Training dogs takes time. Dogs have needs and putting them in cages because someone might decide at some point to actually go out doesn't make sense. Everyone was aware that the dogs were out and young. You offered to put them away when they actually go out which is enough. You would have if they had informed you as they said they did.

He acts upset when I tell him it\u2019s ok for us to find another accommodation with the dogs because he then still gets upset at me because I have the dogs. \nThis is not the first time I\u2019ve visited with the dogs (including the Doberman) and nothing like this has ever happened.", "She was knocked back and fell on her butt because his paws pushed her shoulders . He didn\u2019t bite etc.", "Comprehension is difficult. \u201cWants to\u201d and \u201cis going to\u201d are very different situations. \n\nI agree, but want to add the counter point.  OPs \"LMK\" is also easily replaced with, \"you want to now?\". This would have been the most sensible response to me.  OP totally misinterpreted the situation.", "Your dad clearly doesn't much like dogs, whether they're trained or not, however much he swears he likes them - and I get a strong feeling he's saying so out of fatherly love and wanting to ensure you feel at home. \n\nI love dogs, but even I'm nervous around Dobermans, Rottweillers, etc, though  I know most are lovely affectionate creatures as dogs are generally. And if I'm staying with family members or friends who aren't dog people, especially if there's lots of kids around who'll jump all over them, then it's basic decency and good manners to get a sitter or board the dogs,  as well as being better for the dogs who won't be viewed as unwelcome.", "Also its his house!! Why should he ask you for permission to take the kids outside? You\u2019re the one who needed to keep the dogs in check the first time he said he\u2019s gonna go out.", "He can\u2019t manage his temper let alone children and animals together.", "This is why I was upset originally. My dad took my niece outside because he thought he could work with our puppy who had problems jumping on kids specifically. We have an e collar for my dog , and my dad didn\u2019t even take the remote out to use the commands. It\u2019s very frustrating for me because my dad WANTS us to stay at the house with him and we follow EVERYthing he requests about the dogs but this still happens.", "It appears I am in the minority with voting NTA, because I had to play the \"Dog Ballet\" yesterday at my daughter's house, very similar to the situation you described. I only live an hour away, but, because of my job's long commute, my dogs are alone in my house ten hours a day. Plus, I always have to arrive later and leave earlier than everyone else so the dogs are not home alone - again - for another full day. In my case, it's my elderly dog that has an issue with my daughter's younger, MUCH more active dog.  I bring a dog gate for my daughter's office, and my older dog stays in there most of the day. We switch out several times during the day. My other guy loves my daughter's dog and all of the excitement, so he is free to roam all day. It can be a pain, but it's good for the dogs to have a change and see the family, even if we have to do it in a bit of a restricted way.\n\nShould you have secured the dogs when your dad asked? Yes, probably, but he also could have said yes, that he wanted you to do that. Also, for the people criticizing over the lack of the puppy's training? He's a puppy, outside playing, and probably a bit riled up from it. Large dog breeds stay babies longer than smaller dogs, so 7 mos. is still very young. It will take another year, at least, before that dog is fully trained. The best scenario is the one you asked for - to be notified of needing to secure the dogs - and that one request was ignored. \n\nI will reprimand you a bit and say that, because of the situation, your senses should have been heightened to observe everyone else at the party so you could have avoided having your request ignored. When my dogs are not in their own house, I am always very aware of what everyone else is doing, to avoid possible dog trouble. This is a habit you may wish to develop, especially with a Doberman. (No breed prejudice - I have Chows. It's just that Dobermans are a very intelligent and headstrong breed. People will automatically assume it's aggressive, no matter what the dog is doing. Good training helps to alleviate that.) I also have my family \"trained\" about how to act around my dogs. I probably \"over-lecture\" to new friends and family to avoid possible issues. Because of this, I've never had a problem no matter where I take them. (They are trained, but that doesn't protect them from stupid people.) That might be a good plan for you for the future, as well. \n\nAs far as putting them in a kennel, I did that to one of my dogs once, and it took her over a year to recover. She was not abused there, but Chows never do well in any kennel situation, so I will never leave my dogs in boarding again. \n\nThere are a lot of holier-than-thou dog haters on this thread. But, I've been where you are, so I understand what you're saying. Take this as a learning moment, be thankful your niece wasn't hurt, and take all of the steps necessary to prevent future issues. I've never regretted the hours I put into training my dogs - but I do regret assuming other people weren't idiots. Yes, it's my job to watch over my dogs, but if I ask you for one thing regarding them, why, then, am I the careless one when you choose to ignore me? Good luck with your family, and your dog training!", "If you knew you were gonna be busy cooking why not already have him secure before they ask?", "Well \u2026 if the dog managed to jump on them it seems they weren\u2019t separated enough \ud83e\udd14", "The more you comment the more sure I am that you should find alternate places for your dog to be when you visit.

We had to train a lot of other more immediate obedience issues , like recall etc. it\u2019s hard to reach a dog to not jump on kids when you literally do not see any kids lol. My other dog IS trained around kids but it took him almost a year and very active seeking out areas where there might be kids (parks etc) to correctly train him to be calm around kids via the leash method. \nI\u2019m really surprised people don\u2019t understand how puppies are trained.", "How do you know??

Not much can ruin a dog's training faster than putting it into a chaotic situation it isn't prepared for with people who aren't familiar with its behaviors.

It is a fast way to set back training and make everything more difficult in the future. \n\n\nInstead you introduce those aspects in a controlled environment in a controlled way and up the difficulty over time. For example, let's say your dog has issues with getting excited about other people to the point that he will try to yank the leash out of your hands so he can run up to play with them. You don't put a leash on him and take him to a busy park right away. That is just going to set him up for failure as you didn't already establish what you want from him reliably and you are putting him in a position where his excitement will be tenfold. \n\n\nInstead you establish him turning his attention to you without other people present. Once that is made reliable (him turning to you with almost no hesitation between the command and him looking at your face), start working on getting his attention away from another person that is 20 feet away. Once that made reliable, start working on getting his attention away from someone who is 15 feet away, so on and so forth. You work your way up to taking him to a busy park because working your way up to it slowly like that not only strongly establishes to him that he doesn't need to run up to every person he sees, but it also desensitizes him to people being near so he actually won't be so excited about it that he can't function.", "Not to mention,  her dad requested she bring the dog!", "Tbf, the dog was originally OP's dad's.
