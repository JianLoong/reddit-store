Some people live their lives looking for a reason to get upset and blame other people. This is a woman who blamed you because someone else took your phone away!

Regardless granny definitely placed expectations on you and expected you to read her mind and follow suit.", "Granny doesn't want to know you because she can't handle loosing anyone else.

And worse, there was no correct answer. You give her space? Ignoring her. You contact her a lot? Bothering her while her husband is dying. She clearly thrives on being hard done by.\n\nYou cannot fix this. You haven't done anything to fix. Like a teenager she wants attention so she's acting out. Unlike a teenager you can't help the cause because she's either been like this her whole life or reacting poorly to her husband dying (have you checked that he's actually sick or did she make that up too?).\n\nThe unfortunate reality is if you want a relationship with her you might just have to put up with her behaviour.", "Not enough info, maybe YTA. According to your story, *your GM felt ignored because you didn't text as frequently as she thought you should have*.  Is that really it? There are a lot more words in your story, but not enough info for us to understand what was going on.\n\nHow many times did you text, over what period of time? Days or weeks or years?

I had been to her house at age 14, but it was an area I'm not used to, and her street has hundreds of houses, so I couldn't find her house to contact her directly.

And then a few minutes later, telling me she wanted to end the conversation, and all conversations.\n\nGiven that 16 years after losing my ability to contact her, and she is still holding it against me, I think she is stubborn enough to continue and given her age, I don't think she has a long time left to change her mind.", "He's definitely sick, he's always either in hospital, or I've seen him in a hospital bed at home, with nurses visiting.", "I messaged her updates about my daughter, major things, like starting nursery or doctor updates.
