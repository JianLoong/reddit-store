My family was moving at the time and our parents were asking us go help move the furniture.\n\nAmongst this furniture was an old kitchen table, a couch, and some bed frames.\n\nMy little brother and I grab the couch and begin to move it down the stairs. It\u2019s a heavy couch and my brother isn\u2019t the strongest. He\u2019s holding the end at the top of the stairs and I\u2019m near the bottom. The couch slipped from his hands and rammed me into the wall. \n\nI wasn\u2019t injured too badly but I still have major pain in my rib cage area. A breakage. It sucks but it was an accident and it happens.\n\nEver since then my brother has been really ashamed of himself. He thinks he\u2019s the reason I hurt so bad. He\u2019s been really annoying since then. He comes into my room to check up on me. That\u2019s cool. \n\nWhat isn\u2019t cool is his constant apologizing. His constant it\u2019s my fault attitude. He can\u2019t go a moment without seeing me without feeling bad that a couch crushed me because of him. Last night  he was in my room with me and he cried about how it\u2019s his fault.\n\nI\u2019m sick of this. Yes the couch slipped from his hands but the same could have happened to anyone. The whole reason I had him grab the end at the top of the stairs was actually because I feared the couch would slip from my hands and crush him at the bottom. \n\nAgain, it could have happened to anyone. I got sick of his crying to I told him that his blame myself attitude needs to fuck off forever. It\u2019s better I get crushed instead of my little bro. It was an accident and I told him to fucking get over it. \n\nHe left the room and I didn\u2019t see him until the morning when the family sat down for breakfast. He didn\u2019t look at me but at his food the whole time. After breakfast my mom speaks to me alone. Brother told her about what I said and that I just made him cry even more and that I need to be more careful with my words. My brother is on the spectrum and more sensitive to words like that than others.\n\nPerhaps mom is right but I\u2019m just sick of my brother\u2019s constant blame myself attitude.

Your brother is not the asshole, it could have happened to anyone.\n\nYour brother being on the spectrum is likely (not assuming anything here, but it's a common symptom) incredibly sensitive to someone being mad or disappointed in him. He probably thought you were mad at him but hiding it not to hurt his feelings. Then, when you actually got mad, his thought likely got confirmed.\n\nI'm not on the spectrum, but my best friend is. If something like this had happened between us, I would have sat her down, asked her how she thought she made me feel, then explain to her how I actually feel. Make her, or in your case your brother, truly understand you're not mad, you never were, and there truly is no need to apologize. Calm and rational is the golden ticket here. Try to leave emotions out the window.", "Info: have you told him that you forgive him and that you know he's sorry, he doesn't need to keep saying it because you know, and it's making it harder when he repeats it?\n\nTelling him it could have happened to anyone isn't the same as telling him you forgive him.", "Swearing at your brother won\u2019t help anything either, you know.  If you want this to get better for both your sakes, maybe suggest to your mom that his guilt is disrupting both your lives enough that he needs to talk this through with a therapist.  Ideally one who specializes in helping folks who are on the spectrum, because what he needs to hear may not be what someone who\u2019s not on the spectrum would need.  A very gentle YTA.  I have a disability that makes it easy to injure me (and potentially seriously), so I completely hear you on how obnoxious it gets when someone feels so guilty over hurting you that it\u2019s overwhelming, but the kind of anger you turned on your brother won\u2019t fix anything - it\u2019ll just make him feel even more guilty (because now he\u2019s upset you on top of injuring you) as well as being hurt by your words.", "Look, you're 17, you're injured, you're probably under a lot of stress with the move, and you have a brother on the spectrum. It's a lot to process for someone so young.\n\nSo please accept that I'm saying this with understanding... mildly, YTA.\n\nIt's a lot to ask of an adult, let alone a teen ager, but you have to be patient and find better ways to express yourself. And when you get to that breaking point, ask your parents for help - advice on how to talk to your brother, or even to step in and approach him themselves", "You may not be old enough but I have to:\n\n>My little brother and I grab the couch and begin to move it down the stairs\n\nPIVOT PIVOT!!\n\nHonestly its such a soft YTA, it could almost be NAH.\n\nNo need to swear in this context. He was apologizing, all be it for the xth time. \n\nHe felt guilty which is difficult to handle especially at 15.", "YTA.\n\nI thought maybe you weren\u2019t, until you mentioned he\u2019s autistic. At which point, you kind of have been an asshole here. Clearly this experience has been very difficult for your brother to process, and since, as you point out that you\u2019re probably going to be fine, your brother might have been hurt by this more than you. \n\nI have autistic people in my family, and one thing I learned long ago is that you can\u2019t lose patience with their differences, because those aren\u2019t things that they can change, and they aren\u2019t things that will go away. I don\u2019t know exactly how your brother\u2019s autism presents itself, and so I can\u2019t advise you on how you can help him through this state he\u2019s in, where the incident is clearly constantly at the forefront of his mind, but I know that you\u2019re not going to help him through a traumatic event by adding more trauma to it.", "YTA - Your brother is on the spectrum and you curse at him for being sorry after he is visibly upset. Yes he might be apologising a bit too often but just sit him down and reassure him.", "I remember my older brother smashing my head on to floor breaking my nose and spouting blood.  First he laughed then he threatened to kill me if i told Mom. You are NTA, just got a bit annoyed.", "Yta- part of autism is echolia which is the repetition of a certain phrase or question over and over again. You should KNOW this as a sister to someone on the spectrum. It\u2019s a major thing that people on the spectrum deal with and you don\u2019t even know that it seems. If you educate yourself better I don\u2019t think you would be irritated at him\u2026Your brother is autistic (mine too :) and my dad :) and my son :) ) so why you think his brain would just move on without being deeply upset and blaming himself is really AH of you. Your supposed to be on his team and understand that he won\u2019t do and say things how everyone else would. How dare you get annoyed and snap at him instead of just being all upbeat and like it\u2019s not your fault stop it!! I love you it was me too don\u2019t sweat it!!  I\u2019m fine!! The way you said it even sounds nasty like you\u2019re so bothered by him like wtf girl. EDUCATE YOURSELF ON YOUR BROTHERS AUTISM. \n\nYta.", "NTA - what were your parents doing when you kids were moving a heavy couch downstairs by yourselves? You\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed or permanently disabled and your parents are jerks for making your brother move the couch. As for your brother, tell you\u2019re sorry you yelled at him but that he needs to stop bringing it up because it\u2019s making you sad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
