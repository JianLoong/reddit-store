My family was moving at the time and our parents were asking us go help move the furniture.\n\nAmongst this furniture was an old kitchen table, a couch, and some bed frames.\n\nMy little brother and I grab the couch and begin to move it down the stairs. It\u2019s a heavy couch and my brother isn\u2019t the strongest. He\u2019s holding the end at the top of the stairs and I\u2019m near the bottom. The couch slipped from his hands and rammed me into the wall. \n\nI wasn\u2019t injured too badly but I still have major pain in my rib cage area. A breakage. It sucks but it was an accident and it happens.\n\nEver since then my brother has been really ashamed of himself. He thinks he\u2019s the reason I hurt so bad. He\u2019s been really annoying since then. He comes into my room to check up on me. That\u2019s cool. \n\nWhat isn\u2019t cool is his constant apologizing. His constant it\u2019s my fault attitude. He can\u2019t go a moment without seeing me without feeling bad that a couch crushed me because of him. Last night  he was in my room with me and he cried about how it\u2019s his fault.\n\nI\u2019m sick of this. Yes the couch slipped from his hands but the same could have happened to anyone. The whole reason I had him grab the end at the top of the stairs was actually because I feared the couch would slip from my hands and crush him at the bottom. \n\nAgain, it could have happened to anyone. I got sick of his crying to I told him that his blame myself attitude needs to fuck off forever. It\u2019s better I get crushed instead of my little bro. It was an accident and I told him to fucking get over it. \n\nHe left the room and I didn\u2019t see him until the morning when the family sat down for breakfast. He didn\u2019t look at me but at his food the whole time. After breakfast my mom speaks to me alone. Brother told her about what I said and that I just made him cry even more and that I need to be more careful with my words. My brother is on the spectrum and more sensitive to words like that than others.\n\nPerhaps mom is right but I\u2019m just sick of my brother\u2019s constant blame myself attitude.

Your brother is not the asshole, it could have happened to anyone.\n\nYour brother being on the spectrum is likely (not assuming anything here, but it's a common symptom) incredibly sensitive to someone being mad or disappointed in him. He probably thought you were mad at him but hiding it not to hurt his feelings. Then, when you actually got mad, his thought likely got confirmed.\n\nI'm not on the spectrum, but my best friend is. If something like this had happened between us, I would have sat her down, asked her how she thought she made me feel, then explain to her how I actually feel. Make her, or in your case your brother, truly understand you're not mad, you never were, and there truly is no need to apologize. Calm and rational is the golden ticket here. Try to leave emotions out the window.", "Info: have you told him that you forgive him and that you know he's sorry, he doesn't need to keep saying it because you know, and it's making it harder when he repeats it?\n\nTelling him it could have happened to anyone isn't the same as telling him you forgive him.", "Swearing at your brother won\u2019t help anything either, you know.  If you want this to get better for both your sakes, maybe suggest to your mom that his guilt is disrupting both your lives enough that he needs to talk this through with a therapist.  Ideally one who specializes in helping folks who are on the spectrum, because what he needs to hear may not be what someone who\u2019s not on the spectrum would need.  A very gentle YTA.  I have a disability that makes it easy to injure me (and potentially seriously), so I completely hear you on how obnoxious it gets when someone feels so guilty over hurting you that it\u2019s overwhelming, but the kind of anger you turned on your brother won\u2019t fix anything - it\u2019ll just make him feel even more guilty (because now he\u2019s upset you on top of injuring you) as well as being hurt by your words.", "Look, you're 17, you're injured, you're probably under a lot of stress with the move, and you have a brother on the spectrum. It's a lot to process for someone so young.\n\nSo please accept that I'm saying this with understanding... mildly, YTA.\n\nIt's a lot to ask of an adult, let alone a teen ager, but you have to be patient and find better ways to express yourself. And when you get to that breaking point, ask your parents for help - advice on how to talk to your brother, or even to step in and approach him themselves", "You may not be old enough but I have to:\n\n>My little brother and I grab the couch and begin to move it down the stairs\n\nPIVOT PIVOT!!\n\nHonestly its such a soft YTA, it could almost be NAH.\n\nNo need to swear in this context. He was apologizing, all be it for the xth time. \n\nHe felt guilty which is difficult to handle especially at 15.", "YTA.\n\nI thought maybe you weren\u2019t, until you mentioned he\u2019s autistic. At which point, you kind of have been an asshole here. Clearly this experience has been very difficult for your brother to process, and since, as you point out that you\u2019re probably going to be fine, your brother might have been hurt by this more than you. \n\nI have autistic people in my family, and one thing I learned long ago is that you can\u2019t lose patience with their differences, because those aren\u2019t things that they can change, and they aren\u2019t things that will go away. I don\u2019t know exactly how your brother\u2019s autism presents itself, and so I can\u2019t advise you on how you can help him through this state he\u2019s in, where the incident is clearly constantly at the forefront of his mind, but I know that you\u2019re not going to help him through a traumatic event by adding more trauma to it.", "YTA - Your brother is on the spectrum and you curse at him for being sorry after he is visibly upset. Yes he might be apologising a bit too often but just sit him down and reassure him.", "I remember my older brother smashing my head on to floor breaking my nose and spouting blood.  First he laughed then he threatened to kill me if i told Mom. You are NTA, just got a bit annoyed.", "Yta- part of autism is echolia which is the repetition of a certain phrase or question over and over again. You should KNOW this as a sister to someone on the spectrum. It\u2019s a major thing that people on the spectrum deal with and you don\u2019t even know that it seems. If you educate yourself better I don\u2019t think you would be irritated at him\u2026Your brother is autistic (mine too :) and my dad :) and my son :) ) so why you think his brain would just move on without being deeply upset and blaming himself is really AH of you. Your supposed to be on his team and understand that he won\u2019t do and say things how everyone else would. How dare you get annoyed and snap at him instead of just being all upbeat and like it\u2019s not your fault stop it!! I love you it was me too don\u2019t sweat it!!  I\u2019m fine!!

It was an accident, but your brother probably feels really guilty, so it\u2019s understandable he keeps apologising. On the other hand, it\u2019s understandable you were so annoyed and lashed out at him. \n\nAs others have said, tell him that you forgive him and there\u2019s no need to keep apologising.

We still have to live in the real world and not everything has to be wrapped in bubblewrap all the time.", "INFO\n\nHave you forgiven him? There is a difference between you *knowing* he's not to blame, and *feeling* it. \nBeing in constant pain can make that difficult.\n\nIf you did, did you also sit him down to tell him you accepted his apology, that you don't blame him, and he wasn't at fault? (Telling him that when you are annoyed and a bit angrywill not get the message through)\n\nFrom the looks, you didn't, so maybe he feels he has only apollogised enough if you accept it? \n\nIt is also possible that your brother knows people say he's not to blame, but every time he sees you in pain, he doesn't trust that. \nMaybe something like the difference between \"I'm fine\" (I've accepted it happened and will deal with the pain) and \"I'm fine\" (I have no pain) is difficult for him?", "YTA\n\nhe was feeling terrible and you made him feel worse", "I'm gonna say NTA because your parents should be mediating this a little better.\n\nI'm autistic. Something that helped me with figuring out when and how to apologize to people was my dad asking me:\n\n\"Is this apology for them or is it for you?\"\n\nI think your brother would benefit from asking himself that question and then sorta going on a mini personal journey of realizing  that you can't absolve him of the guilt he's feeling right now and then dealing with those feelings without burdening you.\n\nIdeally your parents would be helping him do that or at least telling him to knock it off when he comes to your room.", "When you apologize initially, it's for the benefit of the receiver and the giver. \n\nWhen you incessantly apologize, it's no longer about the receiver. Dealing with the remorse becomes a chore. Now it becomes your job of making them feel better, which is not fair the wronged party. Your forgiveness is essentially rejected and then compelled to be given again. It's not right. \n\nSince he's family and on the spectrum, he deserves a little patience I think. If this has been going on for awhile, then NTA. A boundary should be made. It's time to grow from the absolved guilt, as long as it is clear you're no longer harboring negative feelings. \n\nThis can be more easily applied to someone not on the spectrum, but since they are, take my verdict with a grain of salt.", "I think NTA. One of my biggest pet peeves is when someone hurts you - even if it\u2019s by accident - and then expects you to turn around and comfort them about it. You\u2019ve got a broken rib, you don\u2019t need to spend emotional energy to coddle your brother about it if you don\u2019t want to.

He accidentally broke your ribs and your his brother who he loves deeply. Be kinder to him while reassuring him he has nothing to apologise for. Gentle, unintentional YTA", "Instead of swearing at your brother - give him a big hug and tell him you love him and let him FEEL you are ok. Grow an ounce of compassion, it'll improve your life", "YTA. Your brother deserves an apology and a conversation explaining that it is normal to feel badly- you would if the situation was reversed and he was hurt, because he cares. You appreciate his concern but by you having to console him repeatedly, it puts all your energy focusing on helping him feel better when you were the one injured. His being upset out of proportion to the situation was causing more stress, but a lot of this is beyond his natural capacity to comprehend as easily as neurotypical person would. Have some grace for each other and move on.", "YTA. In the first place, your little brother should not have been trying to move a couch down the stairs with you. The inevitable happened. You should have waited for someone bigger and stronger to help you. \n\nSecondly, you should not have used that kind of language to your brother. You are annoyed with him because he feels so bad and you are definitely not reassuring him. He knows you are angry and that reinforces his shame and guilt.", "Sometimes, people on the spectrum can benefit from a sequential process: if this, then that. You may be able to help your brother by asking him to do a small \u201cPenance\u201d which will allow him to move through. Ask him to take on a chore of yours while your ribs are sore, or take the dog for a walk. \n\nThis sounds a bit weird, but the activity can assuage the guilt.", "Great attitude, terrible execution.

Life is full of situations where someone else is doing something you really don\u2019t like, even if it\u2019s well-intentioned, and it\u2019s important to learn how to either mitigate it or clearly communicate you don\u2019t like it without being angry or hurting their feelings.
