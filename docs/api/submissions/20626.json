My family was moving at the time and our parents were asking us go help move the furniture.\n\nAmongst this furniture was an old kitchen table, a couch, and some bed frames.\n\nMy little brother and I grab the couch and begin to move it down the stairs. It\u2019s a heavy couch and my brother isn\u2019t the strongest. He\u2019s holding the end at the top of the stairs and I\u2019m near the bottom. The couch slipped from his hands and rammed me into the wall. \n\nI wasn\u2019t injured too badly but I still have major pain in my rib cage area. A breakage. It sucks but it was an accident and it happens.\n\nEver since then my brother has been really ashamed of himself. He thinks he\u2019s the reason I hurt so bad. He\u2019s been really annoying since then. He comes into my room to check up on me. That\u2019s cool. \n\nWhat isn\u2019t cool is his constant apologizing. His constant it\u2019s my fault attitude. He can\u2019t go a moment without seeing me without feeling bad that a couch crushed me because of him. Last night  he was in my room with me and he cried about how it\u2019s his fault.\n\nI\u2019m sick of this. Yes the couch slipped from his hands but the same could have happened to anyone. The whole reason I had him grab the end at the top of the stairs was actually because I feared the couch would slip from my hands and crush him at the bottom. \n\nAgain, it could have happened to anyone. I got sick of his crying to I told him that his blame myself attitude needs to fuck off forever. It\u2019s better I get crushed instead of my little bro. It was an accident and I told him to fucking get over it. \n\nHe left the room and I didn\u2019t see him until the morning when the family sat down for breakfast. He didn\u2019t look at me but at his food the whole time. After breakfast my mom speaks to me alone. Brother told her about what I said and that I just made him cry even more and that I need to be more careful with my words. My brother is on the spectrum and more sensitive to words like that than others.\n\nPerhaps mom is right but I\u2019m just sick of my brother\u2019s constant blame myself attitude.

Your brother is not the asshole, it could have happened to anyone.\n\nYour brother being on the spectrum is likely (not assuming anything here, but it's a common symptom) incredibly sensitive to someone being mad or disappointed in him. He probably thought you were mad at him but hiding it not to hurt his feelings. Then, when you actually got mad, his thought likely got confirmed.\n\nI'm not on the spectrum, but my best friend is. If something like this had happened between us, I would have sat her down, asked her how she thought she made me feel, then explain to her how I actually feel. Make her, or in your case your brother, truly understand you're not mad, you never were, and there truly is no need to apologize. Calm and rational is the golden ticket here. Try to leave emotions out the window.", "Info: have you told him that you forgive him and that you know he's sorry, he doesn't need to keep saying it because you know, and it's making it harder when he repeats it?\n\nTelling him it could have happened to anyone isn't the same as telling him you forgive him.", "Swearing at your brother won\u2019t help anything either, you know.  If you want this to get better for both your sakes, maybe suggest to your mom that his guilt is disrupting both your lives enough that he needs to talk this through with a therapist.

I have a disability that makes it easy to injure me (and potentially seriously), so I completely hear you on how obnoxious it gets when someone feels so guilty over hurting you that it\u2019s overwhelming, but the kind of anger you turned on your brother won\u2019t fix anything - it\u2019ll just make him feel even more guilty (because now he\u2019s upset you on top of injuring you) as well as being hurt by your words.", "Look, you're 17, you're injured, you're probably under a lot of stress with the move, and you have a brother on the spectrum.

I\u2019ve done my research on autism and I already know that I would snap if it were constant apologies. OP is young, he\u2019s learning how to deal with his own stress (source: literally the same boat lol, feelings are complicated)\n\nYes my rating is an extremely soft YTA, but it\u2019s really only because of the swearing for me. Him being annoyed is something completely reasonable, however, and he can express this calmly and more reasonably because preparing this kid for the world outside his home is still necessary as well.\n\nedit: fixed the pronouns, my b", "Sorry what?", "Why are you saying she, OP literally wrote 17m.

Sometimes you have to have more patience to explain things than you would normally. If this was my brother, I probably would've sat him down and said \"it's not your fault, it's not my fault, it's the couches fault for being so dang heavy\" I inject a little obvious humor bc sometimes it helps him realize \"if she's joking then it must be ok\"\n\nBut unfortunately you also have to realize he may not feel better about it until you feel better", "NTA.\n\nBut since he\u2019s on the spectrum, I would give him something he CAN do/say to show that he\u2019s sorry/making it up to you. Right now he\u2019s anxious and doesn\u2019t know how to make those feelings go away. Self-soothing is a skill that can be hard for neurodivergent people. \n\nSo tell him that you did not mean to make him feel bad. He can apologize *one more time*, and he needs to think about everything he needs to say, and say it once. Then no more apologies. Instead of, \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d, he can say, \u201cI\u2019m glad we are both ok\u201d \u201cI was very scared!\u201d \u201cMy brother is a tough guy!\u201d \n\nAlso remind him you are the BIG brother.

Autistic people do better with negative events when they understand the \u201cRules\u201d of how to process and behave. \n\nYou also want to emphasize to him that he learned important lessons. We can learn from bad/scary things for the future. We learned to be careful with heavy things, we learned what to do when someone gets hurt, etc, etc.\n\nAnd, lastly, give him something to do.

You are frustrated because your brother is taking something that, from your perspective, happened to you, and is asking you to do more emotional labor to make him feel better about it. He's effectively making your injury about him, which is unfair and upsetting for you.\n\nThe thing is, to some degree it is also about him. Injuring someone by accident is traumatizing, and it's natural for your brother to feel a lot of guilt and have trouble processing it. Since he's young and on the spectrum, he probably doesn't understand yet that helping him process it is not your job. Your parents should be addressing this and getting him therapy so he doesn't constantly harass you to reassure him. It sounds like they are not dealing with it at all, maybe because they weren't aware of it until you blew up at him.\n\nI would start by sitting down with your parents, explaining the situation, and telling them that your brother's obsessive need to apologize is making your recovery worse, not better, and that you would like them to get him help for this because you can't help with it anymore.", "I\u2019m wondering if the kid is struggling with toxic masculinity internet things and sees himself as a failure as a man because he not only dropped furniture (which strong manly men don\u2019t do according to Tate and others) but also got someone hurt in the process.", "NTA.

Tell him you don't blame him and that he really should stop blaming himself.", "As an older sister of roughly the same age, and considering your little brother is on the spectrum, id have to say yes, YTA. \nI understand why it would annoy you, but telling him to fuck off was uncalled for, and to me personally cruel to a sibling who, for once in this sub, isn't acting like a little devil.", "NAH... I want to give you both a hug from this Internet Mom... This is LOVE", "At the very least, he needs to talk it through with someone who isn't OP. When someone hurts you and then you have to comfort them, it means you have to minimize your own pain and focus on theirs. And that sucks. It lead to a toxic cycle where you both pile more pain onto each other until bad things happen.\n\nOP needs a safe space to admit that what happened to him did in fact kinda suck, and he doesn't have to act like a tough guy about it. OP's brother needs a safe space where he can be comforted and reassured that even though what happened sucked, it really wasn't all that bad in the grand scheme of things. And neither of them can provide the other with this, it needs to come from a third party."]}
