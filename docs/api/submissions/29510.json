It's right. NTA", "I understand it was your mothers but as you have learned, it won't go with you when you pass. Why bother making it a big ordeal? I understand that it means a lot to you but it may mean that much to them as well. Materials come and go. Memories stay. NTA.", "NTA. Lock it in your safe. You absolutely won't get it back if she gets her paws on it.", "NTA. If your uncle meant to give it to her he would have. If she's saying she wants it then go with your gut feeling that she intends to keep it and don't let her use it.", "NTA. I hate the phrase \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d bc you always get the shorter end of the stick. ISSA NO! She won\u2019t give it back and you know it which is why your intuition is blowing a gasket.", "Perhaps you would be the bigger person to let your sister wear the necklace, but you would also be the person who will never see the necklace again.   (The stories about how the real necklace was promised to her are kind of a tip-off.)\n\nNTA", "NTA for leaving it at home. It was gifted to you.\n\n\"Needless to say, I am extremely hesitant to give her the necklace. I have a gut feeling I will never get it back.\"\n\nNo kidding. You will likely never get it back. \n\nHonest question tho - do you know that your mother wanted you to have it instead of your other two sisters? You say you thought she was buried in it? Maybe your sister gets a turn with the real necklace her mother actually wore? I can understand not feeling the same way about a replica, tbh. If you DO feel the replicas are equivalent, maybe you can wear a replica for a few years while your sister has the other one? \n\nI don't know, family jewelry is a strange situation.", "NTA DON'T DO IT!!!! DON'T DO IT!! DO NOT DO THAT!!! Keep the necklace in a safe place and tell her it's not touring at this time, then thank her for her interest.", " NTA. you will never get it back", "NTA and I am certain your gut feeling is correct. If you give to her she will never give it back.", "Get a replica of the original made with the inscription. Use less carat stones/metal to make it affordable but make it look as similar to the original as you can. Then give that to her and say nothing.\n\nNTA", "Nta, I can see why your uncle gave it to you and not your sisters.", "That\u2019s a bit of a stretch. Kinda like saying \u201cI\u2019ve read way too many horror stories of young black men committing violent gun crimes. Therefor all young black men should be treated like criminals.\n\nIn your words any sibling who wants to wear sentimental jewelry on their wedding day is a thief, even when no evidence is given to suggest what you think will happen is going to occur.\n\nMost of the AITA stories you\u2019re referring to had one glaring difference: the person wanting to steal the jewelry had already made attempts to steal it.", "This is the best solution, OP", "Thank you - I hate that saying and all other platitudes.", "Oh please.  Her sister has taken every other items of her mom's that they have.  All the other jewelry, photos, journals.  Everything.  This is the one item that OP has.  So her sister should get everything?", "Did you even read the OP? I\u2019m guessing not.\n\nOP\u2019s twin sister \u201chas made comments in the past about how she wants the real one. Even concocting stories about how my uncle \u2018promised\u2019 it to her when she gets married.\u201d\n\nIf you can\u2019t see the obvious warning signs, then you have my sympathy. You must get taken advantage of an awful lot. There is no stretch here, none, to assume that if OP \u201clends\u201d it, she will never see it again.\n\nAfter this, you should read the OP before commenting.\n\nAnd you must be reading jewelry stories that I haven\u2019t. The ones I\u2019m thinking of don\u2019t include \u201cattempts to steal it,\u201d but they do include demands for it. The half-sister-in-law in the story I mentioned didn\u2019t attempt to steal it, though she made several demands for it.", "It\u2019s happened so many times on here, especially with family heirlooms. In situations like these it is better to be safe than sorry.", "Leave it at home.\n\nyour sister won't give it back.\n\nand this is why your uncle gave you the 'real' one. because your sister has everything else.", "That\u2019s worth putting in your post.", "Oof. That's rough. Then I guess I would ask myself, what would my mom want me to do? \n\nI inherited all my mom's jewelry when she passed away, but she never told me how she wanted me to use it. I have lent out or given a few pieces away over the years, but I always first ask myself if I think my mom would agree with the decision. (Then again, I've kept my most particular faves to myself, so it's not exactly the same as what you're facing.)\n\nI don't have a judgement, and I don't have any other advice. But I don't envy your position. I hope it works out in a way that you're comfortable with and is positive for your relationship with your sister.", "You\u2019re taking those statements out of context. That was in regards to her telling her sister to wear the replica to the wedding, her sister said no she wants to wear her mothers necklace to the wedding and that their uncle promised she\u2019d get to wear it for her wedding too.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing atypical about that. My SIL and all her cousins have worn their grandmas necklace on their wedding day. All their moms did as well, despite only one person owning it. Nobody stole it and I guarantee you they would have said they want the real one and it was promised to them if they were offered a replica instead.\n\nYou literally linked to a story that had previous theft attempts, and I called it out before even following your link lol", "More like trying manipulate her way into getting the password. But honestly people seem to go extra crazy for stuff that is meaning like this, and everything's on YouTube.", "I don\u2019t think op should be made to feel guilty about keeping something she was given. If they had a good, trusting relationship I could understand but it really sounds like OP\u2019s sister is not planning on giving the necklace back.", "At this point, you're embarrassing yourself.\n\nNo, there is nothing in the OP that says she was \"promised\" it for the duration of the wedding. She only said that her uncle \"promised\" it to her when she got married. Nothing was suggested about her returning it when the wedding was over. That is a deliberate distortion on your part.\n\nAnd, of course, the twin says that she wants the real one. Nothing OP said suggested that she \"wants to real one\" to wear for the wedding. Only that she \"wants the real one,\" period. Another deliberate distortion.\n\nAnd finally, the story I linked includes not a single theft attempt, let alone \"theft attempts.\"\n\nI'm curious, though. Is lying your usual go-to tactic when you try to score points in a debate?\n\nOr is admitting you're wrong such a horrible thing for you, that you'd rather tell lies than just admit you're wrong?", "Not making a comment on either side of the argument but it\u2019s pretty easy to say you would do something when you don\u2019t actually have to do it. OP can easily say that because she got the real one, it doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s what would actually happen. \n\nThere is a huge difference between inheriting something important and sentimental and being given a copy of something your sibling inherited.", "You'd need a reference, I think, for this to work. Unless they have a high-resolution picture of the inscription, or the original to copy, I can't really see how they'd manage that bit of sleight-of-hand."]}
