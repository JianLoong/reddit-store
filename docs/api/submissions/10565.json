He is letting them and their needs and wants be placed in front of your child and your needs.\n\nThey need to have a come to jesus moment. Your husband is enabling them currently. They need to face the hard consequences of their actions and your family needs to be protected. He should have them sign a lease that clearly defines expectations and rent payments. They are taking advantage of your family, and your husband is letting them. He needs to establish hard boundaries and if they don't do what they agreed to, they need to be kicked out/evicted. He has to be willing to follow through on this.", "NTA 1000 times over.  Here is how to fix this:\n\n1.) First of all, the older BIL is harming and endangering your daughter, and is hounding you for money.  Also he curses at you.  No fucking way do you accept this.  He has to go NOW.  Your child is the most important person in this scenario, and the vape pen and the scolding are unacceptable.  The treatment of you in your own home is unacceptable.  Out.  Tomorrow.  Protect your kid.\n\n2.) Second, the younger BIL isn't harming your daughter but is turning your house into a pigsty, isn't keeping his word to help out, and is causing you to spend time cleaning up after him.  Maybe after he sees the older BIL thrown out, he'll get that he needs to straighten up.\n\nWrite out a list of things younger BIL is expected to do.  Put it into contract form.  If he has finished school (or if he's working while attending school), demand rent.  It doesn't have to be much but he has to contribute.  Give him a month to comply.  If he hasn't complied, he's out.  Let him go join his mother in another state.  Bye-bye.\n\n(Also, if you simply want privacy in your own home, to which you're entitled, he could be the nicest person in the world and you still wouldn't have to keep him living with you.  Help him find another living situation and get him out of your home.)\n\n3.) Third, you have a husband problem, and it's a serious one.  He has allowed this situation to fester and doesn't seem to have the interest or the backbone to fix anything, despite its impact on you and, most importantly, your daughter.  Perhaps you can use the money you save feeding and taking care of older BIL, who should be gone TOMORROW, to pay for some couple's therapy.  Your husband's apparent apathy and passivity in this situation are unhealthy and impact you very negatively.  He needs to fix this.", "NTA - When you and your husband got married, you made vows to each other to put each other\u2019s needs first in your lives.  When you had your child and chose to raise her, you and your husband accepted the obligation to provide her with a loving, peaceful, safe home where she can play and grow.\n\nYour BILs are not your responsibility.  Your BILs are not your husband\u2019s responsibility.  Your CHILD is your responsibility.\n\nIt is completely understandable that you and your husband want to help your brothers.  \n\nHowever, you both did not understand that the 17 yr old, needed a parent, not a brother.  He isn\u2019t listening to you, he is not treating you like a parent.  While he is almost an adult, he is acting like an irresponsible teenager.   He needs consequences for his actions.  Teenagers test limits to see what the adults in their life are going to do.  If you let it go (ignore) or admonish, the teen has not suffered consequences for his bad behavior, so he is going to do it again and probably escalate.  You and your husband need to hold him accountable for his behavior and apply consequences when he behaves badly.  You and your husband have something he wants, your house because it allows him to finish school in his high school.  If he refuses to follow the rules, the warning can be, follow the rules or we are sending you back to your mother, and yes, you will have to finish high school somewhere else or she will have to drive you to your old school.\n\nThe 26 yr old, is an adult and responsible for his own decisions.  You can\u2019t make him behave well.  A recovering addict with anger issues should NOT be living in a house with a 3 yr old.  His anger issues could get your child hurt, and if your child is hurt in an incident, it will be investigated and you and your husband will be deemed irresponsible for allowing a recovering addict with anger issues to live in your home with your tender age child.  Do you understand the gravity of what I am saying?  As an adult, you can\u2019t make your BIL, make good decisions.  He needs to want to make good decisions.  \n\nHelping someone does not mean that you set yourselves on fire to keep them warm.  Helping someone may mean finding them a living situation that is tailored to their needs.  It may mean giving the, some money for the deposit on a place where they can start to rebuild their life.\n\nYou have a chance with the 17 yr old because he is still a minor.  You can make him follow the rules by threatening to send him back to his mom\u2019s if he doesn\u2019t comply.  But I have to ask, what is your plan for after graduation?? What is his plan to become self sufficient and get his own place?  Are you intending to let him stay?  Have you and your husband thought about the rules for him staying??  Are you and your husband ready to parent a 17 yr old or a newly minted high school graduate?  Have you been working with him on his plans post graduation??\n\nThe 26 yr old needs to go.  He is a danger to your child.  If something happens to your child, you and your husband will be deemed unfit parents for allowing the situation.  You have a recovering addict with known anger issues living in your house with a tender age child.\n\nYour husband needs to rethink his definition of help and his priorities.  He is risking his child\u2019s well being for an adult brother who makes bad decisions and isn\u2019t improving on his decision making process.", "I don't understand why your husband isn't helping more with cleaning. Even if he has a job he should be doing more. The biggest problem is your husband since he refuses to address their bad behavior. You need to talk to him and maybe give an ultimatum. I bet if you and your child went away for a week he'd be upset because the house would be a mess and there'd be no prepared meals. If he really wanted to help he would. He's obviously not a pushover with you; he is letting his brothers treat you badly and he's choosing not to stand up to you. NTA", "NTA. Why isn\u2019t your husband helping to enforce the rules in the home? It sounds like time he grows a spine and tells them to help out and respect you, the rules, and the house, or its time for them to move out.", "NTA, but this doesn't really seem like something there are two sides of. They are disrespecting your home and your family and negatively affecting you, your daughter, and your bank accounts! And they are endangering your daughter--leaving a vape pen out for her to get is pretty shitty. She's not going to die, but that is still a hard line.\n\nAs far as the older brother--drug problems are awful, but he needs to go. You could barely handle the one and being responsible for him, his finances, and keeping him off drugs is too much to expect of you. I think you have to be more considerate with the 17 year old--both because he's a minor and you're his guardian and also because 17 year olds can just be dicks. That doesn't excuse his behavior though. You do need to set some serious rules with consequences though--if he can't behave and respect you all, he can move to his mother's and lose his school and his friends.", "NTA, but you have a husband issue, not a BIL(s) issue. Your priority HAS to be your young daughter. If your husband won't set and hold reasonable boundaries, like \"clean up after yourself, pitch in with chores around the house, and DON'T LEAVE DRUGS OUT FOR OUR 3 yo TO FIND\" then you need to find a different living situation.\n\nSit your husband down and let him know he is in danger of losing his wife and daughter unless he steps up and becomes a real partner. His family is the issue, so its up to him to take the lead on this.\n\nAnd document everything going on, including the careless drug use, so you can gain full custody of your baby girl.", "NTA.  Each B-I-L should be working towards a specific plan for being able to take care of themselves including a timeline.  They should each contribute towards the home. If they don't have money or jobs, they should take on more of the housework.\n\nHaving an open-ended living arrangement without specifics isn't working for you and they're just taking advantage at this point. You don't have to put them out on the streets, but you should create a contract with the details. (Looking for job, out of house by x/y/z date, daily or weekly chores list.). Your husband should hold them accountable.", "Do you know what \"\"ANGER ISSUES\"\" is??? he isn't mature enough to act like an adult. At 26 and in recovery he should be doing meetings daily and getting a job allowing him to hide in his room and act like a juvenile is not helping him ONE LITTLE BIT. HE IS BEING CODDLED like a baby WAKE UP HE NEEDS DISCIPLINE HE NEEDS RULES. HE HAS ONE WEEK TO FIND A JOB OR HE IS DROPPED OFF AT THE NEAREST SHELTER. You two are harming his recovery but not making him act like an adult. If he can \"\"VAPE\"\" he can pay bills. Demand better. The other one has to graduation to act better or he is gone. He needs a set of rules to follow also. This is your house set your husband down and make rules. Do not let them GASLIGHT YOU. RULES AND CONSEQUENCES. THIS IS YOUR HOUSE DEMAND BETTER. TWO BOYS HAVE TWO SETS OF RULES WITH THEM GOING OUT THE DOOR IF THEY DO NOT SHAPE UP. PROTECT YOUR CHILD THAT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY", "NTA.  You need to lose these guys asap.  Not a healthy environment for your child.", "NTA. Keep the younger brother around since he's still a minor and you agreed to take care of him through high school. Lose the other brother if he's not going to appreciate what's being done for him.", "Nta. Tell your husband that you're done. Either they leave or you and your daughter do. Period.", "NTA. Your husband needs to grow a spine and get in front of this ASAP.  These two need to go right now.  They are not good roommates or family members and you should not have to deal with them.

Without setting boundaries for these folks (rent, food, board, etc.) you're going to have issues.  Then get in agreement and stick to them.", "NTA sit your husband down and explain the toll their behavior is taking on you and that he a) addresses it with them and they modify their behavior b)  you will be kicking them out if he doesn't and they don't or c) you will be moving out.", "You have 3 juveniles who disrespect you.\n\n\u2018Your husband isn\u2019t a pushover.

Leaving him over this is not something I would consider as I don't find that necessary. \n\nI do, however, feel that he gives his brothers many more allowances than he should, and it is negatively impacting our marriage.
