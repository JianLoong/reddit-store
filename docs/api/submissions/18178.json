It\u2019s also a good day for her to take the outdoor furniture she needs out and set it up how she\u2019d like. \n\nShe wants you to turn the cameras off while you leave the key outside somewhere? That seems sketchy to me. What if someone gets the key before her and steals/damages property? Does she plan on doing/bringing something in the house that she would want to hide from you? My security cams are on even when I\u2019m home, just in case something happens.

So If you show up, just know you will be turned away.*\n\nMake sure you leave the cameras on because your sister is likely going to show up and attempt to break in if she is the kind of person this post makes her out to be.  If I were you, I'd talk to the local sheriffs and clue them in on the family drama and that you may end up having to call them...so you wanted to give them a heads up.
