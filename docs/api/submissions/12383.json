It has nothing to do with you judging her culture or not accepting her.", "NTA. I married into an Indian family and I have never, ever heard of this happening with an adult child. Hand-feeding? Yup, that seems to be pretty common, though even that's unusual in adulthood (most children are handfed at some point, often well after they're capable of eating on their own). But bathing? That'd make my brain come to a screeching halt, too.", "NTA this is some weird shit. Just be mindful if ya'll ever have kids, this will be a thing with them too.", "This is very strange and quite concerning behavior. Nothing wrong with calling it weird, NTA", "NTA. Your girlfriend's reaction says she knows it's weird and wrong and is probably brain washed by her mother into thinking it's normal.", "She needs to go to therapy or at least recognize how inappropriate that is and stop. If not you should break up with her because this is so incredibly creepy and fucked up.", "NTA, but be aware that your GF at this point probably genuinely doesn't understand it's not normal.", "I\u2019m Indian (f) and no, that\u2019s not normal; absolutely no one I know does that beyond childhood.

That\u2019s just weird.", "NAH but then of course I am finnish, and I would easily bathe my mother in a traditional sauna. It is for getting clean. Not everything is about sex.", "NTA Indian-American, so not by personal experience but in my mom\u2019s generation this was not unusual for situations like helping the bride get bathed/ready, the idea being that she shouldn\u2019t have to lift a finger (probably for the last time in her life\u2026) and to keep her henna undisturbed. Then kids or maybe someone who is hurt.  It would be weird to do this for no reason. I think her mom is infantilizing her and she just thinks it\u2019s normal", "That's a nope for me", "NAH - To me that sounds incredibly weird, but if your gf doesn't find it weird and it is in their culture, who is it really harming?

Not cultural at all, more like what everybody else is saying of it being some form of control.\n\nThink your gf need to try and break free of her parents cause it seem like this is headed to where your gf and her parents well have a symbiotic relationship and they well never let her break free.", "NTA for thinking something you don't recognise is weird but I'm an Indian-American woman and I can say that I don't find it incredibly weird. The context might be very different with the controlling parents but it's not unheard for women in a family to bathe together/help each other bathe, it just depends on the community. I'm not comfortable being naked in front of others so I haven't done communal bathing but I will on occasion ask my mom to wash my hair and do some other hair rituals like oiling and such. It really does depend on the situation of the family but from my perspective, it seems like her defensive nature is a little justified bc wouldn't you be defensive if your partner found out something about you and found it weird and tried to google it instead of being understanding. Communal bathing and being naked in front of the same sex and even being bathed by the same sex people in your family is a fairly common practice in many parts of the world, especially in Asia. I would take a minute to question why you found this specific thing to be so \"weird\" and uncomfortable. And if you want resources on communal bathing/being bathed by family members, there's def resources out there, unsure why you were unable to find anything.", "I would have ended things there and then.

It was to break his temperature, he felt more comfortable wearing his underwear and I laid a wash cloth over his lap for extra privacy. \n\nNta I\u2019m confused by this. I\u2019m not from the culture but as parent. I\u2019m not understanding why.", "I think YTA.  It depends on the definition of bath. When I was in my late teens,  early 20s. If I was very upset about something.  I would take a bath. My mom wash my hair and back. We would talk about what was wrong. It just made me feel emotionally safe. In saying that. It would be creepy if she washed my privates and such", "NTA. She knows it's weird and that's why she got so defensive at your confusion", "NTA - I was dating a man in college and then I discovered that he only let his mother wash his hair.  He was in his 20s and didn't know how to wash his own hair.\n\nHe was great in bed but I knew the relationship had no future.  His mother was possessive in a strange way over her one and only chic.  He would need to live independently and could only marry when she had gone to her eternal reward.", "NTA if she is capable of bathing herself this is weird and i don;t think it's a cultural thing", "Say what? NTA, but I think her parents are.  I don't think I would have been able to hide my \"WTF\" expression if a friend told me that her mother bathed her once she grew up unless said friend physically could not do it herself. Since you also said that her parents are toxic and controlling, this is probably the mother's way of making sure that daughter is not doing something that parents do not approve of. If that is the case, not sure if I would ever want to marry into this family because I would be concerned about the type of control they would they try to retain even after she married and to what extreme would they go to keep that control. Especially since GF doesn't seem to see anything wrong with this really weird practice.", "That\u2019s very weird and troubling, almost scary! She probably doesn\u2019t even realize how weird it is! My mind went straight to abuse when I read that!!!!!", "If she s adamant about this as a cultural thing, any children the two id you may have if you will be bathed by her well into adulthood.\n\nAsk her to show you that this is a cultural norm in India.  If she can\u2019t ask her who then told her it was.  Also ask why she insists you will never understand her culture.  There may be trauma and abuse she has been told are normal.", "I hope you end up reading all the comments, because im seeing lots of people say you should show your girlfriend this post, and i want to tell you please do not deliver to her the news this way. If she is truly in denial this will actually be rather sickening to her if she actually has a realization after you make her read this, and doesn\u2019t just adamantly deny it. The realization that your mother bathing you into adulthood is NOT something cultural but is actually abusive would not be an easy pill to swallow. \n\nPlease reach out to local support groups aimed at helping women escape and recognize abusive situations and ask them, as her boyfriend how to proceed. Theyll tell you how. Do not show her the harsh words of strangers in order to reveal to her shes being abused. It will not go well.", "My mind went to \u2018full body check\u2019 like in prison or intensive psych units.", "Outstanding book", "Whoa! That is messed up...", "Yea, first thought was: \u201cwas there a medical condition?\u201d.\nAnything else above a certain age is weird.\n\nVice versa might come again though, bathing their elders when they can\u2019t anymore?"]}
