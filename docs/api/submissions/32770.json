My mom is so great the lack of my father barely bothers me now.", "I really tried for a couple of months to like her and her kids and I did. They were all so sweet and I was happy with it. But when my dad said that I felt bad for all sides of the situation. She probably didn\u2019t want to replace my mom but had my dad pressuring her too. Her kids were being told they have siblings and their mom is now suddenly my mom after only a couple of months. I\u2019m being told my mom doesn\u2019t matter anymore and will be replaced. I decided at that moment that I would remove myself from the situation as a whole to avoid giving everyone a headache.", "Yeah, just in your post above he did about 5 things that raised my eyebrows:\n\n* Showing up with her 3 kids without giving you any notice\n* Floating in and out of your life on his own whims\n* Trying to get you to pressure your brother into a relationship with him\n* Proposing to a woman without telling you, and then inviting the surprise fiance to live with you\n* Insulting your mom in front of you as a joke\n\nHe sounds like someone who lives a very chaotic life because he does things impulsively and he doesn't have the manners to understand everyone else doesn't live that way. Don't let him drag you into the chaos. I'm presuming you're an adult and you can just peace out.", "Good to know there are still people like that walking around.\n\nFriendly advise from a fellow fixer, it's a burden, look after yourself so you don't loose your spark.", "I totally understand how you feel, especially since you not only wanted to support him, but also make efforts to get bond with the step mother yourself. It seems as if he's involved himself too much with her kids, and forgot to look out for his own. Keep your head up, OP. I think you were mature on your side, and respectful of your brothers boundaries too.", "Yea you can't make someone be a parent he's just a selfish narcissist who wants things to work his way", "I definitely get the impression that you tried. I suspect there are other things that you may not even remember that were similar to the things at the end of your post that were bad.\n\nOne of the worst things a parent can do is engage in alienation against the other parent. No matter how much you or I might hate our spouses, talking badly about the spouse to the child(ren) is reprehensible. The obvious exceptions being some sort of physical or sexual assault or other harm of the child.\n\nI'm really sorry you had to endure this.", "That\u2019s so sad. Why can\u2019t your dad just let her be the cool step mum without trying to replace your real mum. It sounds a bit toxic on his part.", "That\u2019s my plan I\u2019m 17 right now and am already cutting contact pretty low. Surprise fiancee moved in a month after he proposed. We met the woman once. We weren\u2019t told anything about who she was either. He used to have friends come in and out of his life and we never really knew them but we\u2019d meet them once or twice it was a weird way to grow up. But when she moved in and we found he proposed that was also a month after he broke up with my mom. So in one after a breakup with the mother of his children he is engaged and to be married.", "I definitely try it\u2019s almost become instinct now like I don\u2019t think about it I just do. I just go through the motions protecting everybody from themselves and any other bad thing out to get them. I do forget about myself in the chaos from time to time but for the most part I\u2019ve found my way of making it all work", "Thank you I try to be my brother is my world and I will protect him no matter what. He is the most important person in my life. It\u2019s a shame my father can\u2019t also see that.", "I wonder this every day when I lay in bed at night. I wonder where it all went wrong.", "I can sum up your father with one sentence   \n\"What is good for me is good for everyone.\".   \n\n\nHe also craves approval, which is weird for a grown ass man.   Why should an adult need ass pats about his relationship choices?   If you weren't consulted beforehand, why should you pat him on the head when he pulls a fait accompli?    \n\n\n*Dumped mom, hooked up with new person, tell me that you think this is all great!*  \n\n\nHouston, we have found the A.", "All the old and jaded things I want to say... but you don't need someone to tell you about life...\n\nHappy to hear you found your place, live your life well, good luck!", "It was wild we just walked in the house one day and she was standing in the kitchen eating a snack like it was a totally normal day. Like she belonged there. I was floored. We met her once for 30 minutes never knew who she was and never talked about her again. Now, she is standing in my kitchen and I don\u2019t even know this woman\u2019s name. I didn\u2019t even recognize her at first and screamed for my dad thinking she was a stranger.\n\nHe just laughed and said \u201cno sweetie this is my fianc\u00e9e we are getting married in 2 months, whatta yah think.\u201d\n\nI thought he was joking it was so crazy.", "NTA\n\nYou are the child. Your father needs to take responsibility for parenting. Your brother\u2019s relationship with his father is not your responsibility.", "NTA I don't know what kind of person his girlfriend is or what kind of relationship you have, but if it's not a negative one then you might want to warn or show her some kind of evidence about who her new boyfriend is because if he treats his own children like this, the people he is supposed to care about most in the world, I can't imagine he treats his partners any better. Although taking such an action may irreparably harm your relationship with your father, but it sounds like he's already on track for that.", "This is the pov of a step-mom: \nI definitely don't agree with what your dad said and how he approached the situation! The shittiest thing to do is bad mouth (even as a joke) the mother of your children in front of them. Everybody knows that people usually divorce because they have misunderstandings, yet it's not a good enough reason to talk shit about your ex wife/husband. \nThat being said, though, I don't think his new girlfriend's goal is to replace your mom - I honestly think she felt like crap hearing that, especially because she already has kids of her own. \nI don't think you're the asshole for saying that to your dad, he should handle it better. My advice is to not take it out on his girlfriend, but definitely explain to your dad everything he makes you feel when he's saying the things he's saying.", "NTA. Sounds horrible.", "After reading that story, it would take a lot to get any lower than that!", "I did that and she told him and now they both call me crazy", "Oh yeah I don\u2019t blame her for a second I honestly thought the same thing right away. I imagined how she possibly felt as mom herself. I can only imagine how uncomfortable that made her. I actually really enjoy her company I find her to be quite kind and caring. I also enjoyed her kids too, they were sweet and kind to me as well. I also immediately wondered how her kids felt hearing that their mom was supposed to replace mine. The whole thing was weird and I felt bad for all parties involved. The only one I didn\u2019t have sympathy for was my father and I made it clear that it wasn\u2019t funny and he isn\u2019t allowed to talk about my mom like that.", "NTA OP", "Well that's a shame but sometimes when you show a dog a mirror they'll just bark at their own reflection.", "You're right. It doesn't matter what happened between him and your mom, that's not your concern. It's never the kids' fault for their parents' divorce. \nDepending how young the other kids are, they could have been excited to have more siblings - if they're young. But I'm pretty sure it's a weird situation for them also, dealing with a new person in their lives. \nI appreciate you for being kind and for keeping an opening mind, and I do encourage you to bring the whole thing up again with your dad. Your opinion and feelings matter!", "They were 10, 11, and 3 \n\nI\u2019ve brought it up a couple of times and now it\u2019s been about a year or two and they are still dating I\u2019m not involved because he wanted nothing to do with after I said it upset me.\n\nNow they\u2019re 14,13, 6", "I'm sorry for the way your dad handles this. It's very shitty, honestly. He can't treat you like this because of something he did!\nYou're definitely not the asshole, so don't feel like one either. \nThere are toxic parent-child relationships, and keeping the distance it's perfectly fine. If your dad chose to do so over his mistake, at least he saved you the effort.", "Where's your mom in all this? You're old enough to go stay with her because the courts will listen to you. NTA Not sure about your brother but if he's old enough, he could do the same.", "We live with her full time, I\u2019m 17 my brother is 14 we both stay with her full time we only ever visited him because her dad moved 4,000 miles away from her so she grew up without a father figure at all and wanted us to have contact with him so we\u2019d have our dad. She knows everything now we mainly kept a lot of this secret in the beginning but we eventually told her and we stay with her.", "Hooley dooley! What a mess!\n\nI get that your mom is trying to be a good parent by giving you something she missed out on - a relationship with two parents.\n\nBut you're going to have to explain to her that she would be doing you and your brother a favour by letting you stop seeing him.\n\nThis guy will do harm. Simply by being himself.\n\nYou can all do math and know he was with the fiance before he left your mom, right?\n\nNTA", "One step a head of you I explained all of this to her I said I sympathize and understand your reasoning but he isn\u2019t the kind of man you want around your kids and she agreed. She\u2019s always said if I didn\u2019t want contact with him then I didn\u2019t have to she just didn\u2019t want to cut him off from us when we younger because of missing out on a father figure in her life. Now though she 100% doesn\u2019t want him around us knowing everything she does."]}
