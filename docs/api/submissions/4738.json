I was a little annoyed she asked tbh cause my brother is perfectly capable of watching everyone, he just doesn't want to. But he uses his weaponized incompetence to his advantage, honestly if I did stay he'd probably just sneak out. I know I was watching my sibs and cousins when I was younger than that so why can't he? reluctantly and with a slight tone said \"sure\" but my mom got pissed and said \"never mind I won't even ask\" and essentially told me to leave her alone. \n\nI've been overthinking it and maybe I shouldn't have had a tone and sucked it up but I really don't see why my brother can't do it. I also worry that this will be a trend where my parents will ask me to do things for them even after I've moved out cause l'm not moving terribly far from them. Aita?\n\nEdit: looking at the comments thus far, I\u2019m grateful for everyones input, one commenter said to mention that prior to his diagnosis and after my dad was emotionally abusive, he\u2019s mellowed out a tiny bit but honestly I don\u2019t think that much to change I am being an AH. \n\nI\u2019ll admit I was very bitter towards my brother cause my mom had babied him and coddled him and he\u2019s avoided a lot of responsibilities because of this. But I think you guys are right that this isn\u2019t a terribly large ask to watch them for a week. \n\nSome of you were very hostile but I see it came from a place of empathy for my parents which I understand and I deserved to hear it. Some of you implied I wasn\u2019t helping out and while it doesn\u2019t change much, I have been helping out, I\u2019ve helped taken my dad to appointments, brought his medications to him when he leaves them at home and I\u2019ve been doing most of the household chores prior to as well.

Sure, you can get off on the technicality that it's not your \"job\" to watch your siblings... but man, your parents are going through something horrific and all they are asking is for you and your siblings to do some very minor things to ease the burden just a tiny little bit... and you guys are just refusing. \n\nYou need to have a serious sit-down talk with your siblings, discuss what is going on, talk about the way you are all feeling and seriously come up with a way to help your parents through this incredibly dark time.

Your mom has probably made the same judgment you have: that the 17 yr old can\u2019t be trusted, so even if you were trustworthy to watch siblings at his age, he isn\u2019t.  You said it yourself.  Your parents aren\u2019t going to be able to make him a better person before the trip.  Help your parents out a little, who are going through an incredibly stressful time.\n\nAs for them asking for help once you\u2019ve moved out, why would that be so terrible? If it becomes an untenable burden, or if your brother isn\u2019t stepping up at all, you can talk to them then about reasonable expectations.

You can refuse for whatever reason you want and you don\u2019t have to provide an explanation so NTA I guess, enjoy being \u201cright\u201d and making a point while your family is going through hell and your mom is holding everything together by the skin of her teeth while her husband is dying and her daughter refuses to help out when asked.", "Is there a compromise? You'll \"watch\" them but your brother has to cook dinner every night and clean up, do his own laundry, etc.? \n\nNormally I'd say NTA, but your dad is dying of cancer.

They\u2019re asking you to sleep in their house, presumably the one you are moving out of, for a week. And so what if they occasionally ask you to do things for them after you\u2019ve moved out.

It looks like other  family members are gathering around to help your mother and for some reason you don't think you should.\nIt's also concerning that you're already worried about doing favors when you move out.

Should your sibling step up? Probably. But would you later regret not having helped your mom because of some pettiness regarding your brother? I would recommend taking your brother out of the equation and do what you feel is right.

You agreed to watch them. You were annoyed about it and had some tone, but you still agreed. Your mom reacted to your tone, likely because of the stress she's under and having hoped that you would be more enthusiastic about helping, but there's nothing wrong with you feeling hesitant about helping watch siblings that should be old enough to take care of themselves.\n\nNTA.\n\nReally, nobody in this situation is the asshole. It's a shitty circumstance to have to deal with all around. It'd be nice if you were more emotionally invested in being helpful and supportive given your dad is dying, but feeling resentful over the fact your brother isn't responsible or reliable enough to be the one in charge is entirely understandable, and you shouldn't be expected to curb that just to avoid having a tone that would upset your mom.", "NTA, I think it was ok to be annoyed at the situation, your brother is old enough to look after the younger sibling and it would be more convenient as well. At the end of the day you still said yes but you was slightly frustrated it had to be you, you are still willing to help them even when it might put you out so I think it was fair. Also it can be a very hard time dealing with cancer so your mother might have overreacted on the phone but that\u2019s probably also acceptable given the circumstances.

She just needs help.", "NTA but perhaps you can come up with some sort of compromise to help certain days of the week? Because you are right, a 17-year-old is completely capable of helping too. Sometimes parents just don't teach their sons how to care for the home, cook, etc. which they would need to hurry up and do before they leave. The only reason I am suggesting this is because of the extenuating circumstances of his cancer. Stepping up to help here is reasonable. You would need to set very clear boundaries ahead of time because you don't want to turn into the auto-babysitter or second (3rd really) parent.

When you are sitting down discussing that you can talk about what things your brother is capable of helping with and you can raise any criticism to his \u201cweaponized incompetence\u201d over specific things. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with saying \u201cI am happy to help out, but I EXPECT/WANT brother to contribute as well by doing X, Y, Z\u201d.

I didn't take note of genders at first, but after reading, I knew you were female. Parents often assume the female child needs to take on childcare and domestic duties while allowing male children to skip that. It's not even a case of being the oldest, because you were doing childcare at 17. \n\nA better solution would be for you and your brother to alternate watching the youngest sibling. It's not fair to put you in charge of everything. I think your aunt should be making alternate arrangements for her own kids. Watching them every night is too much for anyone.

Your mom was fine letting your father abuse the three of you his whole life, but now everyone has to forget anything happened because he's dying. Well, assholes die.\n\nIf you have a good relationship with your siblings, maybe go to help them. But you don't owe your abuser and his enabler anything anymore.

What are the hours at night you would have to watch them ? If your aunt works nights, like 11 pm - 7 am, it sounds like they just want you there to make sure your brother doesn\u2019t sneak out. During those hours, there isnt cooking or chores to do. If this is the case, I\u2019m not saying your the TA for not wanting to. Because, if his intention is to sneak out, I\u2019m not sure how you could stop him. You would be asleep too. And if he won\u2019t listen to your mom if she tells him \u201c don\u2019t go out at night, you need to stay home incase your needed \u201c, I doubt he would listen to you. How old are your cousins ? A 17 year old and 13 year old should be ok to be home alone, but if they are younger, it may be to much for this 17 year old to watch them all. Maybe you could offer to watch them 3 nights a week so it isn\u2019t all on your brother. He may be open to acting responsible if he knows he doesn\u2019t have to be every day. Your aunt is coming to help, but what about your cousins dad ? Is he in the picture ? Could your cousins not stay with him while your aunt helps with your siblings ? And how long are your parents going to be out of state ? If it is a week, it may just be easier to stay there, but make sure your siblings know you are not their babysitter or maid, and they are old enough to help out. If it is months, I understand that you would feel like you have to be a substitute mom to them when they are capable of taking care of themselves because your brother just doesn\u2019t want to, and you are also dealing big emotions of loosing your dad too. I imagine you are also scared that after your dad passes, you will be expected to help everyone else physically, mentally and emotionally just because you are the oldest and it seems like no one cares that you lost your dad too. I\u2019m so sorry for what you are going thru. There are no words that can make it better. I say this as someone who has lost her husband to terminal cancer while we had a young child. You are NTA for not wanting to take responsibility for 2 teenagers who are capable of taking care of themselves. Your brother may also be scared that once dad dies, he will suddenly have to be responsible and be \u201c the man of the house \u201c. ( when ppl told my son this, I flipped out. His only job is to be a little boy. I am the parent, it is my job to be the parent and take care of him. ) You should sit down with your brother, and discuss this with him. Let him know that his feeling are ok, and you don\u2019t expect him to grow up overnight because of this. But that you all need to come together and help a bit. Offer to watch all the younger ones 3 nights a week of he is willing to watch them 2 nights a week. I assume your aunt works 5 days a week and can watch them the other 2 nights. After you have talked to your brother, both of you go to your mom, and explain that you have had a good talk and reached a compromise together to help out during this time.", "Info: why don't you guys come up with a compromise?

She's had to take on the responsibility for providing for the family, keep the house running, and getting Dad to and from treatments. The mental load is completely on her and she has no effective partner to share it with right now.\n\nShe just needs something easy, for once. Brother refused and that sucks, but then OP got stroppy on top of it and that was when Mum reached her breaking point. She just wants to get something done with minimal fuss and argument and apparantly neither of her two eldest children are capable of doing this.\n\nThe attitude is what makes OP the AH. Just do this thing for Mum without arguing, and ignore the fact that brother is getting away with being petulant.", "I was wondering this. Auntie needs to secure her own childcare now that OP\u2019s family is unable to help.", "I got the feeling that aunt was going out of her way to watch them during the day but had to work nights. Maybe the cousins are young, so her getting them sorted at their house and putting them to bed etc for OP would make sense. Then it is a smooth transition for OP to take over for the nights.", "This is a 17m and a 13f they are capable of helping themselves. The fact that the 17 year refuses to help by being lazy is ridiculous.\n\nNAH: I read your previous post about your dad. Seems like everyone is in a tough boat. See if you can talk to your mom and see what you can do. You said your dad is having mood swings and they are making his already bad behavior worse.", "But their 17yo brother was asked first and he just doesn't want to! OP doesn't live in the same area anymore!", "I agree. Dad and mum not having to worry about what's going on at home is one less thing for them to worry about. They have enough on their plate. My heart goes out to them.", "Again OP said sure her mom got pissed because she said it with an attitude. OP did not say no", "You're having some strong reactions, so maybe you missed the fact that the 17yo bro declined to do it just cuz.", "The 17yo brother is more than old enough to see to the younger sibling. The OP is probably starting a new job and can't afford to take time off easily.", "Terminal cancer doesn't always mean immediately dying. It just means that treatment can only postpone death not take away the cancer. Depending on the type and how responsive to treatmemt, people can live several years so OP does have a right to be worried about future.\n\nThat said, it does vary and worth asking oncologist the exact type and prognosis. Some move very fast. And the initial treatmemt is worst as everything changing and very scary. I think OP is YTA (mild) as her parents likely feel they are drowning at moment but once things stablish, then a debate about expectations is useful.\n\nEveryone is dying. Cancer, esp terminal cancer, moves up the due date.", "If the 17 year old is purposely doing this to not have to have any responsibilities that is because he is the AH here. OP said sure she might have had an attitude but she did say yes. Her mom got pissed because of the attitude.", "A 17 year old and 13 year old are old enough to take care of themselves plus watch cousins no she's adult with their own life and responsibilities the sister can stay home and watch everyone if she wants to be supportive", "Everyone on here seems to think that OP said no. She said yes but had a tone which pissed off her mom. Mom is going through alot and I think was looking for someone responsible, and is already annoyed that the 17 year old can or will not help. I say its NAH tough situation but OP never said no.", "She didn't say no to watching them.", "Because the parents have enough stress and worry. Let's add more stress to their plate. If the 17 year old is untrustworthy why wouldn't the parents want an adult keeping an eye on things. \nCan you imagine mum going with dad to get treatment and then on top of it worrying about what's going on at home?", "They might not need to be actively babysat, but they're going through an incredibly emotional time - their father is actively dying, their mom is away with for his treatment, and they're teenagers on top of it, which is already hard. Wouldn't you want an adult with them if they're going to be alone for a week? Especially overnight, when anxieties can really take over. Even if they're handling this better than any teenager I've ever met, maybe they need someone overnight so that their already overtaxed parents don't have to add one more worry to their plates.", "See the thing is everyone keeps blasting OP for not just jumping and doing it. She knows what her family is going through, and it owuld be nice if everyone pitched in. 17 years old is not too young to take some responsibility in helping the family it does not give him an excuse for not learning to do for himself.", "> I also worry that this will be a trend where my parents will ask me to do things for them even after I've moved out cause l'm not moving terribly far from them.", "She must certainly does live in the same area. She said she\u2019s not moving far from them. Not living in the same house doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t help out any more.", "Right but he isnt an adult and she is. Her mother asked her for a reason. Its the absolute least she can do.", "17yo is 17. It's not \"weaponized incompetence\", he's not mature enough to take care of a 13 year old kid and his cousins.", "OP said that she did agree but did have a tone, but its not like she said no. Her mom got pissed because of the tone.", "I saw that. And that\u2019s between him and his mother - let her deal with the attitude. And yes I have strong reactions because I can\u2019t stand people who won\u2019t help family in a time of need. The OP is 24. A 24 year old should be more mature. The idea that she shouldn\u2019t help her family, one with a dying parent, with the basic task of sleeping at their house for a week is gross.", "As a father i would not let my17 year old child watch little children overnight for a few days unsupervised. Now a 20+ year old I have no issues. In this scenario the 17 year old should be helping at the most and not causing problems at the least. \n\nMy parents where never home since my brother is a olympic level athlete. When I was 17 if my parents brought the younger kids then I could stay home by myself. If it was an overnight and they would be back the next day then I would watch them. If they where goin to be gone for 2 to 7 days then my grandma would always come and watch the kids. She was to handle the kids and I was to take care of myself unless my grandma needed help.", "[removed]", "17 is a child. They can help but they certainly can't PARENT and manage 1-3 younger children.", "First, no one said the 17 year old can't.  But he isn't.  Second, no one requested that the OP take time off of work.  They requested she stay at the house at night. Since she is moving not very far away from her parents' home, she could still get to work.", "My parents had 5 cancers between the two of them, including pancreatic, plus I had my own scare, but thanks for the lecture. OP is not worried for the future except if she is inconvenienced. She has the mentality of \u201cI am all grown up and moving out, so I shouldn\u2019t be responsible any more for what happens in their house.\u201d", "A mature 13 and 17 year are old enough to take care of themselves. Just because you reach a certain age doesn't mean you should be left without parental supervision. The sister will be home during the day she's just asking for the daughter to stay at night.", "She gave her mother attitude with the yes. Her mother recognized that her daughter didn\u2019t want to help. I can only imagine how mom felt in that moment. And now she\u2019s on Reddit complaining that she doesn\u2019t want her family \u201cstarting a trend\u201d asking for help.", "I see that, too. It's not a simple answer of telling her she should jump in and manage everything in her family. Everyone is in crisis. The siblings are teenagers and should be mostly able to manage themselves. The 3 of them, if they get along reasonably well, can keep things going on their own. \n\nThe aunt doesn't need to be staying there during the day when the teens are in school anyway, and OP shouldn't have to take on additional responsibility of her cousins at this time. \n\nThis doesn't need to be as chaotic as it is, but I suspect emotions are running high.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

But this is reddit and when cancer comes your the asshole for not dropping and selling everything. Also OP has a post about the relationship with her dad which is kinda eye opening to whats going on in the family. So situation is already tense.", "There are certain subjects on Reddit where the masses rally, regardless of the situation. It's an accurate study on predictable human behaviors, for sure."]}
