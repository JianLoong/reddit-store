I\u2019d have more sympathy in the event the style was extremely low cut & it didn\u2019t fit a busty woman or something of that nature. Simply hating the colour? Deal with it. It\u2019s one day & she didn\u2019t have to pay for it.", "NTA give her two options \n\n- Wear the dress. It's one day. Pink isn't going to make her suddenly turn into Elle Woods. \n\n- Don't wear the dress and come as a guest or don't attend, her choice\n\nIf you give in on one thing she's just going to keep throwing tantrums.

Wear it or don't be in the bridal party.  Those are the choices\"", "NTA - I'd ask her to step down from the wedding party, because her behavior is adding a ton of unnecessary stress.  Also, as a bridesmaid, it is completely expected that you WEAR THE DRESS COLOR THAT IS PICKED FOR YOU.  This is like the number one criteria of being a bridesmaid.  \n\nAnd without a doubt, she's being an insufferable brat, and your parents are enabling the behavior.  It's not as if the dress is physically uncomfortable; she's not being asked to dye her hair or cover tattoos; and she's not being asked to wear a dress when she presents male.  No, she's throwing a tantrum over a color like a toddler who wants the red sippy cup instead of the blue one.  You're about to be a full-on adult, and this is a great opportunity to assert yourself.", "NTA. Don't budge. She is being so selfish and ridiculous. It's YOUR wedding day and she is making it about herself. She seriously can't suck it up and wear pink for one day? If she wants to make a fool of herself and back out of the wedding over something so childish and stupid, let her. She'll be the one regretting it when she looks back years from now. You just focus on enjoying her day, and try not to worry about her bad attitude. The way she's acting isn't fair to you.", "NTA\n\nUltimatum time! Either be a bridesmaid and wear the dress or not be a bridesmaid.", "NTA. Let it be up to her - she can wear the dress with a smile and be a bridesmaid, or wear what she wants and not be a bridesmaid.", "You are not unreasonable to ask her to wear the dress in the color you've chosen for you wedding. I think that your best choice is going to be to tell her that you want her in the wedding, but the dress is the dress is the dress and if she's more unhappy about the color than she wants to be your bridesmaid, then you understand and you will find someone else or simply have four bridesmaids. Tell her you need her decision ASAP, and if she agrees to stay in the wedding, you don't want to hear any more complaints from her or your parents. NTA", "NTA - here's the summary of the only acceptable answer to the bride about bridesmaid dresses \"its great\". Threaten to put her in a time machine to be a bridesmaid in the 80's HA HA! \n\nAnyhow, no OP, you get to pick the dress and your wedding colours. Its fine. She can choose to be a supportive bridesmaid or not, she doesn't get to throw a tantrum and try to manipulate you with ultimatums about your OWN wedding. Dress colour? Nah, you suck that up and wear it. Dress STYLE maybe... maybe she could voice a concern. Like if you were dressing your friends like it was amateur night at the strip club. \n\nMy bestie tried to find the right dress to look good on both myself (5'0\", curly girl red head) and her sister (5'10\" blonde with ultra long straight hair) and put us both in matte chocolate brown strapless dresses.

Is she the golden child??", "INFO\n\nDid no one know the color of the dresses before you bought them? I don't understand how this could have been a surprise. I assume you chose wedding colors and people were aware of them. \n\nEither way, NTA. It's your wedding. She doesn't have to be a bridesmaid.", "NTA - If she\u2019s always this difficult, you shouldn\u2019t budge. On the off chance that your sister is usually pretty chill, and just has an issue with the dress, it would be worth talking to her about it. Maybe give her the option of only wearing the dress during the ceremony, and then after a few photos, let her change into an outfit that she likes. But it\u2019s totally up to you, and wanting her to wear the dress does not make you an AH.", "NTA. Stick to it. All of your other bridesmaids are able to do this and have already paid for their dresses; she wants to be extra, but it's not her day for that. Tell her you understand that she would prefer to pull out of the bridesmaid role rather than wear the dress and that's cool with you. Then make sure you set some broad, but reasonable limits on what she can wear as a guest because she sounds like the type to continue to throw a tantrum and grandstand in other ways (i.e. she'll want to wear a white dress or a Morticia's dress from the Addams Family or something or something styled like it's a Broadway musical costume)", "Info: did you tell her about the Color before she agreed to become a bridesmaid?", "NTA. If she chooses not to attend, then she\u2019s made it clear that her tantrum matters to her more than you.", "NTA. This is your wedding so these decisions are yours. What a selfish brat, tell her that is the dress and she doesn\u2019t want to wear it then she\u2019s not a bridesmaid. Bridesmaids are supposed to support the bride not create problems over nothing.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your wedding and your choice as to what they wear,  she doesn\u2019t need to be a bridesmaid or attend you wedding if she has that much of an issue with it.  Your parents can keep their noses out and opinions to themselves.  It is your wedding and not theirs.  I\u2019m with your fianc\u00e9e on this as she has potential if she attends to ruin your wedding.", "NTA.  I hate pink with a passion.  And I wore it in my cousin's wedding. And it had ruffles! It's one day. It's less than one day. Your sister can wear it or she can bow out.", "NTA- I've been a bridesmaid a few times.   my motto going in to shopping was always it's your day, I'll wear what you decide. Sister needs to suck it up. I hate any shade of pink but if that's my friend picked,  I'd wear it and smile and celebrate their day.", "NTA.  Whenever you accept being a bridesmaid, we all know that there is usually someone in the bridal party that hates the dress or colour.  I had to wear a green medieval style dress for a wedding, for me there was nothing even remotely nice about the dress, but I sucked it up and wore it.  \n\nThis is your wedding, you get to choose the dresses and colour scheme.  Not your sister. If she doesn't like it, especially considering you are paying, and you think she will continue to cause issues then maybe it's for the best that you replace her.", "WNBTA.   Millie and your parents are assholes.  How are *you* acting like a child?  I don't see that at all.  Your expectation that your bridesmaid will wear what you choose is the norm, *especially when you paid for it!*\n\nI agree with your fiance, I would dump her. Actually, make Millie dump herself.  In front of your parents, tell Millie that the dress is what it is, which she knew would be your choice and the same as everyone else's. She can't be in a different color because it will look odd and it's not what you want.  Tell her it's her choice, either wear the dress or don't be a bridesmaid but she has to tell you right now because you are going to try to return the dress and get your money back\n\nIf she and/or your parents balk at this, tell them it's not up for discussion, it's a yes or no question for Millie to answer.", "NTA and call her bluff.   \n\"I'm not going to attend the wedding.\"    \n\"Okay.\"   \nDon't feed into Millie's drama. Make it seem like it's not a big deal.", "INFO: did you know of your sister aversion to pink prior to picking out her dress? Is there a reason she hates the color pink that much?", "Millie is too old to be hanging on to the hatred of pink that half of teenage girls have. She\u2019s a grown up, she can wear the dress or she can attend as a guest in a different one. \n\nNTA", "Info: did she know the color you\u2019d picked?  And did you know how she felt about pink?\n\nBecause if she knew then she should have said something before the dresses where bought and they could still be easily changed if you so wished.\n\nIf you knew about her hatred of pink, then you don\u2019t get to act surprised that she doesn\u2019t want to wear it.\n\nI\u2019m tentatively leaning towards NAH. Because it\u2019s your wedding you can choose the color you want, but I also will not blame anyone for not wanting to spend a whole day feeling uncomfortable in their own skin.", "I know it's your wedding and you have every right to enforce the pink dress but speaking as one big sister to another big sister, please just let her wear the same dress in another color? I promise you that being the bigger person is always good for your karma.\n\nCongratulations on your wedding!!", "Well, if you're willing to deal with the consequences, go ahead and try telling her that.", "NTA\u2014 I\u2019m a huge tomboy myself and hate hate hate wearing dresses. I have panic attacks pretty much every time I try. But I know it\u2019s a me thing, not that anything is wrong with pink dresses. I feel like she\u2019s panicking and unfairly blaming you for her discomfort. I think, \u201cMillie, you can still be a super important part of my day without being a bridesmaid\u2014 if don\u2019t want to wear the dress, you don\u2019t have to be a bridesmaid\u201d should be the fair thing to everyone. You can\u2019t be expected to change your theme and buy all new dresses  to suit her tastes.\n\nBut just as it\u2019s your wedding to have matching bridesmaids in pink, if you want to, you can do whatever you want regarding  what they wear, too. Lots of weddings now have women in suits on the \u201cmen\u2019s side\u201d, or adult flower people or female ushers, or whatever your imagination allows. If she chooses to be rational and not attacking about this and you want to work with her, there are endless possibilities for how she could be included without the pink dress.", "NTA\n\nBut you could ask her for a few alternatives.
