It's actually kind of funny. He's basically trying to be a bully and getting mad that you aren't engaging. If he escalates further I would definitely take it to HR though.", "Your coworker is a child. NTA. Also, it sounds like you\u2019ve got some shit to talk about with HR.", "Wow, man..\ud83e\udd1dgreat \nKeep it up.", "NTA\n\nIt's great that you are able to brush off your coworker's insults and not let them get to you. However, it's important to remember that his behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in the workplace. It's not your responsibility to deal with his childish behavior or to try to make him happy. It's also not fair that he is making inappropriate comments and behaving in a borderline racist way towards you.\r  \n\r  \nYou could consider speaking with HR or your supervisor about the situation, as it's not appropriate for your coworker to be making derogatory comments or behaving in a way that makes you uncomfortable. Alternatively, you could continue to brush off his comments and not let them get to you, but it's important to set boundaries and make it clear that his behavior is not acceptable.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of the pizza incident, it sounds like you were just being kind and offering to share, so you are not the asshole in that situation. Overall, it's important to stand up for yourself and not tolerate unacceptable behavior, but it's also important to do so in a professional manner.", "NTA  he is the AH don't cater to racist dick, let him keep doing larger things maybe he will get fired for it", "NTA For some reason he seems to want to create conflict. I think you are handling it the right way, but I don't know how you can get him to stop. \n\nThis part is concerning \" He's related to the owners so he walks around as if he's better than everyone.\" because you don't know if the owners will overlook anything he does. It's terrible to work in an environment like that.", "NTA\n\nI would be documenting these and take it more \"head on\" frankly.  Depending on your willingness to deal with possible retaliation, I'd send a letter, describing the multiple incidents and indicate you want it to end.  See the reaction.  He'll likely lose his mind and could result in a lawsuit for you if he can't control himself.\n\nNobody should have to deal with this garbage at work.  Someone has to stand up.", "NTA but he will keep escalating until he gets a reaction. Your best bet would be to sit down and try to put dates to specific incidents along with people who would have witnessed them. From there, any time he does something racist, I would log it in your note book with specifics about time/date/witnesses/how and where it was said. Go to HR. It's not childish to protect yourself and individuals who may be more vulnerable than you from this guy.", "NTA. The same lessons for Reddit may apply to life, most importantly : DON'T FEED THE TROLLS!!. I find that most ignorant AHs like him thrive on soliciting emotions from otherwise sane and level people. You ignoring him is diminishing his power, and he doesn't know how to cope with that. Good on you. Keep fighting the good fight kind sir.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust document, recors him, and send the documentation on th HR.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Unless someone is making you actually feel unsafe, what you are doing is absolutely the way to deal with jerks ( even racist ones ).

What if he\u2019s harassing one of the women and this can back up this guy is a bad person?", "NTA.

You\u2019re taking the high road and getting under his skin at the same time. Win-win.", "Yep. OP is taking the high road which is the best choice in most situations, but not for sexual harassment. \n\nNTA OP but please stop letting this guy get away with being a prick.", "Yeah that'swhy it's kind of my fault. I just don't care. It's like a 5 year old making comments at me", "That can be risky if he's related to the owners though.", "It's just hard to care. I'm so hardwired to brush over anything that isn't life threatening. Unless I feel physically threatened. It's like interacting with a child to me.

You don't have to do anything with it now if you don't want to. But this dude is exactly the type of guy whose anger is going to build and build until he explodes and maybe does something truly serious.
