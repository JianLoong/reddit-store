It's actually kind of funny. He's basically trying to be a bully and getting mad that you aren't engaging. If he escalates further I would definitely take it to HR though.", "Your coworker is a child. NTA. Also, it sounds like you\u2019ve got some shit to talk about with HR.", "Wow, man..\ud83e\udd1dgreat \nKeep it up.", "NTA\n\nIt's great that you are able to brush off your coworker's insults and not let them get to you. However, it's important to remember that his behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in the workplace. It's not your responsibility to deal with his childish behavior or to try to make him happy. It's also not fair that he is making inappropriate comments and behaving in a borderline racist way towards you.\r  \n\r  \nYou could consider speaking with HR or your supervisor about the situation, as it's not appropriate for your coworker to be making derogatory comments or behaving in a way that makes you uncomfortable. Alternatively, you could continue to brush off his comments and not let them get to you, but it's important to set boundaries and make it clear that his behavior is not acceptable.\r  \n\r  \nIn terms of the pizza incident, it sounds like you were just being kind and offering to share, so you are not the asshole in that situation. Overall, it's important to stand up for yourself and not tolerate unacceptable behavior, but it's also important to do so in a professional manner.", "NTA  he is the AH don't cater to racist dick, let him keep doing larger things maybe he will get fired for it", "NTA For some reason he seems to want to create conflict. I think you are handling it the right way, but I don't know how you can get him to stop. \n\nThis part is concerning \" He's related to the owners so he walks around as if he's better than everyone.\" because you don't know if the owners will overlook anything he does. It's terrible to work in an environment like that.", "NTA\n\nI would be documenting these and take it more \"head on\" frankly.  Depending on your willingness to deal with possible retaliation, I'd send a letter, describing the multiple incidents and indicate you want it to end.  See the reaction.  He'll likely lose his mind and could result in a lawsuit for you if he can't control himself.\n\nNobody should have to deal with this garbage at work.  Someone has to stand up.", "NTA but he will keep escalating until he gets a reaction. Your best bet would be to sit down and try to put dates to specific incidents along with people who would have witnessed them. From there, any time he does something racist, I would log it in your note book with specifics about time/date/witnesses/how and where it was said. Go to HR. It's not childish to protect yourself and individuals who may be more vulnerable than you from this guy.", "NTA. The same lessons for Reddit may apply to life, most importantly : DON'T FEED THE TROLLS!!. I find that most ignorant AHs like him thrive on soliciting emotions from otherwise sane and level people. You ignoring him is diminishing his power, and he doesn't know how to cope with that. Good on you.

You don't have to do anything with it now if you don't want to.

I know you think you don\u2019t have one, but you may not even know it exists until it gets pressed.\n\nAll that is to say document document document. Specifics of what he said and dates. Write it all down. Hell, look up the laws and see if audio recording is legal there or not. Basically, cover your ass.

He's being intentionally combative, racist and rude!", "POC here: \n\nOP, I know you don't care, but it's ULTRA important as a black man in a corporate setting that you have a legal / papertrail for CYA purposes.\n\nMen like him will only become enraged when they can't force us to conform to their negative stereotype of us, and it WILL escalate. \n\nFor your own safety and security, document everything. Go to HR *after* you've taken your evidence to an independent legal counsel you're retaining. HR is never an ally, and considering his position, you're more likely to be retaliated against and possibly unemployed. \n\nNTA, but watch your back.

Just the date and whatever weird thing he did or said. You don't need to go to HR now if you don't feel like it, but it's obviously getting under his skin and I would expect him to escalate in some way. I'd be a little worried he could go to HR with some weird make up garbage to try to fuck with you. It would be good for you to have some evidence of a pattern of harassment from him if that ends up being the case.", "NTA I was looking for a comment like this. I would truly be careful, he seems the type that may escalate it to a life or death situation because he's not getting his way. I've dealt with arsholes like him before. I ignored him and ignored him until one day we were alone and he basically beat the crap outta me. And it was back when cameras weren't a big thing and he basically got away with it because of who he was and who I was. So please do something to protect yourself. Sounds like you're an amazing person and he's just a major butthead.", "Document document document.   Sorry but these small attacks do build up and you need to be ready to take him down.  Keep ignoring him just push record and move on", "NTA but I personally would report the comment about genitals to HR and document incidents where he is hostile and racist towards you. It may not be a problem for you now and it may never be but if he treats you like this and picks on the women you both work with, it at least leaves a paper trail if he ever does escalate.", "You're not being an A H. If you don't care about his insults, he's not important to you. He can't prove he's better than you because you don't care how he puts you down. NTA, keep doing what you're doing.", "That's the last thing he should do. HR protects the company, not the employee.  OP would  promptly find himself on the unemployment line. There's levels to this.", "NTA. But I think what they meant about The HR thing is to create a paper trail so if he harasses the girls there\u2019s already a history", "HR protects the company *from lawsuits*. You know what causes lawsuits? Ignoring a complaint filed by an employee. Retaliating against an employee for filling a complaint. Does it still happen? Yes. But that doesn't mean that companies aren't sued every day for stuff like this. \n\nAnd here's a secret they don't tell you: the court leans in favor of the employee. That's not a conspiracy theory or something. The employer has a heavier burden of proof than the employee. The employer has the money and the power, and they have to work their \ud83c\udf51 off to prove definitively that they weren't discriminatory. *And that's the way it should be.*", "By reporting it, you are adding evidence for a pattern of behavior, which could be very helpful in support of your female coworkers. Sadly, your complaint would add weight to any complaints filed by the women in your company by virtue of you being a man.\n\nEdited to add\u2014I do think what you\u2019re currently doing is probably the best way to deal with this guy, and you\u2019re definitely NTA."]}
