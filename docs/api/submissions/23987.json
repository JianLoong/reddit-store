After a few times, she gets very defensive and we end up in a big argument.\n\nExamples:\n\n1. She turns on the AC, doesn't close the bathroom window and leaves the bathroom door open. When I pointed it out, she said it's closed even though it's visibly ajar by at least 6\". She then says I must have opened it when I went to use the bathroom... (I didn't). She then says the door must have hit something and didn't close... which doesn't explain why she didn't just close it after moving whatever was in the way. She was in the hallway, I told her to look at it herself and she just walks away.\n\n2. She often leaves the porch light on, even after being reminded to turn it off when she comes in. Everytime I turn it off at night before going to sleep, I just tell her she forgot. She then says she did and I'm lying. Every. Single. Time. Last night she just flat out said the house is haunted.\n\n3. She snore loud enough I can't sleep. When I tell her in the morning, she denies she snores. Then she says I snore but she doesn't complain. I'm like how would you know, you are asleep all night while I am awake and you are still asleep when I wake up from my 3 hours of sleep to go to work. I videoed her snoring one time to show her I wasn't lying and she refused to watch it. That one ended up in a huge fight. I got tired of it and slept on the couch just to get some sleep. That worked well until my schedule changed so I work later than her and she would stomp around loudly on our wooden floors and open every drawer or door multiple times and banging on the kitchen cabinets so that I would wake up. I resorted to using foam earplugs.\n\n4. She'll leave the front door unlocked or just straight up open and go to sleep. We live in a decent neighborhood but I still wouldn't leave it unsecured. I tell her she forgot to lock up and she will insist she did or I am lying just to give her shit. She will also throw it back and say why can't you do it? I told her I would but I am not always in the living room and if she is going to bed, just lock it up as she is the only one who loves leaving the front door open for ventilation. (She has a thing for fresh air)\n\nMe bringing these things up is just for her to be more mindful or in the case of her snoring, I suggested going to a doctor or getting nose strips, which she ignored.\n\nI am trying not to be the asshole but she thinks I am just giving her shit or that I should just do whatever she forgot, and not say anything because it's not a big deal.\n\nWell, one time I fell asleep on the couch early. She was up. Then she goes to bed, leaving the whole front door open and unlocked... until I woke up the next day to go to work. I was livid! She just said she didn't notice when she went to sleep... ugh.\n\nAITA or should I just suck it up without saying a word?", "created_utc": 1691298571, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jgyg8/aita_for_pointing_out_things_my_so_consistently/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are you willing to deal with it for the remainder of your years without complaint or are you just wasting too much energy on it between dealing with fixing the issues as well as dealing with the arguments and need to just move on from the situation because either way she's not changing.", "NTA, what exactly dies she bring to the table that you feel comfortable dating someone who's comfortable lying straight to your face about the most minor of incidents?\n\nSounds like she's really used to lying to you.", "NTA. The worst part of her behavior isn\u2019t her forgetfulness \u2026. It\u2019s the fact she straight up lies about it and tries to gaslight you by saying you did all these things. That\u2019s completely unacceptable and would drive me bonkers. I personally, could not live with someone like that. She\u2019s not only careless, but a jerk.", "NTA. She needs to see a doctor or therapist. Something is mentally up with her.", "INFO: in all seriousness, why do you stay with her? Does she have ADD? Her behavior would annoy me to the point of breaking up with her. She doesn\u2019t care she keeps you awake with her snoring. She doesn\u2019t care about your safety. She lies. It\u2019s such odd behavior.", "I swear this sounds like something I couldn write about my soon to be ex. I don't think your the AH. I hope you have concern for her forgetting to do important things (like close and lock the front door). Seems she has memory issues or something. Perhaps talk to your primary care doctor and see how you can help her.", "NTA\n\nSomething is going on with this person. She seems way too forgetful and cavalier when it comes to commonplace safety issues such as closing and locking the front door. Anyone should know to close and lock the front door. Not doing so could potentially put you in real danger. Also, deflecting and refusing to admit to snoring seems troubling and is a form of gaslighting. It\u2019s not a positive behavior trait. She may not be able to completely fix her snoring problem, but refusing to try or even admit ( in the face of evidence) that she snores at all is not right. Snoring effects your sleep as well and she seems to not care about that at all. It seems like she is very narcissistic. I\u2019m not sure was the solution to these problems is, but things need to change for your own good.", "NTA! But something is off, it seems she\u2019s either gaslighting you, or has some weird self defense mechanism.\n\nI would advise trying to just automate some of this stuff. Automating porch lights is easy. Maybe, attach a spring on the door so it closes automatically and a stopper for the few times you actually need the door to be open. Same thing for the front door get a simple smart lock that you can turn from your phone.\n\n\nThese aren\u2019t expensive upgrades and you should be able to set everything up by yourself. \n\nCan\u2019t help you with the snoring mate. Maybe go get checked out for a deviated septum, or if you have direct air on your bodies while sleeping.", "NTA. I initially thought this was going to be an ADHD issue based on the title, but snoring has nothing to do with forgetfulness, and her response to you telling her she snores is to gaslight you. Gaslighting is decidedly not a symptom of ADHD.", "NTA, though with a few caveats. I'm willing to bet you aren't as gentle with your comments to her as you sound in your post, hell, I wouldn't be either if this had been going on for a long time. You don't mention how long this has been going on, but I agree with several of the other commenters that if you want to continue to live with this person you need to figure out, between the two of you, how to mitigate some of these issues. It shouldn't be all on you to suck up and deal with it, but it's not realistic to believe she'll be able to fix everything over night if it truly is forgetfulness. Ask her to set reminders on her phone, put a little note by her bedside, instead of accusing her of forgetting, ask how you may both work towards a solution in the future. You may learn that having the door open all night doesn't bother her and that's why she doesn't remember to check it. But from the tone of your post, at the way you're going now, it seems like you two aren't suited to living together, and if you don't frame the conversation gently but in all seriousness, then you may both may find the most suitable solution to be an exit from this partnership. \n\n Also, you can't expect a person to magically stop snoring because you're upset, that's not how that works.", "Is her memory ok? Is she generally healthy? Maybe she is confused and not lying?", "You two don't seem to be compatible living together. She does so many things that you find annoying. Should she change to suit you, or are you just in the wrong relationship? Or are you in the right relationship but need to live separately and not together?", "Instead of pointing fingers and cycles of fights, you can remove as many of the issues as possible.  Get timer for the porch light.  Similarly you can get the automatic door locks.  \n\nShe probably does just forget/not notice.  Just being verbal doesn\u2019t help so try other options.  Ask her what you can do to make things more comfortable while addressing your concerns. Also be clear why it\u2019s a concern but not in the moment.  If it\u2019s only coming up reactivity she\u2019ll be on defense.  Be proactive, see if you can get her to agree to a few counseling sessions on how to better communicate.\n\nSnores are often just facts of life", "I find your situation confusing.  Part of me feels like you are nagging too much, especially concerning the minor things that you have the power to just take care of as you'd like, thus skipping all the drama.  The other part, the denial when confronted, is concerning IF it is new behavior.  When someone is experiencing mental issues, especially a decline, they will often become defensive/combative when confronted.  What you construe as lying may be something else entirely. Definitely encourage a medical checkup and also some joint counseling to see how to better solve these things that are surely annoying you both.", "NTA. But you really need to look at this in a bigger way. She sounds like a horror to live with, and it doesn't sound like she will change. Can you keep going like this for the rest of your life?", "Not sure about AH l, but have you asked her about her mental health? If she is struggling, it would be hard to deal with what will appear as something minor, even if to you it feels important.", "Either you have a ghost or a horrible girlfriend.   \nMy BF cannot switch off a light to save his life but at least he tries some times and doesn\u2019t give me shit when I mention it.

I think she knowlingly does these things. She  doesn't want a lecture from you, so she lies.", "Nta. She's not going to change. Either suck it up or move on. Tbh I couldn't live with someone like that", "Nta.  This is annoying as hell even for me as reader.  Consider take a break and see from there.  If its meant to be, it will find ways.  But for now,  you need break", "She doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s actually doing this intentionally and more , to me , that she\u2019s being defensive when her behaviour is questioned. The defensive attitude could be from worry she\u2019s having about her memory lapses .", "My dad and my brother are like this. They're both sloppy/lazy and will get defensive/make up ridiculous excuses just to deflect blame. It's honestly tiring to even talk to them about any issues because they simply won't admit that they did something wrong and they should do better next time. \n\nI think it has to do with their upbringing. My brother was largely raised by my grandmother, and my dad was too (obviously). My grandmother was a pushover and believed every excuse and lie they would tell her, so it really became a convenient way for them to get away with doing dumb stuff.", "She is gaslighting you, plain and simple. These are \u201cminor\u201d lies, but she refuses to take responsibility and you can\u2019t trust her. This is manipulative and abusive behavior.
