We also always knew life with our stepmom. But we still knew our mom was our mom and stepmom was stepmom. I have never considered my stepmom equal to my mom in my life. My mom comes first. If I want motherly advice I go to her. It's my mom I want when I'm upset and stuff. My stepmom is fine but she's just not my mom.\n\nOne thing about my stepmom that really makes me awkward around her is she always wanted to be the mom a daughter and she has no girls. She apparently latched onto me from the time she and dad got serious and my grandparents and aunts and uncles said she used to try and dress us in matching stuff. She has this weird fixation with me. She's not upset that my brother considers her second best but it bothers her that I don't consider my mom. She tells me every year just before Mother's Day that she would love for me to call her on that day while I'm with mom. She will also ask if I want to do some mother/daughter mother's day event with her every year and I always say no. Then I get to see her face fall and she'll start to cry.\n\nI don't have that kind of love for her and I'm not even sure I actually do love her. She makes me so uncomfortable with her obsession with me being a girl for her.\n\nMy mom joined me for a mom and daughter photography trip my photography club hosted. We were gone for an entire day and had a great time. My stepmom saw photos of us on social media and she cried at me asking why I invited mom when it wasn't even Mother's Day so I could have invited/asked her instead and we could have done something cool like that. She told me how much she longs to get the experience of being a mom to a daughter.\n\nI told my stepmom she needs to accept she will never be the mom to a girl and I will always be my mom's daughter and not hers. She told me she has been in my life since I was a literal toddler and should see them both as my mom, when I spend the same amount of time with both.

NTA", "The story fell apart in the last 2 paragraphs. Laid it on a little thick there. 4/10", "Stepmom here..Bonus Mom actually..of 4 daughters!!\n\nI don't understand why you don't love her. I don't understand why you think she's \"obsessed\" with you. The examples you gave (IMO) do not justify your lack of affection for her or saying she's obsessive. It seems more like you have completely rejected her and refused to form a real stepmother/stepdaughter bond with her, which is all she really wants. Why do you think her treating you like you were her daughter when you were little is grounds for you to say that \"it was because of this obsession\" that she would try to dress you in matching outfits? That was just her being excited to have a little girl in her life and nothing to do with obsession..\n\nTo me, the behaviors you listed are examples of a woman trying to be a good stepmom and treat you as if you were her own. Which is what a good step-parent should do. Not to mention this is her first time ever being a stepmom and she doesn't really know what to do or not do. She's been *learning* how to be a good stepmom for 15yrs. She's been trying to *love* you for 15yrs. She's been trying to find a way to get you to love her back for ***15yrs***. She's not asking to replace your mother, she's asking to be a *second* mother to you. She's asking for you to do things with her that you would normally do with your mother ***also***, she's not saying 'pick me not her'..\n\nIt's not uncommon for a woman to wish they had a daughter, especially a woman with all boys. And when said woman marries into a family with a daughter, yeah she's going to be excited, she's going to want to do girl things, mom/daughter things. There's *nothing* wrong with that. I think you would be more hurt and disturbed by her if she treated you like crap or like you didn't exist.\n\nI don't see this as being forceful, and it wouldn't feel that way for you if you would at least try to see it through her eyes.\n\nYou should feel blessed to have a stepmom who loves you, not all stepchildren are so lucky.", "INFO - What exactly is the reason you constantly reject her?

You already have a mom.", "As someone who has experienced this from the other side this is obviously weird and unhealthy for *you*\n\nbut also has anyone asked how her *sons* feel about this?\n\nA parent with a clear (and obsessive) preference for one gender makes their biological kids who are not that gender feel as if they've let them down just by existing.\n\nThis woman needs a wake-up call.", "NTA, you already have your mom and no one has the right to make you feel guilty.", "Yeah, I really think if she'd had an actual daughter she wouldn't have cared all that much about bonding with me. When the dream of having an actual daughter was gone decided I would be the sole focus of that dream.", "So you say not respecting boundaries is ok.", "She's only that into me. My brother is just as much her stepkid but he's not a girl so she has never made the same effort with him, is not upset by his lack of care for her.

Like, how much does that mess with their head? Do they think their love and affection for their mom means nothing compared to a step siblings? \n\nNTA at all, OP. You might do well to remind your step mom of her living breathing biological kids before she tried to guilt trip you once again", "kinda asshole? she did raise you at least 50% of the time since you were a baby and obviously has a connection and cares. why would you reject her and be an asshole when all you gotta do is make a call on mothers day to literally the woman who raised you as much as your biological mom? this sub is full of stories that are literally the opposite where the step parent is a huge uncaring asshole. appreciate what you have. these people aren't gonna be in your life forever and when they are gone you're gonna regret being an asshole to them", "NTA. I'm a mother and a stepmom. I've always respected my sons' mother's place in their lives. Since they live with my husband and I full time, they see me more.

After my husband had a stroke, they also text me all of their normal day-to-day stuff too.  My husband and I have always helped our sons get their mom a gift for her birthday and Mother's Day. \n\nMy opinion is that if your stepmother had not pushed so hard and just made herself available, your bond would be stronger.\n\nAll that being said. She's a human and your stepmother. When her emotions quiet down, tell her what you appreciate about her. Let her know that you are grateful for her presence. Then gently restate what you said, keeping in mind that it's better to be kind. You aren't betraying your mother by enjoying your stepmom's company. Let her know that her guilt trips feel like manipulation and makes you want to spend even less time with her. The more she respects your bond with your mother, the more you'll appreciate her space in your life. \n\nYou're young. Unless there is something truly awful about her, I want you to consider that the world will not have dozens of people seeking to dote on you and care for you. Our hearts have the ability to love and expand. I didn't think I could possibly love my second bio son as much as my first... then he was born, and my heart grew.

It sounds like she is taking it way too far by pressuring you to do things you're not comfortable with, and that is pushing you further away. I remember being 15 and the last thing I wanted to do was \"family stuff,\" and especially forced family stuff at that age.

That being said, ur feelings are ur own and the way she is forcing this mother-daughter situation isn't the best way to handle things.

She wants to do mother/daughter activities with you, why aren\u2019t you open to that? Why do you just seem to flat out hate her? \nShe\u2019s asking you to think of her as someone who has been there for you, your entire life, that loves you like a parent does. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to set boundaries and say something along the lines as I won\u2019t call you, mom, or I prefer to spend Mother\u2019s Day with my biological mother. But I think you\u2019re actually rather entitled and privileged, and the way that you view this relationship with a woman who never had to love you, never had to like you, never had a treat you as her own. There are so many people who probably wish that they are stepparent loved and looked at them as one of their own and you just disregard it and think of it as an obsession instead of one way love. \n\nI\u2019m not a stepparent, but I have a stepmother he\u2019s been in my life since I was 10 years old and I\u2019m 27 now.

Yet for some reason you have chosen to not only love one more than the other but actively make your stepmom aware you love her less. Which sounds so cruel to me.\n\nTake her side into consideration.

And by the time I finished high school, I started wishing her happy Mother\u2019s Day even before she had any of her own. Because I felt that she loved me the way a mother does - biological or not. \n\nAs my brother (not hers) got older it was harder for her to bond with him and plan special days so my dad would do something fun with him.

You can't go do your nails with your sons/stepsons. You don't usually talk about boys with them. You don't talk about girl stuff like make up, or other girl related things. \n\nLike, it's normal for a mom of boys to want a girl and do girl stuff, it's a dream everyone has, and it's not even like she's asking such strange things of you. She knows you since you were little, I'm sure she's done enough to say she also raised you, and you're acting like she's some kind of evil figure who's just here to oppress you or something. Doing something with her wouldn't cost you ANYTHING. You're just here complaining about her showing interest in you instead of also being a bit comprehensive of her feelings. Telling her she'll never be a girl's mom and that she needs to get over it was just a shitty thing, really awful, that's why for me YTA. \n\nYou're old enough to know that if you don't like how she's backing and what she's \"demanding\" of you, you can always talk to your father or mother.\n\nA personal experience, when I was younger, I momentarily found myself in a position similar to yours. I was at a family friend's house and the woman there was a mom of only boys, so when I came out of the pool and changed myself in dry clothes, she asked me if she could dry my hair for me (long girly hair) because she could never do that before to her boys and probably never would to anyone, a bit strange but I let her do it. It didn't cost me anything, and in the meanwhile, I made her happy, probably realizing a dream she always had. All of this just to say that doing something with her once in a while won't kill you, it will make you happy and will make her happy too. Because if you hate her so much that doing small things together harms you so much, you should just not even go to your father's house anymore, but I think that's really too much after the situation you've depicted in the post.", "I love this comment so much.

If someone has been continuously pushing your boundaries and trying to force a relationship for years on end, I think it's very understandable that there's going to be resentment for that. \n\n2. Yes. She did. Stepmom got upset when OP took her mom on the photography trip instead of her. That was not related to mothers day. \n\n3. I disagree. There are examples of shitty behavior like is said in my first point. And mothers day has nothing to do with respect. OP does not see stepmom as her mother, why would she do things with her on mothers day? Stepmom has five other kids she can spend that day with. \n\nYour issue seems to be that OP is being \"too mean\" to her stepmom and you think we can't judge because we don't know the entire backstory. I would argue that we don't need to know it. You said that stepmom is not owed a relationship, but you seem to think she is owed some of the things that would come with it. I'm not saying stepmom is evil for trying to form a bond. I'm staying she sucks for trying to force a bond for over a decade and can't accept that her stepdaughter doesn't see her as a mother figure and that's FINE. Just because stepmom doesn't have a daughter to bond with doesn't mean OP is obligated to fill that spot.", "I don\u2019t think you know what hate is. \n\nIt seems you think the only reason a person wouldn\u2019t reciprocate love is because of hate, but like, no? \n\nOP certainly dislikes her stepmother, but that\u2019s because her stepmother is disregarding her bodily autonomy. The stepmother\u2019s love clearly isn\u2019t about OP. It\u2019s about herself, and OP isn\u2019t required to love anybody. That\u2019s not how love works.", "People really need to learn to accept that everything is not going to go their way. This girl has decided that she is not interested in a relationship with the step mother and that is perfectly fine. People are allowed to have firm boundaries and other people should respect those. What people should not do is keep pushing in hopes someone will just give in. That\u2019s disrespectful.", "This is textbook definition of Obsession. \n\n1\n: a persistent disturbing preoccupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling\nbroadly : compelling motivation\nan obsession with profits\nhas an obsession with gambling\n\nOP has stated that she does not feel comfortable w/ step mom\u2019s attention. That\u2019s persistent and it\u2019s how the SM feels. Therefore. Obsession. \n\nSo. Tell me how that \u201cis healthy\u201d thinking?", "You sound like one of those guys that thinks they have an \"aha got you\" moment but really just don't know how to read", ">According to OP she can\u2019t. But let\u2019s say the woman can\u2019t, and she is mourning the fact that she RAISED OP and loved her and tried everything she could (it appears) to show OP that love only to be slammed by her and told \u201cHAHA YOU can\u2019t have a daughter. Get over it\u201d\n\nDid she try everything she could to show her love? Stepmom has made everything about her own needs and feelings. She is obsessed with the idea of having a daughter, and despite it clearly impacting OP negatively, has continued to try to force it on her and manipulate her into feeling bad so she can get her way. That is not good stepmother/mother behaviour. True love would be accepting that you are the stepmom and being ok with that, because that's clearly what's in the best interests of the child. It's perfectly normal for a child in a blended family to want to differentiate between their bio parents and stepparents. \n\n\n>My question is, WHY did OP\u2019s stepmother raise her and her \u201cwonderful\u201d bio mom didn\u2019t? Ever think of that? Doesn\u2019t sound like OP should have been discounting a \ud83d\udcaf Mom for a part time mom. Judges don\u2019t like to take custody from Bio moms unless they have reason to believe it\u2019s healthier\n\nWhere does OPs post say that stepmom raised her and bio mom didnt? OP said they have split custody. OP clearly spends time with her mom and is close with her. There's no reason to believe that mom isn't raising her too. \n\nAnd where does it say that a judge took custody from bio mom?", "She's 15 not 12, the judge will listen to her because the woman is not going to change.", "Do you know all the judges? There'll be at least one who sees this as toxic and unhealthy as it is. It's one thing force your step child to have a relationship with you, it's entirely different to demand you replace her actual mother.", "It wouldn't be enough to sever his parental rights, but a family court judge also isn't going to force a teenage girl to visit her dad. I've seen it over and over in my work.", "Ah so she\u2019s surrounded by guys all the time lmao \n\nWell I know I\u2019m getting lots of downvotes but again - I don\u2019t think she has bad intent. She\u2019s spent every other week with you for the past 14ish yrs? She assumed your relationship is different than it is. You don\u2019t feel the same. \n\nAgain, it\u2019s really all in your hands. Doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s going anywhere so like I said before how you want this relationship to look for presumably the rest of your life is up to you. \n\nBut also you cannot be frustrated, If that means that from that point forward, she lives by your boundary and her behaviors change - including ones you may take for granted.\n\nI do think you\u2019d benefit from seeing a therapist to help sort out some internalized conflicts you may be having about accepting the fact this is what your family looks like (and always has) and any guilt you may subconsciously feel for allowing space for your stepmom while you bio mom is still present, which is what it sounds like is occurring.", "I hear ya, I understand your POV but I also know I\u2019m reading this through the lens of a 15 year old kid. A kid who probably isn\u2019t giving every single detail necessary to understand such a complicated relationship. \n\nA kid who doesn\u2019t recognize or have ability to look at this situation in any different light except the way she feels or see  what the step mom has been or done for her. This isn\u2019t a simple solution or NTA/YTA at all. It\u2019s not egregious behavior on the stepmom at all. \n\nEveryone\u2019s acting like this stepmom just waltzed in to OPs like within the past few years. She literally helped raise her - every other week for the past 14ish years. It\u2019s complicated and OP can benefit from both individual and group family therapy 100%", "Yes I believe everyone should be treated with kindness as a fundamental right thats not a view i have specifically for this relationship.\n\nI dont understand why my opinion is so divisive here. The point I\u2019m making is this is one side of a story so lets be rational and try to understand the whole picture instead of pulling out our torches and pitchforks and validating someone confessing to treating her Step Mother this terribly. \n\nPeople often warp the truth and make negative things seem not as bad and good things look better. \n\nConsidering OP\u2019s own confessions to her behaviour im scared to have seen what actually happened.", "Oh I know how to read, I am just not fooled like many of you are. The fact is, her Daddy didn\u2019t stay with her Mommy. He found a NEW Mommy when she was a little girl. NEW Mommy obviously loved her and treated her like her own very precious daughter. BIO Mommy only had visitation and yet OP decided she was a hero and the epitome of Mommy. OP didn\u2019t want step Mommy in the picture even though Daddy OBVIOUSLY did and kept her in his life and OPS life 100% longer than Bio Mommy was. This bothered OP and she decided that step Mommy was somehow \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cobsessed\u201d even though step Mommy was in her life from a VERY young age. But nonetheless, OP reached out to a bunch of strangers on Reddit, asking \u201cpermission\u201d to be an ASSHOLE to the very woman who was apparently nothing but kind and loving to her. \n\nYOU are trying to excuse the fact that you were giving her validation for being a TOTAL asshole to a woman that was kind and loving to her, simply because she didn\u2019t share DNA with her. \n\nI wonder, if OP had told this story and shared that bio mommy lost custody of her for reasons of abuse or addiction, had you felt differently? I mean, OP glossed over the fact that step mommy raised her from toddlerhood full time and how much she ACTUALLY LOVED bio mommy more and decided step mommy was \u201cweird and obsessed \u201c because she loved her like her own.\n\nWEIRD! And a THOUSAND alarms tell me that OP needs some serious counseling or she should come clean on her story", "have you gone through custody court? the judge is not going to remove custody from the father over this.", "The woman is doing nothing wrong, except maybe trying too hard and pushing a relationship.", "Sometimes, you can still be an asshole with no ill will. It\u2019s like saying \u201cI will help you, no matter what,\u201d especially if you\u2019re unable to help in the situations. Your eagerness to do good just becomes a burden for other people.\n\nAnd OP can ABSOLUTELY be frustrated, especially because her stepmother ISN\u2019T living by her boundaries and changing her behavior. Sometimes, losing something you like (or take for granted) is worth it because you also lose some painful or uncomfortable.\n\nAnd while I do agree that OP would benefit from Therapy (I think everyone would benefit from a good therapist, tbh), your reasoning assumes that OP is wrong for not wanting to pursue the relationship. That the only reason they are having problems is because they haven\u2019t accepted reality and feel guilty. She can accept this is what her family looks like and still not like it. She can not want to make space for a stepmom without it having to do with her mother. And that\u2019s doesn\u2019t make her damaged or wrong.", "Sure, we aren't getting everything, but the simple fact that this expectation doesn't exist for any other child and OP states that if she had any issues and he mom wasn't available, she would go to her grandma or aunts first and step-mom isn't really on the list tells me no real bond w/ OP has ever been established. \n\nI think it is a huge assumption to think that just because step-mom was around and did [insert generic female parental task], that means she bonded with OP or developed in trust w/ her and OP owes her.\n\nKids can know and see when a person loves them for who they are and who doesn't. They know the difference between \"doing suff for the kids\" and nurturing. I think you are really dismissing OP's own lived understanding of the relationship dynamic b/c she is \"a kid\" who doesn't appreciate the sacrifices of this step-mom. 15 yr olds are brats, but they know what a bond feels like. They know genuine love. They know when a relationship is \"off\" - they can feel it.", "I think you're exaggerating how terrible OPs behavior is. And there's a difference between being kind and just giving in to pressure. Stepmom is not asking for kindness, she's asking, or rather demanding, to be treated like OPs mother. OP never indicated she is disrespectful or mean to her stepmom in everyday life, she just is honest about the fact she doesn't see her as a mom. And she refuses to do things that would imply she does. That's probably the kinder option because it doesn't allow for false hope. If OP starts doing these things stepmom is just going to get it in her head that they have a mother daughter bond and be hurt all over when OP tells her again that she doesn't. And again, ops responses are coming after years of this treatment. She isn't being listened to,stepmom just keeps asking in hopes she'll change her mind which over time gets very annoying. Stepmom disregards OPs feelings, why should OP tiptoe around hers?", "So you're so good at reading that you even read things that were never written, good to know, cause nowhere in the post, or in the comments, say that mom only has visitations, in fact it says that op spends equal amounts of time with dad/stepmom ad she does with mom sooooo ya no te ardas bro", "True bur OP is old enough where a judge wouldn't force her to spend time with her dad necessarily. She can choose not to go to dad's.", "I dunno, my mom made us meet with a judge when they divorced because we said we wanted to live with my dad. We met with the judge, told him what we wanted and he said ok. I think we were 15 and 12. My mom was a teacher, neither parent had addiction issues, both worked. It was just assumed back then that moms got the kids and house in a divorce, but we got what we wanted after telling the judge.", "Different ballgame in a kids teens. They start getting more of a choice.", "actually, she's 15 and in most states, she can choose who she lives with, I know a few she has to wait till she is 16, not sure about overseas laws.", "Maybe not totally, but OP is old enough to have her opinion taken into account that it could easily be changed to every other weekend with Dad at most. And if she doesn't want to do that much, even if that's the official agreement, she's old enough that no one is going to force her. \n\nMy dad never tried to enforce the custody agreement to my knowledge (I consider it the one decent thing he did through the divorce), but I assume that it wouldn't have gone over well if he went to court to try to force his 17yo and 15yo daughters, one of whom had a license and a car, to spend weekends at his house.", "a relationship that she should have therapy on because she wants a daughter that badly.  Getting upset because the girl's photo club did a photoshoot with the moms, was beyond pissy.  What if had been with dad's and if mom was remarried and stepdad pulled this, would you say the same thing?", "that is also true", "I definitely did not have the same experience but I'm glad that that worked out for you when you were younger.", "So mom lost custody? I'm confused.", "idk when I was 16 I was not allowed to choose. I was allowed to forgo going for things like work and sports but that was it really."]}
