My older brother was 2 at the time and he's now 17. Our dad remarried just over a year after the divorce and they created a blended family. Dad had us, our stepmom had 2 boys who were pretty much the same age as my brother and me and they have three more boys together. \n\nMy parents split custody of my brother and me and we always knew life with both parents. We also always knew life with our stepmom. But we still knew our mom was our mom and stepmom was stepmom. I have never considered my stepmom equal to my mom in my life. My mom comes first. If I want motherly advice I go to her. It's my mom I want when I'm upset and stuff. My stepmom is fine but she's just not my mom.\n\nOne thing about my stepmom that really makes me awkward around her is she always wanted to be the mom a daughter and she has no girls. She apparently latched onto me from the time she and dad got serious and my grandparents and aunts and uncles said she used to try and dress us in matching stuff. She has this weird fixation with me. She's not upset that my brother considers her second best but it bothers her that I don't consider my mom. She tells me every year just before Mother's Day that she would love for me to call her on that day while I'm with mom. She will also ask if I want to do some mother/daughter mother's day event with her every year and I always say no. Then I get to see her face fall and she'll start to cry.\n\nI don't have that kind of love for her and I'm not even sure I actually do love her. She makes me so uncomfortable with her obsession with me being a girl for her.\n\nMy mom joined me for a mom and daughter photography trip my photography club hosted. We were gone for an entire day and had a great time. My stepmom saw photos of us on social media and she cried at me asking why I invited mom when it wasn't even Mother's Day so I could have invited/asked her instead and we could have done something cool like that. She told me how much she longs to get the experience of being a mom to a daughter.\n\nI told my stepmom she needs to accept she will never be the mom to a girl and I will always be my mom's daughter and not hers. She told me she has been in my life since I was a literal toddler and should see them both as my mom, when I spend the same amount of time with both. She said it's disgusting that I would reject her over and over again and then tear her down like that when she could easily be my second mom.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699636063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17s8lwh/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_she_needs_to_accept/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It literally becomes the reason you dislike them, when you used to. Tell her this. \n\nLook- I'm sorry I hurt your feelings, but there comes a point where you need to consider MY feelings in all of this, which you have never done. You have always made a point of telling me why I should want something different than what I want. Do you not get that you cannot order or force people how to feel?  And that someone who does try to do that to you makes you uncomfortable to the point of dislike.  That is where we are now. I do actually dislike you because you are trying to force me to be and feel something I'm not. \n\nWe can be friends. We were friends. But now you're this creepy person who keeps trying to push out my mom. Stop it. Again, I didn't want to hurt your feelings but you don't take \"no\" for an answer. You don't let my words work. You ignore what I say to you. You act like I'm some doll you can dress up and play daughter with and completely objectify me in this way.\n\nThat is not who I am or who I want to be and we will never have any sort of cordial or comfortable relationship as long as you are attempting to control how I feel.", "NTA, you have established and told her your boundaries,  she is not respecting you.

I think her crying and trying to guilt-trip you is very manipulative and not fair. It\u2019s not your fault that she has had only boys. She needs to accept the fact that you don\u2019t feel her closer than your mom.", "NTA. Stepmom here. We're not owed anything!\nYou have your mom, your stepmother needs to understand that she will never be able to replace her.\n\nI'd die before I'd ask my stepson to put me above his mother. He's mine and I love him with all my heart, but I also know that he has a mom. And I'd never expect to take her place.\n\nBy the way, she doesn't want to be your second mom. She wants to be your mom and that's impossible. The sooner she realises that, the better. She's not owed the experience of being a mom to a daughter.", "This is extremely creepy, can\u2019t imagine how you feel. NTA", "You used the correct word for your stepmoms behavior, obsessed.

NTA", "The story fell apart in the last 2 paragraphs. Laid it on a little thick there. 4/10", "Stepmom here..Bonus Mom actually..of 4 daughters!!\n\nI don't understand why you don't love her. I don't understand why you think she's \"obsessed\" with you. The examples you gave (IMO) do not justify your lack of affection for her or saying she's obsessive. It seems more like you have completely rejected her and refused to form a real stepmother/stepdaughter bond with her, which is all she really wants. Why do you think her treating you like you were her daughter when you were little is grounds for you to say that \"it was because of this obsession\" that she would try to dress you in matching outfits? That was just her being excited to have a little girl in her life and nothing to do with obsession..\n\nTo me, the behaviors you listed are examples of a woman trying to be a good stepmom and treat you as if you were her own. Which is what a good step-parent should do. Not to mention this is her first time ever being a stepmom and she doesn't really know what to do or not do. She's been *learning* how to be a good stepmom for 15yrs. She's been trying to *love* you for 15yrs. She's been trying to find a way to get you to love her back for ***15yrs***. She's not asking to replace your mother, she's asking to be a *second* mother to you. She's asking for you to do things with her that you would normally do with your mother ***also***, she's not saying 'pick me not her'..\n\nIt's not uncommon for a woman to wish they had a daughter, especially a woman with all boys. And when said woman marries into a family with a daughter, yeah she's going to be excited, she's going to want to do girl things, mom/daughter things. There's *nothing* wrong with that. I think you would be more hurt and disturbed by her if she treated you like crap or like you didn't exist.\n\nI don't see this as being forceful, and it wouldn't feel that way for you if you would at least try to see it through her eyes.\n\nYou should feel blessed to have a stepmom who loves you, not all stepchildren are so lucky.", "INFO - What exactly is the reason you constantly reject her?  It seems like reading this that she took on two extra kids while marrying your dad and tried to love you like her own.", "YTA and NTA because divorces and stepfamilies are super messy.", "ooof, the MIL makes me cringe.   \nNTA, you can choose how you want to relate to your step mom - if your interactions are making you uncomfortable, then you don't have to do what she wants.  \n\n\nTo be nice, you could try and find a way to reenforce the actual relationship you want to have with her and try to set a boundary.", "Nta kids who take the opposite approach to you are aholes", "NTA.  She's not your mom.  You already have a mom.", "As someone who has experienced this from the other side this is obviously weird and unhealthy for *you*\n\nbut also has anyone asked how her *sons* feel about this?\n\nA parent with a clear (and obsessive) preference for one gender makes their biological kids who are not that gender feel as if they've let them down just by existing.\n\nThis woman needs a wake-up call.", "NTA, you already have your mom and no one has the right to make you feel guilty.", "Yeah, I really think if she'd had an actual daughter she wouldn't have cared all that much about bonding with me. When the dream of having an actual daughter was gone decided I would be the sole focus of that dream.", "So you say not respecting boundaries is ok.", "She's only that into me. My brother is just as much her stepkid but he's not a girl so she has never made the same effort with him, is not upset by his lack of care for her. Even her wanting to be treated the same as my mom is awkward to me when she has this idea of all these girly things we'll do together. I would rather she was indifferent than all of this. It's uncomfortable and I have never liked it.", "Her love as a step mom sounds conditional (based solely on the fact OP is a GIRL).....that's NOT love. And just bc your situation/blended family worked out doesn't mean that's OP situation (so please stop protecting).\n\nShe can respect her SM, but that DOESNT ENTITLE SM to her love or being called her mom/bonus mom/etc.", "It doesn't even seem like OP is \"rejecting\" stepmom. But she's not inviting her to mom events because she has a mom. It's not like her own mom was no longer in the picture or that stepmother completely raised her.", "She makes me uncomfortable and she only tries to do that for me, not for my brother. It's like he doesn't exist. I only get that effort because I'm a girl.", "With any relationship it\u2019s built by two people and a mutual understanding and desire for the connection.  If one side is expecting something different than what the other is willing to share, it becomes problematic.  Her stepmom is forcing a relationship that she wants on OP.  OP has already set her boundaries and the fact that her stepmom kept pushing is disrespectful.  Stepmom is an entitled asshole.", "But so did the dad.? \nIt was a pretty quick wedding after a divorce, but that's just my two scents. \n\nThe difference is, though. Stepmom launched herself into a mom role because OP is a girl. Instead of just stepmom. And wants to go to mom daughter stuff. \nInstead of just being a trusted adult and respecting, she has a mother. \n\nShe could have been more relaxed and invited her to \"girl day\" \nWhile giving the boys attention, too. Instead of crying when OP is doing something with her mom. That comes off as manipulating.\nIt's off-putting when someone is so fixated on you and tries to force a bond. \nMost would become defensive if someone tried to take their mom's place constantly. I mean, texting someone on mothers Day? \nShe didn't let things be natural.", "That's not OP's fault.....she's NTA, but the one forcing a relationship (SM) IS", "How does that make OP an AH? Not like the divorce and remarriage are her fault.", "And what does your dad do?", "no one said anything about boundaries here.. Nowhere in her story specified that she had set any kind of boundaries either.", "She doesn't treat your brother that way because she has nothing but boys.. She treats you that way because she has nothing but boys.. Why is the thought of loving another woman as if they were a mother to you so awkward?

Weird seeing all those posts above of ppl telling u that u are not in the wrong, have some kindness.(Edit after seeing ur age): Be more kind in life, don't hate ppl or anything unless they have earned it and have some courtesy for someone who has not done u any harm and just asking for a very minor thing in return.\n\nLook at it this way... what do u have to lose if u spend a night with her?\n\nalso don't listen to random ppl on the internet about these things, talk to a family member, most of these ppl (or me) wont be able to understand ur situation.", "Your ignorance is showing.
