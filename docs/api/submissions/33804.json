Due to various factors, David spent a majority of his early years with my parents. By the time I was 10 and David was 12, he moved in. David and my dad look nearly identical and people always assumed that was his son. My parents always said he was their first kid, they loved him like a son, etc.\n\nI always felt a bit weird about this. David is a nice guy, but he\u2019s not my brother. I never understood why it was my parents\u2019 job to pick up the slack of my grandparents\u2019. It caused a few disagreements in my youth that always boiled down to \u201cDavid has nothing, you have everything, be nice\u201d. I hated that i essentially went from an only child to a younger sister without being asked. I never looked at David as a brother but obviously due to our small age gap, I never saw him as an uncle. To me, he\u2019s just family. We get along well.\n\nDavid is now married with a daughter, Aria. My parents are \u201cgrandma and grandpa\u201d to her. It does make me feel some sort of way that they\u2019ve christened her as their first grandbaby, but I\u2019ve accepted I can\u2019t control how they feel and relate themselves to David. So long as when my husband and I have kids they\u2019re the same to them (and I know they will be), that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe real issue is that David, his wife and my parents have tried making me \u201cAunt Tabitha\u201d. I don\u2019t like it. Aria isn\u2019t my niece. I tried to just refer to myself as my first name with her but the hint wasn\u2019t going through. As Aria is too little to speak (8 months), I planned to let it go for now.\n\nYesterday, we were at my parents\u2019 for Christmas. Aria was being fussed over, as usual. When it came time for David and his wife to help her unwrap the gift my husband and I got her, David told Aria \u201cthis is from Auntie Tabitha and Uncle Mike!\u201d Without thinking I said \u201c just Tabitha and Mike\u201d. David gave me an odd look but went back to unwrapping.\n\nLater on, privately, David asked if I was okay. I said yes, why? He said I got weird during gifts. I said not weird, just factual. I\u2019m not Aria\u2019s aunt. He was still confused. I said I\u2019m not his sister. This seemed to hurt his feelings but he said okay, apologized and said he\u2019d never say it again.\n\nMy mom pulled me aside later and said I was cruel to David. She said he considered me his sister. I simply said I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m not that baby\u2019s aunt. My mom gave me a disgusted look. She and my dad barely spoke to me the rest of the night, though David and his wife were polite.\n\nMy husband feels there were better ways of going about it.

Other adults don\u2019t get to decide to endow you with family relationship titles that you don\u2019t want.

Nobody should have to be uncomfortable with the names/titles being used, whether it\u2019s the person being addressed or the person addressing them (this goes for children and adults).\n\nThree points I\u2019ll try not to belabor:\n1. I was forced to call people I actively disliked who treated me with disdain at best by affectionate titles (aunt/uncle) as a child and it damaged my relationships with several of my \u201csafe\u201d adults when they pressed the issue. It didn\u2019t stop until one lost patience with the group mind and told them to \u201cleave the kid the hell alone\u201d. I let the children in my life decide what and if they want to address me.\n2. One of my parents decided to actively campaign for their new spouse have a grandparent title, despite me asking them to leave it up to my child to decide when they began speaking (at the time, child was under two and we lived several hours away by plane). The repeated instances of cards being signed by \u201cGrand_a Theirname) led to a falling out with that parent. Call me petty if you will, but it was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back after a lifetime of disregard and gaslighting (textbook definition, the actual pathological behavior). Let people use title they feel about you, it shouldn\u2019t be about the \u201cadult\u2019s\u201d ego.\n3. The littles of one sibling call me by a special nickname which I love. Another sibling has stated vehemently that their children will never call me by that name. I choose to enjoy it from those who use it and I\u2019ve come up with palatable (to everyone) alternatives for any littles that sprout from that branch. It\u2019s not a big deal unless you make it a big deal. \n\nThe theme that unites these? You can\u2019t fake feelings and expecting it just gets someone\u2019s feelings hurt, at best. It sounds like OP doesn\u2019t feel negatively about the person of David so much as the parents forcing the \u201cbrother\u201d label. If she is undiagnosed ND, this could be a factor in why she can\u2019t \u201cjust go with it\u201d.\n\nJust my $0.02, take it with a grain of salt \ud83e\uddc2.", "YTA - kids don\u2019t ever decide if they are getting a sibling, parents decide how many kids they want to raise.

The issue is you don\u2019t want your parents to see David as your brother, you don\u2019t want them to love him. You don\u2019t want your parents to consider themselves grandparents to his child.

And from what you've described from David's reaction, it's hurt him. I can only imagine that being left by his parents (whatever the cause) might lead to him feeling unsure about his family relations, and whether they'll also leave him. So I can see how, if you've never talked about this with him, you suddenly (from his POV) refusing to claim him could intensely hurt. \n\nMaybe focus on what type of relationship you WANT to have with David? You say you don't feel like his sister, but still acknowledge him as family -- maybe focus on that positive aspect. Just from a third-party perspective, I'd say it sounds like he'd really appreciate being told that you DO want him in your life, and I think that might also help YOU. Now that you're both full adults, you can make a conscious decision to invite David and his family into your life -- and you also have the ability to define what that relationship looks like. \n\n  \nI'd really recommend getting together WITHOUT other family members present to discuss. It doesn't have to be a big deal, it can just be brunch. It sounds like you still value him and his new family, but parts of your history together are getting in the way of your relationships being a positive experience. If you share some of that burden with him, it might actually help you both.

You even admit that you had a plan for yourself (let it go for now) that you failed to follow through on. Which is a sort of self betrayal. Either your plan was insufficient or your follow through was interrupted by reactivity. Or both. \n\nI\u2019m sure you have valid concerns and hurt.

Due to various factors, David spent a majority of his early years with my parents. By the time I was 10 and David was 12, he moved in. David and my dad look nearly identical and people always assumed that was his son. My parents always said he was their first kid, they loved him like a son, etc.\n\nI always felt a bit weird about this. David is a nice guy, but he\u2019s not my brother. I never understood why it was my parents\u2019 job to pick up the slack of my grandparents\u2019. It caused a few disagreements in my youth that always boiled down to \u201cDavid has nothing, you have everything, be nice\u201d. I hated that i essentially went from an only child to a younger sister without being asked. I never looked at David as a brother but obviously due to our small age gap, I never saw him as an uncle. To me, he\u2019s just family. We get along well.\n\nDavid is now married with a daughter, Aria. My parents are \u201cgrandma and grandpa\u201d to her. It does make me feel some sort of way that they\u2019ve christened her as their first grandbaby, but I\u2019ve accepted I can\u2019t control how they feel and relate themselves to David. So long as when my husband and I have kids they\u2019re the same to them (and I know they will be), that\u2019s fine.\n\nThe real issue is that David, his wife and my parents have tried making me \u201cAunt Tabitha\u201d. I don\u2019t like it. Aria isn\u2019t my niece. I tried to just refer to myself as my first name with her but the hint wasn\u2019t going through. As Aria is too little to speak (8 months), I planned to let it go for now.\n\nYesterday, we were at my parents\u2019 for Christmas. Aria was being fussed over, as usual. When it came time for David and his wife to help her unwrap the gift my husband and I got her, David told Aria \u201cthis is from Auntie Tabitha and Uncle Mike!\u201d Without thinking I said \u201c just Tabitha and Mike\u201d. David gave me an odd look but went back to unwrapping.\n\nLater on, privately, David asked if I was okay. I said yes, why? He said I got weird during gifts. I said not weird, just factual. I\u2019m not Aria\u2019s aunt. He was still confused. I said I\u2019m not his sister. This seemed to hurt his feelings but he said okay, apologized and said he\u2019d never say it again.\n\nMy mom pulled me aside later and said I was cruel to David. She said he considered me his sister. I simply said I\u2019m not, and I\u2019m not that baby\u2019s aunt. My mom gave me a disgusted look. She and my dad barely spoke to me the rest of the night, though David and his wife were polite.\n\nMy husband feels there were better ways of going about it.

Frankly they have some nerve getting upset with you because you don\u2019t share their feelings about David when they appear to have never asked you how you felt about it.

I have 1 niece, she\u2019s the only person who gets to call me aunt.", "I hate to tell you, but most of us older siblings were \"never asked\" if we wanted younger siblings. Is it weird that you got an older sibling instead of a younger one? Probably.  Does it matter? No.  I'm kinda with your parents,  you're a freaking adult who was raised most of your life with another person. You both called the same people, mom and dad,  and based on the limited information, he never mistreated you, and neither did your parents.  You're kinda a major asshole on this who needs to get over your childhood jealousy.  I literally went in this like no your nta, but after reading in like yup yta. Most oldest siblings have to get over new baby jealousy, and you just never did.  If he was your biological brother, you'd be the asshole. The fact that you're still holding onto this makes you the asshole.  My name is Janiece,  my niece calls me Necie, sometimes Aunt Necie, but most of the time, it's Necie. Going by a nickname is a good substitute for aunt if it bothers you bad enough.  She calls my husband Bear, and my son calls my brother Bug. They both call my mom Amy instead of Maeme (her grandmother name) because my dad always referred to as her name.  Lol But think about this,  when your mom and dad are dead and gone, you can either be alone which is incredibly sad, or you can have a relationship with the other person who knows exactly what it was like to be raised by your parents and loved by your parents,  and they are the only person who will know what it's like miss your parents exactly the way you do.  Losing my dad in 2021 made me and my brother closer, because we are the only two people who knows what it's like to be loved by our dad and how much of a loss it is that he's not here. One day, you'll talk to your \"uncle\" and say, \"Remember when dad did this,\"  and you'll cry and laugh and be happy you have somebody else there that can share in those memories.  The only people you have that kind of a relationship with is a sibling.", "YTA - but I am not really blaming you if that makes sense?  Sure you didnt ask to not be an only child and I am sure he wanted his parents raising him to not feel unwanted. Seems like unresolved child issues. However, the aunt thing is technically correct but an AH move. My son calls many ppl that are not TECHNICALLY aunt/uncle his aunt/uncle. Its a title you give to ppl that mean something to you. Just a steange hill to die on since he was raised with you and it would make sense for his kids to see you as an aunt figure.\n\nI am sorry your feelings were not validated/heard as a kid - I guess figure out what kind of relationship you want (if you want one) and go from there.", "YTA", "I kind of understand where these feelings come from. My dad remarried when I was ~12 and I have two step brothers. I'm not close to them at all. The oldest one went to college shortly after and my dad moved to another state shortly after the marriage. They are not my brothers. I do not see them as siblings.\n\nMy step brother's daughters are still my nieces. I'm their aunt. I get feeling the weird twinge at your parents calling them their grandchildren. \"Not technically\"\n\nIt doesn't hurt me to be their aunt. Those words are not solely about familial ties, but about the functional role you play. It is very common in other cultures to refer to even non-related people as aunt and uncle. \n\nI understand you were hurt as a kid, but you need to try and move on from it. Right now, you're just hurting yourself and your family", "YTA.  But if it makes you feel better to hold a grudge over your parents being awesome and loving someone else in the family like a son, then own it, and keep being hateful.  It\u2019s all about you in the end, right?", "It sounds like OP isn't Chinese, however, so it's not a vague term. It normally means 'my parent's sister' and OP does not want that designation.", "I think the difference is tho, he genuinely sees her parents as his parents too, and they consider him their son. it's not a lie to save their reputation or something, so it's not about insecurity, it's just that he's their son in every way that matters. he respected OP's wishes and sounds like he's always been nice to her, he just misunderstood their relationship. \n\nShe could've easily said she doesn't want to be called aunt and that would've been the end of it. it'd get the point across without being unnecessarily cruel. NTA implies that he's the AH, and he hasn't done anything wrong. they have the same parents so he assumed she'd be called aunt, that's not AH that's just a misunderstanding.", ">I also think OPs parents did a bad job. They didn't listen to their daughter, didn't give the reassurance that was needed at the time & even now are riding roughshod over OPs clearly stated views & opinions. They told her to be kind because David had nothing. That patently wasn't true - he had family to look after him & his presence diverted some of the love, care & protection that OP   \n>  \n>should  \n>  \n> have had from   \n>  \n>HER  \n>  \n> parents (not David's fault), and caused those parents to undermine OPs feelings.\n\nThis is precisely what is wrong with reddit. It promotes a me me ME mindset. Her parents had to take David in becasue of a family emergency. Her \"opinion\" to let David become an orphan wasn't a reasonable one, and it does not sound as if she was abused or neglected. Just resented David getting any love and attention. She frankly sounds spoiled and entitled.\n\nAlso, you're full of it when you say fosters and adoptive families look at birth order as super important and to \"never put in older kids.\" Older kids are harder to adopt and your ignorance is a reason why.", "Why would it be confusing?", "She's still an asshole.", "But being called Aunt will remind OP every time that her parents do not care about her feelings at all. Doesn't matter whether you feel they are valid feelings or not. She is hearing loud and clear, \" We are all family the way we want to be, you are just there, get over it\". \n\nDavid is just collateral damage here, let's be honest. Op's beef is mainly with her parents, and David is also an adult who can understand and get over it. The baby is a baby and will grow up and accept whatever she is presented with, whether aunt or cousin.", "My parents though rather flawed and maybe not the most well equipped to parent loved me deeply and raised me to know that love can be shared. The more you love, the more your capacity to love grows. It\u2019s beautiful in that way.", "I might be more sympathetic if this was from someone < 18 but at the big grown age of 32 this is behavior is unacceptable. There is no indication that OP was neglected at the expense of her brother and I cannot believe how many people here are agreeing that this behavior is normal or acceptable.", "Just because it is normal in some cultures/families to call close family friends aunt/uncle doesn't mean that she has to be okay with that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think it's absolutely great that her parents stepped up for her father's younger brother and kind of adopted him to be their son.\n\nBut he is still officially her uncle and she sees him like that and not as her older brother. And they have to accept that. \n\nShe could have handled the situation better but I think they never ever bothered to ask her about how she feels that her uncle stays with them and gets treated as if he was her older brother when in fact he is not.\n\nI go with NTA here but I suggest that op should have an honest conversation with her uncle about that situation.", "NTA. The parents made the choice to take him in. She was 10-12 years old when he came to live in their home. If she does not see him as a brother, she should not be forced to to so. It's the same principal than blended family. You don't have to see your step sister or step brother as a sister or brother.", "It\u2019s the same in filipino culture! How many aunts I have that aren\u2019t my biological aunts lol. I have my kid call my close friends as aunts and uncles if they\u2019re comfortable with it.", "Agreed. If OP's parents were bringing David up, then he had to be treated like a son rather than a brother. It couldn't be an equal sibling relationship because OP's dad was in the parent role and had a responsibility to him as a parent. \n\nOP, NTA for not wanting to be called aunt, that's your choice. But you sound very jealous of David, who, by the sounds of it, did nothing to upset you. Perhaps your parents didn't handle your feelings particularly well when he came into your family, but that's not his fault, and all these years later isn't it time you worked out your feelings about this and dealt with them? Therapy sounds like it might be useful for you.", "How many people do you know that have adopted kids? I mean it has to be a lot if you are making a bold statement like \"I don't know anyone who ASKS their kids before having or adopting another child\"\n\nI only know a few and only one couple asked their kids (12 and 10 at the time) what they thought about it. But I have read plenty of stories on AITA and almost all that involve kids at OP's age talk to them before adopting a family member.", ">I don\u2019t know anyone who ASKS their kids before having it adopting another child. \n\nHaving kids is not usually discussed, however adopting kids is 100% discussed with the kids in the family. \n\nMy parents asked my brother and I if we were ok with the idea of us adopting a younger sibling. My parents took into consideration the emotional effects it has on their kids before making a step to bring in someone who is not a blood relative and treat them as they are, that concept is very confusing for younger kids so discussing it is actually the healthy way to deal with adoption. My brother and I have both said that because our feelings were taken into consideration before the adoption and it felt like a \u201cfamily\u201d decision and not one that was forced upon us. I don\u2019t know if we would have had any animosity to our sister if this didn\u2019t happen but I don\u2019t think the transition would have been nearly as smooth if this didn\u2019t happen. \n\nMoral of the story, if you already have kids that are of walking/talking age, involve them in the discussion of adopting before you adopt, it will help the kids relationships long term.", "They also didn\u2019t take into account how their own child would feel. And frankly, it\u2019s strange to refer to your brothers child as your granddaughter. He is the fathers BROTHER not SON, that is a fact regardless of how they feel.\n\nI also know I\u2019ll get downvoted for my opinion in the last part but it is strange to me personally so I can understand how op feels.
