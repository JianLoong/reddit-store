It's obviously missing context. It has holes like Swiss cheese!  I've had parents like you say things like this to their friends, principals, etc.  I feel I can confidently say **I know** there is more to the story.\n\nAnyways, you love your kid. She was embarrassed. Model good behavior and don't be smart alec to another adult professional and use that degrading rhetorical questions approach parents unfortunately use with their kids:\n\n* **Did you go to medical school?**\n* **Were you born yesterday? Are you stupid?**\n\nNot much of a difference there, OP. Adult or child versions of rhetorical questions. I recommend you take that method of attack out. There is no need for it. Model good behavior for your daughter. Teach her how to be assertive and that teachers, like everyone else, are just humans and cannot diagnose her.\n\n**Future Advice:** *This post makes me believe you most likely trash talk your child's teachers in front of them.*\n\nOne more thing: Try not to trash talk your kid's teachers while at home. It affects how they act in the classroom. It gives kids a chip on their shoulder and it makes it even harder to teach them. I am not saying your daughter is like this, but it is important to model respect.", "There's a lot of context missing here but anyone who talks about \"putting \\[others\\] in their place\" is an AH.

That might be a sign or something...", "ESH\n\nFrankly, this post reads a bit like an entry from a competitive asshole competition. Nobody comes off this well.\n\nSo let's start at the top.\n\n1. Kids asking questions about things they aren't sure of is a good thing. If the teacher had just finished explaining this, and your kid wasn't paying attention, then being called out for not paying attention is fair enough. But teachers really shouldn't be humiliating kids in class, so this is at least one tentative asshole point for the teacher.\n2. Being autistic is neither an \"accusation\", nor an insult. It's just a thing. You wouldn't say that the teacher \"accused\" your child of being blonde when they think they're a brunette, would you? So this gets you an asshole point.\n3. If your teacher does suspect your child of having autism, or ADHD, or some other condition that would impact their learning and would benefit from special treatment and extra resources, then it is absolutely their job to bring this to your attention (no, your teacher can't diagnose autism, but they can say that your child demonstrates several behaviors consistent with autism, and can recommend that you have her evaluated.) But the way to do this is in private, between the teacher and you, and not in a class full of children. So that's another asshole point for the teacher.\n4. You deliberately chose to ridicule the teacher, because you wanted to reduce her to tears. You seem proud of this fact. Asshole point for you.\n5. The principal doesn't actually do anything in this story. It seems like a principal who just sits there and lets you reduce one of his teachers to tears without doing anything has earned at least a partial asshole point for being a crappy boss.", "Sure a gastroenterologist that went to med school is certainly more qualified to detect signs of learning disorders/neurodivergencies than a professional that has taken psychology courses/may have specialised in Special Ed/has experiences working with children", "You don\u2019t provide enough information about what happened in the classroom for anyone here to provide feedback on that part of the situation. Your yelling and aggressiveness in the meeting with the principal and teacher does make YTA. You sound like an angry and scared person who gets off on trying to bully other people (or just tell Reddit you did it), rather than a concerned parent advocating for your kid. If you really behaved this way (part of me thinks most of this is hyperbole to try and feel smart and powerful via a tall tale on Reddit) do you think your behavior will help your kid in that classroom and in that school? Even if the teacher is some over the top villain, your behavior is going to make the principal decide you\u2019re the one with issues, not the teacher. If the reality of the story is that the teacher has genuine observations that lead her to believe you child should be evaluated for autism, a learning disorder, etc your puerile behavior has set back testing and help for your kid.\n\nEven if everything went down in the classroom exactly as you describe (without any real details aside from the teacher\u2019s villainy), your poor behavior may well impact your child\u2019s experience in that school. There are ways to be clear with teachers and admins that their behavior was unacceptable without being abusive. There are ways to advocate for your child that put you and the teaching staff on the same team to give your daughter the best education and support possible. End of the day, that principal and teacher thought you were a fool with anger management issues and probably felt bad for your daughter. I hope they are true professionals and ignore your boorish behavior and try to listen to the concerns you were trying to raise and address those.\n\nBottom line\u2014if you act like this in the real world you might feel that you got your point across with all your yelling and attempts to humiliate but every adult you encounter sees a small human being trying to make themselves look powerful through aggression. Knock it off and put your energy into parenting.", "YTA. You want the teacher tarred and feathered, and then fired. Another teacher leaves. Shortage continues. Congratulations, you made the teacher cry. Feel better?", "ESH\n\nThe principal seemed to be handling it and was on your side? Why attack him? The teach I get but not the principal?", "NTA/YTA. A teacher that bullies a child deserves what they get, especially one that uses things like autism as a way to mock a child. \n\nHowever, I think the principal did not deserve to be a target of your scorn. I didn't see anything where the principal had done anything wrong. You could have come out of this with an ally, now I think you are going to be lucky if the principal even deals with you civilly.", "YTA. It is a teacher's job to look out for possible issues that may impact learning. Autism, and ADHD could impact learning. I agree the teacher cannot make a diagnosis, but she was sharing her professional opinion. \n\nFurthermore, it is important to teach your child that just because they does not know something when called upon, doesn't mean they should feel humiliated. Let them know school is for learning. This is not the first - nor the last! - time they will be confronted publicly with information they do not know.\n\nYou have the opportunity to reflect and do some *real* advocacy for your child here. Not rage-fueled screaming at educators who are trying to help, but instead, perhaps consider following up with testing your child for autism. Early diagnosis can make life much easier for everyone.", "Yta. How are you going to take their jobs? Are you on the school board? Are you the superintendent? Don't make threats if you can't back them up. It makes your look as a loud buffoon.", "ESH. The principal was probably going to do something about it, before you shot yourself in the foot and attacked him for no reason.", "Info: what did the teacher say?\n\nAutism isn't an insult or an accusation. It's a neutral descriptor of how some brains work. Teachers are in fact trained to notice developmental differences, so you should have your kid evaluated so she doesn't end up miserable. Read Unmasking Autism, it'll help", "Over reaction.", "NTA/YTA, the teacher deserved it but the principal didn\u2019t do anything wrong", "NTA good for you that is completely unacceptable and you should be going after job regardless. I would also like an update after all of this plays out", "Based off the info provided, I do think you could've done things differently in a way that would better benefit your child .  Expressing your anger and disappointment in such an aggressive style may have shot yourself in the foot. \n\nThe teacher was absolutely wrong to ridicule your child. This deserves reprimand and corrective action. The person who should do that, though, is the Principal. When you do it, you simply lay the groundwork for an environment of conscious or subconscious retribution towards your child, all because the teacher feels now feels negatively toward you. I am concerned that you prioritizing your emotional release in the moment and shouting at the teacher may have made things worse for your child.\n\nNext, I don't think the teacher is wrong to have concerns about mental health and autism - a teacher who is around children day in and day out can notice if something feels off - and they can and should discuss their concerns with the parents, in private, and recommend the child get seen by a doctor. You probably didn't go to medical school either, so your opinion on the matter is  just as likely to be inaccurate. Arguably, the teacher might even have a better sense of these things since they are around a larger sample size of children than you.  Furthermore, if your daughter did in fact have autism or OCD or anxiety or something that was affecting their performance at school, I'm sure that you as a parent would want to know since you would move mountains to get her help if she needed it. \n\nFinally, why get angry at the principal? They have done nothing wrong. And furthermore, using the principal as an emotional punching bag only serves to potentially unite the teacher and principal against you given your temper, and ignore the underlying issue which is that your daughter shouldn't get bullied at school by her teacher.\n\nI think if you could redo that parent-teach-principal meeting, it may have helped your daughter more if you had calmly told the teacher something along the lines of \"it breaks my heart that my child was reduced to tears based on how you treated her. It disappoints me that you or any teacher would think bullying her was ok. Your concerns about her mental health may be valid, and of course I will discuss her health with her doctor. If her doctor is similarly concerned, however, don't you think your bullying may actually be the reason for the mental health issues and even if not, it would certainly make things worse?\"  And to the principal: \"What corrective steps will be taken from here?\" If the steps are not satisfactory, ask who you can appeal to, since you don't want a bully to be teaching your daughter.", "NTA. It\u2019s your job as a parent to stand up for your kids. This teacher was actually PROUD of their shitty actions and behavior. I would have done the same if not more in that situation. If the teacher showed remorse it might be different.\n\nToward the principal.. maybe a bit AH-ish. I don\u2019t think they deserved the anger.", "Sometimes parents take their kid's side too quickly in these situations, which is why there are so many bubble wrapped kids out there.  \n\nThis is not one of those situations!  You are definitely not the AH!  You did the right thing by arranging a meeting with the principal.  He/she needed to hear the teacher admitting your daughter had told the truth.  She was definitely in the wrong.  Even before she started giving her opinion in the form of a diagnosis.\n\nSome parents intervene when it is not necessary and their kids need to deal with consequences of their actions.  This is not what you did.  Your daughter needed her parents to intervene and bring the teacher's actions to the attention of the principal.\n\nYour daughter is lucky to have parents who will listen to her and react appropriately when necessary!  You are lucky to have a daughter who knows her parents will listen and back her up when necessary.", "NTA for your dealing with the teacher. I\u2019m on the fence about the principal. Hopefully they were going to do the right thing but you have to wonder if the teacher has this confidence hiw common this behaviour is and hasn\u2019t been addressed.", "NTA. I usually side with teachers but this was ridiculous. I don\u2019t think you were in the wrong. But I think you could have allowed the principle some time to actually do something first, before going off on them.", "NTA. Thank you for doing that.  That teacher needed a reality check.", "Nta.My teacher called me stupid when I raised my hand to ask a simple question. I was 10 yrs old.  I fought hard not to cry as I packed up to leave the classroom.  She demanded to know just where I was going. I couldn't tell her because I was so near to bursting into tears. She started going towards me and I ran out the door and burst into tears once I got to the office.  I was crying so hard that the sweet front office lady called my dad and told him to come pick me up immediately. \n    He had to comfort  me and wait till I calmed down before I told him what happened.  That was the first time I ever saw that much rage overcome him. He told me to go wait for him in the car immediately.  \nI obeyed rather than pester him with questions. His rage scared the crap out of me.  \n    I still don't know what he said or did. But a meeting was set up for my parents, my teacher, a friend of mom's, the principal another person and me. At first she tried to deny it and said that I was lying. Till the person said he had interviewed several kids and all confirmed that she had screamed at me and called me stupid. \nSo she tried to defend herself and she got put on probation and was told this was her last chance. That there wouldn't be a 4th chance.  \nShe did other things to me to make my life hell after that and was fired.\nSnapping at the principal was an asshole move. Standing up for kid not an asshole move. Its ok for to tell you her concerns but its not ok to your kid and in front of the whole class.
