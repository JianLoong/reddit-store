If someone does not view you as an equal, your words literally mean less to them; that's not buying in to the power structure, that's just how things work. She could cut contact, but that's a pretty extreme solution if this is the major issue they're having. She can't literally *make* him not touch the food.", "My dad grew up in MX, he would never act like this and never treated my mom or I (his only daughter) like this. Asshole crosses all cultures and nationalities.", "I thought as much, but while I know poverty, I didn't know enough about Mexican culture to say it.", "My dad, mum and their families grew up poor, living hand to mouth. They always ensure everybody else has enough to eat as they know what it is to go without. Eating everything in sight, even when it clearly belongs to someone else is simply an asshole thing to do.\nYou are NTA.", "NTA - except for you excusing his behaviour as growing up poor.         \nThere is no excuse for his behaviour so stop excusing it.      \nYour Dad is simply an AH who doesn\u2019t give a crap about others", "YTA a little bit for allowing this behaviour from your dad to continue. He\u2019s not a child. He\u2019s a grown man. If he can\u2019t respect basic rules of food etiquette and respect your husband then he\u2019s an asshole. And if you or your mum turn a blind eye or condone this behaviour by telling your husband to buy extra food or hide his food in his own house then YTA.", "ESH here except your husband.\n\nYour Dad for some trying bullshit behaviour and everyone around him for not helping/forcing him to improve.\n\nI'm with your husband about the dinner party if he came into my house an just helped himself to food without asking, especially just cutting into a cake before it was served for desert, he would be asked to leave.\n\nIts about respect, and he doesn't have it for other peoples belongings.", "Your dad\u2019s a fucking asshole. He knows better.", "NTA. It sounds like you are sharing a kitchen with your family. If so, they do make locked boxes that go in the fridge, or you could buy a small fridge for your room and lock a chain around it.", "NTA... your dad is being rude and needs to be called out on it.\nIf he is living with you, there needs to be a separate fridge", "Like many with food insecurity, my friend hoards food. She would never act like the father here because that would possibly mean there was no food left for the next meal. Hers is more apt to be the result of food insecurity than what is happening here. He is just being an ass because he can.", "So he's just an asshole?", "NTA but my dad was a \u2018macho\u2019 man. As in he work himself to the bone, worked in a metal company and kept working while having chemo to make sure his family had food on the table; and suffered from extreme poverty, like he was living on the streets when he was young, like having to get food out of the garbage can poor. The man wouldn\u2019t eat, and until he made sure no one else wanted more. \n\nThis feels like he\u2019s just trying to prove that he\u2019s better than everybody. Like he\u2019s trying to erase the fact that his past happened by having more than everybody else now he needs help.", "My dad grew up on government rations and has issues about food too. He can\u2019t stand wasting food and will eat until he\u2019s sick. When he goes food shopping, he buys food like it\u2019ll be the apocalypse tomorrow; there\u2019s two full freezers and two full fridges at home for a family of four. What he doesn\u2019t do is eat other people\u2019s food. I get being protective of his own food and wanting to eat when other people are eating if he grew up poor, but stealing other people\u2019s food after being repeatedly told not to is just being an AH. If he grew up poor he should know how much people value their food.", "Even if it\u2019s a trauma response he can\u2019t pay that forward onto the next generation. He needs to Go watch encanto and buy his own snaks", "It shouldn't be jokingly. Part of the issue is that is seems the rest of your family is enabling your father.", "I'll give you that my Mexican dad didn't grow up anywhere near poverty (by his own admission,  his father who had grown up incredibly poor and survived the Holocaust,  spoiled his only living child rotten), but my cousins FIL grew-up dirt poor in Jalisco and he is incredibly gracious and a conssumate host. None of the Mexican (as in still living in MX and regardless of age) men in my family treat their wives or daughters like this. Definitely more machismo in MX culture,  but I usually see it manifested as wanted the best for taking pride in caring for their family.  If anything ,my Mexican female cousins were treated like princesses by their dads. Yeah, it is a different flavor orf misogyny,  but their dads would happily walk over glass for their daughters (and sons) to get the best of everything.  And, most Mexicans are very hospitable to guests. You can't just pop-over to a neighbor or acquaintance's house to drop something off, without leaving without a stomach full of coffee and pan dulce. 99% of Mexicans,  regardless of their race or economic status,  will absolutely not be rude as a host or guest - especially about food. They want to see their family and friends stuffed to the gills.", "Anthropologically speaking, teasing or emasculating is the socially acceptable way to bring down a macho ego in many cultures. I wonder how much that has to do with evolution-- the idea of teasing or emasculating being a warning/precursor to social outcast status", "Why does pan dulce sound amazing?", "Because it is! It just means \"sweet bread\", but it encompasses a wide array of sweets! One of the best memories of my childhood was a bakery run by Mennonites. Fantastic traditional pan dulce, German pastries,  and Mennonite cheese and butter! I think it is/was near Augascaliente", "So, clearly, I need to find and try some.", "Any urban US area/area with a decent Latin American population will have some somewhere. My favorite pan dulce place has some of the best cannolis, I've had outside of Italy. Around Easter many sell capirotada and if you want a Mexican beverage,  fuck horchata, try champurrado. If you live anywhere with decent Puerto Rican population,  I suggest coquito (kind of like eggnog, but with rum and coconut milk). Also Mexican eggnog-like \"rompopo\" (get the brand with the nun on the bottle).", "NTA.   \nThere's no way this man doesn't know what he's doing. He's acting like a entitled child.   \nHonestly, I'd make a batch of Carolina Reaper muffins and let him learn a lesson about stuffing random food in his mouth.", "NTA. You should put gross things in your food. Nothing harmful, but something like filling a croissant with wasabi/horseradish. Scotch bonnet peppers. Cupcakes with pickles in the middle. Hide some intensely colored food dye in something (maybe hot pink since he\u2019s so \u201cmacho.\u201d Anything he doesn\u2019t like specifically? Bet you he\u2019ll think twice next time he\u2019s going to eat something that isn\u2019t his.", "If I was your husband I would lick the hell out of the next item, take a pic of me doing so, and just ask how that tasted. Probably solve the issue\u2026", "NTA - how often do your dad buy extra? i will be petty and eat his food.", "NTA. Growing up in poverty doesn't mean you can't have manners or education. Your father is an AH", "My family is like this too (we\u2019re also Mexican and my grandparents are from Mexico ) . My dad didn\u2019t go as far as take out but we did have to ask everyone if we were making food if anyone else wanted some. I literally begged for a mini fridge but also got told no \ud83d\ude43", "I\u2019m sorry, but it seems like you\u2019re trying to make excuses for your dad\u2019s disgustingly awful behavior. And you\u2019re enabling your dad\u2019s behavior by doing so. your dad\u2019s behavior isn\u2019t from being impoverished, even extreme poverty, and/or working for what he has. My father also grew up as 1 of 8 kids in an extremely poor family-neither my father or any of my uncles would behave in such a manner. What your dad is doing is domineering and exerting control, nothing less. its Also extremely disrespectful", "I think that\u2019s the only way that you\u2019ll get through to him. You shouldn\u2019t cater to his pouting either. Unless you\u2019re dependent on living with them, then you should start to firmly uphold boundaries. Don\u2019t invite him to your house for the party. Don\u2019t visit him at his house in the future.", "A couple examples I've heard are by setting boundaries. It could be that OP says 'dad I really hate when you eat food I brought myself or marked. If you do that again we'll be leaving' and then following through on the boundary they set when the dad eats their food. And then doing that again, starting the boundary and following through if they are broken. Or it could be not inviting him to events with food because he can't control himself around it. It's a hard battle to fight, but it sounds important to OP so I feel like it'd be worth it.", "Your dad is a hard worker who came from nothing and I respect that. He's also a grown man, husband and father so he needs to learn to deal with his issues and not visit them on others. NAH for now but stop enabling his behavior and call him out on it.", "This. Her dad is just an asshole.", "No lie, if it was me and my father was stealing from my plate, he\u2019d pull his hand back with a fork stuck in it. This one legitimately upset me. \n\nI was immensely calmed when I properly read your user name."]}
