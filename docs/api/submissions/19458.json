{"id": 19458, "submission_id": "14643z1", "title": "AITA for kicking my sister out, even though she was \"just trying to help\"?", "selftext": "My wife and I just welcomed our first and last baby in to this world 2 weeks ago. It was a complicated delivery and she ended up needing a hysterectomy. Our daughter is perfect however and we are very overjoyed that she is still with us. She's doing great. My wife, not so much. She has postpartum depression and she cries a lot. There's been a complete lack of sleep. She's up basically all night panicking and making sure our daughter is breathing and she won't let anyone take her out of her sight. \n\nMy sister (46f), who lives with us and could never have kids of her own, has been basically hounding us to \"just let her help\" by taking the baby for a few hours so we can sleep. As I said, my wife will not let the baby out of her sight. She immediately panics. Even if she showers she has to have the baby in there (I hold her in the bathroom while my wife showers). I am more than willing to make all accomodations I need to in order for my wife to heal mentally. My sister on the other hand keeps pushing it and saying that I am enabling my wife's behavior and \"making her worse\" by not basically forcing her to get a break and get some sleep. \n\nWell, I went to the store yesterday and when I got back, my wife was in a complete meltdown. Apparently she had fallen asleep and when she woke up, the baby wasn't there. My wife found my sister holding her in her bedroom with the door closed and I guess the baby was in different clothing, with a fresh diaper and this set my wife completely off (she doesn't want anyone but us changing her- childhood trauma PTSD). I immediately told my sister to get the fuck out of our house. She tried explaining that she was \"just trying to help\" but I told her I didn't give a fuck anymore. Leave. She has no where to go and that was argued but I told her I didn't care. Go on the streets for all I care. My mom (in a nursing home) is saying I'm pushing this too far because she was just thinking she was being helpful. My sister is gone and I don't regret it. AITA?\n\nETA: She's being seen by her doctor. We meet with the therapist her doctor recommended twice a week. They don't have her on meds or anything (not sure if that's even an option?) because she's nursing and she is worried about it. But her therapist has given me kind of a guide line to follow, I guess you could say. What to look out for. What to do/what not to do. I'm very involved with the process but it's a learning curve for all of us. We also have a visiting nurse who comes by to check on the baby AND my wife. The babies diaper did NOT need to be changed. I had just changed her right before I left and round trip to the store is only 15 minutes. My sister confirmed that the diaper \"didn't look soiled\".", "created_utc": 1686413438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14643z1/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_even_though_she/", "score": 657, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Same breakfast, same lunch, same dinner, same snack, same amount of water to drink at the same time. Go outside for 5 minutes 2-3 times a day at the same time, etc.  Her whole day should be as scheduled as possible.

Well long story short we ignored him and went to the ER where the baby was immediately admitted to the hospital for dehydration and put in an IV and given formula..

Is her defense basically that she\u2019s right and your wife is wrong?\n\nRegardless, she needs to work within you and your wife\u2019s boundaries or move out ASAP. You both need to be able to trust her to weigh you and your wife\u2019s instructions and what\u2019s best for you, your wife, and the baby against what she wants to do. Right now you can\u2019t. \n\nShe escalated the situation in multiple ways and for no good reason.\n\nShe could have chosen to sit in the same room and hold the baby.

And now I\u2019ll add this\u2026\nHaving had a very traumatic birth with my first son, his being medically fragile and in the NICU for a period of time and -YEARS LATER- having had a hysterectomy, your wife is in a SERIOUS SPIRAL! The hormones and emotions and triggers of anything from her past are all converging. I literally cannot even IMAGINE the depths of horror what your sister did caused your wife. It\u2019s infuriating and you were absolutely within your rights to do what you did. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll suggest is that THE MINUTE she\u2019s able, (3 months is what I recall) she needs to be seen at an HRT center for testosterone, estradiol and progesterone levels. The surge and crash will have an incredible impact on her mental processing abilities and leveling them will help her, you, your daughter and your marriage. \n\nBless you for protecting your wife when she\u2019s at her most vulnerable.", "NTA - your sister was sneaky about it and pushing boundaries starting day one. If she wanted to be helpful she would have found other ways (making wife meals, cleaning the whole house, going to the store so you as a trusted person could be with your wife and would not need to leave her side, etc.) to be helpful. She is just selfish and wants time with the baby herself. She probably has her own struggles but you can\u2019t help her with that now, you need to focus on your wife and daughter. It probably will be better longterm to not have the sister meddling around with the child and behaving like she was the third parent only because she can\u2019t have any herself.\n\nYou need to protect your family, and you are doing well imo.", "NTA\n\nShe got tired of asking permission, and figured on just going for forgiveness.

If she really wanted to help she\u2019d cook dinner or clean the loo\u2026", "NTA. My unsolicited advice is for your wife to seriously consider going on medication, even if it means stopping breastfeeding. Fed is best and formula is fine. This may be a tough sell as there's a lot of pressure on new moms to breastfeed and a lot of shaming surrounding breastfeeding versus formula feeding, but your wife's symptoms and distress sound pretty severe and she doesn't have to feel this bad and shouldn't have to feel this bad. Sleep deprivation exacerbates depression and anxiety too. And being in a constant state of hypervigilance takes a toll that your wife doesn't need right now. \n\nYour wife deserves to be able to experience the joys of new motherhood as well as the stress. Some mental health issues will not resolve without medication intervention. It doesn't mean she'd have to be on medication forever, but your daughter's well-being is tied to her parents' mental well-being and your wife is suffering right now. So, maybe something to mull over and talk about in therapy with your wife and her therapist and/or doctor. I know it's a delicate subject and finding the right medication isn't always easy, but I hate that your wife is suffering so much and I'm concerned that her mental health could decline further.", "NTA.

She doesn't have the right to just go in and take the baby when she knows she's not allowed.\n\nYour wife's mental health sounds really difficult on you both. I hope ya'll can get it worked out. It must be really hard for her too to be living with this paranoia and panick.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister was trying to help, in these fragile fresh overwhelming days, she would hold the baby IN THE ROOM while your wife slept, and ease her trauma anxiety by assuring her she can and will respect boundaries... \n\nSince she can't, having her in the house is going to feel threatening and triggering to your wife. She will now be afraid to sleep, in case it happens again.\n\nYour sister is oblivious. She has no idea what PTSD is like, or post partum depression, let alone both. \n\nMake sure your wife has the medical support she needs (her doctor should be aware, and while it may be too soon to loop a therapist in helpfully, given their wait times, it might be good to find and set up those appointments now. And ask if it's helpful in the interim to have YOU meet with them so they can give you guidelines for what your wife might need, that isn't well meaning but inaccurate advice from your sister.)\n\nAnd if you can, get some help in that does know how to help with all this? Maybe for a while hiring a nurse to come give respite care, especially if your wife can let a medical professional change diapers or do a little more...  And otherwise, plan for how to make sure your wife can sleep knowing baby is safe.\n\n(Get a sidecar for the bed, so wife can see baby, knows she will hear baby, can even sleep with a hand ON baby, but not worry she'll squish baby or have baby roll out of bed or suffocate under adult blankets. In this moment, anything she CAN worry about, her brain is going to feed her like ice cream.)", "I think you over reacted. But it's understandable given the state your wife is in. It's a tense time.

The diaper wasn\u2019t soiled (full of poop) but was it wet (full of urine) or did she pee on her clothing? Was clothing stained with milk she ate and eventually spit up? Was she overheated with what she was wearing? Was she crying a lot? Because those could be reasons to change her diaper and clothes. Does your sister know about your wife\u2019s hysterectomy and post partum depression diagnosis? \n\nIt\u2019s good that wife is seeing a therapist and has a treatment plan for postpartum depression, but the current treatment plan doesn\u2019t seem to be working.

However, her taking the baby out of the room seems like extremely poor judgement, given what she knows about the situation.\n\nI guess I wonder if you could have looped her in more with the reality of the situation, and redirected her wish to help towards other things like lightening the burden or chores. I did see you mentioned she doesn\u2019t really do chores, so for those reasons it\u2019s hard not to lean towards her being the asshole.

And PTSD mixed with post partum can get dangerous. \n\nShe can't be the only one who looks after the baby. One person is incapable of meeting every single need of a newborn. I don't know what the road is forward, but I would DEFINITELY talk to your GP about it.\n\nI commend you for supporting your wife, but this is beyond post partum. There's trauma from her childhood AND the birth that are affecting her wellbeing, and your sister isn't a bad person for holding and changing the baby while a new mom sleeps. Your wife will not heal without sleep, she will break. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving a soft YTA is because you mentioned that your sister is barren or just childless as if that somehow invalidates her, or her thoughts on helping. At 46 I'm sure she's spent a ton of time at friends places with newborns, helping out. If she always wanted children but never had any of her own there's a good chance she has spent more time with newborns than you have. And also, y'know, kicking her out of her own house for doing what any sane person would do when a new mom is sleeping, a baby starts to fuss, and blows our their diaper.\n\nAccept help man, your wife is barely above water right now and would rather never sleep/have her baby sit in a soiled diaper while she naps than have your sister help out? In terms of the baby's needs, and that's not healthy. And in terms of your wife's needs vs what her brain is telling her right now, she's in much more trouble than you may think.", "YTA\n\nYou and your wife need to sleep.", "YTA, she needs to sleep lol and chill a bit, this is not normal, lack of sleep is not healthy at all. You overreacted  and idc what others say here, sister didn't have to take the baby in her bedroom and change the diaper unless there was a good reason but you said the diaper didn't have to be changed. She was trying to help and you kicked her out, well next time get a sister who doesn't give a flying f about any of you if that's what you want. Might as well be soft ESH", " YTA, moms probably sleep deprived and you seem to be feeding into her delusion by doing things like staying in the shower with the baby, freaking out to that extent is not healthy. Sister was trying to help.", "YTA. So much could have been discussed before kicking out your sister who is KIND out the curb. Did she need to adjust her behavior, yes. But no reason to go nuclear.\n\nDid sister help with chores? \n\nHave you considered that as your wife gets less panicked (is she doing therapy?), sister could have very helpful in child-rearing? One more adult to love and care for your child?\n\nSeems like you exploded and acted on anger,  which is the worst advisor. \n\nWhen I was born my mother had her tubes tied, out of choice, so she was a more careful mother than most. But it was temporary. \n\nYour wife is grieving her lost uterus. Your sister should not take the brunt of that frustration, it's unfair. Go make up with her. \n\nPeople who are well-meaning and kind must be kept close.", "Soft ESH.\n\nKicking her out is a bit extreme - I'm sure there was another way you could've asked her to help during this time.\n\nI know you say you're getting your wife help, but it sounds way beyond any \"regular\" post natal depression. This is some sort of... Borderline psychosis. Her behaviour towards your daughter is bit frightening.\n\nSod the breast feeding - get your wife help, now.", "This sounds like a tough situation. On the one hand it is your house and you have every right to request that she leave, and especially seeing as you're being so accommodating to your wife during such a difficult period, it would not have been that hard for your sister to just follow along in regards to how you guys want to handle the baby. I am sure you explained your wife's situation to her, yes? And her response was to push back?\n\nIf a conversation took place about clear boundaries on what was and was not acceptable, such as no changing the baby due to the childhood PTSD, and she blatantly ignored it and pushed past them anyways, then your sister would definitely be the asshole.\n\nIf there wasn't, and you jumped straight to kicking her out when she had nowhere else to go, then you'd be the asshole, but justified.\n\nThere are breast feeding save meds your wife can take to help her condition, but getting zero sleep is going to only make her worse and worse, so something definitely needs to be done there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a complicated delivery and she ended up needing a hysterectomy. Our daughter is perfect however and we are very overjoyed that she is still with us. She's doing great. My wife, not so much. She has postpartum depression and she cries a lot. There's been a complete lack of sleep. She's up basically all night panicking and making sure our daughter is breathing and she won't let anyone take her out of her sight. \n\nMy sister (46f), who lives with us and could never have kids of her own, has been basically hounding us to \"just let her help\" by taking the baby for a few hours so we can sleep. As I said, my wife will not let the baby out of her sight. She immediately panics. Even if she showers she has to have the baby in there (I hold her in the bathroom while my wife showers). I am more than willing to make all accomodations I need to in order for my wife to heal mentally. My sister on the other hand keeps pushing it and saying that I am enabling my wife's behavior and \"making her worse\" by not basically forcing her to get a break and get some sleep. \n\nWell, I went to the store yesterday and when I got back, my wife was in a complete meltdown. Apparently she had fallen asleep and when she woke up, the baby wasn't there. My wife found my sister holding her in her bedroom with the door closed and I guess the baby was in different clothing, with a fresh diaper and this set my wife completely off (she doesn't want anyone but us changing her- childhood trauma PTSD). I immediately told my sister to get the fuck out of our house. She tried explaining that she was \"just trying to help\" but I told her I didn't give a fuck anymore. Leave. She has no where to go and that was argued but I told her I didn't care. Go on the streets for all I care. My mom (in a nursing home) is saying I'm pushing this too far because she was just thinking she was being helpful. My sister is gone and I don't regret it.

Even if she's nursing, there are helpful medications that doctors can prescribe that are less likely to be passed through milk. She may need a psychiatrist to prescribe it if her regular doctor isn't comfortable with it. My doctor is actually a psychiatrist who was a trained pediatrician and worked with me to find medication that was safe while nursing due to ppd. \n\nBut don't feel bad for drawing a boundary around your sister.

She's clearly seeing that your wife is having trouble adjusting to motherhood and a traumatic event that happened during that time, and she still chooses to push the boundaries. \n\nI will say this that your wife definitely needs to seek counsel and therapy, but in the current scenario and by the way you're being patient with your wife's issues, I don't think that'll be a problem.", "NTA btw your wife needs additional help if possible, can a nurse come more? can any more people be enlisted to help?

And when things weren't going quickly enough, they wanted a c-section. We were fine, but they were brought in from a different location because my doctor was on vacation and wanted to go home. And I had a lot of anxiety after her birth.  I had a hard time letting her leave my sight. And my birth wasn't as horrible as your wife. \n\nYour sister should have done other things to help.

Mother has a hysterectomy during birth and also then finds out her child is in intensive care at the same time she is trying to recover from both major surgery and the physical and hormonal healing of that, establishing her routine as a brand new mother with no prior experience but probably lots and lots of blogs and videos online from mothers who highlight the most harrowing and self centered and self righteous way of parenting a newborn- a classic scenario of \u201cthey say\u201d. \n\nOP, I didn\u2019t have PPD but prior to my son, I had never held a baby, changed a diaper, etc and I was terrified. The crib was across the hall and I made my husband sleep with both doors open and a baby monitor on because I was scared I would miss something and cause harm. Your wife is scared.
