{"id": 19458, "submission_id": "14643z1", "title": "AITA for kicking my sister out, even though she was \"just trying to help\"?", "selftext": "My wife and I just welcomed our first and last baby in to this world 2 weeks ago. It was a complicated delivery and she ended up needing a hysterectomy. Our daughter is perfect however and we are very overjoyed that she is still with us. She's doing great. My wife, not so much. She has postpartum depression and she cries a lot. There's been a complete lack of sleep. She's up basically all night panicking and making sure our daughter is breathing and she won't let anyone take her out of her sight. \n\nMy sister (46f), who lives with us and could never have kids of her own, has been basically hounding us to \"just let her help\" by taking the baby for a few hours so we can sleep. As I said, my wife will not let the baby out of her sight. She immediately panics. Even if she showers she has to have the baby in there (I hold her in the bathroom while my wife showers). I am more than willing to make all accomodations I need to in order for my wife to heal mentally. My sister on the other hand keeps pushing it and saying that I am enabling my wife's behavior and \"making her worse\" by not basically forcing her to get a break and get some sleep. \n\nWell, I went to the store yesterday and when I got back, my wife was in a complete meltdown. Apparently she had fallen asleep and when she woke up, the baby wasn't there. My wife found my sister holding her in her bedroom with the door closed and I guess the baby was in different clothing, with a fresh diaper and this set my wife completely off (she doesn't want anyone but us changing her- childhood trauma PTSD). I immediately told my sister to get the fuck out of our house. She tried explaining that she was \"just trying to help\" but I told her I didn't give a fuck anymore. Leave. She has no where to go and that was argued but I told her I didn't care. Go on the streets for all I care. My mom (in a nursing home) is saying I'm pushing this too far because she was just thinking she was being helpful. My sister is gone and I don't regret it. AITA?\n\nETA: She's being seen by her doctor. We meet with the therapist her doctor recommended twice a week. They don't have her on meds or anything (not sure if that's even an option?) because she's nursing and she is worried about it. But her therapist has given me kind of a guide line to follow, I guess you could say. What to look out for. What to do/what not to do. I'm very involved with the process but it's a learning curve for all of us. We also have a visiting nurse who comes by to check on the baby AND my wife. The babies diaper did NOT need to be changed. I had just changed her right before I left and round trip to the store is only 15 minutes. My sister confirmed that the diaper \"didn't look soiled\".", "created_utc": 1686413438, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14643z1/aita_for_kicking_my_sister_out_even_though_she/", "score": 2988, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The right type and amount of meds might be a moving target right now.\n\nRight now routines will be very very very important, fear can be mitigated by having as much predictability as possible.  Your sister\u2019s response caused anxiety, good for you for kicking her out.  Figure out healthy meals and snacks for one day.  Then that\u2019s what she eats for the whole week.  Same breakfast, same lunch, same dinner, same snack, same amount of water to drink at the same time. Go outside for 5 minutes 2-3 times a day at the same time, etc.  Her whole day should be as scheduled as possible.  Yes your daughter will not cooperate or be on a schedule but your wife needs her days to be predictable as possible.  \n\nYou and your wife have had a traumatic experience.

Well long story short we ignored him and went to the ER where the baby was immediately admitted to the hospital for dehydration and put in an IV and given formula.. (Also she's back to breast milk exclusively since then)\n\nBreast feeding is **Ideal** but billions of healthy happy babies have been raised on formula.

It's can and most often is BRUTEL. as in, \"regular\" meno is normally gradual and the loss of hormones is then, also gradual. With post birth hormones already going haywire, post surgical meno it's absolutely bat shit out of whack. \n\nDiscuss with the doctor about this or get a referral to a meno specialist (unsure about how it is in us)\n\nThere's none of the gradual peri meno phase. It's full blown straight away. Not sure regarding hrt and breast feeding, but they would normally go straight onto some form of hrt afterwards.

I'm very concerned that your wife is sacrificing her mental health in order to provide beast milk. Which I understand, there is A LOT of pressure to BF, it's very hard to not be affected by it and the sheer guilt of not being able to do it/continue doing it...

If she doesn't get help, things could get worse. \n\nKeep your daughter safe.", "Your sister doesn't get to dictate what help your wife needs.

She\u2019s not the protagonist here.\n\nInfo: does your sis have any history of mental health issues, miscarriages, or any recent severe emotional upsets? Does her behavior make sense to you? Is her defense basically that she\u2019s right and your wife is wrong?\n\nRegardless, she needs to work within you and your wife\u2019s boundaries or move out ASAP. You both need to be able to trust her to weigh you and your wife\u2019s instructions and what\u2019s best for you, your wife, and the baby against what she wants to do. Right now you can\u2019t. \n\nShe escalated the situation in multiple ways and for no good reason.\n\nShe could have chosen to sit in the same room and hold the baby.

And now I\u2019ll add this\u2026\nHaving had a very traumatic birth with my first son, his being medically fragile and in the NICU for a period of time and -YEARS LATER- having had a hysterectomy, your wife is in a SERIOUS SPIRAL! The hormones and emotions and triggers of anything from her past are all converging. I literally cannot even IMAGINE the depths of horror what your sister did caused your wife. It\u2019s infuriating and you were absolutely within your rights to do what you did. \n\nOne thing I\u2019ll suggest is that THE MINUTE she\u2019s able, (3 months is what I recall) she needs to be seen at an HRT center for testosterone, estradiol and progesterone levels. The surge and crash will have an incredible impact on her mental processing abilities and leveling them will help her, you, your daughter and your marriage. \n\nBless you for protecting your wife when she\u2019s at her most vulnerable.", "NTA - your sister was sneaky about it and pushing boundaries starting day one. If she wanted to be helpful she would have found other ways (making wife meals, cleaning the whole house, going to the store so you as a trusted person could be with your wife and would not need to leave her side, etc.) to be helpful. She is just selfish and wants time with the baby herself. She probably has her own struggles but you can\u2019t help her with that now, you need to focus on your wife and daughter. It probably will be better longterm to not have the sister meddling around with the child and behaving like she was the third parent only because she can\u2019t have any herself.\n\nYou need to protect your family, and you are doing well imo.", "NTA\n\nShe got tired of asking permission, and figured on just going for forgiveness.

If she really wanted to help she\u2019d cook dinner or clean the loo\u2026", "NTA. My unsolicited advice is for your wife to seriously consider going on medication, even if it means stopping breastfeeding. Fed is best and formula is fine. This may be a tough sell as there's a lot of pressure on new moms to breastfeed and a lot of shaming surrounding breastfeeding versus formula feeding, but your wife's symptoms and distress sound pretty severe and she doesn't have to feel this bad and shouldn't have to feel this bad. Sleep deprivation exacerbates depression and anxiety too. And being in a constant state of hypervigilance takes a toll that your wife doesn't need right now. \n\nYour wife deserves to be able to experience the joys of new motherhood as well as the stress. Some mental health issues will not resolve without medication intervention. It doesn't mean she'd have to be on medication forever, but your daughter's well-being is tied to her parents' mental well-being and your wife is suffering right now. So, maybe something to mull over and talk about in therapy with your wife and her therapist and/or doctor. I know it's a delicate subject and finding the right medication isn't always easy, but I hate that your wife is suffering so much and I'm concerned that her mental health could decline further.", "NTA.

It must be really hard for her too to be living with this paranoia and panick.", "NTA\n\nIf your sister was trying to help, in these fragile fresh overwhelming days, she would hold the baby IN THE ROOM while your wife slept, and ease her trauma anxiety by assuring her she can and will respect boundaries... \n\nSince she can't, having her in the house is going to feel threatening and triggering to your wife. She will now be afraid to sleep, in case it happens again.\n\nYour sister is oblivious. She has no idea what PTSD is like, or post partum depression, let alone both. \n\nMake sure your wife has the medical support she needs (her doctor should be aware, and while it may be too soon to loop a therapist in helpfully, given their wait times, it might be good to find and set up those appointments now. And ask if it's helpful in the interim to have YOU meet with them so they can give you guidelines for what your wife might need, that isn't well meaning but inaccurate advice from your sister.)\n\nAnd if you can, get some help in that does know how to help with all this? Maybe for a while hiring a nurse to come give respite care, especially if your wife can let a medical professional change diapers or do a little more...  And otherwise, plan for how to make sure your wife can sleep knowing baby is safe.\n\n(Get a sidecar for the bed, so wife can see baby, knows she will hear baby, can even sleep with a hand ON baby, but not worry she'll squish baby or have baby roll out of bed or suffocate under adult blankets. In this moment, anything she CAN worry about, her brain is going to feed her like ice cream.)", "I think you over reacted. But it's understandable given the state your wife is in. It's a tense time.

The diaper wasn\u2019t soiled (full of poop) but was it wet (full of urine) or did she pee on her clothing? Was clothing stained with milk she ate and eventually spit up? Was she overheated with what she was wearing? Was she crying a lot? Because those could be reasons to change her diaper and clothes. Does your sister know about your wife\u2019s hysterectomy and post partum depression diagnosis? \n\nIt\u2019s good that wife is seeing a therapist and has a treatment plan for postpartum depression, but the current treatment plan doesn\u2019t seem to be working.

However, her taking the baby out of the room seems like extremely poor judgement, given what she knows about the situation.\n\nI guess I wonder if you could have looped her in more with the reality of the situation, and redirected her wish to help towards other things like lightening the burden or chores. I did see you mentioned she doesn\u2019t really do chores, so for those reasons it\u2019s hard not to lean towards her being the asshole.

And this was after a traumatic pregnancy, birth, and 3 weeks in the NICU as my nephew was born at 32 weeks. \n\nLook, post partum is brutal, that amount of hormones flooding and leaving your body is absolutely insane. But it sounds like your wife has more than post partum. This sounds like legitimate PTSD from her own childhood, likely exacerbated by her most recent trauma of childbirth + post partum. And PTSD mixed with post partum can get dangerous. \n\nShe can't be the only one who looks after the baby. One person is incapable of meeting every single need of a newborn. I don't know what the road is forward, but I would DEFINITELY talk to your GP about it.\n\nI commend you for supporting your wife, but this is beyond post partum. There's trauma from her childhood AND the birth that are affecting her wellbeing, and your sister isn't a bad person for holding and changing the baby while a new mom sleeps. Your wife will not heal without sleep, she will break. \n\nThe only reason I'm giving a soft YTA is because you mentioned that your sister is barren or just childless as if that somehow invalidates her, or her thoughts on helping. At 46 I'm sure she's spent a ton of time at friends places with newborns, helping out. If she always wanted children but never had any of her own there's a good chance she has spent more time with newborns than you have. And also, y'know, kicking her out of her own house for doing what any sane person would do when a new mom is sleeping, a baby starts to fuss, and blows our their diaper.\n\nAccept help man, your wife is barely above water right now and would rather never sleep/have her baby sit in a soiled diaper while she naps than have your sister help out? In terms of the baby's needs, and that's not healthy.

One more adult to love and care for your child?\n\nSeems like you exploded and acted on anger,  which is the worst advisor. \n\nWhen I was born my mother had her tubes tied, out of choice, so she was a more careful mother than most.

This is some sort of... Borderline psychosis. Her behaviour towards your daughter is bit frightening.\n\nSod the breast feeding - get your wife help, now.", "This sounds like a tough situation. On the one hand it is your house and you have every right to request that she leave, and especially seeing as you're being so accommodating to your wife during such a difficult period, it would not have been that hard for your sister to just follow along in regards to how you guys want to handle the baby. I am sure you explained your wife's situation to her, yes? And her response was to push back?\n\nIf a conversation took place about clear boundaries on what was and was not acceptable, such as no changing the baby due to the childhood PTSD, and she blatantly ignored it and pushed past them anyways, then your sister would definitely be the asshole.\n\nIf there wasn't, and you jumped straight to kicking her out when she had nowhere else to go, then you'd be the asshole, but justified.\n\nThere are breast feeding save meds your wife can take to help her condition, but getting zero sleep is going to only make her worse and worse, so something definitely needs to be done there.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It was a complicated delivery and she ended up needing a hysterectomy. Our daughter is perfect however and we are very overjoyed that she is still with us. She's doing great. My wife, not so much. She has postpartum depression and she cries a lot. There's been a complete lack of sleep. She's up basically all night panicking and making sure our daughter is breathing and she won't let anyone take her out of her sight. \n\nMy sister (46f), who lives with us and could never have kids of her own, has been basically hounding us to \"just let her help\" by taking the baby for a few hours so we can sleep. As I said, my wife will not let the baby out of her sight. She immediately panics. Even if she showers she has to have the baby in there (I hold her in the bathroom while my wife showers). I am more than willing to make all accomodations I need to in order for my wife to heal mentally. My sister on the other hand keeps pushing it and saying that I am enabling my wife's behavior and \"making her worse\" by not basically forcing her to get a break and get some sleep. \n\nWell, I went to the store yesterday and when I got back, my wife was in a complete meltdown. Apparently she had fallen asleep and when she woke up, the baby wasn't there. My wife found my sister holding her in her bedroom with the door closed and I guess the baby was in different clothing, with a fresh diaper and this set my wife completely off (she doesn't want anyone but us changing her- childhood trauma PTSD). I immediately told my sister to get the fuck out of our house. She tried explaining that she was \"just trying to help\" but I told her I didn't give a fuck anymore. Leave. She has no where to go and that was argued but I told her I didn't care. Go on the streets for all I care. My mom (in a nursing home) is saying I'm pushing this too far because she was just thinking she was being helpful. My sister is gone and I don't regret it.

She FINALLY fell asleep, anybody caring about the mother would remove the baby from the room to leave mama to get some much needed rest. She did everything she could to make the baby not fuss, and yes probably enjoyed some bonding time with your baby. You are very blessed to have a sister who begs to help out and wants to be there for you guys and the baby. Many people don\u2019t have anybody willing to help out in that way. You are both sleep deprived and hormonal. What she did came from a place of love, I hope you will not burn this bridge over something so small.

Strange. \n\nYeah, major AHs. \n\n\nI mean, you've had a tough pregnancy. Your wife's body needs rest. Above everything, you have a sister who's actively and willingly helping you with everything because she lives with you. It does take a village to raise a child. If your sister had done it when your wife was awake, I might have considered her a slight TA because she wasn't respecting her \"wishes\". But no, your wife fell ASLEEP WHILE CARING FOR A NEWBORN ALONE. What did you expect your sister to do? Let the baby cry and wail? Let the baby stay in a dirty diaper and get a rash? Have soiled clothes? Even if the diaper\"didn't look soiled\", do you expect any reasonable person to leave a baby unattended while mom fell asleep, especially with a case as complicated as your wife? That's literally what newborns do for around 4-6 months. They need constant and active care. If your wife has PPD, you really should grab all the help coming your way in all the forms. Your sister might be childless, but she's older than you and has seen the world. \n\nI'm assuming you're in mid 20s (please correct me if I am wrong). Your sister is almost double your age. All I can see here is a middle aged woman helping her exhausted newly-parent bro and SIL, and you show her no respect and kicked her out. Your mother is right. You and your wife are assholes. You much more, because she's still recovering from both physical and mental health issues and might react this way. But as this sub overwhelmingly says: being sick/troubled/disabled/recovering/pregnant is no excuse for being an asshole. \n\nDownvote all you want, but this couple is either too entitled and rude, or they have not grasped the idea that raising a baby is not all roses and flowers. \nMoreover you illegally evicted your sister. \n\nThe way you talk about your sister is so disrespectful. I would recommend you to bring her back with due respect, grovel for apology, and sit together with her and your wife and come to mutual solutions. Establish boundaries if you are so dead set on what your wife is feeling, but remember, boundaries don't happen to be one sided.

Honestly what your sister did, this situation specifically posted here is a good doing, except the part she got the kid out of your wife's sight, don't get me wrong taking the kids without asking first was a big no no, but you need to start thinking, the baby can't move much as she's still a newborn, but when she does, just the two of you keeping an eye would be difficult and will put your daughter in danger.

Most doctors worth their salt will tell you that having a happy, healthy mom is far better for a baby's well-being than being exclusively breastfed.\n\nThat said, your sister is very obviously going through something, too. If she wanted kids but never had them, that's especially difficult to face when there's another baby around. I'd strongly recommend that you urge your sister to seek help with her mental help, too. Perhaps make that a predicate to her seeing the baby again, and, if she's as desperate for a living situation as it sounds, and there's a *marked* improvement in her attitude towards your boundaries, perhaps y'all can talk about her moving back in.

Your sister was trying to be helpful but she crossed heavy boundaries and her solution on how to \"fix your wife\" is not correct and can create new trauma.

Very slow baby steps have to happen and you're so amazing for helping g your wife and accommodating so much. You're so strong for doing this and I know it eases your wife's mind so much by how helpful you're being. This is a very tough road for her.

And your wife's behaviour is very worrisome, too. How do you envisage your child growing up? Full of anxiety, for that is the message she will get from her mum. Afraid of everything. And at one point it needs to go to school. Children need to develop and learn some independency. This behaviour will become really harmful when the child is a little older.

I\u2019d say the sister is the one with deeper issues than a woman who is flooded with hormones and obviously can\u2019t trust a guest in her home. \n\nNTA. Get your sister out of the house. Keep an eye on your wife and know the signs of PPD/psychosis/anxiety but don\u2019t create more stress for yourself by reading these comments and thinking your wife is out to kill your baby. Continue to support your wife, and if issues continue or your wife isn\u2019t feel any better after this period, check in with the doctor on medications or other treatments that can help resolve her anxiety around the baby.\n\nEdited to add: none of this behaviour is normal. But I\u2019m wondering if your sisters behaviour is what is creating so much anxiety for your wife. I\u2019m a nurse and I honestly think your sister needs to go so your wife is not on edge about someone always wanting to take the baby from her (even when she\u2019s ASLEEP). Many mothers want to take time to bond with their baby after they give birth and it\u2019s even becoming a trend to enjoy time as a family before handing baby around at family functions etc.", "Agreed. Reading that I couldn\u2019t help but think NTA but Jesus Bruce Lee Christ none of this seems remotely ok or like it\u2019s on the right path.", "Yeah, sister overstepped clear boundaries, but this...\n\n>Even if she showers she has to have the baby in there (I hold her in the bathroom while my wife showers). I am more than willing to make all accomodations I need to in order for my wife to heal mentally.\n\nDoes not sound healthy. \n\nAnd how does OP feel about this? That his partner doesnt trust him with their own baby for 15 minutes? He says theyre getting professional help, but what steps are actually being taken, what are the goals, what are the milestones. Being able to shower for a few minutes without the baby sounds like an early one. Being left to sleep uninterrupted for a few hours, especially considering she just had major surgery, sounds like another. \n\nIt might be for the wrong reasons, cuz it sounds like she has her own issues, but sister is right.", "Also, the fact that she\u2019s this bad and not on meds (even though there are safe meds, and by OPs comments didn\u2019t even know there were safe meds) makes me believe they\u2019re both downplaying the wife\u2019s mental status to both the doctor and the therapist. The doctor and therapist would already know there are bf safe meds, and likely would have suggested them already.", "That's The more sane comment here", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.

OP, your wife needs more help than she is currently getting. Do something now.", "I do agree so much. I was afraid to say so and am glad you did. I am really really worried about the mother's behaviour (about the sister's behaviour, too, if the story is a true depiction of how things went). I would not dare to leave her alone. She is, at the moment, not capable of taking care of a child.", "This is straight up false. They very rarely take ovaries in someone who has had a hysterectomy anymore. And especially not someone who is still in her child-bearing age (20s-30s). While there may be an adjustment period because of the manipulation of ovaries during surgery (and also because she is postpartum), as long as her ovaries weren\u2019t taken she would not enter surgical menopause and would not need HRT. \n\nIf they happened to take her ovaries (in very rare circumstances), her OBGYN would have most certainly discussed the need for HRT at her young age.", "Only a complete and utter moron would actually think that any parent who wakes up and sees their newborn gone from where they left them wouldn\u2019t have an absolute panic attack, even without PPD.\n\nSo either sister is a complete moron, or this was never about \u2018helping\u2019. Im leaning towards both", "This is part of the reason as an educator I try to crush the \"breast is best\" stuff. \n\nI tech my students that breastfeeding should continue as long as mutually beneficial for mom and baby. Once either party finds the arrangement untenable we can keep baby very health with other solutions.", "You are always sleep deprived for the first few weeks. You also hurt a lot, so sleep is even harder. I'm wondering if mom has been getting weird vibes from the sister.. I mean who completely changes a child's clothes down to a diaper when they don't need it?", "Yes, because the wife being unable to leave the same room as the baby is definitely healthy. OP needing to literally have the baby in the bathroom while she showers is not normal behaviour. It's bordering on psychosis.\n\nI think ill have to go with NAH.

When that\u2019s 100% true?!", "Sounds great. unfortunately sister is right. Wife is in co condition to take care of the baby.", "After my hysterectomy, I spiraled out so bad I thought I would hurt myself or someone else.  I\u2019ve never felt such despair and darkness.  \n\nMy doc put me on HRT (as he should have done in the first place), and everything was okay two days later.  \n\nIt\u2019s a shame that no one has given this woman hormones.  That estrogen drop is absolutely murderous on the soul.", "Also who changes a clean diaper? Sis is sus. Mother probably can't put her finger on it, but knows something's not right.", "Totally agree with your comment! I feel so bad for OP\u2019s wife. To have all these fears, to finally relax and take a nap, and to wake up to her biggest fear, baby being gone from where she left her. If wife had woken up and seen everything was fine, maybe the fear would\u2019ve lessened some. Instead, all the sister did was strengthen that fear and make it that much harder for her to relax the next time. This breaks my heart. \n\nOP you are NTA for kicking your sister out.

I had my OBGYN and a therapist helping me, my therapist told my husband what to watch out for and what not to do - one of which was take the baby away from me, especially if I was sleeping. Obviously, he could take the baby but just stay in the same room. I got better, and medication wasn't necessary. Medication is great and works wonders for some people but not for everyone.", "Reading more comments and putting some things together, I suspect they don't have her on meds right *now* because they theust her into surgical menopause and she's in recovery from the birthing trauma in general. When her hormones and such ease up, they'll probably start trying medication.", "Medication may be necessary but I know from my experience with PPA and previous PTSD, medication made it worse, it would help one thing but it would make something else worse. Of course, everyone is very different and it may be that they are hoping to see how she does with just therapy first, after all, it's only been 2 weeks.", "The baby was in the curb, didn't need to change, yet sister took them, lock herself in her room and changed them. From OP's comments she doesn't help them in any way only barge into their room for \"baby snuggles\".", "Sister hasn't offered any other help than holding the baby, no cooking, chores etc. Sister also has been allowed to hold the baby and help, just not to change or take baby out of the mom's sight. But she did as soon as mom fell asleep.", "I had just had my 2nd baby and had a small toddler who was also needing attention, toddler is shy and doesn't like anyone she doesn't see regularly and baby was crying because he was 3 weeks old.

He is not enabling, he is helping her. Sister was out of line. I think her therapist and doctor are a lot more well equipped to say what will help her.", "Gonna agree with this take too. Throwing out your sister for anything other than actively endangering the life of someone in your family here is just you not being able to cope with the situation either. You, my friend, also have post partum depression and/or anxiety and also need treatment.

I was just learning to be a parent and didn't want or need anyone else taking care of him or help me hold him.\n\nAll the people calling it unhealthy are unreasonable. By the time the child learns to walk, most mothers typically calm down and are not going to become helicopter parents. \n\nIt's just that when the babies are that small and helpless, where they can't communicate their needs and need to be cared for 24 hours, some mothers have a stronger need to protect and care for the baby. And that's perfecly ok. I dislike people shouting therapy when a new mother can't let go of the baby.\n\nOnce they're older everyone automatically calms down. It definitely happened for me. My children, knowing that I always hold and protect them when they need it, where very open and fearless once they started walking.", "To give her the benefit of every doubt, I think it\u2019s possible OP\u2019s sister recognized that Wife\u2019s feelings were not rational.

It\u2019s unbelievably common and most of the time is done by relatives or close family friends. From the sisters pov she was just trying to help, from the mothers, the sister could be a threat to her child\u2019s life.

Don\u2019t feel guilty for anything, especially not for making the right choice for yourself and your baby", "I feel like I could have written this.", "I'm so sorry. I just feel terrible for every woman who is subjected to that kind of shit. It's absolutely inexcusable, utterly indefensible.", "So much fucking projection. The one that literally abducted the child isn't the danger, the mother upset the child was abducted is.", "It definitely might not be sexism. And like a said a shocking amount of doctors don't know how safe it is. It's honestly so safe even if it is sleep deprivation they should probably prescribe it to help lower her anxiety so she can get some sleep. \n\nIt's pretty concerning considering how extreme OPs wife is presenting, and how traumatic it seems the birth was, that they don't even know it's an option. I'm not trying to assume the worst however I think as a baseline most people want to believe in doctors. I think it's important OP knows those things happen so he can advocate for his wife.", "Except, Treatment is part of the situation. You're right this should be left to professionals. But OP asked. So they answered. If anything, stand by your own convictions and leave the thread.", "That part is honestly insane. Go through a major medical event (sometimes a major abdominal surgery), but instead of getting any time to recover, you will not be allowed to sleep and you are now responsible for this entirely helpless creature that needs 24/7 care and that you must feed only with your own body whether you want to or not. \n\nOh, and we won\u2019t even give you a pacifier even if you ask for one. \ud83d\ude44", "Spoiler alert: They aren\u2019t.", "They're baby friendly in the sense that moms don't matter anymore, only the child. So dehumanizing.", "What an awful doctor. Did he at least apologize to your daughter? My mom could never produce enough milk for me and my brothers too, all of us were weaned by 3 months old and we all turned out just fine!", "Worked as a pediatric nurse for years and I\u2019ve seen too many moms blame themselves because they cannot breastfeed adequately and no mom should feel guilty about that. Thank God you were there to help you daughter because the doc should have checked for other possible explanations for baby\u2019s weight loss, did a lactation consult and at least instruct your daughter on what formula to start with (if he didn\u2019t).", "Same...my wife came home from the hospital while boy was in NICU. She went up to feed. Lactation specialists, etc. He came home & she just could not produce much milk. She was exhausted from lack of sleep. Boy was crying a lot too. Finally late at night I went to the grocery & got some formula. Fed him & Mom slept for a good long time. Her health was as important as his. She was also recovering from C section. We did not really get much push back from the hospital. From then on I was the 2:00 am feed person", "I was put on something for preeclampsia (turns out Covid can cause symptoms like preeclampsia so they treated it the same.) They didn't tell me it could suppress milk supply. It should have been one hour of the stuff would suppress it an extra day.\n\nI was on it for 3 days. They just kept saying it would be fine. My milk would come in. I just needed to do every other feeding trying to nurse.\n\nMy poor baby would go to sleep with just a little bit of milk dribbling out of her mouth. It seemed like everything was fine.\n\nShe was underweight at her 1 week. Pediatrician was enraged when I told her the doctors, nurses, and lactation consultant said to just keep trying.\n\nI completely switched her to formula, but she did like to comfort nurse. Still got that closeness.\n\nFed is best. If you can't breastfeed for any reason, you can formula feed. It's not the devil.", "Couldn\u2019t agree more!", "You and the mum did the right thing moving to formula when the baby wasn't gaining weight, but it is actually normal for a breastfed baby to wake more often than a formula fed one. Especially in early evening, they \"cluster feed\" and will barely be down for 15 minutes sometimes... It's normal, if annoying and stressful.", "It's because all those studies that always said \"breastfeeding is always best for the baby!!1!!1!\" completely neglected to control for the wealth and ability to stay-at-home with no cares for financial worries of the BF parent. \n\nBreastmilk has some positive properties, but imo they are completely overshadowed by the actual impacts of financial success and resources a parent actually had prior to giving birth.", "This.\n\nI was in an in-between position; able to breastfeed but not enough, so my son was a half-and-half baby (who didn't seem to have a preference.)  I was not too impacted emotionally but was hyper-aware of being sure he got enough nutrients.  He is 14 now and very healthy; so, really, there are many ways to go about this.", "Oh my god you\u2019re BOTH right ffs. The sister shouldn\u2019t have freaked out mom that way at all, no it\u2019s not okay to do that, but the mother is also being extremely unhealthy and she needs help right fucking NOW.\n\nWhen someone else is staying in the house with you and your baby, generally the first reaction to the baby being outside of the room is NOT to have a complete meltdown. It\u2019s to check to see if the other person has taken the baby for a while. \n\nAgain, not saying the sister was right for taking the baby. But the mothers reaction shows how much help she needs. It\u2019s NOT NORMAL.", "Which is why the fact that it's apparently some sort of official term is *infuriating* to me. Like...did you people learn *nothing* from Andrea Yates and similar cases? Treating moms like fucking childcare robots is a good way to end up with dead kids.", "But that's the thing, babies are inherently not independent. You really can't call yourself \"baby friendly\" if you don't care about the health and welfare of mom *as a person*, not just as an incubator/milk dispenser/diaper changer. Reducing women to their body parts and how those body parts can take care of the child and nothing else is how you end up with the next Andrea Yates.", "As a pediatric nurse for years, he was out of line and should have at least had a lactation consult & also what formula (if he hadn\u2019t) would be best to start the baby on. Also, the baby could have had stomach issues or other possible explanations which he should have checked instead of going straight to calling CPS.", "A nourished baby is a contented, healthy baby. The kind of food has no negative effects."]}
