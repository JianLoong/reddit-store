You were in a public space with a dance floor and music came on. Unsolicited advice, but please consider if you should go through with a wedding. I dated a girl from a highly Baptist-Conservative family for 6 years. Every day was a struggle in our relationship. They hated me because I was showing her what the world was actually like and helping her come out of her shell and question her beliefs. They were constantly whispering in her ear and trying to break up our relationship. This is how it will be with your fianc\u00e9. I know it seems like he's come a long way, but his family will ALWAYS be there to undo any progress you have made to turn him into a normal human being who actually cares about other people. Every day will be a new battle with his family and unfortunately, you will be all alone in this fight. \n\nHis family will always push him to force their beliefs on your marriage and any children you have together. Unfortunately I have experience in this as well, but with my own family. Nobody in my family is particularly religious, but they do have some backasswards beliefs. My father molested my sisters growing up. One of them spoke up about it. Instead of believing her, everyone treated her like a problem child and made life worse for her. She was constantly trying to run away or get anyone to listen, and she was constantly punished for it. They sent her to a \"teen ranch\" to try to fix her, constantly berated her, and when she was finally old enough to get away, they cut all contact with her and she has lived a difficult life because of it. I didn't learn about all of this until recently and I hate myself for not being a better little brother, but we have slowly begun repairing our relationship. But when she tried to reach out to our grandparents because she wanted her daughter to have a relationship with them, my grandmother screamed at her to stay out of their lives and she won't get \"caught up in her lies\" anymore. When I confronted my grandmother about his, she countered me with \"family doesn't abandon each other. She abandoned us when she left, she never reached out to us for help.\" Now I ask you: do you want any children you might have in the future to go through this? Because I guarantee you, any child you have that goes against your husband's family's standards will be ostracized, ridiculed, and abused. That's just how these kind of people are. Are you prepared to go through something like this? Are you willing to tell them to fuck off every time they bring something up with your husband NEVER backing you up? Are you prepared to just be a \"wife\" who shuts up and does what she is told? If not, then you should not go through with this marriage.

You grew up without too much restrictions and it is your free choice to give up some habits or some ways to dress if you think he is worth it. \n\nBut probably your children, especially girls, will not e\nhave the chance to make this decision themselves but will have to endure restrictions and misogynostic indoctrination as they grow up! \n\nI think you should sit your fiance down and tell him that you want to be as you are and your future children to grow up as you grew up. If he is not on board with that, remember him that he fell in love with you because you are the one you are. Ask him if he really would like you to be different. If so, better do not marry him.", "Forget LBTQ, this fianc\u00e9 will be the type of dad who rejects his son for joining science club instead of the football team.", "Hello, fellow former evangelical! \n\nAs you know, it is difficult to make that break, and I'm not clear how much OP himself has been trying to break out of the way he grew up or if it's just the family that concerns him. I am only around my family for special occassions, and while I vehemently disagree with them, I'm willing to alter my behavior some (not drinking, toning down my language) because I know it makes them truly uncomfortable. I think OP needs to decide if she's willing to do that or where the line is. I wouldn't avoid dancing in a public place where dancing is expected, however. Of course, we wouldn't be at a bar because they believe drinking alcohol is sinful.", "Bot", "It literally is.", "Or a child that is gay/trans/nonbinary.", "At a Supreme Court level sure. But I used to work with an orthodox non Christian community for a few years and they would behave exactly like this.", "Hasidic Jews don't even allow women and men to dance together at weddings. They can't even been able to see one another. They're separated by a sheet.", "Jews actually do depending on where you are.  I believe there's even a town in New Jersey that is majority Jewish where they try and enforce their beliefs on the schooling system.\n\nPeople are people, no matter the religion.", "My guy we are talking about conservative here. And the issue is them trying to take away her ability to do something completely harmless, dancing, Vs their right to what? Not see her dancing?", "But he\u2019s now on board with evolution! Totally open minded.", "What are the odds that OP and Fiance have actually had an in-depth conversation on how they see their marriage? Both want kids? If so, what's expected in displine and raising them? Will he raise them religious, like his parents did him? Will you join your finances or keep them separate? \n\nBefore getting married, you need to have hard conversations to make sure you're actually compatible in how you both see your future.", "That\u2019s actually a really helpful framing. I\u2019ll keep that in mind thank you.", ">You were dancing, not broadcasting porn, ffs. NTA.\n\nFor those people, it's pretty much the same thing.", "Yeah, unless she was doing the Stan Smith \"Get Low\" dance, his family sound like sour, judgemental Puritans.

After some back and forth he did acknowledge this. I believe there\u2019s a bible verse about wife being your family first above your other family but could not find it.", "This seems like hardly anything to be measured as progress. He's living in the 1800s.", "We have had many discussions. I am on board for having us all go to church, but that they are also exposed to other cultures and religions and free to choose their own paths. I like the community element of it and obviously I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to marry him if he wasn\u2019t a kind generous person, as are his family.", "She is the one here for advice. So she is getting advice.", "Yeah, no. I meant literally.\n\nAlso, I am not in a cult considering the fact that I am not in any religion.", "If you focus exclusively on the United States sure.", "Right that\u2019s fine for them to choose to live like that. It\u2019s when they get mad at other people for not following their rules I take issue with. Also regarding my soul, I\u2019m sure in your book I\u2019m headed for hell so I\u2019m not too worried about it.", "There are also Bible verses about the wife submitting to her husband... be careful OP!", "Dude you don\u2019t want any of this. I highly suggest secular couples counselling before you even think of going ahead with any kind of wedding. I grew up like him and you are not going to like where this is going. Just wait. All that nicey pie from his family goes away every time you \u201cstep out of line\u201d until one day they have \u201cprayer meeting\u201d and you learn that everything you say and do alone with your husband is open, much-discussed public knowledge and always has been.

Good luck.", "You keep saying these people are kind and generous.  These people are not kind.  They shamed you at your own bachelorette party.  This is not kind behavior.  I bet they are anything but kind to people who do not agree with them.  They are not kind to people who want abortions, and I doubt they\u2019re very kind to queer folks.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry, I think you are delusional if you think his family is kind and generous.\n\nNTA for this situation, but def YTA for lying to yourself about how hateful his family is.", "Do not agree to go to the church that his family attends. May wish to check out the Unitarians.", "You are OK with going to a church that is against dancing, gays, music, etc? \n\nYou are very naive. There's no community. There is only control and religion is a way of control. Come on! They left horrified because you were dancing with your sister.", "What are his takes on gay rights?  If you have any future kids, there is always the possibility that your kids could be gay.  Or trans.  How is he going to handle this?  As a dad, and with his family?  This is something that my spouse and I just... never thought to talk about.  Fast-forward and the queer kids outnumber the straight kids in our house.  Fortunately our values are pretty much the same, but it has impacted his relationship with some family members to the point of no contact.  It honestly blew my mind that I didn't know his feelings until we were there... because if he hadn't been 100% willing to accept and back our kids and be firm with his family, it would have ended our marriage.  It would have HAD to end because the kids are first and they have to be safe, loved, and accepted 100% in their own home.  Just food for thought here about this potential scenario because I think people tend to not consider it until it happens.", "That's not how it works and shows how poorly understanding you are of what a cult is and makes a cult a cult.", "Even when you dont focus on the United States its still Christians doing more than all the others combined. Unless you're one of the weirdos that think catholics arent Christian.", "You have a poor self image, my condolences.", "There is a bible verse for everything.

I\u2019ll stay enjoying myself instead of trying to appease sky daddy.", "My mom lived through it too. Footloose and Dirty Dancing are some of her all-time favorite movies, and there\u2019s a *reason*: She went to a Baptist middle school that didn\u2019t allow school dances, and made the girls wear a skirt or dress to school every day. She *hated* it.\n\n(Luckily, her parents sent her to public high school after that, so my mom got to wear jeans to class, go to her senior prom, and has known every word to \u201cGirls Girls Girls\u201d since 1987.)", "id imagine it is very when people think its fake xD", "You want to believe you are some type of good and moral person but you can't even respect difference in beliefs. \n\nIt tells a LOT about you, more than you realize.
