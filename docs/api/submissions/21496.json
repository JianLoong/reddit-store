They say you were not considerate of their values, but were they considerate of yours? Also, they just stormed out.

He may claim he is more moderate in his views, but at his core I suspect this is not so and that over years he will gravitate back into the mindset of how he was raised.  For him to not support your freedom to dance and basically side against you is a huge RED flag.  Please do not miss it.

(Assuming you were just dancing and not twerking or something) Even if he felt embarrassed, I don't like that he said that to you as if you have the issue.

He's reacted this way to you dancing at a party. Wear a skirt above the ankles to a family event, not becoming of a married woman. Is he going to be on board with you thinking for yourself? Will he demand full control over all finances and push you to be totally dependent so he doesn't embarrass himself as not being the patriarch of the family? \n\nI've seen this type of situation a lot over my many decades. The guy acts oh so open minded compared to his conservative family. Then the marriage and that goes straight out the window before the ink is dry on the marriage license. I would encourage you to step back, think real hard on his behaviors without the goggles of love filtering it and decide is this a great idea.", "The bigger issue is that your soon-to-be-husband validated their feelings by storming off.
