You were in a public space with a dance floor and music came on. Unsolicited advice, but please consider if you should go through with a wedding. I dated a girl from a highly Baptist-Conservative family for 6 years. Every day was a struggle in our relationship. They hated me because I was showing her what the world was actually like and helping her come out of her shell and question her beliefs. They were constantly whispering in her ear and trying to break up our relationship. This is how it will be with your fianc\u00e9. I know it seems like he's come a long way, but his family will ALWAYS be there to undo any progress you have made to turn him into a normal human being who actually cares about other people. Every day will be a new battle with his family and unfortunately, you will be all alone in this fight. \n\nHis family will always push him to force their beliefs on your marriage and any children you have together. Unfortunately I have experience in this as well, but with my own family. Nobody in my family is particularly religious, but they do have some backasswards beliefs. My father molested my sisters growing up. One of them spoke up about it. Instead of believing her, everyone treated her like a problem child and made life worse for her. She was constantly trying to run away or get anyone to listen, and she was constantly punished for it. They sent her to a \"teen ranch\" to try to fix her, constantly berated her, and when she was finally old enough to get away, they cut all contact with her and she has lived a difficult life because of it. I didn't learn about all of this until recently and I hate myself for not being a better little brother, but we have slowly begun repairing our relationship. But when she tried to reach out to our grandparents because she wanted her daughter to have a relationship with them, my grandmother screamed at her to stay out of their lives and she won't get \"caught up in her lies\" anymore. When I confronted my grandmother about his, she countered me with \"family doesn't abandon each other. She abandoned us when she left, she never reached out to us for help.\" Now I ask you: do you want any children you might have in the future to go through this? Because I guarantee you, any child you have that goes against your husband's family's standards will be ostracized, ridiculed, and abused. That's just how these kind of people are. Are you prepared to go through something like this? Are you willing to tell them to fuck off every time they bring something up with your husband NEVER backing you up? Are you prepared to just be a \"wife\" who shuts up and does what she is told? If not, then you should not go through with this marriage.
