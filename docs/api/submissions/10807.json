She spends more time with her aunt than with my fiance during the day and sleeps over with her aunt at least three nights a week but now it's closer to 5 after my kids and I moved in. \n\nShe's also been pretty cold towards me and my kids. My fiance says she just needs some time and that she's having trouble adjusting but I swear she's moving in with her aunt. I saw her drag 2 suitcases and a duffel bag to her aunt's house.

I reminded him that this would be temporary, just until we find a house big enough for all of us, but he's refusing. I tried to tell him that this doesn't look good to any of the kids, his boys have half a room and my kids don't even have a room while she has 2 to herself.

Besides, you can tell she doesn\u2019t like the daughter. She stated that she\u2019s using her trauma to manipulate her father. She gives off evil stepmother vibes.", "But OP's soon to be step-daughter needs the living situation to stay as is for her wellbeing. So OP's suggestion would only stop resentment from *her* children but not his. He's right to advocate for his daughter in this circumstance.\n\nThis should have been hashed out properly before OP and her kids came to stay with them. This isn't an official moving in, it's a response to OP's living crisis. It's not that the fiance's house has become their shared house. It's still his and his families and essentially OP and her kids are guests.\n\nIf she and her fianc\u00e9 had discussed this beforehand and were still unable to come to an agreement then she should have found alternative living arrangements. If this is literally her only option then unfortunately she and her kids will have to deal with it.", "At this point, I'm not sure if it will get to that. Sharing 2 bedrooms between five kids is a bit much. Unfortunately due to OP's circumstances, it seems like all of this was rushed and not well planned out. If he doesn't have the space, he doesn't have the space. There isn't anything he can do.  He has to take his daughter into account first.", "Because forcing another child to LEAAVE HER HOME so that other kids can move into HER HOME won't breed resentment? What an absolutely garbage argument.", "Likely not for long if OP keeps trying to kick the daughter out of the house.", "Lots of people are. That's why they're fiances for 5 years before they break up.", "Then all rooms on that side of the duplex are off limits for you to have opinions about their use.", "You ignore the more important point: you need to reevaluate your relationship with this person if this is how you want to treat his child. With all your negativity toward her, why marry him? Because otherwise, you\u2019ll be homeless?\n\nSounds like you need to move in with relatives and get a job.", "then find a place to live that you can afford.\n\nHis daughter should not be displaced to house your kids.\n\nIf you value his kids less than your own kids, you're not ready to get married.", "You can\u2019t even keep a roof over your children\u2019s heads - they\u2019re not homeless thanks to him. I\u2019d call that fairly generous, a bunk bed in the dining room sounds way better than what you can provide - a cardboard bed on the sidewalk. You\u2019ve got some nerve OP, and obviously, YTA.", "Her aunts house is not her home!!! How is that so hard to understand?! If your kids had a room at their grandparents house hours away would you say they had two bedrooms?! Absolutely not! Lol What is wrong with you? I hope your fianc\u00e9 dumps you for trying to split up his family. You deserve nothing less.", "How is that his daughter fault? Why should she give up her space because your incapable of providing for your kids.", "You either need to make more money or move somewhere less expensive; it's not up to your bf to \"save you\" by kicking his daughter out. He put a roof over your head, and you should just be grateful that you and your daughters aren't staying in a homeless shelter. Is your living situation perfect? No, but it beats the alternative.", "That\u2019s your problem. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s fault you have failed to provide for your kids. His charity is allowing you to move in. Do better for your kids and stop demanding things.", "And that\u2019s YOUR problem. You not being able to provide for your kids does not mean his kids should lose out.", "[removed]", "I am certain that there are places you can rent, other than the one you just moved from.  They may not be ideal but it is not plausible that where you lived previously was the ONLY place you could afford.\n\nIf thats true, which i highly doubt, then it is very puzzling that you are being so demanding and showing no empathy for his daughter, which will undoubtedly  cause your fiance' to take drastic measures.  \n\nObviously your kids being in the dining room isnt ideal. But is being homeless ideal?  According to you that is the alternative.  The duplex is too small to reasonably accommodate 3 more people   i agree your bf shouldnt displace his daughter.  Why should she pay the price for your poor financial state?  If anyone should be uncomfortable, it should be you, not his daughter.  So why not be thankful that you are not homeless and work towards finding a better place for everyone or for you and your kids", "Why should the dad force his daughter to share a room with children 5+ years younger than her.", "So he didn\u2019t say he would just kick you out and make you homeless. Way to completely avoid the actual question. YTA", "He refuses to make any changes to his house for my kids beyond putting up a curtain in the dining room.", "As is his right... in HIS effing house that he provides for HIS kids. Just because you failed to provide for yours you think he should throw out his own? I hope he leaves you and tosses you out.", "Because adults need more privacy than children.", "It is not a good time to go house hunting for sure.", "So you're not and won't contribute is what I'm hearing.", "Exactly, and planning to move in together anyway. Also people seem to judge her for not affording her rent anymore, as if that somehow automatically makes her a bad mother. Like it's a crime to be poor! \n\nThe cost of living has risen considerably in the last couple of years, a lot of families are struggling when they have two working parents let alone a single mom.", "Oh sweetie, yet you felt the need to comment. The woman acted like a monster, she gets called out for being a monster simple. You don\u2019t like it, ignore the post.

There\u2019s no way they are engaged with kids and not living together.", "Then you're both AHs for even getting into this with no clear plan on how to get out of it. His daughter shouldn't have to uproot her life just because you two adults can't agree on how to proceed with this slapdash arrangement.", "Is that even remotely feasible? How many years would that take you while renting, even if it was only a one bedroom in a shitty neighborhood?", "YTA He already knows that you won\u2019t. Next person to move out will be you!", "Where's her kids dad? Like why can't he take them?", "Sure, but OP\u2019s kids are literally in the living room with no personal space of their own\u2026 so what about their well-being?  Don\u2019t they have trauma from their parents divorce too?  His daughter has two rooms to herself in the same building.  He asked OP to marry him, but he\u2019s showing that he will treat their kids preferentially and prioritize his own daughters\u2019 comfort over hers.  I get that he owns the duplex and can set the rules, but asking someone to marry you and then treating their kids as less important than your own is an AH move.  I don\u2019t think OP standing up for her kid\u2019s well-being makes her TAH.  If he didn\u2019t want her kids to be a part of his family, he shouldn\u2019t have asked her to marry him.  And if they are going to be a part of his family, then he should care about their needs just as much as his bio daughters\u2019.", "When they do get married, wouldn\u2019t they all be his daughters?  Or do you think the bio daughter should always be first priority and treated better than the other kids?  If he\u2019s not willing to incorporate her kids into his family and treat and love them equally, he shouldn\u2019t marry someone that has kids.", "I\u2019m full on team YTA for op but they did say this was an emergency situation and that finding a newer/bigger place had already been a plan/in motion.", "He doesn't pay rent and his mortgage is paid off. He can afford a place but he wants me to pay for at lest 30%, which I will not be able to do.", "I want to move all of us into a bigger house but he wants me and the kids to find another place and keep saving for the house.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The room isn\u2019t even being used as a dining room. It\u2019s just a room with no door at this point. If you and OP feel that it\u2019s not a big deal for the daughter to live with her aunt temporarily then it\u2019s really not a big deal for OP\u2019s kids to deal with having a bedroom with no door. The daughter doesn\u2019t have two rooms. She has one room that belongs to her. The other room belongs to her aunt so OP has no right to make any plans that involve it.", "because she truly only has one room. The one at her aunt isnt really hers.", "Thank you for your opinion but I know what's best for my family better than some stranger on the internet.", "I don't think broaching the subject makes her an AH, although I think they both are for not discussing fully the arrangements before OP and her daughters moved in. However, pushing it once she's been given an answer and having expectations in a house that isn't hers pushes her into AH territory imo.\n\nAnd personally, at this point I don't think that he should be caring about her daughters needs equally. Yes they are engaged but their families aren't blended yet. With the best will in the world sometimes families just do not blend because of competing needs and I think it's right that at this stage both partners (whilst having compassion for their potential step children) look out for and advocate for their own children. That doesn't make either of them assholes but it also doesn't mean that they should be looking to make this work at any or all costs.\n\nPersonally I wouldn't get engaged to a partner before our families had blended successfully because that's a crucial part of sharing your future lives together.", "That's fair. But shouldn't she have talked to him about this before moving in?\n\nIt sounds like they are now 5 people living in a 2 bedroom apartment. That's really tough. That's a bad situation. There's no solution that isn't rough on most of the participants. I think OP and her fiance are still TA, though, because if you've got kids then yeah getting married means a blended family, and the kids have to come first, so why aren't the adults the ones living in the living room while her daughters share the master bedroom and his daughter keeps her room?", "Of course bio daughter will take priority. And she should.", "I mean, yeah, I know, and wasn't saying otherwise. Only that *this* move was handled badly, and the fallout from their poor handling revealed problems in their family dynamic that will not be solved by everyone moving into a bigger place together.\n\nBoth parents knew the townhouse would be too small, but instead of having a 20min conversation with each other to agree on a plan for these temporary arrangements before moving the kids in, OP assumed one thing, fiance assumed another, and they ended up with two kids unexpectedly finding themselves roomless, and another trying to ghost her way out of the house. Disagreements over this have escalated to OP trying to kick out his daughter and fiance threatening to kick out OP & kids. \n\nSo I'm not telling OP to get a bigger house, I'm telling them their family is not behaving like one that is ready to cohabit in the first place.", "What so you spent your money on? Why can't you save if you don't even pay rent?", "How exactly are you contributing to this? I hear a lot of demands from you but nothing that you bring to the table", "You know what has even less privacy than a dining room? A homeless shelter\n\nRental costs are crazy high and it sucks that landlord doubled the rent, but what would OP have done if she didn\u2019t have a fianc\u00e9? Would OP have gotten a place too small for them and managed? Would OP have moved out of the city? Would OP have stayed in the old place and gotten another job to cover rent? How hard has OP looked for a new place? \n\nIt sounds like OP and fianc\u00e9 are not ready to blend their families. Instead of pushing to move the daughter out, OP should be spending time finding a new place for her family as it seems clear the fianc\u00e9 views her and her children\u2019s stay in his home as temporary.", "So why are you posting here asking for - checks notes - the opinions of some strangers on the internet? Lol YTA and a choosy beggar, not a great combo tbh", "My \"opinion\" happens to be an article from a reputable journalist which cites a variety of scientific studies. \n\nBut, by all means, you do you.", "Sure, but it\u2019s next to impossible to blend a family when there is blatant favoritism.  If they actually do want to blend their families as an objective, then OP\u2019s request is pretty reasonable.  If he wants OP\u2019s kids to see him as a parent when they get married, he shouldn\u2019t prioritize his kid having two rooms to herself while her prospective sisters sleep in the living room.  And if he doesn\u2019t want her kids to see him as a parent, he\u2019s TA for asking her to marry him in the first place.  I think it is a very AH move to have a bio kid and an adopted kid, and then treat the bio kid significantly better.  If you can\u2019t treat your adopted kids equally and fairly, then you shouldn\u2019t bring them into your family.  \u201cI want you to marry me, but my kids will always be more important than yours,\u201d is a total AH position to take.", "I totally agree with you.  If they were both good parents, they would be in the living room for the time being while they work on getting more space.", "Then don't get married again to a person with kids. To say that his daughter should always get preferential treatment is beyond ridiculous. If he actually plans on marrying this girl that is. Doesn't sound like he's taking it very seriously to me.", "So you think bio kids should be treated better than adopted kids because they don\u2019t have their parents\u2019 DNA?", "Because she isn't contributing lmao every time someone asks what she brings to the table suddenly she stops responding in that thread. Because all she's contributing is her hands out for handouts.", "Not always. Just at this stage. Until they've successfully blended and know that this will work. And he's not prioritising his daughter \"having 2 rooms to herself whilst her prospective sisters sleep in the living room\" it's allowing her to keep her own room in her own house because that's what she needs for her wellbeing. Otherwise, he risks both her mental health and permanent damage to their relationship.\n\nTo reframe this, imagine it wasn't the sister next door, imagine it was the daughter's bio mum. And when OP moved in, she suggested that the daughter give up her room and stay at with her mum full time so that her daughters could have a room. That would be inappropriate. The fact that she is spending so much time out of her room is likely a symptom of the fact that she is also struggling with this arrangement and she may feel like she has to spend more time elsewhere.\n\nI'm not suggesting that OP's kids are being princesses, or that it can't be hard to live in someone's dining room. The whole situation is difficult and the real AH here is the cost of living crisis. But asking OP's partner to give up his daughter's own bedroom is asking him to prioritise *her* children over *his*. The daughter giving up her room is not compromising, it's forcing her out.\n\nIf they really want this to work and find a way around it why don't they give the kids the master bedroom and they sleep in the dining room on an airbed?", "He saved them from homelessness. What is he supposed to do? Magically make a room appear? By putting her kids in their he is prioritizing her kids over her own.", "They aren\u2019t adopted. Adopted would make them legally his. They aren\u2019t his kids, they are hers. So until they are legally his, yes, daughter should be treated as a priority"]}
