To which made me say \"so how Mary would feel coming here?\" he only laughed and said it was different, and good luck convincing my mother Sally (48F). Well I had this big fight with Sally and she claimed she had no idea Mary and I planned on moving, even though I talked to her a few times prior without any issue.

Mary told me she was calling the cops because my father and I have a history of altercations. As I was on the phone my sister screamed to open the door and proceeded to kick it more. I told Mary I would handle it and got off the phone. It was my mother and sister trying to \"talk\" to me. My mother said she did nothing wrong and my sister told me to grow some man parts and listen. I got louder and told them to leave. My sister began to say all sorts of things about me, Mary, you name it, and I of course said some not so nice things.
