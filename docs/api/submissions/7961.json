However after I graduated university and came back, my parents have elected to smash one of my monitors, cut my ethernet cord and now physically taken my PC due to arguments over my gaming habits. After work I come home and play games until I sleep, and over on the weekends I play games the entire day. \n\nIt has been going on since two weeks ago, and they are refusing to give back my PC even though my psychologist says that this is doing more harm than anything. They call me childish for not being able to control my own habits despite the fact that I am holding my own job. This has caused me to become more depressed than usual, with my days now often spent 95% of the time with me in bed aimlessly scrolling through social media. I am back on my antidepressants, and they seem to think that this is the better alternative.

Gaming is a pasttime like any hobby, it is not drugs or alcohol, much less gambling.\n\nNo one tells an athlete they are doing too much of their sport. It's a double standard and the psychiatric industry now has begun to recognize this. My son was inpatient at one of the best places in the US for a month (has a storied history of cutting edge psych research). The staff, including his psychiatrist, determined his addiction was not a disorder and he was functional and we should support him instead of trying to \"fix\" him b/c we didn't understand his love of gaming. He's now 23, great job and pay (better than most his age), just got his first dog, and loves his life. He still games in most of his off time as do most of his friends. Sometimes we game with him. It's his hobby and he can have as much of it as he wants so long as it's not causing him financial or emotional distress. Period. It's his life.\n\nIf you think about it, we call someone this focused a prodigy usually. Think piano players, singers, artists, and anyone else who loves a particular activity and can't get tired of it/dedicates all or most of their free time to it. It's all about perspective and the world is realizing this finally. I paint a lot (watercolor) and love it. It's meditative and I'd rather paint than socialize most of the time.
