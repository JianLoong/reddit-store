He's now 23, great job and pay (better than most his age), just got his first dog, and loves his life. He still games in most of his off time as do most of his friends. Sometimes we game with him.

My next suggestion would be to sit down with your parents and set some ground rules. Would you be willing to have the computer in just a common area and to agree to curfews on your computer and phone? Can you agree to only play non-monetary games with your friends, such as Magic or Dungeons & Dragons or something else? Can you read a book while falling asleep rather than scrolling, or perhaps write in a journal? In the states we have groups on [Meetup.com](https://Meetup.com) where you can find other people interested in simple hobbies from hiking to writing to painting and theater. Would you agree to take a few uni classes as a way of filling your time or create a gym schedule with no phone? I have compulsive behaviors and found long walks with no phone helped me, but my health doesn't allow me to walk long distances anymore, so I turn off my phone and keep it off unless I need to take a break and check my messages. \n\nAs for rent, you should tell them to replace or repair your broken items or deduct it from the rent.

She has a job, sleeps, and has a lot of close friends but she's still an alcoholic that drinks a lot", "OP is 22. Her parents aren't boomers, they're Gen X at the oldest and should know actual details of games. I know we use Boomer as an insult for out of touch loons, but in this case its kind of giving them an out for not understanding. Her parents are probably about my age and I grew up with games too. Tomb Raider, Quake, etc all came out in my 20s", "Her games were her only form of being social- by cutting that off entirely they are actively making her depression symptoms worse by isolating her further. And doing it in such a violent manner certainly doesn\u2019t help. This is probably one of the reasons why her psych is against doing this. The parents have cause for concern but that doesn\u2019t mean they have the knowledge to act on that concern in a beneficial way.", "Exactly. In 5 years if she wants to start a family how will this addiction play out? 22 is time to grow up, start cooking and cleaning and doing laundry, helping with hard work around the house (mowing lawns whatever!). No matter her gender, a household needs contributions and 22 is definitely old enough for that contribution. \n\nBack in the olden days people started families at 18yo. I know times have changed but sitting around playing video games at 22 (when it\u2019s ALL weekend, like stated in the post) needs to be addressed.", "They changed the title of key people in the scenario given by OP. And not even unreasonable ones. \n\nParents are changed to landlord, because in this case the parents act as landlord too. \n\nThe parents DID destroy OP's possesions and steal some of the still intact ones. Which they did in their roles as parents\n\nAnd the parents DO still expect OP to pay rent. Which they do in their roles as landlord.\n\nDifferent caps, still the same people.", "They didn\u2019t completely change the scenario to fit their argument. When you pay someone a value for a place to live, they are your landlord. OPs landlord happens to ALSO be their parents.", "Your landlord may impose any rules they want for their property. It is your choice whether or not you want to live there. To be clear, I don\u2019t agree with how the parents are handling this situation. That being said, her best option is to move out.", ">It is not good advice to say anything than; consult your state tenancy laws and support groups because your position is entirely dependant on that.\n\nExactly this.", "You are confidently incorrect, yes.  You're using concepts from the big book (or whatever it's called) from the 1930s, which are extremely outdated and harmful.  We have decades of research into the neurochemistry, psychology, and social factors of use disorders now.  We even have tests to score the severity+category (impaired control, physical dependence, social problems and risky use) disorder with different treatment modalities.\n\nAddiction is [substance use disorder](https://www.tpoftampa.com/why-we-use-the-term-substance-use-disorder-instead-of-substance-abuse/).  Part of being a disorder is that it causes an impairment in daily life or significant/noticeable distress to the person using.  This was updated in the DSM-5 in *2013*.  \n\nA person who habitually uses substances (or behaviors like gaming, gambling, etc) who is still able to fully participate in life and isn't upset over their use (or the repercussions of their use) is not disordered.  They are not \"functioning addicts\" because they're not addicts.", "Agreed. Depression is potentially very dangerous to health and can be fatal."]}
