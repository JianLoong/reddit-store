He's now 23, great job and pay (better than most his age), just got his first dog, and loves his life. He still games in most of his off time as do most of his friends. Sometimes we game with him.

My next suggestion would be to sit down with your parents and set some ground rules. Would you be willing to have the computer in just a common area and to agree to curfews on your computer and phone? Can you agree to only play non-monetary games with your friends, such as Magic or Dungeons & Dragons or something else? Can you read a book while falling asleep rather than scrolling, or perhaps write in a journal?

As my therapist has related in our conversations, most of these claims at \"addictions \" when broken down end up being isolated or disabled folks using computers and games to interact and have friends that they wouldn't be able to maintain in person. usually true gaming addictions come with some element of harm, such as compulsive loot box or premium currency purchase, or even as simple as not eating/drinking/taking care of hygene in lieu of gaming, much like a gambling addiction, its not just \" I spend my FreeTime playing games on the computer til I go to bed.\" \n\nI would actually want to ask the op to consider getting another opinion from another mental healthcare professional about this as an \"addiction\" if they are not ommiting their own destructive issues, and it is as discribed(Gaming as an outlet for interacting with friends you have that may be online only) as this sometimes is a hallmark sign, especially with limited hobbies or interests, in undiagnosed Autism. Gaming Addiction is also very much an open debate in the medical community at the level op is describing(100% functional and as a method of social interaction)", "nope, that's how you get sued and/or evicted", "Honest question do you think she is really taking care of all other responsibilities? Like help around the house for instance? I doubt it.", "I do wonder about that. She didn't really say what she and her psychologist are doing about her addiction, but I thought that with most addictions the goal is to eliminate that substance or activity form your life (obviously that's not possible with food, and maybe not feasible for shopping, sex, and some other addictions either). \n\nBut I'm not a psychologist and if hers says it's best for her to continue playing video games, they probably know more than I do. I can see her parents being concerned when she's been diagnosed with a gaming addiction and she continues to spend every spare minute gaming. Just being able to hold down a job doesn't make that ok.\n\nBut, the way the parents are handling this is ridiculous and out of line. I wouldn't want to pay rent to people who are destroying or taking my things either. But how OP is addressing/failing to address her addiction would determine to me whether it's E S H or N T A.", "I don\u2019t know, could you ask her?", "What?", "100%. As someone who also used to live with a gaming addicted brother, I feel like there is info missing. He would become agitated and volatile if you even suggested he had a problem or needed to stop playing. There were multiple times my parents and I would have to lock ourselves in their room at night because we were worried he'd get a gun or hurt us. (Edit, or hurt himself) It was not a fun environment to live in for the several years I had to live through it. \n\nHe'd game all night (it was the worst to sleep through), sleep all day, miss work frequently, and he was an asshole to anyone and everyone. He was also really good at manipulating people.\n\nI don't think the parents are right to destroy OPs things. But I just feel like there is more that is being left out.", "They say \u201cafter work I come home\u201d so it\u2019s reasonable to assume they\u2019re going somewhere.", "Exactly. I'm 50yo and have seen this over and over. The vast majority of ppl with what some perceive as \"gaming addiction\" follow a very similar path to yours. So glad you listened to your gut and got out of a mentally unhealthy place!", "Sure, but that's done through kicking her out, not smashing her belongings.", "You are completely wrong.  There are other areas where loss of functioning applies, it\u2019s not just work or school. Significant social or emotional stress also applies.  Plenty of people maintain jobs that have a diagnosed addiction.  Since OP never leaves her room outside of work and just plays games all day I guarantee her addiction has significantly impaired her personal relationships and caused a lot of strife at home.  I think she\u2019s intentionally leaving out info to make her parents look bad.", "I think this is getting lost in the weeds way too much with a lot of hypotheticals and semantics. Let's keep it simple because I do see your point.\n\nOP: \"It has been going on since two weeks ago, and they are refusing to give back my PC even though my psychologist says that this is doing more harm than anything. They call me childish for not being able to control my own habits despite the fact that I am holding my own job. This has caused me to become more depressed than usual, with my days now often spent 95% of the time with me in bed aimlessly scrolling through social media. I am back on my antidepressants, and they seem to think that this is the better alternative. I have voiced this opinion countless times but they refuse to listen to me or my psychologist (and I have a letter written from them).\"\n\nWhat I read her saying in this is that 1. She wants her PC back and she is entitled to her PC (she's 23, how in the world is this okay for anyone to steal the PC from another adult?) 2. She feels she is controlling her own habits fine at this time as she's holding her own job - she's met her own internal goal for herself (makes it probably not a diagnosable disorder actually) 3. This has triggered more depression than her normal baseline so much she's back on antidepressants (which implies she'd gotten off them, which is a healthy sign she was doing well) 4. She has voiced her opinion clearly, which aligns with her psychologist's opinion and the parents are ignoring them both.\n\nI am not hypothesizing or predicting or projecting what may or may not happen to OP. I am keeping my analysis to exactly what OP reported clearly. Almost no one spends their entire life solely hyperfocused on gaming. Most find love and other life pursuits along the way, and naturally find a bit more balance, though that's subjective.\n\nVideo gaming is like TV back in the day. Everyone said humanity would be ruined by TV. Excessive TV watching is actually no longer in the DSM. People still do it. Binge watching Netflix for instance. But it's not a diagnosable disorder because it's been culturally normalized.\n\nWe're learning a lot of our expectations we place on other people's behavior is tainted by what we perceive as normal/abnormal due to cultural conditioning. But we live in a world where we are inevitably headed to a singularity and where human and machines will inevitably become one. Virtual and physical worlds will become indistinguishable. Hell, many scientists believe we're probably living in a simulation already. There is a place in our world for those who truly love video gaming. We should welcome them. They probably hold one of the keys to our evolutionary future and we don't even know it. It's her free time. Let her be free. It's that simple.\n\nSome highly interesting data on zoomers and gaming benefits:[https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/gen-z-teens-gaming.html](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/technology/gen-z-teens-gaming.html)\n\nThere are gaming tournaments (in person) and of course, Twitch and other streaming platforms normalizing gaming and e-sports. Different types of games also create various social interactions, creative expressions, and ways of thinking about physics. There is a lot of interesting and constructive stuff coming out of the gaming world. In 100 years, people looking back on our pathologizing of this might have a good laugh. ;)", "Just because you have a broken appliance in an apartment it doesn't mean you can just not pay your rent.", "She has depression. People with depression generally don't have the motivation to do things and doesn't find joy in things they should or usually would. And she says gaming is how she socializes. They're probably prioritizing the depression in therapy and taking away her means of talking to her friends online isn't going to help. It would be like when I told my dad I had anxiety and he said he'd lock me in my room forever and take away all my games and my phone so I wouldn't have anything to be anxious about. \n\nAlso there is never an excuse to destroy someone's property. I highly doubt law enforcement would take \"She's addicted to games, we were just trying to help.\" As a good excuse.", "Are they keeping other obligations arou d the house? Buying groceries, shopping, chores?", "I honestly just totally disagree with you. OP has literally said she has a \u2018game addiction\u2019 and is working with a therapist. Why are you convinced she doesn\u2019t have a disorder she herself has said she\u2019s been diagnosed with?\n\nI mean, I was only responding to the comparisons you made originally. Personally I think you\u2019re getting lost in \u2018video games can\u2019t ever be an addiction!\u2019 Maybe because video games help your son? Which again is great. But it is not great for OP if gaming is taking up all her time and hindering her relationship with her parents - which she herself has said and described how it does in her post.\n\nNowhere have I said her parents behaviour is appropriate or helpful. Nowhere have I said YTA either for OP or that her parents are right. I\u2019m simply saying your adamance that OP doesn\u2019t have an addiction and her behaviour is totally fine is strange, and not actually in line with what\u2019s said or described about her own behaviours or diagnoses in her own post.\n\nAnd as far as we know, her psychologist has actually not said \u2018you don\u2019t have an addiction\u2019 or \u2018your behaviour is totally normal and healthy and you should keep gaming\u2019 like you are saying. What they HAVE said is \u2018your parents behaviour is unhelpful\u2019. They are not the same thing at all and again, it\u2019s not right that you\u2019re equating one with the other.\n\nI just don\u2019t get why you\u2019re convinced she doesn\u2019t have an addiction and are arguing she doesn\u2019t when she herself has said she does. You can have an addiction to lots of things outside drugs and alcohol, and also have mental health issues that aren\u2019t listed in the DSM. It isn\u2019t an encyclopaedia of every single mental health disorder or problematic behaviour that exists. It changes and is updated constantly with new clusters of behaviour that are common enough in different individuals to have one term.\n\nYou seem to think if something isn\u2019t a disorder in the DSM then it\u2019s not problematic - actually it\u2019s very possible to have problematic behaviour that ISN\u2019T a fixed diagnosis with an easy, cut and dry term like \u2018gaming addiction\u2019. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s therefore fine/not harmful. I mean a hell of a lot of mental disorders overlap, they\u2019re just terms to describe a cluster of behaviours and thought patterns. They aren\u2019t these big concrete \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019, \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019, \u2018exist\u2019 or \u2018don\u2019t exist\u2019 things you seem to think they are?\n\nLike if someone was watching TV and doing absolutely nothing else then again, that would be problematic behaviour that would be correct in causing concern. Just because the DSM doesn\u2019t list \u2018TV addiction\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s therefore fine and not an issue. Maybe you think I\u2019m against gaming? I\u2019m a millennial who games a lot lol, I get it can be social etc. I love it. But OP hasn\u2019t described any of that in her post\u2026 and again has literally said \u2018I have a gaming addiction and spend all my waking time outside work gaming\u2019. That\u2019s just not gonna be good or healthy any way you wanna cut it.\n\nI just really don\u2019t get why you\u2019re so fixed that OP doesn\u2019t have a problem when she herself has said she does and is working with a therapist. It isn\u2019t what OP herself has said at all and is based on assumptions about what her therapist has actually said and thinks (nothing that we know of except \u2018your parents are doing more harm\u2019) and strange perceptions of what the DSM/diagnoses do and don\u2019t mean.", "No, even if you were talking about a recovering alcoholic it would not be okay.

That's how the government sees it, that's how the legal system sees it, that's even how OP sees it. It doesn't matter if they are saving up the rent she gives them for her or if they blow it all on cigarettes and lotto tickets - because she pays them rent she is a tenant. And as a tenant she has certain rights, like not having her property stolen or broken. Her parents are breaking the law in their futile attempts to control their adult child. All they are doing is pushing her away with their attempts, and these will likely be the missing missing reasons why she no longer talks to them after moving out. I have no sympathy for them because their actions are both illegal and not in line with their supposed goal of spending more time with their daughter.\n\nThat your friends have an adult child living with them is not important to what I'm trying to say. They aren't OP's parents and their son is not OP. I honestly do not care about them, because they have no bearing on OP's situation. However, it sounds like they have failed as parents if their adult son lives rent free in their home but doesn't want to associate with them. They are now getting their feelings hurt because the way they raised their son is causing him to act. I also have zero sympathy for them.", "Yes, that's part of the depression: the lack of joy in pretty much anything. It saps you of your ability to pick up new hobbies or interests. And yes, it's not healthy, which is why OP has a therapist. She's working on it. Her parents certainly aren't helping by robbing her of what little joy she actually does get in her day to day life. And not to project my own battle with depression, perhaps playing video games gives her a sense of control in this otherwise chaotic world.", "She said she does most of her socializing while playing games with both IRL and online friends. This isn't a diagnosable disorder. This is just her generation's way of socializing and it's quite common. Keep in mind Covid also kept us all indoors for 2 years. Cut her some slack. Not everyone needs the same kind of socializing. Just because you'd be depressed by it doesn't mean she is. She doesn't need to find another activity. She loves this one and it brings her joy and relaxation.", "Yeah no shit we\u2019ve already established she has a problem. Either way NTA", "Coming from a mental health background, I really have a hard time believing the therapist said that. And if they did, the therapist is going off of only OP's report of what is going on.

There are far too many variables in life and social situations for therapists to respond to for one person's perspective to be considered complete and unbiased. -- especially when one or more parties have been diagnosed as addictions. \n\nThe note is less than solid proof.", "Why even bring up starting a family? Who can afford one in this economy?", "As someone who developed an addiction to the internet/computer as a trauma response to my friend killing themself when I wasn\u2019t online, it is absolutely possible the psychologist recommends she keep her pc as removing it could cause more damage than solve anything. \n\nI had the same recommendation from my therapist when my parents cut internet and tried to take my laptop. Unless the addiction is causing active physical or monetary harm/putting you in danger, it is rarely recommended for you to just \u201cquit\u201d your addiction like that. You address the mental side of the addiction and work towards limiting the activity or creating coping methods to help you stay away from it.

One is that gaming can be destructive to living a productive life and taking care of yourself; on the other hand if you have some diagnosis,  autism is the big one that comes to mind, it can be a way to be able to socially interact through a set of predefined rules that you understand which in cases like this it is more about tools to manage it around other aspects of your life. For some people the anxiety of talking to people face to face and not understanding those interactions and that being the only way to have social interaction can lead to a debilitating fear of interacting because of so many perceived negative social interactions that dont follow the rules they have the tools to understand. The online game play gives a basis for social interaction and ability to find and form bonds with people positively that can give confidence that wouldnt be developed otherwise and spill into other aspects of life like going to the grocery store or going to work because they internalize that not all social interactions are going to be negative.", "As long as they're handling the rest of life, they're fine.

If I were addicted to driving, are you going to slash up my vehicle and cry \"Well I'm just trying to help?\"?  \n\n\n2) If you had actually read the post, they were doing everything correctly up until malicious intent was placed. They came home, they had their property destroyed, then, property stolen. These are both crimes, you are committing a crime by doing this.  \n\n\n3) The addiction isn't harmful in the way you're trying to compare it to alcoholism. Where it's destroying organs and destroying cognitive skills in the sense alcoholism or hard drugs would do. In fact, they are still a productive member of society and only protested after, again, two crimes were committed.   \n\n\n4)  They are still a productive member of society, they went to their job, they were paying rent, and all they did was use their free time, as a fucking adult, to play games with friends.   \n\n\n5) It's still, a fucking crime, to hold property hostage and destroy property regardless of the situation. If they were a minor? the law is bent a little differently, sure.

I just pointed out to them that my friend Emi, who I've had since I was just shy of 20 years old is not any different.

In my state, if you have a guest stay more than 3 days they have formed residency and will need to go through courts for a formal eviction. And that's without paying rent.", "Nowhere in that post does OP say she'd prefer to live alone in a one bedroom apartment if she wasn't living at home , let alone does she give a rationale why she'd prefer to live alone instead of with roommates. So my question of why she wouldn't live with roommates if it would be cheaper still stands. Especially considering the other reason she gave about her mental health doesn't really hold up anymore if her parents are making things worse.", "Especially since OP here is going to work and the gaming addiction is keeping them occupied, indoors, and physically safe, unlike say, a heroin addiction or something that might involve more risky behavior. \n\nAnnnnnndddd OP also mentioned playing games with IRL friends. This sounds like a form of social engagement, which is actually a helpful thing for many people experiencing mental health struggles. \n\nWhy are so many people assuming \u201cdestroy gaming equipment\u201d and \u201cnever game again\u201d must have been the advice? I guess that\u2019s what they learned in their PhD program at Armchair University\u2026\ud83d\ude44", "OP plays games with IRL friends, too. So even if the interactions are online, it sounds like these are meaningful friendships and gaming is how OP socializes. Cutting off OP\u2019s ability to game makes no sense.", "I didn't miss any point.\n\nI addressed the damage portion\n\nYou ignore the point she is an addict, addicts routinely blame other people and the other people have to put up with a lot of crap because of someone's addiction\n\nIf the OP is indeed paying \"above average rent,\" then it should be even easier for them to move out and continue to save money.\n\nCheers", "She didn't have to state it outright. Since OP both stated that she's overpaying for what she currently has and still considers it to be saving money, basic common sense tells us there are only two options: 1) the alternatives she was considering were more expensive than living with her parents OR 2) she's just really fucking bad at math. \n\nI'm not sure what argument you're trying to make here, but it is exceedingly pedantic. If her goal was to save money, that doesn't necessarily have to mean saving the most money possible. It very likely just means saving money over the alterative option. But could she live with roommates or rent a room for cheaper? Sure. She could also live under a bridge. I honestly don't care that much.", "Basically this entire thread. Smh.\n\nAnd depressingly, this is actually a notch above how mental illness gets treated IRL still.", "Also, where do you get the fact that I said when you rent a place includes utilities, I said a room I never once said when you rent an apartment, you get utilities included but seldom Can you find an efficiency with a private entrance with utilities included but like I said, when you rent a room from anyone is generally has utilities included."]}
