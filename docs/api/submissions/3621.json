She's also not the type of person to make random purchases or anything major for herself.\n\nWe were discussing the process for moving in, discussing a rental property Ive been working towards and so forth when she asked about getting a gaming console that costs about $400. She had stated she will use her own money\n\nNow we will already have one that, though not brand new, can do the job well enough. \n\nI told her that I'm not on board with that idea because once she and I are together I'll need her help to manage the bills. And since she will not work for a bit it's important to conserve as much as possible. Since the whole movie alone will cost us $5000 easily between plane tickets, transport, etc. Which I will need her help on. \n\nShe immediately became distant and upset even after I explained once she works full time and we are financially secure then put money aside for yourself or we can joint the savings and pay together but it's too risky to try and do this until such a time. \n\nSo. AITAH for telling my wife that she cannot use her own money to buy a gaming console and instead should use it to help pay for the move?\n\nEdit: this seems unclear and I apologize, let me clarify the situation. \n\n1. My wife has about $2000 in her savings. The plane ticket alone will cost $1000. She will be coming to my country with only $1000 in our currency.\n\n2. I, on top of having standard bills, will have to pay $2000+ for a plane ticket and probably another $2000+ upon return for the first and last month in rent. I have enough to cover this but moving forward each month will come to about $2200+ to which I bring home $2400 a month this is not fracturing in anything random like fuel costs because I work from home. \n\n3. My wife wanted to spend her remaining balance to a gaming console even though we will already have one. I suggested that we hold off because it may be difficult to get by on a single income until such a time that she finds employment and I may need help with things like food or utilities. \n\n4. I also will not spend any money on useless items because I simply cannot afford to. We both have an agreed upon rule that whatever applies to one applies to the other.\n\n5. I am not saying her money is my money and I'm in absolute control for the rest of our lives. She will come to Canada with maybe $1000 in her pockets. Of that she wants to spend $400 on a game console when I'm going to be the sole income until she can work. \nI'm asking her to at least help with food and making sure we don't have any true financial difficulty before we/she spends on a luxury item. If I'm covering rent, bills, car, etc I don't think it's rude of me to ask that we make sure we have everything necessary before spending on unnecessary items especially if we already have these items.", "created_utc": 1669836810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z90sdx/aitah_for_telling_my_wife_that_its_no_longer_her/", "score": 719, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has yet to spend anything, she asked him first like a good wife.", "If she is in a country where $2000CAD is equal maybe $20K local currency then it is a lot.", "Leave her in India, you stay in Canada, get divorced now. It will be much cheaper than the alternative, which is to spend a ton of money moving her, go broke, maybe end up evicted or homeless, and definitely divorced.", "That info must have been in the comments. Didn't see it.", "So mail order bride? You do know when she's in the country she's gonna leave you, right?", "Then why are you even on here asking?", "I live in Canada and my natural gas bill for October was just over $400 and that's BEFORE winter really started to hit. I am not looking forward to seeing what Novembers bill is going to look like. In fairness I live further north than Toronto in a much colder part of the country.", "It doesn't even get very cold where I live in Texas, but our gas bill for heating, cooking, and the water heater is ~$125 to 200 a month, depending on the time of year.", "I mean it\u2019s all relative, I\u2019m far North of Toronto but my heating bill in the dead of winter is like $140 without new windows, and 25 if that is my hot water heater I\u2019m in a small bungalow, and unless you get the big square footage McMansion\u2026", "Is that per month? \ud83d\ude31", "Same", "Ah, hopefully you're right. That would be so much better.", "I have 2 good friends from India, both were married under similar situations. One spoke to her now husband on the phone then met him twice over long weekends before getting engaged and married. They didn\u2019t live together for almost 1.5 years and they were both in the United States. The other kept saying he needed to get married soon and a week before a trip home to India mentioned to us he decided he was going to get married on the trip. She was a family friend he hadn\u2019t seen in years. They spent a few days together then he came back to the United States for another 2 years before she was finally able to move here. To me this story doesn\u2019t seem that crazy.", "I totally misread that, thank you. \n\nThe whole thing still feels sketchy, but less so now lol", "Everything about this is a terrible idea.", "He's 23. According to his post history, he and his wife are \"very long distance\" and have seen eachother for 30 days total over 5 YEARS.\n\n\nIf I had to guess? Introverted kid made a female friend on discord/in game when he was in high school. She's from a 2nd world country, so they've had a mostly online relationship since he was a teenager, and they got married to try to bring her over on a spousal visa. Which is nowhere near as simple as he probably thought it was.", "I also guessed arranged marriage but ruled it out for the same reason. She may have had her family trying to arrange a marriage to someone else. Unsure about that. But I\u2019m not surprised they didn\u2019t want her to marry into this situation", "She\u2019s a good saver and he has bills, so he can put her in charge of managing finances.", "i read it as all the monthly costs add up to 2200, not just the rent.", "Arranged marriages work like this, too.", "Lol, i started saving in august and have a little over 1,1 k in my savings account and start panicking whenever it drops under 1k (spent on winter clothes and christmas gifts) \nI'm saving for a down payment and new furniture when i move out of my dorm next summer", "They don\u2019t sound like they should be married, to be honest. They both seem clueless, but for different reasons.", "There are countries where $1000us is a shit ton of money. I spent almost a month in Thailand, between hotels, restaurants, taxis, and fun shopping I still want less than $400us.", "people can't usually work as soon as they land in a new country. I'm not an immigration expert but she probably needs to be in the country first in order to apply for residency so she can start working since she is coming over as his wife, not on a work permit.", "Yeah you are right. sounds like a 90 day fiance situation. Not a good way to start a marriage.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I don't think you read the initial post either, the title sounds bad but he actually seems like he has a point.

And we have new windows and siding.", "There's a lot that goes into it - building standards, cost of energy, etc. $140/month to be warm in a Canadian winter sounds pretty good to me!", "Yeah, it's an old house and needs to be torn apart re insulated, new windows etc. That's this summer's project.", "Back where I live, this would be nearly two-months worth of minimum wage saved. While not crazy much, it would still be enough for a couple months worth of rent and food. This really can be someones months or years of savings, depending of where she is from", "I have friends who have spouses that have immigrated and they needed to wait, this just seems like a long time and they (or at least he) seems very young, that\u2019s all. I just think there\u2019s more to the story.", "Ok I went waaaaaaay back in OP\u2019s post history and his wife is Indian from a very traditional family and they didn\u2019t want her to marry him", "Omg wow lol. Sounds like a recipe for disaster.", "She's a \"good saver\" because she has no expenses.", "Even without paying rent, it's not considered much in germany \n\nBut, the lack of understand economy isn't the kids fault, imho.

College fees?\"\n\nI had savings, so I wasn't struggling, but to suddenly live on my own is something else", "Sounds like they could easily save that 2000 on his flights if he's only going overseas to \"pick up\" his wife", "OR, he just waits for her at the airport and saves 2000 for not going there to pick her up and bring back!", "Well it already seems a little controlling so who knows? Good question", "For real, it all seems like a super bad idea with both of them ending up on the street.", "My house is like that too, but we live in a place where the average winter temperature is about 50 degrees, so we can usually get by by putting on another sweater and an extra pair of socks.", "Same.

Or am I misunderstanding what you are saying?", "But he\u2019s paying for all of the rent, utilities, food etc? That\u2019s *his* money that he can\u2019t use the way he wishes because he\u2019s supporting her.", "Lol I wish. It was -18c here today , I think that's around 0 F.", "In fairness it looks like its $2200 for all of his bills INCLUDING rent, not only rent, but its still a lot. One financial emergency could easily put them over the edge. Unfortunately the housing/ rental market in Canada is going absolutely crazy right now and there is a massive shortage of affordable housing. Alberta has been running an ad campaign in Ontario trying to draw people to the province with the promise of more affordable rent prices, but in Calgary (the biggest city in Alberta) rents have gone up by a third in the last year alone. The whole country is feeling the unaffordability crisis.", "The lettuce thing is because of disease that melts the lettuce in the fields, not inflation. But, shit is indeed fucked, in general.", "Yes, Canadian Tire money.", "Fair. I must have missed the part where OP is Canadian. \n\nI still think that $2k Canadian probably goes a lot further in her home country than Canada since she seems to otherwise be pretty frugal according to OP.", "An important distinction because the conversion rate means this is about US$1500. \n\nAdd in purchasing power differences and the real value might be even lower (although as an Aussie I'm not sure what purchasing power differences exist between Canada and the US).", "Or India. Arranged marriages, super common.", "This is true, I am just saying that to you guys might not be a lot as there are a lot of comments who state she isn\u2019t good at saving money at all, like people are not aware there are poorer countries in the world, and they are making judgemental comments about someone we only see from a guy who she is moving for. \n\n\nLike how you mentioned she has no savings at all, which from your perspective might be true, but it could be that it took her a very long time to save that. \n\nI wanna know more about how they met, because to me it does sound like a mail order bride. We do not know what this dude told her or put in her head, especially that she seems to be willing to move to his country so she will not have anyone apart from him. Bit of a power imbalance to me.", "Sorry, I assumed you were American which is why I used F. We get down to freezing about 6 nights a year, in the middle of the night. Maybe at the absolute coldest, it's -2C, again in the middle of the night. The downside though is that building standards here are crap. They build for summer - huge walls of windows everywhere - ignoring the fact that it's not summer most of the year. My next big project will be replacing two massive windows that take up pretty much the entire wall in the family room with double pane windows..That will hopefully make a big difference.", "Yeah I know,  but admit it sounds nice and dramatic.  18 dollar lettuce!", "No, there is no conversion rate. $2000 CAD has the buying power of $2000 CAD, lmao."]}
