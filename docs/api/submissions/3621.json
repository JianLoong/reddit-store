She's also not the type of person to make random purchases or anything major for herself.\n\nWe were discussing the process for moving in, discussing a rental property Ive been working towards and so forth when she asked about getting a gaming console that costs about $400. She had stated she will use her own money\n\nNow we will already have one that, though not brand new, can do the job well enough. \n\nI told her that I'm not on board with that idea because once she and I are together I'll need her help to manage the bills. And since she will not work for a bit it's important to conserve as much as possible. Since the whole movie alone will cost us $5000 easily between plane tickets, transport, etc. Which I will need her help on. \n\nShe immediately became distant and upset even after I explained once she works full time and we are financially secure then put money aside for yourself or we can joint the savings and pay together but it's too risky to try and do this until such a time. \n\nSo. AITAH for telling my wife that she cannot use her own money to buy a gaming console and instead should use it to help pay for the move?\n\nEdit: this seems unclear and I apologize, let me clarify the situation. \n\n1. My wife has about $2000 in her savings. The plane ticket alone will cost $1000. She will be coming to my country with only $1000 in our currency.\n\n2. I, on top of having standard bills, will have to pay $2000+ for a plane ticket and probably another $2000+ upon return for the first and last month in rent. I have enough to cover this but moving forward each month will come to about $2200+ to which I bring home $2400 a month this is not fracturing in anything random like fuel costs because I work from home. \n\n3. My wife wanted to spend her remaining balance to a gaming console even though we will already have one. I suggested that we hold off because it may be difficult to get by on a single income until such a time that she finds employment and I may need help with things like food or utilities. \n\n4.

Best of luck with the move!", "Maybe young and lives with parents who pays for all that?", "I don\u2019t think this guy has a grasp on anything. The woman\u2019s savings is $2000, and his rent is more than that per month. This sounds so much like a mail order bride situation or something. Or someone the guy met online but never actually saw, and now she\u2019s moving to a whole other country.", "Omg they\u2019re in Ontario? LOL. I live here and I\u2019d be livid if my spouse spent $400 on a gaming console when they didn\u2019t work and had 2k in savings", "Yup. Until I read the edit I was on Team Y T A, but the edit changes everything. $200 a month for food, utilities, petrol, etc is not feasible. I'd imagine in a Canadian winter that would be the heating bill for one month.", "Yeah based on the edit, definitely NTA.", "But from the gist they aren't saving to together, isn't actively working atm, and needs to pay bills for the move as well as other necessities again it's gonna be their house a want purchase can wait to secure their needs first", "Agree with NAH. It\u2019s her money, but it\u2019s also not responsible for her to be spending $400 on a gaming console if she only has $2,000 and expenses coming up. I was prepared to say OP was TA based on the beginning of the post and the title, but the details about everything else made me change my mind. I hope this is something they\u2019re able to work out because money and differences in financial habits could cause major issues in the future.", "Since he edited the post, is 2000$ a lot of savings? She\u2019s moving somewhere where that wouldn\u2019t even cover a rent deposit.", "Did you read this?", "Rent, I wish I was paying mortgage.", "You are totally right that there are always so many extra things that come up in a move, but I\u2019m not comfortable giving n t a here. OP doesn\u2019t make enough compared to rent to live, hasn\u2019t had discussions previous to move-in with partner about how they will split finances, bills, spending money, etc.  OP doesn\u2019t save (although I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s because they literally don\u2019t make enough money to both house and feed self). So while I would totally explain why any purchases right now might not be a good thing and write out (or make a visual chart or whatever) of all the expenses that will need to be shared, all the weird extra expenses that come up in a move that you aren\u2019t expecting, etc., I\u2019d also say at the very least ESH since it sounds like no one has really thought through everything. \n\nAlso, for OP, once you do iron all this out, an easy way not to argue about fun spending is to budget individual  spending money for each of you into each month\u2019s budget. That way you each get to make independent choices about what you spend on fun for yourselves. If you want something more expensive than that month\u2019s money, you have to save up over however many months it takes to purchase it. Budget combined spending money for going out and doing things together (or gaming at home, whatever) as separate from individual spending money. \n\nAnd have your partner check out linustech on YouTube. She might be able to get a gaming rig that I will work for her for much cheaper.", "What's yours is mine. And what's mine... is mine.", "So she shouldn't contribute to her own move and should make pointless spending while I'm stuck with the $5000 bill?\n\nEdit: or help pay for food, rent, bills until such a time that buying luxury items can be more easily obtainable?", "Suggest to hold off, in the end it's her decision but I explained why I'm not on board.", "This is what I told her, that just until we get things settled that we shouldn't make any unnecessary spending but once we're good then I'll go out with her and buy one too", "We did. Which is why I'm here because we did talk about this but...here we are", "He's an AH for not wanting to subsidize their move and cover all expenses after the move until she finds a new job while she spends what little savings she does have on a gaming console? I hope you made this post before OP posted the update.", "So kinda tsol if we didn't have money for food but she had money for an game console?", "Can you not read? OP would be supporting her after the move.", "Yes, this post was made without of information that he has since added.", "I did, yes.", "Seems like a perfect representation of the post", "So you need to split the rent, that is the problem.  She is hoarding the money for herself.  You should edit your original post to say YOU are paying all the rent, utilities etc", "This sounds like you two need to talk a hell of a lot more about financial contribution to the joint household. Make a budget so you can see what's on the table. One time costs like moving affairs, and periodic costs.\n\nExclaiming that you two can't afford a PlayStation is different than having data (which will help her allocate her own discretionary spending while still contributing to the household).", "When you guys got married, what was your agreement when you discussed household spending?", "I thought you said you had a pretty good grasp on the bills.  Why are you making this move, if it\u2019s going to make your financial situation so precarious you\u2019re not comfortable spending anything beyond the relocation costs?  More importantly, why didn\u2019t you discuss what you were expecting her to contribute *before* now, much less before settling on a location?", "yikes. i think you all should get divorced before moving.", "What should happen is you both keep your personal bills separate. You open a joint account and you each deposit your portion of the monthly expenses.", "It sounds like she has a big savings account from your post. She can split moving costs with you and still buy herself a console. She doesn't need to give up all her savings for your bills though. Your post sounded more like you want her to pay your bills and not let her spoil herself one time (you said she's not one to make major purchases for herself). So yeah YTA. You are trying to control *her* money and how she spends it.", "Info: does she have the money to pay her share and buy the item? Yes, YTA.", "Um yea , you said she doesn\u2019t really buy things for her self so yea she can.", "Deciding someone else\u2019s spending is pointless is a frequent symptom of assholitis.", "I think your nta then. She\u2019s being financially irresponsible and immature. If y\u2019all have agreed to share finances than you did nothing wrong by suggesting she not frivolously spend the remainder of her money on games", "You seem like a sensible guy, I don't know why everyone is being so harsh here.\nIt is only right that you share the costs of everything.", "Yea I did", "Clearly you didn't cause them moving along with bills could be a well off purchase at the moment and to hold it off for a bit cause it might take a hit to her savings is asshole behavior", "Maybe before the update. $2,000 absolutely is not a lot of savings, especially if she's going to spend half of that on a plane ticket.", "That!", "She has maybe $2000 and if that $1000 is for the plane ticket. \n\nI don't want her to pay MY bills but things like food or utilities. \n\nThat takes precedence over a gaming console.", "The original post left out a lot of context. He suggested she has a lot of savings and could easily cover the cost of a console and her share of expenses.", "I'm probably not explaining it properly which I get. \n\nThey're taking it like I'm in control of all of her money, but no. Just for this specific balance of $1000 I don't think spending $400+ on a gaming console is worth the risk of being without food because God knows how expensive it is. $100 can't even feed some people for a week.", "We clearly disagree about what constitutes an asshole. The original post read as if there's enough money to make the move but he didn't want her to spend hers. Simple reading comprehension.", "Did you meet this person before marrying her? Had ANY sort of discussion around finances? Or did you just assume that her money is now yours too?", "\nBills should be split equally 50-50", "You're painting a different picture of her finances than you did in your original post.", "I mean, I wouldn\u2019t buy anything new before a move just in case anything needs to be replaced/emergency happens just until we\u2019ve settled in"]}
