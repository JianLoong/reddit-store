She's also not the type of person to make random purchases or anything major for herself.\n\nWe were discussing the process for moving in, discussing a rental property Ive been working towards and so forth when she asked about getting a gaming console that costs about $400. She had stated she will use her own money\n\nNow we will already have one that, though not brand new, can do the job well enough. \n\nI told her that I'm not on board with that idea because once she and I are together I'll need her help to manage the bills. And since she will not work for a bit it's important to conserve as much as possible. Since the whole movie alone will cost us $5000 easily between plane tickets, transport, etc. Which I will need her help on. \n\nShe immediately became distant and upset even after I explained once she works full time and we are financially secure then put money aside for yourself or we can joint the savings and pay together but it's too risky to try and do this until such a time. \n\nSo. AITAH for telling my wife that she cannot use her own money to buy a gaming console and instead should use it to help pay for the move?\n\nEdit: this seems unclear and I apologize, let me clarify the situation. \n\n1. My wife has about $2000 in her savings. The plane ticket alone will cost $1000. She will be coming to my country with only $1000 in our currency.\n\n2. I, on top of having standard bills, will have to pay $2000+ for a plane ticket and probably another $2000+ upon return for the first and last month in rent. I have enough to cover this but moving forward each month will come to about $2200+ to which I bring home $2400 a month this is not fracturing in anything random like fuel costs because I work from home. \n\n3. My wife wanted to spend her remaining balance to a gaming console even though we will already have one. I suggested that we hold off because it may be difficult to get by on a single income until such a time that she finds employment and I may need help with things like food or utilities. \n\n4. I also will not spend any money on useless items because I simply cannot afford to. We both have an agreed upon rule that whatever applies to one applies to the other.\n\n5. I am not saying her money is my money and I'm in absolute control for the rest of our lives. She will come to Canada with maybe $1000 in her pockets. Of that she wants to spend $400 on a game console when I'm going to be the sole income until she can work. \nI'm asking her to at least help with food and making sure we don't have any true financial difficulty before we/she spends on a luxury item. If I'm covering rent, bills, car, etc I don't think it's rude of me to ask that we make sure we have everything necessary before spending on unnecessary items especially if we already have these items.", "created_utc": 1669836810, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z90sdx/aitah_for_telling_my_wife_that_its_no_longer_her/", "score": 344, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The whole situation seems iffy.  She has savings, of 2K..thats not even a months rent.  He has bills, because he has lived as an adult in a place he cannot truly afford.  She has no bills, as it seems someone else pays for her.  She needs to understand the combining of lives, finances, responsibilities..he needs to understand someone who has not had these will take time understanding these....whew..good luck.", "I wasn't judging your addiction per se just that this was an added cost to what seems like a difficult financial situation. \n\nIt wasn't clear from your post that you were a high performer; you said you messed up before. \n\nLots of comments were asking about your relationship but you seemed reluctant to answer. \n\nYou came on this sub SPECIFICALLY to be judged, I used the information available to do so.", "I read the edits. She still shouldn\u2019t move in with you.", "Why is her ticket 1000$ but his ticket add up to 4000$something isn't right.", "Fair.  Although I\u2019ve kinda gone from wondering \u201cwhat\u2019s the problem here?\u201d to \u201chow much longer is $1,000 really going to last them than $600 anyway?\u201d  And I\u2019ve *still* got a ton of questions about how this plan came together and how much time they spent talking it out.  Hopefully they\u2019ve got some good ideas for getting her a job pretty quickly. :/", "OP should have a conversation where they BOTH agree to their commitments and what is shared and what is separate. OP should not decree she cannot spend money without his agreement, especially when that money is money she has made.", "It sounds like he wants her to pay *his. bills. I feel like I\u2019m not understanding.", "Xbox controller lab is the bee\u2019s knees", "Don't need to.  My judgement stands.", "I guess I couldn\u2019t be arsed to finish. OP sounds like an asshole. \n\nAs do you. \n\nCongratulations.", "It's her money. You already admit she saves like crazy and you're basically denying her and telling her she's not allowed with her own money. It's controlling and feels of am off dynamic", "\u201cSaves her money like crazy\u201d I was thinking tens of thousands but $2k?? I\u2019m a junior in college working part time and I feel like I\u2019m way behind with having only $2k in my savings!!!", "Im thinking a young person living in a country where $2k is a lot of money or has never had to pay rent, etc. I have seen this attitude in young people (18-20) when they have no real understanding of economy.", "Yeah, I don\u2019t think OP did a great job of explaining\n and I really don\u2019t think they are an a h so much as I think neither partner has thought through all the budgetary stuff in detail. It also sounds like OP\u2019s not having savings might be a side effect of their salary vs. genuine living expenses in a high-cost-of living area. I tried not to gender OP but will go back and check to make sure I didn\u2019t. \n\nI also think that short-format writing for an audience is hard. The beginning sentences could sound controlling, but I think what OP is saying is that there is limited income right now, they\u2019re worried, and want to limit non-essential purchases. (But also maybe like they didn\u2019t go about explaining very well to their partner and it came out sounding like an order rather than a discussion an explanation.)", "And he\u2019s not telling her no you can never buy this, but let\u2019s wait until we\u2019re in a better financial situation which is really reasonable. I don\u2019t always think separate finances are the way to go in relationships, but in this case I think it\u2019s the best move. At least until they\u2019re able to get on the same page about financial decisions (assuming that ever happens). I would love to know the ages here because her lack of bills and views on money make her seem very young.", "Im sorry then, I'm not trying to be a jerk. \n\nThere's so many comments its hard to get all of them. \n\nThankfully my addiction has been curbed, my anxiety for work is more basdd on past negative experience and constant fear even though no actual evidence is present. \n\nAnd that is fair, sadly some would rather judge before knowing more and I try to keep up by the edits but it's difficult \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut tbh the issue is already resolved and my wife apologized for sounding upset. So I'll probably remove this soon.", "From reading the breakdown, it looks like $1000 for a one-way ticket (her). Then $2000 for his round-trip ticket. Then $2000 for first/last month rent.", "I don't really understand why he has to go to her first. To help her move? Carry her stuff? What is the point of that trip? Yes it will be hard for her to handle getting multiple bags/boxes on a plane, but sure shipping some of it would be cheaper than this plan?", ">\u201chow much longer is $1,000 really going to last them than $600 anyway?\u201d\n\nWhen you're broke, every penny counts.", "from the edits it looks like he wants her to help pay \"their\" new bills not his bills. But yes. If it was just \"his\" bills, I'd agree with you.", "You aren't understanding....the bills he's talking about are their rent, deposit for the rental, utilities, groceries", "His bills being rent, electricity, groceries and her not contributing to anything? Those are household bills.", "Read the edits. They are much more enlightening.", "The post was written poorly. The edits make it much more clear. When he refers to bills he is talking about joint expenses for their household (formerly his household).", "In the edit she only has 2k, 1k after flying. That's literally no savings at all!", "The post says no.", "She CAN save like crazy but at this moment she only has maybe $2000 in her acct which after the plane ticket will be reduced to $1000. \n\nPlease read edits before commenting.", "They are married but don\u2019t yet live together, her plane ticket to Canada is $1000, and she\u2019s moving to Ontario from a different country.\n\nI\u2019m guessing she is from a poorer/less expensive country where $2k American goes A LOT further.", "She's coming from another country. The currency might be weaker and that $2000 could represent months of savings. I don't think she fully understands how little her remaining $1000 will purchase here, (especially if OP has her thinking that $200 a month is enough to live on. And he's Canadian- I'm astounded he doesn't realize that he can't afford a $2200 rent on a $2400 income. He's relying on the financial help of someone who has $1000 to her name?) Yikes.", "It's very confusing because it sounds like OP already lives in Canada and wife is joining him?", "Fair play to you for your honesty and respect. I wish you all the best", "Ok gotcha. I was confused.I hope in his budget he accounted for food because 200$ isn't much left", "Exactly, plus gaming consoles are usually pretty useless without games as well, which would cost anywhere from $20 to $80 a piece.", "Yeah I was picturing a much larger savings when he wrote the post. That is pretty important information he left out and seems kind of fishy.", "It could be a large amount if she is coming from a poorer country, which it sounds like she is. $2000 Canadian dollars is a LOT in some countries. Dude sounds like he got a mail order bride, he is just not honest about it here.", "Did she work? How can she just have 2k savings when she has no bills but \"saves like crazy\"?", "Well I see you edited your post to include this and you really should have from the start. From the way you wrote your post, saying she saves like crazy and has no bills to pay, I assumed that she had a savings account to dip into so that is why I said YTA because you would have been in that case.  Knowing this information makes you NTA, but I think you need to sit down with her and figure this stuff out before you move in together.", "I did read them. It's still not your money and she's allowed to get something for herself. You're not allowed to tell her she can't but something with HER savings. It's not a joint account and you didn't put in any of the money in her savings.  YOU get NO say.", "And she is from somewhere far enough for the plane ticket to be $1k, so probably Asia or Europe. So Im thinking she might not understand how different life is in Canada from what she is used to because she is either pretty young or has never had to pay a bill in her life.", "Probably comes from a poor country where her wage was crap. Or the currency conversion isn't that much in Canadian dollars.", "If she would really come from a poor country, then wanting to buy a gaming console - with that money you could feed a family for months in those countries -  even worse."]}
