It's supposed to be Daughter, not son.\n\nI don't use reddit but friends encouraged me to get opinions here. The damage is done and there's no salvaging this, I'm just looking to see if I'm justified in the extreme that I took or if I'm just an asshole.\n\nSo I (43F) and my soon to be ex husband \"Ralph\"(43M) have a daughter \"Diane\"(18F). Ralph works as a graphic artist and Diane eventually showed interest when planning on a career post high school, so she started taking electives related to it. The intention was that Ralph would put in a good word down the line for a job or internship at the same company he worked. For ALL classes related to graphic design, Ralph did easily 75% or more of the classwork. And I do not mean help, he straight up finished all the assignments after work that she would start in class and even submit them into Canvas himself on her account.  This never sat right with me and we would fight about this on a regular basis, yet the cheating continued and for two years, I just aired my grievances without every actually doing anything about it.\n\nOn Diane's senior year(so this school year) she successfully got accepted into a hybrid position at a local technical college, so she would take entry college level courses there in the morning and resume high school in the afternoon. Again, was very pissed that she got accepted with Ralph's work but I lost that argument. In May, I remember watching Ralph complete her assignments while Diane was eating cheetos watching Netflix when I think I finally had enough. She was about to graduate, was going to go to this college full time and we(mostly me, I was the breadwinner tbh so most of my money went towards that fund) were literally going to pay for tuition that would be mostly cheated on, and I thought this was beyond ridiculous and a wake up call needed to happen now. So, I emailed one of her instructors what I knew, and waited. Pretty quickly the college accused her and both Ralph and Diane knew it was me who said something right away. I'll spare you the details of that argument but we are divorcing as a result and Diane refuses to speak to me. A disciplinary meeting occurred, Diane had to prove that she was capable of the coursework on her own for some time and failed, so she was expelled. An investigation is also being conducted by the high school and she lost some elective credits but still graduated, she will not be able to attend this college again and there is a mark on her academic record. Ralph moved into a relative's place and Diane followed suit, we're going through the divorce now.\n\nSo, the family is pretty split on this with some saying I did the right thing while others say I should not have interfered, mostly Ralph's family. Am I right or wrong? If more info is needed I will gladly share.

Your character was tested in what was essentially a no-win scenario. NTA", "NTA. Diane needed to learn how to do the work herself, unless Ralph was planning to tag along at every job she takes to do that too.", "Holy shit that\u2019s rough to deal with! I\u2019m saying NTA. Clearly your morals and ethics are much higher standards than your ex husband\u2019s and your daughter\u2019s. Idk what else you could of done besides going nuclear, considering you addressed this before it got to be this bad. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you lost your husband and your daughter out of the situation but I think you did the right thing overall. Neither of them have any morals or ethics which is just sad. I think Diane would of gotten caught at some point but then again, maybe not.", "NTA. Academic integrity is no joke, and it's better she learn that now while she can potentially recover from it, rather than in college where it'll be a much bigger deal.", "NTA, but I'm not sure based on the post if you ever confronted your daughter or ex-husband about the situation before this point. If so, definitely justified. If this was your first time addressing it, then I'm a little confused why it was never addressed before with some less extreme measures. Obviously you can't fit every detail in a single post, and my opinion doesn't change in either scenario.\n\nRegardless, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Wow, that's a tough one.\n\nI'm gonna say NTA, they both earned this outcome, cheaters suck, but damn, being willing to end your marriage and your relationship with your child over it is unusual.  That's taking a stand all right, and I guess I can't fault you for honoring your principles!", "Yeesh\u2026..NTA, but I think there was more sensible actions you could have taken before dropping a nuke like this so the consequences were not so great. Or maybe you did? Apparently this post covers school of at least 2 years and the arguments are glossed over, so perhaps you fought like hell for a while but could only say so much with the character limit? You\u2019re not an asshole, but I do wonder if this was worth worth it in the end. I guess only time will tell.", "NTA\n\nBut you should have done this right from the start, before it got this bad.", "This was actually a very tough one. \n\nI\u2019m gonna go with ESH. \n\nShe\u2019d eventually have met up with the consequences when she lost her first few jobs, or failed her final year or something of that nature. \n\nIn my view, still a harsh fall from grace but enough to learn from it. It would also (ultimately) be easier to recover from than the stink of academic misconduct. There is almost no coming back from that. She\u2019s going to have a very difficult time gaining a good quality education anywhere now, no matter the field. \n\nI\u2019m not saying she should be coddled or that this was anything even next door to ethically or morally right. \n\nBut, you should have allowed for the natural consequences to occur. It perhaps wasn\u2019t your place to make it happen. \n\nThey would have happened eventually and you\u2019d still have a relationship with your daughter as you help her to both learn the lesson and to pick up the pieces of her mistake (which is our job as parents).  \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think you did the best thing. Even if it was technically the right thing.", "NTA -sorta. You went completely & totally nuclear. But the bottom line is that your husband was setting up your daughter for failure in the workforce. He should have been teaching your daughter how to do the work NOT do the work for her. He was wrong. Your daughter was wrong for allowing her father to do her work. \n\nBut you were wrong somewhat also-I think you possibly had other options available. I can appreciate your stance on this issue but only you can decide if it was worth imploding your family. Your daughter, though wrong, will probably cut you completely out of her life.", "Oof. Your desire to stop the cheating wasn't wrong but you went about it in a totally relationship destroying way. If you had it to do over again you could have started with  marriage counseling where you made it clear that 1) this parenting misbehavior was going to be a deal breaker if he didn't stop it and 2) you weren't writing tuition checks for any institution your daughter didn't get accepted to on her own. Your husband must have some seriously intense anxiety to go this far- I can't imagine what he thought the end game was. Was he going to do her first job for her? More than anything he was destroying her confidence and work ethic. But now you've destroyed your marriage, her family and she's farther away than ever from repairing the damage he was doing.

You\u2019re just as responsible for your daughter\u2019s upbringing as Ralph. It\u2019s pretty sad to think you destroyed your whole family unit because you let this problem fester until you felt like this was your only recourse. Your daughter might have procrastinated away her dreams of art school, but you just procrastinated yourself out of a family. \n\n\nI guess one pice of info that might change my mind here\u2026 was divorce ever a consideration before this all started?", "NTA at all. You didn't \"destroy\" your family, as others are suggesting. You begged them to realize what they were doing would end up badly for them in the long run and they simply didn't listen, *for years*.

Dad\u2019s behavior wasn\u2019t okay, and absent more information just seems kind of creepy. But, I think something should have been said sooner, if it was going to be said at all.

I know I could have done nothing and she would eventually be caught, but in my research I had found cases of students being caught cheating evolving into a criminal matter depending on how far the cheating escalated, and if she didn't get caught then, then surely Ralph and Diane would be found out because Ralph planned to do her work when she got a job too. It maybe wasn't my place but I eventually came to the conclusion that any consequences given now would be on a lesser scale than if they were caught years later, so I nipped it in the bud.", "I have fought with both husband and daughter about this for the entire duration this was going on I have lost count, and lost the battle every time because it was 2 vs 1.

Any damage was the daughter's doing by cheating. If anything OP saved her daughter from worse consequences because she would have eventually been found out, whether it was when she started college or when she started a job and then it could have turned into legal trouble.\n\n You also missed the part where her daughter was in highschool, she just got an opportunity for dual credit at a technical college. The kid is 18 and still has ample opportunity as long as she gets her act together and starts taking responsibility.\n\nWhy tf should the daughter be allowed to cheat and take opportunities away from other students that can actually do the work?"]}
