Ralph works as a graphic artist and Diane eventually showed interest when planning on a career post high school, so she started taking electives related to it. The intention was that Ralph would put in a good word down the line for a job or internship at the same company he worked. For ALL classes related to graphic design, Ralph did easily 75% or more of the classwork. And I do not mean help, he straight up finished all the assignments after work that she would start in class and even submit them into Canvas himself on her account.  This never sat right with me and we would fight about this on a regular basis, yet the cheating continued and for two years, I just aired my grievances without every actually doing anything about it.\n\nOn Diane's senior year(so this school year) she successfully got accepted into a hybrid position at a local technical college, so she would take entry college level courses there in the morning and resume high school in the afternoon. Again, was very pissed that she got accepted with Ralph's work but I lost that argument. In May, I remember watching Ralph complete her assignments while Diane was eating cheetos watching Netflix when I think I finally had enough. She was about to graduate, was going to go to this college full time and we(mostly me, I was the breadwinner tbh so most of my money went towards that fund) were literally going to pay for tuition that would be mostly cheated on, and I thought this was beyond ridiculous and a wake up call needed to happen now. So, I emailed one of her instructors what I knew, and waited. Pretty quickly the college accused her and both Ralph and Diane knew it was me who said something right away. I'll spare you the details of that argument but we are divorcing as a result and Diane refuses to speak to me. A disciplinary meeting occurred, Diane had to prove that she was capable of the coursework on her own for some time and failed, so she was expelled. An investigation is also being conducted by the high school and she lost some elective credits but still graduated, she will not be able to attend this college again and there is a mark on her academic record. Ralph moved into a relative's place and Diane followed suit, we're going through the divorce now.\n\nSo, the family is pretty split on this with some saying I did the right thing while others say I should not have interfered, mostly Ralph's family.
