How is it your issue the house work is not getting completed when 4 grown adults live in a house, and not one of the residents is you?? Stop taking blame for everything.\n\nYou made the right choice to move on with your life. Your brother made his choice to marry your bully. He can life with that choice. Not your problem.", "I hate that BS about how the amount of time means something isn't important. \n\nThat's just another way of saying that the speaker NEVER thought it was important. Do you know how I know? Because it doesn't work for everything.\n\nJust wait 10 years, and even murder can be described as \"something that happened more than 10 years ago\".\n\nOn the other hand, if you are talking about forgetting to pick up milk at the store when you promised you would, then talking about how long it's been makes perfect sense.\n\nHere's what this all means: Your brother doesn't care that you were bullied. The best possibility is that he doesn't understand what happened to you. The worst is that he understands and would rather deny it to avoid dealing with what he did to you by marrying your bully.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA. She traumatized you. She never sincerely apologized, instead she implied another threat. He chose to tie his life to your tormentor. You are well within your rights to avoid her rather than reopening the wound. If you want to try to accept her as part of your life, you have that option. But you need not do it. If your brother approached you with understanding and an attempt to truly reconcile, that would make him more sympathetic. Instead he continues to blame you and dismiss the harm she did and that he did by choosing her.", "NTA. He made the choice that split the family. By blaming you he's showing that he is every bit as horrible as his wife. Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nHe still doesn't give a rat's arse about your feelings. He's just frustrated bc no one is picking up the housework slack and he thinks you should go there and be their maid.", "NTA that's rich - your brother wants you to come over so you can clean up after the bully and him? Yeah, no. I'd stick to the original statement- once your brother and El Jerko leave, then you'll come over.", "NTA. You are not obliged to see him. If he cared about you, he wouldn't be able to love someone Who did you wrong.  Also, He never missed you all These years, and now he just wants to \"reconcile\" because he doesn't want to do house chores. Lazy AF", "NTA.  They can do for your mom and dad what you did before they moved in.", "NTA. You are in no way overreacting for setting those boundaries after what they did to you. That is extremely low of your brother to do that to you- no matter how long ago she was your bully. You deserve better from him. Now you are taking your time to still try and go over and help- which is very kind of you, and he\u2019s calling you the AH? Makes no sense.", ">My brother reached out to tell me I was a raging ah bc I was making everyone miserable for something that happened more than 10 years ago.\n\nInfo:  How exactly is he miserable? Did he miss you? Has he wanted to apologize and rebuild a relationship with you? Or is he just upset that you're not there to do the chores? \n\nIn any case, it's not up to you to accept an apology that was never given. Nor are you required to forgive what you haven't.", "NTA you have to protect your mental health first and foremost", "NTA.  How exactly are you \u201cmaking everyone miserable \u201c?  Because you aren\u2019t cooking or cleaning for them?  Why can\u2019t your brother and his wife do it?  You are still seeing your parents, but you don\u2019t owe brother and his wife a single thing.", "NTA. Let him enjoy his miserable life and continue to stay away from the evil SIL.", "nta. if mom wants you around more, she can get him and his family out. however he reached out; block any future attempts. his number, his social media, whatever. he made his choice, and choices have consequences.", "I\u2019m sorry. NTA, although it seems like your parents are the only ones suffering. Maybe they can kick them out, and you could move in.", "Protect yourself from any drama, it\u2019s not worth it. That\u2019s a firm boundary and sticking to it may help you to need less therapy. It\u2019s very empowering to say NO. For myself, it took about a month and I feel an almost calm zen when I use my NO!", "Why would you keep going over there to now clean up after/cook for all these additional people? They moved in so they need to help. NTA.", "NTA he knew, and he chose the bully over you. I don't blame you for refusing his and the bully's existence.", "NTA\n\nI love how people who've wronged others think things should be forgotten because it was soooo long ago.  \n\nThe situation is of your brother's making so he's the one responsible for people feeling miserable.  I'm not really sure how you going over and spending time with someone you hate is going to miraculously make everyone happy.  Maybe he just wants you to be as miserable as the rest of them.", "NTA- \nyou don\u2019t owe anyone your mental health. You\u2019ve been in therapy for ten years and she can\u2019t even muster a sincere apology\u2026. NC all the way. 10 years, 20 years, 50 years.. as long as you need to be well.", "NTA. He chose your bully. You're choosing yourself. More than that, *he's* attempting to *bully you* into making his life easier.\n\nAll the complaining your parents are doing, the things he doesn't like? They are all the consequences of his *own* actions. You still see your parents within the parameters of your own boundaries. There is absolutely *no need* for you to be doing all the household tasks at your parents when they now have two fully functional adults in the house with them.\n\nFor your parents, it's not about choosing between you. It's that they have chosen to support their son (understandable) and that choice has resulted in a lower quality of life for them. They recognise that and are therefore attempting to hold your brother responsible for that. They have been ineffective and it has ended up being put back on you.\n\nIf it was me, I'd block my brother and let my parents know that he's attempting to force you into doing what he wants. I'd tell my parents that I wouldn't allow his bullying to continue and that if being in their life brings my brother into my life then contact will have to be further reduced until he can be responsible for himself and his own actions.", "NTA \nYour brother honestly expected you to go to your parents house to cook for and clean up after his family? He must have lost some brain cells when he married that childhood bully of yours", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s saying you\u2019re making people miserable. It sounds like he expects a lot from everyone around him, you and your parents, but doesn\u2019t do much in return. If he expects that you\u2019re gonna continue to clean the house he\u2019s just crazy. Cleaning for your parents who are maybe older and don\u2019t get around too easy is wayyy different than cleaning up after a family with children. It\u2019s not your job. Especially if they are staying there free, it seems odd that they aren\u2019t contributing more.", "NTA, he and his bully wife can clean up after themselves. You are seeing your parents still which is the important thing.", "Do NOT clean up after your brother and his wife. Your parents want the house clean, they know where to look.", "Nah fuck his family! 4 adults and the house is a mess?", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThey can clean up after themselves. They don\u2019t want to be held accountable for any of their actions, including their current state of being a drain on your parents.", "NTA. He should be more mature and perhaps confronted your bully when they first started talking. Honestly, this is a prime opportunity for you to get some revenge. You can be petty and make fun of her for being poor or something. Seems like she was unrepentant. Don't be too hard on your brother for getting ruled by his dick though.", "NTA", "NTA . Honestly the history isn't even important here. Regardless of any of that THEY should be doing the cleaning and helping around the house. Why in the hell should you clean up after a bunch of random people who moved into your parents' house? \n\nNow add in the bullying? He can fuck all the way off.", "NTA. He made his decision and maybe if the bully actually apologized and made ammends this could have been avoided. But no she clearly isn't remorseful. She's the AH and your brother is the AH. Stick to your boundaries. Don't let them guilt trip you.", "Info - What did she do to you? I think it all hinges on that. If you don\u2019t feel like sharing, that\u2019s alright, but it\u2019s a missing part of the equation.", "Info - whats the actual time frame here? How did she bully you? When?", "Info: elaborate on the bullying please", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
