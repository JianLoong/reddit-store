Of course I feel bad saying that but the alternative is that I can\u2019t study or have a life based on whatever whim or want of hers. She is saying that her life is more important than mine and I should do whatever she wants whenever she wants without any regard for my own plans or future or welfare - and that I am somehow responsible for her own child.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, you are my mom and you\u2019re supposed to be protecting me not placating her. I am your child.
