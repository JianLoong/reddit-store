Of course I feel bad saying that but the alternative is that I can\u2019t study or have a life based on whatever whim or want of hers. She is saying that her life is more important than mine and I should do whatever she wants whenever she wants without any regard for my own plans or future or welfare - and that I am somehow responsible for her own child.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, you are my mom and you\u2019re supposed to be protecting me not placating her. I am your child.

Your aunt is a grade A AH. \n\nYour mom is a close second I'm afraid as she's enabling her sister to do this to you, instead of setting reasonable boundaries and just saying no is a start. not committing your time and allowing you to say no yourself would give you independent of choice but she should back you up. \n\nBurying her head in the sand then throwing you under the bus when it suited her instead of confronting her sister, very poor parenting move, very much in the AH camp. \n\nThey both lack basic communication skills and can't set or accept boundaries it seems.", "YES it IS Babysitting. He's your COUSIN. NOT your Brother. He has a different mother and does not live with you. Your COUSIN's MOTHER is responsible for his supervision & care. Not You. Your mother & aunt are using you as free childcare. Tell both of them it stops NOW. Let your mother babysit him!!", "Unless it\u2019s your kid, it\u2019s babysitting.", "You don't see it as babysitting, but she definitely sees it as free unlimited childcare.", "My parents paid me to babysit my little sister. I was definitely paid to babysit my cousins.", "Even if he was your brother you are not responsible for looking after him for hours on end, thats not a sibling expectation it's parentrification and using you.  She is responsible for organising childcare for ger child you are not responsible for providing it.", "NTA. My 13 year old and 11 year old are paid when they watch their younger brother; they also have the right to decline the offer to watch him.", "If he's not your baby, then it's babysitting. Period. Doesn't matter if it's a sibling, cousin, or friend. If the child in question is not your OWN child (step child, foster child, legal dependant), then it is called babysitting. You are being taken advantage of by both your aunt and your mother. Tell your mother to watch her nephew if \"he just sits and watches his phone,\" and it's such an easy task.", "It's worse then that..\n\nIt's how she treats you, talks about you.. LITERALLY SAID YOU ARE CAUSING HER TROUBLE. \n\nsorry, your mom is a piece of sh!t", "Explain to me again how he's your \"brother\"? It's fine that you love him and feel responsible for him, but part of the reason for that is you've been forced to. \n\nHe's not your kid, and his mother is neglecting him. \n\nNTA here. She is. And your mother is enabling her.", "He is NOT your brother, and even if he was it is NOT always your responsibility to watch him.", "She does know, she just doesn't think your life and the things you have to do are important. It's babysitting, if she's leaving her kid with you for eight hours she's saving a huuuuge amount of money on childcare.", "My parents used to pay me to mind my brother 20 years ago.", "YTA for not going to classes.\n\nThis is how life is..but you still have to go to class. \nThe drama with your Aunt and Mom may go away if you can all sit down and have a calm conversation about boundaries.\nSounds like Andy would benefit from some extra activities. Is he in soccer? Theater?\nBrother or not..this situation needs some changes made by everyone involved.\nGOODLUCK!", "[removed]", "How far do you think OP would get with your speech before she gets slapped or evicted. \ud83d\ude02", "Time to start studying at the library. and leave the house before auntie gets there.", "close cousin that OP loves like a brother, from what the post said....", "Those are your children so you can discipline them and it's your role to see to them. This child is the OP's cousin. She isn't responsible for him.", "Literally LOL at the \"reddit cares\" report on this one.  The fact that 10yos are cool is a good thing. It is not making me suicidal.", "Bad bot! Stealing from u/Wishiwashome tsk tsk", "It\u2019s also for how to think about it and draw boundaries.  And for reinforcement of what she already knows. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be a process because everyone has already staked out their extreme and entitled opinions."]}
