Even if it was your brother, you have a right to study and do whatever you need.\n\nYour aunt is his parent and she has no right to expect others to watch her kid especially so often and for so long.  \n\nWhat I would do is I would tell your mom \u201cmom I don\u2019t know why you value your sisters feelings over mine or why you think she has any right to expect that she can stop by whenever she feels like it and leave her child for really long periods of time and expect me to babysit him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am a person, I am your child, and I have a right to have a life and to study and not be expected to watch Andy. Furthermore she has a selfish view of what Andy can and can\u2019t do when she is neglecting him but expecting that he will just stay on his phone so she can go out and live her life without him.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is the one that chose to be a parent and she needs to find a babysitter or learn how to watch her own kid. Of course I feel bad saying that but the alternative is that I can\u2019t study or have a life based on whatever whim or want of hers. She is saying that her life is more important than mine and I should do whatever she wants whenever she wants without any regard for my own plans or future or welfare - and that I am somehow responsible for her own child.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurther, you are my mom and you\u2019re supposed to be protecting me not placating her. I am your child. And you are behaving as if my standing up for myself, when you should be standing up for me, is an inconvenience.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were both attempting to put me in a position of a parent and I am not anyone\u2019s parent and if you would like I\u2019ll go out and get myself pregnant so at least I\u2019ll have to watch my own kid. Even if he was my true brother and not just my close cousin, I would not be expected to watch him at all hours at any time, for eight hours in a row.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you can tell her or I will tell her that she needs to get a babysitter or figure out a different plan and that I\u2019m not going to do this. She can\u2019t keep dumping her kid on me and if you keep cooperating there will come a time when I won\u2019t have to live here anymore and you will find that I won\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t worry you\u2019ll have your sister and her child.\u201c\n\nYour aunt is truly behaving selfishly and with entitlement to your time and effort. Your mother should explain to you why she is prioritizing your aunt or why she can\u2019t babysit. \n\n\u201cMom if it\u2019s that important to you to accommodate your entitled sister than you can babysit her!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if she wants me to babysit she can make advance arrangements for a set amount of time and she\u2019s going to have to pay me for it. There\u2019s a difference between spending time and time with my cousin and constantly being forced at no notice to babysit for eight hours straight.\u201d\n\nI would not answer my door and I would tell my aunt clearly that if she drops her kid off again without your permission you\u2019re going to call the police or child protective services. \u201cI have to study so that I can get into a good college and it\u2019s unfair for you to expect this or pretend that I don\u2019t have anything better to do or to expect your small child to watch himself for eight hours because you don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to stand up for yourself, but I think you\u2019re better off having them be outraged then putting up with this treatment any longer. \n\n(also do you not have a dad or grandparents who can stick up for you?
