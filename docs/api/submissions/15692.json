I know you thought you came up with a very clever reason for living practically rent free, but you\u2019re not as smart as you think you are. Unless he bought that house when he was 15, most of his mortgage payment is interest and he\u2019s not yet building much equity. If you think contributing to his capital repayment is unfair, I suggest you contribute half of his interest payment, adjusted for any tax effect. Look at it this way. If you were renting a place together, you\u2019d probably split rent, utilities etc 50/50, so that\u2019s a fair starting point for thinking about things. Then the question becomes whether there is a good, fair reason for making adjustments to that 50/50 split.\n\nIf you two end up married, I assume you will offer to pay your half of an equity earned while you lived together before asking to have your name put on the deed.", "YTA. You won't gain any equity because you didn't invest in the house. You're not renting to buy; you're renting like you would elsewhere. Maybe the amount to pay in rent could be re-discussed if you feel it's excessive. But expecting not to pay a single penny for the roof over your head just because he owns it is ridiculous.\n\nYou want to benefit from his paying a mortgage, for free. You're the one who's being unfair and trying to take advantage of him. And paying your share of utilitie, groceries, and every other expense doesn't change the fact that you're expecting to pay zero toward housing. \n\nHe could agree if he wanted to. But he doesn't. You are entitled to decide if that impacts your relationship and how you view him. It could be that you aren't on the same page in terms of expectations of the partnership. And that's fine. But he's not an asshole for expecting you to pay something toward the place you will be living in, and you are an asshole for expecting him to give you a place to live for free.", "YTA.  You\u2019ve only been dating 10 months.  Just stay where you are with your free house .  It\u2019s not really the \u201clogical thing\u201d for you to be moving in with him yet. \n\nUnless this is some kind of agreed upon life partnership with shared finances involving savings toward shared financial goals (and it\u2019s obviously not that right now), then you should be helping out more than just groceries and utilities.   \n\nThe other question would be - if you weren\u2019t moving in, would he be renting out to someone else and you\u2019re taking up that rental space with moving in?\n\nI think you should slow roll moving in.", "YTA you want to live rent free, stay at your mom's.", "This again? \n\nYTA.\n\nAdults pay to live somewhere. You don't understand about rent because you are still dependent on your parents.\n\nMortgages are genrally cheaper than rent. \n\nLook at the running rate for renting a one bedroom apartment and then work from their. It doesn't matter what percentage of his mortgage you are paying if you are getting a screaming deal to live in an actual house.\n\nPaying utilities and groceries are things you should already pay for (at least your share).", "YTA \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re on the mortgage or not it\u2019s a part of life and responsibilities. If you don\u2019t want to pay \u201crent\u201d stay living at home with your mom but I would argue at 25 living rent free has created this issue.", "YTA. You've been living at your parents' house for free, but your boyfriend is not a parent. I think it's reasonable to expect you to pay your share of expenses, which includes housing. With that said, half of the mortgage is not necessarily a fair amount. A fair distribution would be based on what the house could be rented out for. You can look at comparable houses for rent near you on rental websites and you should pay half of what the house would rent for. That could be more or less than half of his mortgage, but probably less since it does not include equity.\n\nThere are other considerations you could reasonably bring up, such as that it is his place that he picked without your input, so presumably it meets his preferences for location, style, etc. more than yours. If you make less than him, that's another relevant factor that a lot of couples take into account when splitting expenses. It might be fair for you to pay somewhat less than half of the equivalent rent based on those factors.\n\nHowever, the bottom line is that you cannot expect to live there rent free with him paying completely for your housing.", "YTA. If you want free housing, stay with your parents. \n\nHow would you feel if it was an apartment or the mortgage was in your name only?\n\nPartners are exactly that partners. You work together to build a life. If that's not what you want break it off now.", "YTA, you're not agreeing to pay for your place of living. A relationship where one person lives rent free is unfair.", "1. You dont get equity paying rent either, which youd have to do if you didnt have your mom.\n2. its way too early to move in.

You would still be splitting the rent equally in that case as well. I don't exactly understand how him owning the place factors into this, if anything you're holding that against him.", "YTA\nIf it was a rental, I assume you wouldn't have minded paying half? But since it's his house, suddenly it's a problem. Why should he invite someone to live with him and profit from all the hard work he put into it without contributing?\nLet's say this relationship is years down the road and you either add your name to the mortgage or buy a house together, and he uses his old house to buy your new one. Is it then fair that he was the only once that's been paying for the mortgage all of these years?\n\nEven if you don't want to pay for the mortgage you should cover more of a different bill. Like paying for the whole food/utility bill instead to even out the difference.", "I think the real question is do YOU want to live with him.  If you don\u2019t, then problem solved.  If you do, then, it would be fair to give him SOME money but perhaps not 50/50.  I would research what the market rate for renting a room in this suburban area is and suggest paying no more than that.  And then even add a little discount since he\u2019s the one that wants you to move in and you\u2019d be farther from work.  Maybe that ends up being 50/50.  Maybe less.  And if you do move in with him, make sure you have a rental contract in place.  Protect yourself.", "YTA - stay home", "Yta. You have to pay rent when you live somewhere. Why don't you go get a house and let him live with you, rent free if he's got the better deal?\n\nDon't look at it like paying him, you're paying the bank that owns the joint.\n\nHere's something else - when you live together, you're not roommates. You're pooling resources. So if you don't want to pay rent and his money is going to living expenses, guess who has the disposable income to pay for dinner, holidays, furniture, house supplies, maintenance fees... That'd be you, darlin'.", "YTA marry him and buy a house if you want equity, until then you are renting him and the house.", "YTA. If you are living in a house you pay the rent.  Work out what the market rent is and have a conversation", "Depends.\n\nWhose idea was it to move in? If you're not moving in with him, are you eager to move out of your mom's place? Was he looking for a roommate? Is he tight on money? Who usually pays when you guys go out?\n\n10months is still early, he may have wanted some rent money from you (cynical view). I do think you should pay a portion, but not 50%.", "YTA. You're expecting him to provide you with housing... for free.", "YTA, you have only been together 10 months. Of course you wouldn't be treated the same financially.", "YTA sorry, but you're fighting the wrong battle. You would owe him rent. Insurance and home repairs/maintenance are fully on him, though.", "YTA\n\nYou live together, you share the expenses. The mortgage is an expense. It is absolutely insane that you think living in his house for free is the \"fair\" option. You don't gain equity by renting, either, but you still have to pay for the roof over your head.", "YTA unless half the mortgage isn\u2019t anywhere near market rate for rent in your area. If you don\u2019t want to pay rent, then continue living where you are for free. Paying for groceries is an insulting compromise if you both have similar incomes", "YTA It's only fair that you pay rent. There is nothing free in this world. You're just used to living rent free. If you want that luxury to continue then stay with your mother. If you want to move in with your bf it comes with more responsibilities. Welcome to the real world.", "If he wants you to pay rent, then he will be your landlord. You should get a rental contract. As a tenant, you have rights. In case you break up, he can't just kick you out of \"his\" house if you have a lease. \n\nI don't really get why you would want to pay some corporation's mortgage and get them equity over your boyfriend getting equity. Especially since it isn't because you can't afford it. It's not like you paid the down payment, or your credit will be ruined if the house is foreclosed on. Maybe say you won't pay half? If it's a smaller portion, does that make it alright?", "I\u2019m undecided. I think your point on equity is valid.  But the thing about money is that it\u2019s not binary.

Personally, I would recommend that your boyfriend tries to find other tenants, and you to continue living with your mom. You could keep a toothbrush and a change of clothes at your boyfriend's and sleep over a few nights a week to mimic moving in with him and cover a third of utilities or whatever but don't actually move in with him until your relationship is more solidified (esp if he still thinks you are a gold digger .-.)", "YTA.

No one needs to be at-fault or in the wrong, incompatibility is big enough of a valid reason.", "It sounds like you don't actually want to live there anyway. So... Don't. Stay at your mom's house until you can buy a place in the city. BUT... you and the BF need to decide how you will move forward eventually. (Is he going to sell his house and move to your place in the city? Once you have the money, will he sell his house and you two buy a place together? Will you buy your own place and you're just never going to live together?) It's only been 10 months, just hold your horses on the move for now.", "So don't move out.   10 months isn't very long at your age.  Stay where you are until you can buy a house.   Doesn't sound like you like the location anyway.", "I think there's always a price to pay. Right now you have the luxury of saving a lot of money by freeloading off your mom, but you're going to need to learn to be independent, and part of learning has a price. And u fortunately that price is paying rent.\n\nWith that being said, since you're not eager to move out - I don't think you should be paying 50%. But I do think you should be paying some $ for using the place, just like renting out a room. How you figure that out is up to you, could be going with the market rate of a room rental, etc. If you really don't want to, then just stay home and save your money (problem solved).", "Sure, but in her edit, she also said she would pay 3x as much in rent. So she did state she would rather pay rent somewhere else.", "Moving in with him is going to build a lot of resentment in you for him since it sounds like you hate the location so much.", ">he\u2019s the one who invited me to live with him! \n\nDo you actually want to live in his house? In your edit, you complain about the location of the house as not being as desirable for you.", "Yeah that\u2019s weird. If HE invited you to live with him, HE shouldn\u2019t be asking you to pay half of his mortgage. Especially when your other option is free\ud83d\ude02 You\u2019re not the asshole.", "\u201cHey babe, I\u2019m about to buy a house. I know you live rent free right now, but I really want you to live with me. Just give me $700 (or whatever) a month so we can make it happen\u201d Absolutely the fuck not lmfao", "In this case he should get a renters", "I agree but the OP didn\u2019t mention a current or previous tenant or the BF\u2019s desire to even rent it out to strangers. I based my answer off of the information given.\n\nIt\u2019s a new relationship and relationships come and go all the time.\n\nThe thought of paying off a boyfriend\u2019s mortgage when I\u2019m not even sure if we will marry or be together for the rest of our lives is a no for me.", ">He is more preferable as a housemate for her than some random roommate she finds online,\n\nExcept for the fact that it sounds like she can continue to live with her mom for free, so it's not like her choices are limited to just him and a random housemate online.", "Exactly. I live in a great place FOR FREE, so of course I\u2019ll compare it to a shitty place I have TO PAY to live in. Also, because I\u2019ve actually had support from my family I would be able to buy a place in this exact neighborhood in about a year\u2026", "*willing to pay for the location. She'd be willing to pay to stay in the city, not to move into the suburbs.", "The money is for use of the living spaces. How OP chooses to use it is up to him, he could use that money to pay for dates/other expenses.", "Additionally, her edit makes it sound like she doesn\u2019t even really want to live where his house is (that if they were starting from scratch, she wouldn\u2019t pick a place in the suburbs that\u2019s car dependent). I do think she should pay something, but definitely not 50/50 for a place that\u2019s not actually somewhere she would pick if they were starting from scratch. (And of course, no equity)\n\nAnd hopefully she stops having to pay for the majority of their dates.", "Not sure why everyone is hating on your stance. If you were improving your living situation (i.e. closer to work, safer neighborhood, bigger space) then yes, you should pay to live with your boyfriend. However, if you gain nothing from living at his place other than companionship, then you shouldn't have to pay. \n\nYou are moving to this place FOR him. Companionship goes both ways. He is benefitting from you being there too. \n\nI'd suggest you don't move in with him quite yet. Wait until he proposes or get married first. This arrangement is a fast-track to be his rent-paying- bang-maid-forever-girlfriend out of his convenience.", "Okay, so stay at home another year and buy your own place. That's fine. Then, if he still wants to live with you, he can move in and you can decide whether or not to charge him. That's a valid choice you can make.\n\nIt doesn't make you less of TA in this situation, though. I don't think you fully grasp what a privileged situation you're in.", "Okay. She is still paying for a place to live without getting equity while enriching someone else, most probably someone who is already rich. \n\nShe stated her problem with paying part of her boyfriend's mortgage was because she wouldn't get equity. If her problem was that she would be forced to move to an area she dislikes and she was making a sacrifice to live with him, then that should have been the focus of the post. I felt the focus was on not getting any benefit from paying into someone else's house."]}
