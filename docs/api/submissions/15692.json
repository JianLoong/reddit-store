I know you thought you came up with a very clever reason for living practically rent free, but you\u2019re not as smart as you think you are. Unless he bought that house when he was 15, most of his mortgage payment is interest and he\u2019s not yet building much equity. If you think contributing to his capital repayment is unfair, I suggest you contribute half of his interest payment, adjusted for any tax effect. Look at it this way. If you were renting a place together, you\u2019d probably split rent, utilities etc 50/50, so that\u2019s a fair starting point for thinking about things. Then the question becomes whether there is a good, fair reason for making adjustments to that 50/50 split.\n\nIf you two end up married, I assume you will offer to pay your half of an equity earned while you lived together before asking to have your name put on the deed.", "YTA. You won't gain any equity because you didn't invest in the house. You're not renting to buy; you're renting like you would elsewhere. Maybe the amount to pay in rent could be re-discussed if you feel it's excessive. But expecting not to pay a single penny for the roof over your head just because he owns it is ridiculous.\n\nYou want to benefit from his paying a mortgage, for free. You're the one who's being unfair and trying to take advantage of him. And paying your share of utilitie, groceries, and every other expense doesn't change the fact that you're expecting to pay zero toward housing. \n\nHe could agree if he wanted to. But he doesn't. You are entitled to decide if that impacts your relationship and how you view him. It could be that you aren't on the same page in terms of expectations of the partnership. And that's fine. But he's not an asshole for expecting you to pay something toward the place you will be living in, and you are an asshole for expecting him to give you a place to live for free.", "YTA.  You\u2019ve only been dating 10 months.  Just stay where you are with your free house .  It\u2019s not really the \u201clogical thing\u201d for you to be moving in with him yet. \n\nUnless this is some kind of agreed upon life partnership with shared finances involving savings toward shared financial goals (and it\u2019s obviously not that right now), then you should be helping out more than just groceries and utilities.   \n\nThe other question would be - if you weren\u2019t moving in, would he be renting out to someone else and you\u2019re taking up that rental space with moving in?\n\nI think you should slow roll moving in.", "YTA you want to live rent free, stay at your mom's.", "This again? \n\nYTA.\n\nAdults pay to live somewhere. You don't understand about rent because you are still dependent on your parents.\n\nMortgages are genrally cheaper than rent. \n\nLook at the running rate for renting a one bedroom apartment and then work from their. It doesn't matter what percentage of his mortgage you are paying if you are getting a screaming deal to live in an actual house.\n\nPaying utilities and groceries are things you should already pay for (at least your share).", "YTA \n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re on the mortgage or not it\u2019s a part of life and responsibilities. If you don\u2019t want to pay \u201crent\u201d stay living at home with your mom but I would argue at 25 living rent free has created this issue.", "YTA. You've been living at your parents' house for free, but your boyfriend is not a parent. I think it's reasonable to expect you to pay your share of expenses, which includes housing. With that said, half of the mortgage is not necessarily a fair amount. A fair distribution would be based on what the house could be rented out for. You can look at comparable houses for rent near you on rental websites and you should pay half of what the house would rent for. That could be more or less than half of his mortgage, but probably less since it does not include equity.\n\nThere are other considerations you could reasonably bring up, such as that it is his place that he picked without your input, so presumably it meets his preferences for location, style, etc. more than yours. If you make less than him, that's another relevant factor that a lot of couples take into account when splitting expenses. It might be fair for you to pay somewhat less than half of the equivalent rent based on those factors.\n\nHowever, the bottom line is that you cannot expect to live there rent free with him paying completely for your housing.", "YTA. If you want free housing, stay with your parents. \n\nHow would you feel if it was an apartment or the mortgage was in your name only?\n\nPartners are exactly that partners. You work together to build a life. If that's not what you want break it off now.", "YTA, you're not agreeing to pay for your place of living. A relationship where one person lives rent free is unfair.", "1. You dont get equity paying rent either, which youd have to do if you didnt have your mom.\n2. its way too early to move in.

You would still be splitting the rent equally in that case as well. I don't exactly understand how him owning the place factors into this, if anything you're holding that against him.", "YTA\nIf it was a rental, I assume you wouldn't have minded paying half? But since it's his house, suddenly it's a problem. Why should he invite someone to live with him and profit from all the hard work he put into it without contributing?\nLet's say this relationship is years down the road and you either add your name to the mortgage or buy a house together, and he uses his old house to buy your new one. Is it then fair that he was the only once that's been paying for the mortgage all of these years?\n\nEven if you don't want to pay for the mortgage you should cover more of a different bill. Like paying for the whole food/utility bill instead to even out the difference.", "I think the real question is do YOU want to live with him.  If you don\u2019t, then problem solved.  If you do, then, it would be fair to give him SOME money but perhaps not 50/50.  I would research what the market rate for renting a room in this suburban area is and suggest paying no more than that.  And then even add a little discount since he\u2019s the one that wants you to move in and you\u2019d be farther from work.  Maybe that ends up being 50/50.  Maybe less.  And if you do move in with him, make sure you have a rental contract in place.  Protect yourself.", "YTA - stay home", "Yta. You have to pay rent when you live somewhere. Why don't you go get a house and let him live with you, rent free if he's got the better deal?\n\nDon't look at it like paying him, you're paying the bank that owns the joint.\n\nHere's something else - when you live together, you're not roommates. You're pooling resources. So if you don't want to pay rent and his money is going to living expenses, guess who has the disposable income to pay for dinner, holidays, furniture, house supplies, maintenance fees... That'd be you, darlin'.", "YTA marry him and buy a house if you want equity, until then you are renting him and the house.", "YTA. If you are living in a house you pay the rent.  Work out what the market rent is and have a conversation", "Depends.\n\nWhose idea was it to move in? If you're not moving in with him, are you eager to move out of your mom's place? Was he looking for a roommate? Is he tight on money? Who usually pays when you guys go out?\n\n10months is still early, he may have wanted some rent money from you (cynical view). I do think you should pay a portion, but not 50%.", "YTA. You're expecting him to provide you with housing... for free.", "YTA, you have only been together 10 months. Of course you wouldn't be treated the same financially.", "YTA sorry, but you're fighting the wrong battle. You would owe him rent. Insurance and home repairs/maintenance are fully on him, though.", "YTA\n\nYou live together, you share the expenses. The mortgage is an expense. It is absolutely insane that you think living in his house for free is the \"fair\" option. You don't gain equity by renting, either, but you still have to pay for the roof over your head.", "YTA unless half the mortgage isn\u2019t anywhere near market rate for rent in your area. If you don\u2019t want to pay rent, then continue living where you are for free. Paying for groceries is an insulting compromise if you both have similar incomes", "YTA It's only fair that you pay rent. There is nothing free in this world. You're just used to living rent free. If you want that luxury to continue then stay with your mother. If you want to move in with your bf it comes with more responsibilities. Welcome to the real world.", "If he wants you to pay rent, then he will be your landlord. You should get a rental contract. As a tenant, you have rights. In case you break up, he can't just kick you out of \"his\" house if you have a lease. \n\nI don't really get why you would want to pay some corporation's mortgage and get them equity over your boyfriend getting equity. Especially since it isn't because you can't afford it. It's not like you paid the down payment, or your credit will be ruined if the house is foreclosed on. Maybe say you won't pay half? If it's a smaller portion, does that make it alright?", "I\u2019m undecided. I think your point on equity is valid.  But the thing about money is that it\u2019s not binary. Why didn\u2019t you make your equity point and say \u201chow about 40%\u201d or whatever the equity equivalent would work out to in your mind?", "NAH I understand both sides of this situation but moving in with him doesn't really benefit you at all. Personally, I would recommend that your boyfriend tries to find other tenants, and you to continue living with your mom. You could keep a toothbrush and a change of clothes at your boyfriend's and sleep over a few nights a week to mimic moving in with him and cover a third of utilities or whatever but don't actually move in with him until your relationship is more solidified (esp if he still thinks you are a gold digger .-.)", "YTA. You gotta pay some kind of rent. If you don\u2019t like it, stay home.", "YTA.

If you don\u2019t want to live there, *don\u2019t.* He\u2019ll either never want to sell his house and you\u2019ll be stuck there, or he\u2019ll feel more like exploring somewhere new, with you, in the future.", "Yea this is the way. Pay all utilities and groceries and let him pay the mortgage.", "Agree. Op is very much YTA. And immature and entitled. Honestly what\u2019s fairest is to ignore the mortgage amount all together. The mortgage is a factor of how much he paid as down payment, interest rates, his credit risk, and other irrelevant factors. Instead they should Rresearch rental rates for a similar house in that neighborhood, and she pays half of that amount. Plus half of utilities, groceries, and other expenses. He has the mortgage and he bears all the financial risk on the property. He pays 100% of all upkeep, repairs and renovations. She gets not a penny back when she moves out (which she inevitably will), because it\u2019s his house. If I\u2019m wrong and they get married in 5 years, he can redo the deed to the house and the mortgage and get her name added to both (but not just one or the other).", "Exactly. The boyfriend is delusional and a hypocrite. He likely just wants her to move in for the wrong reasons.", "Yep! Broke men are the only ones tossing around gold digger accusations. OP has an inheritance & significant personal savings! Why would she be using him to go live in a suburban 3 bedroom with 90s kitchen cabinets? Pleeease.", "Not sure how this is relevant, but we used to take turns.", "Of course she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s had everything handed to her her entire life so far.", "Bingo. This is not a positive move for her.", "Pretty sure he counted on OP doing his chores as well on top of paying half of his mortgage \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I would, too.\n\nReasons:  \n\\- The place would be only my own. When you move in with somebody it sometimes happens that the place doesn't feel like yours, sometimes there isn't even enough storage space for you (happened to me)  \n\\- Principle - I wouldn't want a landlord dynamic with my partner, and would rather pay more to a stranger than having this toxic dynamic with a boyfriend", "If it\u2019s not relevant, then why did you bring it up in the first place?", "Not relevant when he pays but completely relevant when you do. Yea YTA", "Don't move in, you've only been dating 10 months, and you don't want to.", "Then dump him and buy your own place", "So don\u2019t move in with him. would", ">rent-paying-bang-maid\n\nThis has not gotten nearly enough credit \ud83d\udc80"]}
