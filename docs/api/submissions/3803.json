Medical appointments can be scary, embarrassing, anxiety-inducing and all those other negative feelings. She may not be comfortable having her dad with her at the appointments - personally I know I'd rather have my mum than my dad, just because my dad wouldn't be comforting for me.

Is he expecting you to manage his blood sugar when you say he needs his insulin or food?", "NTA - Your child feels more comfortable with you taking them to the doctor appointments and that is important. I think husband is being unreasonable and probably even a little selfish by not understanding this. Also, to clarify a thing with this. Medical appointments are a lot more intimate than hair, nail, lashes, etc. She's trusting you with her medical knowledge and doesn't seem to feel comfortable sharing that aspect of herself with her other family.", "NTA you are scheduling needed medical appointments for your teenage daughter.", "NTA. Possibly a victim of codependency--feeling  like you have to please everyone so much that you're forgetting your daughter comes first.\n\nYour husband sounds really selfish.", "NTA\n\nI would suggest you finding out why she isn't as content with her father and/ or step mom taking her to those appointments.  Just to ensure there isn't a bigger problem here where she is only getting her well being looked after by you (hair and nails are fun and all, but there absolutely more to keeping a kids healthy, as you well know).  \n\nAs for your husband.  He needs earplugs and to remember that he married you with your kid already a part of your life.  Her in your life is a permanent thing not something he gets to pick and choose when it's convent for him.\n\nAbout thr dogs.  Have you tried a routine, especially with the separation anxiety one) that makes you leaving easier on them?  It's time to look at training them to be calm and not stressed when your gone.  There are a lot of great resources online for dealing with eparation anxiety, but you may want to look into getting a trainer as well.  One of my favorite tips to help with separation anxiety is having a special treat or toy that is reserved for ONLY when you are gone.  For a food motivated pup  freeze some peanut butter in a Kong toy.  This can lead to hours of content focus where they are getting happy rewards as they play and lick their toy.  For less food motivated dogs there are all kinds of busy toys that can be used.  You can start implementing this in short bursts.\n\nGive toy or treat and walk out the door.  After you close the door immediately open it and walk back in and pick up the toy. Do this a dozen times or so.  Let them associate leaving with coming back.  When that is successful start increasing the time from closing the door and going back in.  Then when you can go a minute or two go fir a short walk and come back.  Then going fr a short drive.  Seriously. Build up the time you can be away with your pup knowing you will be home.  Do it as frequently as possible to help build up the pup's confidence that you are returning and everything is OK.  Don't make a fuss over walking out the door.  Give the toy or treat and simply leave.  That's it.  No \"bye puppy\" no baby talk.  Put the toy or treat away from the door (preferably where the dog can't see you keave) and just walk out.  Then when you come in you can pet and reassure them when they've been calm.  \"What a good puppy you've been!\"\n\nWorking from home your pup hasn't built that connection that you are coming back because there isn't the routine of leave and return retracing that in their brain.  So help the pup see the routine and build on the success.  It will take time but you'll end up with a more secure and confident pup and your husband won't be so bothered by a dog that can't handle not having you there. Win for everyone", "NTA. Obviously your daughter feels much more comfortable having her mom there for the important stuff. I'm sorry your husband gets woken up by the dog but does he expect you to never leave the house if he's sleeping? Also, it's not your responsibility to get him food or meds. He's a grown man.", "NTA.  Balancing all of the daily variables is a challenge that you are trying to manage to the benefit of everyone.   It can't be done.  It seems to me that husband should be included in the supervision of your daughter.  He could take her to some of her appointments.  Daughter doesn't need to be the one to choose her driver.  Dogs barking while husband is asleep can be reduced by adding doggie hemp to their diets.   Prepackaged snacks to combat diabetic lows can be placed into the top drawer of his nightstand.  Perhaps these ideas will be helpful.", "NTA.  You know your child's history and can best see that she receives continuity in her care. Your husband sounds like he just wants you to be at his beck and call and coddle him. If you did what he wants, you would be letting his weaponized incompetence take precedence over your daughter's medical care.", "NTA you are a great mom but you need to get your dog training.", "NTA\n\nYou and your daughter's relationship is obviously pretty good in that she actually wants you to go with her to everything.  She may be uncomfortable with her step-mom or father taking her to some of these appointments.\n\nYour husband married you with a child in your life that you still had to parent, which includes appointments.  \n\nSince the dog is the main issue, maybe look into some more formalized training to get the dog over its issues.  Being a diabetic is not an excuse to be upset.  Unless his sugar is down under 50, he should be able to address his crash issues.  \n\nYour doing your best....hopefully it will get better.", "nta but I think you have a great idea for compromise between your husband and daughter's wants/needs. Have a convo with your daughter about whether its cool if she only does the important (i.e. therapy, doctor) appointments with you and does the things like hair or nails while at her dads.", "NTA. This is not about your husband. This is about your daughters comfort and she clearly chooses you.", "NTA. Your are her mother. Could her Dad help? Of course! However, you know he won't and your daughter is asking for you specifically. You are just following through like a responsible parent.  Your husband is being unreasonable.", "NTA\n\nHusband needs a Dexcom 6.  It'll monitor his sugar and you can set the alarm for at level he needs to get his ass up and grab a snack before he crashes.  It has a \"follower\" app that allows up to 10 people to see his readings in real time as well.\n\nI don't have anything for the dogs, sorry.", "NTA \n\nMaking sure your daughter's medical needs are handled is responsible parenting. It sounds as though she has multiple reasons to be more comfortable with you for those so unfortunately your husband will have to look into other solutions.", "NAH, but perhaps it\u2019s time to share the burden.", "Esh. Listen to your current husband. Bio dad and step mom could help out more instead of being the fun parents. Perhaps, husband could use noise machine, ear plugs or move the dogs into his room when he sleeps so they know someone is nearby.", "I don't think you're an AH here, but, you do need to stop this.  Stop asking your daughter who she wants to take her to the doctor and work out a schedule with your ex and his wife.  TELL her who's taking her and when, and why if necessary.  Bring your dogs with you when you can.  You don't have to wait in the waiting room.  You could be walking the dogs near the car.  It's tough enough to have to work the night shift without being completely sleep deprived.", "Yta....despite how lacking he is you need to discuss this with the ex so its not always on you....daughter might not like it but you shouldn't be the only one to know all of kids nedical info....what if you were out of state and couldn't get back for kids in an emergency...he needs to be able to handle his kids info as well....sorry but yeah this needs to be squared away.

I can\u2019t really fault your husband for not loving the way her dad isn\u2019t stepping up for some of them. I understand the comments saying your husband is a grown man who can take care of himself but I have a partner that works night shift and it honestly takes the whole house being considerate of their schedule for them to get good sleep.

They're around $40.", "Takes one to know one, I guess.", "I'm glad he's a good step dad and they have a great relationship. It really sounds like if you can get to the point where you are able to leave without dog chaos he will be able to manage much better.  I can understand how stressful it must be for him to not get a good day's sleep when he works at night.  Remember how exhausted you were with a baby unable to sleep through the night?  That meant you were unable to sleep through the night.  He's experiencing that now but with a teenager.  Yes he absolutely needs to buck up and understand these appointments are a requirement.  If her dad cant/ won't do them you need to.  But he's upset at the wrong person (you being responsible instead of the other half of her parents not being responsible).   So work with the dogs and I'm sure it will be a LOT easier for him to accept your needing to take care of things for your daughter to ensure her well being.  \n\nIn the mean time while the dog is still being worked with.  Consider if you can take the dog or if there is a puppy day care near you.  The socialization is good for pups anyway and would get them out of your husband's ears while you're making progress with their separation eanxiety (this can also help with that because a socialized dog tend to be more comfortable and confident to begin with.  Especially if they've had time to get their energy (physical as well as mental) out before working on training.  A tired dog is a good dog!)", "2 quick responses:\n\nFor the medical appointments, you should take her, but also in many cases, your husband should be able to take her because no one but her and the doctor should be in the room for privacy reasons. That being said, not all appointments are equal along those lines so those that are \u201cnon-essential\u201d or lower impact should probably be pushed off onto the ex\u2026", "I know you have to pick your battles, but hair, nail and lashes appointments, are mostly not necessary and should be scheduled to times where your husband is awake. \n\nAs for the other appointments, slowly move towards scheduling them 50/50. Don\u2019t ask your daughter what she wants just do it. \n\nI love dogs, but maybe the puppy isn\u2019t a good fit for your family. You should teach it not to bark when you leave. It is of course more difficult because you work from home, but it\u2019s you and your husbands responsibility to do the job.", "So true! We need fun time too! \n\nAnd I am definitely glad that they are comfortable and happy at both houses. But this has been a good reminder! Thank you!", "Maybe explain to her that you are concerned as to WHY she doesn't want him to take her and you want to make sure everything is OK. \n\nOnce you can finally get a why out of her I think you can better determine how to handle the appointment thing and whether you should keep taking her or help her work through her why's so that her dad can start taking her to these appointments", "I have definitely glazed over this potential issue and just let it happen. I don\u2019t know why she doesn\u2019t want him there. Sometimes I wonder if she just doesn\u2019t feel \u2018wanted\u2019 for lack of a better word. My ex is my son\u2019s bff and hockey coach and spends tons of time with him. When she was younger I don Mr think she realized how the dynamics were. But now that she\u2019s older, it\u2019s probably pretty obvious.", "Sounds like a fantastic Christmas gift!!!! Thank you!", "I have this headband, and I love it! I also have noise canceling ear buds. I have worked third for the last 17 years and do just fine with those. My daughter and granddaughter live with me, and I don\u2019t expect them to tip toe everywhere while I sleep. NTA, and you are a good mom.", "Sweet! Looks like he\u2019s getting this and a noise canceling headband for Christmas! Thank you!", "Ahhhh yeah that could be a reason. Again, ultimately it will be between those two, but without some kind of nudge they may never work to resolve that.\n\nDepending on how perceptive dad is he may not even realize she's uncomfortable with him and may just wave all the appointments you take her to as \"ok, her mom has her, I don't need to worry about this\". \n\nEveryone just skimming over it may contribute to this lasting. Might be worth a poke just to make sure. Just approach it reasonably from a \"hey, it's OK to feel how you feel, I'm not judging or trying to be overbearing, just want to make sure everything is ok and talk through it\". That's entirely on you on whether or not to poke.\n\nOverall good luck OP"]}
