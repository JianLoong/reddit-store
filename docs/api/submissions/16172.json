And I guess after you bought it, you still could have broken it in half and offered that to her, if she had been nice about the whole thing.\n\nAlso, since it's a chain, couldn't she have gone to another one (or called them) to see if they had more chocolate coconut donuts?", "NTA\n\nUnless that kid was literally standing there (which considering mum was coming from work doesn\u2019t sound like it), there was no kid. \n\nWay too many details in her opening statement.
