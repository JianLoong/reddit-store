You don\u2019t owe someone a justification for not wanting to go on a date with them, even if they are the gender you are attracted to. No is a complete sentence. She knows you are gay, has sidestepped that and implied she could change that if you just gave her a chance (which is gross and homophobic), she is handling rejection like a child and now that her brother asked you out she is throwing a tantrum and blocking you?

NTA.", "I was going to say N A H until her reaction. You didn\u2019t break her heart. Her fantasy of what she thought she could turn you into broke her heart. Solid NTA.", "Nta. She knows your gay. She needs to get over herself. Maybe she feels she is so pretty she should be able to have anyone she wants.", "NTA. Girl asks out gay guy and gets rejected. I know that woman tend to have less experience dealing with romantic rejection than men do and so when it does happen a good outcome doesn't always happen. Unfortunately, this situation was definitely stacked against her.\n\nThere is something I would like to explore here.\n\n>She\u2019s been trying to convince me to give girls a shot since I never have before & I\u2019ve teased that I was open to trying (my mistake).\n\nThis here is problematic. She has been challenging your sexuality. This is no different than a straight man claiming a woman isn't fully gay because she's never tried a guy before. Your response doesn't shut her down. However, the argument can be made that your return was in a joking nature since her inquiry is disrespectful if it was serious. Thus maybe you interpreted it as a joke in the moment but now looking back you realize she had a goal.\n\nNow on to her blaming.\n\n>she told him I broke her heart?\n\nShe asked out a gay man and got rejected. I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt that you did not stringing her along as some others have accused you of in other comments. I would like to call back my above point of her challenging your sexuality. That is again not okay and so if you interpreted it as a playful joke amongst friends then I get it. There's the joke that nothing is gayer that a heterosexual male group chat, because of the way they talk to each other and jokes being made in a comfortable environment. My interpretation is that these advancements were assumed to be not serious or at least in humor first and foremost.\n\nThen again, even if you were open to being with a woman, it doesn't guarantee she makes the list. Individuals who are attracted to more than a single gender can have drastic differences in their preferences. A bisexual woman might like masc women and femme men or femme woman and masc men. She might even prefer androgyny across the board. Regardless, her inquiry has two outcomes: yes or no. It does not matter what the probability is for either outcomes, there is still two outcomes. She should have known that she would either be accepted or rejected. Her actions suggest to me that she assumed the latter was an impossibility.\n\nI think the final angle to examine should be the ethics of dating her brother. She does not get to claim you. That is not how relationships work. You rejected an advancement you did not want, and accepted one you did want. With this in mind I would say you are in the clear. Her brother might have issue with dating someone his sister is so adamantly against him dating, but it does feel like this aggression might burn out once she finds someone else. At this point the ball is in his court if he wants to deal with this drama. She doesn't really get to have a say on who her brother dates. She's angry because she also likes you, but her brother is the one who gets to wine and dine you.\n\nThis feels no different than other situations of \"My friend likes a girl but got rejected and then she asked me out and I said yes. AITA.\" Nine times out of ten these get NTA verdicts. The only thing that looks to be swaying yours is the \"I\u2019ve teased that I was open to trying (my mistake)\", but I am interpreting this as a response to a inquire you assumed as a joke.", "He \"teased that he was open to trying\" being straight..... She didn't pull that card...", "Lol maybe that's the closure she needs\n\nThough I'd rather call it a shot through the heart. She gives love a bad name", "> This can be perceived as leading her on.\n\nBarely leading on. If you open with you're gay the other person shouldn't have very high hopes of anything happening. Plus, you're allowed to say one comment that may indicate someone has a chance of dating you, but you can still say No. \n\nNothing ever obligates you to date someone.", "that\u2019s fair, thanks", "[deleted]", "she knew he was gay OP is not the asshole here", "But saying he\u2019s open to trying is different than saying I\u2019m interested in and would be open to trying it you specifically. I think the sister read into it too much because she had on her blinders on and only heard what she wanted. But NTA. unfortunate situation for all but we all have to learn to accept the word no.", "Except she did. He says that she had been trying to convince him to give girls a shot since he never had", "That's usually how it works", "He teased her he was open to trying, clearly she took that seriously", "He knew she was interested in him and told her that he was interested in trying with women, how else is she supposed to take that? \n\nHe's not an asshole for not wanting to go out with her but he has played with her a bit because he was probably flattered which isn't a nice thing to do.", "\"He \"teased that he was open to trying\" being straight..... She didn't pull that card...\"\n\n\nNo.... HE teased it.... She didn't....", ">She\u2019s been trying to convince me to give girls a shot since I never have before & I\u2019ve teased that I was open to trying (my mistake)\n\nCare to read the whole sentence?", "He sounds pretty young, he was probably uncomfortable and trying to diffuse the situation. He\u2019s not the asshole. She certainly is", "From what I understand he teased to it after she had been trying to convince him to try.  I've been wrong before though, so maybe you're right.", "I read the post twice actually, just because OP admits his mistake here doesn't change the way it was perceived by her", "She tried... He lied....\n\n\nSo why is she the AH and not him?", "this is actually exactly what i was doing \ud83d\ude05 she\u2019s brought it up many times over the months & i thought if i jokingly said that i might give it a try one day she would back off from it. but i understand it can seem like i was leading her on so i\u2019m not mad at people saying im in the wrong for that", "She believed she could somehow \"convert\" him despite knowing he's gay, the teasing on his part was stupid but it did not make her perceive anything other than what she already wanted to believe.", "Good question. Why would she ask him out if she didn't think she had a chance?", "Funny how you framed it this way. One tried but the other lied, her as the passionate one and him as the deceiving one. \n\n\"She tried\". Nope. She knew he was gay and kept on bothering him to like/date her, believing she was special and could bend him straight. That's definitely not just trying, that's at best being annoying and at worst harassing. \n\n\"He lied\". He's stupid for not directly and immediately turning her down instead of pulling a dumb prank. \n\n>So why is she the AH and not him\n\nBecause she's the stubborn one bothering him despite knowing his sexual orientation while his stupid lie, despite being stupid, was not why she was so determined to \"convert\" him as she's made multiple \"tries\" already.", "Funny how you assume that she tried before he joked about being open.....", ">She\u2019s been trying to convince me to give girls a shot since I never have before & I\u2019ve teased that I was open to trying (my mistake).\n\nI interpreted what OP wrote.\n\n>she\u2019s brought it up many times over the months & i thought if i jokingly said that i might give it a try one day she would back off from it.\n\nAnd I was correct.\n\nCare to explain why you framed him as the only bad guy here?", "Because your second quote from OP was was 16 minutes ago..... And my comment was made on the ORIGINAL \"I've teased that I was open\" quote?\n\n\nSorry I wasn't omniscient....", ">Sorry I wasn't omniscient....\n\nSo I'm omniscient huh? Your comment was based on the unlikely thought that a gay guy would randomly joke that he's open to girls to a girl he made friends with a few months ago. Pretty neutral and unbiased of you I must say."]}
