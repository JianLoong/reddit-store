Considering the **very** high disparity in incomes, you may offer to put in a bit more for little extras or emergencies here and there.\n\nYou have children with other people. Your financial obligations are not only to yourselves. If a man in 2023 cannot understand why a woman, with previous children no less, would want to maintain a level of financial separation in a marriage without taking it personally, I think that's a pretty big cause for concern.\n\nMy generous interpretation: your fiancee feels insecure about his financial position relative to yours, and rather than process that insecurity, he thinks it's a better idea to give him full access to all of your money because of... love?\n\nmy ungenerous interpretation: your fiancee has not made this an issue in your relationship because he expected to have full access to all of your money when you got married and did not want to jeopardize that.\n\nEither way, his resorting to \"if you loved me / if you were ready to get married\" is a totally uncool manipulation tactic. He's trying to guilt you into giving him all of your money. That's fucked up, and if he can't drop that toute suite and have a real conversation with you, I don't see this ending well.

Your decisions regarding finances need to consider the long term ability to meet those obligations, and to protect your individual interests as well.\n\nI actually think you're being to generous in your offer.  I would recommend that you each have your paychecks deposited into individual accounts and the transfer a share for household expenses into a joint account, with all expenses being split 50/50 except rent/mortgage being proportional based on income.\n\nAlso, in such a complicated situation, post divorce, with dependents, and a disparate income, you should NOT sign any wedding license without a really good prenup.

Although it wouldn't be a an identical amount, it would be a fair amount.

Access to your income means that he will be free to spend your income however he wants on stuff for his kids, including using your income to pay child support (if they are young enough that he has child support he has to pay) and other goodies he might want to buy for his kids that he cannot currently afford on his own income. \n\nWith him having access to, and control of, your income, he may also get upset at how much money you spent on your own child and for your own mother.", "Prenup", "NTA you are a blended family both on your SECOND family and you both have a financial responsibility to things outside this relationship.\n\nHonestly I would seek counseling BEFORE you are legally bound this isn't an issue you can go into a marriage with and expect it to work out.

This makes the most financial sense, as the interest on our mortgage is minimised (the account is a revolving credit account). The only other accounts we maintain is our own independant credit cards.  We pay our credit cards off in full every month, through the joint account - we just use the interest free period to reduce the mortgage interest.  Anyway, we use those cards for presents, surprises....etc for our partner, so we can keep some things secret.  \nFor a while after we were bought our house I also used to keep a spreadsheet that divided everything up, so that if we ever did have to split everything up, we could actually work out whose share was whose (his income was more than mine, but i contributed more to the deposit, so this just made us both feel fairer about the situation of merging accounts).  I have stopped doing the spreadsheet - although I could reconstruct it if needed.  My husband wanted me to do that sooner, but let that go as that made me more comfortable.  \nI agree that flipping a coin on approach to take is not the way to go. It would seem to me that you need to negotiate a compromise that you can both live with.  A coin flip means you start off with one person \"winning\" and the other \"losing\", and sets a precident that there is no discussion needed to come to a viewpoint that is mutually agreeable when situations like this come up.", "NTA. Having some funding outside of a household budget as YOUR discretionary fund for something you just want for yourself isn't a bad thing. Also, like you said, for surprises. You buy something from your joint account, spouse knows about it up front. But from your own private account, a gift for your partner just pops up and they can't trace your plans for anniversary, birthday, xmas, etc. As long as it works for your budget, it shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA - he's essentially suggesting that you flip a coin to see if you get married. That's ridiculous.", "NTA. Separate savings are peace of mind. Plus a nice way to buy surprise presents. Married and have separate savings. Plus joint savings.

Looking back, that was obviously my own insecurity talking and I made a me-problem into a we-problem by not clocking how my feelings were clouding what should have been a practicalities discussion. We eventually ended up pooling all of our money and it's never been an issue, but I view the matter entirely different now that I've lived some more life. \n\nWhile I sympathize with your fiance since I've been there, done that, felt that - he's being a giant prick. His refusal to consider a compromise and the way he's questioning your commitment if you don't bend to his wishes are concerning.", "NTA. His unwillingness to even discuss financial independence is a HUGE red flag. Getting married isn't some magic balm for potential future problems. His hard line on this would have me reconsidering the relationship. At a minimum, I'd definitely get a prenup (and possibly a financial advisor) if you think this is recoverable.\n\nI've been married over 20 years and we have no joint accounts beyond mortgages.", "I earn 5x what my husband does and very happily for 20yrs we have kept separate accounts but put a proportion of our salaries into one joint account for bills.

Seriously, do not be blind, what are you doing with your life?", "NTA my husband and I have a shared investment account but otherwise we just pick different bills to cover and don\u2019t have shared finances at all. We didn\u2019t start dating till our 30s and the idea of having to explain a target purchase or something seems absurd to me.

It has occurred to me that 10% of your income that you would be saving is substantially more than 10% of his savings and to me that is entirely fair and reasonable. I would be truly concerned at what is underlying his thinking, I suspect it is something very unpleasant.\n\nYou both are not terribly young, nor are either of you responsibility free. There should be a certain level of pragmatism about finances at this point. You both have true financial and lifestyle commitments towards your offspring. Have you discussed in detail these commitments? School fees? Inheritance? \n\nLook, bottom line is that it really does sound that he wants 100% access to your entire income and assets. While that maybe practical to a couple that is just starting out and will be building those assets together, making joint decisions around career building, employment opportunity and lifestyle, that is not the case with your relationship.  There is a certain level of decisions that need to be made around practicality and protection, not only for common sense reasons but also to protect your child\u2019s future.\n\nHave you considered getting a third objection opinion on this? Bringing in a professional (either financial or legal) representative to review and propose ways forward would ensure that there is a decent and fair foundation for your marriage. It would also protect all of your children and frankly flag any potential underlying issues.  Somehow I\u2019m getting the feeling he would object to the scrutiny though.", "NAH.

I didn\u2019t not realize 10% would be a deal breaker.", "His reasoning is that people in marriages that have independent accounts are more likely to want to jump ship, leave the marriage, as they have that safety boat.
