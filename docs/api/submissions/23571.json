Now bit of background, they had their son via a surrogate in Ukraine. The only reason they went to Ukraine for was because it was the cheapest place to get a White surrogate mother.  \nMy brother in law\u2019s partner (call him Tom) is much older and is kind of a racist. He basically would say that surrogates from Latin America would end up producing sicklier babies, saying their wombs aren\u2019t adept for birthing larger European skulls and the more he talked the ickier it got. That their diets and habits weren\u2019t ideal. He said that if money wasn\u2019t an option he would have a Swedish woman carry his child as they have Viking blood. The whole thing was really icky and I never liked this guy.  \nSo they have the baby, everyone in the family is happy and for the longest time they never talked about the Ukranian surrogate, in fact it was a sore spot. Joe would constantly say if he could get pregnant he would have carried him himself.  \nBut now, after the war happened they started telling everyone how their son is Ukrainian (son has no Ukrainian DNA just was in an Ukrainian womb). They spam everyone in the family with this war stuff. At my wedding Joe took the microphone and started crying and giving a speech about the war.  \nBack to current time: these guys wanted to go to Disney World and asked if they could crash at our place as we live in Orlando. My wife and I have just have a 2 bedroom apartment but since they are family we said sure. They were set to stay for a week.  \nAll was good, however then they tried guilting me into paying for their vacation, saying that me helping pay for the vacation is like helping out refugees. I told them no, and they just kept hounding me for stuff, be like oh Timmy (fake name for son) really would like to go to Star Wars its his dream but the tickets are so expensive. I told them no but again kept hounding me, and if they got a no from me they would beg my wife.  \nI just put up up with it, until one day when I was going to work I realized that there was a giant bumper sticker on my car. And it said \u201cF\\*\\*\\* Russia\u201d with an Ukrainian flag on it. I knew it was one of them that did it, I got so annoyed as I just got my new car. I told them that they need to find a hotel for the rest of the time here as they have overstayed their welcome. They started saying that they were just trying to do the right thing, and increase awareness. They start talking about how they are already in credit card debt, and I told them I don\u2019t care. They now are telling people in my family that I am secretly a Putin apologist because of this.", "created_utc": 1690819846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ekead/aita_for_kicking_out_my_brother_in_law_his/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why on earth would they come to family's house and be such asses like this? My family went to DW back in March, and everything was scheduled, planned, and paid for months in advance. Did they just show up without any actual planning at all?!", "NTA -  But your brother in law and his husband sure are! What is happening to the people in the Ukraine is just tragic, the damage that this is brought to innocent citizens is heartbreaking. The fact that these two are capitalizing on this when it is NOTHING that touches their son, other than the person who carried him is from there is awful.  Especially when there is no mention of his surrogate or concern for the woman who provided the womb so that they could be parents.  If the kiddo had been adopted from the Ukraine as a young child and there was still existing family over there to be concerned about, then that would be different, but in their case they are taking advantage of the suffering of others to benefit themselves which is MAJOR ICK!\n\nI will say this, the sins of the parents are not that of the child.  So remember that the son is a victim in this.  Not saying you need to pay for anything for them in this, just an observation on the situation as a whole.  This will likely change as the kid gets older and starts acting like his parents more, but that is a few years out yet.

Just Oof!", "My thoughts exactly! Also, if they are tight on money and in debt, perhaps they should be taking an expensive vacay. Disney is way overpriced! There are places you can take a vacation and not be out thousands of dollars. They already have a place to stay for free so should be grateful.\n\nPlus the sticker thing.
