I may not get the abbreviations and all that. I 38F, am a small business owner since January 2020. Needless to say, business has been up and down. And I do very much value my longtime clients. Anyone that works in the industry will tell you you become part of the family and very attached to the families you work for. I had a client that had been working with me for about 2 1/2 years. We will call her Samantha. When I first started working for her, she had just moved here from another state to be closer to her son and her new grandbaby. She was in her mid-60s and working as a nurse but shortly after she became disabled due to a fall and breaking of her hip, unfortunately multiple surgeries were needed, and she was laid up for a good amount of time. And I was slowly watching this woman fall into a depression, and begin drinking very heavily. ( for context I come from a family that struggles with addiction and I lost my mother at 49 years old to her alcoholism.) watching my mother slowly deteriorating. This way took a massive toll on my mental health and well-being. So when I got to work for Samantha one day, she wasn\u2019t answering her door and would often leave it unlocked so I was OK to just walk in to my whore I found her in a pool of her own blood unconscious in her bathroom I called 911 and she was carded out on a stretcher 10 staples later in her head, I get a message from her a few days later, apologizing for not being able to make our cleaning booking. She had no recollection of me being there, even though we had a full conversation after she came to as the EMTs were working on her. But unfortunately, due to her blood alcohol content, she did not remember the conversation at all or the fact that I was the one that called 911. She has contacted me several times to rebook cleaning, but I have opted to terminate our service together. I can\u2019t watch another person drink themselves to death especially someone that I\u2019ve grown to really be Fond of. I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my place to talk about her issue with alcohol as you can\u2019t help somebody that\u2019s not ready to help themselves when it comes to addiction. So I\u2019m curious, am I the asshole? The way I see it I\u2019m trying to protect my own mental well-being, but do you feel terrible? As the last message she sent me she said that she missed me and feels she has lost a friend. \ud83d\ude14 I apologize for the poor grammar spelling, and any other typos and run on sentences.
