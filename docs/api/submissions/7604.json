My 20 year old stepson, our 15 year old son, our 11 year old daughter and 10 year old son. \n\nPlease bare with me this is a long one\n\nWe've been together for 18 years, I came into my stepsons life when he was 2 years old. He was absolutely brilliant as a child, loved to talk. I would take him to nursery, carry him on my shoulders walking up the big hill to the nursery, I love him like my own. His biological dad died about 5 years ago and it was tough on him. His bio dad and me got on well, no drama or issues. He was a good guy, only never paid child support, not that we needed it, or got him much for birthdays or Christmas.  But his biological dad's parents and his sister spoiled him rotten all the time. So much so that at the age of 16, not long after his dad passed, he moved out and into his grans house because we don't just give him what he wants when he wants it but they do. So the problem started when we booked a holiday for my wife, me and our 3 children, my stepson said he'd like to go as well, he's 20 and working so we said that's fine but you'll need to pay your own way. That was fine, I've been paying his monthly debit and he's been paying me back when he's got paid, was going great till he lost his job for too many sick days, i.e going out with friends and not making work next day. This happened the week before Christmas. So I paid his latest monthly payment. He's made no attempt to pay me back and when questioned about it he says he hasn't had the money and I replied but you've managed to get money to go out just about every weekend since, he didn't reply. Now it's coming up to the next payment I've told him I'm not paying it for him, if he's not working he won't be able to go, he's called me an arsehole because I'm paying for his brothers and sisters to go but not him. I said they're all under 16 years old and children,  you're a 20 year old man that's still living with his gran.\n\n He's never bought his gran, mum, aunts or anyone a Christmas gift or birthday gift ever but expects everyone to buy him, he never sees my side of the family at all until its his birthday or Christmas then comes round to see what they've got for him.\n\nHe's just so self centred, spoiled, entitled and its hard for me and my wife to see because he was never raised like that.\n\nOh and last year he told me he doesn't see me as a dad, that hurt but it was understandable he has a dad, who unfortunately isn't with us anymore but he did say I was like his best friend. \n\nI don't know, I love him just as much as my other kids, it's just hard to see him doing nothing with his life, expecting other people to pay his way for him. I want him to be working, making something of himself, not being a bum.\n\nApologies for the long post, just don't know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.", "created_utc": 1673979041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ej0am/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_20_year_old_step_sons/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So maybe apply that to future holidays if you haven\u2019t already.", "NTA\n\nSounds like he needs to learn how the adult world works and get a reality check that when you're twenty you can't just expect your parents to pay for everything for you.  He'll be pissed but he needs some tough love otherwise he'll just keep acting the way that he has been and won't get another job.", "NTA. Whether your stepson or bio-son doesn\u2019t matter, you\u2019re treating him the way he needs to hopefully shake him out of his selfish and entitled behavior. Kudos to you and your wife for doing what is necessary to not enable him. Continue to love him, make sure your door and heart are open to him but close the wallet until he matures a bit. \n\nI know he\u2019s your stepson but I\u2019m sure that didn\u2019t make it hurt any less when he rejected you as a father figure. That happened to me too. I Hope things turn around with him.", "Nta. He\u2019s at a turning point in his life. Sink or swim. His dad\u2019s family is happy letting him sink.

In ten years he will be thankful you fought to keep him above the water.", "Being a step parent that sees the need to force some independence on step kids who are either making poor decisions because you are there as a backstop or failure to mature is tough. \n\nNever regret making someone else, especially an adult, reckon with the consequences of their actions. \n\nYou are absolutely not the asshole, and anyone who might think you are is likely the age (or emotionally so) of your stepson and would try the same shit. \n\nOnly advice is stick with it. I oscillated back and forth and it just made everything confusing.", "NTA. You are correct in your assessment. He's 20. He moved out to live with bio dad's family because they give him what he wants when he wants it. They can spoil him more and take him on vacations. He wants to go back and forth depending on who he can get things or trips from. Let grandparents and aunt continue to own this kid's issues. Have a happy family vacation.", "NTA - He's an adult now and needs to manage his own affairs.  You've tried hard, but clearly his paternal relatives' indulgence undid a lot and he's going to have to take accountability for that, the sooner the better.  You don't owe a grown child a paid vacation, especially when he should be busy job hunting and his comparing your paying for your younger children is a total deflection move.  He needs to pay his own bills and make his own way now--do him the favor of not enabling him further.", "I will say its understandable why he would struggle to compute why he's being left out of a family trip with his parent and siblings. At 20, most kids can't afford a holiday and rely on their parents to help them out with things like that. \n\n*Now* that being said, it sounds like there's a deeper inter personal conflict and a financial responsibility conflict. \n\nYour stepson has demonstrated that he cannot be fiscally responsible and is still largely dependent on you and his mum to keep him afloat. It sounds like the 3 of you need to have a sit down and really hammer some financial literacy into this kid because the way he's spending right now is setting him up for behaviours that will dig a very large hole of debt for him if he doesn't smarten up. \n\nSet some conditions for helping him out financially and stick to the consequences (even if it hurts). \n\nUltimately, this is less about the trip and more about his financial issues, NTA.", "NTA He\u2019s 20 and would be able to hold down a job if he didn\u2019t lack professionalism.

It appears, they are just now realizing that with adulthood comes very harsh responsibilities.", "op=NTA\n\nBecause you spelled out the requirements here and gave him payment options.\n\nAnd because he lost his job for partying/calling in sick--that is just irresponsible.  He doesn't deserve being rewarded for bad choices.", "NTA. When I finished high-school, my dad gave me a signed letter. Basically saying I'm a man now, I need to take responsibility. My problems was mine to deal with. \n\nIt was hard work and long hours. But today I'm in the position to carry not only my wife and kids, but also my parents and inlaws. My dad was always there if I needed advice. But it was up to me to find my way. \n\nThe letter is framed and hanging in my office today. The best lessons in life comes from life itself.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nHe needs to grow up and take responsibility. You've done a lot for him, it's tough when someone is young and struggling, but then he turns around and skips work to the point where he gets fired - well, obviously the struggle is only of his own choosing. \n\nTell him that you care about him as much as he cares about himself - or as little. If he won't work to support himself, you'll follow his example and won't work to support him either.", "NAH. \n\nIt's normal that he doesn't see you as a dad; he has/had a dad and it's not you. That doesn't mean you're not important to him. Let that part go. \n\nAs for the holiday: Of course he's disappointed that you laid down a boundary (work or don't go) but it's a good and normal boundary to lay down. Can you sit down and talk to him about his current job search and how it's going? He may need guidance and help; it's a weird time right now to be trying to get work. He may be floundering and unsure where to start.", "YTA for not including him in the family vacation in the first place (\"So the problem started when we booked a holiday for my wife, me and our 3 children, my stepson said he'd like to go as well\"). You really booked this without including him, or even *asking* him whether he wanted to be included?\n\nYou should have asked, and paid his way when he said he wanted to go.\n\nWhat you *shouldn't* be doing (unless you really want to) is paying off his credit card. His debt, his responsibility. Let him feel the consequences of goofing off on the job. You've got the whole situation bass-ackwards, in my opinion.", "YTA - this situation is so backwards. You absolutely should be taking him on vacation like your other children (and paying), and treating him like one of your own. But also he\u2019s a 20 YO, why are you paying his debit card off if he has bad habits with money? Pay for him for vacations, family get togethers, Xmas, Bday, etc. But he needs to sustain himself otherwise, he\u2019s an adult. Sorry it sounds like losing his dad messed him up. And I wouldn\u2019t take offense to him saying you aren\u2019t his dad - like you said, he had a good dad. But you can be a male role model still.\n\nThe monthly debit payment system is encouraging poor financial habits.", "ESH - You've got this a little backwards. As a parent  you should still be paying for him to come on family vacations at age 20, but you never should have been paying for his debit card while he was an adult. But I am a little confused on how your debit card works... debit is real money and the transaction happens instantly. Credit cards are the ones that get paid off monthly and allow you to spend money you don't have yet (even though that is a bad idea to do).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Most will not have enough money to pay for it themselves.  He is young still.  Most adult kids grow and change the most between 20-30, some take a little longer.  Had several kids and all did eventually become self-sufficient and home owners.  Not all mature at the same rate.  You should not be allowing him to create debt every month and pay you back.  That is a viscous cycle that just teaches him to live beyond his means.  It encourages bad financial planning.

Check-in with him, and ask him what's going on. \n\nI don't think you are the asshole, maybe you were a little too harsh, but that's understandable.

Kid needs parenting not to be cut off. Obviously he has been spoiled and it is showing.  Seems OP is trying tough love, this takes time to sink through the thick male skull. I had a lot of slow learning before I became a decent man. Pain is a part of the process, in this case, the pain of missing a vacation. NTA", "We are talking about a 20 year old who still lives with his family and is figuring out what financial independence and adult responsibilities look like, not some 40 year old deadbeat. 18 is like a baby adult, 22 is like a toddler adult, and 26 is like a older teen adult. BEtween those ages a lot of people are still on their parent's phone plan or insurance plans, getting help with college bills or rent bills, still keeping their documents at their parents house (like ssn card/birth cert), calling their parents to learn how to make certain appointments and decisions, etc.  If you want to teach your child financial independence the way to do it is to teach them budgeting and responsibility with their money, not by just kicking them out of family events. And I do think it depends on both the family's financial ability and the young adults ability, there is no black and white answer. At 20 the jobs I was working and qualified for paid either minimum of a few bucks more than minimum so I would never have been able to finance a vacation while still keeping up other responsibilities. So if my parents planned a family vacation and they could totally afford to bring all their children but told me I would be excluded unless I fully paid my own way I would have been hurt by that. Now I am 23 and graduated and I have a high paying job so it's not a concern for me, but for arguments sake let's say I'd become a teacher instead of a software developer. Yes I'd be hurt if my parents excluded me from a family vacation even at this older age. But once I'd chosen to move out of my parents home (I officially got my own place at 19 with roommates) I never expected them to cover any of my personal purchases because I understood that going out to drinks with friends is \\*my\\* decision, while a family vacation is \\*their\\* decision. At that, if my parents wanted me to pay my way on vacation I would fully expect to have a say in where we all stay, what we do, where we go, and when."]}
