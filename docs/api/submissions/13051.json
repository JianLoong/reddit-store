They said they would pay in full. Still, I was going for lower schools because I did not want them to pay large prices like 80k a year. It's not my money, I can't ask that. They saw this, inquired why and when I told them, insisted that they would pay for the 80k colleges too, and to absolutely apply there. They continued to reinforce this as I continued to express doubts till the day the admission came out. When I was then telling them how I would pay them back and make their 80k worth it, (what I meant when I said I presented them a case) they took it back, and were angry at my in the moment disappointment. I want to know whether I should have ever believed they were paying and even have a right to be disappointed bc it was a HUGE offer I should never have gotten comfortable with. \n\nI  (17F) unexpectedly got into the #1 school for my major, and was previously heavily leaning towards my state school which is lower ranked. Throughout the entire college application process I never found myself getting excited or hopeful about the future, but with this college things are different and I really want to go.\n\nThere is a significant price difference (80k a year vs 30k) between this college and the state school, and I understand why my parents would be apprehensive about that cost. It's a lot of money, however, they do have savings and enough income to cover this, and have been open about it in the past, in fact I have even been told that if I got into this college, they would absolutely pay. Even after I did research and presented them with a case about why it's a great opportunity for me, they said they were not willing to pay.\n\nMy mother says I'm being an entitled b\\*\\*\\*\\* for being upset about this, and should never have expected them to pay this much, even though I haven't said anything outright and have tried not to show my disappointment to them. Still, I feel I am understandably sad to be missing out on an opportunity, and the entire false promise rubs me the wrong way, as well as wondering why getting into the *number one college for my major*, wouldn't justify them sending me there. I got yelled at for 12 years about keeping my grades up and doing extracurriculars so that I could get into a good college, but when I do, it's not worth it? Yeah. Makes me upset, but maybe I'm wrong for that because it's not my money and I can't expect them to spend it in certain ways. Idk. AITA?\n\n(either way I'm going to get over it and have a good college experience, but I feel I have the right to be upset for a bit?)\n\nEdit: I was never expecting them to pay 80k, in fact I was floored when they continuously told me that they would absolutely pay for a more expensive and challenging school right till I got accepted (In response to me saying I was burnt out, didn't want that competition, and didn't want to take on the burden of that many loans) When I got accepted, and then excited, and they changed, that's when I got upset because they got my hopes up. I see what everyone is saying, I'll take the 30k happily and live a good life.", "created_utc": 1679608987, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zz2nc/aita_for_wanting_my_parents_to_pay_for_college/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I honestly can\u2019t imagine *not* paying for a better college for my kid if they got in. Especially having friends who had to go to state schools because their parents didn\u2019t feel like paying for an Ivy and seeing how much they\u2019re worse off without the credentials. The key here is not *feeling like* even if they can. If they can\u2019t afford it it\u2019s a whole other question.", "Definitely NTA. You know, it really sounds like you went out of your way to be thoughtful and upfront with your parents about the whole college application thing. You even asked if they'd be cool with helping you out financially, and you were totally ready to change your plans based on what they said. So when they told you they'd cover the full cost\u2014even for the pricier colleges\u2014you believed them and applied with that in mind.\n\nI can totally see why you'd feel bummed when they switched things up on you after you got into your dream school. And hey, you even talked about paying them back and making it all worth it, so it's not like you took their offer lightly.\n\nFeeling let down is a pretty natural reaction, especially after all the effort and emotion you put into those applications. Plus, your parents kept backing up their promise, so it made sense to trust them.\n\nYou've got every right to feel the way you do, and having an honest heart-to-heart with your parents might help sort things out.

As a parent who stupidly promised to pay for my kids' entire educations and then actually carried through with it and am miserably broke now... I see their side, BUT I also understand where you're coming from. A good school is a good school, and if they promised to pay for it then didn't, you absolutely have a right to be upset about that.\n\nYou will have a baller time at state school as well, though. Are you moving out and living in the dorms there? In the end, it's the friendships and connections you'll make that matters most in the future, so save that $$, make sure you take advantage of all the resources and events (and parties) you can. \n\nEmployers care a little but not a lot about where you went to school, as long as you can do the job.", "Apparently reading comprehension is going downhill with all the YTA, if your parents told you they would, and nothing dramatic happened to them, then they lied to you and got your hopes up.

They\u2019re still responsible for you!", "If you\u2019re talking a certain institute of technology outside of Boston, don\u2019t listen to anyone telling you YTA for asking for 80k/yr tuition.

I hope they don\u2019t change there mind on the 30k too.\n\nFeel awful for Americans. Loans so big and at such high interest rates people get trapped for decades. It\u2019s disgusting. \n\nI wish you the best of luck and for your parents to give their head a wobble! X", "NTA. You asked before you applied *if* you could expect financial help at all, then tried to focus on less expensive schools. THEY were the ones to promise full tuition, and to push you towards more expensive schools than the ones you had initially planned on. You behaved with maturity and sense, while they promised more than they wanted to pay and then got mad at you for doing what they told you to do.\nPS Those who are voting y t a, and focusing on the cost difference? Grow up. Lots of colleges are expensive now, and that doesn\u2019t stop people from applying. As long as people are willing to pay, they will continue to increase their tuition. Blaming a kid for applying when they were promised full support from their parents doesn\u2019t solve anything, especially when the kid *didn\u2019t demand money from the start*.", "Info- have you looked into loans? You said they had savings, is that an emergency savings, or was it a college savings? Is your major something that pays really well right out of college?", "NTA they shouldn\u2019t have made a promise they weren\u2019t prepared to keep and you\u2019re certainly allowed to feel disappointed that they went back on their word.

If they said they\u2019d pay and are now only backing out because you got in, then you have every right to be upset.", "[deleted]", "Info: what\u2019s your major? Is going to the #1 school likely to justify the extra $200k where you\u2019d be able to pay them back in a reasonable amount of time vs the other school?", "NTA for wanting, asking once, or being upset when the answer is no.  Continuing to ask after being told no puts you in AH territory.  One year of tuition is more than my annual salary.  You are expecting a lot where there are other, less expensive ways to reach your goals.", "NTA, why are they saying that they would pay for it and then name calling you, when you actually want to go there tf", "YTA\n\nYou can want whatever you want, it doesn't make you entitled to their money. You're expecting them to just give you $320,000 over a 4 year degree.", "NTA at some level, and the details of said what and when and how clearly kinda matter.  Yes, parents SHOULD pay, but 50k a year is a lot. Even the 30k a year is more than what most college kids will get from their parents. \n\nWork out with them what they can afford, be clear about that with the schools and see what happens. \n\nPlease, also be realistic about the earning potential of your major and the weight of the student loans you will take one.", "YTA, if you want the more expensive school figure it out. Welcome to adulthood.", "NTA, don't even have to finish reading to know it. You need a tertiary education for basically any job these days and if you parents don't want to contribute to it they shouldn't have had children.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s $80k a year. Are you serious with this?", "Info: \n\nDid you ASK them why they said they'd pay 80k a year and encouraged you to apply to that school if they didn't mean it.  Did they assume you wouldn't get in?\n\n Either way, it's $120,000 vs. $320,000. It's a huge amount.  Do you qualify for financial aid, scholarships,  grants?   Have you talked to your counselor or the school about paying for it? \n\nAlso..are your parents in a financial situation where they could afford it? Have you sat down and discussed their finances and the actual budget for your college? That's pretty important.", "It\u2019s not wrong to be disappointed. Feelings are what they are. I agree that it\u2019s likely that financial stability has changed. Especially with stock markets as volatile as they are.  Parents don\u2019t often disclose their full financial details with their children, and rightfully so.\n\nI do think that a lot of kids don\u2019t really have a full grasp on how much college *really* costs when it\u2019s stacked on top of all other financial responsibilities adults have. Especially adults that are raising children. As others have pointed out, unless your parents are wealthy, 80k a year (300k+ all in) is the cost of a whole house in some areas.\n\nMake sure your parents understand that you were disappointed in the moment, but that you understand (because you seem to).\n\nLook into deferring your #1 school choice until you can complete the 2 year basic credits at a cheaper rate, lots of colleges and universities have transfer programs that allow for this type of thing.\n\nI\u2019m voting ESH because I think all involved could have handled it better.", "YTA, that\u2019s $320,00 for tuition alone (assuming you graduate in 4 years and prices don\u2019t go up), not to even mention room and board. A good compromise would be them contributing what the planned/can afford and you taking out loans, working, finding scholarships for the rest.", "YTA, maybe they simply dont have the cash, if they mislead you its not fair but again its their money not yours. \n\nI would be happy that they are offering to pay at all, you are almost an adult and honestly they dont need to pay anything. \n\nIf you truly want to go for the expensive option maybe find some middle ground?", "YTA. Please don\u2019t assume to know the exact finances of your parents. They\u2019re right, you do sound entitled to expect them to shell out an extra 50k a year for you. That\u2019s 200k you\u2019re taking away from their retirement. The fact that you think 50k extra a year isn\u2019t a big deal is kind of telling. \n\nInstead, find a real solution like looking into scholarships or financial aid.", "YTA for not being appreciative of the very generous 30k they have already offered.  Most people don't even get that because their parents straight up can't afford it", "1) you can still go to the college. If they won\u2019t pay, take a lighter load and pick up a job to pay the rest.\n\n2) they are not required to pay anything towards your education. They can choose to.\n\n3) NTA for wanting them to pay. I don\u2019t know a kid who doesn\u2019t want a free ride.\n\nAll that being said, it\u2019s your education. Take ownership of that. Complaining because they refuse to spend $80k when they were expecting to pay $30k IS entitled thinking.", "I say NAH because they set expectations and then didn\u2019t fulfill their promise. The reality is that you can\u2019t do anything about their decision now because it\u2019s their money. It sounds like you are a great student and I suggest compromise as well. Ask them what they are willing to contribute. hustle to apply for as many grants and scholarships as you can and consider a part time job as well. Do what you can to NOT compromise on the quality and experience of education you want. Good luck!", "YTA\n\nWow, just wow. $30,000 a year isn't good enough so you are demanding over twice that amount? Why not take out student loans? Oh wait, entitlement. That's something I don't understand and likely never will.", "YTA a little. Just because you think they have an extra 200 grand to educate you, doesn't mean that's how they have to spend THEIR money. If you really want to go to this school,  ask if you can have the 120 grand and get loans to cover the rest.", "NTA for wanting them to pay but YTA just a little bit for expecting them pay for an $80K a year school. You probably don't realize it but $80k a year is a lot of money, it's more than a lot of people make in a year, I don't know your parents financial situation but unless they're extremely well off I don't see why they would realistically say yes to that. And I think yta just because it seems like you don't recognize how much money that is just for tuition, room and board (I hope). You still need books, clothes, probably an allowance if you want to do things outside of school, supplies etc. Also your mom shouldn't have called you an entitled b. She's TA for that.", "When I was 18 I went to college full time while working full time paying all my own bills and my own rent. \n\nAt almost the same age you're upset that your parents won't give you almost half a million dollars.\n\nBe honest, what do you think my verdict is gonna be? YTA", "YTA. Yes, you're being very entitled", "Hey man, I\u2019m sorry that your parents did that to you that\u2019s super bummy. However, I would do what other comments are saying and take the state school tuition and your savings and work your butt off for scholarships and work during school. If it\u2019s MIT or anything in that caliber then it will definitely pay off. You will be excel in your career. As someone who opted for the cheap option over an ivy I regret it every day. I wish I just worried about money later. Money is hard to shrug off but it will seriously pay itself. Please go to that #1 school!!!!!!! NTA", "I paid about 100 thousand toward my child's Ivy League college, cash plus parental loans. The child worked two jobs during college and also took out loans. There were no scholarships for the National Merit Finalist. The graduate had some years of sparse income, then did extremely well and took over paying the parental loans. Hurrah! The grandchildren will have much more than enough from their parents to pay for college.", "ESH\n\nThey most likely didn't know that the better school would cost $80k per year.  A lot of parents think that prestigious US colleges give out \"scholarships\" and most of them only give out need-based scholarships, not merit aid.\n\nBut yes, you were being a bit entitled to assume that your parents could magically pull $80k a year out of their savings and income without making significant sacrifices. \n\nI'm glad to see that you've realized the error of your thinking.  You can have a really great experience at the state school.", "YTA. Anyone who expects their parents to pay for college is entitled. Especially 80k a year.", "You may not be aware, but the stockmarkets have taken a nosedive.  Your parents savings may have diminished greatly, and with inflation, that just compounds their worries.  It stinks that they wouldn't honor their agreement, but you will still get a good education and have good prospects after graduation.", "Judging by how things are now I\u2019m guessing that school upped the price on how much it cost to pay for it since Covid hit and they were losing out on a lot of lost money over time. They probably said they would pay back then when things weren\u2019t so high priced. For right now I might het down bored but IMO I have to go to YTA", "Esh\n\nHowever, my best advice is take the best FA deal you got, and go to the school and show them and ask if they can match it or increase your scholarship.", "YTA.  Grow up and figure out the true cost of privilege.  Here is the thing that one will tell you... the ranking of your college of choice doesn't mean a thing in today's workforce.  The fact that you got a degree, isn't even all that it used to be. Stop trying to rob your parents to fund your own ego.\n\nYour parents have to think about things like, other children, their current and future medical costs, retirement...   stop expecting them to carry this full burden.  You want to go there, take out fucking student loans and pay for it yourself.

I told them I understood, but my face betrayed my disappointment and I got yelled at. I was going to give myself two days to process  (away from them of course) and I was just wondering if I'm wrong to even be upset about any of this, as my mother feels. I think I am though based on these comments and you're right, I'll suck it up and move on.", "It\u2019s not an assumption to expect them to go to their promises. If OPs parents are having financial trouble or anything of that nature, they need to communicate that with her. Instead of calling her a b**** when she rightfully complains. She\u2019s only expecting them to shell out an extra 50k because they offered to do so, she didn\u2019t even ask for that initially.", "They offered the 80k without me asking, in response to me saying I didn't want to go to that school or apply because it was 80k. They continued to offer the 80k till the day I got accepted as I expressed further concerns about loans, the pressure of the school, and burnout. Now that I want to go to school, no more 80k. 80k is a lot of money, absolutely don't fault them for that, it's just, the way it was handled I'm upset about. I am very very very very fortunate, and am very sorry if it seems I don't understand that. I will likely end up going to state school and handling majority of the finances myself, I don't think I want their 30k.", "They offered 80k as well. She was appreciative until they started backtracking.", "Why do you think the parents were expecting to pay only $30k? OP says they agreed to \u201cabsolutely pay\u201d if OP got into the top school and the top school costs $80k not $30k.", "\"ecause they set expectations and then didn\u2019t fulfill their promise. \"\n\nThats not N A H, thats what makes the parents the AHs", "Apparently you don\u2019t know how to read or understand that they promised OP they would pay if they got in, and further encouraged them to apply as well?

Being disappointed at that is not.", "I don\u2019t know how its demanding to be upset when they told OP that if they got into the school that they\u2019d pay for it", "I might do that, I have 20k saved on my end, plan on getting a job in college too, so I hope (ideally) to get over 100k taken care of by me and then pay off the loans with my own job afterwards. I just had this conversation and was being very mopey about it and my brain decided it was a good idea to post on reddit and be stupid instead of logical lol. It's been 1.5 hours now though, and it's time to shape up and deal with it.", "The average salary in the US is $53,490", "LOL. When and where was that?? Certainly not recently in the US. College tuition here is ridiculous.", "I'm not upset they're not giving away the money, it was a big ask. Mainly just wondering if my reaction to be disappointed in the moment when there was previous expectation was wrong, of course I'm grateful that they're paying, I would be stupid to not be. Actually yeah. This post makes me look very entitled and I guess I am. I'll suck it up and pay for college myself with high school job money and college work.", "How sway?", "They knew. OP writes:\n\n>They offered the 80k without me asking, in response to me saying I didn't want to go to that school or apply because it was 80k.

OP didn\u2019t expect anything in the first place, just confused and disappointed.", "College rankings obviously matter. Maybe not to the amount of $320k but attending a prestigious school opens up doors. It doesn\u2019t entitle OP to their parents money but they\u2019re allowed to be upset about their parents changing their mind about paying for it", "mom?", "Ya, they're definitely going to have to start saving for retirement now. OP should remember this when they need end of life care. Hopefully they gave a golden child to look after them.", "They told her each time she asked if that was an okay amount that it was perfectly okay. She is no way an AH for trusting her parents, her parents are huge fucking AHs", "why not do this; Take their 30k that they would be able to fund for state school and then find scholarships to cover some more of the cost and the rest take loans?\n\nThat way you can still get this opp", "It\u2019s ok to feel disappointed. Perhaps you can look into applying for some scholarships?", "You have a right to your feelings.  You are not being demanding about it.    You were disappointed that your parents went back on their offer.   That\u2019s not sulking. \n\nYou sound like you have a good head on your shoulders, and will do well no matter where you end up going.", "The price difference doesn\u2019t matter because they offered to pay either one. If they only promised 30k then OP would be the AH, but they offered 80k as well. She didn\u2019t even have to ask. If they\u2019re on hard times they need to communicate with OP instead of calling her a b****.", "They should have thought about that before saying they would pay for it. Now they are just lying assholes.", "Thats why the onus is on the parents to communicate clearly. It\u2019s obvious that if you tell your child that you will pay for them to go to an 80k school, that if they get in they will expect you to pay 80k.  If the parents circumstances changed, they should\u2019ve told OP", "So they shouldn't have offer to pay. Their financial situation is irrelevant to the fact that they are lying assholes.", "Ngl you gave little informations about them but with what you said they seems narc a bit, at least your mom, being verbally abusive like that but also pulling the rugs on promise they make just to call you name like they never said they would help you, it\u2019s weird.\n\nOr she\u2019s just an abusive control freak, but most of the times it goes hands in hands with being a narc", "I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that", "Dude you already saved 20 k and you are only like 18? Damn being an American sounds expensive af", "That's great! Head to your guidance office tomorrow and ask them about all scholarships that are available. Fill out every single one even if you think you don't apply. When my niece graduated somebody did that and this kid must have got 40 different scholarships! Some of them were only for a couple hundred dollars but others were for several thousand. She even got one for a boy's basketball thing, but nobody had applied so she won by default because they have to give it away if they have a applicant.\n\nAlso since your parents seem to have at least some money speak to them about helping you get a regular loan instead of going with the school loans because the way the interest is calculated is completely different. You end up paying a lot more when you get school loans, also some of them can give you penalties if you pay them off early depending on what loan you get. So possibly your parents can help you by co-signing a loan. Good luck!", "What type of engineering? I am an engineer and the state school here happens to be one of the best, but if you go to a major state school anywhere, you won\u2019t have a problem getting a job.", "\\#1 in engineering... Is the school MIT?", "TIL thinking your parents will keep their promises is entitled lol", "I\u2019m baffled by the amount of people that think y t a. It\u2019s ridiculous.", "It doesn\u2019t matter though\u2026 they offered both price points and then pulled out unexpectedly. She\u2019s not simply expecting money to expect it.

They went back on their promise, and had absolutely no right to yell at you for being disappointed!\n\nI cannot believe the comments here! Of course you\u2019re disappointed! You have every right to be disappointed!!\n\nAnd after you take a couple days to process that disappointment, you can start thinking about your options. \n\n(Everyone saying Y T A here is missing the context!)\n\nETA: I\u2019m an old, lest anyone think I\u2019m just saying this because I\u2019m college aged.", "Sounds like they wanted the bragging rights so they said what you wanted to hear to get you ti apply. I\u2019m guessing they were never planning to pay the full price.", "Take it. If you're in the US, the government expects parents to contribute a lot unless the student is 24 or older. Don't get into severe debt over pride. Your parents have pushed you hard and promised to pay for college. Let them pay for the state school. You don't want to go to the lesser college AND have a ton of debt.", "They\u2019ve said both they will and won\u2019t pay for it. Regardless, circumstances change over time and they probably don\u2019t really have the funds for it now and probably didn\u2019t set up appropriate funds to pay for it. They failed to plan.\n\nIrregardless, OP\u2019s education (once 18) is ultimately OP\u2019s responsibility.", "I think their finances changed. Most of the methods for saving large sums of money are tied somehow to markets, even those that are conservative when it comes to risk. It could be that with the volatility in the markets of the last couple years either their savings, any college fund, *or* their retirement fund could have taken a really big hit.\n\nOr one of them could be a secret gambling addict. Who knows. But based on their defensive reaction I\u2019m going to bet they are not as financially secure as they were when they agreed.", "That\u2019s like agreeing to buy a Subaru and being expected to buy a Range Rover, every year for 4 years.", "I have a feeling that if you were able to save up 20 grand at the age of 17, you have a good head on your shoulders and will do just fine. I may have to change my judgment. Congratulations on the acceptance.", "Canada. Was paying about 6k per semester so about 24k per year.", "It\u2019s not unreasonable to be disappointed that somebody reneged on a promise that was important to you. You didn\u2019t yell or demand the money, you just felt disappointed and it showed.

My kid went and has a great job. He used the extra $ we put away as a house down payment.", "State schools can really be variable quality though, it depends on how much funding they're given. Some state schools have reputations for being very strong in engineering and can command the same level of network/recruiting/resources as an MIT/Caltech/Stanford, e.g. UC Berkeley, UW, etc., in which case it could be more cost effective for OP to attend their state school if they're getting essentially the same benefits on a lower budget. However, some states don't have that same level of program, in which case it could be a better long term move for OP to choose the more expensive school that likely comes with a bigger recruitment/resources/alumni network, especially since OP is going into engineering, a major that regularly commands 6 figure salaries post-grad. I actually believe that you can get a good education at any school, but in the employment market name brand does unfortunately often matter.", "Yes lol apparently dangling money in front of you and then snatching it and calling you names and expecting you not to be disappointed is \"entitled\"", "Even if everything you said is true the parents are still the AH. \n\nThey either reneged on their promise because they simply changed their mind (which makes them AH) or they can\u2019t carry out out their promise for some reason but instead of fessing up they decide to call their daughter an entitled bitch for feeling disappointed that they reneged (which also makes them AH).", "The problem with saying it's solely OPs responsibility is that if you have wealthy parents who refuse to help them you get totally fucked on financial aid.\n\nFor many top schools, if your family is low income that 80k tuition becomes zero, but if they're high income but won't pay then the school wants full price which is basically impossible even with student loans for just undergrad.", "then instead of calling her an entitled bitch they should be honest about the situation", "If that were true (education after age 18 is not the parents\u2019 responsibility) then financial aid wouldn\u2019t be based off the parents\u2019 income, i.e. the FAFSA.
