Best bargains include 2 full lobsters for $4.50, half a kg of sea scallops for under $1, 4 racks of pork ribs for $5 and the list goes on. It\u2019s helped a lot with the budget as I share the groceries with my roommate (19m) who isn\u2019t as well off as I am so it lets me continue buying and cooking some meals that he would otherwise be unable to afford. \n\nThe other night I was hosting some mates for our friends Christmas and whilst it was definitely more extravagant than any of our past Christmas meals, because of shopping the sales it didn\u2019t cost me a whole lot. One of my mates (Jay) asked me how much money he needed to send to me but I told him what I told you guys in the first paragraph and because of that I can afford to go all out. After this, Suzie (part of the group but more of a mate\u2019s girlfriend than an actual friend to me) straight up asked how I felt stealing food from the poor. It caught me off guard cause WTF, and I asked her what do you mean by that?? \n\nShe told me when she was young that her mum had to shop the specials in order to feed herself and the kids and on nights where there weren\u2019t any, they had to just eat Vegemite on toast or something. I said I\u2019m sorry to hear what she went through but from what the staff told me, most of the stuff gets thrown out anyway after not being bought, to which she replied that the homeless rely on this thrown out food for a meal. We have a soup kitchen that is open every night in our town, so whilst we still have homeless people, no one is starving to death. \n\nSuzie asked if I have ever had to eat at the soup kitchen whiI hadn\u2019t, and started telling me about how embarrassing it was as a child having to go there and get handouts. She then called me the grinch who stole some kids Christmas dinner and at this point I told her if she wants to get mean then get out because even tho it didn\u2019t cost hundreds of dollars, I still put in many hours of cooking over 2 days to put together a great dinner. Her and mark (her boyfriend) left and he sent me a text letting me know that Suzie never wants to see me again. I asked where does this leave us and he said that he doesn\u2019t know.\n\nPretty much everyone else is on my side, but all of my mates and I have a more privileged background (not rich but never had to worry about where our next meal was coming from) and the thoughts are stuck in my head, so I\u2019ve come to reddit for a more diverse set of answers.

There is, evidently, food left over. It is not stealing from poor people to buy things that are on sale.\n\nSupermarkets still throw out food whether there is marked down food left or not. Actually many supermarkets in Australia (I'm assuming you're here, because Vegemite) have deals with food rescue organisations to redistribute food, and also lock their bins. So if stuff is actually getting *thrown out* it was never going to make it to feeding an unhoused person anyway.\n\nBesides which, where is an unhoused person going to store or cook 4 racks of pork ribs, exactly?\n\nAnd by Suzie's logic, anyone buying anything perishable even at full price, is 'stealing food from the poor/homeless' since if they didn't buy it it would get marked down or thrown out.\n\nIt just doesn't make any sense. Leaving marked down food in the supermarket just in case a poor person will later buy it is not a solution to anything.\n\nAnd the final point is that if supermarkets didn't recoup any of their costs by at least selling something at a marked down price instead of throwing it out, they would factor that in by increasing the retail price of the food, putting it even further out of the reach of poor people. Are supermarkets sh\\*tty profiteers making excessive profits out of a basic human necessity? Yes. But nonetheless, that's how that would go.\n\nSuzie's getting outraged over nothing. If she wants to get (rightly) mad about about poverty and homelessness she needs to direct her anger at the causes, and you are not it.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIf your friend thinks \"the poor\" are out hunting for discount lobster she is delusional.

She\u2019s the grinch who stole the happiness out of the air. You\u2019re not responsible for how someone else was raised, and their life thus far. There\u2019s literally no correlation and to accuse you of stealing from the poor is crazy. People need to stop blaming others for how their life turned out and make the best out of what they have now. She\u2019s one bitter grinch that\u2019s for sure.", "NTA, she\u2019s way out of line. It was nice of you to spend time and money to make a nice meal for everyone.", "NTA. She's off her rocker", "As someone who grew up worse than poor, NTA and just ignore her.

You should consider disassociating yourself from Sourpuss Suzie.", "NTA - The sales are meant for anyone, not just people who are in desperate need.   If you were getting free food from a food bank for example when you don't need it, it would make sense that someone would tell you to not to, but your friend's logic is flawed that sales are only for those who can't afford the food. \n\nUsually sales like that are more for when they have too large of a surplus of food that didn't sell as good as they thought it would when fresh, so put it on sale while it's still in shape to sell so they don't have to trash it.  \n\nThat's why some stores do major sales like that, here that we end up hitting.", "NTA\n\nThe sales are for everyone. Whatever she said and however you responded, she would have been unhappy. I think if you told her, the money you save with the sales you donate to or buy food for a food pantry, she would have had an argument as to why you should do something different.\n\nFriends GF may still be dealing with the experience with food insecurity from when she is younger or maybe she is just triggered because more people are dealing with it now or maybe she doesn\u2019t like you and was looking to pick a fight. \nNo matter what her issue is, you were smart to shop the sales and not let the food go to waste. \n\nHopefully you and your friend will be OK.", "NTA at all, saving money isn\u2019t just for people on low income.

Sales are for everyone, and while you don't sound destitute, you don't sound like you're super rich, either. She makes it sound like you're racing around, snatching up food out of the hands of poor, single mothers. You're perfectly entitled to these sales. You're also doing a good thing, keeping food from being wasted. This sounds like she's not being very rational about this, though.

I don't think you'll change her mind so I'd be prepared to write her and her boyfriend off. (This is similar to the thread going around about it being unethical to shop at thrift stores if you aren't broke. It's inane. You were preventing food waste and helping local shops stay afloat. Most stores don't have the infrastructure to donate to food banks nightly and most food banks don't have the infrastructure to take highly perishable foods and get them into clients hands before they spoil. Fresh scallops are NOT an easy donation for a food bank to deal with \ud83e\udd28", "NTA\n\nI actually think she might be a tad bit jealous that you were able to get all of that food for a fraction of the price, and she never thought of it or was never able to get those deals.

That\u2019s where she becomes TA. And if Mark ends your friendship over this, he\u2018s also an AH.", "NTA. If those markdown items don\u2019t sell, the store will just throw them away.  It isn\u2019t like you\u2019re snatching food out of hungry people\u2019s mouths.

Consider that a gift.\n\n The food is there for sale and you bought it. End of. It's not like going to the food bank when you can afford the supermarket.

Go ahead and enjoy.", "NTA - I bet she would also abuse someone who shopped at an op shop.", "NTA. I'm very conscious of not taking things that are intended for the needy. But manager's specials aren't intended for the needy. Further, a lot of food stores have locks on the dumpster to prevent dumpster diving. \n\nSuzie is rude.

I'd consider her not wanting to see you again a blessing.", "NTA\n\nThat's like if someone said you can't shop at a thrift shop unless you're poor. These places like thrift shops and grocery stores are always stocked and abundant. It's not like things are running out like TP during the pandemic. It's better to have someone take these things and put them to use instead of letting them go to waste\n\nAlso this girl is just making up conclusions as if you're literally taking food from a dumpster that is known to be cleaned out entirely by homeless people who would then cook all of this meat the whole stock\n\nMy family grew up poor and she's just mad at you for not being poor for no reason", "NTA. You\u2019re good. It\u2019s not illegal or immoral to shop sales when someone poorer than you might also be shopping the sales.", "Honestly I wouldn't invite Suzie to anything ever again. \n\nNTA", "NTA-  your friend just had an axe to grind or trauma that needs to be worked out. \n\nIt's not like you're getting it from the food bank or something. I doubt there are enough low-income people hitting up that deal to take all the cheap food. \n\nI've been poor enough to have to go a few days at a time without eating much, I've been without a home living semi-rough in an old barn (it was dry, at least lol).\n\nI might be a bit upset if somebody else got the last cheap (x) but unless there is nothing else in the store I can afford it's just a mild inconvenience. \n\nAnd poverty affects someone's ability to get around. If they are riding a bus, and the store closes after the last run, anybody without a car or within walking distance can't get out there in time, anyway. The busses where I am run like every hour and a half right now, even if there was a stop later, depending on the area someone might not want to sit out in the dark for 45 minutes. If they have a car that's unreliable or has problems that make it less safe to drive at night (we had a car that lost battery power fast with the headlights on, so only drove after dark when it was absolutely required, for example) they are unlikely to go shopping late. \n\nAnd when we've been really poor, we were almost exclusively buying shelf-stable items that didn't have to be consumed quickly. If I got something nice but was to wiped out to really spend much time in the kitchen for a few days/week (or didn't have a proper oven/stove, or was using a cooler as a fridge) it would go bad and just be a waste of limited funds. \n\nMost food that is expiring gets thrown out (or goes to animals). That's not an opinion, it's a fact. It may still be good for awhile, but it takes some experience to be confident in your ability to determine if expired food is still OK, and if it isn't that can be very bad. So most people just won't risk it. \n\nAnd just because you have more money than some other people doesn't mean you have to spend extravagantly.  That's just silly. There's nothing wrong with being frugal. \n\nIf you're really worried, instead of letting food rot in a landfill to help a random theoretical poor person, donate to places that provide food and supplies free. Find some local place if possible. There is at least one org here that makes meals and takes them out right to the people who need them. A couple of the churches downtown do at least one meal a day for unhomed people. There are a couple places that take clothes/blankets/supplies and give them to people who need them.", "NTA.  A lot of the food is thrown away, not donated.  I sincerely doubt you\u2019ll have any homeless people foraging a dumpster so they can cook up a lobster dinner.  Susie sounds just a little too crunchy and sanctimonious.", "NTA. Reminds me of my mother forcing me to clean my plate because children were starving in Africa.", "NTA Ask her what she's doing to help. I also shop discount because I'm poor, but jeez, I can't be the first one at the store. This isn't \"helping the poor\" like she thinks it is.

It\u2019s pretty clear and reasonable that Susie has experienced trauma as a child through these experiences but she is drawing a long bow to suggest that discounted food is effectively taken from the mouths of the homeless.

Personally the scandi ways of dealing with homelessness are more my way of thinking. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH by any means but if you want to give back, esp if you work in a larger organisation, they might have workplace giving and they may also match your donation. I donate some money this way each pay cycle and I personally feel a small victory that I make my employer support my charitable choices even in that small way. For food poverty especially, Food Bank are really good, for homeless meals, Ozharvest are the go-to. I watched a program the other day where Ozharvest said for $1 they can make two meals (they have their own chefs and kitchens), so if you gave $5 a fortnight and made your employer match, that\u2019s 20 meals that month. I feel like it goes further than the 50% you saved on the discounted food and goes to an organisation that can directly impact with positive outcomes. \n\nI\u2019m also a fan of Orange Sky who provide laundry services to the homeless if anyone has spare cash they like to donate.", "NTA.

I might buy the reduced lobster at Christmas but honestly while I love lobster and scallops, they aren\u2019t crazy filling for $4.50 so on my budget I am not seeking them out. But if it was 5 bucks for a fancy filling cut of red meat probably.\n\nRibs are cheap but cost a lot to oven cook slowly at the current prices.

I genuinely meal prep or keep packaging from online orders to wrap stuff like that to go out to get more use from my bin to cut costs.\n\nSuzie clearly has some food related trauma but you not buying lobsters won\u2019t fix that. And there are so many ways to be food insecure or in foood poverty that applying blanket statements is rarely helpful. For example I am cash poor but time rich as I am stuck home. A slow cooker works for me. When I worked three jobs and had a tight budget and erratic schedule it would have not. People often get quite indignant that my budgeting at home \u2018wouldn\u2019t work if you had kids you know. I do know. And I don\u2019t have kids. \n\nFood poverty competition trials are my least favourite bit of being poor. No one seems to do it about toilet roll or bin bags or clothes to the same extent which why I usually avoid the topic IRL.
