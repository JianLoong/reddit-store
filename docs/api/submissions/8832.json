We never had an issue about sexism before, so when I saw comments about him being sexist, I guess it's only now I'm thinking he's being rude to me because I'm female.

I didn't want to be awkward with his uncle if I got Jack fired.

For context Jack, since his first week here, have always talked down on me and tried to make me do non-office related tasks like clean the toilets (our building has a cleaning crew) or get him coffee from a place 15 mins away (not my job, there are also a lot of delivery apps in our area). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe'd continuously ring my phone and tell me to get him a pen or other office supplies, when we all get them from same filing cabinet and it's closer to him. If I refuse his orders, he'll say things like \"then what's the use of having you min wage worker here?\" low enough that next person to his desk won't hear but I will hear over the phone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat's why in my angry reactive state, I talked about making more money than him because I know he'll get offended that I earn more than him.", "Also, I am freshly out of college so the same age as him, and it is drilled into you in business school to have your email read something like:\nHi mr. Name,\n\nI was wondering (yadayada). Please let me know.\n\nBest, \nFundip\nLike that is the CORRECT way to write an email and it is not cringe at all! so in the end the client probably thought his comment was inappropriate and just plain wrong themselves, they just didn\u2019t wanna say anything. This guys just saying shit to say shit, I would never use a different wording on my email until I got close to the receiver.", "Uhhh wow.. wow wow wow. I don\u2019t even know how to respond to what I just read. You definitely need to push HR on this! Get as many people to back you all up as much as you can. This man doesn\u2019t sound like someone I\u2019d feel comfortable working with. Or even be in the same room with..", "I don't think salary is a good point honestly \n\nHe's new, you've been there for 10 years, would be wild if it was close \n\nI think on his side this is clearly unprofessional and you need to establish what is and what isn't okay, anywhere I've been jack would have been fired by now. You need to assess how to discuss this with his uncle. He just seems like a prick who doesn't even appreciate having this job. It's not awkward when jack is terrible, this isn't about just you, it's about the impact he has on the clients, the colleagues, the business which is clearly a negative. You should be putting him on performance review and trying to fire him.\n\nBut on your end, it's been 10 years, you're clearly good at your job, the uni thing shouldn't be such a barb for you anymore, if it's still a chip you probably should consider therapy long term.", "Aaaaahahahaha OH\n\nIf you got hired \u201cas a favor,\u201d it\u2019s a good sign that no one *wants* to hire you.

You guys may have a close knit group but I'd be livid if another employee was able to access my pay that easily - I would be wondering what else he looked at ? If he looked at mine, did he see any accommodations for me or my colleagues. \n\nYour HR might not be used to employee relations but this is a bomb waiting to blow they need to get rid of that guy FAST - hopefully this is a wakeup call for him", "True. I just don't know how an awesome guy like Jack uncle became related to someone like Jack. Jack's Uncle is like a father figure to a lot of us. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's 2 who will vouch for the restaurant incident so far.

I guess one of the reasons why I went for the pay is since his first week here, he always disregard whatever I said and try to do something else just to contradict me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere were variation of comments like, \"You don't know anything, you don't have a degree.\" I'm ok with not getting a degree. I'm just very baffled about it's such a Huge Thing for him. He tried to order me around like I'm his errand girl, like telling me to go fetch him coffee in a cafe a few mins drive away (I refused and told him that's not my job) or told me to clean the toilets because it smells (I also refused and told him there's an email address for our office to report the situation to our building's cleaning team). There were also comments like, \"Do it, min wage worker.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn our language, there's a word Hampaslupa, which is like an insult towards those in poverty and that's what he calls me when no one else is around. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I find it funny because \"wow, that kid has ISSUES\"... but yeah, as I'm compiling this thing for HR, Owner, and Uncle, I wanna hit myself for being too easygoing and not seeing that he's been over the line for far too long.

Owner and Jack's Uncle are both in an out of city project and will be back end of week (hopefully).

At this point, I think he will not risk his hard earned reputation for a good for nothing nephew like that. Plus, his uncle is one of those \"I worked for years to have enough money for my own education\" types, I am betting he would be so disappointed when he hears that Jack has been insulting me just because I don't have a degree. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first I didn't want to bring Jack's behavior towards me because it might embarrass his uncle but at this point... it's better that he knows that he's lifting the wrong person (Jack) up.", "WAIT.  Is Jack a nepotism hire? Did his uncle help get him this job?  It would explain why this guy has zero clue what the real world is like and how to keep a job...\n\nEdit:  Sorry OP, I read more and see you answered this already.  Jack was hired because Uncle asked for a favor basically.

His uncle his a well like and well respected person in the company and retiring soon. He asked Owner to hire Jack as a favor so he can train Jack in the field. I don't think he knows Jack has been an awful guy. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think he worked during his student days because his Uncle paid for any niece or nephew who took a degree related to our field. His uncle is very proud to be able to support his nephews/nieces so they didn't have to struggle the way he did.", "There were 3 of them there. Jack, Adam (guy who was there, and Ben (came in later after the incident bc he parked the car). Adam and Ben said they have text messages between them about how embarrassed Adam is about Jack's behavior but didn't wanna approach the girl to report Jack since that could make a scene and client can walk in on them while Jack is getting his face slapped by the girl. Also had the \"do we let her go on w/ her day as it is or do we ruin this girl's day by telling her our own fcking coworker is a perv recording her?\" dilemma."]}
