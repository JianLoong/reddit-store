He put you on blast in an e-mail with a client. That is very unprofessional. Then he does and makes sexist comments and degraded you. Glad HR disciplined him.", "NTA. Jack sounds sexist and ageist. He needs to learn to respect his co-workers, especially those that have been around way longer than he had. He sounds like someone who had peaked during high school and bullied freshies on frat houses. Probably thinks the way to get into the \"right\" people's good graces is to turn it onto a social pecking order. Complain to HR if he insults you again. I also has a 4 year degree, a two-times board passer, and until recently a junior in a law school but the world would freeze over before I start disrespecting people in my workplace.

You didn't even report his behaviour to HR which you had every right to and if you did he would most likely have his employment terminated. There is nothing wrong with standing up for yourself.", "NTA. He's getting worse, and you needed to let him know that you will not be his doormat. Sure, maybe the money part wasn't as needed, but his ego and snide comments coming after you are uncalled for and unprofessional, and sometimes, a bully needs to be bullied a bit. \n\nHopefully he will realize he needs to be professional before he loses his job.", "NTA and your co-worker is an a-hole who is wrong and doesn't know how to deal with clients or read the room.\n\nOf course, the core of a work email must be focussed on the issue raised by the client and the solution to their problems, but formalities **are** important and give the email a professional look.

Sounds like he\u2019s an entitled brat who is intimidated by a successful woman so he has to belittle you to try to \u201cput you in your place.\u201d And when that fails he resorts to the favorite of misogynists; to imply you must be sleeping with the boss to be that successful because to accept you are hardworking and capable would be to admit that he isn\u2019t as successful and look at his short comings and guys like that are incapable of admitting they are less than awesome.", "NTA he sounds unprofessional to the level that it could potentially hurt your company. Undermining a co worker in front of clients (like the cringe thing) is an extreme no-no and I would consider reporting it for the sake of the company.", "NTA. Men like this absolutely ruin good workplaces because they're insecure around women who are more senior than they are. Document everything he says and does to you from here forward. He sounds like he's definitely stupid enough to try and retaliate for his final warning.\n\nAlso, please don't take anything he's said as being truth. People like him always hunt for someone to go after. It's never an accurate measure of your quality.", "NTA.\nIs this like his first real job after passing the board? It doesn't sound like he knows what it means to be a \"professional\".\nHe sounds entitled as AF and needs a huge dose of reality. \n\nAlso is he allowed to just look up what everyone else is being paid??

Made me feel better that your company is on your side.\n\nBest regards.\nYou're NTA", "NTA \n\nBut also like mentioning pay is a weak move when there's so much more value you bring \n\nAlso cringe is such an immature kid thing to say, I'd get him fired or at least put on probation for unprofessional behaviour (you mentioned it was with a client email) \n\nIf you're getting paid 6X you should have more authority. And put in professional structures and explain to him what he is doing is not OK.

If you had just stopped talking after asking if he'd like you to pass his thoughts on to the owner it would have been awesome! \n\nHe would be stuck standing there all wide eyed and stammering and you could have walked away and handled it with HR.

I can do that faster.\n\nMe: Step B is part of the contract with all of our clients and it's part of regulation, it's required.\n\nThen Jack gets angry because Step B takes time and blames Step B when his past his deadlines. Note that Step B is not a problem when it's older licensed employees doing the job.", "That's insinuation that I'm the side chick is the one that got me most angry. I've been working for Owner for a decade, have witnessed how awesome he is to his family. Been here since Owner's daughters are in high school and watched them graduate college and start their own careers. Saying he has a side-chick (me or someone else) is so insulting to me + Owner + Owner's awesome wife. It's like he didn't even stop to think that he's insulting Owner who hired him as a favor.", "Thank you for bringing this up. \n\nThe client didn't reply on his email and I replied to him alone (removed the clients on my  reply) so I thought it could be handled between us. I'll report it and get feedback on how to handle the client's side. Hopefully client just ignore his email.", "Thanks, I will. I'm also showing HR the email where he said cringe bc the client was in that thread. I guess I also have to tell his uncle (a long time employee here and the person who got him the job) and Owner soon - just so they know what happened from my end.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf one of the older staff hear him being rude at me, they tell him off (which thinking back now, might have gotten him angrier). The older guys here treat me well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe other new hires stay silent or laugh at Jack's bad jokes. I guess they wanna get on his good side because they also think he'll get uncle's position and he'd be their senior. I can see what you mean that it can ruin good workplaces. Especially since two of our  older guys are also retiring in the next 2 or 3 years.", "First job after college and getting licensed. I don't think he worked when he's a student because his uncle paid for all of Jack's generation who wanted to be in their uncle's profession. His uncle also got the owner to hire Jack as a favor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's not allowed to access the computer that has the budget info. We're a small company with less than a dozen employees in SEAsia so the HR and Payroll personnel has a desk in the same open area as we do. Meetings that need privacy are held in the Owner's office. We never had an issue about sexism before, so when I saw comments about him being sexist, I guess it's only now I'm thinking he's being rude to me because I'm female. I thought it was just because everyone in the office has a degree and license in the field. HR has a degree too. I didn't graduate.", "Everyone in the office has at least a 4 year degree except me. So out of anger, first thing I thought about is the pay. No day passed by without him mentioning that I'm not qualified to work with them because I didn't graduate.  My intent (out of anger) was to undermine his 4 year degree and his license because I was able to get higher salary without them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI actually didn't report to HR or the owner at first because I know Owner will fire him on the spot (he has daughters in the work force and the youngest decided she wanted to work in restaurants first while thinking what to take for college, if Owner hears about his attitude towards those w/o degree, he'll be livid). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nJack's uncle got him the job here, and his uncle is great. I didn't want to be awkward with his uncle if I got Jack fired. Now that I'm thinking about it more, his uncle has higher chances of disinheriting Jack if he finds out about this than make excuses for him. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not a side chick. Owner has an awesome wife and I'm on the asexual spectrum.", "Fair, I talked without thinking and just let it all out. For added info, he's a nepo baby (if I'm using that term right). Jack's uncle convinced Owner to hire him as a favor. His uncle is a great guy in the office and he's retiring soon. Wanted Jack to learn and take over his (Uncle's) position. Like, \"this career has been on our family for generations and I want Jack to continue our legacy\" type of thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo Owner and Uncle asked me to take care of him since Owner is usually off-site. Jack has made it known that he won't listen to me because I don't have a degree and license that he does.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe's been trying to change everything in the office to suit his needs because he expects that he'll take over Uncle's position. (Owner told me and Uncle that he will hire only, Uncle's position will be given to whoever brings the best performance for clients since his Uncle has been that man for us for the last few years). Owner always tell me to run the company the way he would.", "Fair. I'd be lying if I say I didn't get a momentary satisfaction when his face went so red with the thought that he's earning less than me tho.", "Just so you are aware, Comic Sans looks best if it is outlandishly large and very pink or purple. \n\nYou know what to do lol", "Yeah, he sneaked into the Payroll personnel's desk and snooped around while they were away from. He's the first one to go snooping on another person's PC here. This is a small company with less than a dozen employee. I expect to hear our HR/Payroll muttering angrily tomorrow because for the longest time, their job was all about taxes, benefits, etc only. Now they have a problem child with a list of offenses.", "You explained it well enough.\n\nNew employee Jack has no business telling you and other senior co-workers how to do your job properly.\n\nIf you have been using formula ABCD since forever and youre getting good results, there is no reason for you to go to ACD, especially not on the authority of ahem, new employee Jack. Not to mention, your client would be expecting ABCD.\n\nNow if Jack can't do ABCD and wants to cut corners, then that's his problem. I'm sure there would be a learning curve on the job and Jack, at first, would have problems doing exemplary work while he's getting used to the process but that's NOT a reason to be cutting corners and pulling bully behaviour. What Jack needs to do is to step up and get on the standard.", "Please take the time to to document these incidents. He sounds arrogant enough to hang himself but it never hurts to protect yourself from unjust accusations", "So true! That is also a huge insult to owner and his wife I didn\u2019t even think about that - what a d*ck", "This is his first job out of college that he only got purely through personal connections and he's trying to tell his senior of 10+ work experience how to do the job? The absolute audacity of this dude. You deserve every cent of your salary and sounds like he deserves none of it. If he's trying to cut corners and disregard regulations... \nStill NTA", "I totally get it, given that he was clearly in the wrong here and that you\u2019ve put up with this for some time, it\u2019s understandable that you couldn\u2019t help but be a little petty in the moment. We\u2019re all only human, after all. \n\nI\u2019d try to make sure you keep the pay comments to a minimum going forward, though. While I hope that everyone else is nicer than that guy, knowing that someone makes more than you can inspire resentment, even if you don\u2019t show it, and that\u2019s not particularly great for building good working relationships. You might\u2019ve set off a chain reaction here that could make it harder for you to work with some of your colleagues, at least for a while.", "some people has their fragile ego attach to material things.", "Now I'm also researching if there's a way to make it pink/purple gradient and very sparkly.", "Will do. I'm not sure how much  some hearsay will hold, but I'm talking to one of our older guys here about how I wanna bring this up to Jack's uncle. He's saying I should ask jack's Uncle to demand to see Jack's phone and the videos he recorded. Apparently, when they were waiting for a client in a restaurant, Jack was sneakily recording another female customer who was eating and making very rude and lewd comments as she takes bites of her food. That happened on company paid time.", "Now youre talking my language!", "Oh gross. Is Jack's uncle someone who has power in the company? Unless he is, there's no reason to get him involved in what happens on paid company time, but you should encourage the other co-worker to go to HR with the knowledge of the videos. *Especially* if they were on a company phone, as well.", "Jack's uncle is a long time employee, he's very well liked by clients and people in our office. He handle the important projects that costs the most.  He asked Owner to hire Jack as a favor to him that's why I think I should keep him up to date. In our work spaces this part of SE Asia, you have a social responsibility on who you refer to be hired by the company (especially since Jack is a family member).  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am not sure if he used a company phone or his personal phone."]}
