{"id": 29572, "submission_id": "17ffka6", "title": "AITA for no longer defending my ex-husband to our adult children?", "selftext": "Title pretty much says it all. My(39f) ex-husband (43m) and I divorced almost 2 years ago. We have 2 children who are now 18(f) and 21(m). One of our issues when we were married was that I felt my ex wasn\u2019t very involved with the kids as they grew into adolescents. As younger children, he was fantastic, but as they got older and needed more discipline/structure and had typical teenage moods/behaviors, he was just kind of there. When our kids did approach him for things he would often get irritated or seemed on edge. Our kids would often come to me and express how they feel their dad wasn\u2019t very approachable or they felt like they were a bother to him. I expressed this to him many times and encouraged him to maybe do quality time with each kid, as well as talk with them about this. I told him that he only had \u201cx\u201d amount of time with them before they would be gone and how much this could hinder their future relationship. The kids would also say bad things about their dad and I would always correct them or defend their dad. \n\nWell fast forward to now. He often complains about how little the kids call or see him. That he doesn\u2019t feel important to them, that they care very much, and how much it hurts him, etc. Now I don\u2019t remind him about our talks I will just say, \u201cWell maybe try reaching out more\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re just busy living their lives\u201d. The 18yo is away at college and the 21yo moved out when we sold out house during the divorce, so he\u2019s been on his own for almost 3 years. I\u2019ve asked the kids about now seeing their dad and they say not so great things about him except now I don\u2019t correct or defend their dad. I don\u2019t join in, but I don\u2019t discourage it. I feel like they\u2019re adults who are expressing their frustrations and emotions regarding how their dad\u2019s behaviors impact them and how hurt they are by them. He can honestly be disrespectful of their feelings, pretty selfish at times, and self absorbed. \n\nI had a friend tell me that I shouldn\u2019t allow them to speak that way about their father and should instead encourage them to talk to him, which I do, I just don\u2019t defend him or tell them they need to stop, just that they should talk to him. Both kids however feel that ship has sailed because they\u2019ve attempted to off and on throughout the years and nothing changes. She also said that by me allowing it that I\u2019m essentially agreeing with them. Which I mean I do agree with them, I just keep my comments to myself. \n\nSo, AITHA, for allowing my kids to speak freely about their dad even if it\u2019s negative?", "created_utc": 1698161494, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ffka6/aita_for_no_longer_defending_my_exhusband_to_our/", "score": 121, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You can offer a listening ear, but it's not your place now to be a cushion between them and their father.", "NTA. Not saying anything doesn't mean you're agreeing, that's not how it works. I think you understood perfectly when you said they're adults now and entitled to their own opinions on their father's behavior.\n\nAlso, you're encouraging them to talk to their father already. What else should you do? Give an ultimatum? Again, they're adults, they make their own decisions.", "NTA.  Your ex has the relationship he's created with his kids.

As you say, the kids are adults and your ex needs to actually do the work to have a relationship with them", "NTA and your friend is wrong. You would be the AH to yourself to continue to coddle your exhusband and take on his emotional labor. A garden grows where you tend to it - maybe he should pull his head out of his behind and start making an effort towards his kids. I would stop talking to him about this. It's his responsibility and you're not his therapist or ambassador. \n\nAlso, you would be an AH to your kids to try and push them about this.

It's not your job to defend him to them anymore.", "NTA. Your friend sure is for telling you how to talk to your kids.  You are supporting them in their choice to blow their dad off.  It is what he did to them so why is he surprised?.  Keeping your mouth shut is saving you a lot of bull crap.

They are adults now and have their own feelings and opinions. And while before you tried to cover for him and smooth things out, he\u2019s no longer your husband and they\u2019re no longer children. He\u2019s his own person and it is on him to take care of his relationships", "NTA... Your children are grown and as adults they need to recognize the difference between an attentive partner and a selfish one. This is part of their development.  You dont need to bash your ex, you just need to listen and validate their feelings.", "NTA. what's wrong with agreeing with them...when they're right? Husband can't retroactively change the facts.", "NTA. Your kids are adults. Your relationship now is a support role, which you seem to be doing beautifully. If their dad wants a better relationship, that\u2019s on him to figure out with them.", "NTA and I will take this a step further. If you argue with your kids whenever they talk about their feelings, they will stop talking to you. Plus, in order to argue with them, you would have to lie and say he isn't that bad or that they didn't experience what they clearly remember.", "NTA - too often are kids told their feelings don't matter or they should keep them silent. You've given your ex the benefit of your wisdom and tried to help, but you can only lead a horse to water, you can't make him drink. He didn't do the work needed to build a healthy relationship with his older/now adult children, and that's something only he can work on improving. \n\nAllowing your kids to air their feelings is healthy. And it's better that SOMEONE knows how they feel, and that they know they can share those thoughts with you and trust that you'll listen and help where able/needed.", "NTA.  Your kids are adults who have formed their own opinions based on your exs behaviour.", "NTA - but your friend is an asshole for poking her nose where no one wants it.  Your ex ruined his relationship with his own kids and he's too selfish to realize it.  It's not your job to fix that relationship.  And I'm sure your kids respect and appreciate that they can talk about their feelings regarding their Dad and feel heard and not chastised.", "NTA. Your kids are adults, no longer under the rule of their parents (unless they live with you), so they can say whatever they want. I don't blame you for remaining silent; their grievances lie with their dad, not you & you're right to stay out of it. Your friend seems like one of those people who have the mentality of \"Faaamily!\", & doesn't understand that your ex emotionally abused your kids (being un-approachable to your own kids IS abuse). Also, you've earned the right to say, \"I told you so\", & the fact that you don't proves you're a good person.", "NTA.  Do not give him any more advice outside of \u201coh that\u2019s terrible.  Maybe you should talk to a therapist about this issue between you and the kids.  Anyway- ::cue subject change:: \u201c\n\nIf he keeps bringing it up maybe try something from out of this (it\u2019s way too long to use as a whole but parts can be picked from it to form a custom shorter response.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry about what you\u2019re going through but this is between you and the kids not me and you and the kids.  We are no longer married and this type of repeated long term issue you have falls under current partner support, not exes who keep in touch for the purposes of family get togethers with adult kids and other extended family support.  \n\nEven as friends this would be above my pay grade since I\u2019ve already given you all my advice that you either didn\u2019t act on or didn\u2019t work.  \n\nI would strongly suggest you seek out a professional 3rd party to help you work this problem out if it is important to you to have a better relationship.\u201d", "NTA, he is unhappy with the results of his own actions. My nibblings are in their 20s and my mother (their grandmother) complains to me that she barely has a relationship with them. I just respond with \"When they were growing up, every time I advised you to interact with them more, you refused. Now you see the outcome, and since I lack a time machine, there's nothing I can do.\" I think that reply works for your husband as well. As the adult, it was on him to build a relationship with his children and he failed. It's easier for him to blame his estrangement from his kids on you and other factors, but they are *his* children and *he* mishandled their feelings.", "No.  You are not the asshole.  Honestly, while I can see defending/making excuses for their dad's lack of involvement when they were younger, I'm not sure I'd be correcting them or stopping them from expressing their opinion at any age.  I would always encourage them to keep the door open in case their dad ever did decide to step up.  \n\nYour children are adults.  They are forming their own opinion based on behavior they've seen and experienced.  You should not be shutting them down.", "Nta at all....your friend has no emotional intelligence or maturity.", "NTA. By constantly telling your kids to hear their dad out or to cut him some slack when he lets them down it seems like you\u2019re invalidating their feelings. So you not defending their father anymore means you\u2019re standing up for your kids. At least that\u2019s what I think.", "I think maybe his hope is that I\u2019ll offer to talk to them or maybe give him insight as to why that\u2019s the case. Because he will ask how often I talk/see them and honestly it\u2019s pretty frequent. I don\u2019t hide how often I talk or see them and I can tell it bothers him. But you\u2019re so right, it\u2019s definitely his problem to solve. I tried for years to tell him and to help. He didn\u2019t listen", "I definitely agree. We kinda argued over it. I think for her she grew up where the parents just bashed each other and it was horrible for her but that\u2019s not the case here. I don\u2019t join in, I just listen and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry it\u2019s like that\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sorry to hear that happened\u201d to them", "We have a cordial/friendly relationship, we were together 17 years and I\u2019m still very close with his family. We also will talk on occasion regarding the kids still such as plans for birthdays, holidays, etc.", "Why is it weird to talk to the father of your children?  That shouldn't be something seen as weird.", "I just had to look to see if it was 'cats in the cradle\" or \"cat in the cradle\", either way.", "If he asks for insight into why they don't talk to him, you could ask him to repeat back to you any of the things you said over the years on the topic. If he can't, let him know that's his answer right there. He didn't care enough to pay attention, and they can see that. (If you want to put in the effort. If not, \"You're presumably a grown up, you figure it out\" is also a valid response)\n\nNTA", "NTA. I might add that unless your children are very dim bulbs, they can clearly see for themselves how their father does or does not interact with them. Your minimizing or excusing their father's behavior will simply put you in a bad light in their eyes, as well.", "One of my best friends is a guy to whom I was engaged.  I know that's a bit different, but same principle.  I think exes can make great friends under certain circumstances.\n\nMy parents, as dysfunctional as they were, were best friends.  In fact, my dad refused to divorce her even when he had a live-in girlfriend because he didn't want her to be removed from his health insurance.", "NTA.  Your kids aren't stupid.  They noticed a long time ago he didn't care, they saw through you defending him.  You told him many times, but he did nothing to change.  How can he act surprised this is the result.  Your kids can talk any way they like about their dad.  You can twist perception, reality won't budge."]}
