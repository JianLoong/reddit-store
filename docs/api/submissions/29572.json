My(39f) ex-husband (43m) and I divorced almost 2 years ago. We have 2 children who are now 18(f) and 21(m). One of our issues when we were married was that I felt my ex wasn\u2019t very involved with the kids as they grew into adolescents. As younger children, he was fantastic, but as they got older and needed more discipline/structure and had typical teenage moods/behaviors, he was just kind of there. When our kids did approach him for things he would often get irritated or seemed on edge. Our kids would often come to me and express how they feel their dad wasn\u2019t very approachable or they felt like they were a bother to him. I expressed this to him many times and encouraged him to maybe do quality time with each kid, as well as talk with them about this. I told him that he only had \u201cx\u201d amount of time with them before they would be gone and how much this could hinder their future relationship. The kids would also say bad things about their dad and I would always correct them or defend their dad. \n\nWell fast forward to now. He often complains about how little the kids call or see him.

I moved out in 2014 and the divorce was finalized a year later, and I just got remarried in Dec 2021. \n\nMy ex was a verbally and emotionally abusive alcoholic and would throw things when he was drunk.  After I left him, I spent YEARS defending him and making excuses for his behavior to my children, and encouraging them to keep the relationship with him intact.  I wouldn't say my son is a golden child to his dad, but my ex certainly treated him better than my daughter, who he flat-out neglected.  Even after she decided to live with me full-time and just go visit him for dinner once in a while (she was 15), I kept encouraging the relationship.  Even after she decided to go NC with her dad (she was 17), I encouraged her to reach out to him.  Finally, last year, she told me \"Mom, I get that you're trying to be supportive, but I don't want to see or talk to him.  If you think I need a positive male role model, I have my step-dad.\"  And I stopped at that point because I realized that I was subtly telling her that the neglect and emotional abuse he put her through shouldn't matter, that she should have a relationship with him anyways.  Which was 100% wrong of me.\n\nMy daughter talks to me sometimes about her dad, and some of the things that happened to her while she was there, and it breaks my heart to hear it.  But I would never tell her that she's not allowed to feel or think things.  And that's what your friend is trying to say.  They shouldn't feel that way.  They shouldn't think those things, and certainly shouldn't say those things.  Your friend needs to back up a LOT and keep her opinions to herself.  I'm guessing she's never been in your shoes, and certainly never in your kids' shoes.  Your children are allowed to express themselves.

Don\u2019t sacrifice your relationship with your kids bc your ex refused to parent in the rough years. And I find it funny that you\u2019re suppose to defend him to your kids, but not call him out on his shitty non-existent efforts with his kids when they were in their tween/teen years? \nNTA if you opt to say anything it should be to your ex.\n\n\u201cIf you want a better relationship with the kids, YOU need to make the effort and apologize for dipping out on the hard years. You cannot go years with no-minimal effort and then think when your kids become adults, you\u2019re going to have some incredibly close relationship.\u201d", "Or a woman's job to fix the relationship that the man screwed up."]}
