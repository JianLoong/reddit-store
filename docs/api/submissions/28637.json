It was way more than I wanted to pay for a single room but I figured it was quick, saved me the search and I could get right in. So on September 20th I agreed to move in on October 1st.

I asked him what he meant and he said our deal was \u201c$1600 every two weeks.\u201d I was livid and told him rent is always monthly. He said he was pretty clear over the phone and e-mail.

He said ok his compromise would be \u201c1300 every two weeks.\u201d I said that\u2019s utterly ridiculous to pay $2600 a month for a single room in a shared house and this was why I wanted to sign a lease. He said he would lose the house if I didn\u2019t pay $3200 a month but he was desperate so he would compromise.\n\nI told him now I didn\u2019t trust him and I was going to move out so I\u2019m in the process of finding a couch to sleep on and I keep getting calls from my family saying how I\u2019m leaving him \u201chigh and dry\u201d and I need to continue to work with him and my refusal to come to a further compromise or try to work something out with him is \u201cbreaking up the family.\u201d \n\nAITA for being done and not trying to work with him?", "created_utc": 1696945433, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/174llew/aita_for_not_compromising_with_my_cousin_after_he/", "score": 399, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can't afford his house, so he's trying to scam you into paying the difference. His refusal of documentation was\n the first red flag. I'd leave asap.\n\nDon't let him abuse you because you're \"family.\" If he truly thought like that, he would have never manipulated you in the first place.", "NTA. I think your inclination is correct and he is being shady. He refused to document the agreement and I'd have a REALLY hard time believing this was all incidental and a miscommunication. I think he pulled the rug out from under you, purposefully. \n\nAlso why would you know he pays his mortgage every two weeks? In my experience both rent AND mortgages are generally paid monthly. \n\nGet out as soon as you can. You are NOT leaving him high and dry. He is free to find another tenant with this same arrangement of $1600/2 weeks (but I doubt he'll be able to). It's sad to me that your family is all ganging up on you. Best case scenario, this was a simple misunderstanding and this is simply more than you want to or can afford to pay, in which case you still aren't screwing him over in ANY way.", "NTA - he is scamming you and you should tell the family he is cheating you. $2600 for a room in a condo is price gouging a family member.\n\nYou paid for the whole month. Move out and find another place.", "NTA.  Your cousin is swindling you, you need to get out.  How on earth did he qualify for the property if he still is $3200 short on the mortgage every month?", "NTA\n\nYour cousin just hustled the hell out of you. There's no way the rest of your family knows what's really going on if they think you're \"leaving him high and dry.\" I'm assuming he's selling himself to them as some sort of magnanimous savior while trying to fleece you for everything you've got. Absolutely sickening behavior. $1600 a month for one bedroom is outrageous, especially for a family member in need, and $3200 is mind boggling.\n\nGet out, find a place for half the cost, and leave your cousin to lose his house. He doesn't deserve your help after trying to manipulate you like that and essentially stealing the first $1600 from you.", "NTA....farthest thing from that. I loved in San Diego up until 6 years ago so I know rent is high, but your cousin is a huge AH. Looks like he's trying to get you to pay the rent for him. I'd have left as well. There's a reason he didn't want to draw up a lease and I think he had this planned all along. Good on you for not being a doormat. Don't feel bad. You are not the reason he will lose his place....he is. Block him if need be and other toxic family members if you don't care to talk to them. 3200 to rent a room is too much. You can find your own place for that price. Once again stop feeling bad. You are not the AH, but he sure is by being deceitful and taking advantage of you. Good luck. I hope you find a place soon and have some good friends that will let you couch surf until you can secure a place.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\n>I keep getting calls from my family saying how I\u2019m leaving him \u201chigh and dry\u201d and I need to continue to work with him and my refusal to come to a further compromise or try to work something out with him is \u201cbreaking up the family.\u201d \n\nThis is beyond daft.

He is asking you for 1600 every two weeks?   So, his mortgage is at least 6000?  I find that hard to believe, but, even if it is, you are paying for a room, common area and bathroom.

Best of luck.", "NTA, this fing guy trying to get you to pay his whole mortgage for him.  I'd look up what rooms are going for in your area find a few examples and send him an email with comparable rooms, also send this email to any family members giving you stress.", "Absolutely NTA even after your edit.  I can't think of any court in CA saying that a landlord \"meant\" two weeks without that being spelled out.  (I was actually a landlord in CA for 10 years).  At the same time, I would stay the month and do anything I can to move out right after that - it can't be a comfortable living situation.  Plus it is creating so much strife within your family.

If this is in the US, the standard for rent is monthly, and the onus was on him to tell you if he meant something other than that.  It\u2019s like any other unit of measure.

Their mortgage for the exact same house would be $4,000 more than they pay currently based off that and it\u2019s what would be considered like a \u201cnormal house\u201d not super fancy or anything.", "3200 a month rent isn\u2019t insane (in general). But for a single room it sure is. My old townhouse we sold during covid is being rented for about that now. But if you are renting it your getting about 2100sq ft, a basement (unfinished) a single car garage, 3 BR, 2.5 bathrooms. And we\u2019re about 20 minutes from multiple beaches in NJ.", "Where the hell are you that mortgages are $400?! That is insanely cheap. I paid more to live in a converted closet in the 90s in my area. OP said it's a condo near the beach in socal. Even so, $3200 sounds closer to the entire amount rather than half though.", "It's California, so it is possible his mortgage is that much. My sister-in-law and her husband paid a million... for a small house.  It has 2 bedrooms and a garage.   Mine is about 2600 a month, I think.  But, in any case.  If he can't afford the mortgage, he needa to sell the hous.e", "At current rates that's like maybe a 50k mortgage. What are you supposed to buy for that?", "You can pay every 2 weeks without making an extra payment and you\u2019ll still pay it off faster than if you pay every month. Interest is calculated daily and applied monthly.", "A 1.3 million mortgage with bi weekly payments is 5500 per month at a decent rate.  If he\u2019s on a floating rate it could be 8-10000 per month.  \n\nI\u2019m\nGuessing he\u2019s the latter.", "It doesn\u2019t matter, no bank would give a mortgage that large to someone that couldn\u2019t afford it and even then, 3200 a month would be more than half the mortgage on a 800k property.", "It's almost definitely one of three things: A very old mortgage, a very small/cheap house, or a rural area with incredibly low cost of living. \n\nI worked mortgages across most of the US for several years before the housing market imploded in 2022 and I don't think I ever saw a monthly THAT low even with 1% APR.", "I live in a Pennsylvania city. One bed, one bath with a large basement, and a nice big yard. I lucked out.", "Detroit?", "A shoe box in Nebraska.\n\nhttps://oldhousesunder50k.com/c-1890-nebraska-tiny-house-for-sale-under-50k/", "You're just making an extra payment without the flexibility to decide whether or not to make it. You're not somehow better off having the extra payment added in to start.", "I mean it's possible that Cousin either lost his job or bought the house with a SO who has moved out so he's now responsible for the entire mortgage, but that doesn't make a single room worth $3200/month.\n\nEspecially when you intentionally have to trick someone into trying to get them to pay it.", "You\u2019re right 2008 never happened and certainly isn\u2019t still happening", "Probably all of the above. Still shocked someone would use this as a frame of reference. You gotta know that's basically unheard of", "Well good for you, that sounds amazing!", "No, the timing of this matters. Every two weeks ends up on paper as an extra payment but the  prevented interest is \"accrued\" with every payment.", "The point is, its unrealistic for many reasons.\n\nWhy did the guy ever think that he could afford a $6400 a month mortgage? Why would he have paid that much for a condominuium? Why would a bank have given him a loan on such a stupid purchase? Those are three separate idiotic choices that have no immediate explanation.", "Yeah it's possible there are extenuating circumstances I'm not thinking of, but it just reeks as being out of touch. Like maybe he put half the house down on a down payment? But then you should have the wherewithall to be like oh, my mortgage isn't 800 a month *because I paid for half of it up front*"]}
