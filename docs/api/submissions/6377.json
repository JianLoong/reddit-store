It will be tough, but very very worth it. - from a recovered bulimic.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it very graciously. If you were to do anything differently I suppose perhaps asking for a receipt so you could exchange for a more appropriate gift would have been \u201cbetter\u201d but judging by her response, probably not. Who hears of an ED and calls that person rude for working on recovery\u203d I\u2019d be wanting to know how I could support that person, not be sulking about a returned gift!", "NTA.", "NTA. You are doing exactly what you need to do to get better; and frankly your aunt and her pearl clutching reaction can get stuffed. As an aside, since you now seem to be stuck with a scale that you do not want; perhaps you can choose to re-purpose it into something useful. With your mothers permission (and involvement if she wants), take that scale out back and smash the absolute shit out of it with something heavy. Take back your power over it!", "NTA youre aunt is the one who is being weird and disrespectful.", "NTA. Any normal person would have responded \u201cI had no idea, I\u2019m so sorry for the misunderstanding. Yes, please feel free to return and I wish you luck in your recovery!\u201d Your message was very polite and respectful. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong here. Don\u2019t blame yourself for her bizarre and insensitive reaction. Take care of yourself.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t rude. Get well soon", "No, OP. You weren\u2019t rude. NTA. Regift it or donate it. All the best on your recovery. And a happy new year.", "You might have gotten this advice already but seriously: tell your mother and let her deal with your aunt. You are a child, in recovery, you shouldn't have to argue with a grown-\\*ss woman about an inappropriate gift. Don't even reply to her if you can help it and show it to your mother so she can deal with it accordingly. \n\nObviously NTA.", "Throw it in the trash. You don't need a scale in your house and your aunt is a... words I can't say.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n\"Smash that bitch of a scale.\"", "op=NTA\n\nbut next time just donate it to local thrift shop.", "NTA it wasn't that you told her the gift was stupid or ugly or in any way insulted it. You explained that you have a serious condition that is in conflict with the gift. You explained wanting to return the gift, giving the reason. \n\nI am so sick of people telling younger people that they are being disrespectful when the person is simply stating a boundary.", ">Should I have told her?\n\nConsidering her response, the answer to this question is No, you shouldn't have told her. NTA OP, it was completely not rude of you to let her know you couldn't use the gift but you should have just asked for a gift receipt. Also, let your mom know about your aunt now knowing, she needs to be aware of this ASAP.", "This!  \n\n\nNTA OP, but please learn from this and dispose of unwanted gifts without telling the giver. Not knowing you left your scale at Goodwill would have left your aunt with one less excuse to be abusive.", "JFC. This comment reeks of ignorance. \n\n- Tracking weight is an extremely triggering thing for many patients with anorexia. Would you hand an alcoholic a bottle of sherry for Christmas and tell them to \"just use it for cooking cause alcohol isn't just for getting drunk\"? \n\n- She needs inpatient treatment because wanting to recover doesn't just mean everything is good and you start eating again and the problem magically disappears. She needs help. That's like telling an addict \"if you want to quit drugs, I don't know why you need to go to rehab.\"  Accepting that she has a problem doesn't make the problem go away. \n\n- Someone with a BMI of 12 requires intense medical supervision to start gaining weight to avoid re-feeding syndrome, and the help of a registered dietician to learn how to eat and plan meals again. People literally die starting to eat again after long periods of fasting.  Look up how many prisoners died after the concentration camps were liberated because they'd been starved and their bodies couldn't handle the sudden increase in food. \n\n- A BMI of 12 does indeed put someone at risk of organ damage. But BMI doesn't take everything into account -- she's still a teen, and also she probably has shitty bone mass due to her illness. It's not unusual to see in young patients with severe anorexia. Again, that's why treatment is necessary. \n\n- Telling close family members about your illness and your triggers is an important part of recovery. Family can't be supportive of they don't know what the problem is and how to help. \n\n- She may well be \"on her way to death,\" anorexia has the highest mortality rate of any psychiatric illness. That's why she needs treatment, not some internet know-it-all (who clearly doesn't actually know shit) calling her a \"skeleton.\"\n\nIf you had the time to Google BMIs, maybe take the time to Google anorexia nervosa before being a jerk about it to someone who is struggling.  I hope no one close to you ever has to contend with a mental illness, because my God are you judgmental for someone so profoundly ignorant about them.\n\n\nEdit - many typos", "What's wrong with needing attention?\n\nSeriously. Animals need attention. Plants need attention. Babies need attention. Why do you think adults don't?", "Regrettably, the whole 'thin=pretty' thing leaves some people unable to see what's in front of their eyes.", "When you\u2019re good with contouring makeup and discreet about how you dress it\u2019s not difficult to hide; I did it for years.", "You'd think so, but the whole \"thinner=healthier\" is incredibly ingrained in people. \n\nI'm not saying overweight is healthy.  But I was healthier at my heaviest weight than my thinnest,  because at least my hair wasn't falling out and my period hadn't fully stopped.\n\nAnd yet, that was when I got the most compliments. Not when I finally got myself to a healthy, \"normal\" weight, but when I was deep in the throws of disordered eating.", "You sit here and hang on every word someone says. I blame the people around her who are ignorant to the fact this person is withering away and they have no clue. Which sounds like op is lying. Because how is that possible. My comment is staged to gain information around the ops truthfulness.  You go ahead and believe everything you read online and hang onto it all. You over there with your rose coloured glasses.\n\nEdit for clarity:\nIf someone in my life has an actual mental issue i will get to the bottom of it and be compassionate and help. Someone on a AITA sub reddit with all this crud to say ,  and it has to do with a gift and how she tells the gift giver she has anorexia sounds very fishy.\n\nEdit cause YTA: if i had the time to check about a BMI to see if someone is lying. Which took about 30 seconds, then i have time to study about the entire anorexia eating disorder as a whole...  stfu. That in itself is absolute rubbish. YTA.", "We are talkin about a bmi of 12. Organ failure territory, skeleton looking. Skin sagging on bones. Unless she just says a bmi of 12 but she really has no clue and its not that bad.", "Our society is so screwed up. I\u2019m sorry.", "Aunt might get her a new one. OP did the right thing in being honest. Aunt should not have taken it personally.", "No one in your life wants you to \"get to the bottom\" of their mental illness."]}
