Not you. \n\nThis being said,\n\nI wouldn't have even told my aunt and just donated it to a goodwill or the like, but I understand the need to reach out and inform.

She was saying the act of returning a gift to the sender was rude which historically is considered poor manners. Aunt is obviously a little old school and set in her ways."]}
