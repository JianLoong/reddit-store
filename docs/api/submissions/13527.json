It's mostly just coffee cups and silverware but still, it's a gross habit and I think it's really rude. We had a meeting about it a few weeks ago and our director made it clear he expected us to behave like adults and clean up after ourselves or there would be consequences.\n\nNothing changed and I was getting super pissy about there being a full sink whenever I wanted to wash my lunch container out and clearly nothing anyone was saying was making a difference so I just started washing dishes and leaving them in the dish rack. I did this for about a week.\n\nOn Monday\\*\\*, someone walked into the breakroom while I getting ready to wash all the cups and saw me. He asked if I had been the one washing everything and I said yes. I was surprised when he got mad and said I shouldn't be doing that, no one liked it and it was weird that I was taking it upon myself to touch their personal items. So I stopped at the moment and when I went back to my cubicle, he had told everyone in the area and they all agreed that I should have never touched their stuff and that i was violating their \"boundaries\".\n\nI was really fking annoyed at this point because I don't understand how they feel like they have the right to leave a common space filthy and get mad at someone else fixing it but I just thought \"okay, bet\" and went and told the director that the improvement he noticed and commented on? All me. And my coworkers didn't like it so I would not be continuing.\n\nI thought he'd be a little angry about it but he got furious. He came in and announced to everyone that they had 5 minutes to get their shit out of the sink and in the future, all abandoned items would be trashed immediately.\n\nI saw 4 people digging their mugs out of the trash yesterday morning and 3 today and they called me a rat bitch who couldn't mind her business which I also reported them for :) and they were in a meeting with HR this afternoon. Haven't seen them since.\n\nMy boyfriend says I'm being petty but I really like my job and would rather these assholes get fired and replaced with real adults. But he thinks if I hadn't set the expectation of the dishes being washed for that week by taking it on myself, my boss probably wouldn't have blown up like that because there wouldn't have been any \"big sudden reveal\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdited because I messed up my timeline a little.", "created_utc": 1680125689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1261g12/aita_for_doing_the_dishes_in_the_breakroom/", "score": 227, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who just leaves dishes to sit then melts down when someone is kind enough to wash their dishes for them?  I don't blame your director for getting so mad. He saw the improvement and thought everyone was pulling their weight, but they weren't.  You were trying to be a kind coworker by just doing dishes (which I personally would scold you for!
