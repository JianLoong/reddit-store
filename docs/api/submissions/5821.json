She was the result of a one night stand so her father (Sam) and I were never together. But he was very adamant about being apart of her life. We share custody evenly and for the most part coparent very well.\n\nThe problem right now is in regards to my husband (Tom) who I met when my daughter (we\u2019ll call her Allie) was around one. We married earlier this year. We\u2019re fortunate enough that he\u2019s able to be a sort of stay at home husband and on the days we have her, he takes care of her until I get home from work. \n\nHe loves that Allie with all his heart, treats her like his own blood. So naturally she sees him as a father figure. We hadn\u2019t been encouraging her to call him dada but when she did it he was so over the moon and it didn\u2019t even cross my mind to correct her.\n\nWell earlier today when Sam dropped Allie off at our house, she ran straight to Tom and yelled daddy. In all the time I\u2019ve known him I\u2019ve never seen Sam so pissed off. And hurt. He didn\u2019t say anything in front of Allie but he called me later and blew up. \n\nI\u2019ll make one thing clear; Sam is an excellent father. I would never purposely try to diminish that. It\u2019s just that Tom has also taken on a very fatherly role in Allie\u2019s life and I think that should be recognized. The thing I\u2019m struggling with is that I know I would probably be a little uncomfortable with Allie calling another woman mom at first but if she loved my girl as much as Tom does I\u2019d get over it.\n\nI just am really conflicted.

Does he refer to himself that way?  My guess is that you have based on the above comment which makes YTA since you made the decision unilaterally.   I think this was something that you should have talked over with Sam when you got married.  If he was uncomfortable with your daughter calling your new husband dad, then it would be your job to refer to your husband as Tom.  Children typically call people by the name they are referred to which is why really small children sometimes call their parents by their first name or honey because that is what they hear their other parent calling them.", "Her dad is her dad and he very much deserves that title and to be called that. Tom is not her dad and she should be encouraged to call him anything but that. And how do you know that you\u2019d get over your daughter calling another her mom? Oh, that is right, you wouldn\u2019t know that because it is Sam in that position and not you. Get over yourself and play fair. Taking on a fatherly role in someone\u2019s life doesn\u2019t make you their dad and that statement is you trying to justify your actions. Your daughter needs to grow up knowing the reality and then she can make her own choice what to call Tom. You think it is cute when she calls your husband dad and are encouraging it. I don\u2019t blame Sam for being pissed.", "Yta she didn't pick that up by herself.  OP states they activated encouraged it.  Your husband isn't her dad. He's her step dad. She has an involved and living dad.  You should have re directed that first time and now you've made it that much harder to redirect now.", "Yta,\nBecause I think the most obvious answer is your husband calls himself that to her.  You are the AH because the first time she did it you should have said no he is (some other title)  and I hope Sam gets married and your daughter calls her mom.", "YTA. My stepson was 3 when I first came in the picture and he had never called me mom because I was never called mom in front of him. As the years have gone on both my stepkids call me my name or stepmommy when they really want something lol \n\nThere is no way that child made that leap without some nudging. Now if you want your husband to be recognized in some way there are plenty of other names then Daddy especially when her bio dad is completely involved in her life", "YTA, you didn\u2019t tell the father of your child that she was calling a random man dad.", "YTA\n\nSince your daughter has an involved father, granting that name to a stepparent should have been discussed with him. Allowing him to be blindsided was really unfair and hurtful.\n\nLittle Allie is old enough that she and Tom can choose a unique nickname for him together, something she doesn\u2019t use with her present, involved, affectionate father.", "This is one of the hardest ones I've seen!  At first I was NAH, but maybe a soft YTA for you. \n\nIMO,  this is something you should have discussed with Sam and that should still happen.

Being called \u201cdad\u201d or \u201cmom\u201d is not something an involved, bio parent takes lightly, and you just made it clear to Sam that he\u2019s replaceable. \u201cPop\u201d or some other parent-type label isn\u2019t hard to do! I think you\u2019ve just done some permanent damage to your previously amicable relationship with Sam, and for what? She doesn\u2019t care what she calls people\u2014that came from you. Ugh.", "YTA\n\nIt is absolutely hurtful. Sam is not a deadbeat.", "YTA, but I only say that for the sake of the sub - because I don\u2019t think you are truly an asshole per se, but I do feel Sam has been wronged here.  \n\nI have two young kids and if I were divorced and found out my kids were calling another guy \u201cdad\u201d that would break my heart to a million pieces while also pissing me off beyond belief.", "YTA \n\nMany courts regard this as a form of parents alienation. Now that you know he has an issue, create a nickname for stepdad.", "YTA. You should have talked it out with Sam before you encouraged it. He should not have found out that way dropping off his kid.", "INFO: In what way did he \u201cblow up\u201d?", "I'm going to go with YTA", "This is a tough situation I'm not sure how to rule this but I think maybe softly ESH but the dad. I can't blame him for being hurt and angry .", "I\u2019m going to say NTA, people call step parents mom/dad ect when the parent has taken on that role. She\u2019s a young kiddo what is she supposed to call your husband, Tom? That seems odd to me. You said yourself you could get over Allie calling another woman mom if she loved your daughter as much as Tom does. Maybe when she\u2019s older she will call Tom something else, maybe Tom could be \u201cdad\u201d and Sam \u201cdaddy\u201d or something along those lines. The other option is correcting her calling Tom dad, but she\u2019s quite young and probably won\u2019t grasp the concept yet", "YTA you are encouraging her to call your husband dad. Her dad has every right to be upset. You are in the wrong and it\u2019s easy to get on social media saying you be uncomfortable but would get over it if she called another woman mom. I seriously doubt that. Your husband isn\u2019t her bio dad. Her bio dad is very much in her life. Pretty sure this could be seen as parental alienation. If bio dad wanted to he could use this in court against you.", "Hmm tough 1 probably a soft YTA I can imagine it must have been very hurtful for Sam to hear his daughter call someone else Dad, you probably should have discussed with him 1st what she would call Tom. Allie is a very lucky girl to have 3 parents in her life who love her this much.", "Soft YTA, what about making up names that differentiate between biological dad and stepdad? Something like daddy and \u201cPoppa\u201d\nAnd what about when he gets married. If he ever does. Would you be OK with your daughter calling her mom? I kind of doubt it so it would be to your benefit to get this straightened out amicably as soon as possible.", "Yes, YTA.  At that age it should be made clear to her who Dad is, and who Mom is.  Come up with a special different name, like Poppa Tom.", "NTA but you should have told Sam earlier so he could process it", "I can assure you that you're NTA. My mother allowed my little sister to call the kindergarten teacher mom, because she was sent to kindergarten early. Children will recognise the more important people in their lives very early and it's ok if she has two dads", "I\u2019m going to say NAH \n\nDo you have a good enough relationship with Sam for you to have a good chat about this? If so, have a sit down with him about the future. Talk about how you are sorry that he got surprised by it they way he did, and looking back at the situation you\u2019ve realised that if the roles were reversed, you would\u2019ve also been hurt to hear your daughter call another woman \u201cmom\u201d. But, you both also need to be realistic. Because whilst you can work with your husband to change the name your daughter uses with him, it\u2019s not going to change the fact that in her eyes, he is another father figure. That doesn\u2019t diminish Sam as her father, or anything that he does for her. Really listen to how he\u2019s feeling about the situation, and try and figure out together the best way to move forward. Obviously trying to convince your daughter that your husband isn\u2019t a second dad to her isn\u2019t realistic given his role in her life\u2026but at the same time telling him to suck it up and get over it isn\u2019t the best way to move forward together either. \n\nShe\u2019s still young, and this move to call your husband \u201cdad\u201d is new. So why not ask propose that you find a nice nickname for your husband that your daughter can use. Something special that only she calls him (it may help if he has a special nickname that only he calls her - help with the bonding process). That way she knows that they have a special bond, but it\u2019s different enough not to push Sam\u2019s buttons every-time he hears it?", "I mean, NAH because you haven't coached her to call your husband that. He's being a father figure, and she is cottoning on to that fact. Having two solid father figures is pretty dang great for her IMO, as long as they don't squabble in front of her, or make her choose who is more important. Love multiplies, it doesn't divide. He's allowed to feel hurt, but it's not okay that he took it out on you, and he needs to be fully over it in front of his daughter.\n\nMy 3yo calls his aunt that he rarely sees \"Christmas Grandma\", and he called my husband's friend \"Grandpa\" when he grew out his beard which happened to be grey. He's not doing it to be hurtful, or make anybody mad. He's using words that he knows and building them into the framework of his own life. That's how language develops.", "INFO: What does Allie call Sam?", "NTA. This \u201conly one dad\u201d shit is toxic and needs to stop. She is lucky to have two men in her life who care and take care of her.  Just like if she had two women in her life.", "At least from what you've said, NAH. It doesn't sound like the naming situation was planned or intentional in the sense of demoting Sam or cutting him out. \n\nBut now that it's here, it needs to be dealt with. YWBTA if you don't respect and accommodate Sam's feelings. You need to have a talk with Sam about this and whether he could live with her calling the two of them at least similar things (one could be Daddy and one Papa, or whatever works for you all), and one with Tom about what he'd be comfortable with. And once there's a configuration everyone's ok with, all three of you model and reinforce it for your daughter. It shouldn't be too hard: little kids learn different endearments for their parents and each grandparent, or for two same-gender parents, all the time.", "My parents split when I was young-ish (around 6) and over the years I came to think of my stepfather as another dad. \n\nI was actually in my teens when I started referring to my stepfather as \u2018dad\u2019, but that\u2019s who he is to me. It doesn\u2019t change the fact that my bio father is also my dad. I just lucked out and have two dads. \n\nI\u2019d say NTA at this point, although a proper conversation with Sam is in order. But take it from someone who has what your daughter is lucky enough to have in terms of family - getting a bonus (step) dad doesn\u2019t make me love or think any less of my (bio) dad. I think if it\u2019s handled right, you, your husband and your daughter\u2019s father can give her the gift and stability of three people who are all her parents. What she calls you all shouldn\u2019t really matter, but if she wants to express her feelings by calling both her dads \u2018dad\u2019, I think that\u2019s really lovely.", "NTA. however, when she first did it you should have reached out to Sam to let him know, so he could process it on his own, not be smacked with it in real time.", "NTA \nTom Is her dad as well. You can have more than 2 parents. \nIt looks like Sam is feeling insecure, I know if one of my kids called someone else mum it would be a rough pill to swallow. But Sam needs to understand that just because Tom is her step father it doesn't mean he is getting replaced. That he will always be her Father and she loves him as well. More parents means more love for the child.", "NTA\n\nAllie has two dads. If Sam is offended by the idea, he needs to have a reality check and see that Tom is just as involved as he is.", "NTA. She basically has two dads at this point, both of which have equal importance. As long as they\u2019re both getting equal time with her there should be no problem with her calling Tom, who is a second dad to her, her dad", "NTA but it's a delicate and hurtful situation for the father so maybe you can encourage a different variation like pops or dada...", "NTA.  I have an adult friend who's father situation is almost identical to your daughter's.  She loves both her bio and step father and they her.", "I would say NAH. She gets to percive anyone as she wants, as long as it doesn\u2019t make THAT person uncomfortable. I get that he\u2019s angry and upset, so he\u2019s a light AH.", "NTA - but you need to make sure to check Tom's role quick. Step-dad does not equal Dad in any circumstances. He's your husband and that's it. No parenting decision should be made by him and that should be clear.   \n\n\nI think it's a bit natural but it is upon you to make sure she knows the difference, because we can all say step-dads will love equally, we all know they can't. It's 100% natural too, so not Tom's fault he's just your husband that's it.", "YTA. You see that this is hurting Sam and you\u2019re dismissing that. I think it\u2019s great that Tom is taking such a hands on role with in your daughter\u2019s life but he\u2019s not her dad. A father figure isn\u2019t the same as an actual father. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with Sam wanting there to be a distinction between who he is and who Tom is. There are other things that Allie can call your husband that would accurately describe his role in her life and she\u2019s old enough for you to coach her into calling him those things. You say that you and Sam haven\u2019t had any conflicts until this point so don\u2019t ruin that by ignoring his feelings on this issue.", "While this is all sweet and sentimental your taking advantage of a child.  While the bio dad isn't married he is sharing custody and has been raising her as well.  So another man comes in swoops in and can shower a 3 year old with full time care as SAHD of course the kid is going to be confused.  The bio father is father not Tom.  Tom is the step parent.  At least give her bio dad that much respect for all the dead beat dads in the world who don't care to make the kid understand step dad if you're going to give away bio title.  You're also dismissing the amount of financial times bio dad has been helping giving raising the child 50/50 and all the times he's taken care of her cleaned up skinned knees exc.  You're manipulating the situation.  If this kid gets older and realizes this a parent should never be forgiven for removing bio dad title from their lives and it's despicable.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "YTA. She picked it up somewhere and it\u2019s up to you to clear up any misconceptions she may have.

Not sure what lead to your daughter calling Tom dad, but it would be confusing to interfer at the moment if that's what they feel comfortable with. \n\nBut at the same it is very hurtful, so I understand Sam. I would definitely not like it as well. I do think Sam's reaction is over the top. It is not about what you do for your child, but how the child sees the people she has around.\n\nEdit, Sam is AH cause of his reaction being over top and making it your fault", "NTA.

Ultimately, at 3, she doesn\u2019t know any better. If you coerced or encouraged her into saying it then you would be the AH. You need to have a conversation with Sam and explain to him how it all unfolded and why you decided to let it play out the way you did.

This is a really sensitive thing and you should\u2019ve discussed it with Sam. If she wants a special name for Tom, then the three of you can choose that together. As she gets older, she can make a more cognizant choice about what to call Tom.", "YTA! She has a dad and it's not your husband. I'm sure if he encouraged her to call some other woman mom you would strongly object, and your attempt to justify this blatant violation by claiming you'd \"get over it\" if the same happened to you is disingenuous at best!", "I want to say a very soft YTA, but also Sam is a soft AH too.\n\nYour child is young so will see father figures as daddy. It\u2019s not a slight on Sam even though he feels it, which he does have a right to feel. \n\nDoes she attends a nursery/kindergarten setting? because parents all get somewhat dehumanised into just mother/father rather than actual names.

It's nice that she has a loving step father, but he should not be letting her call him daddy. That role is already taken.", "You're wrong. She has one dad and one step dad.
