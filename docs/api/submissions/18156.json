But once the energy picked back up I was back up on my feet dancing. There were like two other people on my row doing the same.

You're not in Houston, you're in Sweden. I don't know their cultural norms,  so you'll have to tell us.  If it's the cultural norm to sit, then you should sit.  However, if many people were also standing and dancing, then stand and dance.", "YTA.\n\nYou sang and danced to the concert as you do when in the States. That's fine when you're in the States, but you weren't in the States. You were in another country where it was clear to you from the start that people were sitting in their seats to watch.\n\nAs soon as you keyed in on that everyone remained seated to watch, and you were the only one up and about, AND someone asked you to sit early on? You should have sat your dance happy self down and stayed seated to watch until such time as you saw everyone stand. If they never do, you stay seated.\n\nThere are countries who watch concerts and sporting events in near complete silence. When in Rome...", "YTA - by your own admission, it was obvious that other people were not behaving like you wanted to. The fact that it might be acceptable some place else 8,000 miles away is irrelevant.", "YTA\n\nI'm not from the US but where I'm from it's seen as extremely rude and selfish to stand up during a concert in front of people who are seated behind you. In my country if you stand up in front of rows of seated people a steward will often come and ask you to sit back down; if you refuse, security could remove you.\n\nMany younger people who attend concerts accompanied by their parents/guardians, shorter people and disabled people would have their entire concert experience destroyed if you were to stand up in front of them. There are situations where people with limited mobility who cannot stand for long periods are seated at concerts too.\n\nIf you make the choice to stand up you are blocking the views of multiple people who also paid money to be there. You're free to sing and move around and have a good time, but actually getting to your feet and blocking the performance is extremely inconsiderate.", "Imagine if say a 6\u20196\u201d tall and 3\u2019 wide person stood in front of you the whole show\u2026\nYTA\nWhy I rarely see bands in sit down places.", "YTA. When you travel you use the customs in that country, not yours.", "YTA - now I don't know if there was a separate standing area but in all big venues I've been to there usually is and this is Beyonce...\n\nThat said you are a major asshole for standing in a seating area. You are an asshole if you do it in Sweden, America or anywhere.\n\nConsider that some people cannot stand for long periods of time but still want to see their favourite acts. Instead of getting a standing ticket you go seated and block their view because you want to dance. Asshole all the way.", "YTA\n\nIt's you who have to adapt the places your ways visit to the places you go to. Not vice-versa.\n\n**This is why everyone hates Us tourists** (and French ones)", "YTA\n\nLearn how to read the room. Way to go somewhere and be That Asshole American. Everyone was having fun except for the people you were blocking. Trying to force people to have fun the way you want to have fun is boorish and unacceptable. If this is how you behave when you are abroad, please stay in Texas.", "YTA. Learn to read the room, and also you did knowingly get in their way. They were there to see Beyonc\u00e9. Not you wailing and waving about. Be considerate.", "YTA If almost everyone in front of you is standing then it's ok and you have every reason to stand too.", "YTA. \n\nIf it's a seated show, you have to leave your seat and go elsewhere to stand. You don't just stand up when people are seated behind you. And after she asked you to please sit, you still got up again. You also saw no one else was on their feet so you knew it wasn't the norm.", "YTA. Read the room.", "YTA. Different areas have different concert etiquette. You need to follow the expectations of the place you are in.", "Cultural norms are a thing and they vary from culture to culture.", "YTA", "YTA.\nSocial norms matter here. You should\u2019ve clued in.", "YTA. I wish it would become the norm in the states that anyone not on the floor must remain seated. There are some shows I would choose to pay for floor tickets but others I just want to sit and enjoy the performance and an adult beverage.", "YTA. This must have been so annoying. Please don't sing along to a concert. People pay (a lot) to hear the artist sing, not you.", "YTA. This is exactly why people hate American tourists. When you\u2019re in another country, you adapt to their social norms.", "oof, u done messed up. i can fully sympathize with the frustration of the lady behind you. YTA", "YTA - you have to respect the concert culture where you are. people paid to see beyonce, not have their view blocked by you. if everyone was sitting down and i was stuck behind the one person standing, i\u2019d have also been furious.", "YTA", "YTA, it wasn\u2019t wrong for you want to sing and dance however it\u2019s beyonc\u00e9 and there was obviously a reason if nobody around you is standing. essentially you put all those people in a situation where they had to stand to enjoy the show", "YTA. Unfortunately some places have really lame rules but hey, you\u2019re there so you need to follow their rules and customs. Try to do a concert in the US next time if you want to party the way we do.", "YTA. You were in a room with seats and people sitting this wasn\u2019t a club or a festival concert people paid to be able to see her not watch you shake your ass and I\u2019m sorry but they paid to hear her sing not you. You could have been blocking the view of someone who couldn\u2019t stand like a person in a wheelchair. You need to learn how to read the room better", "YTA, different countries different customs\u2026you should have respected that\u2026\n\nI went to an Iron Maiden concert in Phoenix - the people where lame as fuck and didn\u2019t move at all\u2026but I respected that and changed my behavior to what the others did - staying seated", "NTA. All these people complaining about it should just sit their asses at home and watch concerts on YouTube. \n\nThese events are meant to be loud, lively and interactive. If the crowd isn't giving back to the performer, the performance will suffer.", "NTA, even if it is the norm there not to get up and dance, Bey actively encourages the audience to be involved/sing and dance so what did they expect lol??  Also - I\u2019m just guessing here/may be projecting my own experiences lol but that village comment just really doesn\u2019t sit right with me - are you poc, by any chance?", "NTA - this is a POP CONCERT. Standing up and singing is what everyone is expected to do!", "I think ESH due to the fact that what that woman said is giving heavy racism vibes. Based on your post history I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re black? Idc what anyone is doing, making racist commentary is unacceptable. \n\nThat being said, I think you need to read the room a bit. It sucks to have someone blocking your view and they did ask you to sit down once already.", "NTA. Who made them the fun police? Oh wait, it's Sweden. It's part of the culture to be stoic and anti-fun. You did nothing wrong. I'm glad you had fun.", "NAH. You were enjoying a concert the way you had previously experienced them. Clearly, everyone else was on a way different page. Next time, just recognize that if you go against the grain like that, you might ruffle some feathers.", "There's no judgement here for me.\nNo info.\nNo YTA\nNo NTA.\nNo NAH.\nNO ESH.\nI think this was just poor communication errors.\nSincerely, a girl who has only been to one concert-", "NTA, when it's Queen Bey, how can you not dance?

You decided your reactions were more important than respecting the people who were there to watch the actual talent and not you gyrating and caterwauling. You did what so many American tourists do and were an offensive irritant towards the locals followed by utter bafflement that your behavior wasn't appreciated, wanted, or expected. You forced everyone who paid to see the act, instead, watch you have your out of body experience while you went through the rapture. Did you refund their wasted money after you ruined their experience? Unlikely. Instead, you took your unearned indignation to the internet to drum up support for your unhinged behavior. Why travel if you're not taking anything in. Stay home if you can't control yourself when visiting. Your level of entitlement is the hallmark of so many US tourists that they are loathed globally.", "YTA - If the majority of the crowd is seated for a concert, you should remain seated as well. You were rude.", "YTA. majorly. YTA. As someone who has to be seated during concerts due to an invisible disability, I have had so many concerts ruined by people stood up in front of me dancing and screaming the lyrics so loud I can\u2019t hear the singer I paid to listen too!", "Yeah I understand that. At first I thought the crowd was just waiting to warm up and her to perform songs they were more familiar with. There were a few other people in my row dancing also. I think I was too caught up in the moment to process, along with Beyonc\u00e9 herself making comments about the lack of enthusiasm from the crowd like \u201cI can\u2019t hear y\u2019all\u201d and trying to get people to be more hype, the dancers were trying to get people to act more excited too. \n\nI kinda felt like I was being the cheerleader for my area to make everyone feel like it was okay to have fun, but that was a fail.", "Oh man, where are you from? It sounds great. As a 4'11\" person from the US, I can't stand concerts because I'm rarely able to actually see one, since nobody will sit tf down.\n\nStanding should be for standing-room sections.", "I didn\u2019t think about people with disabilities \ud83d\ude1e ugh I feel terrible", "Cultural norms aren't \"lame\" just because they don't agree with yours. If someone is disabled and can't stand why should someone else be allowed to block their view by not staying seated?", "Yeah, watching her perform at the other shows that are more lively her performance was noticeably even more fun.
