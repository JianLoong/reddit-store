It can be hard to read the room when you're super excited, but in general it's best to follow local custom.

The differences can make it really fun to see a favorite performer in new cities/states/countries -- the vibe changes so much depending on the type of audience you're a part of. (It doesn't sound like Sweden would be top pick for me--no offence , Swedes!) If you ever get a chance to see Beyonc\u00e9 in a South American country get yourself to that show! I saw one of my favorite bands in Brazil and it was a a life altering event. The crowd was \\*\\*hyped\\*\\* --super energetic and singing along to every song, full voice, even joining in for the instrumental bits! I've seen footage of some of their shows from Mexico city and seeing them there is now on my bucket list. I saw the same band perform in Berkeley, California was it was completely different but also life altering; the crowd was giving a level of attention and quite focus that I wouldn't have thought possible in a crowd that size -- until some of the faster songs kicked off and then the frenzy was amazing!

She really had the nerve to ask a black woman \u201cIs that how they act in your village?\u201d? Are you for real?

I have been to see rock concerts and dance to house music all around the US and Europe. This Beyonce tour is basically house music. If you are going to listen to house and electronic in England, in Italy in Isreal you are dancing. \n\nI think the issue is that Beyonce put out a house album and didn't accommodate for the obvious dancing that would ensue.

This is why most concerts these days have split seated and standing areas. If that's not available, the general rule of thumb, no matter your location, is go with what the majority are doing. If most people are sat down, then you remain seated. Which can really suck, especially when it's something like a gig with high energy music, but that's living in a society I'm afraid.

To be honest, I don't think Beyonce or any other artist could care if the audience sings and dances along for their show, because they're getting paid, and if they didn't like it, they wouldn't continue to perform in those countries.

If they can't do those things and it impacts other people, they're an AH.", "I understand, but not everybody attends these concerts to dance themselves. If OP wanted to dance, OP could have bought a ticket for the standing section.", "I think we all understand by now that you could not care less about other people. Congratulations on having no manners and no considerations for other people.", "Yeah idk why they replied to you lol you weren't saying to do it in Sweden you were responding to someone saying people who do that IN the U.S. suck too, but it's a common thing at US concerts. In fact I've never been to a U.S. concert were a majority of the people weren't standing. But if I was in another country and everyone was sitting you bet I'd be sitting too lol. Like its just common sense? But this chain wasnt even about that, they trippin lol.", ">YTA. You sang and danced to the concert as you do when in the States. That's fine when you're in the States, but you weren't in the States. You were in another country where it was clear to you from the start that people were sitting in their seats to watch.  \nAs soon as you keyed in on that everyone remained seated to watch, and you were the only one up and about, AND someone asked you to sit early on? You should have sat your dance happy self down and stayed seated to watch until such time as you saw everyone stand. If they never do, you stay seated.  \nThere are countries who watch concerts and sporting events in near complete silence. When in Rome...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is the comment the chain originates from, and it clearly references US vs the Rest of the World.\n\nAnd even if you dismiss that the addition of \"too\" at the end also makes the statement inclusive of other countries.", "Their comment fits into this chain though imo. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No - I personally don\u2019t think it is, but I was replying to the person who said it was the norm.  I am not from the US - I am from a country that thinks it\u2019s rude to block someone\u2019s view, a norm that I totally embrace.", "Y'all are the type of people to get mad at people smoking dope at Afroman gigs \ud83e\udd23", "I mean I've been to metal shows where a person in a wheelchair got crowd surfed. (By choice of course.) Disabled people like to party too.", "I am a disabled person and I cannot stand at concerts. People like this are selfish. If you have been kindly asked to sit down and you refuse, you are of course the asshole. The concert is not just for able bodied people.", "$$$$$$", "That's such horseshit bands care if their audience is enjoying their music have u ever spoken to a musician in your life? your second point is also really stupid just because a country doesn't have a good crowd doesn't mean you stop preforming there bc there is still this cool economic concept called demand which means that people in Sweden want her to come and preform or else she wouldn't", "She definitely likes the crowd standing more \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Never read something so outta pocket. Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", ">Bands I want to impose their ideology, they are there to spread their music and make money.  \n>  \n>Just because you think your own selfish entitled behavior supersedes literally other countries, doesn't mean that your \"idols\" think that. You're just a pawn there to feed them and unlimited stream of money.\n\nThis is depressingly cynical and I strongly, strongly encourage you to go meet and get to know some actual musicians before you make assumptions about their motivations for playing live.", "you sound like you came straight from fox news. Artists tend to enjoy the art that they create and want to share it not out of political motives but because of their love of art. For that same reason musicians like crowds that are dancing because they can see people enjoying the music. It's selfish of you to force people to stop doing what they enjoy because you don't also enjoy it. look in the mirror your steaming with hypocrisy.", "Okay, I see that now, but would it make people with adhd AHs if they cant sit still during a concert, or what would be a pass?", "I am literally 17, and you are mad I wanna know why they'd be looked down upon... Honestly, there are people who have the ability to read the room, and there are others that havent been raised to get that ability, and they may just think the others dont want to dance, and it wouldnt be a bother if they did..", "So you're saying that the people who do want to dance shouldn't because some people don't? it sounds like those people who don't want to dance should not go to dance concerts anymore if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes", "Oh no, standing in a almost entirely seated show is also incredibly rude. \n\nWant to stand or sing or do all the things that you think don't escape your personal bubble? Fine. Go to the back row.", "Are you a famous singer that I paid hundreds of dollars to see perform? No? Than shut the fuck up. \n\nAlso, I smoke weed (a LOT) even occasionally at concerts, but yes, if you are smoking in an enclosed space with hundreds of other people, you are annoying the fuck out of someone around you.", "Yeah, my wheel chair kid has missed a lot of finales and encores because of the asshats standing in front. Usually my mama bear voice is enough to get them to sit back down, but it doesn't work on drunks. Especially at sporting events. I hate how many 3-2 pitches he's missed. It's probably a good thing that they don't let me bring a cattle prod into the stadium.", "Aw you're welcome! I'm glad you're digging yourself deeper into your own echo circles! I guess next you're going to be defending all of our school shootings next? Because America can't do no wrong? \n\nKeep being you, boo \ud83d\ude18", "Speaking as an adult with ADHD, it\u2019s on us to minimize the disturbance we cause to other people and avoid situations we know we can\u2019t handle. \n\nKids are constantly being put in situations where they have no control over their environment, but as an adult, if you know you can\u2019t behave appropriately in a given situation, you avoid that situation.", "I have ADHD and no it's not a pass.\n\nIf you have one of the few disorders that physically can't be controlled like tourettes then you need to plan for that picking a seat on the edge of the section and being willing to move.\n\nYour inability to control yourself (whether your fault or not) shouldn't be anyone else's problem.", "No, I'm saying that people who want to dance should purchase a ticket in the section appropriate for dancing.", "You literally sound so depressing \ud83e\udd23 \n\nMind yo own business and don't hate on people trying to enjoy their life."]}
