You forced everyone who paid to see the act, instead, watch you have your out of body experience while you went through the rapture. Did you refund their wasted money after you ruined their experience? Unlikely. Instead, you took your unearned indignation to the internet to drum up support for your unhinged behavior.

But, clearly this crowd wanted a more laid back approach, and you did pay for seated spots. After being asked once you probably should\u2019ve remained seated for the rest of the show.

You were definitely a huge a-hole to the people around you, but it is not easy to adapt to swedish culture and that cuts you slack. \n\nI am swedish, born and raised, and have many American friends.

Americans are (as far as I have seen, I am by no means an expert) loud, happy, extroverted and energetic while swedes are quiet, reserved, respectful of space, and frankly often quite boring. \n\nWatching american artists preform for swedes is always interesting, since they expect applause and such often while swedes are more \u201csit still, be quiet and only clap when the show is over\u201d. \n\nSo I feel for you, we swedes must be so boring to be around when you come from a culture where dancing in the seat is common, so I don\u2019t think you are an a-hole person, you just acted like one in the eyes of a swede\ud83d\ude05", "YTA.\n\nI get it, that sounds miserable.

Don't be that person. This is why everyone hates us.", "Leaving judgments to others but just want to let you know that some of us are sympathetic to your plight even if you probably were a bit of an A H. It can be hard to read the room when you're super excited, but in general it's best to follow local custom. I'll usually research a bit about the \"crowd culture\" of a country before catching one of my favorite performers there. The differences can make it really fun to see a favorite performer in new cities/states/countries -- the vibe changes so much depending on the type of audience you're a part of. (It doesn't sound like Sweden would be top pick for me--no offence , Swedes!) If you ever get a chance to see Beyonc\u00e9 in a South American country get yourself to that show! I saw one of my favorite bands in Brazil and it was a a life altering event. The crowd was \\*\\*hyped\\*\\* --super energetic and singing along to every song, full voice, even joining in for the instrumental bits! I've seen footage of some of their shows from Mexico city and seeing them there is now on my bucket list. I saw the same band perform in Berkeley, California was it was completely different but also life altering; the crowd was giving a level of attention and quite focus that I wouldn't have thought possible in a crowd that size -- until some of the faster songs kicked off and then the frenzy was amazing! Saw them in LA and had to move around a bunch to find a spot without people conversing loudly with their friends about unrelated things or talking on their phones... location is everything :)", "NTA. You were at a concert. Come on people.", "YTA. Basic etiquette regardless of country. You buy seats, you stay seated. You don't want to stay seated, go somewhere else. \n\nThe people sitting down bought seats because they wanted to stay seated. I went to a Lord Huron show in Atlanta and got seats because my friend is disabled, as were half the people surrounding us, and some asshats stood up and danced the entire time, completely blocking our view. \n\nAccommodate yourself to what you expect you may do at a show. The excuse that it's dance music sucks. You hindered someone elses experience because you couldn't \"help it\".", "I\u2019m probably wrong but I\u2019m still going to say NTA. The idea that a bunch of people went to a Beyonc\u00e9 concert and want to treat it like it\u2019s a orchestral ballet or something is just ridiculous to me. I get the \u201cwhen in Rome\u201d thing but you\u2019re in Rome\u2026at a BEYONC\u00c9 CONCERT. \n\nBut I also had to comment because no one else seems to be acknowledging the utterly appalling racism from the woman behind you. She really had the nerve to ask a black woman \u201cIs that how they act in your village?\u201d? Are you for real? Even if we are going to say that you were unambiguously rude and unjustified in standing/dancing during the concert, none of that would excuse the woman behind you saying that. \n\n\u201cIs that how they act in your village?\u201d Worst case scenario, you inconvenienced a racist. Something I don\u2019t think is worth losing sleep over.\n\nEdit: Apparently, enough people are seeing this that the racist apologists are seeing it, too. So let\u2019s talk about the \u201cyour village\u201d comment. \n\nI\u2019ll grant that I am an American and am seeing this through an American cultural lens. In that sense, \u201cyour village\u201d is directly connecting OP to a perception of Africa as a place that is inherently less civilized than \u201cWestern\u201d nations. Which is just disgustingly reductive and colonialist. \n\nHowever, even if we concede the idea that \u201cyour village\u201d might just be synonymous with \u201cyour hometown\u201d, this is still bigoted. That\u2019s because our inconvenienced woman isn\u2019t containing her outrage to OP or her behavior. She is directly tying OP\u2019s behavior back to OP\u2019s culture of origin; one which is less civilized than her own. Even if we try and suggest that it\u2019s not \u201cbecause she\u2019s black\u201d, it is still othering in a way that comes across as bigoted. \n\nAnd, since someone asked, I would say that this same logic makes calling someone a \u201chick\u201d bigoted. If you want to insult someone without being the asshole yourself, then just insult the single individual you are mad at. The moment you start bringing that person\u2019s culture, background, upbringing, family, or whatever into the equation, you\u2019re putting yourself in dicey territory.", "I don\u2019t give a FUCK about these comments, NTA.

She was also on her feet dancing according to her stories because, uhhhh\u2026. That\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do at concerts.", "Gonna be downvoted but idc. NTA. Screw everyone else. If you're dancing and having a good time standing who cares! She's your favorite artist you should be able to enjoy it. If the people behind you were so upset they should've just stood too", "Ok. I have been to see rock concerts and dance to house music all around the US and Europe. This Beyonce tour is basically house music. If you are going to listen to house and electronic in England, in Italy in Isreal you are dancing. \n\nI think the issue is that Beyonce put out a house album and didn't accommodate for the obvious dancing that would ensue. If Everything but the Girl or Bicep or Daft Punk toured there would be space to dance. I think she set up her tour in a poor fashion for the type of music she was presenting", "Omg I can\u2019t believe how many people are saying Y T A. You\u2019re NTA!!!!!

This is why most concerts these days have split seated and standing areas. If that's not available, the general rule of thumb, no matter your location, is go with what the majority are doing. If most people are sat down, then you remain seated. Which can really suck, especially when it's something like a gig with high energy music, but that's living in a society I'm afraid. In future a good tip if you know you're gonna want to stand up and there's only seated area tickets, book the back row because then noone will care.", "As an American who loves concerts your the type of people I hate at concerts.

There's a reason why so many of them stop singing at times to watch an entire venue singing along to the songs they wrote - that fuels them to put all the energy they can into that performance. It's an amazing feeling when you can see in their body language that they are as excited to be there as you are. \n\nHonestly I've been to several concerts, both with rowdy excited crowds and apathetic ones. You can see how uncomfortable it is for the musicians when the audience is unresponsive, you can practically see them asking themselves if they should even be there onstage given the awkward atmosphere.\n\nSo as long as people are respectful, the best experiences are always the ones where the crowd is excited. But to be fair, that depends a lot on where you are and on who's in the crowd. I've been mostly to metal concerts and I've never had a problem with anyone being an A H to others before, people are pretty chill doing their own thing (probably because there's some basic etiquette at metal crowds that aren't necessarily widespread outside that community). Can't say the same for the crowds at more pop-ish acts I've seen (namely Arctic Monkeys and Imagine Dragons). I don't think I've ever seen that many rude and inconsiderate people per square meter as I did on those two concerts alone. So in my experience pop music crowds are a lot worse, but I can't compare them to a lot besides metal crowds, so maybe there's hope.", "You're a good person. Thank you for being considerate of others", "Sounds like op went to a concert that had both a standing area where people dance, and a seated area. He got a ticket to the seated area. In many countries in Europe, people who get these seats specifically get them because they want to, or have to, sit.", "Your take is precisely my opinion.\n\nIf the energy is there, the artist may give them more. They might even do something special, improvise. Sure, a standard show is nothing to scoff at, but there's just something that feels right when the artist is noticeably enjoying themselves and what they're getting from the crowd.", "And not everyone is capable of paying $1000 for the standing room area right up on the stage. \n\nYou don\u2019t have a right to an unobstructed view from dancers at a concert. That\u2019s never been the case at any concert I\u2019ve been to. Ushers do not enforce a no standing rule, and I have seen people complain and been told to fuck off.", "Where have you seen concerts, if I may ask?", "You say that while the people are actively paying to see imported American cultural expression.", "I know, right? No offense to the Swedes but that sounds like it would suck.", "Every video I see on youtube from Beyonce performing live shows in Sweden everyone is standing up. \n\nIs it really true that even at rock concerts most people there will stay seated the whole time? Like when artists are on stage trying to get the audience to participate, they just sit there?", "This comment chain really shows what a bunch of miserable shut ins the average reddit user is. European social convenyions aside, we're talking about US...what kind of loser gets angry at people for having fun and enjoying themselves at a *concert*.

The parent was oblivious or just thought their kid was darling. Nope.", "Ooooh I finally got to see Depeche Mode when I was 22. 5th row at the Rose Garden for the Exciter tour. Best show of my life. Totally worth losing my voice for an entire month. \n\nThe whole crowd probably lost their voices for a month.", "Yeah every concert I've been to everyone stood. Although I've only been to concerts in the US and Norway.", "Depends on the theater. Some of those Broadway theaters you\u2019d fall off the balcony too easy!\n\nI can\u2019t wait to see \u201cHere Lies Love\u201d because they\u2019re turning the theater into a dance floor!", "NTA these replies are KILLING me. I kind of get what people are saying about enjoying in a different way but damn, concerts are so much about being around others people who love and appreciate the music as much as you do. And part of that is GETTING INTO IT, dancing, singing, being free/loose! I can sit at home and watch a video of my fav artist performing live if I want to sit on my ass and just listen. I pay for concerts because I want a whole experience and vibe. Many of us feel and express via movement. Idk why this has turned into bashing Americans. We have many faults but no one can say we don\u2019t put our heart and soul into certain activities", "NTA bruh and they say Germans are the ones that are no fun...", "NTA. I saw Beyonc\u00e9 in Edinburgh a week ago and she feeds off the crowd\u2019s energy a lot and even commented on how good of a crowd we were for being so lively and supportive. I\u2019ve seen clips of her shows in Sweden and it\u2019s honestly depressing. Bey is so bubbly and friendly and every time she tried to interact with the crowd they gave her nothing, which can only be discouraging. You paid for your ticket, and you can damn well show your love the way you know and the way she\u2019ll appreciate.", "I\u2019m kinda grossed out by the locals in this circumstance. They also paid to have a good time and they just sit there like they\u2019re at an old opera or something? The whole point of a concert is the fun and the energy of the crowd. It\u2019s certainly not fun for the artist to have a boring crowd either. \n\nYou paid for an experience, and they seem to have paid for something they could do literally any given day with any device that simply plays music or runs YouTube. \n\nFuck \u2018em.

Everyone quietly sitting for what is essentially a house music concert, to the point where the performer comments on it?? Embarrassing.", "Swede here. You're assuming one hell of a lot about my country and culture, and you are wrong. I've been going to concerts for 30 years, and dancing and singing at concerts is normal.

So floor tickets, standing tickets, or pit tickets (the name differs depending on location and type of artist). The benefit is that people with nom-seat tickets are expected to stand so dancing / being more expressive is the norm with those tickets. They're a good way to be able to rock out without upsetting the people around you.", "Yup I lol'd", "not a beyonc\u00e9 fan, but as a brazilian and as someone that adores concerts in general the idea of having to be quietly sitting at a concert that is hype is entirely bizarre and weird to me", "Right? I saw the videos from that show. She was getting frustrated because the crowd was giving her NOTHING!", " Even Beyonc\u00e9 found the Swede crowd to be boring lol", "What I got from this thread is that Europeans are extremely stiff and boring and reddit is full of miserable shut ins who hate to see people having fun.

The person that comes to my mind is Big Sean, I've seen him a couple times and he REALLY gets into the crowds energy, it's a little corny but it makes it pretty fun.", "I agree. You follow the customs norms when you travel! You don\u2019t try and enforce yours on them. I\u2019d also be terrified of looking stupid if I was the only one dancing.", "OP is literally black.

When I'm at a show I want to feel the energy of the performer. That's not something you can experience in the same way on a screen at home.\n\nWhen the venue offers a place for people to dance without disrupting anyone else's experience, why is that not enough?

So of course me being in the back row, sitting in my wheelchair and being short made it so I basically watched everyone\u2019s ass the entire concert instead of the singer. The ushers did nothing. So yes, YTA.\n\nEditing to add: The fact that they sell these seats as accesible but you can\u2019t see anything from a wheelchair is sort of on the venue/ushers too.

Luckily, not very loudly, just singing to herself really,  but it was still a little distracting. During intermission, she told me this was like her fourth or seventh time seeing Hamilton on stage. So it's not like she was unaware that this wasn't a sing-along. Luckily, nobody at the show was rude enough to think singing along loudly was OK. I'd gone to this theater for a field trip when I was in elementary school where we were taught theater etiquette, but I don't think that's something a lot of ppl are taught.
