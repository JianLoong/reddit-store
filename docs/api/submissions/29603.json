It means a lot to me to go and be there as a way of saying goodbye but also to be there for the rest of my family who also lost a daughter, sister, aunt, cousin etc. My grandma said she would pay for my plane ticket as well as a hotel room with her. the only thing my dad would have to do is allow me to go and drive me to the airport/ terminal. \n\nBefore i could finish he shot me down and said no i am not allowed to go bc i can count on one hand how many times i\u2019ve seen herl.. i texted him while i was at work saying this:\n\n\u201ci am so incredibly and unimaginable furious at you right now dad. i asked to go to my aunt jamie\u2019s funeral to not only act as a way to say goodbye but also be there for everyone who lost a daughter, sister, and aunt. i would miss 6 hours of school, grandma would pay for everything because they want me there. respectfully how dare you use the excuse of me counting on one hand how many times i saw her when you and mom both are the reason i haven\u2019t been able to visit them in years. i\u2019m so upset i need a few days to calm down honestly\u201d\nhis response: \n\n\u201cOk\u201d\n\u201cYou know now I\u2019m incredibly upset. Not every person can go to a funeral especially when it\u2019s in a different state. Am I going to let you be at Detroit metro airport by yourself absolutely not. Shame on you for getting pissed at your dad for saying the word no. You need to grow up and understand you\u2019re not going to get your way all the time. You can\u2019t even do your laundry so do I think you would leave your wallet or phone on a chair in the airport yes I do.\u201d\n\nI am seriously considering moving out when i turn 18 because i don\u2019t personally think i could ever forgive him for this and for the reasons he gave me. he also told me i need to grow up and know i won\u2019t always get what i want. this is infuriating because it\u2019s not like i asked to go to the mall and he said no and i threw a tantrum, i asked to say my final goodbyes to my aunt and he said i\u2019m not allowed to go. When there is absolutely nothing stopping me; i physically am able to go.\n\nwhere i might be the asshole is thinking about moving out and not letting this whole situation go, i do understand i\u2019m grieving so i very well could be blowing this out of proportion, moving out is a big thing to bring up, also i do understand traveling \u201calone\u201d.

I may not have seen her frequently, but the memories I have with her mean a lot to me. The falling out between Mom and her family was a painful situation for all of us, and I don't want to let that define my relationship with my extended family forever. Grandma wants me there, and she's willing to help with the logistics.*\r  \n\r  \n*I understand that you worry about my ability to handle things on my own, like laundry, but I'm willing to take responsibility for myself in this situation. I'll make sure to stay in touch and keep you updated throughout the trip. It's not about getting my way all the time; it's about saying goodbye and supporting my family during this difficult time. Please reconsider, and let me be there for them.\"*  \n\n\nI don't blame you for wanting to move out. (P.S. I also struggle with Laundry)  \nThe question is, can you channel this anger into calculated action and proactive steps WITHOUT letting your dad find out so that you can move out when you turn 18?", "OK, first, a funeral is a big deal and your grandma is taking care of almost all of the logistics. Your dad is dismissing your feelings (you can miss someone you haven't seen in years!) and I don't believe for a minute that he said no because you might leave your wallet behind.\n\nIf your dad were actually concerned about you travelling alone, he could find ways to help you. Walk into the terminal with you, text you every so often to remind you to locate your stuff, give you a credit card for emergencies, etc. \n\nI can't tell what his issue is - maybe he wants to keep you away from that side of the family, maybe he's not ready to let you grow up - but he's sure as hell not thinking about your needs here.\n\nBut I'm not sure you'll get anywhere with the moving out talk. Whether you bring it up now or not, you have a right to move out the day your turn 18 and your dad knows that. \n\nI think this is what you need to say to him: \n\n> i don\u2019t personally think i could ever forgive him for this\n\nNo guarantee that he'll be able to let go of whatever it is, but sharing this level of feeling \\*without any specific threat attached\\* is the most likely to get through to him.\n\nGood luck!
