She doesn\u2019t say anything outright, but her actions are almost bizarre they\u2019re so petty. I sincerely would say if I thought I had done something to warrant this, but she\u2019s been pretty cold to me since day 1. The first day I met her she referred to me as \u201ctemporary.\u201d Still, she was invited to our wedding, I always make an effort to be cordial, and I don\u2019t have the energy to care beyond that. \n\nHer excluding me from things has always been a pattern. For example my husband\u2019s Christmas present last year was a gift certificate for rock climbing. She had already picked a date and friends to go with. I didn\u2019t make the cut. She also always buys him things when she travels and makes sure to address them only to him when she sends them. I could go on, but I think y\u2019all will get it. She\u2019s not horrible, but noticeably rude. \n\nBtw, she absolutely has a crush on my husband. I know this. He would never cheat so I don\u2019t care. \n\nThings came to a head last week when he explained she was having a birthday dinner with just close friends. I wasn\u2019t invited- she made that clear. It later came out that the intimate dinner she pitched has turned to a house party with over 50 people invited. The Facebook invite says it\u2019s an \u201copen invite.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had it. I told my husband I don\u2019t think he should go. It\u2019s gotten to the point that this is openly disrespectful.  \n\nTo his credit, my husband agreed with me, but he\u2019s very, very sad because they\u2019ve been friends since childhood and he \u201cknows this will ruin it.\u201d I told him I don\u2019t have a ton of sympathy because if this is enough to ruin their friendship, it\u2019s not one worth having. \n\nHe asked if he could take her out for drinks just the two of them to celebrate, but I wasn\u2019t thrilled. I said he was a grown man and could do what he wanted, but I feel it\u2019s pretty fucked up. \n\nFinally, he asked if we could sit down to talk with her and \u201call take accountability.\u201d I said sure but I don\u2019t see what good it will do. I also said I wouldn\u2019t apologize unless she could point to something specific that I\u2019ve done to warrant it. I\u2019ve been nothing but nice to a person who has been repeatedly disrespectful. \n\nMaybe I could have handled it better. Maybe the repeated pattern is making me a little harsh in the situation. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: FYI my husband is a wonderful person who has always said he\u2019d pick me over her (and probably his childhood friend group) every time. I never pushed this because I don\u2019t care very much. I have absolutely no doubt he\u2019ll do the \u201cright thing\u201d if I ask. I just want to make sure what I\u2019m asking is the right thing.\n\nEdit to my edit: My husband is reading these responses and it\u2019s been helpful! I can see it so clearly on the outside but he\u2019s been sucked into crazy town for so long it\u2019s good for him to see how juvenile she\u2019s being.

He can just say \u201chey, it\u2019s not cool that my wife isn\u2019t invited and honestly it\u2019s making me more and more uncomfortable how you have been treating her.

His friend is disrespecting you.  His friend has referred to you as temporary.  His friend does not view you as husband's partner.  His friend does not include you in partner events.\n\nTOTALLY unacceptable for a married person to allow their partner to be treated so disrespectfully.  When your husband married you, he made a commitment to stand by you.  Instead, he is letting his friend crap all over you, because... why?  He doesn't want to lose his friend?  The person who craps on his wife?  As a general rule, my husband does not like people who crap on me.  Why does yours??\n\nHonestly, you have handled this FAR too gently for my liking.  What does he mean by \"all take accountability\"?  I would have demanded a very specific explanation for that.  What does HE think YOU have done?  What does HE think HE has done?  What is this accountability you are taking?  And why is he taking accountability to her, and not to you, his wife, for putting you in this position for YEARS?", "NTA\n\nSome of these are way more offensive than others, but your husband should have long-since removed himself from this \u201cfriendship.\u201d", "NTA.

She openly has a crush on him, she deliberately excludes you from invitations, and has made her dislike of you obvious. But why hasn\u2019t your husband put his foot down before this? He should have made it clear to her as soon as her attitude was apparent that he would not put up with her disrespecting you. \n\nI would confront him about why he has tolerated her behavior all this time. Tell your husband that there is no reason for the 3 of you to sit down and \u201call take accountability\u201d, because you have done nothing wrong.  She is trying to triangulate the situation, making it into a 2-against-1 dynamic, and if the 3 of you sit down together, she *will* try to pressure him to take her side and make you out to be the problem. \n\nIn reality, her bad behavior is an issue between the two of them as friends. He should not be ok with any supposed friend of his treating his partner badly. She is completely disrespecting his choice to be with you, and manufacturing drama by insisting on being adversarial towards you.

I don\u2019t like it and I\u2019m not going to participate in anything when she\u2019s excluded anymore.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to discuss it with her or provide any rebuttals to her explanations.", "NTA. I would ask your husband what he means by \"all take accountability\". It sounds like he is excusing her behaviour by suggesting you have some responsibility for it. That is concerning.

There is no room for \u2018friends\u2019 like that in a marriage. I cannot even imagine being so petty to not invite the wife of a friend. But in all fairness your husband has been pretty crappy being ok with her acting this way to you. \nNTA", "And your \u201chusband\u201d is ok with that?  Jeez he doesn\u2019t like or respect you.\n\nYou should not have to ask your husband to pick you over anyone.  It should be a given.\n\nWhich is not the case here.  I\u2019m sorry.", "The simple solution to that is he stop going to things where she has excluded you. Which is what he should have done ages ago.   If the rest of the group is behaving this way, then he should not want to be in the group.  If they are not, then it should be easy to attend the social events that you *are* invited to.\n\nIf they are part of a \"group\" of friends, then he can distance his friendship from her while maintaining the other friendships.  It's literally as simple as reaching out more to others, and less (i.e. none) to her.  You are growing up, that happens naturally as people have jobs and families and time is tighter.\n\nIf his concern is that she will turn on him and get him blacklisted, then he should seriously dislike a person who he thinks might do something like that.  And when talking about her to you, he should be referring to her as the witch.  The fact that he still considers her a *friend* means that this is not just about him worrying about losing his group.  He is worried about losing HER.", "Nope, sorry.\n\nMy brother has a circle of friends that have been together... Uh.... Let's go with 30+ years at this point . Since grade school. The core six guys are... they're drop everything, come running, closer than most blood. Hell, when my first nibbling arrived three+ months early, I had to call each one and say 'please don't get on a plane yet, they're not ready' because within 20 minutes of finding out nibbling was here, they had all independently booked next day international flights to go to my brother just to be there to support him and my SiL. \n\nThey haven't always loved every significant other. In a couple of cases, they actively disliked them. But they were never less than polite - and once the relationship was serious, that person was part of the group. Period. No ifs, ands or buts. \n\nOk, when the hell husband (HH) finally got kicked to the curb, they might have thrown a 'thank g-d you're single again' party... But, you know, after a three year 'couldn't keep his pants zipped' marriage that saw him take J for six figures and got J beat up by a disgruntled lover, I think that was justified. \n\nMy point is, a good friend group accepts that even if they don't love someone, when a member of the group has picked them, the group expands. Not for everything - I can tell you HH never got invited to Saturday morning market breakfasts, not that he would have gone anyways - but a party for 50? Come on.\n\nI know it's hard, but your husband's got to see that this isn't ok... No matter how long they've been friends.", "It absolutely does suck. Just remember that it is her messing up the group dynamic, not you. You have been far more tolerant than I would be in your position, and it makes sense that you are finally fed up. \n\nI\u2019m glad your husband is in agreement with you, but I think he owes you an apology for allowing her nonsense to go on for so long without putting her in check for it. He never should have been okay with any friend of his showing such flagrant disrespect towards you. That\u2019s just not cool.", "How do you feel about the fact that he never cared enough to put a stop to it? \n\nIt isn\u2019t just her disrespecting you. She initiates it and your husband and and the rest follow her along. \n\nShe\u2019s awful for sure but her rudeness sounds pretty blatant the way you describe it so surely after all this time, others must\u2019ve picked up on it. You know your husband at least has. So why do they all still allow her to determine who\u2019s in and who\u2019s out of activities and get togethers? \n\nI think there\u2019s plenty of blame to go around here.", "Everyone else has already said my thoughts better, but I have to ask: How has this never come up in therapy? And if it HAS come up, why does Reddit need to show him the way?", "It sounds like he wants to make you the bad guy instead of him standing up to his friend and going \"you can't disrespect my wife like this and expect me to stick around.\"", "I understand you not caring. You trust your husband and you sound like you just consider her an annoyance. I don\u2019t understand him not caring. I can\u2019t imagine letting such rude, disrespectful behavior toward my husband to go on for this long.", "I think you are giving your husband too much understanding!  I think you and him both could benefit from counseling.\n\nI worry you are letting them walk all over you which isn\u2019t right.", "I wish that you would take a step back while you\u2019re passionately defending your husband & ask yourself why he has never stood up for you. She\u2019s attacked your character and your marriage & he has participated by allowing it. \n\nAdmitting that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s a horrible, irredeemable person. No one\u2019s saying you should divorce him over this. But there will be no meaningful resolution or change if the two of you can\u2019t accept just how bad & harmful to your marriage his choices have been. The goal is to overcome this & have a stronger marriage, right? Denial & excuses isn\u2019t the way to achieve that.", "Oh no. He has to cut that off lol. Let her have one last hissy fit about him standing up for you, or him cutting her off, and just leave it at that. If she's talking shit all the time, just cut off her supply lol. She will eventually move on, or reach a point where it's just too repetitive for anyone to care.", "This is why he has to phrase it as HIM not wanting to participate without you. \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t make it. I\u2019m spending that day with my wife.\u201d \n\nThen, knowing how she can twist it, the conversation should be over. He doesn\u2019t need to discuss it any further with her.", "Honestly it's probably getting worse because your husband hasn't squashed this shit yet. Shes getting desperate because she's been playing this game with the two of you for years, she thinks she has a chance and she's leveling up by so openly excluding you from a large party. She wants to see what she can continue to get away with when it comes to him and how much he'll allow it. \n\nThis isn't someone that you work something out with, this is someone that has malicious intent and has to be cut off completely for good.", "This also allows his other friends to think op is standing in the friends and husbands way. That\u2019s probably why they are hostile and pushes him to spend time with her.\n\n\nWhat your husband is doing is disrespectful no wonder his friends have no problems disrespecting you. They think it\u2019s ok since he does it. He must not care.", "I just read this comment to him and he had a \u201cOh shit, true\u201d moment.", "Exactly! Would OP\u2019s husband like being iced out by a villain friend of hers?\n\nLetmethinkaboutthat-NOOOOOO", "TBH, he\u2019s not but she\u2019s honestly just so fucking dramatic. I\u2019m very type B and don\u2019t care enough for conflict. We both knew this was coming to a head for a while, but I think I\u2019ve been avoiding it.", "I just said your second sentence to him and it helped. My motto in life is \u201cIf you don\u2019t like Meg that\u2019s your problem. Not my problem.\u201d \n\nI think he\u2019s learning to adopt that.", "This!!", "Again your husband cares more about her than you.  Maybe you need to think about why you\u2019re good with being second, third, fourth, fifth to all his friends.", "Mmm I can understand this. He needs to create more space, or she needs to put you first in some degree. You're in, or she's out tbh. \n\nI usually wouldn't suggest this but y'all are all old enough to be able to understand respect. You have been too kind, and I totally understand that. He is also being too kind... To her. She is an adult, he doesn't need to coddle her, he needs to grow a spine and stand up for you.", "Honestly.... I have seen this a lot when the husband is talking shit about the gf/wife to the friend or friends, so then they don't like her and don't share much conversations with her and play dumb when gf/wife \"says your friend doesn't like me\", he might not want you in your friend circle? Or he might even be having some kind of affair with her? We all like to think our partners never cheat but you never know. One out of the 3 in this group is super toxic and has to go, cause this behavior is not normal.", "He's \"always said\" he'd pick you? This is a reoccurring issue but he won't pull the trigger unless you tell him to? So that he has ammo to use down the line that you made him cut off his friends? So that she can \"accurately\" start telling people that you made him cut off his friends? Coward. NTA", "Clearly you see her as a conniving interloper that's after your man, but I wonder how true that is. I've seen this scenario play out in 2 different ways... the \"friend\" that really did have it out for the woman he married and just the opposite, the wife that is so bothered by the fact that another woman had the audacity to be close to HER man that she was certain it was all a ploy to steal him.\n\nMy vote is ESH because it's next to impossible to know which end this falls on, but if you trust him then I guess I don't see the need to fully expel her from his life.", "ESH. Why must your husband and you attend the same friend group functions . Can we normalize having and maintaining relationships that are platonic away from our spouse. If she doesn\u2019t care for you , of course it\u2019s going to be awkward if you attend anything involved with friend group .  You have some cross over friend functions and some that don\u2019t . Why isn\u2019t this more normalized. She doesn\u2019t need to send gifts for both of you, that\u2019s weird to expect. Childhood friends were there before spouses and there thru divorces. \n\nNow because of the crush thing that\u2019s what makes her , the ah . If she knowingly has feelings deeper than the friendship and is doing extra stuff to win him over then that\u2019s not ok. I would like to know how you \u201c know\u201d and how she interacts with other men in the friendship group . Is she just generous with all.\n\nYour husband for not having a strong position on the matter . If he felt she was out of order then as being her friend he should also be comfortable enough to  have addressed this conversation with her privately. I wonder if he is a turn coat kinda person when he with friends that\u2019s why don\u2019t want you around because he sides with them when you are not.", "Yeah, you\u2019re the AH.\n\n- let him go to the party without emotionally blackmailing him if he wants to go\n- he should afterwords have a conversation with her and say something along the lines of \u201chey, it\u2019s hurtful to (wife) that you seem to be really cold towards her. I care about our friendship, but if you\u2019re not more accepting of her it\u2019ll eventually probably get in the way of us being friends, if I\u2019m just being realistic and honest. Maybe we can get together sometime soon to talk about things and try to find warmer, common ground?\u201d\n- meet, with an open mind, and try to ditch the childish attitude of feeling entitled to be at someone\u2019s birthday party and feeling like you should be able to forbid your husband from spending time with a friend who hasn\u2019t done anything bad to you, just probably doesn\u2019t like you", "NTA. Serious boundary crossing here. That chick is disrespectful to you. Time for hubby to cut her out.", "NTA but your husband is for continuing to be \"friends\" with her. Good luck", "NTA and from the edits and comments it sounds like he is waking up. As long as he is very firm that his wife will always come first, with no exceptions, then don't be too hard on hubby.  Took him longer than it should have but the journey can't be easy with old friends. Once he points out every single time y'all are a package deal from here on out he still gets lots of credit and accolades. So yay for Hubby!
