She doesn\u2019t say anything outright, but her actions are almost bizarre they\u2019re so petty. I sincerely would say if I thought I had done something to warrant this, but she\u2019s been pretty cold to me since day 1. The first day I met her she referred to me as \u201ctemporary.\u201d Still, she was invited to our wedding, I always make an effort to be cordial, and I don\u2019t have the energy to care beyond that. \n\nHer excluding me from things has always been a pattern. For example my husband\u2019s Christmas present last year was a gift certificate for rock climbing. She had already picked a date and friends to go with. I didn\u2019t make the cut. She also always buys him things when she travels and makes sure to address them only to him when she sends them. I could go on, but I think y\u2019all will get it. She\u2019s not horrible, but noticeably rude. \n\nBtw, she absolutely has a crush on my husband. I know this. He would never cheat so I don\u2019t care. \n\nThings came to a head last week when he explained she was having a birthday dinner with just close friends. I wasn\u2019t invited- she made that clear. It later came out that the intimate dinner she pitched has turned to a house party with over 50 people invited. The Facebook invite says it\u2019s an \u201copen invite.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve had it. I told my husband I don\u2019t think he should go. It\u2019s gotten to the point that this is openly disrespectful.  \n\nTo his credit, my husband agreed with me, but he\u2019s very, very sad because they\u2019ve been friends since childhood and he \u201cknows this will ruin it.\u201d I told him I don\u2019t have a ton of sympathy because if this is enough to ruin their friendship, it\u2019s not one worth having. \n\nHe asked if he could take her out for drinks just the two of them to celebrate, but I wasn\u2019t thrilled. I said he was a grown man and could do what he wanted, but I feel it\u2019s pretty fucked up. \n\nFinally, he asked if we could sit down to talk with her and \u201call take accountability.\u201d I said sure but I don\u2019t see what good it will do. I also said I wouldn\u2019t apologize unless she could point to something specific that I\u2019ve done to warrant it. I\u2019ve been nothing but nice to a person who has been repeatedly disrespectful. \n\nMaybe I could have handled it better. Maybe the repeated pattern is making me a little harsh in the situation. \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: FYI my husband is a wonderful person who has always said he\u2019d pick me over her (and probably his childhood friend group) every time. I never pushed this because I don\u2019t care very much. I have absolutely no doubt he\u2019ll do the \u201cright thing\u201d if I ask. I just want to make sure what I\u2019m asking is the right thing.\n\nEdit to my edit: My husband is reading these responses and it\u2019s been helpful! I can see it so clearly on the outside but he\u2019s been sucked into crazy town for so long it\u2019s good for him to see how juvenile she\u2019s being.

He can just say \u201chey, it\u2019s not cool that my wife isn\u2019t invited and honestly it\u2019s making me more and more uncomfortable how you have been treating her.

His friend is disrespecting you.  His friend has referred to you as temporary.  His friend does not view you as husband's partner.  His friend does not include you in partner events.\n\nTOTALLY unacceptable for a married person to allow their partner to be treated so disrespectfully.  When your husband married you, he made a commitment to stand by you.  Instead, he is letting his friend crap all over you, because... why?  He doesn't want to lose his friend?  The person who craps on his wife?  As a general rule, my husband does not like people who crap on me.  Why does yours??\n\nHonestly, you have handled this FAR too gently for my liking.  What does he mean by \"all take accountability\"?  I would have demanded a very specific explanation for that.  What does HE think YOU have done?  What does HE think HE has done?  What is this accountability you are taking?  And why is he taking accountability to her, and not to you, his wife, for putting you in this position for YEARS?", "NTA\n\nSome of these are way more offensive than others, but your husband should have long-since removed himself from this \u201cfriendship.\u201d", "NTA.

She openly has a crush on him, she deliberately excludes you from invitations, and has made her dislike of you obvious. But why hasn\u2019t your husband put his foot down before this? He should have made it clear to her as soon as her attitude was apparent that he would not put up with her disrespecting you. \n\nI would confront him about why he has tolerated her behavior all this time. Tell your husband that there is no reason for the 3 of you to sit down and \u201call take accountability\u201d, because you have done nothing wrong.  She is trying to triangulate the situation, making it into a 2-against-1 dynamic, and if the 3 of you sit down together, she *will* try to pressure him to take her side and make you out to be the problem. \n\nIn reality, her bad behavior is an issue between the two of them as friends. He should not be ok with any supposed friend of his treating his partner badly. She is completely disrespecting his choice to be with you, and manufacturing drama by insisting on being adversarial towards you.

I don\u2019t like it and I\u2019m not going to participate in anything when she\u2019s excluded anymore.\u201d He doesn\u2019t need to discuss it with her or provide any rebuttals to her explanations.", "NTA. I would ask your husband what he means by \"all take accountability\". It sounds like he is excusing her behaviour by suggesting you have some responsibility for it. That is concerning.

One who clearly has a thing for you and is actively trying to come between the two of you? \n\nIt would be one thing if you have a friend who just did not get along with your wife, cause they have different personalities, but they were still respectful. But this is not the case here. This friend of yours wants to break up your marriage, and while you are not going along with it, you are not putting a stop to it. \n\nIs that the kind of person you want to be friends with?\n\nYour wife is NTA for asking your not to go, but you have been the AH for allowing a \"friend\" to disrespect her for years.", "NTA he needs to tell his 'friend' your his wife and to get used to it this childishness of excluding you stops now or the friendship stop be civil to my wife or dont bother woth me at all would be my answer in his place.", "Wonderful husband\u2019s don\u2019t sit silently on the ass for years while everyone they call a friend disrespects and dismisses their wife.

You should not have to tell him not to go, he should have made that decision himself based on how his friends treat someone he supposedly loves.  He not only condones their behavior but is openly stating he wants to take a woman who he knows has feelings for him on a one on one date.  Your husband hasn't given her many reasons to not think she has a chance.  She disrespects you, your husband chooses her while telling you he would choose you, and she gets alone time with him to try to convince him to leave you and be with her.  That's a win for her.", ">he asked if we could sit down to talk with her and \u201call take accountability.\u201d\n\nWTF do YOU have to take accountability for?

Because she gets away with it every single time! Because your husband didn't stand up to her when she attacked you. Your husband should have shot this shit down the first time but he didn't. So she interpreted your husband's passiveness as silent agreement, as taking her side against your side, picking her and her feelings over you and your feelings. And because she got away with it, she keeps pushing the limits further constantly to push you out of the picture more and more and eventually get him to pick her over you for relationship. She thinks she has a chance with him. Your husband never made it clear that she doesn't have a chance. With these \"digs\" at you she also tests how much your husband allows her to mistreat you, to what extent he allows her to mistreat you, how much more she has to push him to get rid of you.

I can understand how initially he didn\u2019t want to cause a rift among his friends (as someone who who dislikes confrontation) but I would never allow someone to disrespect my partner- that\u2019s a direct insult to myself.

If he had set clear, appropriate, healthy boundaries with that woman and enforced them from the start then OP wouldn't have to deal with a husband's friend problem now (and the past x years). It\u2019s long overdue for OP's husband to wake up!"]}
