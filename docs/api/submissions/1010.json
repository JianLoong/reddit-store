She is an amazing mom and partner. She cannot cook to save her life. \n\nI'm not sure why but she seems to have no sense of taste or smell.  So she doesn't care what food tastes like. She also doesn't care how it feels in your mouth.  She will boil a roast until it is cooked through then make up a $2 package of gravy to go with it.  With boiled potatoes and store bought salad.  \n\nI know she is busy with work and the kids so when I am on between jobs I take over the cooking.  I make everything from scratch. I have the time.  So for example instead of microwave pizza I will make pizza in our wood fired pizza oven. Or I will make stuff like pulled pork poutine. That is french fries with cheese curds covered in pulled pork and gravy.  The pulled pork shoulder takes about eight hours to do up.  \n\nThat's what I was making today. I do meal preps for the kids and her when I have time. So I made a really big pork shoulder in the slow cooker with a stout, chicken stock, and apple cider vinegar as liquid to reduce for gravy afterwards. \n\nI took the dogs for a walk while I was waiting for the shoulder to rest so I couldn't of shred it and set aside 2/3 of it for wraps or other lunches.  \n\nShe came home early. And decided to pitch in. She microwaved come fries and just shredded the entire shoulder. She then put the fries on a tray put a few cheese curds on and then dumped the pork and liquid on.  The fries were soggy from it.  \n\nThe kids and I ate it and I thanked her for helping.  And then I asked her for like the hundredth time to please stop helping me cook meals.  \n\nShe called me ungrateful. And said that the food was fine and that she wanted to eat right away.  It would have taken me an hour or so to make up the fries and reduce the liquid to a nice gravy.  \n\nI know she gets jealous when the kids eat my roasted potatoes with mixed roast veggies with gusto but leave half her boiled vegetables on their plates.  I have offered to teach her how to cook better. I have left detailed recipes for her to make simple meals for the kids.  No go, she just can't understand that food is more than just fuel. \n\nI am getting really upset now. It is like she is sabotaging my meals on purpose now. But she thinks me and the kids are just picky babies.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEdit \n\nYes I know I screwed up when I was trying to make the story less recognizable if my partner saw it.", "created_utc": 1667452662, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ykt3ao/aita_got_telling_my_wife_to_stop_helping_me_cook/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't cook but also I'm similar to your wife. As long as someone else cooks it I will gladly eat whatever you put on my plate and even volunteer for fishes after. That being said, sometimes I'm just hungry and want to eat. If every meal is spectacle of your love for food, I would probably interfere to get it done already as well. If she was hungry and you argued that you just needed another hour to reduce gravy then I don't blame her for opting for microwave fries. No one is wrong here y'all just need to realize that everyone is idiosyncratic when it comes to food and try to navigate that together. Nah", "In my own relationship I\u2019m your wife lol I\u2019m not the best cook but my bf is a literal chef. He usually takes over the cooking and shows me a few things as he goes too. However, when I do cook even if it\u2019s kinda like how your wife cooks, he\u2019ll still eat it and appreciate it even if I can tell he\u2019s not a huge fan of it all the time. I think that\u2019s where you\u2019re being the slight AH here. She\u2019s trying in her way and you gotta give her that. I think you guys just need to communicate. It sounds like you\u2019re not communicating what your plans are for the food until after she does something you get mad about.
