However, because her mother has never liked me and treated me poorly for 20 years, we've never had a close relationship. There was a period when I moved back to my hometown in 2019 because I was pregnant, that we bonded a little bit. I would babysit my niece and nephew for her when she asked, they would sometimes come visit me and my son after he was born. I left my hometown in early 2020 just before covid hit and returned to the province I was in before. \n\nSo herein lies the problem. My sister stopped talking to me and stopped letting me talk to my niece and nephew just over a year ago. The reasons for this was because the abuse from her mother towards me finally came to a head and I argued with both my father and her mother about it. My step mother does not speak to me now. She doesn't allow my 3 youngest siblings that live with her to speak to me. And my sister won't allow herself or my niece and nephew to speak to me either. I've tried reaching out to my sister several times to check on the kids. I miss them dearly. \nWell yesterday I finally heard from my sister. But she's is asking for money. Apparently she is in a bad situation and needs to get some money together to help herself out of it. My niece and nephew live with their father now. I declined to help her. I told her I wouldn't have thought twice if she had let me speak to my niece and nephew over the last more than a year. \nI barely know her now and I don't know those kids. The kids are not in danger but i still feel guilty that I said no to helping her. \n\nMy dad says family is family and she will always come around but I've been trying to set boundaries and not let people use me. \nAITA for not helping her?", "created_utc": 1675084603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p1qc5/aita_for_not_helping_my_step_sister/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
