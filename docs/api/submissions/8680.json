However, because her mother has never liked me and treated me poorly for 20 years, we've never had a close relationship.

I would babysit my niece and nephew for her when she asked, they would sometimes come visit me and my son after he was born. I left my hometown in early 2020 just before covid hit and returned to the province I was in before. \n\nSo herein lies the problem. My sister stopped talking to me and stopped letting me talk to my niece and nephew just over a year ago. The reasons for this was because the abuse from her mother towards me finally came to a head and I argued with both my father and her mother about it. My step mother does not speak to me now. She doesn't allow my 3 youngest siblings that live with her to speak to me. And my sister won't allow herself or my niece and nephew to speak to me either. I've tried reaching out to my sister several times to check on the kids. I miss them dearly. \nWell yesterday I finally heard from my sister. But she's is asking for money.

I told her I wouldn't have thought twice if she had let me speak to my niece and nephew over the last more than a year. \nI barely know her now and I don't know those kids.
