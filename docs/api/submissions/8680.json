However, because her mother has never liked me and treated me poorly for 20 years, we've never had a close relationship. There was a period when I moved back to my hometown in 2019 because I was pregnant, that we bonded a little bit. I would babysit my niece and nephew for her when she asked, they would sometimes come visit me and my son after he was born. I left my hometown in early 2020 just before covid hit and returned to the province I was in before. \n\nSo herein lies the problem. My sister stopped talking to me and stopped letting me talk to my niece and nephew just over a year ago. The reasons for this was because the abuse from her mother towards me finally came to a head and I argued with both my father and her mother about it. My step mother does not speak to me now. She doesn't allow my 3 youngest siblings that live with her to speak to me. And my sister won't allow herself or my niece and nephew to speak to me either. I've tried reaching out to my sister several times to check on the kids. I miss them dearly. \nWell yesterday I finally heard from my sister. But she's is asking for money. Apparently she is in a bad situation and needs to get some money together to help herself out of it. My niece and nephew live with their father now. I declined to help her. I told her I wouldn't have thought twice if she had let me speak to my niece and nephew over the last more than a year. \nI barely know her now and I don't know those kids. The kids are not in danger but i still feel guilty that I said no to helping her. \n\nMy dad says family is family and she will always come around but I've been trying to set boundaries and not let people use me. \nAITA for not helping her?", "created_utc": 1675084603, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10p1qc5/aita_for_not_helping_my_step_sister/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your father and stepmother can help out your stepsister - y'know cos she's family...", "NTA If family is family, WTH is it ok to ghost you? Why can\u2019t this sister get help from her mother and your dad? You can\u2019t speak to your younger siblings,niece and nephew, and sister, an adult woman, sides with her mother against you? Now she needs something and comes to you? No.", "NTA!\n\nGood for you for setting boundaries and standards. She can't expect to walk out of your life, wanting nothing to do with you or your son, without so much as a peep from her, and then expect to just pop up like a year later because she needs something and she's desperate. You deserve better than that!!!!!!   \n\n\nWhy can't she ask her mom? Or her ex? Or some friends she has closer to home? There are plenty of other options she could try. (and perhaps she did try and you're her last resort for help, which makes her actions even worse!)....But given the circumstances, this is far beyond unacceptable on her part. What a dick move! \n\nThere is nothing wrong with you acknowledging that and saying \"no\".

Your father and stepmother can help her since they helped poison her against you.", "NTA. You said exactly what you should have.", "NTA. Your dad can give her the money. Where the Hell was he when his wife and kids were abusing and ignoring you? You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA. She has no right to cut you off and then come out of the wood works a year later only to ask you for money.", "NTA - wait your dad (whose wife and children don't talk to you) he says you should help her?  What is step mother doing to help her daughter?\n\nYou have children of your own and no family to support you.  Take care of yourself.", "NTA.  Why is the mother that poisoned her against you not helping her?  She chose sides long ago and in remaining removed from the situation, you are only protecting yourself (and your child) from being emotionally hurt further.", "NTA \"family is family\" seems to only get thrown out when people who don't act like family  want something.", "NTA people always \"need\" you when it is convent for them...", "NTA. Would she be talking to you at all if she didn't think she could get some money out of you? Pretty obviously not. She's trying to use you, you don't need someone like that in your life.\n\nAs to your father? He's the bigger AH here (maybe less than your stepmother, hard to say). \"Family is family\"? Funny how that doesn't seem to apply when you want to simply talk to your siblings/step siblings, but always applies when you have something they want, isn't it?\n\nIf you give them money, they will pretend to be nice until they get it. Then you'll be right back to being the outcast until they want something else.", "NTA, and as it has nothing to do with your niece and nephew and your money won't be helping them, I totally agree with you not giving your money.", "NTA\nYou do not owe her anything.", "NTA.

Saves a lot of money and time.", "NTA: The children are not in danger, which is the important part.\n\nYour step sister is a grown ass woman who can make her own decisions.
