They\u2019re too young for a babysitter and it sounds like all your family will be at the wedding so she can\u2019t rely on trusted family to help. \n\nIf you insist on no children then she won\u2019t be able to come. That\u2019s a straight consequence of your decision, not a threat. Don\u2019t ask a mother of a new baby to be apart from her child. You aren\u2019t a mother and don\u2019t yet understand what you\u2019re asking of her. Yes some people would be fine leaving their baby with a babysitter but that\u2019s sister\u2019s choice, not one you should insist she make.\n\nThere are compromises. She could ask her partner (if she has one) to stay at their accommodation with her baby, and pop back to see child regularly through the day. It\u2019s not ideal but it could possibly work. \n\nThis is a problem with potential solutions, but you both need to be willing to be more flexible than you currently are.", "OP \n\nI'm not sure if my answer is yta or nah.\n\nIts obvious though that you need to be told something.\n\nTo have a child free wedding you have to accept and acknowledge that not everyone will be able to make it. That has to be OK to you.\n\nHaving a child free wedding is like having a destination wedding.\n\nIf that's not OK then you have to compromise about your desires.", "NAH. I just don\u2019t think you fully understand what the consequences of your decision are. **Your** preferred solution to this impasse, that your SIL leaves her newborn at home and attends the wedding, is not going to work for them. So you have to cross that option off the table and stop pretending like it\u2019s the only solution. The choices you\u2019re left with are: allow your SIL an exception and let her bring the baby to the wedding, or she won\u2019t come at all. \n\nMake sure you and your partner agree on which path you want to take, and let your SIL know what you choose.

She shouldn't be trying to force you to accept her baby there, but at the same time, you can't be telling her she needs to leave her baby at home. If she says she can't come unless she brings the baby, then you need to decide whether you value her presence or the baby's absence more. It seems like you didn't even consider the possibility that she may not be able to come unless she brings the baby? But I don't know how that could not cross your minds. I'm split on E S H or N A H.

It\u2019s completely reasonable for her to not want to leave her newborn baby alone.", ">She's even threatened to not come to the wedding at all if we don't allow the baby.\n\nIt's child free and she doesn't want to be away from her baby. If she doesn't want to go than take her up on it.

That\u2019s the only reasonable option left to her. If you want her there, you\u2019re going to need to make an accommodation for her baby. A few weeks old is far too young to expect her to leave the child with someone else. If you\u2019re unwilling to make an exception, tell her that you completely understand she won\u2019t be able to attend\u2026but also don\u2019t be shocked if she finds it hurtful that you\u2019d rather her not be there then compromise your perfect wedding vibe.", "NAH.

Either your SIL can stay home with her newborn Or your SIL can attend with her newborn. Those are the options here. \n\nJust so you are aware OP: Even at 3-4 MONTHS old, babies need to be fed every 2-3 hours during the day and at least every 4-6 hours throughout the night - that\u2019s just the reality of the situation.", "NAH. \n\nYou're not wrong for wanting a child free wedding, which would include your new nibling. \n\nHowever, weeks after having a new baby, its also reasonable that she cannot conceive a way to attend her brother's wedding while leaving her child behind.\n\nYou don't need to compromise but perhaps you need to frame it in a way that she can have a longer RSVP time and if she does not feel she can attend without leaving her child at home or with a trusted family member in a hotel nearby to your reception, you and your fianc\u00e9 will miss her presence but obviously understand.", "NAH.\n\nLeaving a newborn is hard both physically and emotionally. Finding good childcare for a newborn is also hard - it\u2019s a skill set different from watching older children.\n\nMaking it even harder is that her support system will also be at your wedding. \n\nIs she breastfeeding? If so she\u2019s going to be pumping and acting very similar to if the baby was with her.\n\nNot going is a reasonable choice that you should respect. If you want her there then it\u2019s time to decide what\u2019s more important: having your aesthetic or having your SiL with a baby carrier/wrap coming in and out discreetly from your wedding and reception.", "YTA. Not for deciding you want a child free wedding. But for being an AH about your SIL not going. No one is leaving a newborn home for a wedding.  Period.", "I know it's against the grain but YTA. Specifically for this line:\n\n>She's even **threatened** to not come to the wedding at all if we don't allow the baby.\n\nIf you responded to that with \"I'm sorry you can't make it then, I hope we can celebrate with you later on,\" you'd have been golden. But you can't have it both ways. You can't refuse to accommodate her with her newborn AND be upset she doesn't come to the wedding. \n\nI understand that the majority of comments here will be something along the lines of \"NTA. Your wedding, your rules, invite whoever you want.\" However, it is incredibly difficult to leave a newborn. It's even harder when you can't leave them with family since they're all attending your wedding. She can't just drop the baby off with a teenager, newborn care can be expensive and hard to find. Not to mention, she may not emotionally be okay with being that far from her baby. This is why, back in the day (I swear I'm only 28 so don't ok boomer me) there were \"babe in arms\" exceptions for things like this. \n\nYou have two options, SIL comes with the baby or SIL doesn't come at all. Discuss with your fiance and chose together which one you prefer.", "YTA. The baby was born a few weeks ago you say? If it was me, I would totally skip your wedding rather than spend such a long time away from my newborn. You absolutely don\u2019t understand the logistics involved, nor the long term impact on someone who\u2019s at risk of suffering from PPD if she goes through extra unnecessary stress.", "ESH, leaning Y T A.\n\nYou need to accept that she cannot come to the wedding if her newborn is not allowed.\n\n>She's even threatened to not come to the wedding at all if we don't allow the baby.\n\nIt's reasonable for her not to attend given the circumstances. That's not a \"threat.\" \n\nSIL is slightly TA for continuing to push for the baby being allowed instead of simply RSVPing no.\n\nFWIW, I am all for child-free weddings, but I am generally of the opinion that there should be exceptions for babies in arms if it's important to you for the guest with the newborn to attend.", "I\u2019m gonna say a soft YTA- I may get ripped for this because I know people have very different opinions but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to ask a mom to leave a newborn baby. If I were her I would just not be coming to the wedding. Older kids are easier to leave with a babysitter but a newborn really shouldn\u2019t be separated from mom unless absolutely necessary. It may be your \u201cspecial day\u201d but I always approached our wedding as a party for our guests. The ceremony is for us, but the rest of it is for the guests. I would be doing anything I could to accommodate our guests. \n\nYou\u2019re not the biggest AH in the world, but I say soft YTA because that\u2019s your partner\u2018s sister and putting her in a situation where she feels like she can\u2019t come to your wedding or she has to leave her newborn baby is not very nice. Her and the baby are family", "INFO: Are you okay with the possibility of your SIL deciding not to come?\n\nWhether this is a N-T-A or E-S-H hinges on that for me, and you framed that as a \"threat\" so I'm suspecting no - and that's a problem. In a few months the baby will still be a newborn. She might not be comfortable with leaving the baby yet, and I'm guessing that most of her circle who she would trust to watch the baby might also be at your wedding? Her staying home wouldn't be to punish you, and it's self-centered to view it that way.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to make your wedding childfree, but then you have to accept the possibility that some guests who are parents may decide not to come, and you shouldn't interpret that as an insult. Just like if you plan a destination wedding, you have to accept that the expense/time will just be too much for some guests.", "NTA because your wedding, your rules, but she's not being unreasonable. Her baby is still an infant, it's not unreasonable for her to not want to leave the baby yet. Some people are fine doing this, others aren't. You both need to respect your respective wants and responsibilities.", "NTA. I can completely understand why she doesn't want to leave her baby behind, that is reasonable.\n\nSo she can stay home.\n\nIt is not reasonable for her to insist that she cannot get a sitter, cannot leave her baby with a friend, cannot do ANYTHING but try to force you to change your wedding around to accommodate her.", "NTA - if the baby is that young, then she should stay home from the wedding to care for it. A wedding isn't going to be a great environment for a fussy newborn.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think you understand what newborns are like.", "NTA - its her choice to come or not, you made it clear and she has to make a choice. thats just how the cookie crumbles.", "NTA\n\nHowever with child-free weddings and newborn babies you're going to have people who aren't going to be there because they couldn't make it. \n\nIt's sad but kids are a priority in their mind", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Tell the sitter she'll text and/or pop in a few times throughout the night, but the sitter isn't expected to contact her unless there's an emergency.\n\nNow, just for the heck of it, let's flip the script. Imagine a few years from now you have a newborn about the same age as your SIL's baby is now and are invited to a no-kids event. What would you do in that situation?
