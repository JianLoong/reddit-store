When I was pregnant, my friend, Michelle, my age, had given me a gorgeous necklace as a present for my pregnancy. She said I could do what I wanted with it. It came in a beautiful little box and ribbon and I had planned to keep it in the family. \n\nRecently, to celebrate my son (Matt)'s first birthday, my sister flew in from England to help with my baby. My sister is a jeweler as well, conveniently. She does live far and we often communicate only through text or call, and the COVID situation from 2021 made it even harder to see eachother. I never really discussed the necklace with my sister until then, as I always thought it was a cheaper present, until I put it on when we were going out for dinner. I'd left Matt with a babysitter and we were at the restaurant when my sister had asked where I got the necklace from.\n\nI was happy she noticed but told her it was a gift, and my sister asked me to look at it. I didn't think much of it until she mentioned it seemed expensive, and after a bit of searching and checking around we found out it was actually worth a ton. I won't go into specifics, and no, not millions or tens of thousands of dollars, but enough for me to make enough for a bit to help support my family or keep it in the family as an expensive necklace. \n\nMichelle also found out, most likely from me messaging family and friends, and messaged me back asking for the necklace back. She apparently had been gifted the necklace as well from a relative but also thought it was cheap, and I replied back that I intended to keep it. Michelle started calling me selfish, saying it was hers first and she never knew the value. Now my husband and sister are saying Michelle shouldn't have given it away, but I know Michelle could use the money and I think it's true she never knew the value too, or she wouldn't have given it to me.

That would be \u201ccheap\u201d as far as jewelry goes and therefore I would never take it to a jeweler or get it appraised/insured.

OP is not a mind reader so the real thoughts and feelings on this matter have to be talked about. \n\nOP never said the friend thought the necklace was worthless. The friend just didn\u2019t realize how much it was worth (edit: cheap can mean anything, I doubt she told OP she thought it was cheap at the time of gifting). Btw I don\u2019t get how many people are offended that the item was regifted in the first place. Who cares! \n\nAnyway, some friends can be like family to people and if there\u2019s room for understanding and forgiveness between sisters for example I don\u2019t see any reason that would not be possible between friends. Nobody is perfect. OP obviously cherishes the friendship since she is really torn.\n\nEdit: if the friend thought the necklace would be worth $50 for example, that would not be the same as a crappy thing from the dollar store but just a nice gift. Turns out the necklace is worth $5K. In comparison, $50 would have been \u201ccheap\u201d since the real value is a hundred times that. In that case, I get why it is now called \u201ccheap\u201d."]}
