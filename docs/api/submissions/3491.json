When I was pregnant, my friend, Michelle, my age, had given me a gorgeous necklace as a present for my pregnancy. She said I could do what I wanted with it. It came in a beautiful little box and ribbon and I had planned to keep it in the family. \n\nRecently, to celebrate my son (Matt)'s first birthday, my sister flew in from England to help with my baby. My sister is a jeweler as well, conveniently. She does live far and we often communicate only through text or call, and the COVID situation from 2021 made it even harder to see eachother. I never really discussed the necklace with my sister until then, as I always thought it was a cheaper present, until I put it on when we were going out for dinner. I'd left Matt with a babysitter and we were at the restaurant when my sister had asked where I got the necklace from.\n\nI was happy she noticed but told her it was a gift, and my sister asked me to look at it. I didn't think much of it until she mentioned it seemed expensive, and after a bit of searching and checking around we found out it was actually worth a ton. I won't go into specifics, and no, not millions or tens of thousands of dollars, but enough for me to make enough for a bit to help support my family or keep it in the family as an expensive necklace. \n\nMichelle also found out, most likely from me messaging family and friends, and messaged me back asking for the necklace back. She apparently had been gifted the necklace as well from a relative but also thought it was cheap, and I replied back that I intended to keep it. Michelle started calling me selfish, saying it was hers first and she never knew the value. Now my husband and sister are saying Michelle shouldn't have given it away, but I know Michelle could use the money and I think it's true she never knew the value too, or she wouldn't have given it to me.

EVER. that's just how they operate. once a piece has been sold by a jewelry shop the only reason for it to be appraised is for insurance purposes. call it a cartel, call it whatever you want, that's just simple fact. if it's a 10,000 dollar necklace, nobody will get even a thousand bucks for it. a pawn shop will offer 200-300.\n\nso you basically bragged that at some point, somebody in your friend's family paid a shitload of money for something that instantly became non-sellable. the businesses that sell jewelry simply will not allow any other outcome. if your jeweler friend is honest she'll tell you the truth about that.\n\nyour friend is also being tactless and silly. even if you gave it back, she won't get but a couple hundred for it, tops. she didn't know what it was worth at the time, but it's not like she could ever have gotten it's actual value.", "NTA how cheap is your friend.

It's true that your friend gave it to you, so you'd be technically justified in doing what you want with it, but I have sympathy for someone who made a decision without knowing the full picture.

If my friend accidentally gifted me something valuable by mistake, and this was a friend I cared about, I would work with them to figure something something out.

And even if you are within your rights to keep the gift (which OP is), I still think that makes your behavior asshole-ish.\n\nI just can't imagine my friend coming to me, panicking that they accidentally gave away something very expensive, and essentially saying back, \"ha, sucks to suck! Finders keepers!\" The friend's behavior isn't great here, from start to finish, but OP, is this someone you care about? Do you want to keep this friendship into the future?

All of these make it NTA for me. \n\nI would change my vote if any of the following circumstances applied:\n- she was borrowing the necklace\n- she was gifted it by accident (grabbed the wrong necklace, mixed up who it was going to)\n\nThe friend deliberately regifted what she thought was a cheap necklace and only wants it back for the money. Not for sentimental reasons. Its not finders keepers when OP was given the gift. Plus OP clearly appreciated the gift before knowing the actual financial value or wouldn\u2019t be wearing it.

But that's just how I roll.", "It wasn't by accident though that she gave it away - she did it entirely purposefully and did so in a way to make it seem new, when she was really regifting something from a relative that she didn't use.\n\nThis wasn't like mixing up sets of earrings where one is expensive and one is not, she chose to specifically give OP this necklace. And maybe that is because she thought it wasn't worth much.\n\nBut that doesn't mean she then gets to ask for it back because it is worth money actually and she had never checked or asked her family if it was valuable, because that isn't how gifting WORKS. You don't get to reclaim gifts that you undervalued as junk and gave away because you saw them as junk.\n\nIf you sell a masterpiece painting for $10 to a stranger and it turns out to be worth 10 billion dollars, they're not an AH for telling you no if you ask for it back, you're just out of luck, because you didn't do your due diligence in asserting its value. You can feel regret about it, but they're not an AH for turning you down.\n\nIf OP was genuinely considering selling it, the right thing to do might be to offer it back to her or to split profits with her because they are friends.\n\nBut it doesn't sound like Michelle wants to sell it either so much as just have it, because it has some value.\n\nOP is allowed to say no and it isn't an AH thing to say no to such a request if OP intends to use it as a necklace. But it is likely Michelle will still be upset because her greed is talking here quite honestly - she gave it away thinking it was worthless, and only wants it back because it isn't.\n\nIf your friendship is so fragile that not giving them exactly what they want all the time will break it, then it isn't a good friendship. Michelle was allowed to ask, OP was allowed to say no. Lesson should be learned about not giving stuff away that you never learned the value of because you are never owed stuff back just because you decide you want it now.", "If your friend re-gifted something to you without even realising what it was, and thinking it was cheap, you have an AH friend.", "Stop being sensible! We keep that for BoRU, here we do pitchforks and red flags", "> But doing so is an AH move.\n\nLol, no.  Re-gifting a person something you believe to be worthless then asking for it back a year after you find out it's not worthless is the AH move.  \n\nMy only real beef with OP here is not keeping the value of the necklace on the downlow and apparently blabbing to enough people about it that word got back to Michelle.", "This is such a strange take in my opinion \ud83e\udd23 it\u2019s great that you\u2019d return it.
