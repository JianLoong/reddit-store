When I was pregnant, my friend, Michelle, my age, had given me a gorgeous necklace as a present for my pregnancy. She said I could do what I wanted with it. It came in a beautiful little box and ribbon and I had planned to keep it in the family. \n\nRecently, to celebrate my son (Matt)'s first birthday, my sister flew in from England to help with my baby. My sister is a jeweler as well, conveniently. She does live far and we often communicate only through text or call, and the COVID situation from 2021 made it even harder to see eachother. I never really discussed the necklace with my sister until then, as I always thought it was a cheaper present, until I put it on when we were going out for dinner. I'd left Matt with a babysitter and we were at the restaurant when my sister had asked where I got the necklace from.\n\nI was happy she noticed but told her it was a gift, and my sister asked me to look at it. I didn't think much of it until she mentioned it seemed expensive, and after a bit of searching and checking around we found out it was actually worth a ton. I won't go into specifics, and no, not millions or tens of thousands of dollars, but enough for me to make enough for a bit to help support my family or keep it in the family as an expensive necklace. \n\nMichelle also found out, most likely from me messaging family and friends, and messaged me back asking for the necklace back. She apparently had been gifted the necklace as well from a relative but also thought it was cheap, and I replied back that I intended to keep it. Michelle started calling me selfish, saying it was hers first and she never knew the value. Now my husband and sister are saying Michelle shouldn't have given it away, but I know Michelle could use the money and I think it's true she never knew the value too, or she wouldn't have given it to me.
