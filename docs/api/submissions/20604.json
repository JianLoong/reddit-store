Sometimes shoulders and hands because of grabbing onto the rails), plus a tendency for my legs to fall asleep and it's a lot easier to hit the circulation back into my legs sitting then standing (mainly cause on busses and trains I can't just walk around so I can only stop or shake my leg a bit. But sitting I can pull it up and literally hit it back and forth. Whole thing. Not the point). I have some other stuff too but those only occasionally impede my ability to do things (migraines and abdominal pain. So, not always an issue but on bad days standing it a nightmare). \n\nI can stand. I'm not incapable of standing, on good days I can go for long hikes or go to concerts without seats. Key point being good days,  however I also have a lot of bad days and it isn't feasible for me to stay home on every bad day. So even in a lot of pain whether that's the regular amount of pain, a lower amount (never zero though), or more pain than usual I do still have to go places unless I'm super burnout from doing so. Unless it's an incredibly incredibly bad day I again, can stand. However doing so does hurt a lot and can decrease my ability to do things later. Like  I'm standing and walking all day, so when friends want to hang out I have to say no, or when I get home I can't do things I enjoy or catch up on any work I may be behind on because of pain or exhaustion. So standing is a thing I can do near 100% of the time, but it will on many days impede my ability to do stuff later so I'm often very picky about whether I should walk somewhere, bus, drive, etc. \n\nOn busses, if there's a free spot I'll sit in it immediately. I'm not going to choose to stand if it can be avoided, some exceptions do apply though because it can be beneficial to me in certain situations. However, like, on busy busses and trains it isn't always possible to do so because of a few reasons. Either all the seats are already taken, all the seats are always down and they aren't all taken but people are standing around them, or different handicap seats have to be pulled down to sit in to make room for wheelchairs and it's packed and people are in front of them so difficult to sit there. I'm mentally ill and nuerodivergent so, asking to sit places is an issue for me due to that as well. Beyond issues relating to that, I am young and don't look disabled so I don't want to run the risk of someone yelling at me for being entitled or faking it. And sometimes it's just difficult to get to the seats because it would require a lot of shuffling around, and in 97% of cases I'm not gonna just drop to the floor if I can't sit, and normally when that is the case I wouldn't be out and about (though I have had some awkward conversations at shopping centers with security) so I don't want to have to bother people to do it. Because it sucks that I'm used to not always being able to accommodate myself, but, as much as I hate the pian it's there. A lot. So dealing with it is awful and taxing, but is also something I've learned to live with and deal with, so I just don't always try to sit if it's difficult.

If it was that much on an issue she could have stood up instead so she didn\u2019t have to sit next to someone, but to take up 2 seats on a crowded train and refuse to move her bag is rude.", "I'm sorry for whatever trauma you have gone through, but it absolutely is sexist and hateful to judge every male as an attacker, and refuse to display common courtesy to someone just because they are male, particularly when using public infrastructure. Labelling every male as a potential attacker and discriminating against them because of this incorrect label, is hateful and sexist. I can't think of a better definition actually. TO suggest it's ok to be hateful, judgmental and inconsiderate, purely because someone is male, is so warped.", ">It's not sexist to prioritize our safety.\n\nWhat would you say to someone that says \"It's not racist to prioritize our safety.\" ?\n\nSee what I did there?\n\nYou are being sexist and an asshole.", "Nah, Sydney - I'd assume a lot of big cities are the same because of the sheer number of people around.", "Finally someone that gets it.", "My favorite is that they are pompously affronted that OP is \u201cjudging\u201d without knowing, like she should wait to be harassed or groped because nOt AlL mEn.", "All due respect, I don't think children should be standing on buses any more than any one else. They are small and projectile. Not all children are capable of standing and not all older ladies are incapable of standing.", "I can understand adults wanting their kids seated in public areas like this though- kids that are walking or standing freely on light rails ot public transport with people shuffling and moving around quickly can be stolen or harmed in a matter of seconds. Having them seated is safer. \n\nIt\u2019s not really about being polite- it\u2019s about being safe. \n\nPersonal Safety is not less important than other peoples comfort or view of you.", "I'm a woman and would find this incredibly obnoxious and I would move seats away from you.", "Don't do that. That's fucking weird. People don't want to sit next to strangers if they can avoid it. You're making people feel very uncomfortable doing that.", "You think standing is a better solution?  She doesn\u2019t want one \u201ccreepy\u201d man sitting next to her because they\u2019ll harass her so let\u2019s have her get up and stand on a busy train so that she\u2019ll be around multiple \u201ccreepy\u201d men.", "Sure, but it wasn't a previous experience *with that person*.\n\nOr even any particular action that the person did, or \"vibe\" they gave off, or anything.\n\nIt was literally \"he's a man, therefore he might sexually harass me. If it was a woman, she wouldn't\".\n\nThat's sexist. It's fine if you want your daughter to be sexist, it's your (or rather her) choice to do so.\n\nBut I'd have zero sympathy if she (or you on her behalf) complains about the negative effects of sexism she experiences.", "Couldn\u2019t u also use that against a certain race? That also has a huge data with crime statistics you really wanna go down that path?", "I'm not saying her bag should have a seat. That IS rude, I'm a commuter, I would have been pissed also. She should have just stood up.\n\nI am saying it isn't wrong to use your bag to pick a seat mate you feel safe next to when possible. And that men getting hurt feelings is not as harmful as women being physically unsafe so I am not going to fault her for wanting to protect herself when possible by waving over some other woman to sit w her.", "Many women actually understand what this behaviour is and don\u2019t mind at all.\n\nI feel safe when another woman sits next to me on public transport even when there are empty seats and I\u2019m betting she\u2019s seeking that too.

Leave me and other people the fuck alone. I'd get up and move if someone did that. I'd assume you're targeting me. Weird weird weird.", "Unless you fly on one of the airlines that don't do that, like Southwest.", "Not all men, eh? But somehow, somewhere, it\u2019s always a man. What do you think is worse, a couple guys standing or a woman being harassed and scared?", "I talk as a human being, most people want to be left alone and have space for them if the train is empty. Men or women", "There\u2019s always that one person that just has to turn it around and make men seem like the bad guys cus women are just tiny little innocent creatures who can\u2019t do any harm (sarcasm obviously)"]}
