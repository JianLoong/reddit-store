You didn\u2019t pay for your bag to have a seat. Taking up more than one seat on public transit automatically makes you the AH.

There was a lady who had her suitcase in front of her, making it so 3 seats were unavailable to sit in. We ended up standing on a warm train with a handful of people for over an hour. It was so rude of that woman to watch people walking back and forth trying to find a seat when all she had to do was move her suitcase.
