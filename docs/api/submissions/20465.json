Just messaged", "NTA, your wife's body doesn't belong to your mother. It sounds like these photos have made her feel insecure, and maybe jealous, but that's not your wife's fault.

NTA", "NTA\n\nWhile I get the thought process of being uncomfortable with this situation especially as she is a person from an older time where this kinda thing was probably near unheard of, this does not come close to excusing the reaction she had and straight up cutting you guys off. A lengthy conversation and likely reluctant acceptance on her part is what should have happened. It's not her business at the end of the day and you and your wife are independent adults. Hopefully with time she will cool down a bit and be open to talking again.\n\nAlso your wife's response is killing me still hahahah", "NTA, love your wife's reaction and good on you for supporting her and not dragging your knuckles", "I absolutely LOVE your wife's response\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 NTA!", "NTA.

You sound pretty awesome too considering how fast you shut your mom down.", "NTA, but I think the photos are the least of your problems...\n\n\nShe is using the tactic of not talking to you as a power move to stablish dominance.

I would ignore her and let her come to you.  If she keeps it up, tell her she is being inappropriate, there is nothing wrong with the photos, and she owes both of you an apology.", "Best response to Dad seeing them!", "Your wife is brilliant.\n\nAs are you - telling her to speak to your wife.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.

BUT her concerns are just that:  HERS.  If you don't share her concerns, than tough noogies for her.

You could do it, I really believe that.", "I was proud of that, lol", "Seconding this. You need to deal with your family when they're being unkind, unreasonable, etc. And your wife deals with her family in turn.", "You have good reason to be loudly proud. Your wife sounds like an absolute winner in the best possible way. Take care of yourselves and your little family. \n\nPlease point your mom in another direction. I was blessed to have two incredible sets of in-laws in my life. I cherished my time with them. I am the same way with my sons and their wives. It is the full circle of contentment for everyone.", "It might not be your mum who originally found them. Do you think she would have shown your dad if she found them first?", "No, a spouse definitely gets a say.  Your spouse opinion should matter to you", "I mean... it's a little out there- but it's a great way to shame her into stopping that shit", "Mom's response about the photos tells us everything we need to know about the whole body issue thing. lololol", "Thanks for this. I need a coach like you!", "Ugh. Not sure.", "Yeah, sorry to put that thought out there. I should probably go back to lurking.", "May I ask why you keep requesting commenters message you rather than keeping the conversation on this post?  I've never seen anyone do that before.", "Possible I guess", "Super personal stuff!", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou married.  Your priority is your wife, not your mother.  \n\nMy kids are grown.  **I expect them to support their partners over me, because they are adults now.**  That's how it is supposed to be, because they have started new families and that's their priority now, not me.  \n\nThe decisions you and your wife make are your business, not your mother's business.  She needs to accept this, and handle her emotions about it, and not burden you with these.  She's capable of doing this, and showing both of you the respect due to other adults.\n\nIf I have issues with my kids' or their partners' decisions, that's my issue to handle, myself, quietly.  To them, they get respect, love and care, not attitude.", "No aren\u2019t TA but you handled this terribly.\n\nI\u2019m sure your wife signed a modeling release form and because of that, she can\u2019t ask that the stuff be removed even it she wanted it removed.\n\nJust tell your mom that.", "NTA. Enjoy the silence.", "NTA- they're not even your photos to take down. You're not the photographer, and you're not in them. Your wife already said no to her (and I love her reaction to her). You're certainly not going to bully your own wife. \n\nShe doesn't have to look at them if she doesn't want to.", "Probably your wife signed a waiver giving ownership to the photographer and there's not really a whole lot your or she can do even if you wanted to.  I understand your moms reactions but there may not be much else to do.  I could be wrong though.  NTAH.", "NTA. Its not effecting her in any way and as such, isnt any of her business.\n  \n   That was a great response on your wifes part. Lol", "NTA\n\nIf the mom thought they were so pornographic, why did she show them to her husband?", "Yep you\u2019re right.", "Thanks. And she meant it! Lol", "Makes no sense!", "INFO : did your mom specify any reason?\n\nI'm reminded of a thread a few weeks ago: a guy found his friend's lingerie photos online, friend wasn't apologetic enough, so the guy asked another friend \"for advice\" knowing that 2nd friend is a gossip. The girl in the photos turned out to be a teacher, the gossipy friend spread the photos around and the girl in the photos was fired. They were in a pretty religious country IIRC so he'd basically made her unemployable.\n\nRight now it sounds like pearl clutching, and the cold shoulder treatment doesn't speak to your mom's maturity... but you know her best of course. Could there be a legitimate reason?", "Ok, that\u2019s fair. I do have a theory.", "Now you have me thinking lol", "I hope it gets sorted! \n\nAt any rate, I'm happy to see your wife is confident about her body and the modeling she did, and to see the two of you are a team!", "She\u2019s very confident about it! And I do love the photos.", "Without giving away their personal information, why are they asking people to message them privately?"]}
