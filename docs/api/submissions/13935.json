We met two years ago and we been living together for around six months. Before moving with me she was living in her college dorm but she got kicked out for various rules violations (getting in late, having guests over, that kind of stuff). She doesn't have a job although she used to have one before.

I have been paying for groceries, rent, bills etc for all of these months which is not a problem for me. \n\nI usually am the one doing grocery shopping after work, last monday I noticed we were kinda low on some stuff, so I asked my gf to make a grocery list, send it to me and I'll go to the store that night. In that list she included cigarettes which I decided not to get because I'd rather save the money in case we need it for something else. I'm low on money now as I've lend money to my sister because my nephew needed surgery and she needed to pay for it (not that bad, just a broken leg but the surgery was expensive and her health care is not good), my sister is a single mom so she couldn't ask her son's father to pay for the surgery, I gave her a quite big part of my check. My gf started looking for the cigarettes after I came home, she asked where they were and I told her I didn't bought them. She was immediately mad and we started arguing, she told me I'm supposed to provide for her and that includes her cigarettes. I told her I couldn't afford them and she tried to blame my sister for it, saying that I shouldn't have given her  all my  money. I told her she should get a job and pay for her own groceries if she thinks I'm not doing a good job. She also called me controlling because I'm trying to dictate what she does with her life (like if she smokes or doesn't) and said what I'm doing is financial abuse, although that's not it, I'm not denying her any money, just cigarettes because it's not something necessary.

In some places, one pack is about 20$. If she absolutely has to smoke something, get her a 3 pack of cigars for a $1, and tell her that's all you can afford. Either she'll stop asking because the cigars are terrible or because she'll know she's been bested.", "NTA, but I might communicate this explicitly when you make the list--say \"I'll get everything else, but the budget's a bit tight for cigarettes.\" This way, she's not expecting a pack when she comes home, and fix-less way too late to get any herself any from the store. \n\nSource: I'm admittedly a bit of a caffeine addict, but I did not have a great time when someone offered to add my groceries to their list, I asked for a Diet Coke, went about my day without coffee/tea expecting Diet Coke later, and came home to no Diet Coke and a judgy lecture.", "I am a casual smoker and it always drove me nuts when my exes would constantly bum off of me....... it's also annoying when someone says they want to quit to your face and then ask you for smokes, like do I choose to enable them or not?

If she does decide to quit due to lack of funds, brace yourself it will be hard for her to do.", "This is a tough one.
