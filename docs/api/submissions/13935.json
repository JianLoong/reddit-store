Do you know if her parents tend to pay for anything else for her? Is she used to them paying for everything?\n\ud83d\udea9 Getting kicked out of her dorm is a huge red flag. She's 23, not 13 and should be able to handle some basic rules and responsibilities. \n\ud83d\udea9 She had a job before but doesn't now. How long has she been out of work and why did she leave her job? Was she fired? How many jobs has she had and how long did she last in any of them? Did she mention coworker drama when she was working or hate her boss for no explicit reason?\n\ud83d\udea9 Saying that she'll get another job only after she graduates could be another potential red flag. She only has one semester left. Does she talk about getting a job after graduation? Does she look to see what places might be hiring once she's ready? Does she ever talk about wanting to work at a specific company or starting a business after graduation? If not, you should be worried.\n\ud83d\udea9 Blaming your sister for accepting the money for her son's surgery is a colossal red flag. That's your FAMILY! Of course you offered to help! Who wouldn't? Was she even concerned about your nephew?\n\ud83d\udea9 Accusing you of financial abuse for not buying her ONE non-essential item, ONE TIME, because you honestly didn't have the money for it is absolutely a gaslighting technique. Also, saying that you're not trying hard enough to provide for her when she clearly has everything she needs minus cancer sticks is also manipulation and gaslighting. You are obviously not trying to control her life and force her into quitting her smoking habit. Hell, it wouldn't even be abuse just to refused to never buy them for her again! It would actually be better if you didn't. Buying her something addictive and unhealthy because she demands it is a sign of codependency. What if she said that about buying her alcohol?\n\nThink about how long you've known your gf and think about her attitudes towards money, school, work, and general adult responsibilities.
