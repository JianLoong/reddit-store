She isn't. She's lonely, and it's way out in the country. I try to keep her busy with the grand kids, while i do upkeep and yard work. I think it's playing right into her emotions.", "I agree that the OP needs to take this seriously. \n\nChances are that his next step will be to tell his mother that the property needs to be in his name for the loans, and pressuring her to sign it over to him.", "Let's hope she hasn't already.", "No idea. But a part of me keeps telling me I shouldn't have said anything, and maybe he means well.", "It was technically a pre-approval. I don't think it's possible to get a loan to build something on somebody else's property.", "Yeah.", "Well, I'm not sure it's a bad as it sounds. I still agree with you, and there's room to build his own damn house nearby, but I don't know if it's a ploy on her emotional stability to downgrade her responsibilities while keeping her company.  And getting a free house while he's at it.", "There's a lot more to it. But there's no way it was going to be kept under 3000 characters.", "How does making your mother move into a garage and taking over the house \"mean well\"?", "You can get a bank loan and spend it on anything, technically. If he thought he would only need 10K or something he could (in theory) get an unsecured bank loan rather than a mortgage that would need to be secured on a property.    \nI'd be more worried he might pressure your mother to sign the property over to him or leave it all to him in her will.", "He may not be, but surely there is a better option for them that building a garage there are actually some super adorable tiny home layouts that are quite open and spacious they are pretty genius and make use of all space in smart ways.", "I mean, asking about a will at a funeral is still pretty odd tbh. What else is there?", "I'm struggling to make sense of it as well.", "I didnt think about that. They hand out HELOCS like crazy anymore.", "My parents made me promise not to sell the place. We don't come from much, and they struggled tooth and nail every day for it. There's considerable property with it, and it's extremely high maintenence. Which I've helped with, even after I moved out a long time ago. \n\nThey tried giving it to me in the past under a promise that they continue to live there, and I was agreeable, but i thought they deserved being paid for it, and i would insist i did. They refused the money and tried to convince me to accept a \"right to live\" will or something. Didn't make sense to me at the time. I told them to put it in a trust out of fairness, but they never did. \n\nAt the same time, I didn't want to slight my younger siblings. Ya never know when somebody might fall into hard times and need somewhere to live. \n\nAlso, there was no will.", "No Will, that's not good. Maybe, talk to your mom about getting one done. Like I said, sounds like the brother has big plans. Maybe talk with the other siblings too. They need to know what's going on.", "This is probably what I needed to hear. \n\nHe isn't a bad person. He may be acting erratically because he can't deal with the loss as well. I don't want to talk with anybody until he's willing to be involved. I don't want him to think he's being conspired on. Then again, it may be too late by the time that happens.", "If your brother is talking about \"taking over the property\" and is planning to move your mom and live in her house, it is past time to conspire on him.\n\nYou sound really nonchalant for someone whose mother's in a situation that could quickly slide into elder abuse. Your mom needs a lawyer to help her sort out a will, and she needs solid legal advice before your brother builds anything or makes any upgrades to her property. Your mom may be in good enough health now not to just sign what he gives her, but that might not be the case later on.\n\nYou're making a lot of excuses for him, but here's the thing: his intentions don't really matter. Even if he means well, there are still a ton of ways his plan could screw her over. Protect your mom. If your brother gets mad about her consulting a professional about her estate and her property, that'll tell you something about where he's coming from with all this.", "Act on the facts. He may not be a bad person but his actions are not pretty. Why should his actions be kept secret from the rest of the family?"]}
