I\u2019m extremely proud of him. All of them would require him moving quite far and while he won\u2019t have to worry about his tuition fees, he will only be eligible for the minimum amount as our parents earn over the limit. \n\nMy parents refused to help me for my university at all as they\u2019re extremely traditional and don\u2019t think women should go to university, so they made it clear I\u2019d be on my own. So I worked through my undergraduate degree, my masters and now my PhD. I didn\u2019t know when George was born whether they\u2019d pay but when he hit high school they started saving. It didn\u2019t last long though, my brother didn\u2019t do all that well in the first few years and his practice exams didn\u2019t go well at all in 4th year, but our parents have always told him he was \u2018fine but not smart\u2019 and so I think that got in his head a bit. When he failed his practice exams, they spent the money on an expensive holiday abroad (which neither of us were invited to). George confided in me his ambitions and that he really wanted to go to university so I helped him study. He worked hard and did well enough to be able to take the classes the course he wanted to do asked for and I\u2019ve been helping him when he needs it, but it\u2019s mostly just been reassurance that he\u2019s doing a good job and I\u2019m proud of him regardless of what happens. I started saving the second he confided in me he wanted to go. It\u2019s not much since I have my own tuition and stuff to pay for, but it\u2019s enough to match the amount he\u2019ll get on his student loan for first year (about 7k). \n\nHe\u2019s waiting for his final result but he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to one specific university, which is the same university I went to for my undergraduate degree and therefore I know that without parental help he\u2019ll be screwed and so I will continue to save and help out where I can. Our parents walked in on me explaining to George the terms of him getting access to this money -I\u2019ll transfer him a specific amount every month he\u2019s at uni on the 1st of the month, but any big deductions like textbooks I\u2019ll pay for directly and deduct that from the monthly amount. (I\u2019m just trying to make sure he doesn\u2019t do the classic blow it all in one go). My parents blew up and said I\u2019d overstepped, that I undermined them and was absolutely out of line and it\u2019s not my responsibility. I agreed and told them it wasn\u2019t, but if they\u2019d been responsible and had believed in them I wouldn\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong but I also feel extremely guilty.

The would prefer your brother not going to university instead of looking like they didn't help.", "Not the asshole, your parents suck, and I am glad that you helped your brother. Sorry about your parents acting misogynistic, because everyone has the right to study.", "NTA, but your parents are for spending the money saved for Uni on a vacation for themselves.  That says it all IMO.  Now they feel guilty and shamed because you've stepped up where they blew him off. They are unable to deal with those feelings and have turned it onto you for making them feel that way. You are a great sister.", "NTA. Good on you for your own studies and for supporting your brother! Also, I think calling your parents \"traditional\" is being very generous to them.", "NTA.  I wonder if your parents wanted to send anyone to university.  They don\u2019t pay for you as you are female then don\u2019t pay for your brother for \u2026 some reason.

I get it old fashioned but still get them a chance and 2) they did save for your brother but then suddenly lost all hope in him to do well? Uhh ok. 3) why are they getting mad at you when clearly you are doing the right thing and helping your brother in life and they caused this whole kerfuffle by spending the money they saved for him. That is then causing you to spend your money because you actually care for him and believe in him.", "NTA, you are a fantastic sibling to help give your brother support you never had instead of making him be in the same position. Your  parent suck! They blew his money because they didn't believe in him, you gave him the confidence to pass and get to where he wanted, no they are mad because you get to play hero when they should have in their eyes, i'm sorry your parent weren't there to support you or your brother, so well done on being a parent he deserves", "Definitely NTA. Your parents are clearly angered because you're helping your brother out, and they're not, because they spent it all. I don't want to make judgements of character but the way your parents have behaved towards your brother and ESPECIALLY you (with the whole not thinking women should study thing) is very, very messed up.

You have nothing to feel guilty about, you\u2019re doing a wonderful thing emotionally and financially helping your brother where your parents failed him. NTA", "You are doing something that has no benefitfor you, how can that be an AH move again? NTA", "NTA.  First, congratulations on all your academic achievements!  Doctoral programs are brutal and costly, and you are doing it on your own.  Your parents failed you and your brother, and you are acting more adult than they are.  \n\nDon't feel guilty - you are giving your brother a chance at a better circumstance.", "You're lovely. Well done on being an amazing big sister. Absolutely NTA. They're just mad because you showed them up.", "NTA. Everyone should be so fortunate to have a sister like you!", "Yes. I understand they feel/look bad and I probably could have worded it better and not snapped at them in front of my brother. I do feel bad, they have a lot of shortcomings as parents but I know that they love us somewhere deep down, but I don\u2019t think that that excuses their behaviour.", "Traditional was the kindest way I could think of to word it, they admittedly have a lot of shortcomings.", "I\u2019m not sure. I was always aware I\u2019d be on my own for university but it seemed for while that they really genuinely thought about George, although they\u2019ve always told him he\u2019s not academically gifted and so he stopped trying but it seems like they just decided he\u2019s stupid (he\u2019s not). Neither of them went to university and part of me wonders if they resent us for that.", "I'm not gonna dictate how you have a relationship with your fam and how you feel about them, but I think you are giving them too much credit, I would have cut them out long ago where I you, add to that how they started to treat your brother and how happy they were to easily give up on him and go spending that money on themselves, all I see is someone more concerned with appereances than their own kids.", "So you went to uni with no help and very little deduction because of  parents being stupid AND you\u2019ve been tutoring your brother AND you\u2019ve been mentally helping him AND you\u2019ve been saving up money for him whilst paying your own debts AND you are also helping him be financially smart? That\u2019s a hard one\u2026 NTA!!! You are amazing, go girlie!!!!!!", "NTA remind your parents that you and George will be choosing their old-age home.", "NTA. Learn to not give a fuck about the opinions of your asshole parents.", "NTA. You are a wonderful sibling.", "Lmao NTA, I'm sorry but your parents seems heartless. Just curious but what were their plans for you and your brother if they were against sending you to uni?", "NTA. You haven't done anything wrong, your parents are collosal AHs here and it's not your obligation to spare them from the knowledge that they are AH parents. They are lucky George doesn't tell Lenny about the rabbits.", "You didn't do anything wrong to feel guilty about.  Your parents are the ones who should feel guilty.  There's nothing wrong with trying to help your brother since your parents can't.  NTA.  Your parents are.", "NTA. Every parent that can pay for their kid to get a college education but refuses to do so is a piece of trash. You should have told them they are right. It isn't your responsibility. But since they are too busy taking vacations to be bothered with wctusl parenthood you had to step in and do their job for them.", "Right?! I assumed OP\u2019s title was mistyped she she meant \u201cAITA for NOT giving my bother money for school.\u201d Imaging being *angry* that your kids love and support each other so much that they\u2019ll step in and cover for *your* failures!\n\nNTA OP, an you\u2019re an amazing sister!", "I agree with you wholeheartedly about mom and dad not wanting to look bad but the parents are, frankly, morons on top of being selfish and lacking in parental empathy.  There is no indication that they were reticent about expressing their beliefs re women and education, so all in their circle already know that OP got through a doctoral program without their help.  They've looked quite bad for a while.  They were apparently cool with others knowing this -- they only got obstreperous upon the possibility that others will find out they were lacking in regard to their SON.", "You had the right to snap at them. I would have went NC over them for not helping me, based on sexism.", ">\tI probably could have worded it better and not snapped at them\n\nMmmm hard disagree. They absolutely deserved a good snapping. You could\u2019ve snapped harder IMHO!", "I think your parents are very lucky you didn\u2019t cut them out years ago. You are still giving them the benefit of the doubt. I never did my mother which eventually led to her getting much needed help but my situation was different. One thing that wasn\u2019t was that she only gave me conditional support in college (not monetary because she didn\u2019t have it to give) and even that she ended up conceding she was wrong about me. Hopefully your parents will realize that about your brother. I struggled in high school but not so much in college. I think your brother will be the same. It\u2019s harder work but mostly in a subject you\u2019re interested in which ti me makes it easier!", "Nothing like sabotaging your own kid!", "Bingo. I hate that. As parents, we're supposed to want better and more for our kids. Not keeping them down. Why have them then?? You are an amazing sister and human. Glad you and your bro have each other. Rock on!", "NTA! You\u2019re an amazing sister. You\u2019ve done a great job at supporting your brother and encouraging him to pursue higher education. You did not overstep, you stepped up because your parents wouldn\u2019t. It\u2019s disgusting that your parents would spent your brother\u2019s college fund on an expensive holiday.", "Your parents are trying to project their own guilt onto you, it\u2019s that simple. 100% NTA.", "NTA don't let your parents guilt of their failure as parents transfer to you. You are extremely kind to help your brother out like this.", "NTA. Have you looked into whether he can get additional funding as an independent/estranged student? I know for Scotland you can get a higher level of funding/the parents income isn't considered if you're estranged/not getting any parental support. May not be the situation exactly but could be worthwhile investigating. Hope all his exams go well!", "Girrrl, you're doing the most amazing and loving thing I've read here!!! You are a star in this dark world and your brother is blessed to have you. \n\nBut what's wrong with your mom and dad, why don't they want you guys to succeed? Tradition aside, where's the love and support and encouragement from them? It almost feels like they were happy your brother failed so they could take a trip. \n\nTotally NTA!!!!", "NTA parents that make too much money for their kids to qualify for student loans that don\u2019t pay for their kids education are pathetic.", "NTA. How are you undermining them? Unless they were going to use a promise of providing money to control his behavior, you giving him money doesn't affect him or their relationship at all. Either they want to control him with money, or they feel embarrassed that you can provide for him where they refuse.", "It's not your responsibility. You are a saint. NTA!!!!", "NTA.  Your parents are really selfish.", " \n\nDon't let your parents blame you for their failures because parenting shifts to you.", "Not that I don't disagree with you, but just wanted to point out that, the OP and her brother live in the UK, more specifically somehwere in england where tuition fee loans are provided by the government and only repayed once earning over x amount. So, for OP's brother starting this year, the threshold will be \u00a325,000 and it's about 9% of the income over the threshold.\n\nSo let's say they earn 30k, it's 9% of 5k per year.\n\nThe money that OP is talking about is for living costs. The UK does also provide maintenance loans for living expenses, on the same basis as the tuition fee loans, but the amount they provide hasn't increased in many years and won't cover costs of rent, food, books, etc. As such, many students need increased support from family even if they have part time jobs, as unlike in the US, private loans aren't generally available.", "Me too!  I had to go back and reread the title because my brain automatically put the \"not\" in there.  OP is absolutely NTA, as is her brother.  But those parents....geesh", "It's simple. Your money, your decision on how to spend it. They have no choice in the matter. The end. NTA, and also, good on you for giving your brother such a great example of selflessness and generosity. Who knows... He might pay it forward someday too. You've just shown him how much you love him.\nParents are tricky. Idk if they are just ignorant, or TA. I know my husband grew up in the UK, and there is not nearly as much pressure to do higher education than here in the states. There is a bit of a culture difference. So if parents felt like their son would do better getting a job right out of school, (especially if all they saw were failing grades), they may have been looking to what they throught was in his best interest. Hard to say.", "Like crabs in a bucket."]}
