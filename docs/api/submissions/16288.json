I\u2019m extremely proud of him. All of them would require him moving quite far and while he won\u2019t have to worry about his tuition fees, he will only be eligible for the minimum amount as our parents earn over the limit. \n\nMy parents refused to help me for my university at all as they\u2019re extremely traditional and don\u2019t think women should go to university, so they made it clear I\u2019d be on my own. So I worked through my undergraduate degree, my masters and now my PhD. I didn\u2019t know when George was born whether they\u2019d pay but when he hit high school they started saving. It didn\u2019t last long though, my brother didn\u2019t do all that well in the first few years and his practice exams didn\u2019t go well at all in 4th year, but our parents have always told him he was \u2018fine but not smart\u2019 and so I think that got in his head a bit. When he failed his practice exams, they spent the money on an expensive holiday abroad (which neither of us were invited to). George confided in me his ambitions and that he really wanted to go to university so I helped him study. He worked hard and did well enough to be able to take the classes the course he wanted to do asked for and I\u2019ve been helping him when he needs it, but it\u2019s mostly just been reassurance that he\u2019s doing a good job and I\u2019m proud of him regardless of what happens. I started saving the second he confided in me he wanted to go. It\u2019s not much since I have my own tuition and stuff to pay for, but it\u2019s enough to match the amount he\u2019ll get on his student loan for first year (about 7k). \n\nHe\u2019s waiting for his final result but he\u2019s pretty sure he\u2019s going to one specific university, which is the same university I went to for my undergraduate degree and therefore I know that without parental help he\u2019ll be screwed and so I will continue to save and help out where I can. Our parents walked in on me explaining to George the terms of him getting access to this money -I\u2019ll transfer him a specific amount every month he\u2019s at uni on the 1st of the month, but any big deductions like textbooks I\u2019ll pay for directly and deduct that from the monthly amount. (I\u2019m just trying to make sure he doesn\u2019t do the classic blow it all in one go). My parents blew up and said I\u2019d overstepped, that I undermined them and was absolutely out of line and it\u2019s not my responsibility. I agreed and told them it wasn\u2019t, but if they\u2019d been responsible and had believed in them I wouldn\u2019t have to. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong but I also feel extremely guilty.

This is mind boggling. You're an amazing sibling, certainly NTA, even slightly.", "Let me get this straight,\n\nThey not only didn't help your bother but also disincentive him, and now are mad that you are helping him instead of them doing it??\n\nNTA, they are not mad that you are doing this, they are mad you are making them look bad. The would prefer your brother not going to university instead of looking like they didn't help.", "Not the asshole, your parents suck, and I am glad that you helped your brother. Sorry about your parents acting misogynistic, because everyone has the right to study.", "NTA, but your parents are for spending the money saved for Uni on a vacation for themselves.  That says it all IMO.  Now they feel guilty and shamed because you've stepped up where they blew him off. They are unable to deal with those feelings and have turned it onto you for making them feel that way. You are a great sister.", "NTA. Good on you for your own studies and for supporting your brother! Also, I think calling your parents \"traditional\" is being very generous to them.", "NTA.  I wonder if your parents wanted to send anyone to university.  They don\u2019t pay for you as you are female then don\u2019t pay for your brother for \u2026 some reason.  I think they wanted to party with the money all along.  And it\u2019s their money I guess, but it seems they want to pretend they had other intentions", "NTA, your parents suck. You do you, in the end he will thank you 0and not them.", "Definitely NTA . Your parents on the other hand are aholes because 1) they saved for your brothers Uni but not yours. I get it old fashioned but still get them a chance and 2) they did save for your brother but then suddenly lost all hope in him to do well? Uhh ok. 3) why are they getting mad at you when clearly you are doing the right thing and helping your brother in life and they caused this whole kerfuffle by spending the money they saved for him. That is then causing you to spend your money because you actually care for him and believe in him.", "NTA, you are a fantastic sibling to help give your brother support you never had instead of making him be in the same position. Your  parent suck! They blew his money because they didn't believe in him, you gave him the confidence to pass and get to where he wanted, no they are mad because you get to play hero when they should have in their eyes, i'm sorry your parent weren't there to support you or your brother, so well done on being a parent he deserves", "Definitely NTA. Your parents are clearly angered because you're helping your brother out, and they're not, because they spent it all. I don't want to make judgements of character but the way your parents have behaved towards your brother and ESPECIALLY you (with the whole not thinking women should study thing) is very, very messed up. Hope you're both doing well.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You have nothing to feel guilty about, you\u2019re doing a wonderful thing emotionally and financially helping your brother where your parents failed him.

Doctoral programs are brutal and costly, and you are doing it on your own.  Your parents failed you and your brother, and you are acting more adult than they are.  \n\nDon't feel guilty - you are giving your brother a chance at a better circumstance.", "You're lovely. Well done on being an amazing big sister. Absolutely NTA. They're just mad because you showed them up.", "NTA. Everyone should be so fortunate to have a sister like you!", "Yes. I understand they feel/look bad and I probably could have worded it better and not snapped at them in front of my brother. I do feel bad, they have a lot of shortcomings as parents but I know that they love us somewhere deep down, but I don\u2019t think that that excuses their behaviour.", "Traditional was the kindest way I could think of to word it, they admittedly have a lot of shortcomings.", "I\u2019m not sure. I was always aware I\u2019d be on my own for university but it seemed for while that they really genuinely thought about George, although they\u2019ve always told him he\u2019s not academically gifted and so he stopped trying but it seems like they just decided he\u2019s stupid (he\u2019s not). Neither of them went to university and part of me wonders if they resent us for that.", "I'm not gonna dictate how you have a relationship with your fam and how you feel about them, but I think you are giving them too much credit, I would have cut them out long ago where I you, add to that how they started to treat your brother and how happy they were to easily give up on him and go spending that money on themselves, all I see is someone more concerned with appereances than their own kids."]}
