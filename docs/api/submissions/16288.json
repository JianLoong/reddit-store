It didn\u2019t last long though, my brother didn\u2019t do all that well in the first few years and his practice exams didn\u2019t go well at all in 4th year, but our parents have always told him he was \u2018fine but not smart\u2019 and so I think that got in his head a bit. When he failed his practice exams, they spent the money on an expensive holiday abroad (which neither of us were invited to). George confided in me his ambitions and that he really wanted to go to university so I helped him study. He worked hard and did well enough to be able to take the classes the course he wanted to do asked for and I\u2019ve been helping him when he needs it, but it\u2019s mostly just been reassurance that he\u2019s doing a good job and I\u2019m proud of him regardless of what happens. I started saving the second he confided in me he wanted to go.

Our parents walked in on me explaining to George the terms of him getting access to this money -I\u2019ll transfer him a specific amount every month he\u2019s at uni on the 1st of the month, but any big deductions like textbooks I\u2019ll pay for directly and deduct that from the monthly amount. (I\u2019m just trying to make sure he doesn\u2019t do the classic blow it all in one go). My parents blew up and said I\u2019d overstepped, that I undermined them and was absolutely out of line and it\u2019s not my responsibility.

I understand they feel/look bad and I probably could have worded it better and not snapped at them in front of my brother.

There is no indication that they were reticent about expressing their beliefs re women and education, so all in their circle already know that OP got through a doctoral program without their help.

You are still giving them the benefit of the doubt. I never did my mother which eventually led to her getting much needed help but my situation was different. One thing that wasn\u2019t was that she only gave me conditional support in college (not monetary because she didn\u2019t have it to give) and even that she ended up conceding she was wrong about me. Hopefully your parents will realize that about your brother. I struggled in high school but not so much in college. I think your brother will be the same.

How are you undermining them? Unless they were going to use a promise of providing money to control his behavior, you giving him money doesn't affect him or their relationship at all.

Your parents are really selfish.", "[removed]", "Not that I don't disagree with you, but just wanted to point out that, the OP and her brother live in the UK, more specifically somehwere in england where tuition fee loans are provided by the government and only repayed once earning over x amount. So, for OP's brother starting this year, the threshold will be \u00a325,000 and it's about 9% of the income over the threshold.\n\nSo let's say they earn 30k, it's 9% of 5k per year.\n\nThe money that OP is talking about is for living costs. The UK does also provide maintenance loans for living expenses, on the same basis as the tuition fee loans, but the amount they provide hasn't increased in many years and won't cover costs of rent, food, books, etc. As such, many students need increased support from family even if they have part time jobs, as unlike in the US, private loans aren't generally available.", "Me too!  I had to go back and reread the title because my brain automatically put the \"not\" in there.  OP is absolutely NTA, as is her brother.  But those parents....geesh", "It's simple. Your money, your decision on how to spend it. They have no choice in the matter. The end. NTA, and also, good on you for giving your brother such a great example of selflessness and generosity. Who knows... He might pay it forward someday too. You've just shown him how much you love him.\nParents are tricky. Idk if they are just ignorant, or TA. I know my husband grew up in the UK, and there is not nearly as much pressure to do higher education than here in the states. There is a bit of a culture difference. So if parents felt like their son would do better getting a job right out of school, (especially if all they saw were failing grades), they may have been looking to what they throught was in his best interest. Hard to say.", "Like crabs in a bucket.", "Christ your parents suck. You\u2019re completely NTA here - in fact, you\u2019re incredible.

Are they mad because you made them look bad?\n\nYour parents are the AH here", "NTA. It sounds like they want his socioeconomic wings clipped so he'll be more dependent upon them in the future, so then they can turn it back on him as some sort of debt he owes them so he'll take care of them in old age.

Do you need a Yankee sister?", "NTA. Your parents are just not liking that you made them look and probably feel bad for two times.

If you can help him out and are willing to do so in a way that helps him learn to budget at uni then I see nothing wrong with it.

I didn't work while I was studying in uni but I worked constantly over summer/winter/Halloween/Easter breaks and saved the money for when I was at uni so I wouldn't be living off cheap b&m noodles for the whole term\n\nPOSITIVE SIDE NOTE: Well done to you working towards your PhD! Congrats to your brother as well on the uni offers and good luck to him for his results!", "NTA - I work at a UK University in Financial Support. The maximum maintenance loan might just about cover needs, but anyone below that would realistically need help from family.

And parents who can but won't help is always heartbreaking.", "NTA", "You're NTA, but your parents are sort of right, your brother is not a child. He needs to find a job to pay for things himself instead of leeching off his own sister.", "I can see this in the UK, well scotland, basically noone in my family or anyone I really knew growing up went to uni. There's a weird lower & working class attitude that you're thinking to highly of yourself if you go to uni. I'm guessing parents are working class,l based on the post, though that's an assumption. \n\nI'm not blasting lower & working class BTW, but having grown up on a scheme, where very little of my family worked, one big social mobility issues is this 'know your place' attitude.", "I didn\u2019t have completely nothing, I\u2019m just now realising that my post made it seem that way. I had the minimum student loan amount (which I\u2019m still paying back, unfortunately) which wasn\u2019t enough to cover even half of my student accommodation so I worked full time through both my undergraduate degree and my MSc, and now my PhD. But yes I started saving when he told me he wanted to go and helping him with his studies.", "I think they assumed I\u2019d stay with them or get a part time job until I found a man to move in with and have kids (I am a lesbian). I think they assumed my brother would go to uni until they decided he wasn\u2019t smart enough and so they pushed him heavily towards sports so I guess a football player?", "It\u2019s possible that they were waiting for him to accept a place before discussing money but it never really occurred to me tbh. I didn\u2019t ask, and I just assumed they weren\u2019t. Whatever they may have set aside, if anything, definitely isn\u2019t going to him now I tried discussing it with them but they seem to be punishing both of us for my actions.", "Yes, but I think they also think I undermined them and their authority as parents and that I crossed that line.", "You worked full time while going to university and you helped your brother and made sure he was okay and even saved up money for him although you don\u00b4t have much money yourself. You are amazing. I really hope you know that. Not to mention how it must have additionally taken a toll on you to have such complicated parents. I really hope that you will live the happiest life one day", "Christ your parents sound even worse now I'm sorry. If your parents thought your bro wasn't smart enough for uni (which I find hard to believe is the case, you don't need to be a genius to get into uni and I'm sure your brother is alright) I'm surprised they didn't consider an apprenticeship or a more vocational course at a college instead of a very unreliable solution which goes off the assumption that your brother is talented enough to make a decent living off sport. You sound like a fantastic sister and am happy for both of you!", "We\u2019re actually Scottish so it\u2019s slightly different more or less, yeah. We\u2019re Scottish but his top choices, which is also where I went to uni too, are in England so it\u2019s slightly different and the Scottish maintenance loan (and I think probably all of the other loans) won\u2019t make much of a dent in his living costs, but even if he was going to uni here it probably wouldn\u2019t still be enough without our parents contributing.", "Does that mean your parents plan to give your brother the necessary funds?", "They're probably upset that you, a *female*, have more funds to give your brother than they do and they are embarrassed.\n\nYou're a good sister, OP.", "I won\u2019t lie I did consider it a few times but I love my brother and I didn\u2019t want him to have to be with them alone so as long as he\u2019s in contact with them I will be too.", "I hope they realise they\u2019re wrong too. My brother is intelligent, but his biggest obstacle is confidence and self-belief. He\u2019s been told he was stupid frequently since he was 10 and I tried my best to let him know that that\u2019s not true but the opinion of the parents matters so much more when you\u2019re young. I think he just assumed they were right, but they\u2019re not.", "I envy you guys up there, but at the same time, I recognise that I was lucky. I was the last year to have the low tuition fees, but I also had the maintenance grant. My year was also the last to have EMA in college in England.\n\nBut even so, the killer is the fact that maintenance loans haven't increased in years, even in Scotland. Especially as they still base on household income even though some parents either refuse to help or can't afford to help. \u00a36k at the low end or \u00a38k max, neither is enough to live off in a year, considering that has to pay for everything", "There's your issue there. \n\nFellow scot here, there's a rampant attitude of 'know your place' up here.

We need to shed that shitty stay in your lane attitude up here that prevents social mobility. I hope your brother has an awesome time at uni.", "Absolutely! the maintenance loans all over the UK are shocking. They don\u2019t maintain anything. They\u2019ll probably cover most of his student accommodation bills but not all of them and that\u2019s pretty much it.", "It definitely is a thing I think, particularly of people of a certain age or particularly religious folk. My parents are definitely of that ilk, unfortunately. \n\nHis first choice is a prominent one yeah.

He's 17 and will be going to university shortly. You're Scottish. He could have legally moved out last year. \n\nThey can go off on another f our children vacation and stay there. Not Spain though. Spain deserves better. What's going on? Now they can't constantly threaten and belittle him? My heart breaks for them. \n\nThey're assholes. Cut them off after your brother is out of the house. Make sure he stays out of that house too! Calling him stupid since he was ten!!! What assholes.", "NTA but have you checked if the university, charities or the local authority have any grants or financial support available for your brother? My university had a scholarship thing (didn't have to pay it back) depending on your circumstances\n\nI would also advise maybe looking into private renting instead of student accommodation if you haven't already done so - only out of personal experience, as I found it to just be a money sinkhole whereas private seems a lot cheaper and more comfortable, although it might be different depending on where he's going though\n\nTo be honest I feel for you, I've known people in similar situations that had to scrape by in uni too. Wishing you both the best xx", "I may be wrong but I get a vibe from the parents of  \u201cyou think you\u2019re better than me?\u201d regarding both OP and her brother. I had a friend (now deceased) with those parents\u2014they both said that he would amount to nothing and that they would actively disown him if he went to college, which he was plenty smart enough to do. He ended up becoming a serially unemployed blackout alcoholic who died in his fifties. At least he wasn\u2019t better than them, in their minds.", "It depends. If your brother is studying something worthwhile aka positive ROI then you are doing him a solid by helping him out. If he's going there to study something with poor or negative ROI then YTA to yourself as you are seeing yourself on fire to keep him warm as you yourself have loans to pay and the money you will give him could go towards paying your debt", "It wasn\u2019t your responsibility but IT WAS YOUR RIGHT!!  This story has me blinking tears\u2026 you are an amazing, smart, strong and capable young woman.  You worked your tail off and earned your PhD without family support!!  And as a SISTER oh my goodness, you bring so much joy to this mother\u2019s heart.  Truly\u2026 I have seven kids of my own and if they grow up to be half the sibling you were to do this\u2026. \ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\udc93\n\nWhatever the complete 180 polar opposite of \u201cYTA\u201d is what you are.  NTA by itself is insufficient.  Your parents should be ashamed of themselves!!  Didn\u2019t believe in either one of their kids AND THEN SQUANDERED THE SAVINGS they at one time thought your brother deserved\u2026. Your brother needed someone to believe in him and you did so much more!!  \n\nI\u2019m a huge sap \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude48  But truly it was an HONOR for me to read this story!  I\u2019m wishing your brother all the success in the world.\n\nPS \u2014 The petty side of me would require your parents to call you DR. They should call your bro DR too, if he ends up getting HIS PhD someday.  \ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c\ud83d\ude1c", "You did undermine them, in the best way possible, by being the parent to your brother that they should have been. They\u2019re more than welcome to pay instead of you if they want to earn their respect back l.", "NTA. You\u2019ve given him needed help your parents haven\u2019t offered, which is amazing. But be careful that you are supporting his growth and not subsidizing his lifestyle if he doesn\u2019t live up to his end of the bargain. Some people need more support than others, but make sure he\u2019s not only clear about how to get the money but what the conditions are to continue to get it (whatever that may be\u2014academic performance, completing his classes on time, getting help if he struggles with a subject, etc.).", "NTA you are an amazing sibling and your brother is very lucky. I\u2019m sorry your parents don\u2019t feel the same way.", "NTA. It\u2019s very nice and kind of you to help your younger brother.", "He probably will get at least a part time job, but I honestly want him to be able to actually enjoy himself particularly in first year. I struggled even with a full time job, I was burnt out in my first couple of months and was facing getting kicked out of student accommodation even with my job and maintenance loan because I could barely afford all of my bills and had to pick and choose, my grades weren\u2019t as good as they good have been bc I simply did not have the time to dedicate to studying much outside of class. It was hellish and I don\u2019t want him to suffer the way I did. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ll provide for him forever obviously, but he deserves to not have to struggle to survive. None of us deserve to have to struggle to survive regardless of how old we are.", "It\u2019s Sir Terry\u2019s Crab Bucket, no one wants to be in the bucket, but the second you try to climb out of the bucket the rest just pull you back down.", ">I know that they love us somewhere deep down\n\nLove means nothing if it does not bring with it kindness, charity, devotion, and joy. Nothing excuses this behavior. \n\nWhy do you feel bad? They deserve you snapping. They deserve a lot worse and this is not their decision! It is between you and your brother.", "I appreciate your response and that certainly clarifies things. Here in the USA college can basically be out of reach for millions of young adults if their parents don't at least cosign for a loan.", "I get it, you want to be a good sister. That is very noble of you. However, you really shouldn't set yourself on fire to keep others warm.", "I\u2019m not entirely sure if I\u2019m honest. It\u2019s possible but unlikely they were simply waiting for him to pick a school before discussing it with him but it didn\u2019t occur to me to ask because I kind of assumed they hadn\u2019t, based on what happened the last time they saved and their general \u2018he\u2019s not smart enough\u2019 attitude.", "Hopefully your support shows him what he truly is. Obviously your very smart or you wouldn\u2019t be able to handle a PhD program and hopefully he realizes that you\u2019re too smart to encourage him to do something he\u2019s not capable of!"]}
