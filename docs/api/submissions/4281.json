English is not my first language so please be nice.\n\nSome context: I (42M) am a single father of three kids (16F, 14M, 10M). I also like to make things, especially clothes and anything that let's me sew. I've made a lot of clothes for my kids, especially my daughter (who I'll refer to as Sara from here on). Every dress she owns I have at least altered if not made entirely. We have a tradition where I'll make her a dress for special occasions (e.g. her birthday/Christmas, getting good grades, weddings). S owns a lot of dresses at this point.\n\nThe issue started back in June when I asked Sara to go through old dresses and tell me which ones don't fit, have tears/other damage, and which ones she doesn't want anymore. I was shocked when I found the dress I made for my sister's wedding in the get-rid-of box. She wore it for the two weeks before the wedding everyday. It wasn't damaged and in really good condition, which was not a shock since she takes very good care of her clothes. I asked her if she really wanted to get rid of it, as I could try and make it fit her still since it wasn't that small on her. But she said she didn't want it anymore.\n\nI couldn't in good conscious throw it away, and selling something that had such happy memories seemed like a waste. So I asked around in my family if anyone wanted it, but no one was interested. While trying to figure out what to do with the dress my sister and niece came to visit. My niece fell in love with the fabric of the dress, saying how pretty it looked and all that. So, I decided I'd make her a teddy bear with the fabric and give it to her as a birthday present.\n\nFast forward to this Monday at my nieces party. The gift opening starts and my niece picks my gift and reveals the teddy bear. My niece loved it but when I looked at my Sara's face she looked angry. Sara pulled me aside and asked how could I turn her dress into a stuffed animal. I asked what she meant, she told me to get rid of it. She assumed I would've just sold the dress or given it to a family member. I tried to explain but Sara wasn't having it. She said I destroyed the dress and she was hurt that I'd do that.\n\nI talked with some of my seamstress friends and they're mostly split, saying I either did a good job reusing fabric to make something special for my niece or that I'm a prick for destroying something sentimental of Sara's. My family is mostly on my side, but my mother says I was insensitive to Sara's feelings.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670525204, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg7k06/aita_for_using_my_daughters_old_dress_to_make_a/", "score": 95, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was *willing to throw it away*. It can't have been that sentimental to her, if she didn't care where it ended up.\n\nThis is a learning experience for her. Definitely not TA in any way, shape, or form.", "NTA. \n\nYour daughter made it clear that she did not want the dress anymore. What you did was a sweet gesture for your niece.", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t want it.  She doesn\u2019t get to complain about whatever happened to it once she decided she wasn\u2019t keeping it.", "NTA, your daughter didn't want it, and you asked her to make sure. She is only 16 so it is quite understandable but I'm afraid to say she needs to learn to grow up a bit.\n\nAlso I think that's a lovely way to give new life to unwanted clothing, I'm sure your niece will treasure it for many years", "NTA She said she didn't want it. You believed her. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. She asked you to get rid of the dress. What's it to her the format it will be in. Would have been worse for you to throw it out. At least now the materials have been recycled.", "NTA \n\nShe told you to get rid of it. No one wanted the dress as is - and you made something special out of it. I think you did something fantastic. Your daughter is probably just mad that she didn't think of something similar. Have you ever made her something else out of a piece she loved? Maybe you could offer to maker her a new piece using some of the old fabric.", "NTA\n\nS said to give it away, once you give it away it\u2019s not up to you what to do with it. If you sold it to someone they could have used it to make an outfit for their dog or wash their car with it. \nYou make a nice gift for your niece and hopefully she\u2019ll enjoy it for years to come.", "NAH - Your intentions were good, but you probably should have asked her if she minded you destroying it. It could also be that she never considered the dress's fabric could be used for something else, and she might have realized she wanted to keep a part of it herself. If I were you, I'd take the scraps and make her a mini Teddy bear and apologize for hurting her feelings. There's a difference between anger and hurt, and the latter requires a little extra love.", "NTA ... seems like a good use of the dress considering she was ready to get rid of it. I feel like there's something else going on there with S.", "NTA - as far as she let you know, she had 0 interest in keeping the dress. She is the one who put it in the toss pile. You just repurposed it.", "NTA she didn't want it. So she shouldn't care about what happened to it.", "NTA but...i think i might know where the communication went awry. If she thought 'get rid of' meant donate, as in someone else could use and love that dress as you made it  and it would find a better purpose than in her closet and then it was just destroyed for parts i can see where she might be bothered. If for you 'get rid of' simply meant 'she doesn't want it and i could throw it away.' then this is where you miscommunicated. Either way neither side is the asshole. You interpreted it one way and she interpreted it another and it was a misunderstanding. \n\nI say this because my mother and i had a similar one years ago with an old stuffed animal of mine. I didn't want it as I'm 39 now and had no use for it but it was sentimental and i wanted it to go to a kid who would love it as much as I did. She thought that meant i just didn't care what happened to it and...gave it to the dog to chew on. It was destroyed and i was heartbroken. In her case she purposely ignored that i told her I wanted it donated. In your case it sounds like miscommunication.", "NTA\n\nShe tossed the dress into the get rid of it pile. You even double checked with her. \n\nWhatever emotions she\u2019s feeling are valid of course and it doesn\u2019t sound like she made a scene so she\u2019s not an AH either. But she maybe needs to process things a little differently and be more explicit about her expectations at 16. She probably got taken for surprise when she saw that and didn\u2019t know how to handle it well as she\u2019s still a kid. \n\nBut you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NAH because it sounds like a miscommunication. Some people are okay passing a dress/piece of clothing on but not okay with it being repurposed. \n\nA loved one did a similar thing by asking me for my old t-shirts and then surprising me with a keepsake quilt. As a teenager I lacked the vocabulary to express why the gesture bothered me. I would have been fine donating or seeing younger cousins in the shirts but to me the sentimentality was tied to its wearability - passing down something I enjoyed to someone who would enjoy it in the same way. My loved one saw the sentimentality in the fabric and not in its functionality. \n\nOver time I grew to appreciate the gift because it came from a place of love even if it wasn\u2019t my ideal way of expressing it.\n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be okay with time and this is just her immediate reaction. I\u2019m sure seeing how happy her is will help.", "NTA. \n\nI'd forgive S, of course, but she's acting very immature. She decided she didn't want the dress, you even double checked to be certain. You took the very reasonable position of reusing it.\n\nI have to wonder if anything else is going on with S. Could just be going through a phase of wanting to put her childhood behind her, but not really realizing that she's still attached to parts of it (and that there's nothing wrong with that)? It definitely doesn't seem like it's really about the dress...", "NTA - she wanted to get rid of the dress\u2026 she\u2019s being petty and to me it looks personal between her and the other kid.", "NTA she put it in the get rid box and you actually made really good use of it. S should have communicated better, this isn't on you.", "Nta, the daughter should have never put the dress in that box if it meant so much to her", "If the dress was sentimental to S, then she shouldn't have told you to get rid of it; so your seamstress friends who said that are just plain wrong.  \n\n\nI think what you did was creative, and an excellent way to turn something old *and unwanted* into something new. You made sure S didn't want it anymore before you did anything. She's being indecisive at best, and a \"dog in the manger\" at worst. NTA.", "NTA. S wanted to get rid of the dress, so she has no say over what you do with it next. It's a great idea to take something sentimental and repurpose it to keep it in the family. I don't understand why she can't see that, if she was okay with your just giving the dress to another family member.", "NTA. She said she didn\u2019t want it. \n\nApologize and say you didn\u2019t know.", "NTA. It couldn't have been too sentimental as she told you to get rid of it. I think she is just jealous that she didn't get it made into a bear.", "NTA- Kids can be so hard to understand\u2026.is there any fabric from the dress left to make your daughter a stuffed keepsake? Maybe a little pillow for her bed\u2026", "NTA. Is there enough fabric left to make S a little teddy bear, or mouse, or somesuch? I think that would take away the sting.", "NTA.\n\nYou asked her again if she wanted to keep the dress when she put in the throw out pile. When she said no, it was no longer her decision what happened to it.\n\nAnd reusing fabric is entirely a good thing. People make memory bears all the time from old clothing from loved ones in rememberance.remembrance.\n\nDaughter comes across as selfish. If it was sentimental, she should have kept it.", "INFO: This whole thing seems like a big miscommunication. She took your offer as \"I can alter your wedding dress so you can wear it daily\" and said no, because she has no desire to wear a wedding dress again. You took this as \"destroy the dress\", when she meant it as \"you can have it to give to somebody else.\" Is that possible?", "NAH.\n\nShe assumed one thing and you assumed another.\n\nClearer communications of both of your intentions would have helped here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have created something beautiful that your niece will cherish for a long time from something sentimental to you, which your daughter was willing to give away. Plus, if it was for the daughter of sister whose wedding the dress was worn to, it makes that bear even more special and appropriate. There are businesses who create Teddy from clothes worn by loved one, and I think it is a beautiful things, because those are not just pieces of fabric, they are memories and should be cherished.

Thats the best way when possible to deal with clothing", "Yes, it's a learning experience, but it's not that cut and dried that she was willing to give it away, so she doesn't care. She recognizes that she can't hoard clothes that no longer fit.\n\nIf the dress was sold or given to a relative, there is the thought that the pretty dress will be worn and someone else will enjoy the dress. She imagines someone wearing it and treating it as she did. Now that she actually sees that did not happen it's a disappointment. \n\nIf I had a sentimental childhood toy I gave to someone, I would be upset if they ended up repurposing it and not treasuring it.
