But now it felt like we never spent time as brothers, especially me and James, and that sharing a room they would have expected more from us. My parents said they wanted us to all be totally open and honest about how we felt and to express if we had any issues with the family to get out of the way. They said they weren't going to take a turn until after the three of us spoke first. And we couldn't leave until we opened up and said everything.\n\nI told them I felt like they had somewhat unrealistic goals, that they ignored some stuff that had been mentioned to them in the past that would have made the lack of closeness less of a surprise, and that it was weird for them to pretend they had no idea of anything going on.\n\nI admitted that I hate sharing a room with James. That personality wise, he and I clash, and that he relies too much on being the younger brother and getting his own way, which annoys me. I said I had told them this before. James will set up these sleepover nights for him and me on the floor and he'll expect me to play football outside with him until it's close to midnight and then go in and watch movies that bore me to tears and sleep in our sleeping bags instead of our beds. I said he started insisting we do things he enjoys when we were like 8 and 10 and ever since that point hanging out with him has not been fun for me, it has not made me feel closer to him. I admitted that I would rather share with Easton. I also said I had brought this stuff to my parents attention before. And even complained when he was messing up my side of the room and left me to clean up, which my parents expected me to do instead of him. I also mentioned that I hate hanging out with his friends who I have nothing in common with.\n\nI told my parents they overlook James being mean to Easton. That it might be due to jealousy and resentment that I'm closer to Easton or it might be due to Easton being the youngest. But they would never let me say to James what James can say to Easton.\n\nI also said they treat us like we're little kids. They will tell us to go hang with much younger kids and do their activities at family houses and they'll tell us no video games until we play outside. And that even after 16 years of knowing me, they still can't accept that I don't like sports and it's not my idea of fun to kick a ball or run around and it never has been.\n\nJames was upset about the stuff I said about him.

Your parents got exactly what they asked for, they just wanted to hear something completely different. Your parents didn't think this through, that getting real feedback would mean someone's feelings got hurt (probably multiple someones) and changes would have to be made to how they do things. This ain't on you. \n\nMost of the time when people say \"I just want someone to be honest about how they feel\" they do not like what they hear because what they want to hear is supposed to justify their inner narrative and someone else's feelings rarely do that.

You handled this with far more maturity (honesty, but no personal digs or insults) than many adults would've done so, of which I applaud you for doing so.\n\nIt sounds to me that none of you brothers were particularly fussed with the closeness situation, but your parents created a situation that wasn't really a problem, and have now opened Pandora's Box where honesty is concerned and now regret it and wish to put the contents back.\n\nYour parents basically punishing you for being honest really is setting them up for parental failure, because now they have been counter-productive and made you feel like you cannot be open and honest with them in the future. Easton has seen you defend him to your parents, and will know that his eldest brother has his back, but his parents will continue to allow James to bully him, and learn that he can never be honest with yours and his parents either. Meanwhile, James will continue to be the golden child, and now will use your honesty against you, and weaponise your words to be portrayed as a non-existent victim.\n\nIs it at all possible for you to have your own room in the house, going forward? It might actually help with your relationship with James for you to have your own room, your own space and privacy, so that you don't end up resenting him, and he can learn to be his own separate entity too. If you moved into a room with Easton, it may further fuel James' behaviours and he'll only start telling your parents that his two brothers have turned against him, which you do not want either.", "Hang in there, man.

But it could be a good thing that it is open, if they let it be.\n\nAside from how your parents have reacted, which I don't agree with at all, I see this as a lack of observing personality differences. I am an introverted person and I like a lot of alone time, and regardless of how much I liked someone, I would not like the situation you've described with your brother, where they want to be spend hour after hour, activity after activity, with me. That's putting aside the preferences you have of how you want to spend your time, and putting aside the entitled aspect of insisting you spend time in ways you don't want to. The core element, or an important element, is that people are just different. And they are pathologising your simple preferences. It doesn't sound like you said anything insulting or that you got too personal (though it's hard to avoid hurting people when you're radically honest, but again, they opened up that can of worms).\n\nYou're allowed to have your preferences and your own personality.\n\nDon't ever let them make you feel you're wrong to have preferences.", "NTA.

After he was diagnosed with a learning disability as a kid, his parents began thinking of him as handicapped and a bit helpless. (which is quite an exaggeration of the issues he does have. He's dyslexic and has mild ADHD and some sensory issues) And they still think of him as helpless and unable to do things normally. Even things that have **nothing** to do with his actual learning disability. Like driving. They literally wanted him to never learn to drive a car because they heard dyslexia can cause left/right confusion and they decided this would cause him to turn left into oncoming traffic and kill himself one day when trying to turn right.\n\nBut part of their self image is tied up in the idea of having a \"handicapped child\" (their words, not mine) to the point they are in some ways unable to accept he's a grown adult and doesn't need someone to take care of him the way they think he needs. It's darkly funny that they have gotten angry at me for not babying him in those ways. But I actually have the same learning disabilities he does!", "10 years later: My kids won't speak to me and I don't understand why.", "NC= no contact", "Then Hal forgets he had a pizza in the oven and the house is on fire.", "I kept thinking about \"missing missing reasons\" when OP was saying how his parents reacted to the truth he told them. \n\nThey're never going to get it.\n\nEdit to add link in case OP finds this comment and wants to read the essay [Missing missing reasons ](https://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/missing-missing-reasons.html)", "Not in the US", "I am So sorry that this is your situation. Think we\u2019ve reached the point of trying to involve an outside adult. An aunt or uncle school counselor. If your parents have you so isolated that none of those things are possible this is a bigger problem and we can work on that too.", "My first instinct was maybe Easton and you can share a room. But since Easton knows the joys of having a room to yourself he might not like sharing a room...\n\nHow IS your bond with Easton? You said you like him better than James. Do you have hobbies in common? Maybe socializing with Easton at times will give you a break from James, as James sounds exhausting by the way.\n\nHow did James and Easton fare in your parents forced family talk by the way?\n\nEdit: changed word.", "What about Easton and James sharing? Would that be an absolute disaster? Logically as teens makes more sense for the eldest to have the solo room and younger two share", "In my experience, the oldest got their own room, if there were enough rooms.", "Is this in another comment thread?
