I don't say that to be mean, it's just a fact.  If we were going to go see a movie, if we were lucky we'd be leaving the popcorn line as the previews were starting.  She showed up 15 minutes late for *our wedding* for Odin's sake.\n\nAt the time, we had a regular \"game night\" at my friend Rob's place.  Rob lived about an hour and a half from where we were living at the time, so if game night was supposed to start at 4 in the afternoon we needed to be on the road by 2:30 to get there on time.  She never expressed any desire to stay home from game night, and I never forced her to come with me.  She seemed to have fun on those nights, playing D&D or Shadowrun, or Cards Against Humanity or whatever else we happened to be playing those nights.  But, if game night started at 4, we'd almost always get there between 4:30 and 5 because she couldn't get ready to leave in time.  I was raised to believe that \"Early is on time, on time is late, and it's better to be an hour early than a minute late\".  \n\nI would mention that her making us late all the time stressed me out and she'd just shrug her shoulders and say \"Sorry\".  I wouldn't berate her about it in front of everyone, but I'd bring it up in the car on the drive home.\n\nThe situation that I may have been the asshole:\n\nAfter about 3 months of always being late to game night I told her flat out \"We've got to leave at 2:30 to get there on time.  I'm leaving at 2:30 regardless of if you're ready or not.\"  2:15 rolled around and she's just now getting in the shower.  I've been ready to go for about half an hour at that point.  At 2:30 I got in my car and headed to Rob's place.  About 3:15, when I'm halfway there my phone starts ringing.  It's her.  She wants to know where I am.  I tell her I'm on I-81.  She starts yelling about me abandoning her and how she was looking forward to game night and how I'm an asshole for leaving without her and blah blah blah.  I told her I'd talk to her later and hung up.  She had gone to her parents place at some point before I got home and stayed with them for a week.  Her staying with her parents for a week wasn't uncommon, I'd usually only see her on the weekends.\n\nSo, I ask the gurus of Reddit, was I the asshole for leaving her at home that night?", "created_utc": 1673730094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bzabt/aita_for_leaving_my_wife_at_home/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Make any excuse you want, but always being late, getting in the shower 15 mins before you are supposed to leave, always missing the start of movies or people waiting to eat because \u201cyou\u201d is disrespectful of others\u2019 time and incredibly self centered.  I think they love the attention, knowing everyone is waiting for them.\n\nIt\u2019s worse when they laugh it off or give some BS like \u201cit\u2019s just how we are lol\u201d. Well it\u2019s not funny, and me not waiting for people like you all the time is just how I am.  15 mins then I\u2019m moving on - you aren\u2019t there, too bad.", "NTA \nDon't need to feel guilty over this anymore. Being always late is a lack of respect. And you told her in advance, so...", "NTA\n\nYou told her when you were leaving and left.\n\nI hate people who are always late.", "NTA\n\nI swear, it seems like people who are always late always get hooked up with people that are always on time and it never works out well. \n\nYou warned her. She didn't plan. Too bad.", "I'm sure this will be unpopular, but NTA. This drives me insane when people do this, knowing full well it stresses you out, making zero effort to do anything about it. She knew full well you were leaving at 2:30, and started showering at 2:15 ffs. That's just blatant disrespect every single time. Clearly the conversations you have with her go in one ear and out the other, and she doesn't care at all about how you feel, just shrugging like oops. People like that need to learn the hard way sometimes, and honestly when you're that fed up, you end up doing something like this. You told her when the bus left and that it left with or without her. Not your fault she's a child and doesn't know how to get ready on time.", "NTA. Your wife needs to learn some respect for other peoples time. Why does she often stay at her parents though? Is this tantrums for other things?", "Nta.  Everybody is late to something at some point, so if this was a first time offense my answer would be very different. But, if you are frequently late, you are showing disrespect for others' time.  Sometimes a quick lesson like this will do the trick. Sometimes it won't.", "NTA. I probably would just have drove separately and communicated that before I left.", "NTA - Being late all the time is just so disrespectful. I don't care if someone is neurodivergent even. There are tools and solutions. Sort yourself out.", "NTA In general, I think popping your head into the bathroom to say that you\u2019re leaving would have been more polite (so she\u2019s not looking for you), but I understand the impulse.", "NTA. You told her that if she wasn't ready on time, you were leaving. She wasn't ready on time, so you left. You didn't abandon her. Maybe this experience will be the impetus for her to respect others' time and show up on time for events.", "NTA\n\nYou told her that if she was not ready you are leaving without her and followed on your words , i don't think she has the right to get mad.", "I am almost always late to everything and everyone who knows me knows it. It\u2019s not intentional. I have very bad ADHD and when I\u2019m not on my medications, I tend to get distracted and end up taking longer than usual because I have trouble figuring out exactly what I want to wear or factoring how long it will take. I end up procrastinating at times also because I\u2019m a bit terrible at time management unless I\u2019m at work because I\u2019m on my medications.\n\nHowever, my husband checks in on me to see where my progress is and if I\u2019m ready, and I\u2019m totally fine with that and try my best to rush myself as quick as I possibly can. After all, it\u2019s never his fault that I end up taking longer to get ready to go somewhere, and it\u2019s also never his fault when we are late. It\u2019s mine, and I own up to it, and because we communicate well and he\u2019s very patient with me and I don\u2019t get frustrated with him for trying to let me know we\u2019re pressed for time, he never gets mad and never leaves me behind.\n\nYour ex-wife just sounds like she was flat out inconsiderate. It also sounds like she never cared in the first place. Not to mention, she stayed at her parents\u2019 house often, so you barely ever saw her. Communication wasn\u2019t the only problem you had- she was a terrible wife in the first place.\n\nGood thing you\u2019re no longer together. Sending good vibes your way that someday you find someone who values your time and doesn\u2019t selfishly make you late all the time in the future.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  Yeah, she will be pissed.  But you did the right thing.  It is incredibly disrespectful of her to not just you, but everybody else that she chooses not to be on time.", "NTA.", "NTA \u2014 I'm also a chronically late person (I have adhd and time blindness as a result), but when it's important to be on time, I make the extra effort out of respect. Your (ex)wife wasn't respecting what was important to you. Was there a cultural difference between you two? I know that makes a difference.", "Wife obviously values your and others time less than her own. NTA. \n\nKeep talking, keep expressing your anxiety, your feelings and listen to her responses. If your both as invested as each other a system would be available for enabling both of your needs", "NTA - It was an AH thing to do, but sometimes you have to make a point. If I were the game night host, I would think you two were really rude for always arriving late and I'd probably quit inviting you.", "NTA - I can\u2019t stand people that are perpetually late thinking that it\u2019s fine for others to accommodate them all the time. If you\u2019re going to be disrespectful of others people\u2019s time - then be prepared to face the music when others starts to treat you the same.

It\u2019s also not just you that is upset but I\u2019m sure the others at game night are as well. Your wife isn\u2019t considerate of other people. Maybe try to figure out why she can\u2019t be ready to go on time. Like what is she doing the whole day she can\u2019t be ready?", "NTA, you had another option tho.\nWhen i used to hang out with friends (usually to play soccer), one of them was always late (and he usually lived close to the rendezvous point). At some point we got tired and started to tell him the wrong time (like 30-60 earlier), and he started to arrive in time", "NTA.\n\nNot a close question.", "Looks like you dodged a bullet NTA", "Your wife has no respect for people's time. Obviously words weren't getting the message across, so it makes sense to escalate. Your wife is going to lose relationships because of her behavior, as people usually see it as disrespectful (myself included).\n\nNTA", "NTA- I\u2019ve done this to my mother lots of time. She is terrible for being on time. She stopped doing it when she realises I won\u2019t wait for her anymore. \n\nI\u2019ve gone to a wedding without her and turned up at her house once to take her to my kids\u2019 Christmas concert and left 2 minutes later because she wasn\u2019t leaving until she had her dinner (which she hadn\u2019t started). \n\nAlso If we arranged to meet at restaurants as a family once, we sat down, waited 10 minutes then I make everyone order. By the time she turned up, we\u2019d almost finished the meal. She was livid we hadn\u2019t waited.", "I'm definitely leaning towards NTA, but I'd also be really interested in knowing what is causing the wife to prepare late. \n\nIs she so stressed out for some reason that she forgets?  If that's the case, you might be more of a jerk for not giving her an additional reminder closer to time like someone already suggested. However, at some point the wife also has to take accountability for being late. When it becomes a pattern...it's not a \"sorry\" for being late because it's not an accident. It's not quirky or cute, and it definitely does reflect badly on them both if it is constantly happening. \n\nThat being said, as having a job that requires a lot of backwards time planning, I highly recommend implementing a plan I've seen work for these types of people. If you want them to be on time, then tell them the time by which they are needed to be somewhere is a half hour earlier than what it actually is. If they are deliberately trying to make you late, then it is reverse psychology to get them to places on time.", "There was a guy on AITA who was complaining about his wife always being late. He ended up doing a follow up and decided after reading all the responses that he was not tolerating her lateness anymore. He filed for divorce. The wife and all their friends and family were stunned. The incident where he got fed up was a movie theater. He got them there early and she snatched defeat out of victory and ended up shopping for an hour after he got them there a half hour early.", "NTA.

She is who she is. I think ESH but if you\u2019re exes I guess it all got sorted", "YTA\n\nVery, very poor way to deal with it.  The way you deal with these situations is to set a goal to start getting ready earlier and to set a goal to leave earlier.  That way if you're \"late\" leaving, you still arrive on time.", "YTA - there were a couple of options here, either supporting her to improve time keeping or playing hardball (knowing full well how it would go). You chose the second option, which is your prerogative and understandable given your upbringing, but still makes you an asshat.", "ESH.\n\nThe \"better to be an hour early than a minute late\" mindset is extreme, unless everyone else in the game night friends group was equally punctual.\n\nShe's an AH for being so consistently late, especially when your own mindset was so diametrically opposite. It doesn't sound like she tried to compromise.\n\nYou're an AH for leaving at 2:30 without a word. \"I told you I would leave at 2:30. It is now 2:30. I am leaving,\" would have let her avoid wasting time and effort continuing to get ready. It was also prevent her from looking around to see where you were hiding. You should have behaved like an adult and used words to say you were leaving rather than simply running off.", "I mean, I guess technically NTA. But if this is now your ex-wife and presuming from your post that this was some time ago, why are you now posting this? If you're stewing on events that happened long ago, time to get some therapy.\n\nAlso it's actually pretty normal for brides to be 10 - 15mins late to the wedding. Lots of people do it purposefully so guests arriving late don't disrupt the ceremony.", ">By the way arriving 1 hour early is just as rude as being 1 hour late. You arrive on time\u2026\n\nThank you.

For an hour.", "I'm the same way for the same reason. My husband and I came up with a fix- since he understands time, he'll say, \"hey it's time to start if we're leaving at X o'clock,\" and I say thanks and start getting ready. He understands I don't do it on purpose and I appreciate the heads up!", "There wasn't really a cultural difference between us per se, I just grew up with 2 parents that both had to work so I was taught that punctuality was a virtue and being late for anything was about the worst thing you could do short of killing someone.

OP discussed this with his wife multiple times. She ignored him. Using manipulation tactics to substitute her poor time management skills is silly.

Sometimes the people of Reddit have given me some really helpful suggestions that have really helped me out.", "The adult thing to do is to discuss it with your partner ahead of time and come to an agreement on starting earlier and planning to leave earlier.\n\nThere is nothing in the way he reacted that was anything approaching \"adult like\".

They can be on time if it is important to them.", "I totally agree. :)\n\nCommunication is the key!", "I've dealt with it and the way I solved it is by holding the person to the time that they are supposed to start getting ready by and you build in a buffer.  You get agreement ahead of time.\n\nHis actions did not result in anything approaching improved behavior on his wife's part.  The result is she stayed with her parents for a week.  That's a terrible result!  He may have said \"she does it all the time\", but there is no way to consider that a \"normal\" behavior in a healthy relationship.  That's what your spouse does when he/she is so fucking pissed that they can't stand to be around you.\n\nHis actions clearly took him closer to a divorce.  When you intentional choose actions that make your life worse, that further erode a relationship, you are the AH. That's what he did.", "NTA.\n\nLateness is rudeness.", "NTA, she's the asshole for constantly making you late just because she's too selfish to care about anyone besides herself!", "I am late all the time and I honestly don't mean it, it stresses me out that I'm late but it doesn't seem to matter how early I start getting ready, I will still be late because I get distracted and can't help getting distracted. It pisses everyone I know off, and it's by far my biggest fault. I have found that listening to music helps me, my brain seems to struggle to comprehend how much time has passed so I measure things in songs, like it takes me 3 songs to do my make up etc so I tell myself I have X amount of songs before I need to leave. Doesn't always work but has helped a bit. I don't think you're an AH in this situation but you could have handled the issue better and come from a more supportive place.", "NTA.  This is the only thing to do with chronically late AHs.", "Absolutely NTA and GOOD FOR YOU. I was married to a pathologically late person for 20 years and I finally started doing this kind of thing much much too late (IRONICALLY ENOUGH), several years after I should have. Lateness like this is controlling, it is narcissistic, it is childish and it is absolutely inexcusable.  I'm sure you can tell that I am still extremely angry about this and we have been divorced for five years! My now-fiance and I were both five minutes early to our first date, and we both laughed.
