Ask niece if she will make two portions for you or your wife to pick up and reheat at home, and you will pay her.\n\n3. Look into those meal delivery kits that come with instructions and ingredients.\n\n4. Sit with wife and explain exactly what\u2019s wrong with her cooking. Is it overdone, underdone, too bland, a weird concoction that doesn\u2019t go together? Talk TOGETHER about ways to improve. Look up recipes on Pinterest and simple how to videos on YouTube. Meal plan together.\n\n5. You meal prep with your wife on your day off. Meal plan for the week. Together prep the meat for tacos, or spaghetti, or a chicken casserole, etc., and freeze them. Defrost one package each day and all wife needs to do is warm the meat and boil pasta or cut up taco toppings or throw casserole ingredients in a pan and bake it. In fact, many casseroles can be frozen whole and then defrosted and baked. Make a large pot of soup and freeze portions. Wife can buy a baguette on soup day. So many easy meals to make this way.\n\n6. Get takeout every night.\n\nEdited to add: 7. Get a good crock pot. At night, both of you work together to throw in the ingredients for a meal and store the crock in the fridge. At X time the next day, wife puts the crock into the heating unit and turns it on.
