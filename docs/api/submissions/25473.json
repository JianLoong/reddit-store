While our relationship is blossoming, we've hit a financial snag that\u2019s causing tension.\n\nFor context, I earn six figures, while she earns significantly less. I've always held a belief in splitting mutual expenses 50/50, even if there's an income disparity. However, I've been staunch in my stance that I shouldn\u2019t contribute to her children's expenses because we're still in the early stages of our relationship.\n\nHere's a recent example: We all went to McDonald's for a quick bite. I covered my meal, and she had to pay for herself and all of her kids. She looked a bit embarrassed when one of her kids asked for an additional item and she hesitated, counting her money. While I did offer to buy the extra item, I didn't pitch in for the rest of their meals. She later told me that she felt I could've been more generous given our income differences, especially in front of her children.\n\nI understand where she's coming from, but I believe in personal responsibility. My upbringing taught me the value of money, and I feel that her children's expenses are her responsibility.\n\nSo, AITA for sticking to my principles and not helping out financially for her kids during our outings?\n\nEdit: 4 children. **McDonald\u2019s was the children\u2019s idea that she agreed to**. The McDonald\u2019s meals were nearly $50 just for the children. We\u2019ve been together for 2ish months.\n\nEdit: I like the girl and I like her kids. They are cool children. To those asking if I want to marry the girl or see a long future with her. How the fuck should I know? We\u2019ve only been seeing each other for 2 months.\n\nEdit3: **it was not my idea to be involved with the children this early**", "created_utc": 1692968418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160ymlo/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_girlfriends_kids/", "score": 944, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And that's fine, you're 100% within your rights, just recognize that in yourself and cut her loose, because she is never, ever going to be able to do 50/50 with you if she makes that much less and has some kids.  Better not to waste her time.", "NTA it's weird that OP has met her kids so soon into the relationship and I definitely wouldn't expect someone I'd known for five minutes to be paying for anything for my children, so something about this feels off on her end", "2 months and you've met the kids?", "NAH\n\nNot the asshole, but perhaps soon an ex? \n\nWhile I agree that a relationship needs balance, this is perhaps not the way to do it? If she can't afford McDonald's for all, perhaps you could have planned ahead and brought sandwiches?

Why should OP be responsible for feeding the kids of a person he just started dating?\n\nThey don't live together.\n\nJust because he earns more doesn't make him responsible for feeding her kids.  That's her job as their mother.\n\nAt worst I would say ESH because a conversation *could* have happened when the kids asked for McDonalds, where Mom could have said she was tight on money.  The OP could have offered to pay or suggested something else.  But to think he should have paid because he's the dude, he makes more money than she does, or whatever your convoluted and misguided brains came up with, OP is not ultimately responsible to pay for the kids that belong to his 2 month GF.\n\nI am going with NTA.", "What in the Bebe\u2019s kids is this. \u201cMultiple children\u201d what, does she have more than you can count?

You could have paid for the McDonalds; refusing to do so was ungenerous and unkind. \n\nAlso: \"I've always held a belief in splitting mutual expenses 50/50, even if there's an income disparity,\" is asinine in my opinion--that's not logical and not how a partnership works.", "NTA the fact tht you have met the kids and they are on dates with you is very odd and a red flag for me. Yall have been dating all of 2 months that is way too soon to meet the kids. Even if you go on a date a week you all have met only 8 times. \n\nI understand YTA are looking at it as a one time incident and the moral stand point of always feed kids but I see OP point of it is a wider pattern. The girl barely knows OP is bringing her kids on dates and expecting him to pay. Its not a good look and I understand OP standing firm in his boundaries. She seems to be testing the waters here on what he will and won't do.  Yes kids are Package deals and very early stages that extends to having grace when it comes to last minute canceling or struggling to plan a date bc they have to get babysitting. When they finally meet it means be nice to the kids and trying to get to know them. Once they get to know them more it means it's a serious relationship and then spending money on the kids come in because it is going to be a long term relationship. 8 dates isn't enough to know if it should have gotten to that stage of meet the kids a lot of steps were skipped so I can see why OP is pumping the breaks and drawing boundaries. \n\nThis sub bias against men is showing on this one and I am saying this as a woman. They are giving the mom every excuse in the book on why her jumping ahead is an okay and a good sign when it is a huge red flag.", "NTA - 2 months is nothing at all.

Nope.\n\nIs she the asshole for having any expectation you would help her out  with this? Yup.\n\nIs she also the asshole for promising her kids a meal she couldn\u2019t fully/easily afford?

I think I would tell her, hey look, I'm not paying for your kids all the time, if we get married one day, different story, but I'll start picking up the tab here and there because I like you and the kids and would like to see where this goes.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable EVER paying for the kids, you should leave this relationship now, because they are a package deal, and if you marry her and then force her to still pay for everything for them, THEN you are a massive asshole.", "She\u2019s an A for introducing her kids to you this early.

You'll have to dump her for not respecting your finacial boundries. Unfortunately this is exactly why most men don't like dating single mothers. Especially if you make good money. Ya'll have only been dating for a few months. She needs to chill and accept her reality. Ya'll ain't there YET. Give it a year and I'm sure by then you'll be willing to pay a bill or two at least.

I never dated ladies who weren't ok with it, personal preference. You would be an AH if you did not set that boundary early. Frankly, I didn't date ladies with kids because it was a non-starter for me. Now I'm married and have my own kid, I happily pay. My wife was a SAHM for years, we discussed it ahead of time and set our expectations accordingly.

You did mention though that you make quite a bit more than her, and it was Mcdonalds. She wasn't asking you to buy the child a brand new car. In fact if it was such a big deal you could have just paid the little extra and had a discussion about it later in private. It sounds like you two aren't on the same page regarding finances and maybe never will be, so the relationship wouldn't last, which is one reason her kids should never have been involved. \nFor all of that YTA.
