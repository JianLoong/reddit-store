While our relationship is blossoming, we've hit a financial snag that\u2019s causing tension.\n\nFor context, I earn six figures, while she earns significantly less. I've always held a belief in splitting mutual expenses 50/50, even if there's an income disparity. However, I've been staunch in my stance that I shouldn\u2019t contribute to her children's expenses because we're still in the early stages of our relationship.\n\nHere's a recent example: We all went to McDonald's for a quick bite. I covered my meal, and she had to pay for herself and all of her kids. She looked a bit embarrassed when one of her kids asked for an additional item and she hesitated, counting her money. While I did offer to buy the extra item, I didn't pitch in for the rest of their meals. She later told me that she felt I could've been more generous given our income differences, especially in front of her children.\n\nI understand where she's coming from, but I believe in personal responsibility. My upbringing taught me the value of money, and I feel that her children's expenses are her responsibility.\n\nSo, AITA for sticking to my principles and not helping out financially for her kids during our outings?\n\nEdit: 4 children. **McDonald\u2019s was the children\u2019s idea that she agreed to**. The McDonald\u2019s meals were nearly $50 just for the children. We\u2019ve been together for 2ish months.\n\nEdit: I like the girl and I like her kids. They are cool children. To those asking if I want to marry the girl or see a long future with her. How the fuck should I know? We\u2019ve only been seeing each other for 2 months.\n\nEdit3: **it was not my idea to be involved with the children this early**\n\nFinal edit: yes, I make 6 figures pre tax. After taxes about 40% immediately disappears into my retirement accounts to max them out. After that another 30% goes to my own rent and utilities. With the remaining 30% 10% gets saved for charity. The remaining 20% covers my own groceries (I typically cook for myself) and my own hobbies. **I am not swimming in money**", "created_utc": 1692968418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160ymlo/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_girlfriends_kids/", "score": 3778, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're already nickel and diming children on a trip to McDonalds with this \"fantastic woman\", you're a cheap bastard who cares more about $50 than about the fantastic woman.  And that's fine, you're 100% within your rights, just recognize that in yourself and cut her loose, because she is never, ever going to be able to do 50/50 with you if she makes that much less and has some kids.  Better not to waste her time.", "NTA it's weird that OP has met her kids so soon into the relationship and I definitely wouldn't expect someone I'd known for five minutes to be paying for anything for my children, so something about this feels off on her end", "2 months and you've met the kids?", "NAH\n\nNot the asshole, but perhaps soon an ex? \n\nWhile I agree that a relationship needs balance, this is perhaps not the way to do it? If she can't afford McDonald's for all, perhaps you could have planned ahead and brought sandwiches?

Why should OP be responsible for feeding the kids of a person he just started dating?\n\nThey don't live together.\n\nJust because he earns more doesn't make him responsible for feeding her kids.  That's her job as their mother.\n\nAt worst I would say ESH because a conversation *could* have happened when the kids asked for McDonalds, where Mom could have said she was tight on money.  The OP could have offered to pay or suggested something else.  But to think he should have paid because he's the dude, he makes more money than she does, or whatever your convoluted and misguided brains came up with, OP is not ultimately responsible to pay for the kids that belong to his 2 month GF.\n\nI am going with NTA.", "What in the Bebe\u2019s kids is this. \u201cMultiple children\u201d what, does she have more than you can count?

Your entire attitude toward this woman is stingy and condescending. You could have paid for the McDonalds; refusing to do so was ungenerous and unkind. \n\nAlso: \"I've always held a belief in splitting mutual expenses 50/50, even if there's an income disparity,\" is asinine in my opinion--that's not logical and not how a partnership works.", "NTA the fact tht you have met the kids and they are on dates with you is very odd and a red flag for me. Yall have been dating all of 2 months that is way too soon to meet the kids. Even if you go on a date a week you all have met only 8 times. \n\nI understand YTA are looking at it as a one time incident and the moral stand point of always feed kids but I see OP point of it is a wider pattern. The girl barely knows OP is bringing her kids on dates and expecting him to pay. Its not a good look and I understand OP standing firm in his boundaries. She seems to be testing the waters here on what he will and won't do.  Yes kids are Package deals and very early stages that extends to having grace when it comes to last minute canceling or struggling to plan a date bc they have to get babysitting. When they finally meet it means be nice to the kids and trying to get to know them. Once they get to know them more it means it's a serious relationship and then spending money on the kids come in because it is going to be a long term relationship. 8 dates isn't enough to know if it should have gotten to that stage of meet the kids a lot of steps were skipped so I can see why OP is pumping the breaks and drawing boundaries. \n\nThis sub bias against men is showing on this one and I am saying this as a woman. They are giving the mom every excuse in the book on why her jumping ahead is an okay and a good sign when it is a huge red flag.", "NTA - 2 months is nothing at all.

Nope.\n\nIs she the asshole for having any expectation you would help her out  with this? Yup.\n\nIs she also the asshole for promising her kids a meal she couldn\u2019t fully/easily afford?

It\u2019s clear she\u2019s looking for someone to pay her way and pay for her kids something her ex should be doing since he\u2019s the one that made them.

I think I would tell her, hey look, I'm not paying for your kids all the time, if we get married one day, different story, but I'll start picking up the tab here and there because I like you and the kids and would like to see where this goes.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable EVER paying for the kids, you should leave this relationship now, because they are a package deal, and if you marry her and then force her to still pay for everything for them, THEN you are a massive asshole.", "She\u2019s an A for introducing her kids to you this early.

You'll have to dump her for not respecting your finacial boundries. Unfortunately this is exactly why most men don't like dating single mothers. Especially if you make good money. Ya'll have only been dating for a few months. She needs to chill and accept her reality. Ya'll ain't there YET. Give it a year and I'm sure by then you'll be willing to pay a bill or two at least.

I never dated ladies who weren't ok with it, personal preference. You would be an AH if you did not set that boundary early. Frankly, I didn't date ladies with kids because it was a non-starter for me. Now I'm married and have my own kid, I happily pay. My wife was a SAHM for years, we discussed it ahead of time and set our expectations accordingly.

You did mention though that you make quite a bit more than her, and it was Mcdonalds. She wasn't asking you to buy the child a brand new car. In fact if it was such a big deal you could have just paid the little extra and had a discussion about it later in private. It sounds like you two aren't on the same page regarding finances and maybe never will be, so the relationship wouldn't last, which is one reason her kids should never have been involved. \nFor all of that YTA.

I think your views on money, on being a partner and how you would treat her kids if you went into a serious relationship are showing very early on that you will nickel and dime the woman to death.  Honestly, that\u2019s a deal breaker for me.  I have no problem with sharing expenses but treating her and her kids to McDonald\u2019s shouldn\u2019t be something you are so against.  In the scheme of things you told her $50 is more important to you than her, her kids and your potentially growing relationship.  As a mom, if you want to invest in a relationship with me you need to be aware that you are also investing in a relationship with my child when the time is right for me to introduce you to him.  Dating a single mom isn\u2019t just dating the mom it\u2019s dating the kids too.  It\u2019s a package deal. There\u2019s going to be times where she can\u2019t go out because no sitter, a kid is sick, a kid needs help with homework, etc.  There\u2019s going to be times when money is tight, the car broke down, rent is due, mom had to miss 3 days of work because of a sick kid and little Joey needs new shoes all in the same week and she is like shit I can\u2019t afford to go to that concert, out for dinner, etc. \n\nMy husband and I take turns on who pays.  I usually want to go out more so I pay more often than him.  We also adjust the level of places we go to based on who is paying.  When my hubby is paying Texas Roadhouse is expensive for him, when I pay we might go to a high end steakhouse which is expensive for me.  I don\u2019t care where he takes me, it can be a Chinese buffet in town, the important thing to me is we are together, happy and healthy.  I\u2019m also stoked I don\u2019t have to cook and clean up so a pizza on the couch with Netflix is cool too", "100%.  dated a guy that made me pay for my own taco bell in the drive thru with him driving. Separate orders. Def a \ud83d\udea9.  my  gf used to make 3x what I made and it was initially a struggle to fairly split our rent, but she ultimately saw why that was fair.

I don't know what is radicalizing so many children and young men, but it's not going to work out well for their generation, or for them, personally.\n\nBeing overly concerned with 50/50 splits is a red flag because I always see people do that so strictly with their money, but nothing else. They'll have a partner that puts in an inordinate amount of emotional and mental effort into the relationship while the other one puts in none or very little and penny-pinches. It's not equality, it's making sure that half of one person's responsibilities are foisted upon the partner that is more willing to be a doormat. In this case, a working class single mom that is no doubt reminded at every turn that she's not allowed to have any respect for herself, because she's some sort of \"used goods\" or whatever the jargon the mouthbreathing incels have come up with these days, I'm not in the habit of knowing.\n\nMy wife basically paid nearly 100% of the time when we were dating because I had to invest so much more time and effort because her job was demanding (and paid 3x what mine did) and mine was not (and paid 3x less, plus I had more debt because I had less familial wealth). It evened out in the end, especially since she's had much longer spats of unemployment, was in school for a while, and now I make 3x more than her.

They'll want to date women they increasingly have even less and less in common with. If they have money, it might patch it over for a bit, but not really for long. And they're ultimately going to miss out on really important experiences in life. They're the ones who are building the prisons of emotional misery they live in and then locking themselves inside.", "This was my thought. 15+ years into a relationship and I honestly have no idea how we split finances.

I grew up without familial wealth and people with it? Treat you like lepers.

Like you can bust ass and go nowhere and they don't want to believe it.\n\nSo the 50/50 crap comes from that. It's a way of forcing people to agree with your worldview, which is that you deserve to be poor, and they deserve to be wealthy, and thus the poor person has to pay more of their income for everything to be \"equal\" because it's not fair for someone that is so much morally better to subsidize the lifestyle of someone who makes less, *even if they purportedly love them*.

So they keep dating poor women, women that are so beaten down by life (and other men) that their expectations are low enough they'd date someone that disrepects them like that. But then their BF, who *self-selects* for poorer women, gets mad and bitter that the women he dates are poor, not ever realizing that *the problem is always them.*\n\nLike I have a lot of female friends that are extremely highly educated. Lawyers, dentists, doctors, even surgeons. They *struggle* to find single men that want to date them because so many men have fallen into this black hole of incel dating strategy where ambitious independent women scare the absolute shit out of them.\n\nIt leaves men that are worried about gold-diggers dating nothing but poorer women that they hate, and all the women that can support themselves fighting for men wealthier than them (who also want to date gold-digger, but unlike incels, don't typically hate them) or finding themselves settling down with absolute fucking losers that wind up hating their ambitious wives because they don't make as much as them and that makes them insecure.\n\nAnyways, the heteros aren't okay.", "Mazel tov to your healthy and long-lasting relationship. We're going on eight years of marriage here, and yes, we never really had a huge conversation about finances. We'd be dating and she would call me up like \"there's a fancy new Mexican place by my house that just opened, artisanal margaritas, wanna go\" and I'd be like \"I don't get paid until Friday and I need to make sure I can cover my student loan payment and rent beforehand\" so she'd answer \"no, I want to go now, I'm paying, don't be stupid.\" And that would be the end of that. Like I would put big stuff like my own plane tickets or whatever when we went on a vacation we planned together on my card, but she lived in a really ritzy area of town for her job and I worked retail, so she just wound up paying most of the time because she wanted to do stuff there, so I couldn't afford it. But then I would have her over and cook for her and we'd get wasted and walk to Taco Bell at 2am for Baja Blasts and I'd pay. So it wasn't equal but it never felt *unequitable* because we were both spending time and effort on each other to meet each other where we were in life. And that's always worked for us. There's been times she's been unemployed and I'm still coughing up like $5K on a dance lesson package for her because it makes her happy, and I just never really cared? Because I trust her with my finances? I don't know why people are dating people they don't trust or respect.", "That sort of black-and-white thinking is deeply embarrassing when you're over the age of like 25, though. After that age, it's less about natural immaturity and brain development and becomes more and more indicative of a serious personality or mental disorder. I try to keep in mind that a lot of people on Reddit (and elsewhere) are under 25 so it does make sense that nuance doesn't really come through and their emotional IQ is low.

Meals start at $8-9 near me and you can easily spend $35 taking the family out. If you got to eat twice a day every day, you can spend thousands a month going out. If you just don't have time and don't want fresh produce to rot, just about everything in the frozen section is cheaper and easier than McDonalds.\n\nBut as a counterpoint, when I was single feeding just one, I can totally understand doing takeaway and going out semi-frequently since economies of scale don't work as well as they do when it's a family of 3 or 4. $12 for Pad Thai is hard to beat when it lasts 1 - 2 meals.", "When was the last time you ate at McDonald's?", "The mcdonalds in my area is hella expensive.
