I pay rent $500 a month and my parents don't care if I only have $200 a week for food gas and anything else I need they still want rent. Recently I started picking up lots of overtime to try and get myself out of the debt I got myself in so i was not home a lot. I paid my younger sibling weekly to take care of my dog that I own. The requirements were feeding him and letting him to go potty. Apparently this had not been done and my dad was forced to take over this job. One night when I out at dinner my father kicked my dog outside in the cold while he was still wet from a bath. We have no shelter or even beds outside. It is just a giant concrete pad. I was told he is not allowed to come inside at all anymore no matter what. This was a one of the major breaking points for me among many other things my dad has pulled. I have supported myself since I was 17 for the most part. I took care of myself, loaned him money, and I have never borrowed money from him. He recently threatened to kick me out of me leaving 2 items on the dining table for less than 20 min. He complained that I was not considerate of everyone in the house. I am not here, I work, I only leave my room to cook food and I always clean all of my dishes afterwards. I have turned into a glorified roommate.
