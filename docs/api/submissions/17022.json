But make her see that you value her regardless and that you just want to share something that you find really good with her.\n\nI was in a similar situation with my boyfriend, I gained a lot of weight, and when I would complain and feel bad about it he just encouraged me to get where I wanted to be and told me that if I really wanted it, I was able to accomplish it and that definitely helped me to start my fitness journey again; he always pushes me to be the best version of myself and never has made me feel unloved regardless the way I look. So positive talk, encouragement and good communication definitely is the way.\n\nSomething else that can help is maybe find an activity that she also enjoys and share that with her, the truth is that the gym is not for everyone but maybe she likes to go for a walk, or ride a bike, or do pilates, and the do it together.", "YTA, she was thinking out loud and probably expressing insecurity, which everyone experiences.

Don\u2019t get me wrong there\u2019s women out there peddling their BBLs as authentic muscle attained through training when it\u2019s just a dangerous cosmetic procedure that gave them that look but thankfully this type of behaviour is beginning to be shunned in the fitness community. \n\nSame with fake naturals who claim they have never used PEDs when their physiques are obviously enhanced. But even then many people assume the drugs do all the work which is incredibly wrong. They\u2019re called PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS for a reason. They allow you to push past your natural abilities but you still need to put in the work, and take it from someone who did that route for 2 years. It\u2019s far more work than just being natural, having to worry about everything fitness related plus your blood panels and related hormones.\n\nAt no point did you body shame your girlfriend, you said you had tried to have her come with you before but never pushed her and she said she doesn\u2019t enjoy it and you know what? Thats okay! Not everyone has to be into it, its a unique lifestyle that not everyone wants to pursue. But when those same people sit and complain about how they want to look like the people living that lifestyle but refuse to make any changes to their own lifestyle to start working towards it, it just becomes grating and annoying. \n\nYou said you were excited she might want to give it another try and that you were looking forward to making it into a hobby that both of you can enjoy both in terms of the act of working out but also the benefits that come from it (Looking better, feeling better, health benefits etc;) But yeah as someone who lives this lifestyle and plans to live it till the day I am taken from this earth. I don\u2019t entertain people like this anymore. I have spent so much time trying to help people and give them advice to get into it but at the end of the day the only ones who stuck with it were the ones who wanted to actually put in the work. \n\nIt\u2019s like if I sit around saying \u201cI really wish i drove a Ferrari\u201d but then continue to do nothing to improve my financial status to the point where I could afford to own one. Then complained to someone who owned one about it and they then told me \u201cwell you need to have enough money to afford the car and the costs the come with it.\u201d If i got upset and threw a fit at that comment people would think i\u2019m a brat who wants those luxuries for free or at the least a heavily discounted rate and probably think me a bit crazy no?How is it any different when it comes to wanting a fit physique but refusing to do anything fitness related.\n\nUnfortunately this likely will become a point of contention more often in your relationship as it sounds like you\u2019re really enjoying all the positives that come from the lifestyle. Maybe there is an underlying reason why she doesn\u2019t like it? A past traumatic experience related to working out or maybe a feeling of being overwhelmed with it all. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here but because you\u2019re the man and she the women in this scenario you\u2019ll be seen as a chauvinistic pig who\u2019s body shaming his girlfriend for wanting to help her achieve something she has actively expressed a desire in having. \n\nI can only imagine if the roles were reversed the amount of NTA and \u201cgirl leave him and find yourself a strong man willing to put the work in for you\u201d type comments that would be flying around here.

It all depends on what your partner is comfortable with. And in this case, it doesn\u2019t seem like it was what he was looking at that was the problem. She didn\u2019t have a negative reaction to that part. The problem was that she was, consciously or not, looking for reassurance that he loves her body just the way it is.

Sometimes having shared passions is really important to some people. Others are more than happy to have separate passions. That\u2019s really on you to decide op. But you probably shouldn\u2019t be holding your breath hoping one day she wakes up and is all of the sudden super passionate about exercising.

It *could* happen, I just wouldn\u2019t be counting on it. Some people really do have to force themselves to exercise and never get any of that enjoyment and euphoria out of it.

Do you know that different people have different needs? Do you know that empathy isn\u2019t a value everyone wants? Some people feel coddled and babied by empathy? Get your high school psychology shit out of here and develop a nuanced perspective.", "No I'm just not a dense idiot who doesn't know how to read between the lines.", "People who do this do it because they don't want to be respons8ble for it.", ">high protein low carb is unhealthy\n\nYeah, no, you're objectively wrong here. I won't endorse keto because that's extreme, but outside of that, no. Stop it.", "It\u2019s low intensity on your lower body, but the rigid, hunched over position can be hard on your back back and gripping the handlebars can worsen pain in your hands. Swimming can really promote alignment if you take the time to learn proper technique. I like riding a bike but swimming can alleviate joint pain.", "Going to the gym and dieting are absolutely options, are we just going to pretend that those things are no longer effective?", "My point is the statement \u201cyou should love the way your partner looks\u201d seems wrong to me. You can\u2019t control whether you love how your partner looks and it seems silly and shallow to break up with someone you love and still want to be with just because you don\u2019t love the way they look.\n\nWe don\u2019t know that OP loves the way his partner looks , and so he may have been in a situation where the options are lie, tell an extremely hard truth or take their comment at face value, he went for option 3 which is hard to fault. Again we don\u2019t know this is the case, so if you\u2019re calling him an AH on the basis of that I think there\u2019s more info required", "I'm curious, being this obtuse, does it come naturally for you?", "I'd grow to love you shutting up.   Respectfully.", "Jesus Christ the projection. Incredible.", "No, I\u2019m calling him the AH because he wasn\u2019t asked for a solution or an opinion, she was asking for reassurance.\n\nThat\u2019s what you do in a relationship.", "If Im being obtuse, then please explain to me why her going to the gym, despite saying she wants a body like women who go to the gym, not an option? OP probably should have led by telling his girlfriend how beautiful he thinks her to be, and made sure to emphasize that he wasn't trying to pressure her, but I see no flaw with the core of his statement.", "Lmaooo", "You shouldn\u2019t lie about it if it\u2019s not true though. You said you should love the way your partner looks, you absolutely can\u2019t control that. \n\nIf you don\u2019t love the way your partner looks, how do you reassure them in that situation", "It\u2019s not always necessary to be 100% truthful 100% of the time. Because it\u2019s not always appropriate, you need to exercise judgement and empathy.\n\nIf you really can\u2019t show that amount of empathy for your partner by saying there\u2019s nothing wrong with the way that they look, then that\u2019s a problem. \n\nIf his partner had said, \u201cHow can I look more like those women?\u201d then saying \u201cthis is how they work out\u201d would have been an appropriate response, but that\u2019s not what she said.\n\nBut he could\u2019ve even said \u201cI\u2019m not following these women to ogle them. I\u2019m following them because they give really good health advice, the same reason that I follow the guys.\u201d Which would be the truth.", "I don\u2019t agree about the first part. I don\u2019t think you should ever bring a hurtful truth to someone unprovoked but if someone wants your opinion and you respect them, you should give them your opinion. That\u2019s absolutely what I would want for myself. I really don\u2019t think you can claim it\u2019s empathetic to lie to someone, it\u2019s selfish for an easy life, not empathetic. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand how you would phrase it without lying or it just sounding awful, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing wrong with the way you look\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly sound like the reassurance she would be looking for and that sounds like the kindest way to tell the truth in that situation."]}
