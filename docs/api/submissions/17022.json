Also encourage her in a positive way to get the body that she wants, saying stuff like \u201cyou can do anything you want, I believe in you and will support you with whatever you decide to do\u201d, (just to put an example). But make her see that you value her regardless and that you just want to share something that you find really good with her.\n\nI was in a similar situation with my boyfriend, I gained a lot of weight, and when I would complain and feel bad about it he just encouraged me to get where I wanted to be and told me that if I really wanted it, I was able to accomplish it and that definitely helped me to start my fitness journey again; he always pushes me to be the best version of myself and never has made me feel unloved regardless the way I look. So positive talk, encouragement and good communication definitely is the way.\n\nSomething else that can help is maybe find an activity that she also enjoys and share that with her, the truth is that the gym is not for everyone but maybe she likes to go for a walk, or ride a bike, or do pilates, and the do it together.", "YTA, she was thinking out loud and probably expressing insecurity, which everyone experiences.

Don\u2019t get me wrong there\u2019s women out there peddling their BBLs as authentic muscle attained through training when it\u2019s just a dangerous cosmetic procedure that gave them that look but thankfully this type of behaviour is beginning to be shunned in the fitness community. \n\nSame with fake naturals who claim they have never used PEDs when their physiques are obviously enhanced. But even then many people assume the drugs do all the work which is incredibly wrong. They\u2019re called PERFORMANCE ENHANCING DRUGS for a reason. They allow you to push past your natural abilities but you still need to put in the work, and take it from someone who did that route for 2 years. It\u2019s far more work than just being natural, having to worry about everything fitness related plus your blood panels and related hormones.\n\nAt no point did you body shame your girlfriend, you said you had tried to have her come with you before but never pushed her and she said she doesn\u2019t enjoy it and you know what? Thats okay! Not everyone has to be into it, its a unique lifestyle that not everyone wants to pursue. But when those same people sit and complain about how they want to look like the people living that lifestyle but refuse to make any changes to their own lifestyle to start working towards it, it just becomes grating and annoying. \n\nYou said you were excited she might want to give it another try and that you were looking forward to making it into a hobby that both of you can enjoy both in terms of the act of working out but also the benefits that come from it (Looking better, feeling better, health benefits etc;) But yeah as someone who lives this lifestyle and plans to live it till the day I am taken from this earth. I don\u2019t entertain people like this anymore. I have spent so much time trying to help people and give them advice to get into it but at the end of the day the only ones who stuck with it were the ones who wanted to actually put in the work. \n\nIt\u2019s like if I sit around saying \u201cI really wish i drove a Ferrari\u201d but then continue to do nothing to improve my financial status to the point where I could afford to own one. Then complained to someone who owned one about it and they then told me \u201cwell you need to have enough money to afford the car and the costs the come with it.\u201d If i got upset and threw a fit at that comment people would think i\u2019m a brat who wants those luxuries for free or at the least a heavily discounted rate and probably think me a bit crazy no?How is it any different when it comes to wanting a fit physique but refusing to do anything fitness related.\n\nUnfortunately this likely will become a point of contention more often in your relationship as it sounds like you\u2019re really enjoying all the positives that come from the lifestyle. Maybe there is an underlying reason why she doesn\u2019t like it? A past traumatic experience related to working out or maybe a feeling of being overwhelmed with it all. \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong here but because you\u2019re the man and she the women in this scenario you\u2019ll be seen as a chauvinistic pig who\u2019s body shaming his girlfriend for wanting to help her achieve something she has actively expressed a desire in having. \n\nI can only imagine if the roles were reversed the amount of NTA and \u201cgirl leave him and find yourself a strong man willing to put the work in for you\u201d type comments that would be flying around here.

Your answer to her ALSO reads as if you're unsatisfied with her body. \n\nShe was making an emotional bid and asking for reassurance, \"if these gym girls show up on your fyp is that what you're into? Do you like those types of bodies better than mine?\"\n\nWas she clear about what she was really asking? Of course not and she could have worded it better. \n\nBut your insistence on taking her to the gym really does come off as if you think somethings wrong with the way she looks and you keep pushing for her to change. \n\nIf it's about sharing hobbies can't it be literally ANY other hobby? And if it can't, I really think you should clarify to her that it's about doing this thing together and not about wanting to change her because you love her and she's perfect for you just the way she is. \n\nYou weren't born yesterday, you know the society we live in, so please don't pretend you can push to take her to the gym and she's supposed to believe that's not a commentary on her looks when she sees reel after reel of toned asses on your tiktok.", "So she wanted him to lie.", "ffs my *mom* is muscular and she's nearing 70 and nowhere near as active as you claim is needed. daily walk + not overeating + not sitting on your bum all day + picking up a hobby like gardening will do wonders. just get active somehow.", "1. the actors in the avengers are not bodybuilders or gym goers lol. they\u2019re for the most part just weak and skinny. they have good lighting and makeup on their bodies.\n\nthe only two exceptions are thor and captain america. BOTH ROIDED. you will not achieve that naturally for 95% of the world.\n\nbtw all the other guys are roided too. they just don\u2019t care enough to get BIG.\n\n2. going to the gym is not enough. while it\u2019s incredibly stupid to cut out whole food groups. you SHOULD be planning weighing and tracking every single thing in your body. is that just not common sense? \n\n3. while 3 hours a day is excessive\u2026 don\u2019t expect results going 3x a week lol\u2026.", "That's not the point here. Read everything again.", "I used to take ballroom dancing classes and I would love to get back into it. It's a lot of fun and after the first few weeks it doesn't really feel like exercise. I started shedding pounds like crazy when I was doing it. My sister-in-law started doing Bachata and it was the same for her and she's also found a really supportive community of friends in the process. There are a lot of benefits to dance that don't just center around exercise and weight loss.\n\nMy judgement for the post is ESH. I understand him wanting to share his hobby with her, but he should have just listened and let her vent. At the same time she should have communicated what she wanted rather than just getting mad and storming off.", "> her goal here isn\u2019t to be healthy. her goal is to look better. i\u2019m sorry even an activity like biking is GARBAGE for muscle building.\n\nThat's not entirely true, but it's just simply that it does it only for the lower body. It gets you amazing calves, for instance. I remember I was literally an underweight stick in high school and I gained actual leg muscle from cycling. Considering OP's wife probably doesn't exercise at all, she would probably get those gains as well. \n\nBut I agree with the general message of your comment.", "> simply going to the gym won\u2019t work anyways \n\nare you implying that she won\u2019t get that body unless she takes PEDs? or, are you saying it\u2019s because it takes extra time (like years) to display the same amount of muscle those fitness influencers have", "Well, if it's an unhealthy body, then he is being helpful and she is being obtuse.", "Nope.  Not the reason why", "Are they not doing exactly that by informing their partner about their true feelings giving them the power to do with that knowledge what they want? Maybe they still want to be with their partner despite that they don\u2019t think they look fantastic. Everybody is flawed and it\u2019s inevitable there is something about about your partner you don\u2019t like or are even just lukewarm on, just because one of those things someone is lukewarm on is their looks doesn\u2019t mean that has to be the end.", "What if the way they look has changed over time? Once you no longer love the way they look, despite still loving who they are, should you just be like \u201csorry gonna have to break up with you I don\u2019t love the way you look anymore\u201d", "biking is pretty low intensity too", "At least you're single now", "If I said \u201cI would love to look like them\u201d and she said well you could if you went to the gym, I would think that\u2019s a perfectly reasonable statement", "She should learn how to deal with it.", "Soon you'll be looking at her walking out of your life and saying \"damn, I wish I had a girlfriend like that!\" Then you'll look down at this post and have your answer.", "If your gf commented on how another man was built, how much more muscular/toned he was than you, while he and similar men where on her insta,tiktok,etc. \nIt wouldn't feel good. If she told you she wished you looked like these men who are stronger and more resilient than you, it would not feel good. \nIt's the same vibe dude. Tiktok shows you what you want to see, and obvi you wanna see gym rat babes. Get a fucking clue.", "only the people in the relationship can decide what their boundaries are around consuming such content", "Door is over there if you don't like it.", "Nope!", "OP never told his girlfriend that he wished she lookwd like these other women. While you\u2019re busy having a tantrum, at least get your facts straight.", "Um, he didn\u2019t say any of that.", "Yeah, you still don't seem to understand.", "I don\u2019t.  Please enlighten me."]}
