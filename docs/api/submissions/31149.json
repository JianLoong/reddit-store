My wife Elizabeth (41, not her real name) and I were talking a few nights ago while I was doing the dishes. I had also done the weekly grocery shopping, bathed and put our daughter to bed. Elizabeth's day was busy too, she works full time, drops off/picks up our kid at school, had taken her to dancing. She started telling me about problems at work. I listened a few minutes, then she started complaining about my family and their communication skills. We have a family get together this weekend and the plans are unclear because my family are poor communicators. I acknowledged this, then said \"Can we talk about something more positive? I want to talk with and spend time with you, but I'd like to discuss things that build me up.\" She stopped, stared daggers at me, said \"That was not OK\u201d and walked off upstairs.\n\nThe next day I was coming home early but hit traffic. She called when I was in the car, we chatted, then she said I sounded upset and asked me if what\u2019s wrong. I said \"I'm aggravated because for the 1st time in 2 weeks I left work after 10 hrs not 12, but got caught in traffic and I'm going to get home at the same time anyway. She said \"How would you feel if I said 'Can we talk about something more positive?'\" I hung up. I got home about 5 minutes later and when I walked in the door she said \"That was not OK.\"\n\nAfter dinner I said \"I know you're upset, so let's discuss it now so it doesn't fester.\" Elizabeth said that last night she \u201cjust needed to vent and needed me to listen.\" I said I could listen some, but was so worn out I didn't have the capacity to listen to much negativity. I said I know my family's communication skills are poor, but I still didn't want to hear her bash them minutes on end.\r  \nElizabeth said it wasn't OK I hung up on her and I was out of line. I said \"You asked me what was bothering me, then when I told you said \"can we talk about something more positive?\" It felt like you baited me, then took a shot at me because you were upset about last night.\" She said it wasn't a shot, I\u2019d f-ing know if she took an f-ing shot, she was trying to teach me empathy for another human because I'm not empathetic. I apologized for hanging up on her, and said that there was a better way I could have handled that interaction by saying something like \"that felt like a shot, what was your intent?\u201d\n\r\nElizabeth said \"why does that feel like a shot? That's a you thing, you need to work on how you take the things I say, give me the benefit of the doubt. You're the one who's taking shots at me. You always believe the worst of me.\"\nI said that I'd try to give her the benefit of the doubt in the future, but this situation felt like she was coming at me. She insists she was just trying to teach me how to have empathy.\nPart of me thinks this is one of those \"shoe's not so comfortable on the other foot,\" but I also feel these are different. I need some help sorting through if I'm the AH.\n\nEdit:\n\nAdding in the following because a lot of people have been asking about it. I couldn\u2019t include it because of the character limit. \n\nThe get together this weekend is my brothers wedding. I am standing in it and our daughter is the flower girl. We didn\u2019t get a schedule of when we were supposed to be where until earlier this week, and we keep getting hit with last-minute additions of places to be. I have told my family that we can\u2019t be at some of them because that\u2019s too short notice and we need a break, but we will be at others. \n\nShe was venting because we didn\u2019t get the schedule of when to be where until a day or two before the fight (about 5 days before the wedding), and because things kept getting added last minute.

That\u2019s not a healthy relationship at all.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why everyone thinks the wife\u2019s call was appropriate. If she was upset by the first conversation, the next step was an adult conversation about how two spouses can respectfully signal overwhelm. Calling and throwing words back is not communication or problem solving, nor is it \u201cteaching\u201d someone empathy. IMO, asking to be treated respectfully but failing to provide respect back is a major red flag.\n\nI almost put ESH for the hang up, but I also think ending the conversation was smarter than trying to hash it out while in traffic. The more I thought about it, the more of an AH wife seems for pushing the issue in that way at that time.", "NTA. Probably needed to be in OP that the situation with family was already resolved and nothing left to do there and it was just venting because that's a popular point of confusion.\n\nAlso the situations were absolutely not the same. It would be equivalent if you asked her what was wrong in the first instance and then shut down the response. Her baiting you by asking first what's wrong is setting up a shot on purpose. Counseling for communication might be helpful for you two.", "NTA. She might not realize it, but she\u2019s gaslighting you. You listened to the issue she had, then said, \u201chey, that\u2019s all I can handle of that for now.\u201d You didn\u2019t shut her down. You listened to what she had to say, then set a boundary. Maybe you could have said something like, \u201cthat\u2019s all I can handle on that at the moment. Can we discuss it more later?\u201d Then, of course, you have to make sure there comes a time later when you\u2019re ready to discuss it.\n\nThen the next day, she knowingly asked you a question that was going to have a \u201cnegative\u201d response, and shut you down to \u201cteach you a lesson in empathy\u201d. That is not okay. You said she was taking a shot at you, which she was, and she turned it around on you. That\u2019s gaslighting. Her denial that she was taking a shot, and instead \u201cteaching you a lesson\u201d is disingenuous. \n\nIt sounds like you two have some big challenges with being busy and having stressful family stuff. It can get heated sometimes. You could have worded things differently, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong here.", "NTA - the middle of traffic is not the time to play games. What\u2019s she thinking? \u201cLet me see if I can frustrate my husband more while he\u2019s driving, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s not going to put anyone in danger.\u201d \n\nIf she had a problem with the previous conversation, then she should have waited until you got home to talk about it. It was appropriate for you to hang up because you should be focusing on driving and not having a distracting, upsetting argument.", "Sounds like you also have poor communication skills. Validating her for her frustration but then changing the subject isn\u2019t really anything. You could have offered a solution like \u2018I\u2019ll call them up and find out what\u2019s what.\u2019 But instead, you acknowledged it and then changed the subject.\n\nThen you found yourself in a frustrating situation, and she called you out. And you hanging up was a tantrum because she showed you how hypocritical you were being. \n\nYTA", "Nta", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nPeople saying you have poor communication and poor empathy skills are not analysing this story correctly. You very clearly communicated you were not in a position to listen to your S.O. shit talk your family, you were clearly exhausted and you communicated that. That shouldve been the end of it.\nHanging up was probably the best outcome from that situation. It was that or a fight by the sounds of it - and considering you were already aggrivated and driving, cutting off another source of potential road rage (and increased likelihood of an accident) was the right thing to do. Yeah, it would piss off your wife, but she called with the clear intent to take a shot at you (teaching you a lesson or whatever way you spin it, it was intended to upset you in a form of petty revenge) because she was still upset about the night before - which demonstrates that she doesnt have the best communication skills regarding her own feelings.\nMy partner and I have been together over 2 years and never had an argument. We have gone through the exact same scenario where one needs to vent and the other isnt in a position to hear it. We communicate that and we decide to just relax, cuddle and watch something on tv until we have calmed down a bit. We certainly did not throw a tantrum at each other for postponing the venting session until we were both ready to hear it.\nAt the end of the day, youre both human. If your wife was stressed and had no output, then yeah a lot of people would end up lashing out like she did. You aren't some emotional sponge capable of taking on everything at any time either, you needed peace in that moment and it was not respected.\nAgain, NTA. Hopefully it was just a 1 off due to lots of stress and tiredness. You are both allowed to be at your limit, and people can lash out because of that. Finding a way to reduce that tiredness and stress would be the best way to improve the health of your relationship going forward.", "ESH, \"throwing it back in your face\" isn't exactly a great response and you both did it. You can't shut your wife down for venting frustrations unless you never vent frustrations. You also can't constantly go \"tit for tat\" because you'll both just end up resenting each other. You both need an upgrade in communication skills, but you definitely started it.", "It sounds like you and your wife both need to prioritize being kind to each other. \n\nWhen you feel exhausted, it\u2019s hard to listen to someone\u2019s problems. It takes energy to have empathy. \n\nI can\u2019t tell you how to prioritize being kind to your spouse, because I\u2019m not a couple\u2019s therapist. But I can tell you that you must be kind to each other if you want the marriage to succeed. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s time for some professional guidance and perspective. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You're working alot of hours and drained and it's not unreasonable to request one night of stress free, positive talk.  I think you acknowledged her and then respectfully asked to basically rest with her.  Her reaction was really immature.\n\n However, you noticed that the issue was still left open, and I'm curious when or if you were planning to come back to it.  If you ask a spouse to table a problem that is on their mind, and you clearly see it's bothering them then you have to be willing to come back to it later.   Are you tye type that does that? Or are you the type that says \"let's talk about this later\" and then just wait for her to explode.  There is no way for me to know which one.  On one hand, her reaction suggests it could be a typical problem. On the other it could just be her being immature. \n\nIf you need to table something that is bothering your spouse my best advice is to tell her WHEN you'll discuss it.  Then follow through enough times that she believes it when it happens. Ex:  \"you're completely right. I'm stressed about my family too.  I want to talk about it wirh you but I'm not in the right headspace right now. Can we relax for a couple hours and then come back to it before bed?\"", "Her attempts at teaching you empathy are pathetic and yes she was taking a shot at you, no matter how she tries to.dress it up.\n\nI actually just kind of agree with you in all this, the last thing someone wants hear at the end of a terrible day, is how terrible their family is. Like...Read the room.", "NTA\u2026 like at all.\n\nYour wife sounds insufferable. Does she ever take responsibility for anything?", ">I said I know my family's communication skills are poor\n\n\nLooks like you inherited it too.\n\n\nYTA", "She was definitely taking a shot lol", "There are some y..t..a votes in here that I can't imagine came from grown adults. \"Can we talk about something more positive,\" is communication. It's one person telling the other they have reached their capacity for a given topic. \n\n*Asking someone* to tell you whats wrong then cutting them off to intentionally make them feel bad, is not communication. It's an attempt to hurt someone on purpose to make a point. \n\nYou expressed your feelings and accidentally hurt your wife; your wife hurt you on purpose to make a point. These are not equal. NTA.", "Wife, \"my ferling matter. Yours don't\"\n\nNTA", "NTA How do people not see the difference between a situation organically happening and one that the wife completely initiated??", "I'm going to go against the grain and say, NTA. It is okay that you didn't have the patience or emotional capacity to deal with your wife's burdens in that moment, you have your own needs and limits. \n\nYour wife clearly waited for an opportunity to take a shot at you with that statement, and is now gaslighting you to try to get you to believe she was \"teaching you empathy.\" Horseshit. Your wife sounds super manipulative.", "yes you did something wrong but it wasn't on purpose. your wife hurt you on purpose to make her point instead of just communicating like an adult. NTA or maybe e s h", "NTA-A lot of people on this sub agree with his wife being petty and childish? He told her, hey can we not talk about this right now? He didn't get rude he just said he wasn't in the mood for a conversation. Is that wrong? No, he can say not right now, and not be a dick. It's not like he told her never discuss it, he wanted a break. Jeez.", "NTA, but you really need to work on communication skills. Not just you, but also your wife. Her reactions are....not okay.", "NTA she absolutely took a shot at you. She was pissy because once you had enough of her venting and negativity after a very long day and wanted to talk about something happier she didn't like that because she wanted to be the center of attention and have her emotional needs met while yours weren't even a consideration. She showed no empathy for you and is trying to twist it around and make you the bad guy. She doesn't want to be accountable for her poor actions. She acted like a brat who didn't get her way.", "Your wife is an asshole and she's being facetious at this moment. It is two VERY separate things to let her bash your family to your face (after a rant fest about her job. How often does she do both?) and to complain about general traffic (during an otherwise regular conversation). You know it, she knows it, we all know it. \n\nShe absolutely asked laid a trap to be vindictive, and now that you're actually trying to call her out on it, is DARVOing you.\n\nShe isn't listening when you say you're feeling attacked, isn't being self reflective on why you called her negative in the first place, and instead is issuing threats that she can get So Much Worse, so you should accept your lesson like a good boy before she escalates. \n\nNTA, but since she says communication skills are lacking, call her on it by scheduling some marriage counseling. Where you can clearly communicate that 1) you would appreciate it if she didn't not bash your family, and 2) her doing stuff like this doesn't teach you empathy, it just makes you not like talking to her.", "You\u2019re being completely gaslit by your wife. It\u2019s ok to have boundaries and it\u2019s ok to let her know you aren\u2019t able to give her the space she needs. She then baited you and gaslit you even further. She sounds exhausting. \n\nNTA", "Seems like your wife just enjoys fighting. NTA.", "Uhm... I would say YTA\n\nLook I get it can sometimes be overbearing ect... she wants to talk to you and wants you to listen when she's trying to get something off her shoulders...\nI get that you might not be in te mood... but hey, sometimes she might also not be in the mood, yet sucks it up... so, I'd say work on communicating, from your side as well... \nShe did give you \"your own medicine\" when you wanted to vent about something that bothers you, yet you expected her to understand and be fine with it, but when the tables are turned- you hang up on her...", "NTA. \n\nShe calls it \"teaching you empathy\" you call it \"taking a shot\" but it is really the same thing. She admits she wasn't genuinely asking you about your day/if you were upset, she was asking it to teach you a lesson. That is hurtful and uncalled for, and you don't need to give her the benefit of the doubt when she herself admits she set you up to teach you something. That's not genuine and caring, so it's ironic she did it to teach you \"empathy.\"\n\nYour wife is using a lot of terminology but not a lot of actual communication. She also doesn't get to tell you how you should react in every situation in precise ways. She was rude to you, you hung up. Just as the night before when she felt you were rude, she walked away. \n\nI need you to hear this- her saying \"I was doing it to teach you empathy\" means she was absolutely baiting you, she just wants to call it by a different name, but the intent and harm is the same. \n\nAnd by the way, it is perfectly reasonable for you to ask for a conversation to be put on hold or that you aren't in the frame of mind to hear it right now. Sure, if your partner comes home upset and needs to work through something, then you should try your hardest to do so, but even then you can also include your own feelings and needs in it. But needing help or emotional support isn't the same as needing to \"vent\" about a standing issue where there is no solution to work through. You can ask for a pause or to end a discussion that is just the same old venting session with no resolution.", "This started out as yta, went to esh, then ended off as nta.

For real?", "NTA as someone who gets frustrated and overstimulated easily because of adhd, my husband knows how I can get and sometimes he may lose his cool but he\u2019s understanding 99.9% of the time. She wasn\u2019t teaching you empathy but trying to be kinda hostile towards you. Which I get because again I get that way too. But she needs to use her big girl words and tell you how you made her feel instead of trying to make you more upset.", "YTA for expecting your wife to be the one to handle your family when they lack communication skills, then also not giving her space to vent about how difficult it is for her. If you don't want to hear her vent, you should step up and organize your own family so she has nothing to vent about. But don't be surprised if she doesn't want to hear *you* vent about how frustrating that is since you weren't willing to return the favor.", "NTA\n\nYou asking to talk about something more positive -especially when complaining about someone else\u2019s family which can already be a touchy subject- was your way of communicating your needs.

Can you elaborate about why she was upset? \n\nIt sounds like the mental load of having to figure out weekend plans is falling on your wife. She is frustrated because your family is not doing a good job of communicating. This isn\u2019t new, this is an ongoing issue. Your response is to listen for a few minutes and then tell her you want to talk about something more positive. \n\nA few things here:\n\n-your wife seems to be the one to manage weekend plans. This has become her task in the relationship. Is this by default or through a conscious decision on both your parts that she will take on this task? \n\n-Your family has a history of being poor communicators. She is frustrated. Have you talked with your family about it? What have you done to address it? Or does this fall on your wife\u2019s shoulders because she\u2019s the one who makes plans?\n\n-You want to talk about things that are more positive that build you up. Ok, like, your wife is seriously frustrated about this and you turn this into \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk about it because it brings me down.\u2019 It\u2019s dismissive and demeaning. I don\u2019t get the impression that you are recognizing or acknowledging the work and effort she is putting forth to figure out logistics to get together with your family. This issue has clearly happened before and you blow it off as just one of those things. Instead of helping her figure out how to resolve it or offering to take on the responsibility of talking to your family, you make this about yourself and how this is bringing down the vibe.\n\n-There is a difference between her \u2018bashing on your family\u2019 and having frustrations about trying to make plans. You labeling it as her bashing on your family for minutes on end side steps the underlying issues. Maybe she really does not like your family - that seems unlikely though as she is the one making plans to meet up with them.\n\nIt seems like the issue is much deeper here - she is trying to make plans with your family. They are being vague or non-communicative. When she brings it up to you, you brush it off instead of offering to talk to them.\n\nEdited to add YTA.", "Nta, i believe you need to both get relieved feom all that stress so that you have more empathy for each other.", "I\u2019m torn between N A H and E S H and N T A. \n\nYou guys have a lot going on. \n\nI guess what tips it for me is that your wife tried to \u201cgotcha\u201d you at a time and in a way that was almost guaranteed to provoke rather than open any sort of constructive conversation. \n\nAnd to me that is asshole behaviour. She ASKED you. It\u2019s really normal and healthy to set a limit on offloading annoyance and stress.

Your wife needs to stop focusing on your family's communication skills, and work on her own. I have been in her shoes, where I resented my husband's family and pointed out every single flaw.

We've had it where they were waffling about meeting (locally) and didn't pick a time until the day before and we couldn't make it because we had a prior commitment. Several times we have left by a certain time in the evening (because it was not planned for overnight) and my Uncle was REALLY upset we weren't going to get dinner with them. We have to get home to the animals so we just skip dinner or grab something on the road. You have to gently set boundaries and they will improve.

I see why she may have tried to use that moment to have you examine how you would feel had she chosen to respond how you had. Timing was bad. She could have waited until you had finished, got home and put a little space in there to communicate that. I wonder WHY she chose then though.

I'm sorry it's been so stressful.\"), and asking if there's anything you can do or offering a solution you can do later (\"is there anything I can do to help?\" Or \"I can reach out to them in the morning and find out more info.\"), and then offering something that works for both of you when you're both too stressed to have a full conversation about it (\"I know we've both had a long day.

And that part of your feelings are knowing she was being a little \u201ctaste of your own medicine\u201d. \n\nAND I think a lot of your feelings are the exact feelings she had when you said it to her for exactly the same reason. \n\nI also observe two things\u2026\n\n1. She says you lack empathy multiple times and you haven\u2019t denied that. Do you have low empathy/struggle with empathy? (Judgement free, humans have variable levels of empathy and it\u2019s not a measure of their value etc\u2026) \n\n2. She says you always take what she says/does from the worst point of view and you say you\u2019ll try to work on that - so to me that seems like a thing you tend to do, yes?\n\nThat combo - struggling to see tubs from someone else\u2019s perspective as just as true as your own perspective Plus a defensiveness that seeks to put the blame/accusation on others rather than have to sit with a process negative feelings\u2026 that can be REALLY hard on the other partner. From her perspective if you hurt her she will never get an acknowledgment or apology, and if you do anything wrong she can never address it with you because you\u2019ll automatically turn it on her. Dealing with all that is emotionally exhausting. \n\nI don\u2019t think you are an AH if both these things are true, we all develop these things subconsciously\u2026 But now that you are here, talking to us about it, it\u2019s a good time to think about if those things *are true* in how you respond to interpersonal conflict. \n\nCan you hear criticism of you without defending yourself as if from personal attack? (My husband really struggles with this so I get it.) Do you tend to make what your wife says and does rise than anything you said it did? THESE are the things that you\u2019ll need to think and talk about to help improve your communication. \n\nWhat I would say about this incident is that it\u2019s ok for both things to be true. And I\u2019d start by apologizing. \u201cI\u2019ve thought about it and realize that part of why I was hurt was cause yeah, having you not want to hear me was hurtful and I\u2019m sorry I said that to you\u2026.\u201d BTW this is also your opportunity for talking about how to say: \u201cI want to be heart for you but right now I just don\u2019t have the energy/ability for a vent session can we talk about simmering lighter now and return to that in a bit?\u201d In a way that works for both of you and both of you can use it. And after the apology and *time to talk about how she felt* say, \u201calso, it did feel like your timing was motivated by wanting me to hurt a bit in the same way. And that part hurts too\u2026 I\u2019d rather we find a way to talk about these things than poke at each other.\u201d\n\nThe truth is you both fucked up and no one needs to have fucked up more than the other so only one of you is responsible.

You won't always be able to listen to her vent when she needs to vent. This is a boundary you need to draw.  It is a healthy boundary.  There is a better way to draw this boundary and it should be a discussion between the Two of you. She can still vent, she just needs to vent to a friend or to journal or to find another release sometimes rather than relying on you all the time. You need a break sometimes.  And that's ok. The better option is for you to tell her when you come home that you're extra tired and had a rough day and you're not up for venting.

She should not have done this while you were upset and driving. That was inappropriate and an AH move.   She is allowed to be upset. She needs to sit down and talk to you when you are both calm.

Then I would ask her if you can share your *feelings* about what happened too, and do so calmly and without attaching any judgmental language or intent to them (\"When you say [blank] I feel [feeling]\" vs \"you attacked me\" or \"you made me feel\"). Then I would try to talk about strategies you can employ to avoid the escalation.

My go-to is usually \"I'm sorry, but I don't think I have the stability you need right now. Can I at least offer you some funny cat gifs?\"", "Probably the best response here. At the end of the day, it takes people a long time to learn how to communicate properly to their SO. One of the best things I learned years ago is that turning it into a competition of who was the bigger AH when you know BOTH of you fucked up NEVER helps. Is it possible one of you was the bigger AH? Sure. Will one of you admitting that aomehow make it better? No, not really. How about everyone admitting they handled things poorly and agree to communicate better in the future? I don't know a single person who'd be happy if their partner basically told them, \"I'm tired of listening to you complain.\" And whether that's what OP said or meant, that's clearly how she took it. And honestly, the \"build me up\" wording was kind of...ew. I also don't know anyone who likes, as an adult, being taught a lesson, even a sorely needed one. \n\nAt the end of the day, you were hurt by what she said and did, the same way she was hurt by what you said and did. Were the contexts exactly the same? No. But you still hurt each other in a similar way over similar reasons. From her perspective, OP, you were dismissive and made it about you and your feelings while she was venting about an ONGOING issue. She then, in turn, took the first opportunity to ASK you how it would feel if she did the same, and before she EVEN had a chance to do that, you were hurt by the mere implication she was going to do just that. It doesn't have to be a 1 for 1 comparison to be relevant to the fact that you both suck at communicating, you both hurt each other's feelings in a moment of objective selfishness, and neither of you wants to admit fault.\n\nNow, if these \"lessons\" are something she does OFTEN, that's a HUGE red flag and not to be taken lightly. That's where the difference would be for me. Is this the first time she's ever done something like this? I get the urge to throw a partner's behavior back in their face. I think everyone has had those little moments of \"victory\" when they can do so organically in a relationship. But manufacturing those moments or straight up looking for them, no matter how tempting or even justified it feels, is manipulative, period. \n\nOP, ask yourself something: Has your wife ever asked you to stop being negative and lift her up mid-vent, or does she usually let you get it all out? How often do you get to vent and she doesn't or vice versa? If this was a one-off, something like this doesn't happen out of the blue. If she doesn't normally do things like this, then clearly, there is an underlying, possibly ongoing issue that isn't being addressed. Historically, does talking it out work for you two, or is it just a bandaid? If talking isn't historically a fix in your relationship, she might have felt, however misguided, that a demonstration was the next best course of action. \n\nThese are all assumptions and general questions, not accusations. I can only go based on personal experience in learning to communicate better. It's honestly hard. People get defensive very easily when they feel their character is being questioned. I learned the hard way, NEVER to assume others perceive things how you do. You might be bewildered thinking you said and did everything right, but the other person is still mad or hurt. It could be a simple matter if they are perceiving the situation completely differently than you. Getting their perspective and at least attempting to understand it helps go a long way in communication. Maybe they misinterpretted something you said, i.e. \"I don't want to hear anymore negativity today. Let's build me up.\" This can easily be perceived as \"I'm tired of listening to you whine, let's talk about me.\" Especially to someone already in a sour mood. \n\nPeople forget, someone already in a shit mood, it's really not hard to make that mood 10000x worse by saying the wrong thing, as you well discovered, OP, especially when you thought the person who made it worse would be \"on your side\" so to speak.\n\nETA: typos fixed", "\"weekend plans\" are his brother's wedding.

If someone is not in the mood to hear your bitching then they have no obligation to listen to it. Even your SO.

You weren't rude about it, you just said can we discuss something else right now. That's completely reasonable.\n2.

Nobody has to sit there and listen to someone just spout negativity if they aren't in the space to deal with that shit. Yes, you are supposed to let your SO vent to you but you don't suddenly become shackled to every tirade they feel like going on when they get irritated. He has just as much right to vent as she does.

She was not receptive to his emotional needs and then tried to weaponise them when she directly asked him what was going on. That is emotional manipulation, and terrible communication, it doesn't acknowledge his situation or needs and in thst position I would have shut down the conversation too, as being \"taught a lesson\" like that while already in a state of stress is just uncalled for, sometimes it's best to park a conversation until you are in a better position to handle it.

Sure, his family is poorly communicating, sure it's an ongoing issue, sure it needs to be addressed and sure he should probably be the one to address it. But how does griping about your spouse's family to your spouse for minutes on end fix it? It's just hurtful. And asking that \"may we change the subject, this is just upsetting me,\" is a *really* reasonable request, and if OP described the request accurately, it was expressed respectfully.\n\nAnd a lot of what OP is relating about his wife's \"communication style\" reeks of belittlement, manipulation, weaponization of OP's own words. Not just \"you don't have empathy\" but \"I was trying to *teach* you empathy,\" by trashing OP's family and insisting that he's captive to it...?? Or by asking why he's upset and then, instead of engaging with that, inserting last night's argument by spitefully mocking his prior request to change the subject...?? And I think OP's assessment that she was trying to prompt OP to make a complaint in order to be punishing and vindictive saying \"can we talk about something more positive?\" Hun, you asked why I sounded upset. If you didn't want to know, you didn't need to ask. She was absolutely looking for fight and a way to be hurtful. I would have hung up, too. She wasn't being reasonable or respectful, you can't reason with unreasonable people, and maybe OP shouldn't have hung up, but I would have ended the conversation abruptly, too, one way or another.\n\nShe wanted to be mean, hurtful, and spiteful, and she wanted OP captive to it. And I suspect that's why OP hanging up upset her so much. Sure, it was disrespectful. But she wasn't being respectful and what she's actually mad about is that he wasn't captive to her abusive language and accusations anymore. \n\nShe sounds like the sort of person who doesn't like to be contradicted or told 'no.' And if it were that alone, it would be annoying at worst. But she was contradicted and told 'no,' in an appropriate, respectful way. And her response is to: be vindictive and deliberately hurtful, employ therapy speak to manipulate and justify her intentionally mean, spiteful behavior, and not only accuse her spouse of lacking empathy, but to then insist her intentionally mean, spiteful behavior was a *teaching moment, actually.*\n\nOP and his family might be poor communicators, but wife's communication style is a full-on red flag for bullying and emotional and verbal mistreatment.\n\nEdit for typos and clarity", "No. She baited him.\n\nSituation 1- she vents, he listens, gets tired, asks her to stop. \n\nSituation 2- she asks him to vent, he starts, she does her dumb stunt.

I like to think of it as being open hearted in conversations.\n\nFir example, in the first situation you could have said \u201cI hear you. I am feel very tired. Is there something specific you want me to do or is it ok to change the subject?\u201d. Telling how you feel, while acknowleding her side.\n\nIn the second situation. Boy, it\u2019s hard. Did you feel hurt, betrayed, frustration? Those ARE big feeling. And I kinda get not wanting to deal with them while actively being in a traffic jam. So maybe the time to mention those feelings would have been when you got home. I also get kinda why you were defensive instead. You didn\u2019t trust your partner to be open hearted towards you when she had just tricked you, that feels bad. \n\nBut still coming home and saying \u201cBabe, I felt really hurt. I hear you, you wanted me to have empathy. Can you see that I am coming and showing how I am vulnerable right now? Meet me half way. Help me understand, how did you feel yesterday, when I didn\u2019t listen?\u201d.  And then youlisten without interupting. And without defending yourself. If needed you could say something like \u201cI hear you. The way you are talking about my family makes me feel less worthy, like I am from a shitty family, but I love them. Can you talk about them without calling them names?\u201d\n\n\nI was in a similar kind of relationship woth my partner, couple years ago.

Eventually, if they don't, the marriage just becomes stress and obligations and eventual implosion.", "I think this is what the posters are missing. A person who is 'out of spoons' is by definition, stretched thin. They probably aren't going to sit there and formulate the exact Therapist\u2122 recommended phase to use to avoid any and all discomfort. OP sounds like he did the best he had with the mental bandwidth he had, saying he understands his family is annoying and that he'd love to be spending time with her. People on AITA love to act like their hindsight is their foresight.", "She's a major AH. And hiscrewuest thevdst before to talk about something mire positive was fine, imo. Her freak out because she needed him to vent to is HER problem. If he didn't gave the bandwidth to deal at the moment? He didn't have it. So what. Wife needs to grow the fuck up. NTA.", "Honestly, it sounds like you both need to work on your communication. I have found that couples therapy has been amazing for my wife and I to do better with communication. Especially if you go into it with the perspective of \u201cwe\u2019re doing this to improve our communication together\u201d and not \u201cone of us is wrong and needs to be fixed.\u201d Planning on doing it together and that both of you can improve helps you get started faster because you\u2019re working together instead of spending time trying to assign blame.", "Sorry. For context, every time the OP tried and failed something, without fail, their wife would say, \"You were SO close.\" But insist that it was meant in a supportive and encouraging way rather than condescending, eventually OP got really used to hearing it. She was apparently working hard for a LONG time to get a promotion at work and was completely devastated when they chose someone else. Without thinking, OP used her favorite catchphrase without any malicious intent but rather because she had normalized it to the point that was what first came to mind when trying to console her. She got pissed and left for OP saying it. Which imho, was her telling on herself that she actually wasn't being \"encouraging\" or \"supportive\" because why else would she be pissed?", "It sure seems that way", "Thanks for reminding me. I\u2019m paying a lot of attention to the comments that seem well thought out and have a lot of effort put into them. It\u2019s helped me a lot try to figure out where I can grow.\n\nStill tough to hear the \u201cyou deserved what you got\u201d comments though because those moments hurt, because at first I thought she cared about my frustrations in the moment when she asked what was bothering me, but the message I heard was \u201cshe doesn\u2019t care about my feelings here, she just wants to score a hit.\u201d\n\nA better response would have been \u201cthat hurt, I didn\u2019t like it, we\u2019ll talk when I get home.\u201d I like to think I\u2019ll say that in the future, but in the moment it\u2019s hard to say everything perfectly.\n\nThanks for weighing in.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. To be honest, if the roles were reversed, more people would be shouting this message given the trend I\u2019ve seen in the responses that tend to show up here. It feels like just because OP is male that people don\u2019t seem to think that. He stated that she had already been venting about her day prior to starting to vent (again) about his family\u2019s lack of communication. A frustrating situation, yes, I think we can all agree on that. That being said, him asking, after letting her vent, then agreeing with her, to talk about something more pleasant was actually a good form of communication on his behalf. He maybe could have said \u201cbuild us up\u201d instead of \u201cme\u201d but that\u2019s an easy thing to fix. He still was trying to explain what he wanted and why. She got offended cause he didn\u2019t want to just keep letting her go off. \nNext day, while talking on the phone, she comments that he sounds upset & asks why. So he answers and she pulls the stunt. A parent doesn\u2019t teach a child empathy that way. That\u2019s a good way to teach a kid that they shouldn\u2019t bother to tell you anything that\u2019s bothering them. OP isn\u2019t a kid. She was trying to get back at him plain & simple. Then she tried to turn it around on him when he told her how it seemed to look like & sound and imply the fault was actually his (gaslighting). OP is NTA. But the rest of you blaming him are. So is OPs wife.", ">He said one thing about being annoyed\n\nAlso, he only said that one thing because she asked, not because he wanted to vent.", "There's a big difference between telling someone you just can't listen to them complain right now and commiserating and working together to find a more positive situation.", "If your bandwidth is already low enough you don't have the energy to spell that shit out either."]}
