Simply because I don't want to deal with saying \"oh I'm part French on this side, and a bit British by way of Wales, and don't forget the Trinidadian Portuguese\".\n\nI'm sorry that people made dumb jokes to you, and that sucks. But I wouldn't fight with my partner about it.", "Right? He'd rather hear jokes about snails and frog legs", "I\u2019m Mexican in a MAGA part of the country. I brace every time I say my last name. I understand the concept. \n\nBut I\u2019ve heard plenty of derogatory jokes about Polish people and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really our place to question if he\u2019s actually experienced this or not. \n\nWhy I asked OP is because I think it\u2019s important to know if his wife understands why he feels uncomfortable bringing up that he\u2019s Polish. Because for me, where my partner comes from really doesn\u2019t matter and if he fibs a bit to protect himself from a stranger, I would find that incredibly sad but perfectly ok. Because he doesn\u2019t owe any information to anyone", "Yes I clearly have no idea what I'm talking about. I am NEVER involved in the conversations about my family history. NO ONE EVER Keeps bringing it up and you know everything about what happens to me.", "Thanks!", "I tell people I'm american. When they ask where my family is from I just tell them I'm a mudblood. That usually shuts the conversation down pretty quite but the few times it hasn't I just tell them I never knew most of my family and that their guess is as good as mine", "In case you need clarity. Y is a vowel, sometimes W and R can be vowels.", "He\u2019s literally not being stubborn about *nothing*. Have you never been discriminated against??", "Douglas Adams and 42 came about the same way, he likes to claim he was on the Toilet but it is Douglas Adams and he would add that detail for flair.", "Haha they do NOT like it when I tell them I'm American.  And then tell them what state I'm from if they persist.  But I do it anyway because seriously...!", "No y w or r 3 Z's tho", "Yes. One of the upsides of being Jewish when your grandfather is a survivor.\n\nYou learn all about discrimination and dumb jokes.", "In my experience as a slav, the letters I told you are sometimes vowels are sometimes vowels.", "Okay, so imagine one day you got fed up with hearing antisemitic comments from randos and decided to start hiding your background but your significant other made a big point of outing you against your wishes every time you met anyone new. Do you really think you\u2019d be the asshole for asking them to stop?", "Okay. There are none of those in her last name was all I was saying. It's still 9 letters 1 O in the whole thing", "Honestly? Hearing a Polish joke in any context isn't really the same as antisemitism. \n\nI'm sure it gets exhausting but no one is rounding up the poles. \n\nAnd again, I didn't say he had to go around waving a Polish flag and throwing perogies at people.\n\nWhat I did say is he's being stubborn. It actually doesn't matter, other than being mildly irritating, and there are options that wouldn't piss off his (asshole of a) wife. \n\nInstead he's digging in his heels and causing a fight.", "Now I'm curious.", "I agree that it\u2019s not the same, but that\u2019s the closest analogue I can come up with on the spot to your own heritage. \n\nWhy should OP continue to be\u2014in your wording\u2014*exhausted* when a simple white lie (that\u2019s not even that much of a lie) lets them avoid that situation entirely? Why is it SO important that their wife be allowed to butt in and say \u201cACTUALLY, OP is Polish\u201d every single time when she *knows* it might cause problems for OP? \n\nAt the end of the day OP has asked \u201cplease don\u2019t do this because it hurts me\u201d and the wife has replied \u201cabsolutely not\u201d. She\u2019s being completely insensitive. OP is NTA."]}
