I'm sure I'll be dowvoted for this, but until you've been in this situation, don't judge the significant other for being upset the person they fell in love with physically changed.

This happens with both men and women (though I think internet denizens are less likely to call out a woman) and it is often taken as a sign that the significant-other isn't \"dating\" them anymore. That can definitely be a concerning thing! Wouldn't you be concerned if your spouse wasn't treating you and courting the same as when you were first dating? In this instance, it sounds like that's exactly what's happening: girlfriend found a guy that likes her enough to keep at it for 3 years and decided (though perhaps sub-consciously) she doesn't have to watch her weight anymore.

OPs friend needed to be confronted because you can't fix anything if your in denial there is a problem.\n\nYou assume people making these judgments haven't been in those situations, and thats not true. I've been on both sides. When a person I loved told me that he wasnt as attracted to me because \"people ask what happened to the skinny person i was dating last time and I have to tell them its you\" and he tried to dismiss it as 'just how he felt' and it pushed me deeper into depression until I realised being with someone like that is what was unhealthy. After I left him I stopped using the birth control method he had insisted I use (I gave in to the pressure) and suddenly I could lose weight again, plus I didn't have anyone undermining me or judging my progress. When I started dating someone else and years later they started gaining weight, it changed nothing about how attractive I found them. They were still the same person! We eventually broke up because they started lying, and that made me lose my attraction.\n\nMy partner now could gain 100lbs, or be in an accident, or get an illness that changed their appearance- and I'd still be as attracted to *them*.

Entirely anonymous, and while comments were enabled on every post, all commenters were assigned a generic icon/color, and the assignment changed from post to post. The posts you see in your feed were dependent on your location, and would tell you how far away the OP was (down to like \u00bc mile or something, but not enough to pinpoint anyone). It was kind of an exciting time, because it allowed people to say the things that they had never felt safe to say to anyone. Of course, eventually, it was overtaken and destroyed by horrible people, but before then, it was kind of magical.\n\nAnyway. One day, I posted about how my girlfriend had gained a significant amount of weight since we'd gotten together. We were in our mid-30s, and she was a pretty big woman when we first got together, so it's not like I was shameful or fatphobic. More like, change is hard, y'know? Just like James (my namesake!), I loved her, I loved our sex life, but her body was changing and somehow it was causing some negative emotions in me, which I can't even recall at this point. Brains are weird, and sometimes we have emotions about stupid shit. But this was *Secret*, and I could shout a thing out to the ether, in order to just\u2026let it go. My gf lived many miles away, so it's not like she'd see it in her feed and know it was me\u2026right?\n\nWell, her settings were broad enough that she did see it \u2014 which I expected \u2014 and it turns out, I have a fairly distinctive way of writing. A few days later, in the kitchen at her house, she awkwardly told me about this post she read on Secret. And even more awkwardly pointed out that it a particular\u2026voice\u2026to it. And asked if I was the one who had written it.\n\nAnd I couldn't lie to her, that would just be worse. So I told her, with abject sorrow and remorse, saying that it really wasn't about me not loving her body as it is now, but that change is sometimes hard, and brains sometimes do weird things. Society fucks us *all* up regarding body image, and regardless how much work I've done in my life to be better than all that shit, I cannot fool myself into thinking that I'm ever *done* doing that work. It's fucking hard, and sometimes we need to hit the pressure relief valve, and sometimes that inadvertently will hurt someone.\n\nWe weathered that storm rather beautifully, and I owe it all to her for being so emotionally attuned, communicative, and willing to look past the surface shit to see the person inside. From that point on, our relationship grew stronger, our sex life improved exponentially, and we're still together at nearly a dozen years. Not once in those years have I ever been uncomfortable having her on my arm, in any situation.\n\nBut the bottom line is, getting through a thing like that takes a certain amount of skills that are kind of rare in this world: compassion, self-awareness, empathy, tactful and nonviolent communication, high emotional IQ, restraint, humility, a willingness to be vulnerable, a readiness to admit where you were wrong, and a deep commitment to listen to the people you care about when they tell you you're being an asshole.\n\nAll of us are capable of all of those things. We just have to try. I hope James tries. Reasonable people may differ on whether it's important for his gf to be told about this.

The younger generations of males in Mauritania now see fattening negatively. \n\nOlder women called \"fatteners\" force the young girls to consume enormous quantities of food and liquid, inflicting pain on them if they do not eat and drink. One way of inflicting pain is to pinch a limb between two sticks. A six-year-old might typically be forced to drink 20 litres of camel's milk, and eat two kilos of pounded millet mixed with two cups of butter, every day. Although the practice is abusive, mothers claim there is no other way to secure a good future for their children. \n\nA similar practice is referred to in a folktale entitled \"The Tortoise with a Pretty Daughter\", collected in Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria (1910). The folklorist who wrote down the story explained the treatment of the \"pretty daughter\": \"The fatting house is a room where a girl is kept for some weeks before her marriage. She is given plenty of food, and made as fat as possible, as fatness is looked upon as a great beauty by the Efik people and Bahumono.\"\n\nI think \u201cfat phobia\u201d transcends colour.

Do you check with their doctor so you can know whether you need to be embarrassed to be seen in public with them? Maybe they have a medical condition they don\u2019t even know about, but all they ever hear is how shameful it is that they must be so lazy and disgusting. Sometimes there\u2019s just a really strong genetic predisposition that doesn\u2019t have a formal diagnosis.
