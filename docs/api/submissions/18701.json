They\u2019ve been together for almost 3 years but he has gotten increasingly unhappy. He asked me to get coffee yesterday so he can do some venting. It\u2019s okay I vent to him too. It\u2019s a cool perk of our friendship. \n\nWe were drinking our coffee and I was letting him talk and he brought up her weight pretty quickly. I admit she has gained significant weight since they began dating. I believe James said she\u2019s gone up 3 or so pants sizes. James was saying how he does love her, he finds her plenty attractive still, and enjoys bedroom time very much.  But then he started saying the problem is how it makes him look. He said he \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to be the guy with the heavy girlfriend\u201d and he hates when he goes out with groups of people and \u201cgirlfriend is the biggest girl there all the time\u201d. He says he\u2019s not really sure there\u2019s a good way for him to bring any of this up too. \n\nI got mad at what he was saying. His gf is one of the sweetest humans I\u2019ve ever met. I know she deals with some mental health irregularities as well that probably contribute to her inability to lose weight. I told James that he\u2019s a total asshole dickface and I didn\u2019t meet him to listen to him fat shame a wonderful woman. I thought the problems were deeper. \n\nI told him we were done and went home. He\u2019s blown up my phone half apologizing and half saying that I agreed to hear him vent so I can\u2019t get mad at what he\u2019s venting about.

I am attracted to him still, but his weight gain has definitely made me less attracted to him, and I worry about his long-term health. It's not an asshole thing, it's just how I feel, and I think people are entitled to their feelings like your friend. The way he worded it was wrong, and people saying he doesn't love her because of her weight gain is bull. I'm sure I'll be dowvoted for this, but until you've been in this situation, don't judge the significant other for being upset the person they fell in love with physically changed. It's not all about looks, but being physically attracted to your partner is important. I like a husky man.

Most of his friends didn't even know that he had a girlfriend. He would only let me come over when no one but is kids were there. We went out to eat and he would sit on the other side and play on his phone and not say anything to me. I wasn't allowed to hold his hand or talk to him in public places.

I am going to assume \"James\" would not be ok with a tall woman or a woman similar to his height. lol.\n\nMOre likely we are talking sizes 0, up to 2/4/6.  \n\nEither way, we are \\*not talking about health in any way, shape or form.  I doubt that girlfriend is even overweight. If she is, not by much.  Friend is an asshole, most women do NOT stay skinny like a teen for very long. Or not without pharmaceutical help.

Because I go 4-5 a week to the gym and eat healthy and we have the same interests. I am just saying that usually it's not just the looks but also what lifestyle you have. You know what I mean?

And if a man is going to continue to expect that from his woman, then he needs to maintain a similar level of fitness for himself. Just saying, Don\u2019t ascribe it to old age.

This unlocked an old memory. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m2WutlqBk0", "Some people can maintain that level of fitness, yes, although they still will not look like a college students. The proportion of fit people decreases as you get older, for a large variety of reasons. Hormonal changes, metabolism changes, giving birth, illness, injury, etc. Or just not wanting to spend hours at the gym when you're in your 40s with young children. Placing a high value on physical attraction is a recipe for disappointment in a long-term relationship. Bodies will change. The only part you can control is how you react to it. If it's not your body, your options are acceptance or breaking up. As someone much closer to 40 than 20, I can't imagine throwing out a good relationship based solely on physical changes.", "Lol.", "Excellent", "I never said they would look like a college student at 60 years old. I\u2019m just saying they can maintain a similar level of fitness.  And I already acknowledge that it gets more difficult, the older one gets.\n\nEating a healthy diet and spending an hour at the gym is not unreasonable. If you want that look, you have to work for it.\n\n\nJames is 24 and presumably his girlfriend is around the same age. They have been together for three years. There should not be too many physical changes over that time, especially for someone in their early 20s."]}
