My parents separated when I was a few months old, he remarried and I wouldn't really see him unless I was at my grandparents and he happened to show up. From what I remember I only ever felt resentment from him when I was younger, there wasn't anything fatherly about how he treated me. \nI didn't see any off them after my grandad died, I was 13 and when I met my partner at 16 I decided to reach out again. I first went to see my grandmother and from there met up with my dad again. \nWe saw eachother every few weeks. Fast forward a few years and my fiance and I are planning our wedding, I see my family frequently but only see my dad a few times a month. \nWe all get into the discussion of who will be giving me away, I wanted to keep both my parents happy so I'd decided that my brother who I had grown up with would be the one to give me away, I felt it was only right considering he is one of the only consistents in my life. \nThis obviously did not go down well with my dad's family, who are very proud of their \"image\" and they felt that if he didn't give me away it would be hurting it. I explained to everyone my reasoning but it cause alot of tension, my dad and step mother said they would pay for my wedding cake, my dad cousin makes cakes so they had hired her to make it along with 100 gingerbread men I wanted as favours. \nIn May, which was 3 months before my wedding, my dad's cousin messaged and said she would no longer be making my cake and we would have to find someone else as the situation (which she wasn't involved in) made her feel uncomfortable and she didn't want to upset my dad. \nI was very angry at this point, and knew this was my family interfering, they have a very \"we go together or we don't go down at all\" world, I blew up at them all and uninvited them to the wedding. At this point none of us were really talking anyway and they'd kept making digs at me here and there. \nMy wedding comes around and obviously none of them are there, it's been nearly 4 years now and I've kept the no contact. I now have a little boy, another on the way and I feel okay about the situation. \nI've just recently been thinking about it more, AITA?", "created_utc": 1678536564, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11oim85/aita_for_not_letting_my_dad_give_me_away/", "score": 115, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It will also solidify it for the rest of the family too (even though they all know he was an absent parent).  Also, I totally understand second guessing yourself all these years later, you\u2019re human and there is probably a part of you that wishes you had a closer relationship with him, but I think you made the right choice.", "NTA. They were worried about \u201cthe image\u201d of him not walking you down the aisle, but not the fact that he was a deadbeat to you? Best to keep people like this out of your kids lives. You don\u2019t owe them anything by the sounds of it.", "NTA. Their image isn't your problem. If he wanted to walk you down the aisle, then he should have stepped up and been a parent. It sounds like your brother deserved the honor. Stay no contact, and don't feel bad. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. The entitlement your absentee father felt was off the charts and you had every right to choose the person you wanted to give you away.  I'm glad you didn't allow yourself to be bullied into a decision you regretted.   \n\n\nAlso can I just add... what a wonderful gesture towards your brother. <3 I'm sure he must have been so honored. I know it must not feel like it considering the fallout it caused, but this is a feel-good story in disguise. You honored the person who was there for you and made an effort to be part of your life. That's good stuff. Embrace those feels.", "NTA. As a father myself I firmly believe that any privileges we have as parents are earned....starting with showing up in your child's life. Your dad didn't show up for much of it.  This pattern of selfishness is continued in his insistence on being the one to walk you down the aisle. You did the right thing. Do not feel guilty.", "No you are not - it seems like you have been kind and considerate. They act like your father should be completely forgiven, I think its the worst thing in the world that someone can be so selfish to bring a life into the world then abandon it ( you ). Now its your turn to abandon them - Make a new family be proud of how much better you do ! - It always surprises me how entitled people act and how little they think there actions impact others - again its your turn to impact them with your actions - Be Powerful", "NTA you had every right to choose your brother, your dad was not a consistent or reliable parent your entire life. And judging how they all cut you out for the last four years, I think you made the right decision.", "NTA, for every parent out there you need to reflect on what energy you put into your relationship with your child and how it will come back to you one day, good or bad.", "NTA\n\nThey made the choice that \"their image\" is of more importance then the bride.", "No, you were not the ah. Your father was not there for you when you needed him. Him and his wife can care about their public image all they want but the truth is, he wasn't there for you growing up. So , you were not the ah for choosing not to give you away at your wedding.", "NTA. But sometimes you can be NTA and still create a situation for yourself that was worse than what you started with. \n\nIt is perfectly reasonable and allowable for you to not want your father to walk you down the aisle for any reason, including the fact that you aren't close to him. But you can understand how his feelings would be hurt, right? That felt like a public slap in the face to him, even if he deserved it. \n\nAnd clearly it was wrong for his family to take sides on such a personal thing as this. \n\nIt sounds like you don't like that you are estranged from your father and his family? If he's a reasonably nice guy and the relationship has the potential to be non-toxic, it's not too late to reach out and develop a relationship.", "NTA. Keep it the way it is. Too hard to walk on eggs without a few cracking.", "NTA.\n\nYou did what you had to do. Did you and your dad have a talk after you made the decision to go with your brother?", "NTA, your father clearly did not want you in his life and now they want a say in your wedding?? like how do they even expect that? \n\n>we go together or we don't go down at all\n\nwell they went down together.  \nYour brother was there for you and it was only fair for him to be giving you away. \n\nThe rest of the family and your father didn't deserve you. They failed you, and it's their fault.  \nI hope you don't feel guilty about it or sad about it, it was not your fault and they deserved it. \n\nI hope you live a happy, successful and a long life.", "NTA.  Their image is not your problem.  There are, or should be, consequences to bringing a child into the world and then being a lousy parent to that child.  It\u2018s ridiculous that he apparently resented you for, what, existing as a child?   Like you got any say in that.", "NTA Any parent who can\u2019t show up in childhood doesn\u2019t have the right to even ask to give away their child at a wedding.", "NTA in any way. Those people were never your family. They don\u2019t deserve your love and time, OP.", "Am I the only one who hates the 'giving away' aspect of a wedding? You're a person, not a set of golf clubs.

Their image is more important to them than your happiness on your wedding day. NTA.", "NTA and good call uninviting them to your wedding. My daughter got married a few years ago, and her father was furious she didn't want him to walk her down the aisle. He was never very involved in her life unless it suited him, but still wanted to walk her down the aisle. She and her husband paid for the whole event, and she walked herself down the aisle as she is an independent woman and did not see herself as being her father's property. He sulked through the whole ceremony and through the evening and then called her selfish and a terrible daughter - he is now complaining because she no longer talks to him! \n\nA parent has a responsibility to do their best for their children, even if the parents are separated, and, if your father really cared about you, he would have accepted what you wanted and been there with a smile on his face - that's what being a good parent is - putting your children first.\n\nMy ex made our daughter cry on her wedding day - it was childish, spiteful and unnecessary - he should have put his hurt ego to one side and then would still have a relationship with her.\n\nWell done for making the right decision for you!!", "NTA", "Nta f them \u2026I know it hurts but you really don\u2019t need that in your and definitely not your kids life.", "Abandon a child?  No problem. \n\nAbandoned child has someone else walk her down the aisle? ***CRISIS!!!***\n\nNTA", "NTA their behavior is just yikes! My dad\u2019s extended family is like that. When the second wife got annoyed that the child from his first marriage still existed even after his mother (first wife) was dead, my dad\u2019s cousin farmed him out to various relatives. He never really had a home or a parent. But when he got married? They all turned out in droves to out on a good show in front of the community and his in laws. They claimed it was to make sure he had support and felt loved but damn, where were they all the years he was a kid and moving from relative to relative\u2019s house with no stability? Where were they when the dad decided letting his wife pretend he\u2019d never been married before was more important than that kid?\n\nI understand the guilt because that is a lot of people to disappear and not be able to speak to. But when you look at how much care they showed you? You were never really part of their family. They came together to protect others but never you. You deserve a life free of them.", "Golly, wouldn't it really suck if the image of the \"perfect family\" was ruined by someone's finger accidently saving the link to this post, the same hand somehow posting the link on social media, then OP would step back for a while to enjoy their married life of bliss? Gosh, that would just SUCK\n\nNTA", "I don't see how OP caused any situation. Father was absent most of the time, obviously didn't care, then feels entitled to walk her down the aisle (I'm assuming cause of patriarchal/conservative reasons) and then she should consider how she hurt his feelings by saying no?  How about he should consider that she's hurt because he didn't give a sh*t the whole time?"]}
