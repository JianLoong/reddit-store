Just be upfront about feeling ditched, acting as a 5th wheel, and how you want some real time with them and not their hook ups.", "NTA. You didn't enjoy the last trip with them as much as they did.

If it had been a one off with the guys, and they exchanged info to meet up again after the trip, that would be one thing, but to then invite them to other plans and therefore change the situation to something else completely, is unreasonable. Especially when they knew you were being exculded.\n\nI don't blame you one bit for not wanting to go. They already proved you don't matter, and that they'll selfishly make decisions, so why put yourself in that situation again? If they can't understand that, that's a THEM problem, NOT a YOU problem.", "NAH. To some people, \"girl's trip\" is about friendship (i.e. *the girls*). For others, it's about being with your girl friends while you go hunt down cute boys. I don't think either of this is superior to the other, but it sounds like you went into the trip with a different expectation than your cousin had.\n\nI don't think you're being childish, I think it's totally reasonable to back out now that you understand it's not the kind of girl's trip you imagined.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friends are being selfish and insensitive here. Your feelings are legit. And you are protecting yourself from another uncomfortable situation. Setup boundaries for yourself. If they can\u2019t understand how their actions made you feel then they;re not really your friends.", "NTA. There are 2 main types of women that go on Girls' Trips. One type goes on  the trip to hang with her gal pals, whether it's the Mimosa Brunch or just hanging out. The other type is often those who *say they want a Girls' Trip,* but the other \"Girls\" are kind of Plan B. They're really hoping to find a guy to hang out with.\n\n  You, my friend, were with the second type, and you were their Plan B.

I wouldn\u2019t be friends with them at all anymore if they did that to me.", " If someone cannot make a logical argument for their own point of view, then do not let them persuade you to go along with them based on pressure of berating you.", "Even if you were to make them promise not to do that again, it will happen.", "I once again never said that? lol\nI just hopes she gets a fun girl's trip which she can enjoy as well\nit was literally just a suggestion chill \ud83d\ude05 I even said she wouldn't be an A for canceling any plans", "NTA -  As long as your cancellation doesn't make it impossible for them to go you dont have to go on a vacation you dont want.
