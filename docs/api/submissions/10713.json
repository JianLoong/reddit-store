Perhaps with a bit of proper reassurance from them, you might feel differently about going.", "NTA if they do things like this once there is a big probability of them doing it again also its a trip you dont need to feel bad about not going on one with people who make you feel that way", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s up to you if you want to spend your time and money with them. Just be upfront about feeling ditched, acting as a 5th wheel, and how you want some real time with them and not their hook ups.", "NTA. You didn't enjoy the last trip with them as much as they did. Go on trips you'll actually enjoy--maybe even by yourself. And what's with this expectation that you go on trips with them every couple of months??", "Nta That really sucks and I'd take a gander your friend and cousin probably just wanna get laid", "NTA\n\nThey essentially hijacked your trip to  hang out with new boy toys the last time.  They'll do it again.  Don't pay towards this trip if you haven't already.  And tell them you aren't going.", "If you don't want to go, then don't go.  The reasoning doesn't matter.  Your cousin needs to learn how to accept \"No\" as an answer.  NTA.", "NAH Your friends are allowed to have their fun, and you're allowed to choose what you want to do.", "NTA\n\nthat is a really sucky situation to be in and I'm sorry that happened to you. if you feel as though you don't want to go anymore you have every right to and don't make them make you feel otherwise.", "I don't think anyone would be if they cancelled any trips or hangouts but I think it would be better to tell them your concerns and ask them to keep it as a girl's trip next time and go, maybe it will be different and you will enjoy it", "NTA- People change and so do you..Don't do things that dont make you  happy", "NTA but your cousin sure is for belittling your valid feelings.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t enjoy the last trip with them and have no obligation to go", "NTA if you aren't comfortable going on a trip that was originally ment for girls that they decided they wanted men to go on, it's your choice. It is not childish it's called looking out for yourself.", "NTA - You aren\u2019t being silly or childish. You are saving yourself from another uncomfortable situation where they magically bump into men.\n\nThey aren\u2019t complaining because they will miss you on the trip but because they will have yo split the hotel 2 ways instead of 3. Stick to your guns.\n\nThe only exception would be if you really wanted to go and you are willing yo do activities, meals, and excursions on your own. Then it won\u2019t matter who they are with.", "ESH: your friends suck for fundamentally changing the nature of the trip while you're on it. You suck for bailing without explanation.\n\nif you were unhappy that your cousin and her friend turned it into a couples weekend, say so. It is fair to say that you were uncomfortable, and that sort of weekend isn't what you're looking for.", "NTA\n\nYou do what makes you happy\nUnless they are going to not be able to go without you and you gave them a hard promise to go", "My girlfriend trip also I planned r/AmItheAsshole", "NTA. those types of situations suck, and your friends do too if they didn\u2019t take your feelings into account at all. they ruined the girls\u2019 trip and made you the 5th wheel, why would you want to go again?", "NTA\n\nIf it's a \"girl's weekend\" that's the way it should be. If it had been a one off with the guys, and they exchanged info to meet up again after the trip, that would be one thing, but to then invite them to other plans and therefore change the situation to something else completely, is unreasonable. Especially when they knew you were being exculded.\n\nI don't blame you one bit for not wanting to go. They already proved you don't matter, and that they'll selfishly make decisions, so why put yourself in that situation again? If they can't understand that, that's a THEM problem, NOT a YOU problem.", "NAH. To some people, \"girl's trip\" is about friendship (i.e. *the girls*). For others, it's about being with your girl friends while you go hunt down cute boys. I don't think either of this is superior to the other, but it sounds like you went into the trip with a different expectation than your cousin had.\n\nI don't think you're being childish, I think it's totally reasonable to back out now that you understand it's not the kind of girl's trip you imagined.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
