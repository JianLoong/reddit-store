The main issue is S makes these comments neither I nor my boyfriend like about him and a coworker named M(21f).\n\nEveryone knows me and my Bf, let\u2019s call R, are dating, and we live together. These are things that my bf has come up to me and told me, and has been confirmed by talking to others present during it all. M had offered to stay at work a little later to let my bf leave early for an appt, and S said \u201cyou gotta take her out to dinner for that.\u201d My bf just awkwardly laughed and said he\u2019d pay her 20 bucks later. If S saw the both of them having a conversation, they\u2019d pass by going \u201cI see you two having fun\u201d, and make my bf just wrap up the convo as fast as he could in embarrassment. He\u2019s been avoiding M now as much as he could. When everyone heard about my bf\u2019s new Mustang, S told M in front of others \u201cI bet R would take you on a ride if you ask nicely.\u201d And gave little slaps on the shoulder to hype her up. Yes, my bf has asked S to stop with the comments about M since he barely knows her, and S would say it\u2019s just jokes before leaving abruptly.\n\nI had enough when S asked another work friend of mine what he thought M and my bf\u2019s kids would look like\u2026in response to my friend talking about his own kid. It took me everything I had to not cry right there. My bf was disgusted too, prob more than I was because he didn\u2019t eat that night. My boss is a really kind man, and he made time the next day to talk. We told him that this situation had been going on for a year, and that we didn\u2019t talk to him about it until now because we didn\u2019t know if we had enough to make a complaint. My bf told most of the story, since he was the one that was told all these things directly. The baby thing was explained last and my boss\u2019s face scrunched up a bit. He said he would have a discussion with S, and offered to mediate a conversation between the three of us so we can talk seriously. Me and my bf thanked him, and he said that he would let us know what happens when he can.\n\nHere\u2019s where I\u2019m getting heat for all of this. The next day after the talk we had with the boss, S did not show up for their shift. I got called in to the boss\u2019s office halfway through the day and saw my bf there as well. S had quit because the talk had escalated and they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement. He then told us that he permanently replaced S with someone else from another section that had supervisors to spare, and would be much stricter about the way things are done than S was. Word spread already, a coworker said that I needed to get over my insecurities because it cost us the best supervisor we had. My bf keeps telling me we did the right thing, but I\u2019m thinking maybe I blew things out of proportion and I should\u2019ve just had a stern talking to with S outside of work instead of going straight to the boss.

I once had my husband's best friend do this kind of stuff to me ALL THE TIME before we were married, even so far as bring another woman into the house. It tarnished their relationship, and if they hadn't worked together, he would have stopped being friends with him sooner, so I guess I'm trying to say I can empathize.", "NTA - supervisors who \"act as a friend\" and get most workers to say \"best supervisor we ever had\" often are manipulative and out only what they want.
