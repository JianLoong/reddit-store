Part of being a grown-up is to mange temporary or chronic conditions, even those that feel shameful, and not make it someone else's responsibility.\n\nIf he continues to refuse wearing diapers (or whatever they're called), you should definitely stop washing the sheets for him and maybe think about sleeping elsewhere so he can soak in his piss by himself (sorry for being rude, but from what you've written, I get the impression that he's just not good at taking responsibility.

He needs to continue to pursue medical treatment without needing you to arrange or prod him about it, clean up after himself, avoid drinking before sleep, and wear a diaper.

He isn\u2019t a child who isn\u2019t capable of doing this. He\u2019s an adult, and he can at the very least, put in as much effort as you in cleaning up the mess. \n\nI presume you have put a protective mattress cover on the mattress, because there is no good way of cleaning it up after numerous accidents.

A diaper isn't going to solve the problem.", "NTA. He should be washing the sheets!  He is the AH for even once expecting you to clean up after him.

I would break up with him. It's not just the incontinence, but my God, the inconsiderate nature of it all. He's not a cancer survivor/post surgical patient/child, he's not even your husband.

Take him to the store super early in the morning when there aren't a bunch of people in the store to judge, and I'm not suggesting you completely destroy the packaging, but tear a little hole in the corner to see if you can feel the material they're made of?  Then he can wait in the car while you purchase them, or have them shipped discreetly to your house.\n\nAlso, when we were in \"crazy new baby\" phase, they suggested we make a mattress lasagna to keep our sanity.

It helps eliminate some of the stress and worry and allows me at sleep through the night. As you can imagine, sleeping in wet sheets and clothes isn\u2019t comfortable.

I\u2019m sure when you\u2019re in the situation the stigma can be harder to brush aside, but the bottom line is he\u2019s causing you to suffer from his condition right alongside him, and that\u2019s simply not okay.

There's also companies that make absorbent towels/blankets with a waterproof material on one side and that can be washed daily instead of the sheets.
