Part of being a grown-up is to mange temporary or chronic conditions, even those that feel shameful, and not make it someone else's responsibility.\n\nIf he continues to refuse wearing diapers (or whatever they're called), you should definitely stop washing the sheets for him and maybe think about sleeping elsewhere so he can soak in his piss by himself (sorry for being rude, but from what you've written, I get the impression that he's just not good at taking responsibility.

He needs to continue to pursue medical treatment without needing you to arrange or prod him about it, clean up after himself, avoid drinking before sleep, and wear a diaper.

He isn\u2019t a child who isn\u2019t capable of doing this. He\u2019s an adult, and he can at the very least, put in as much effort as you in cleaning up the mess. \n\nI presume you have put a protective mattress cover on the mattress, because there is no good way of cleaning it up after numerous accidents.

I would break up with him. It's not just the incontinence, but my God, the inconsiderate nature of it all. He's not a cancer survivor/post surgical patient/child, he's not even your husband.

Take him to the store super early in the morning when there aren't a bunch of people in the store to judge, and I'm not suggesting you completely destroy the packaging, but tear a little hole in the corner to see if you can feel the material they're made of?  Then he can wait in the car while you purchase them, or have them shipped discreetly to your house.\n\nAlso, when we were in \"crazy new baby\" phase, they suggested we make a mattress lasagna to keep our sanity.

It helps eliminate some of the stress and worry and allows me at sleep through the night. As you can imagine, sleeping in wet sheets and clothes isn\u2019t comfortable.

I\u2019m sure when you\u2019re in the situation the stigma can be harder to brush aside, but the bottom line is he\u2019s causing you to suffer from his condition right alongside him, and that\u2019s simply not okay.

You absolutely don\u2019t deserve to keep waking up to pee on you but be gentle with him and give him some time to come around. He\u2019s probably in denial", "Get him to cut out caffeine and alcohol from his diet and also get him to drink a pint of water about half an hour before he goes to bed", "Also this has been MONTHS!\n\nOP- the fuck are you doing. Make him sleep on the couch with a plastic sheet protector if he doesn\u2019t want diapers. And make this adult man do his own laundry.", "He does wash them sometimes but usually in the end I end up helping him since we are both up at that point and he showers. I would also think he would rather wear a diaper but at the same time if it were be I\u2019d be in denial maybe for a while too", "This, and I want to add that laying a half or 3d of a sheet over the pad will hold it place, be less obvious about the pad and also be easy to wash if you have a washing machine to just toss it in.  Using the phrase \u2018disposable underwear\u2019 instead of \u2018diaper\u2019 is a psychological trick but it help minimize the individual\u2019s embarrassment. NTA.", "This.  NTA.", "That\u2019s what I was going to suggest. My husband ended up with diabetes while getting chemo. After chemo it went away. But last year all the sudden I noticed he was racing to pee all the time. Urgently and sometimes barely making it. I\u2019m like I think your blood sugar is spiking again. He\u2019s like I feel fine though (last time he was VERY tired also). He went and got checked. His blood glucose was 316 and his a1c was 11.? Yeah that took a bit to get it back down. He\u2019s on medication permanently now but luckily no insulin. \n\nNTA and OP tell him to man up and be respectful to you and wear the damn things.", "Any doctor that doesn't should lose their medical license. That was the first thing my doctor tested for after I wet the bed at 16 or 17.", "I would be hesitant to trust any Dr that completely ruled out a physical cause because most often those cases can eventually be diagnosed by a specialist. The challenge with diagnosing atypical incontinence is it can be many things. That said psychological causes should absolutely be explored especially if there are any prior traumas or current stressors.", "How cruel. There\u2019s a physical side and a psychological side to this kind of problem, especially for a man. Recommending that you dump a life partner for a medical condition? If she does this, he is so much better off without her in his life.", "It\u2019s happening to OP as well though. They\u2019re washing the sheets, they\u2019re getting peed on in bed. Pride and obstinacy are two different things.\n\nOP. NTA.", "Given he's also getting piss on her, this is affecting both of them. (Yes one more so than others, but ops feelings and boundaries should also be respected, and i think not wanting to be peed on is a very reasonable boundary)", "I saw someone somewhere here mention machine washable absorbant pads that he can sleep on. If those are a thing then look into getting some so he can just take it off the bed and put it in the wash after an accident. Plus there are other options like condom urinals, incontinence underwear etc. \n\nBed wetting as an adult is embarrassing and it's good he's seeking medical help, but in the meantime he needs to swallow his pride and help keep the messes to a minimum that's easier to clean up than expecting OP to change his soaking sheets every day. \n\nI also hope they're using a mattress protector as well otherwise that mattress is going to be ruined soon.", "Agreed. If it was me I\u2019d be embarrassed to do I really hate being that person. I have slept in another bed sometimes but alot of the time I end up sleeping with him. Which Is my fault honestly but either way I\u2019d be helping him clean", "I dont know is it more embarrassed to pee on your partner or to wear a diaper. I'd stop helping him clean at this point. Hes now making a decision to not prioritize how this affects you.", "I get where he\u2019s coming from but many, many women have incontinence after kids and as they age. Yes, his problem is different but it\u2019s still pee. Take him to the incontinence aisle at the store. There are tons of options all there out in the open. It\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about. Using some kind of barrier product will save time, money, and sleepless nights.", " I agree having to wash sheets everyday is annoying not to mention a waste when there's healthier solutions. Maybe ask him if there's a different option he'd rather use that would be more comfortable, like a sort of absorbent pad that will go under him to hold any mess akin to what medical staff use? There's also companies that make absorbent towels/blankets with a waterproof material on one side and that can be washed daily instead of the sheets. Wishing you both luck.", "You're enabling the pride by Washing the sheets for him. Stop doing it all together. Let him see how annoying it is to wash them everyday. Let him also pay for the water bill and take another one instead if yall were sharing it.\n\nThis needs to end now, where tf are we?? Kindergarden??", "Does he have a fetish for peeing on you or having you sleep in his pee?\nIt would not make it OK, it\u2019s just the only thing I can think of that your BF is choosing to piss on you. Which he is.  BY not sleeping elsewhere or wearing appropriate underwear.", "Are you sure this is not a fetish? \n\nNta but I find it odd he didn't  immediately  go to a doctor.  If Something  like this happened to me after the 2nd time I would make an appointment.", "It\u2019s not for the medical condition. It\u2019s for refusal to address the consequences of the medical condition. \n\nMedical condition means it\u2019s okay that he has incontinence issues not that he pees on bed and gf.", "Recommending that you dump someone who has 0 respect for you and takes 0 responsibility for thei condition is good advice.\n\nWetting the bed is not his fault. Not wearing appropriate underwear, cleaning the sheets after and actually managing his condition is 100% his fault. \nHe is her partner not her child.", "There are practical solutions so he will have to put his feelings aside and use the products available.", "Honestly, it\u2019s only been a few months and wearing a diaper for some can be a huge emotional step. I can understand putting down bed pads and the like in the meantime but for someone to have to wear them can be a very hard conclusion to accept. His mind has to accept some things too, and she needs to be patient. I deal with this on a daily basis in my home too, with two grown men I must care and clean up after in this capacity. It\u2019s not as easy for the person having to do it as it is to tell them that\u2019s what needs to happen. Just my opinion as someone who is in the same situation.", "u/Serdfghh is a comment-stealing bot. This comment was earlier posted [here](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k34cr/_/j5o6ixg/?context=1) by u/Sea_Supermarket_9728 .", "INFO: do you share a bed with the two men in question? If not, it\u2019s not the same thing. \n\nIt\u2019s a big emotional step to let someone wake you up nightly by urinating on you and OP might not be ready to take it.", "They stole a comment on anothe thread a second ago", "Yep, looks like most (all?) of their comments are stolen."]}
