Starting a few months ago he started wetting the bed which went from a one off haha funny  thing to now a reoccurring issue. (About 3-4 times a week) which as you could imagine is becoming more and more frustrating. To his credit he did go to the doctor about it eventually. However for what they tried so far nothing has seemed to really help him with his issue. \n\nWhen it does happen I usually clean the sheets or help him clean which was ok at first but now it happens so much it\u2019s becoming a huge hassle trying to keep cleaning the sheets almost every morning. \n\nThe only thing I can think of to fix this for now is he wears some kind of disposable product or diaper or something to not have to wash sheets every morning but when I brought it up to him he long story short said absolutely not. I tried to reassure him that it would just help everyone and it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about but i didn\u2019t get anywhere. I obviously understand why he\u2019s reluctant to do it. But I can\u2019t keep washing sheets and frankly wake up with his pee on me either \n\nSo AITA for trying to make him wear some kind of diaper to bed?\n\nEdit: wow thank you everyone I didn\u2019t expect so many responses so thank you. A few things I should have addressed in my original post and to answer a few common questions. \n\nI\u2019ll try to keep it short. \nHe does help clean the sheets when it happens. I do overall feel bad for him so most of the time I help. Either I take throw them in the wash and he puts them back on or the other way around. Sometimes I do both but maybe I will stop helping at all to try to get him to do something. But overall it is only about 15 minutes of actual work \n\nBut in short. He does help the majority of the time and if he doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s because I told him to which with what yous have said I\u2019ll stop doing \n\nHe doesn\u2019t have any drinking problems or anything like that either. In fact he really doesn\u2019t drink much at all in general. So not the cause \n\nHe did go to the doctor pretty early on so he was pointed to an urologist. I don\u2019t know I ton about what they told him. however I can say with confidence he absolutely did at least go and didn\u2019t lie about it.\n\nAlso best way I couple put it as someone who knows him and all but I highly highly doubt it\u2019s some kind of fetish.", "created_utc": 1674558805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10k34cr/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_that_wets_the_bed/", "score": 618, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I spray them with a stain and odour remover and just throw it in the wash. \n\nAlso, has he had any psychological changes recently?

He needs to continue to pursue medical treatment without needing you to arrange or prod him about it, clean up after himself, avoid drinking before sleep, and wear a diaper.

A diaper isn't going to solve the problem.", "NTA. He should be washing the sheets!  He is the AH for even once expecting you to clean up after him.

Take him to the store super early in the morning when there aren't a bunch of people in the store to judge, and I'm not suggesting you completely destroy the packaging, but tear a little hole in the corner to see if you can feel the material they're made of?

It helps eliminate some of the stress and worry and allows me at sleep through the night. As you can imagine, sleeping in wet sheets and clothes isn\u2019t comfortable.

I\u2019m sure when you\u2019re in the situation the stigma can be harder to brush aside, but the bottom line is he\u2019s causing you to suffer from his condition right alongside him, and that\u2019s simply not okay. If you live together full time, there is no excuse for him to continue doing this to you repeatedly, and it is on him to make a change.

He should absolutely be using protective underwear at night, but also, maybe set an alarm every couple of hours to use the restroom", "Put chux on the bed. Nursing homes and hospitals use it. Its fabric potty pads for adults. Change them instead of the sheets.", "NTA. But, have you looked into bed wetting pads? They lay out on the bed and absorb moisture so maybe that would be a good option so the sheets aren\u2019t washed as often and so he doesn\u2019t feel bad about needing to wear a diaper or something?", "NAH. He's sensitive about it but that doesn't mean it's not an issue for both of you.\n\n1) get a second and maybe a third set of sheets, and DEFINITELY a waterproof matress protector. that way you can change sheets faster and don't have to wait for the old clean ones every day, and you'll save your mattress (though i pray you've already got a protector)\n\n2) if doctors haven't found a cause (?) maybe bf needs to talk to a therapist. bed wetting can be a trauma thing, or a stress thing, but at the very least a therapist will help him talk through the actual accidents and get him to a point where he's more comfortable talking to you about it", "How old is he? There is another disorder called Diabetes Insipidus that is something entirely different than \u201cnormal\u201d diabetes. It\u2019s onset is teens or early 20s. It\u2019s supposed to be rare but I\u2019ve known a couple of people with it. To treat you take a pill called Desmopressin. Something to look into if all other diagnoses have failed.", "If he refuses to wear it,he needs to sleep on a rubber sheet in his own urine and change and wash his own sheets. He's peeing the bed at the end of the day and that's hideous to wake up to,let alone strip the bed etc etc. He needs to take responsibility for the unsavory effects of his incontinence on your life if he loves you. How would he feel if you had a period all over the sheets and wore no sanitary wear and woke up in your blood? He'd complain. It's a bodily fluid just the same and it isn't yours, it's his and it's occurring regularly!", "NTA.  \nI have a friend who was with someone who at the time took drugs (I was not told which sorts of drugs)   \n(years ago)   \nwho wet the bed frequently.   \nnot sure if because of the drugs.   \n\n\nbut is there anything big life wise happening at the moment?   \nhas your BF just moved in with you and could be adjusting to that?   \nany anxiety or daily struggles happening right now that could be a factor towards this?   \n\n\nand plus there are undersheets you can buy that are waterproof that will help towards making changing the bed easier if/when an accident happens. \"bed protectors\" etc....", "NTA. I will add that disposable underwear probably won\u2019t help much. Those are really only good for dribbles and OAB. A brief style product is your best bet if you want to cut down on laundry.", "Learned from potty training: puppy pads work in a pinch. NTA.", "It could be a TRAUMA RESPONSE. Did anything happen to him recently? Or childhood trauma that's only surfacing now? He's probably very  embarrassed about not having control, so it's normal to not want to wear those things. Maybe some reassurance, and approach the subject again gently. NAH.", "He rather pee everywhere than wear a diaper?\nWould he put a pad in his underwear? \n\nI hope yall have a plastic mattress cover. Cuz if not....I'm disturbed.\n\nHe needs to see another doctor. Or follow up with the last one. \n\nIf it's not pysical a psychologist. Does he have nightmares?", "NAH\n\nThe other advice holding true, mostly I\u2019d guess, I can\u2019t imagine what he\u2019s going through.", ">I hope you have a waterproof mattress cover or your mattress is fucked.\n\nThis is the first comment I saw that even mentioned the actual mattress. It must be nasty af by now without a waterproof cover. \n\nMy baby brother (as a toddler) used to climb in my bed in the middle of the night because he gets scared of the dark. And then he would proceed to pee. \ud83d\ude2c I used to run a floor washer over it but I eventually trashed it.", "Or ... It's a trauma response. It's very common to wet the bed after trauma, and not just children. Something could have happened to him recently that op doesn't know about. Or childhood trauma only now surfacing. Why is no one asking this?", "Right?  There's maybe 8 drugstores I could get too just off the highway on my way to/from work.  If I wanted I could probably cycle between them all so that there's no chance anyone even remembers me from looks lol", "You should NEVER wash them is the thing. That is his urine, his choice to urinate in the bed, and it is his job and his alone to clean up. It isn\u2019t that he is urinating at night, it\u2019s that he would literally rather inconvenience you, rather urinate ON you, than do something very simple to solve the problem. How can you be okay with someone who respects you so little? You are worth more than this.", "He showers while you clean up his pee (which also gets on you)? Dude\u2026", "Separate beds at this point. Two beds", "NTA. But you need a new mattress. Add plastic sheets and large pee pads to all go under the bedsheet.", "This is also barf survival 101. Life saver at 2am.", "My first thought was a fetish. I mean- most adults would be wanting to fix this issue *stat*. Especially due to the severity of it.  \n\nI have a feeling this is something sexual, but that's just a hunch of course lol", "There are also bed pads that are washable that work fine for medium flows.  You can get them at walmart, not expensive.  My mother was bed bound and they worked fine.  They are quilted and about 4 foot by 3 foot.", "Agree but the doctor may have already discussed those things but alcohol is one of those things that a doctor can\u2019t treat if it\u2019s undisclosed which is very common", "Or trauma response...", "I assume most caring partners would want to find some way to have their huge life change not soaking their partner most nights of the week. I\u2019d be more embarrassed that I was making my partner sleep in urine than finding some sort of pad or special underwear to deal with it. You\u2019re. Right that it\u2019s likely super stressful and embarrassing for him, but wouldn\u2019t that make it more likely to try to find solutions that protect you both until you find the root cause and can treat it? His refusal to do anything about it in the meantime is what\u2019s most weird.", "That's what I was about to ask. OP has he talked to a therapist?", "Mine asked if we could get them at Costco, to save $$. Never anything about my needing them. More medical tests are needed, I agree. OP, NTA, and I feel your frustration. Good luck.", "I figured. I wish you guys the best."]}
