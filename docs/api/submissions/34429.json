A 10 minute walk translates into a 2 minute drive.  This was selfish not business.", "YTA. It would be one thing if she was asking you to drive somewhere super far and was trying to scam you. However she clearly was having a rough day, which happens to everyone. However you leaving a young girl alone to walk in the middle of the night, in an area new to her, with a dead phone is ignorant and irresponsible at best are really vile at worst.

This has nothing to do with feminism and everything to do with being a decent human being.", "YTA. You left a young person alone and lost at 1 am, when you could have delivered her safely to her destination within minutes. I hope someone never treats your family member this way. A little decency would\u2019ve gone a long way. \n\nFrom a business perspective, it\u2019s likely this young lady would\u2019ve used your services going forward and recommended you to friends and family.", "I'm gonna say YTA just because I can't fathom sending a percievable teenager crying into the dark past midnight into an area she barely knows.\n\nLike... that sounds like a recipe for disaster and you'll never know of anything happened, but if it did... \n\nSo because I would literally never - YTA.\n\nAlso it would be discounted technically not free.", "YTA.  WTF is wrong with you?  Seriously.  This is messed up.  A young crying person who doesn't know their way is a prime target for anyone with bad intentions.  Take her the rest of the way home.

I get trying to maximize business, and that morality can often lead to not making decisions that are 100% best for the business, but that is that. Doing what is best for business rather than doing is morally right is morally wrong.

It used to be hyperbolic to say that she could have been raped or killed, but that shit is happening more than it should.", "YTA.

I personally don't relate with that fear, but I understand to an extent. That is HORRIFYING, the fear driven into you, possible SA, abduction, over all terrible things, and the unfortunate reality is that that's something young women and women in general have to worry about.

Small kindnesses go a long way. It was a possibly dangerous 10 minute walk for her, but a safe 2 minute drive for you. \n\nOnce me and my boyfriend at the time were supposed to sleep at a friends house for a party. After we hade been there a while drinking, she was like oh alot of people have asked to stay so you both are sleeping in bed with me. It made me feel weird so we decided to get a taxi home. We were talking about it in the taxi. I realised I only had like $10 so we told the dude to just drop us off when we reached our limit. He just turned the meter off and drove us the whole way home for free. That was a big deal for me. It reminded me the world is a good place.", "YTA, and nothing to do with feminism. Yes, something bad is more likely to happen to a teenage girl than an adult man but you'd be a bit shitty in that situation too.\n\nA 10 minute walk would have taken you absolutely no time to drive her.", "YTA - you left a young girl who was lost and clearly upset & scared alone in the middle of the night with no phone to be able to get help. All for the sake of a couple minutes further driving which is worth what? A few quid? \n\nI get that its a job but try to be less of an awful person in future, this is truly a horrible way to act.

I hope you never have a daughter who goes through this.", "Yes YTA no question about it. Like wtf is that mindset, business is business? She needed your help and you left her on the streets at 1am for a 10min walk. Her safety is not worth it? It\u2019s a short drive for crying out loud. Use better judgement.", "I think you know the answer. A 10 minute walk is 1/2 mile. You traded her emotional well being and possibly safety for 1/2 mile.", "What did you do after you dropped her off? Did you immediately have another passenger you needed to pick up? If not, you were probably just driving around for 10 minutes in which case you could have easily took her home.", "Yta", "YTA and a huge one. And this has nothing to do with feminism. If you understood business, you would have taken her home and she would have told lots of people about your generosity and what a nice guy you are. If or when you have a daughter, at least you\u2019ll understand then, I think.", "YTA. Do you know where she works? Consider leaving a card at her work with an apology, a note that your partner said you should have done the right thing and you didn\u2019t consider the impact on a vulnerable person, and put in a taxi voucher for $20 to make up for it.", "YTA dude. Jesus. I hate people that are rigid and by the book. She could have been hurt because you wanted to follow the rules. There\u2019s a grey area man.

You put money before someone's safety and that makes you an arsehole in my opinion.\n\nHave you ever stopped to check if someone needs help when broken down on the side of the road?", "A 10 minute walk would have been like a 4 minute cab ride... Just take her home. YTA.", "A ten minute walk is like a 2 minute drive... would it really have killed you? Reminds me of the taxi driver who refused to take me as a paying customer after I sprained my ankle because it was only a ten minute drive and he wanted a bigger fare.

Unfortunate things happen every day but they would all be way worse if we didn't have people out there that showed us empathy and understanding. You did not do this . Your gf is golden!", "YTA! Where is your humanity? Bad things happen ALL THE TIME! If something had happened to her it would have been partially on you.

Shame on you, OP.", "I had a cabby friend before, when I was going to bars. I called or texted him personally for a ride all the time. Paid and tipped well. And when something bad happened and I didn't know where I was, at like 5am on a Sunday, he was there to take me home and didn't charge me. I was really grateful.\n\nI don't think you thought much about it and I get that you can't give free or reduced rides to everyone -- cabbies have to pay it upwards too. I understand not wanting to make a habit of charity in your job. But... you didn't offer, and yeah she's not entitled to help, and yeah she got herself into a bad sitch and that's not your fault. But didn't you feel anything when a crying, lost young person walked away from you in the night when you could have helped? You didn't even think about her?\n\nNTA for not giving free rides, but you might be an asshole in general. Like a bad person, I mean. Your gf is right to mistrust you because you don't look out for those around you. You don't think ahead or give to others even when it would cost you so relatively little.", "YTA but I think you know that and will do better next time. If it was a reoccurring thing from her that would be one thing, but this clearly isn't the case here.", "YTA. I understand having a business and wanting to earn money. But you weren't driving her home for free, she was giving you all the tips she had to pay and yeah driving the extra few minutes would have put you out money but its only a couple minutes. Imagine being in her shoes, youre a lone teenage girl in the city at nighttime and you oaid all you could for a taxi but you still have to walk 10 minutes home in the dark. She didnt even have her phone flashlight or a way to call someone if something went wrong, she didnt even have money cause she gave it all to you. She was stranded in a place she didnt know well, so of course she was crying. She's scared and she has every right to be. Your girlfriend's right, if something happened to that girl itd be your fault. Imagine if that girl had been your sister or a daughter or a niece or even your girlfriend. Would you not be angry if some taxi driver left them stranded when it only would've taken a couple extra minutes to help? It's not even about rught or wrong because in your jobs terms you were in the right but in every other sense you are a colossal asshole.", "YTA\nIt would\u2019ve taken you a few mins to help her get home safe.

You left a young woman alone in an area she doesn't know at 1am as opposed to recognising how vulnerable women are by themselves at night! Your girlfriend's right. If something has happened to her, your first thought would have been why didn't I just take her all the way. Safety should always be more important than money", "When you're old and thinking back on your life, it's very possible you will regret the times you weren't a decent human being.\n\nIf that happens, you'll remember this. You'll remember that it would have cost you, what? An extra 2 minutes to get that girl home safely?\n\nMost of us think we're decent people. But most of us rarely get tested.

I get you would have been giving her a discount (not for free) but a bit of kindness and compassion goes a long way. You had to give her directions so knew she was new to the area, so maybe she didn't actually know how much it would cost to get her to her destination. Yet you couldn't bring yourself to spend an extra couple of minutes getting her safely there. That's pretty heartless and cynical, and is a poor reflection on you.", "This reminded me of something similar that happened here in my country a few months ago, and it ended badly for the girl. \n\nIt would absolutely not kill you to drive a few more km and drop her off at home.\n\nYTA.", "Yta 100%.

Instead, you left a girl in a bad situation when she was visibly upset and vulnerable for the sake of saving a few minutes or making a couple bucks.", "NTA and here\u2019s why. All those saying it\u2019s a minor have no clue. Here in the states anyone still in high school is not allowed to work after 10 pm on a week day which means she\u2019s over 18. If she\u2019s leaving work after 1am then she\u2019s more than likely working at a bar as most restaurants close after 10 which means she\u2019s more than likely over 21. She knows how much it\u2019ll take to get a cab ride home as most cabs and uber-like businesses use apps that have pick up and drop off and everything is paid before you the car gets there so I call scam. I\u2019m all for helping people but scams are scams. Even my old phone that doesn\u2019t hold a charge anymore still lasts me a day as long as I\u2019m not playing games on it and I always have a charging cable with me if I\u2019m going out all day so I can do a quick charge if needed", "YTA 100%. a 10 minute walk is like 30 more seconds of driving.

NTA\n\nIt\u2019s also reasonable to ask for the fare before the trip starts at 1am on a party night. It\u2019s the norm where I live (too many dashers). If she hasn\u2019t got the fare she should resolve that - if she\u2019s working in a bar until 1am she\u2019s an adult/over 18.
