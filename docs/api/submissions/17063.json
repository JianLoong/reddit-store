I\u2019m sure it all didn\u2019t just turn to dust", "Giving a modeler's perspective:\n\nOP is at least asshole-ish.\n\nOP's family is obviously awful for allowing all this to happen, enabling the kid, for minimizing OP's hobbies/loss, etc.\n\nI have one of these kits though. They're big and relatively sturdy. I can imagine how certain parts on it would break. But here's the thing about model kits:\n\nIn the modeling community, we have a saying that goes kinda like, \"there's no such thing as a mistake.\" And the idea behind that is how you could bust a kit clean in half, but there are tons of ways you could go about rectifying that.\n\nBreak a piece in half? There's stuff called \"plastic glue\" that will let you slightly chemically melt the plastic and reattach it. Some critical piece is broken that bears weight? You can drill a hole to shove a thin metal rod in between the parts to help make them sturdy again. Lose a piece? You can make a replacement - either by hand with modeling board, or with a 3D printer. Paint-job gets all messed up? You can dissolve the paint off and paint it again. Accidentally cut a gouge in a piece? You can fill in the cut with plaster, sand off the surface so it's smooth, and paint over it. TBF not everyone can or wants to do these things, but OP discusses \"kitbashing\" which implies he already does many of these things already. And that aside, the modeling community that I've experienced is very helpful and welcoming, and would provide a lot of free guidance to get started.\n\nUnless the kid proceeded to just jump up and down on this model kit afterwards until it shattered into a billion pieces, I find it hard to believe it dropping on the floor - or even being thrown on the floor - from a child's height would cause irreparable damage/a total loss. I've dropped kits from the same manufacturer all of the time, and barely had much if any damage, nevermind totaled.\n\nThe whole series of events sucks, but I don't see why OP would need $900 to replace it/fix it. What OP could have done, is write up a list of modeling supplies - like paint, sandpaper, masking tape, etc - and itemize how much that would cost. Which I guarantee that unless OP was buying a brand new airbush, it would cost significantly less and be a much easier pill for his family to swallow. OP would also get to salvage this original model kit of his and have fun fixing it in the process (since this kind of activity is inherently fun for most modelers to begin with).\n\nThe fact OP is asking for $900 so they can kitbash the thing all over again with brand new kits just seems ridiculous to me unless OP's nephew also took a hammer to it or if someone threw everything away immediately before OP could rescue the pieces. So OP is either putting their petty vendettas first, or trying to get his family to subsidize his hobby so he can build something brand new instead of fixing an old kit.", "You tried a reasonable option, and she said no.

I dont have a 3d printer myself, but i did ask a local place that makes the parts. They gave me 250 USD price just for a static frame, no movement or joints. Im not even adding the cost of paint, decals, markers or anything i used when making it. It was not an expensive kit when i got it in 2010, but since it is not made anymore it is very rare and very expensive, and the USD to TL exchange rate isnt helping at all. I know how to fix kits Tamiya cement and glue, i did it to a few of the parts to repair them but the frame and the chest is unfixable.\n\nYes fixing the kits are really fun, but for fixing them there needs to be something left to fix.", "Don't feel guilty she needs to learn and to teach her kid that no means no. Whatever it costs now will be less than the cost of them never learning. I don't think I need to explain what boys who don't understand no growup to be", "Damn, talk about a shame. Mind if i ask what else you had in your gunpla lineup? Got me curious tbh.", "Gundam models are plastic.  Plastic doesn\u2019t vaporize - I assume you mean some parts broke, and some parts bent.  \n\nAs a hobbyist I would find it hard to believe you couldn\u2019t save at least 70% of it with some plastic glue, and some hot water to rebend some of the pieces.  \n\nYou should ask for damages, but you are much better off asking for a smaller amount than asking for the moon - no court is going to award a mortgage payment over some Gundam figures.", "That's all fair. Sorry this happened to ya btw. It might be a bit of a wait, but they do reprint MGs like The O every once in a while which'll make it a lot cheaper. I bought a reprint a few years ago.", "Right, like why should OP go through leaps and bounds to fix something they didn't break.", "Yeah. And i dont get it at all, my family taught me i wasnt supposed to touch someone elses stuff unless they literally handed it to me, how hard can it be to teach your kid to not touch others stuff especially if they say no?", "Well, i had a RG Zeta, RG ZZ, a full custom MG Barbatos Lupus Rex( i saved the inner frame so if i can get or make new armor panels for it so it can be fixed.) A HG Nu, a HG H-Nu, a Gundam Heavyarms Custom with IGEL Pack (i saved the IGEL pack and the weapons and im gonna try fixing the frame too as soon as i can replace my small drill bits and Tamiya cement and stuff), an HG Epiyon, and a custom HG Gusion Rebake Full City. \n\nAs for what i had on that The O, i had a High Mega launcher with a RX-78 napalm launcher underbarrel, Kshatriya wings (i couldnt find the full kit but gotten the wings from a seller) and a handmade enlarged Red Rider Shield/Sword.", "Ok, but you got it for $25, and it\u2019s only so expensive because it\u2019s OOP.  I collect rare stuff too so I get it, but kitbashing does not mean just adding up the parts from other kits you used - those parts are worth a tiny fraction of the kit, and kitbashed models are often (unfortunately) worth less than a i kitbashed kit.\n\nI don\u2019t know how you could really win this in a court case unless a judge really understands the hobby.  Otherwise they would just ask to see your proof of payment and ask her to pay you the $25 you originally paid.\n\nA compromise might be to ask for $200 to settle the issue, and I think there is very little chance you will get $900 just because that\u2019s the going eBay price for a bunch of kits (of which only a portion goes into this model). \n\nI would say both are assholes - her for not controlling her kid, but you for taking this as an opportunity to basically \u201csell\u201d your model for far more than it\u2019s worth.", "I am asking for the smaller amount. Like i had Kshatriya wings i had gotten from internet and im just putting what the wings go for instead of the whole kit. And im not even putting the handmade stuff i made into the price like the custom stand, the extra joints for the addons, the enlarged Red Rider Shield/Sword combo thing i made myself. If i had asked for the kits instead of just what the parts go for, it would most likely cost at least double or triple of it with taxes.", "No problem. And yeah, i do hope to get reprints of some old kits but i didnt ever see a The O reprint. I dont think they will make it since from what i remember it didnt sell very well back then. Aslo its not Unicorn or RX-78 so it wont get its 11th modernisation anytime soon.", "Thats an awesome collection I must say I'm a bit envious. I'd love to expand mine but Ive fallen off them sadly.", "Jeebus! No wonder the price for the parts would climb from 300 for the plain, unbuilt kit, to nearly 900!\n\nAt least you've got footage that proves that the child did, indeed, damage your kit intentionally and not because you left it unattended in a precarious spot.\n\nI hope things work out for you, OP, even if it takes a while to settle, and you get a little less than you deserve (which can be a possibility, unfortunately).\n\nNTA. And good luck!", "It depends. If its just a snap build (no paint, no decal, no panel marking just cutting it from the runners and building) it goes around the same. But if its worked on like the one i had made the price soars. Even just panel lining can cause a 50 dollars of a difference.", "I dont know the whole legal jargon, but that lawyer friend of my family told me is there is something called replacement value. From what he told me, it is the price of replacing the material parts (the kits used but not the paint or the airbrush in this example) from a checked seller. Like lets say you have a car you bought for 1k USD 50 years ago but now it is worth 80k, and you had put new brakes and stuff to make it better. If someone completely destroys it to unrepairable levels they are made to pay for the replacement of materials, ie the car, brakes and other things but not the manpower or time you used.", "So you be cool with these people being homeless so OP can replace a model immediately? That's pretty fucked up.", "I was really lucky in that. My uncle is a businessman, and he goes to Japan every year at least once for job reasons. Eachtime he goes he gets me new kits and since he buys them directl there they were much cheaper. He hasnt been there ever since Covid started, but i found about Hobbylink Japan and they deliver without a lot of fees so i did get back recently with Aerial and Pharact.", "I'm not fully familiar with the hobby, I'm just wondering if there is a cheaper way to end up with the same end product", "Insurance might may replacement value, if you pay a high enough premium, but insurance companies have big pockets.\n\nIn a civil suit, against a mom with a child, a judge is unlikely to award you replacement value for a toy that could cost the other family their living standards.  \n\nPlus, even your calculations don\u2019t make sense, because you are using the full value of kitbashed kits, when in reality it\u2019s just some leftover parts.  It\u2019s like if you swapped the engine and mirrors between 3 luxury cars each worth $100,000, and now you ask for $300,000 from car insurance when it crashes.  No insurance company would pay that.", "Not really. Its always cheaper getting it unopeened, since they are put inside the box right out of inhection molds so it takes a decent but of work just to put it together in the most basic way. There are some knockoff kits that are cheaper, but they are so low quality they are not used as normal builds but as destroyed suits in panoramas.", "900 is that lower price. If i want replacement for the whole kits (i only had wings from a Kshatriya so im just putting the price of what the wing parts goes on the internet instead of the whole kit) it would cost triple of that. Also im not even putting the handmade parts into price since i dont know if they woudl count or not.", "That is entirely dishonesy. No one buys a bunch of kits to use a few pieces from them. You kitbash from the spare pieces you have lying around. Also, while the robot fell apart, i'd bet most of the actual pieces are still fine. \n\nOP is totally trying to scam a lady who lost her house in an earthquake.", "Doesn't matter whether it's a toy or an antique vase.  What matters is that she failed to control her child, who damaged your property, incurring an expensive loss.   If she won't make it right, that's what the courts are for.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - you break it, you pay for it. She could work out a payment schedule with you, but she doesn't want to do that, so you are within your rights to take her to court.", "NTA \n\nYou asked her to remove her kid from your model. \n\nShe fought for her kid to play with the model. \n\nShe now owes for the model", "NTA.\n\nBuuuuuuut I urge you to seriously consider how badly this is going to screw over their family, especially since there are kids involved. Both because the idea of a child being homeless over a collectible is horrifying, and also because if you do this, you may rapidly find yourself with very little family left that will talk to you. Is it worth it to you to get another one, if it means you lose family? Just some stuff to consider!", "From OP's comments, when asked about accepting a payment plan.\n\n>*I tried but she refused it all. I even asked that lawyer family friend to tell her in the legal manner but she flatout refuses it all.*\n\nOP would settle at the moment for a payment plan where the aunt would recognize the debt.\n\nBut the aunt refuses to do so, meaning she has no interest of compensating OP for the damage her bratty, entitled child did.\n\nETA OP's quote.", "What album it is? Check my profile", "It CAN be difficult with small children but she felt entitled to your model so her kid could be entertained for a minute or two. Which he undoubtedly was. \n\nA parent who tried to be a good parent would have told the kid no, calmly asked for the model back, and been inconsolable when it was destroyed. The kid would have had age-appropriate consequences.", "Aunt is not homeless. She rents a house, and the landlord is eager to have her remain there for the same rent.\n\nAlso, OP would settle for now for a payment plan that the aunt could settle in an acceptable timeframe. But the aunt refuses to sign, even after talking to a lawyer that is a family friend.\n\nShe simply does not want to compensate OP for the damage her child did.", "OP lives in Turkey. The available legal routes may not be the same as in the US.", "You're certainly pressing to make OP the bad guy in this. \n\nThe aunt did not lose the house, unlike thousands of their neighbors. She rents an apartment, and the landlord is eager to have her there bc at least that means some steady income.\n\nShe has the money to pay OP, but she had set it aside to make a downpayment towards a house. And she refuses to sign an I.O.U. or similar, which, if OP does not pursue this legally, will mean that the entitled mother and child will walk away without any sort of compensation for the damage the child did.", "i think she should reimburse him a reasonable amount for his toy. But not for $900 which is OP wet dream about what his magical toy is worth. Not its real legal worth.", "OP says he would settle for a payment plan at the moment, but the aunt flatout refuses.\n\nShe simply does not want to compensate OP for the damage her bratty kid did.", "NTA. This was not a toy, it was a valuable collector's item. It was not broken by accident, she deliberately and maliciously destroyed it because her child did not get to play with it. She should absolutely be held accountable.", "NTA. People need to keep an eye on their curious kiddos, especially when over at other people's houses.", "YTA house > gundam", "The relative surely didn't consider the consequences before letting their kid play with someone else's expensive item. If the only people lost are the ones who think it's ok to break and feel entitled to your stuff I doubt it'll be a huge loss.", "Ooh that kind of rhymed I like that!", "HLJ is such a great source! They have a lot of kits that are hard to purchase elsewhere. I use gundamstoreusa as well because theyre in country (of course) so it doesnt take as long to get.", "Given that's something you do because you love it but also put it time and money into it, you have every right to be mad. You said 'no', she should've respected that especially if she knew her kid was going to damage it in some way. She basically dug this hole herself, not you.\n\nNTA", "NTA this doesn\u2019t sound like an accident to me. It sounds like the kid did it on purpose. She needs to replace what he broke.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA for the circumstances but as it could potentially negatively affect both your familiar relationship and her financial life, perhaps some kind of repayment plan would be easier for her to swallow and for you to recoup your lost items.", "Oh no! I'm so sorry this happened to you and your family! But on to your question. NTA! Builds are time consuming and they can get expensive, especially if you have to (or decide to) kitbash. Hunting down and finding specific pieces can take hours to months. I know how much pride goes into each build, no matter how big or small it is. Your mother's cousin is responsible for her kids behavior. An 8 yr old is old enough to know that they shouldn't touch things that are not theirs. And they had to climb on a chair to reach it, it's not like it was just sitting there on the floor. I'm sorry your build was smashed, I'm sorry you lost the rest of your collection. I hope this gets resolved quickly. These builds are not toys, they are personal works of love, time, creativity and they are art pieces.", "NTA but I've built gunpla, dropped gunpla, reassembled gunpla no way the model is completely wrecked and you can't salvage most parts. Get her to pay for a new o kit, but the rest is iffy imho.\n\nI'm not even sure a judge would side with you completely.", "NTA. You offered her to pay it later. She refused, because she will never pay you. You have no other choice if she doesn't want to take the consequences of her brats behavior.", "I would agree except for that part about the exchange rate making the amount the equivalent of a down payment on a house.
