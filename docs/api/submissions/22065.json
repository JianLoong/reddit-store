I told her that she could identify as non-binary or bi-gender or pretty much anything except Two-spirit, and she refused and said \u201cjust leave me alone and don\u2019t invalidate me.\u201d this made me really upset so I said \u201cI didn\u2019t spend time teaching you about my culture just idiots like you could steal it.\u201d which made her block me.

This is a prime example of cultural appropriation and you are under no obligation to tolerate it or let it go.", "NTA. Non-Natives have to realize how shitty it is to just appropriate Native cultures. Native people have had to struggle to retain their cultures. They had to survive boarding schools where they would be tortured for speaking their languages, praying in the ways of their people, or having anything at all to do with their cultures. They had to face prison time for practicing their cultures (until the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act).\n\nSo, yeah, it's shitty for these people to come along and say \"this is mine now\" and start using things their people not only tried to suppress and eradicate but also didn't even have to struggle for. Cultural practices become a novelty item to them. They lack meaning to them because they don't have the cultural background to even be able to understand them.

I have no reason not to believe that people with exactly the same experience of gender exist everywhere - not just in Native American tribes.\n\nBut I also think that there's a deep element of appropriating \"cool bits\" from native American cultures here.

I think you're right.\n\n(I think there are ways for a non-Native American to say that a two-spirit understanding is a good match for the way they experience themselves, without saying \"I am two-spirit\", and I think some of those would be OK and not appropriation. )", "No, absolutely NTA, that is super gross, egregious behavior.

That said, she also needs to respect the culture it's coming from. As a white person, we love ideas that other cultures have and in white America we have this thing where we see Native American culture as spiritual in a hippy sort of way. It's not cool but it's a thing. It doesn't give us an excuse to just use something ceremonial or important to a culture if we relate to it. This isn't like incorporating some ideas, like simple clothing, patterns, or games. It's taking something that is regarded as important and using it to their own wants and needs.
