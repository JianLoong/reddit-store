I am of Ojibwe and Lencan descent so I taught her all I could. I have no problem sharing my culture as long as people are respectful of it. Eventually I explained what Two-spirit was. For those who are unaware Two-spirit is a term that describes a concept used by some Native American tribes which is the idea that there is a third-gender who encompasses the male and female spirit. Two-spirit people play an important role in traditional ceremonies and are regarded as very important. A few days pass and I see that Kai added \u201cTwo-spirit\u201d to her Instagram bio. I politely message her and explain that only Native American people be Two-spirit and she tells me to \u201clet it go\u201d I explain to her that it\u2019s quite hurtful to see that in her bio, especially knowing that Two-spirit people had to hide who they were for centuries due to colonization. I told her that she could identify as non-binary or bi-gender or pretty much anything except Two-spirit, and she refused and said \u201cjust leave me alone and don\u2019t invalidate me.\u201d this made me really upset so I said \u201cI didn\u2019t spend time teaching you about my culture just idiots like you could steal it.\u201d which made her block me. I hear nothing for a few days until our other friends begin messaging me and saying \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to hurt her like that\u201d and \u201cyou should just let her be herself\u201d so now I kinda feel bad for her.

Your \u201cfriend\u201d is being disgusting. So are those criticizing you for asking them not to do that anymore. This is a prime example of cultural appropriation and you are under no obligation to tolerate it or let it go.", "NTA. Non-Natives have to realize how shitty it is to just appropriate Native cultures. Native people have had to struggle to retain their cultures. They had to survive boarding schools where they would be tortured for speaking their languages, praying in the ways of their people, or having anything at all to do with their cultures. They had to face prison time for practicing their cultures (until the 1978 American Indian Religious Freedom Act).\n\nSo, yeah, it's shitty for these people to come along and say \"this is mine now\" and start using things their people not only tried to suppress and eradicate but also didn't even have to struggle for. Cultural practices become a novelty item to them. They lack meaning to them because they don't have the cultural background to even be able to understand them. Everything becomes reduced to a fad.", "NTA, but your friends sure are. \n\nBottom line: if they don\u2019t respect you\u2019re culture, then they don\u2019t respect *you.*", "So two-spirit is a way that Native Americans have traditionally had of describing/understanding certain kinds of people. I have no reason not to believe that people with exactly the same experience of gender exist everywhere - not just in Native American tribes.\n\nBut I also think that there's a deep element of appropriating \"cool bits\" from native American cultures here. This has overtones of the white woman who claims to have a deep understanding of Native American spirituality based on the fact that she owns a pair of moccasins that she bought at a Native American craft fair.\n\nOr the idiot people that have Chinese, or Japanese, or Latin, or some other language they don't speak tattooed on them because they think you get bonus mysticism points that way.\n\nSo NTA. I think you're right.\n\n(I think there are ways for a non-Native American to say that a two-spirit understanding is a good match for the way they experience themselves, without saying \"I am two-spirit\", and I think some of those would be OK and not appropriation. )", "No, absolutely NTA, that is super gross, egregious behavior. Shame on her.", "NTA - I get that she relates to the concept. It's still cringy af to do that when it's not your culture. Like anime fans calling people senpai, it's cringy. That said, she also needs to respect the culture it's coming from. As a white person, we love ideas that other cultures have and in white America we have this thing where we see Native American culture as spiritual in a hippy sort of way. It's not cool but it's a thing. It doesn't give us an excuse to just use something ceremonial or important to a culture if we relate to it. This isn't like incorporating some ideas, like simple clothing, patterns, or games. It's taking something that is regarded as important and using it to their own wants and needs. Your friend could just use the term Non-Binary or Bi-Gender but wants to be that spiritual hippy type thing that we white people tend to like.", "NTA your friend sucks tbh", "NTA YT people have a multitude of terms they (?) could choose from. Using that one is appropriation and a jerk move", "NTA- it\u2019s one thing to ask about someone else\u2019s culture, it\u2019s a completely different thing to respect and appreciate that culture. \n\nThe teachings are sacred. To have people not part of the culture saying, \u201cjust let me be me,\u201d and coining aspects of our culture is very rude and not appropriate at all. \n\nIm sorry those type of people were supposed to be your friends but aren\u2019t acting like so.", "NTA. She has no right to steal. She didn\u2019t really listen to the things you shared. Is she maybe a spirit-empty person? \n\nStart posting on Instagram about people who have lost their high status jobs because of appropriating Native culture and lying about their heritage.", "NTA. Your friend is entitled and ignorant.", "NTA that sucks. Try and have a calm conversation with her if you can about it later if possible. Try and turn it into a teachable moment for them but of course you did nothing wrong", "NTA\n\nI have very, very little Apache in me (don't get too excited, I'm as blue-eyed European as they come), but I don't go around calling myself Two-Spirit. I know it's important and it would be disrespectful to my friends and colleagues who grew up on native land. Not to mention I can't help but think of my ancestors who would surely be wondering why I, having no real history or knowledge of my ancestors thanks to erasure, am calling myself Two-Spirit. Saying I'm gender fluid/bi-gender is better for me.\n\nYour friends who are getting upset with what you said are being extremely ignorant and arrogant about your culture. She can be herself all she wants, but she can't disrespect you and expect to be respected.", "Info:  how do you know that two spirit didn\u2019t fit exactly with who she is.  Like she has been lost not fitting with herself and the two spirit concept far better explains her than non-binary or other western term on the gender spectrum.\n\nObviously I can\u2019t tell and it\u2019s possible you can\u2019t either if she is appropriating culture or if the term accurately defines her identity.\n\nSo I don\u2019t think we have enough info to make a judgement here as it really depends on if this is who she is.  If it is then it would be cruel to take away the identify she is.", "INFO: Are you sure she got two-spirit from the information you shared about your culture?
