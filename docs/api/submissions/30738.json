{"id": 30738, "submission_id": "17sg91q", "title": "AITA for asking my husband to financially support me?!", "selftext": "Throwaway account.\nI (30F) moved overseas for my husband's (M31) job. I left my career behind where I was earning decent money (\u00a345k). However, when I was back in the UK, I was financially carrying the household, the bills, rent, childcare, food etc with almost zero help from my now husband. He was living away from us (overseas posting) at the time but his outgoing were maximum 500 a month on a 50k job. Outgoings for me were around 2.5k a month and I managed to put a little bit away in to savings. \n\nI was bringing up his daughter in the UK by myself (emotionally, mentally, physically and financially) and didn't ask for anything apart from the odd bail out for additional food/petrol etc. I let him build his savings. Nothing much at all... After all, we were a \"team\". I didn't fully resent it at the time. I just thought to myself \"he can help me out in the future\". He said HE WOULD. Now it's a different story. \n\nSo, I'm now in a new country. And I'm studying again. I can't work over here because of the language barrier in the local area and I can't go further afield as he has the car and there's no after school clubs, so childcare constraints. I'm absolutely ok with that, and I'm paying for my degree by myself from my savings (I can't get student finance). \n\nSo, I asked my husband tonight BECAUSE HE GETS EXTRA MONEY FOR ME BEING OUT HERE (like, it's about 1k extra, not pennies), \"Can I get some of that money so I can buy myself some things and also put some money aside?\" (Essentially, I will smash through every penny of my savings with this degree and some... And I will go in to debt if I don't get help). \n\nHis response, \"no\". Apparently \"no-one\" he works with gives their spouse any financial help. I called bullshit and refused to talk to him this evening. \n\nI'm RAGING. I paid for ALL his daughters childcare and food, housing etc. All the bills. I barely asked for anything from him. But, now I need help?! Nothing. Nada. ZERO. He has THOUSANDS in savings. I am just trying to not have a break down over my finances.\n\nI'm thinking about going home to be honest. He'd lose me and his precious \"extra money\".\n\nAm I taking it too far? AITA?\n\n\nTo answer some common Q's... \n\nI'm not sure why I kept writing \"his\" child. She's our daughter- I'm the biological mother (sperm donor) and he's the adoptive father. \n\nWe had a financial plan before moving out where, because he'd earn more with us being out here, the extra cash would  pay for me to study. I hadn't wanted to sit around and do nothing, so I thought I'd use this time to create options to better my career when we eventually move back. But, as of yet, I've covered those fees from my savings. \n\n\n", "created_utc": 1699656908, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17sg91q/aita_for_asking_my_husband_to_financially_support/", "score": 24, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
