Who\u2019s really the baby here?\n\nI\u2019d recommend taking him to those places where they have machines that can make men feel the cramping. It should be fun.", "Reading just the title of the post I was ready to say y t a obvs because nobody wants to hear about that ... but after reading the entire post, I have to say NTA because he deserved that. It's still true that nobody wants to hear about that, but in this case he invited it on himself.\n\nYou just taught him a lesson he should have already learned: Don't ask questions if you don't want to hear the answers.", "NTA. Sexism rears its ugly head again.", "When men on various talk shows wore a menstrual cramp simulator on their bellies and it was turned up to 10, they were either impressed that women endured that every month or they were babies.", "Why are you friends with that guy", "NTA - I think that guy got some schooling that he did not receive from an actual school. I'm glad the girls backed you up, and some of the other guys. Good on you for trying to make the most of a bad day, period cramps are the worst, and it's normal (although ones that painful might need to be discussed with a doctor!)", "NTA. He opened up for you telling how bad it can be by saying \u201chow bad can it be\u201d. Unfortunately he didn\u2019t listen.", "YTA", "NTA. He didn't know what the hell he was talking about, so you schooled him. Good for you! You can sit wherever you want, and *he* can change *his* seat.", "Did you tell him about feeling the tearing when blood clots come loose? We can be AHs together", "Note two males sided with him. We really need to better educate boys and men about periods. The fact he was disgusted shows how uneducateed he is. There was an experiment where men were put on tens machines which simulated periods. Trust me, they were educated pretty fast! NTA", "Not to be a dick, but please go back and spellcheck/edit your post. This was hard to read.", "NTA, he deserved that. I wouldn't even want to be anywhere near someone like that.", "NTA. Dude was dismissive and rude, good education to learn it's much more than \"a little blood\"", "NTA.\n\nIf he didn't want to know what a woman's period might entail, he should have kept his mouth shut. I also have painful periods and I wouldn't take shit from anyone who ridiculed that pain. I think you should reconsider your friendship with that guy and the two who sided with him.", "NTA. Tell him to stop acting like a baby over a little information.", "NTA. Your male friend is an asshole. Personally, I don't blame him for being a little grossed out at the graphic details, but he definitely had those graphic details coming. Men should know that they have no idea about how bad periods can get, and believe women when they say they're going through it.", "NTA! And it was good for a guy to hear that. A lot of guys are surprisingly clueless about what's involved with a menstrual period, esp when they're not living with a woman. Good for you!", "If he didn't want to know he shouldn't have commented. I'm sorry your having such a bad time. I hope you feel better", "NTA\n\nHe brought it up. And it's incredibly telling that he was only able to get guys on his side", "Dear Lord, what are men.\n\nI'm leaning toward NTA because he clearly has no ground to say \"it's just a little blood\". These sorts of people think they can dismiss and minimize women's pain just because they don't know what it's like and it happens to (most) women every month.", "NTA. and good for you! You gave him some much needed education and corrected his ignorance.", "Nta should have used visual aids", "He is part of the group but not my friend", "What is she the AH for? \n\nAnd question: are you a dude by chance?", "Yes.  Pretty sure habe is not a word in the language this post is in.", "I totally agree.

But we should know we have no idea and not belittle women for dealing with them.", "This plus some other spelling mistakes make me think OP might be German and her phone's spell check is acting up - I know my own is often getting confused when switching languages - and I guess she's not really in shape to go over the post again because of known issues and just wanted to rant (not that I blame her).", "That is interesting (and could be.)  I also think, in general, folks type fast then don't proof read- maybe thinking the phone will do all the work?"]}
