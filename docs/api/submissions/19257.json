{"id": 19257, "submission_id": "143sm06", "title": "AITA for telling my sister I wish I could have a free vacation?", "selftext": "I understand the title makes me sounds entitled so let me explain: One of my sisters loves to travel. Whenever she does she always lets people know where/when in case they want to go with her. She always foots the bill for anyone who joins her.\n\nWhy I have never been able to take her up on her offer? Two reasons. First is that her chosen travel is always (and only) with viking cruises, which do not allow any guests or passengers under age 18. It's not the kind of cruise you might be thinking of. They are marketed to people 60+ focusing on history and culture instead of drinking and partying, but my sister pefers viking exclusively even if though she is still in her late 30s. She is perpetually single, never married and childless so this is not an issue for her. The river cruises she takes are not thousands of people on a big ship on the ocean and my sister only takes viking cruises.\n\nThe second reason is that the cruises are never short or only a week long. They are always ones like 20 days, three weeks, a month etc. Next year she is going on one that is like 25 days long through the Mediterranean and or something. She's a research neurologist and can either take that much time off or do consultations while she travels on the ship. Even if the cruises allowed children I can't take that much time off work and neither can my husband and my kids (ages 5, 7 and 9) can't be off school that long if it's not summer.\n\nI probably sound like I'm whining but I would love for someone to me on a free vacation. But my sister exclusively uses viking cruises for and she doesn't ever buy people vacations for themselves that she's not going on. She doesn't have social media and only talks about her trips if you ask her when she gets back or if she is offering for people who she knows have the time/freedom to go when she is planning. But still. It's annoying to hear about others getting to go with her. I guess I'm just annoyed because I found out about her latest trip today because I heard she's taking my aunt and uncle. I have asked about taking other vacations but she always says no.\n\nWhen I found out about this latest vacation I said it would be nice to get a free vacation. She just rolled her eyes but my mum got upset with me later and said it was uncalled for. It's easy for her to say because my sister has taken my parents on vacation before. It might sound petty but I'm tired of finding out about free vacations that I can't go on. My mum is still really upset at me and we argued because she said I was wrong to say what I said.", "created_utc": 1686180497, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143sm06/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_wish_i_could_have_a/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe she doesn\u2019t want kids on her vacation and again that\u2019s her right. She\u2019s living her best life. You sound jealous .

Why would your sister buy vacations for people that she is not going on? Why would your sister give up the vacations she obviously loves so someone else can get the vacation they want at her expense? You have both chosen different lifestyles so stop being resentful and jealous of hers. You and your husband both have jobs. Save up and take your kids on the type of vacation you want. \n\nViking Cruises are great and perfect for childless people or people whose children have flown the nest.

No. I am glad she enjoys them and look forward to hearing all about them and seeing the pictures.", "YTA\u2014you and your husband CHOSE to have the responsibility of children while your sister didn\u2019t. You\u2019re jealous because she has the money to go on trips while YOU chose to use that money on your family instead. It\u2019s not your sister\u2019s fault YOU wanted to procreate 3 TIMES instead of saving money and going on cruises instead. Get over yourself. You are NOT entitled to a \u201cfree\u201d vacation.", "Yta you could have a free vacation, you're choosing not to. Which makes sense at this point in your life.\n\nBut yes, bitching about her offer of a free vacation not being good enough does make you an ahole.", "YTA please stop being selfish and entitled", "YTA.  You sound petty, jealous and entitled.  If your sister really wanted to vacation with you she could book a shorter river cruise and encourage you to have your husband and mother stay with the children.  The fact that she doesn't should tell you something.", "YTA- and you don\u2019t understand the point of these \u201cfree trips.\u201d They are a chance for your sister to share experiences with people she cares in a luxury and educational setting. She\u2019s giving people a rare and amazing gift of travel and she\u2019s not sparing an expense. Instead of being entitled and complaining, show interest and one day she may share travel with you and your kids when they grow up and you may really enjoy it. But the way you\u2019re behaving, I\u2019d write you off. A family member took me on a Viking tour for my college graduation and I LOVED it! It was AMAZING, and I saw a lot, learned a lot, and I grew up with little and that trip was the most incredible gift. I didn\u2019t feel entitled to it, didn\u2019t expect it, but I sure did appreciate it. Be a better sibling, apologize and say you feel left out but your happy she gets to do so many cool things and hope she forgives you for being such a brat.", "YTA- Nobody owes you anything. And I was going to give you a tiny bit of sympathy, until you mentioned your husband and 3 kids. That's why you never get asked. If it was just you and husband, maybe you would get asked. But, you sound like you are expecting a free vacation for your whole family. And cruising with kids isn't cheap. There are no rate discounts for kids.", "This post makes me want to travel using Viking cruises so thanks for the tip!\n\nYTA", "YTA", "You are jealous of your sister\u2019s child free freedom and finances. Your sister is paying for her vacation as well as someone to go with her. Stop being petty. Would you honestly want to trade places with her? Tell your husband you need a child free vacation and find a sitter. Find your own joy.", "I\u2019ll send you my bank details, and you can send me money for me to take my family on a vacation. \n\n\nDoes that seem entirely ridiculous to you? Good, now you know how you sound. \n\nYTA", "YTA and this should also make its way to r/choosingbeggars", "YTA \nYou know who else doesn't get free vacations ? Your sister.", "I get it. You\u2019re sad you can\u2019t have a free vacation. i\u2019m similar in that I\u2019m younger than a sibling whose kids are grown and they sometimes take my other siblings (also with adult kids) on free vacations. I have just been saving my own fund and just took an awesome kid friendly cruise. It was amazing. I paid for it but that\u2019s what most people do. So few people get free vacations. I get why you\u2019re disappointed but YTA. I never mention it to my sibling and unfollowed them on social media so my feelings don\u2019t get hurt", " YTA. It isn\u2019t up to your sister to furnish you a free vacation. You are petty and jealous of her and anyone that go on trips with her", "YTA. Just because she is taking others on trips with her that she was already going on doesn\u2019t make you entitled to your own free trip. She doesn\u2019t need to go out of her way to plan a trip that will accommodate you and your family. She plans trips for herself, and then asks others if they want to join her.", "So YTA, because it\u2019s not your sister who stops you from going on free vacations, it\u2019s you.\n\nYou\u2019re complaining to your sister and your family about a problem that you created. You got married, you had children, you can\u2019t leave them, you can\u2019t take time off work. \n\nIf you were willing to take the time off work and leave your kids behind I bet your sister would love to take you with her. \n\nWhat you need to realize is that there is NO SUCH THING as a free vacation. You always sacrifice something. Your sister agrees to sacrifice the money, you have to sacrifice the obligations at home if you want to go, the same as your other family members.", "YTA your right you sound entitled. \n\nWhat I am about to say may sound harsh. But have you ever thought maybe she takes these vacations  and says no to any other kind because she doesn\u2019t want to vacation with kids. You have 3 ages 5-9.  I don\u2019t care how will behaved you think they are. A lot of adults (even adults who have grown kids) don\u2019t want to vacation with kids. They don\u2019t find it fun. \n\nBut either way you are not entitled to a free vacation. Stop asking. Because you are going to make it wheee she avoids you. Your mom is right it\u2019s rude.", "YTA and extremely entitled.", "YTA. You remind me so much of my old coworker who constantly told me how lucky I was to not have kids and to have 2 full time incomes with my spouse so we could \"enjoy life.\" She was extremely bitter about her 2 kids and deadbeat partner who couldn't hold a job, but instead of reflecting on her own life choices, she chose to resent me because of mine. The first couple times I thought she just wanted to vent and I lent a sympathetic ear, but she was exhausting to be around and she never dropped it even when I started ignoring her. I regretted ever being nice to her. Do you remember reading about the \"green-eyed monster\" as a kid? It's not a good look. Accept that your sister lives a different lifestyle than you and focus on making your own life better, instead of being jealous of hers.", "[deleted]", "Wow, that's really tough. Family and friends should be able to trust one another. Everyone's feelings should be respected.

Then it is for paying for 5 extra people doing something you hate and don\u2019t want to do.\n\nEven adults who have adult kids don\u2019t want to spend thier vacation with kids under 18. There is nothing wrong with that. And the sister should not be expected to pay for something she would not enjoy doing!", "Op is not entitled to a free cruise. No matter who the sister  takes pats for she still isn\u2019t entitled to a free vacation. \n\nBut op doesn\u2019t just want a free vacation for herself. She wants a free vacation for a family of 5. That\u2019s a whole lot different in just paying for 2 people. \n\nPlus read between the lines. Sister only vacation on a cruise ship that doesn\u2019t allow anyone under 18. She doesn\u2019t want to vacation with kids. Op has 3 kids. \n\nSister can take who she want. Op needs to suck it up and quit being rude and entitled.", "I bet you're just as entitled as OP is.", "For real. I\u2019ve always thought cruises sounded awful but this quiet, adults-only historically focused one sounds very nice. I also thought at first it was a Viking *themed* cruise, like medieval times but on the water with Vikings and that also piqued my interest \ud83d\ude02", "My parents absolutely love their Viking cruises but you have to check the water levels in the rivers of the areas you\u2019re interested in - if they\u2019re low you have to get off the ship for legs of the trip and take a bus.", "They have shitty payment policies - they often want full payment a year in advance. If you want adults only, check out Virgin.", "It totally reads like one.", "I want to go. I now also think I am going to find a Viking cruise. Op had me when she said no one under 18.", "I just want to raid coastal villages then go slam mimosas on a deck", "Viking also has ocean cruises.", "It sounds like a dream come true! Vacation, culture, no    spawn", "The vibe that I am getting is that OP is resentful that she followed the \"fairy tale\" life script (husband, kids, etc.) and her sister didn't, I think that is why she described her as, *\"perpetually single, never married and childless.\"*  Thats some harsh judgement right there and from experience people that judge that harshly are usually jealous. \n\nYou're mentioning that she takes Viking Cruises, that focus on history and culture, instead of partying like Virgin cruises, which also don't allow anyone under 18, even though she's in her 30's, sounds like you envy her, because she is young and unencumbered and not living the party life, it sounds like that's probably what you would be doing.  Also, that she doesn't have social media, (that you know of), and will only talk if you ask about her trips, tells me that she's private and doesn't like a lot of people in her business.\n\nLastly, maybe she takes the long cruises because she knows that you and your family can't go,   \n it's easier than telling you no and hear you whine. If you want to take a cruise, Disney, that is the cruise line for you. If you start saving now, you'll be able to go in about 3 years. \n\nYTA.", "Hahaha I can\u2019t get over how jealous and low rent you sound. Sorry your sister has some god damn culture and you\u2026well.., frankly my dear you lack it as well as grace and knowing when to keep your simple opinions to yourself. YTA. YOUR ARE JEALOUS and obviously very basic.", "YTA. You are so entitled\u2026 time to reflect sweetie. Diana Ross and the supremes had a fantastic hit in 1967 called reflections\u2026 go listen and reflect asap.", "NAH. It doesn't sound like you're demanding a free vacation, it just is your reality.\n\nYour sister is incredibly generous and it's not fair to expect her to pay for vacations that she's not personally into.\n\nThe only caveat that I'll add is that the word free here is incredibly destructive. It's not Free. Your sister is forking out her hard earned money for companionship (for either before or during the cruise)", "YTA", "Yes, it does sound petty. She\u2019s offering you a free vacation, but your schedule/circumstances do not allow you to take it. Can see how that would be disappointing. But why is it her problem? Why is she hearing your whining? What did she do other than offer you something that you weren\u2019t in a position to accept? YTA.", "YTA and so tacky for this. Do yourself a favor and reflect.", "YTA, me me me.\n\nShe take a specific holiday she enjoys , She pays if someone wants to join her, She is lucky enough to take long holidays.\n\nYou complain about the type of holiday she takes, you complain about the length of holiday she take, you complain about her taking other people who appreciates the trips with her.\n\nYou and her have made different life choices and as a result have very different lives. Whilst you feel jealous it is not your sisters responsibility to gift you and your family a free vacation.", "I think we can all agree that it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but your own that you got married and did not become a research biologist. You could be in Cancun or at Disney or whatever other trashy vacation you want every other month for the rest of your life, but you chose poorly, and now you\u2019re blaming someone else. \n\nYTA. Majorly.", "YTA. When I read the part about not allowing people under 18, I thought, oh, OP is a teenager whose social skills may have been stunted during lockdown and they don\u2019t get how truly generous their sister is. That\u2019s how immature it was. Then when I read you not only HAD kids but expected her to foot the bill so you could take them\u2026 actually revoltingly entitled. How would this not be entitled?", "Gentle YTA for all the reasons other stated but I feel you. It\u2019s hard when I\u2019m living paycheck to paycheck and just want to have one enjoyable experience without going into debt so I kinda resonate with your frustration. Nothing is handed to us in this world and it would be lovely if your sister showed you a little compassion and bought you a short trip but she pays for others so she has company on HER vacation not just because she wants people to have experiences. This is her money and she can do what she wants so get over it and find contentment in what little \u201cvacations\u201d from real life you can do. \n\nIt will be worse if you can afford a vacation and you just want a free one tho. Then I take back all my gentleness.", "OMG YTA you want your sister to not just take you but your husband and your 3 kids and you want her to adjust according to you?? Your time and your schedule and what you want to do and also to pay for it all. If you want a free vacation so bad go join her in what shes planned because that's how everyone else got to go! And if you can't too bad.", "YTA. All I could think the whole time I was reading this was \"dude, shut up.\"\n\nYour sister doesn't owe anyone a free vacation. Clearly she likes the viking cruises and she likes having family accompany her enough that it's worth it for her to pay for people to come along. It's her money that she's spending on an activity she enjoys as well as quality time with family. Why do you feel she should spend her money to go on a different vacation if this is what she likes? And how could you possibly think that she should pay for you to go on a solo vacation?? It's not like she's just handing out wads of cash and decided \"none for OP!\"\n\nStop asking her for a vacation. If you can't take her up on her offer, I get it, that sucks. And yeah, it's probably frustrating to see or hear about other people enjoying their free vacations. But that's part of life and it's not her problem. There will always be people who have more than you, and you just have to be able to deal with that. It's rude and entitled to keep asking her to change her plans to accommodate you or basically just give you money.\n\nAlso, after reading your post, I really don't get any sense that you even have any interest in going on a viking cruise. You really seem to dislike them. So what's the issue? Aside from the fact that it's free, what are you so upset about missing out on? \n\nTLDR: Respectfully, get over yourself.", "YTA why should she pay for a vacation she doesn't want to go on. If I'm paying then you do what I pay for.", "If you wanna go so bad, make it happen, you\u2019re just giving excuses to why you can\u2019t go and haven\u2019t even tried to arrange to go on a vacation pay for your own damn vacation or shut up", "Yta", "YTA. You want a free vacation,  you want it on your own terms, and you're whining to your sister about providing it. She can do whatever whe wants with her money and if she's generous enough to invite you along at her expense, you take it or leave it. Talk about r/choosingbeggars...", "You really need to ask if yta? Like really really? You sound super jelly. You and your hubby and save for your own vacation. Leave your sister alone.", "Probably because she is \"perpetually single, never married and childless\"\n\nOP must be under the impression that because her sister chose a different path in life, she owes OP some of the benefits of those life choices. Like giving them expensive presents because she doesn't have kids so what's she going to spend money on, anyway?\n\nr/Ok-Lobster7176 for your information, it's \"childfree\", not \"childless\" if it's by choice.", "OP sounds like the kind of person that would go on vacation and ask other people on vacation also to babysit", "This is where my head really tilted\u2026 she expected her sister to pay for all of them?!?! I bet she even expects her sister to give them spending money too", "I always get advertising from them on Instagram, now I\u2019m super tempted. Sounds wonderful and peaceful.\n\nAnd yeah OP YTA, abs you don\u2019t sound like those things, you are those things. \n\nFind something to make extra cash to afford your own damn vacation and quit complaining. Sis didn\u2019t force you into the life you chose."]}
