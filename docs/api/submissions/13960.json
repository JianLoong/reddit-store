We struggled to have children for a long time (9 years) and had our twins via IVF. It was a long battle to have our babies and when we chose their names it was something we not only took seriously, but poured a lot of love into because we knew they would be the only children we would name. We chose the first names Ezra and Esme for the twins. Their middle names are more uncommon so we won't share. But what I will say is part of what went into the choice for these names was the length. Growing up I had a long last name (10 letters) and my parents gave me very formal and lengthy first and middle names (Frederick Lawrence) and I always found my name very stuffy and old fashioned. I go by a nn derived from my middle name now. I also took my wife's much simpler last name when we married.\n\nSo we announced the name of our twins when they were a day old and when we announced the names we were aware my parents might not be in love with them, but I stupidly believed the twins being born would be enough of a deterrent for a negative comment. About a week after they were born my parents asked what kind of names they had and how could we give them such juvenile and incomplete names. I told them they were neither of those things and they needed to be careful about how they spoke about their grandchildren's names.\n\nI thought they had listened but then in January they started calling them Winifred and Douglas. At first we weren't positive they were talking about the twins but then we were celebrating my niece's 10th birthday and my parents directly addressed my daughter as Winifred and I knew it was them they were talking to. I told them those were not their names. They said those were nicknames they had given them and everyone has a nickname, that it's not like we gave them names that could lend themselves to nicknames. I said Ezzie and Essie if they really wanted nicknames. They ignored me and they continued to use the \"nicknames\". So we decided not to be around, because on top of that they were telling my siblings that the names they had chosen were better for my children. My siblings thought they were crazy. My parents tried to see the kids a few times since and I always told them no. They asked why and I told them they do not get to see our children if all they can do is insult their names. My parents accused me of trying to control them and said nicknames are a part of life. I told them what they had done wasn't giving a nickname, it was renaming my children in their own heads and my wife and I do not want them renaming them. I also said we will not further encourage the use of the \"nicknames\" they gave them. My parents said if I had stuck to the family way of naming babies none of this would be happening and they said I was being unfair to them.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680601058, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bdtue/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_my_wife_and_i_do/", "score": 577, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you gave little to no attention to the nicknames they would likely just go away. Your parents are not being sensitive enough to your requests, but they are just excited to be grandparents. \n\nI have a very stupid first name. My whole life I have had a ton of nicknames. My grandma calls me a name not even related to my name - it\u2019s very sweet and endearing and only my grandma calls me that. My siblings all call me something different because with being a stupid name it\u2019s hard to pronounce correctly as you have to be able to roll your tongue to say it right. \n\nWhat happens when your children want to change their names for themselves, will you be upset then? Or when their friends give them nicknames. \n\nI just feel like you\u2019re putting too much emphasis on a name. It\u2019s just a name.

Those are completely two different names. I'd tell my parents that they could either call them by those names or not see the kids at all. I know people who have taken offense to much less.

And got some bs about it being easier because he didn't remember my name . I pointed out that he remembered my name just fine untill now . And got more bs about it just being quicker . So I asked how is it quicker if I ignore you untill you use my name ? So days went by of me straight up ignoring him nomatter what he said unless he used my name.\n\nThis didn't slow him down though for some time he would call me Dave again and again and then ask why I was ignoring him .

So I started calling him random old lady names Infront of other managers and customers, I'd address him as Edna, Gladice, Dorothy, Brenda and boy did he hate that . I simply said you set the tone here Linda if you can call me Dave I can call you Eriene and walked off .\n\nThis game went on for easily another 2 weeks.
