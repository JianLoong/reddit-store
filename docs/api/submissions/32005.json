Or better yet, don\u2019t go to class if you don\u2019t want to learn.", "YTA. Constant movement on a computer screen is very distracting for other students that want to concentrate on the class. You could have at least moved to the back side of the class. Also, you tell him not to poke you because of your autism, but you don\u2019t think ADD is a good reason to just ask to stop distracting him? Please, grow up.", "YTA if you're bored it doesn't mean it's okay to do anything distracting to other students. Sit at the back if you want to play during class. It's what we were doing when I was at your place and we never bothered anyone.", "As much as I love a good game of disability olympics - YTA. You have like 3 hours of lecture a day in college, often less. Maybe pay attention. After college, you'll be expected to be on the ball for 7-8 hours a day, sometimes more. If you can't buckle up for a few hours a day now, you're going to have a really bad time then. \"But it's boring and slow.\" Wait until you see how boring an actual job is; despite that, you'll still be expected to pay attention. Start preparing yourself now by cultivating some discipline and focus, and stop being a blatant distraction to those who actually went to class to learn.\n\nMaybe you're footing the bill yourself, but probably not. If you have a benefactor, they probably wouldn't be stoked to learn you're playing Roblox during your lectures, which could be costing them hundreds of dollars an hour.", "YTA. He asked you to stop distracting him in his college class where he pays a lot to learn.

Apologize to that student and pray that he doesn't take it up with the professor because basically every college class starts with don't be fucking around online as it is distracting to others. If you want to waste your time and money do it in the back of class or just don't go.", "Jesus, this insanity has gone so far it's just funny. \n\nPeople out here trying to one up other people with their made up disabilities.

Sort yourself out.", "YTA you're in class to learn, not play video games.", "YTA.  Class is for concentrating on learning the material being presented.  You already know how distracting playing Roblox in class is, because it happened to you.", "YTA. It's distracting for everyone around you and disrespectful to your classmates and the professor. You're presumably paying a lot to attend college, pay attention. This kind of thing can also cause a professor to ban laptops entirely (happened to me more than once).", "NAH, you both have reasons for your personal actions... Personally, I would just move seats to avoid any additional issues.", "If you\u2019re bored in class just leave. Seat at the back if you want to play in class, so you won\u2019t distract other students. YTA", "YTA I think I speak for the average college student when I say calc 3 is not the class for those kinds of distractions /: do it on your own time or move to the back. I\u2019m almost certain you are bothering other students as well, they just won\u2019t say it.\n\nAlso the guy has the option to go to the prof if you continue, getting in trouble with your prof is not worth it for some Roblox fun.", "YTA it is distracting to other students. The other student could file an ADA complaint against you ans get you kicked out if class.", "NTA, but you should move to the back of the classroom. I played Tetris, 2064, and other random games on my laptop when I was bored in uninformative 3-hour lectures in college. It actually helped me listen better to have something mindless to do with my hands. However, I always sat in the back of the class so I wouldn't distract anyone.", "YTA\n\nWell guess who is going to email the professor now. \n\nIf you\u2019re so bored, don\u2019t go to class", "NTA but I think you could approach this much differently. \n\nThe complicating/ interesting bit for me is that you are autistic. Is playing games part of your stimming/coping techniques? If you need this, I would recommend sitting in the back row so you don't distract others while you work yourself out. \n\nI have ADD and I would be easily distracted by this, so I understand him. But I would move seats, rather than make you accommodate me. Really, this would be solved by either one of you just moving seats. It's college- seats aren't assigned. \n\nFWIW, I also have a degree in engineering and have taken Calc 3. Props to both of you for doing what you can to get through the grind. Try to be an asset to each other if you can.", "Just leave the class and play the game. I seriously doubt you're too smart for calc 3 so maybe pay attention? \n\nYou posting this stupid interaction is suggestive of deeper problems for you.", "Nta he can move to another seat", "Nta.  The guy behind you needs to mind his own business.  His concentration level is not your problem, it is his.  If you were being noisy or something that would be different.", "YTA for this, and also I think it\u2019s probably time to find a game that\u2019s not for literal children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You and everybody else in that class are PAYING to be there.  It's called respect.  If you are distracting others, YOU need to move and let them focus on the lecture.  Just because someone else was playing a game in a different class doesn't give you the go ahead to play a game in this class.  That's 3rd grade logic coming from a 21 year old adult.", "Are you paying for college yourself? \n\nIf not YTA, because either your parents, taxpayers or some generous person spent money for you to be there.\n\nIf your paying 100% then sit in the back and do what you want.", "YTA. Be respectful to your classmates.", "Yes YTA. You're there to learn. Bored or otherwise you should give the professor your attention. Playing games is highly disrespectful to the professor, and your fellow students.", "YTA for multiple annoying reasons lol", "yta. i have asd as well, the best way to avoid unwanted contact for being inconsiderate is to not be inconsiderate in the first place. if you were bored enough to play roblox you could've left to play roblox at home. you're not the only one affected by playing roblox in class (obviously) and definitely not the only one paying for the class. just because you want to waste your money on not paying attention doesn't mean everyone else in the class feels the same way.", "Whenever I had a class that I was gonna like half pay attention in I would make sure to sit in the back to not distract anyone else", "I'm guessing this is one of those classes where extra teachers are required to stop the inmates eating the glue and crayons?", "YTA for sure. \n\nNot focusing on the lecture is fine, everyone has their mind wander from time to time. But someone specifically interrupted you to tell you that it was distracting them. \nAt that point, you apologise and stop. If you want to continue playing, you are free to leave the lecture theatre to do so. You're not engaged in the lecture so you're not missing out on anything by not being there, but being there and distracting other people is being unnecessarily disruptive.\n\nAlso, you can't expect people to make allowances to accommodate your autism, while also not making allowances to accommodate their ADD. There is nothing that makes you the main character of reality and everyone else's lives are flavourtext in your story.", "Well I have DID you weren't even talking to me, that was Patricia and she tells me you're very rude \ud83e\udd23", "lol!! Was thinking the along the same lines. I have this. I have that. Everyone bend to my needs\u2026 blah blah blah.\n\nNTA. If you want to play Roblox in class, that\u2019s your prerogative.

I don\u2019t even had ADD, but in one of my classes the guy in front of me would constantly watch stupid bodybuilding videos and I literally could not help but watch along because it was the only thing moving in the room.", "Yep.", "Will defend OP, we do not know if she is or isn't diagnosed, we can't assume it's self disgnosed", "Nope. Not legally. Nice try", "I mean, you are asking a person with autism at this point to have empathy and understanding of other people's feelings and issues, which is something most autistic people struggle with \n\n(I am saying this from my experience of managing several autistic people, being managed by an autistic CEO, having two autistic children and worked with autistic children in education)", "Which law would that be?"]}
