She's spent all this time referring to you as \"dad\", but now it's Steve, and she says it's unconscious and she can't help it? That's not how people's brains work. I get that it's now a habit, and perhaps it is very hard for her to remember, but that does not explain why she started on the first place.\n\nIt's like she is trying to create distance between you and the kids. Perhaps she is having insecure feelings about her relationship with the kids? Have you been having issues or disagreements with her lately? Especially about the kids?  Have you asked her WHY she started calling you your first name instead of just telling her to stop? I  would if I were you.", "NTA. It could honestly be just a slip though.

She isn't slipping up or forgetting. She only recently started using your given name.

Honestly, if it weren\u2019t for confusing the kids, I would do it right back to her and let her see how it feels.\n\nThere\u2019s no way she isn\u2019t doing this on purpose.  It\u2019s so counterintuitive and weird.", "A little shocked by all the responses here. I\u2019m going with NAH.
