You are their Dad, but you're not Mum's Dad. \n\nWhen children are little, their language acquisition comes through mimicry - they call things what they hear them called. That tends to be when a wife will refer to her husband as \"Dad,\" and then the children grow, and it isn't necessary anymore. Kids know that dad, grandma etc are relationship descriptors rather than first names. It's part of why kids so often are a slip at school and inadvertently call their teacher \"mum\" at school.\n\n\"Your dad\" can be a term people use either in blended families (and tends to imply there are different dads involved \"your dad\" as compared to \"your brothers dad.\") Or Co-parenting relationships )and can have a \"I'm being polite about this person because he is your dad, and special to you, even though he isn't particularly anyone special to me any more\" tones).  For some people, \"your Dad\" is more distant than just calling someone by their  name.\n\nThis is handled differently in different families. To me, it's a bit odd that someone wants their wife to call them Dad - hopefully, your relationship with your wife is certainly different to your relationship with your kids. \n \nYou're not your wife's father.

This is the first time that I hear something about parents not using mom/dad (or similar) when referring to each other to their children. Like for 99% of TV shows (at least in the USa and Mexico) parents say your dad,your mom, grampa, and speaking to their children. On the dew shows that break this trend , it's to show rebellion ( think about how on the Simpsons, Liza and Bart always say mom when referring to Marge, but Bart will sometimes refer to his dad as Homer either when he is disagreeing with him or seeing him as not his stupid father) . That 70s show is the only other one where all characters use names or nicknames to refer to each other including parents and kids. \n\nAlso its not about the wife calling him dad when they speak with each other, it's about cultural respect and instilling importance onto the children for their parents. \n\nAlso you would probably hate Spanish speakers, between siblings we will say \"mi mam\u00e1\" Aka my mother when speaking with our brothers and sister.

You would have noticed if she'd been doing it for years. I would start digging deeper, looking for any indications she's on her way out the door.
