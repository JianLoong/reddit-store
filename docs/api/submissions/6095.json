If they complain that it\u2019s only \u00a33 then let them know that if it\u2019s so insignificant they shouldn\u2019t have any trouble paying it and point out that when you frequently host people it adds up for you.", "Very mild YTA.  The rules are different when you're young and crashing on someone's couch on short notice vs. making a formal visit to someone's home where the plan is for you to spend at least 1 night.  But the polite thing to do is offer someone a blanket (not a whole set of sheets and whatever) and a towel if they want to shower in the morning.  No shade on collecting the laundering fee for this, but you should make the marginal effort to make a guest comfortable.", "Must be an age thing. But crashing at an adults home includes bedding and toiletries.  But being broke and still offering a place to crash is kind so ...\n\nNAH", "The only reason I'm leaning towards you are is because you lied about it.

And you really expect someone not to shower after a night of partying and drinking? WTF?", "NTA\n\nIf your friends want you to start providing fresh sheets and towels then you can start charging them to stay there.\n\nYou're poor and they're lucky that they can stay there.

Thats not hospitality.", "NTA Is there any way you can explain to them the cost of having guests? If they are your actual friends they should understand you can't provide free housing for the night due to your financial situation. Requesting like \u00a33 for help towards laundry and whatever amount towards water is completely reasonable and any good friend will see that.

And it isn't \"wasteful\" to provide your guests with the things they need to be guests. \n\nYou truly should have just given them the basics they needed, and then going forward, you can be more clear with your friends about the expectations of staying at your place. You didn't clearly communicate to them those expectations, and now realize that you all may have different expectations of being a guest.

Seriously, it they\u2019re just going home in the same dirty clothes from the night before, a shower seems pointless.", "I would say NAH, because the guest wasn't an asshole to ask for this.
