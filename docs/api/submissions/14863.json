While publicly discussing a work function was not the appropriate time.", "ESH.\n\nBy \"safekeep my place\" I assume you mean housesitting.  John is the AH for disregarding your wishes and letting a dog in the room. \n\nI'm confused about something though. Do you own both dogs and cats? And only the cats you own are allowed in the room?\n\nBut your punishment seems strange. Certainly, you wouldn't want him to look after your place again. But why ban him from coming over? He won't be alone in your home; you'll be there. I agree with your sister that's overreacting. \n\nAnd it sounds like you didn't bring it up until the dinner event came up. Why hadn't you mentioned it sooner? He would hardly know there was a problem since you said nothing on your return. And there was no need to call him out in front of all your coworkers.", "Going against the grain with ESH.\n\nLooking past the fact that your instructions about not having animals in the room was disregarded (We all forget rules sometimes )\n\n It sounds like maybe the disconnect is more a combination of your coworkers lack of understanding and education regarding the seriousness and severity of your sons autism/sensory problem is. Possibly mixed with a  lack of educating him on your end and I see how this could have happened with no ill intention on mind. \n\n I just think people are quick to assume others have a full grasp/ same level of understanding we do when it comes to something that's such a large part of our everyday life. \nPeople also seem to have trouble grasping and really understanding amd empathizing with how something so completely mundane to them can have such a profound effect on someone else and that is is out of their control. I find this is especially true with mental or emotional problems.", "ESH - John is an obvious asshole here, but you\u2019re an asshole and likely embarrassed yourself for how you handled it.\n\nYou both owe each other an apology.", " ESH but you a little more. The coworker should have respected boundaries. I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t say NO PETS though. That probably led the coworker to think it was less of a big deal.\n\nBut you\u2019re mainly the asshole for waiting to bring up your issue in a public, dramatic fashion. You knew you were being a jerk. Literally SO immature to stay silent and wait to have a party and tell the coworker in from of everyone \u201cwell YOU aren\u2019t invited!\u201d That\u2019s like some grade school bully shit. Grow up!", "EITA\n\nYea, you overreacted.  But it's your kid.  It would have been better to explain the consequences of his actions to him and make it clear that whether he agreed or not in principle doesn't matter.  He effectively harmed your child in your home.  And, because of that, he will not have to opportunity again. \n\nHaving said that, I'm not sure it was a good idea to publicly call him out at work.  Or, for that matter, to exclude him from company events.  Presumably, you don't own the company.  So, this was not really your place.  Just make sure he is no longer allowed unsupervised in your home.", "NTA: OP, your coworker had absolutely no reason to let his dirty, wet dog spend time in your son's room.

They wouldn\u2019t be autistic. Do people not realize that?", "You're definitely NTA. What John did was incredibly inconsiderate, and it shows a lack of respect for your son's needs and abilities. You set clear boundaries and John completely disregarded them, causing an extremely stressful situation for your son and leaving you to handle the aftermath. That's a serious breach of trust, and you were fully justified in banning John from your house and future events.

Op has every right to not allow him into her home.", "wtf", "But why not tell the coworker to not go into the room or allow animals in the room? Even allowing cats OR your coworker in the room seems problematic. Cats can have accidents (spraying or potty accidents, especially if they are in an unfamiliar space). There's no reason from my view you couldn't have told him it was off limits due to the potential for problems.", "Perhaps a quick sign \" Keep this door closed at all times.\"  I mean, it's ridiculous to have to police a grown man.  But, it's better than the alternative.", "Why did he enter the room? Do you have a dog or did he bring one over?", "Autistic people typically want to stray away from labels period. It should be just they are autistic, here are their symptoms, the end. \n\nFunctioning labels put us in boxes and aren\u2019t accurate. They\u2019re based on how we\u2019re seen externally, not how we feel internally. Most people don\u2019t realize I\u2019m autistic for the first few months of knowing me, I would be considered \u201chigh functioning\u201d except because of my autism I couldn\u2019t work for years and my emotional dysregulation was so bad I was suicidal for years. I was no where near \u201chigh functioning\u201d but because I\u2019m verbal and you can\u2019t tell by looking at me I\u2019m given that label. It was always very frustrating because it meant people expected things from me that I could never ever follow through with.\n\nMedicine and education are still really far behind when it comes to autism knowledge and care. I would suggest joining communities of autistic people that can teach you first hand.", "The popular phrase is \"don't sh!t where you eat\"", "He would be allowed inside Faisol's room to close and open windows, turn off the cable at night, and that is it. I could not have blocked his access but I made the point to never allow any animals or dirty/smelly objects inside", "Case in point, I visited my aunt when I was younger. She had a VERY well behaved cat who I loved, but he got a little stressed because a new person was in the house. We came back from shopping my second day there and he had pooped on my pillow and in the sink. We just closed the door from then on.", "Yes! Look into the social model of autism instead of medical. Autism \"research\" has put back autism acceptance about 50 years", "And on this sub the phrase is \"My house, My rules\"", "But you told him cats would be allowed inside? Perhaps I don't understand the cable thing, can you explain what that means? And why do windows have to be opened and closed in that room? \n\nOverall I am going to go with ESH for judgment, because it seems like you could have told him to not enter the room or allow any animals, but you told him cats could go inside which could have caused just as big of an issue as a dog. Calling him out in front of coworkers was also not OK.  On his part, he did not listen to your instructions, and a dog did go into the room.\n\nUltimately if there are major clean area issues in your house, it is probably unwise to have coworkers bring animals over where accidents and smells can occur.", "We have the habit to turn off the internet cable before bed to save on money. We also leave all windows slightly open for a few hours of the day", "I'm guessing this is not in the U.S.? Is the internet cable/router in Faisol's room? Also, is the \"habit\" of leaving the windows open and/or turning off the cable a hard and fast rule, or could it be amended for a few days to prevent people/animals from entering the room of your son, who has issues with any change to his environment?", "We need to do it so we don't overheat the house because of the very hot temperatures here. The internet cable is in his room. We cannot stop doing it, else it might actually be dangerous", "Dangerous how?", "Excess of heat inside the house damages appliances. We really get very hot weather and it's usually practice to open windows during major heat hours", "NTA\n\nAnd I cannot believe the callousness of your sister.  Perhaps, she's jealous of the attention Faisol receives?

I wouldn't bring somebody like that back into the house.", "NTA but your sister and co-worker is.  They clearly don't understand, for those of us on the spectrum, our senses can be incredibly sensitive and you simply can't just 'get over it'.
