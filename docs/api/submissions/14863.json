While publicly discussing a work function was not the appropriate time.", "ESH.\n\nBy \"safekeep my place\" I assume you mean housesitting.  John is the AH for disregarding your wishes and letting a dog in the room. \n\nI'm confused about something though. Do you own both dogs and cats? And only the cats you own are allowed in the room?\n\nBut your punishment seems strange. Certainly, you wouldn't want him to look after your place again. But why ban him from coming over? He won't be alone in your home; you'll be there. I agree with your sister that's overreacting. \n\nAnd it sounds like you didn't bring it up until the dinner event came up. Why hadn't you mentioned it sooner? He would hardly know there was a problem since you said nothing on your return. And there was no need to call him out in front of all your coworkers.", "Going against the grain with ESH.\n\nLooking past the fact that your instructions about not having animals in the room was disregarded (We all forget rules sometimes )\n\n It sounds like maybe the disconnect is more a combination of your coworkers lack of understanding and education regarding the seriousness and severity of your sons autism/sensory problem is. Possibly mixed with a  lack of educating him on your end and I see how this could have happened with no ill intention on mind. \n\n I just think people are quick to assume others have a full grasp/ same level of understanding we do when it comes to something that's such a large part of our everyday life. \nPeople also seem to have trouble grasping and really understanding amd empathizing with how something so completely mundane to them can have such a profound effect on someone else and that is is out of their control.

The coworker should have respected boundaries. I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t say NO PETS though. That probably led the coworker to think it was less of a big deal.\n\nBut you\u2019re mainly the asshole for waiting to bring up your issue in a public, dramatic fashion. You knew you were being a jerk. Literally SO immature to stay silent and wait to have a party and tell the coworker in from of everyone \u201cwell YOU aren\u2019t invited!\u201d That\u2019s like some grade school bully shit. Grow up!", "EITA\n\nYea, you overreacted.  But it's your kid.  It would have been better to explain the consequences of his actions to him and make it clear that whether he agreed or not in principle doesn't matter.  He effectively harmed your child in your home.  And, because of that, he will not have to opportunity again. \n\nHaving said that, I'm not sure it was a good idea to publicly call him out at work.  Or, for that matter, to exclude him from company events.  Presumably, you don't own the company.  So, this was not really your place.  Just make sure he is no longer allowed unsupervised in your home.", "NTA: OP, your coworker had absolutely no reason to let his dirty, wet dog spend time in your son's room.

You set clear boundaries and John completely disregarded them, causing an extremely stressful situation for your son and leaving you to handle the aftermath.

Op has every right to not allow him into her home.", "wtf", "But why not tell the coworker to not go into the room or allow animals in the room? Even allowing cats OR your coworker in the room seems problematic. Cats can have accidents (spraying or potty accidents, especially if they are in an unfamiliar space). There's no reason from my view you couldn't have told him it was off limits due to the potential for problems.", "Perhaps a quick sign \" Keep this door closed at all times.\"  I mean, it's ridiculous to have to police a grown man.  But, it's better than the alternative.", "Why did he enter the room? Do you have a dog or did he bring one over?", "Autistic people typically want to stray away from labels period. It should be just they are autistic, here are their symptoms, the end. \n\nFunctioning labels put us in boxes and aren\u2019t accurate. They\u2019re based on how we\u2019re seen externally, not how we feel internally. Most people don\u2019t realize I\u2019m autistic for the first few months of knowing me, I would be considered \u201chigh functioning\u201d except because of my autism I couldn\u2019t work for years and my emotional dysregulation was so bad I was suicidal for years. I was no where near \u201chigh functioning\u201d but because I\u2019m verbal and you can\u2019t tell by looking at me I\u2019m given that label. It was always very frustrating because it meant people expected things from me that I could never ever follow through with.\n\nMedicine and education are still really far behind when it comes to autism knowledge and care. I would suggest joining communities of autistic people that can teach you first hand.", "The popular phrase is \"don't sh!t where you eat\"", "He would be allowed inside Faisol's room to close and open windows, turn off the cable at night, and that is it.

She had a VERY well behaved cat who I loved, but he got a little stressed because a new person was in the house. We came back from shopping my second day there and he had pooped on my pillow and in the sink. We just closed the door from then on.", "Yes! Look into the social model of autism instead of medical. Autism \"research\" has put back autism acceptance about 50 years", "And on this sub the phrase is \"My house, My rules\"", "But you told him cats would be allowed inside? Perhaps I don't understand the cable thing, can you explain what that means? And why do windows have to be opened and closed in that room? \n\nOverall I am going to go with ESH for judgment, because it seems like you could have told him to not enter the room or allow any animals, but you told him cats could go inside which could have caused just as big of an issue as a dog. Calling him out in front of coworkers was also not OK.  On his part, he did not listen to your instructions, and a dog did go into the room.\n\nUltimately if there are major clean area issues in your house, it is probably unwise to have coworkers bring animals over where accidents and smells can occur.", "We have the habit to turn off the internet cable before bed to save on money. We also leave all windows slightly open for a few hours of the day", "I'm guessing this is not in the U.S.? Is the internet cable/router in Faisol's room? Also, is the \"habit\" of leaving the windows open and/or turning off the cable a hard and fast rule, or could it be amended for a few days to prevent people/animals from entering the room of your son, who has issues with any change to his environment?", "We need to do it so we don't overheat the house because of the very hot temperatures here. The internet cable is in his room. We cannot stop doing it, else it might actually be dangerous", "Dangerous how?", "Excess of heat inside the house damages appliances. We really get very hot weather and it's usually practice to open windows during major heat hours", "NTA\n\nAnd I cannot believe the callousness of your sister.  Perhaps, she's jealous of the attention Faisol receives?

They're tied to my brain, and to how my autistic brain experiences the world.

As much as I love the increase in acceptance of different presentations, the decrease in emphasis of masking, wider acceptance of accommodations, etc, we are *nowhere* near being able to advocate for those things for every neurodivergent person. The sad reality is (imo anyway), things like masking are still necessary in some situations. I have ADHD and as much as I'd like to not be reliant on expensive medications and switching out coping mechanisms constantly in order to trick my brain into working \"right\", the fact of the matter is I would not be able to afford living or build a future for myself if I can't hold down a job due to my ADHD.\n\nI guess my point is, I do see the value of your point of view, but I think we still have a lot of work to do to make \"the neurotypical world\" a livable place regardless of the type or amount of work you are able to eke out during your lifespan. Once we have things like universal healthcare, universal basic income, guaranteed housing, etc is when I'd really feel like we can finally move forward with transitioning away from this disability stuff.

How are u meant to relax, sleep, etc. in your own personal space when it's setting u off.\n\nIt doesn't matter if he understands or not. He chose not to take the rule seriously.  There's a huge difference between the smell of a dog and a cat! Especially a wet dog but just in general. Seriously ,wtf was he doing with a wet dog inside someone else's home! Eww\n\nHe was told not to do something in ur home. He's upset ur boy resulting in injury even, and he was freaking asked not to under any circumstances. Keeping an animal out of 1 room is not a big ask. It's like he did it on purpose to see what would happen like he didn't believe it.\n\nOh man that's infuriating.  Definitely NTA \nHe's lucky he doesn't have a deep cleaning bill on his hands tbh. Stick to ur guns.", "NTA. You can't just bring your pets wherever you want. I love my cat and would love if I could bring him everywhere. But there are places where it's unhygienic, people are scared/allergic. What's with people trying to bring animals everywhere lately (e.g. that guy who brought a raccoon to a wedding)?", "NTA No one wants to smell wet dog. It's a very sickening smell and if your son reacts that negatively to it, it's understandable that you wouldn't want him to be possibly exposed to it again. Not to mention seeing your co worker might be a trigger for your son", "Do you live by a body of water?\n\nYou're still NTA no matter how you answer, i'm just measuring how much of an asshole your coworker is.\n\nI also gotta say as a person who has owned dogs their entire life, i would be pretty fucking upset if I walked into my own room after someone was housesitting and it smelled like wet dog.\n\nThat to me is beyond rude and seems specifically directed at your kid.", "NTA\nIf John can\u2019t take other people\u2019s requests serious he clearly lacks understanding and empathy. If you don\u2019t want a dog in your home that\u2019s your rule. Your son\u2019s autism and sensory processing of odors is a very clear and understandable explanation for why you can\u2019t accept a dog in the house. If someone has an allergy to cats they make exceptions too for which animals they allow in their house so John\u2019s argument is invalid and just shows that he puts himself first and lacks empathy for other people. I have 4 year old autistic twins and if people can\u2019t accept them the way they are and show at least some basic understanding for a difficult situation, I don\u2019t need them in my life. I\u2019d have reacted the same way as you did.", "Uh, I have a dog but if someone housesat for me and I came home to wet dog stank I would be furious. Especially, in an area they had no business being. NTA.", "NTA. He had zero reason to even open the door to your son\u2019s room", "Dude chose to ignore the rules you set out for \\*your own house\\*.

Why couldn\u2019t he just keep that door closed?!?", "Exactly. We have a strict no pet rule in the bedrooms for hygiene purposes. This is a rule a lot of people have. And even if it was not it should be \u201cyour house, your rules\u201d .. given these are rules that people are able to apply.", "Yeah, what's really blowing my mind is that he brought any animals with him at all to housesit. Who does that?! The audacity... and then to purposely bring the dog (and a smelly one at that!) into this boy's room KNOWING it's the one rule OP set around animals in the house... just plain rude. He sucks. He doesn't get to decide what your or your son's boundaries are, and I'm glad you're sticking to them!

Autism isn't a disease, it's a neurological development disorder, there we agree, but it most certainly is a disability and it's not because of society. My executive function fluctuates and I can barely feed myself when I'm very overwhelmed. Am I only overwhelmed because of society noises, lights and smells? Nope. The thing that gives me most meltdowns are my own emotions. I have meltdowns because I overfill my glass of water. I have meltdowns because when I'm a bit bloated the elastic on my knickers doesn't feel the same compared to when I'm not. Society doesn't always help, yes, but it isn't the reason why autism is a disability. Also, that would make it that it's more or less of a disability depending on where you live. I'm in Sweden, which is basically a safe haven for autistic people. I'm not less disabled because of it.", "Ok so the door would have to be open for a time each day which answers my first question but if you open the door for a bit it still doesn\u2019t mean you have to let the dog in. Block it off with a box or something! We do this to our front door when we have to leave doors open, no baby gate or special equipment needed but we place a box with some books in it (our old house had a dresser close by we just pulled across the entrance).

ONE! And he broke it. What more is there to talk about?", "NTA. I don't mind dogs, but I won't allow them in my house . I don't want my house full of dog smell and dog hair.\n\nFor him to bring his dog inside when you specifically told him not to is a violation of your home. You don't even need to give a reason. Your house, your rules.\n\nUnfortunately, a large number of dog owners have a colossal sense of entitlement when it comes to their dogs, thinking they should be welcome everywhere, and that if you don't love their dog as much as they do and make a huge fuss of it, then there's something wrong with you.", "NTA, I am not autistic and I like dogs, but if my room smells like wet dogs after I told very clearly no dogs in the house I would be pissed. John can pay for a professional cleaner and still be not welcome in my house.", "Your son has an understandably human right - neuro-divergent or otherwise - to have a single room on this Earth that he feels safe in and in control of. John selfishly decided he knew more about autism than his own father did, and deemed it must be ridiculous enough to dismiss.\n\nAnd your sister also needs to learn that your son IS coping- he has one room he can go to when he needs to get away from things that distress him. I'm sure she feels the exact same way about her room- it doesn't make a difference if her stress is work or relationship related, while for your son its smells and dogs. *Everyone* needs somewhere they can go when they can't be anywhere else.\n\nNTA.", "NTA It\u2019s your house you\u2019re allowed to decide what pets can go in and out of it, not everyone likes dogs and letting them go in the bed room too is ridiculous like wtf is wrong with John?

That should be all that matters.\n\nIt\u2018s not like it was a rule that made it impossible for him to stay there.

Labels are very useful and descriptive.", "Why did I have to scroll so far to find this? There is no reason for the dog *or* the owner to be in that room!\n\nI've lived with dogs all my life. A smart pooch could learn to open doors, I could accept the dog getting in there accidentally but for one thing. The smell.\n\nIn my experience with both short and long hair dogs, Wet Dog\u2122 is not a lingering scent. (It's also one I love since it reminds me of all the wonderful dogs I've known!) If a dog only spends a couple of minutes in a room, the smell will leave shortly after the dog. It only hangs around if it transfers to something else, like the carpet, or a rug. Doggo has to lay on something for at least half an hour for that to happen. To still be able to smell it more than a day later, pooch was in that room for a good while.", "I\u2019m not saying it wasn\u2019t a reasonable boundary or that it shouldn\u2019t be respected.

I\u2019m autistic, and when I was younger, my step father would force me to eat tomatoes because they\u2019re good for you and I shouldn\u2019t be picky. Guess what? I still hate tomatoes and haven\u2019t touched a single one since I moved out of my parents house. For us autistic people, sensory issues aren\u2019t as simple as just unpleasant changes, they\u2019re deeply uncomfortable experiences that we try to avoid. \nOh, and you should tell John to stick it.", "Where did the dog come from does OP own the dog or did John bring his own dog and have it roll around the house or something.", "NTA, but Faisol needs to learn how to deal with his surroundings, as unfortunately you won\u2019t be there forever.

You asked him to do one thing; he decided it was a silly rule.  It was not *his decision* to make!\n\nI had a large dog that had never had people food ever.  This was great, the dog didn't get sick, he didn't beg or whine, etc.  My very elderly grandmother came to visit in my new home. I told her she could do anything she wanted, including smoke inside the house, but NEVER give the dog people food.  YUP!  As soon as she left, the whining started.  This lovely, usually well-behaved dog was tall enough to easily reach the top of the dining table and take food.  One day I had a pizza delivered and I left it on the table while I went to get my kids from the back yard.  The dog took the pizza, ate the whole thing... and instead of pizza we had dog puke that night.  I loved my grandmother but this still frustrates the heck out of me.

For one they are objectifying, like people are some kind of machine that functions better or worse. Plus something like high functioning depression manages at the same time to belittle the suffering of the affecting and degrade the non high functioning as somehow lesser people. Of course these terms are scientifically outdated and there are no objective criteria for them.
