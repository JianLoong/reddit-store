My parking space is located directly at the corner end of the parking lot. Recently, a driver in a red SUV parked directly in front of my car. This has been going on at least 3 nights a week for the past 3 weeks.\n\nI finally confronted the driver of the red SUV. Let's call him Robert. \n\nI asked Robert to leave since he was blocking my space and making it increasingly difficult for me to leave the premises. Robert told me he couldn't find parking because of the snow and that he was tired. Robert also told me how he lived around the same apartment complex as me. Trying to be polite, I explained to Robert that they had also parked in front of me two nights ago after a heavy snowstorm subsided, which was problematic for the snow removal services. The snow removal services were incomplete due to Robert's car causing an obstruction. After all, the snow plow operator will usually form a snow bank at the end of the parking lot (which is right next to my car) and needs to clear middle of the parking lot. Since Robert left his car, the snow removal operator plowed a snow bank around my and Robert's car. Somehow, Robert was able to easily get around the snow bank. I on the other hand wasn't able to get around the snow bank since the snow got frozen. As such, I had to use a metal pickaxe to break the ice and shovel away the ice (my back hurts now). \n\nI explained the situation with the snow removal to Robert. I also highlighted to Robert how I pay for parking in the PRIVATE PARKING LOT like all other owners of the parked cars here and that Robert shouldn't just expect to use a parking lot for free (there's no unoccupied space and private means private). Robert dismissed my concerns and just said he can't find parking because of the snow and that he could advance his car slightly and leave me some space so I could leave (I wasn't leaving when I confronted Robert). However, I reasserted to Robert that I pay for my parking space and I shouldn't have to make any arrangements to leave my space with anyone. As such, I told Robert if he didn't leave I'd call towing services. Throwing a fit, Robert threw some expletives at my way and dared me to call towing. I said ok, no problem and left. \n\nNow I feel like I may have been slightly of an asshole when asserting my position (paid parking, etc.). However, I also feel like there was no reason for me to explain my circumstance. Common sense would dictate you don't block anyone period this applies whether it's for someone renting a paid parking space or free parking space. I also asked Robert to leave several times in our exchange.", "created_utc": 1702106448, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18e84d0/aita_for_threatening_to_have_this_car_towed/", "score": 319, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most ppl would just have it towed tight away. \nYou explained it was a private lot and he cannot park in it,  you did more then you needed to. \nnext time it happens have the vehicle towed.\n\nI would call the landlord/PM person. Explain that there is a vehicle parking in the lot, the vehicles owner doesn't live at the appt complex. And the vehicle has been blocking you in.

I used to work for a contractor who took lots of state jobs. There was a lot near a state road that was owned by a state group. When the job was starting, the company was given the go ahead to use the lot/spots as a laydown area for equipment.\n\nPeople started raging - they PAID for those spots! Seems an enterprising building owner was renting the public spots he didn't own to his tenants (and placed signage) for some serious money, and had for a long time. Much grief ensued!", ">As such, I told Robert if he didn't leave I'd call towing services.\n\nYou either back it up or he will always ignore you going forward.

Not my problem.", "My building's manager is usually unavailable- unless there's an emergency- whenever I call them about towing the car (Robert usually parks in front of me after midnight). The problem arises because only management can access the towing services' current phone line. The towing services number displayed on the parking lot signage is no longer valid (number no longer in service). As such, my only resort is to call my building's manager and have the car towed through them. \n\nAlso, I feared that Robert might do something to my car (flatten my tire, scratch my car, etc.) if I had his car towed since it would be pretty obvious that I called my building management to have his car towed. Robert also seems to be familiar with the process to get cars towed judging by his attitude. Almost as if Robert was calling my blush when he dared me to call towing services.
