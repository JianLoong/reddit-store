Counter his argument by asking him to pay you a \"cleaning fee\" for the extra work he wants you to do. I bet he will suddenly enjoy picking up after himself.", "NTA - your husband sounds like a piece of work. Labour should be divided by hours worked, not monetarily.", "NTA!!!\n\nIt baffles me time and time again how People enter a relationship and then \"forget\" how to take care of themselves. Is he asking you to tie his shoes too? Or is he still able to do that? How about cutting up his food, he still good on that? When he lived by himself he had to work, do the dishes, sweep, mop, vacuum, change his bed sheets, all by himself, no? Or did he pay someone to do that? Of that's the case he can pay them now as well to clean up after him if he makes so much more.\nDefinitely NTA!!", "NTA. I think it should be split by hours worked. So if you both do 40 hrs a week then it should be 50/50. Who's he to say his time is more valuable than yours? Comparing income gives off major superiority vibes.", "NTA. Household chores should be split according to free time not salary.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, this seems like a big red flag to me. I wouldn't be surprised if the husband has other AH behaviors.", "Nta but he sure is.", "I make a significant chunk more than my partner. This is likely to change some day. We both work 40 hour weeks, but she is salaried and occasionally works up to 50. My schedule is Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday at work with guaranteed three day weekends. I do the bulk of our laundry, cleaning, cooking, and the larger portion of our pet care. I have no complaints about this. Life is a partnership, and we each handle different things.\n\nYou NTA.\n\nI don't know how fresh your marriage is, but your husband will likely hold that money over your head forever.", "NTA. If you work the same amount of hours and use around the same amount of time to get to/from work it just makes sense that you split household chores evenly.", "NTA\n\nHe sounds like an absolute joy.  Housework is a balance and is never completely evenly split. People will gravitate towards some jobs but not others and will do more some weeks and less the others.  If you have a healthy shared approach to it then everything is usually fine but sounds like your husband has a very weird way of looking at things.", "NTA this seems really messed up. You aren\u2019t a slave. So many things factor into income and household experiences. Wives generally take on the majority of the emotional labor as well.", "NTA. is he saying that even though your labor is equal, his time is more valuable than yours outside of work? That's inconsiderate and mean.", "NTA I bring in more but don't expect my husband to do more housework. Admittedly, I do less than my half BUT we compromised and hired a maid service to come in once a week and do the big stuff then it's easy for us to split up the rest. Highly recommend, a maid service is cheaper than a divorce lawyer.\nAND I also recommend hiring a family run service. The big services charge the same but pay they're cleaners minimum wage. In a small cleaning company they're all working so your payment goes directly to the maid.", "Nta - people will never make the EXACT same amount. That's not a feasible way to divide household labor.", "NTA, making less money doesn\u2019t give you less time or make you a messier person. If your husband lives in the house the same amount as you he should help clean the same amount as you. If he doesn\u2019t want to do that he can use his income to higher someone.", "why is she puttin all her paycheck into a joint account?", "The amount of money you\u2019re making doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re both working full time. Division of household chores should be pretty close to equal.  NTA", "NTA. If you both work full time there is absolutely no reason for you to do more chores !\n\nIf one of you was working part time, that could be understandable that this person uses this free time to do more at home but since it is not the case, i don't understand his reasoning... \n\nIn my coutry law states that each spouse must contribute financially up to their respective capacity. If he earns more, he should pay more but you should not do more at home !", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My husband is disabled and does some occasional online gig work, so I definitely make more money than he does... Joint account... But I certainly don't expect him to do more work around the house even though I make more money... Not even counting the fact that he is at home mostly 24/7 due to his health. I make the money and do most of the housework while he does what his health allows him to do around the house (which isn't much, but I accepted that fact when I married him).\n\nI won't lie... There are days when house stuff just doesn't get done (I'm looking at you basket of clean laundry in need of being folded), but's just the way the cookie crumbles around here.\n\nHusband tries to have food ready for me when I get home, and either the sauna all nice and heated for me, or a nice steamy bubble bath waiting the moment I walk in the door. Sometimes he'll have my foot bath set up so I can soak my feet (I have a heated bubbler to help alleviate plantar fasciitis).", "NTA.\nDoes your husband live in this house? If so, he's not \"helping out\" he's simply being an adult doing adult things in his own house. If he uses a mug, he can wash it. If he needs clean clothes, he can do a load of laundry. When did it become a thing that grown ass men picking up after himself is \"he's helping out?\" who's he helping but himself?", "Yea... I make 2.5x my wife. I'm not delusional. I'm overpaid and she works harder than me. I don't bring salary into any conversations about housework. It's always about how our days went.", "Wait, if all your paychecks go to the joint account then his do too??? If not, hold back some for yourself. My husband and I share all accounts no matter who is making more at the time. Then do half the housework and no more. Simply refuse. He'll learn to be a real man who does his share or he'll prove to be an a-hole who will leave this freeing you up to find a real man.", "Exactly. Something doesn\u2019t make sense here", "This can be a valid approach to finances, but it takes a hell of a fair relationship and people actively working to make sure it stays fair. Even then, it\u2019s not the right approach for everyone.\n\nI do have fully joined finances with my partner, but we work hard on it and have spent 13 years fine tuning the process. I still have money he can\u2019t touch, and I\u2019m trying to persuade him to have money I can\u2019t touch lol.", "Yes, his paychecks all go in our joint account too, however he invests the majority of it in the stock market.", "Does he pay a fair share of the household expenses? I mean by percentage here, not 50/50. So if he makes twice what you do, he should cover 66% and you 33%.\n\nMy man should absolutely be helping around the house more or funding help around the house. But I am worried that he is taking financial advantage of you.", "And do you have access to those accounts?", "NTA. Besides all the other great comments I want to add that you need to start maintaining your own savings. \n\nOnly an agreed upon portion of your pay check should be going into the joint account (the rest should be only accessible to you). In the long term this will prevent a lot of heart break if this relationship does not go down well", "NTA His reasoning makes no sense at all. He is just being lazy and using this as an excuse to get out of helping.", "NTA - does he think that one of you somehow gets more hours in a day than the other - because it is TIME and effort you should be keeping equal not money - as that's the one thing that's absolutely the same for both of you and is 100% not recoverable.", "Do this.", "My ex was like OP\u2019s husband. Claimed she \u201cworked hard to provide for us\u201d so she was too tired to help out with anything when she got home. Meanwhile I\u2026.made more money than her. Paid for all the groceries. Did all the cooking and cleaning. Took care of the dogs and her daughter from her previous relationship. She worked 4 10 hour days and had Fridays off but she \u201cneeded it to relax.\u201d \n\nIt was wild. Adults should split chores based, like you said, on how much time they have and even then, the partner who works longer hours still needs to contribute."]}
