I wouldn't be providing info on why you said no tho, as people like this will use that against you. Or try to. You can just refer to your employment agreement and state you're not available to pick up that extra task... unless they'd like to renegotiate your contract, ofc.", "NTA - don't give reasons to your boss for refusing any type of work outside the scope of your duties that you don't want to do. Just refuse. \n\nYour boss' choice to increase your responsibilities and change the scope of your work doesn't need to become the new measure of how your feel about yourself or your job. \n\nWhen your boss says you're not a team player, they're really saying \"I don't like that I can't control you\"", "NTA. This has nothing to do with being a team player or not. You agreement was that you would be 100% remote until you relocate in 2023 (if I'm understanding correctly). Remind your boss of the agreement you have.", "I wouldn't put a child's 11th birthday over work (and I have an 11 year old, he would NOT care if his aunt/uncle was there, no matter how much the adult is convinced they are super close and the child would care- children prefer to have their friends). Unless you guys do \"family\" birthdays instead, which kids don't like (it's an excuse for the adults to get together and not what a kid would choose). \n\nThat said, if the contract says no travel until 2023, just say you can't, and try to renegotiate your contract to cover all your additional tasks that you are being asked to do for an increase in pay.", "NTA. However, you need to read the job description you agreed to and get a better understanding of what your roles and responsibilities are at this workplace. If they are making you do more than what you agreed upon, it may be time to find a workplace that better fits the work culture you desire.", "NTA. You have previous plans. Plus, this isn't part of your job description. They are taking advantage of you. If they need someone to do these small jobs, they should hire someone to do so, not decide to add things on to you; and I bet they didn't offer any compensation, did they?", "I\u2019m going to review my contract for leverage when I say no. Thank you!", "Ok, I\u2019m really scared about being firm since this is my first job and I need the income (paranoid about being fired) lol but i\u2019m going to do it anyways", "You\u2019re so right. I\u2019m going to stand firm.", "Yes, you are understanding correctly.", "He\u2019s not turning 11, his birthday is *on* the 11th. He\u2019s turning 3.", "I\u2019m going to review my job description after my work day, I\u2019m positive he never said anything about required travel.", "I get travel compensation for gas and milage and they pay for a hotel, but they don\u2019t cover all my food expenses", "The most important is that you set boundaries clearly with your boss, but always in a very nice/cooperative way don\u2019t go on your high horse, but try to have a real talk with him on what he\u2019s expecting you to do and negotiate/create boundaries from here.", "Don't be surprised if your job description says something like \"any other duties required for the running of the business\" all of my employers in the UK have always had such a clause so it's harder to argue that you weren't hired for certain duties.", "Yup. I've removed that from job descriptions in the past before agreeing to the job. Some places are okay with that, some are not. \n\nI hope OP can figure out a way forward. Sucks when bosses are dicks like this."]}
