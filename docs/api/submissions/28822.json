She currently is unemployed and shares her apartment with her unborn child\u2019s father. She does hair from time to time out of her home and occasionally I get her to do my hair.\n\n\nHere comes the problem, I asked her at 5 pm if she could do my hair, she said yes but I\u2019d have to come to her house because her back hurts and she doesn\u2019t feel like driving to me (we always do it at my house). I said no problem I\u2019ll call and get a ride to your house. Then she tells me I\u2019d have to sit on the floor at her home so she can sit on the couch & be comfortable without back pain. I have no problem doing this at my house but she has roaches. Not one or two, but armies of roaches. \n\n\nThey are everywhere, it\u2019s why I don\u2019t usually go visit at her house or we chill & hangout at my apartment. I told her no, I didn\u2019t want to sit on her floor due to all the bugs she had. She was upset at this & said she will come to my house but next time I want my hair done I have to come to her, & if she has to come to me she\u2019s going to charge me for gas. Mind you, she stays 5 mins away from me.\n\n She came to my house and started eating my food and didn\u2019t start on my hair till about 30 minutes later and then she gets a phone call and starts to gossip on the call, which slows her down in doing my hair. Then she tells me she\u2019s going to step outside to finish her conversation & when I objected, she turned her nose up at me and still went outside anyways for about 10 minutes, then came back inside and talking on the phone and doing my hair even slower. \n\nFinally, she got off the phone and she got an emergency call from our mom that she needs to go pick up her child and so I understood the situation and I agreed to even go with her to pick up my nephew. On the way to pick up my nephew she made remarks about how she wanted to go home & take a bath because she hadn\u2019t taken a bath all day, & I started to grow more annoyed because she was prolonging my hair. \n\nSo we picked up my nephew and took him to his destination, and she somehow found the time to get into an argument with our mom and asked me for my opinion on the matter & I told her that I agree with mom, and she got upset at me. So she drove us back to my house & I went upstairs and she never came upstairs behind me. I had to come back outside 45 minutes later (11 pm atp) and knock on her car window because she wont answer the call or my text messages & she wouldn\u2019t let down her window.\n\n She was in the car on the phone talking to someone else about me and my mom & how we disagree with her, so at that point I told her to give me my money because I had already paid her half of it earlier that day. She gave me my money & drove off, sending me a angry text message about how I\u2019m a bad sister & she\u2019s pregnant, mad, stressed, and I don\u2019t understand her pain. She also said I can keep my money I need it more than she does. I dont see how since I\u2019m the one that\u2019s employed.

Too funny.", "Yup all correct", "It\u2019s an apartment. They have exterminators.

OP knows and clearly despises her sister. So why is she using her for last minute hair appointments in the evening when the sister is juggling all these other responsibilities? If you hate her that much and think she\u2019s gross, don\u2019t use her. Go book a normal appointment. This last minute and badly timed hassle is really probably *not* worth the money to the sister and she doesn\u2019t owe OP her evening as kids/family demands are on her just because OP can\u2019t bother to get her hair done the way most the world does it\u2026. By making an appointment during working hours at a salon and driving yourself there like a normal adult. It will be better for everybody if you just approach this with more professionalism. You wouldn\u2019t expect your dentist to drop everything and do a long procedure just because you asked them at 5 pm", "Exactly. That's the only thing I care about here.", "OP is the one asking last minute favors from her.", "It wouldn\u2019t allow me to go into details without exceeding the word count but she drove for less than 10 mins. 7 at the most tbh. She drove us to my mom\u2019s house so mom can drive us to pick up her child because my sister didn\u2019t want to waste her gas driving. My mom drove for about 30 mins, waited for about 20 mins. Drove us back to my sisters car after she picked up my sisters child while we both were in the car, all the while my sis car was parked at my moms home.", "NTA, but i would look for another hairstylist. A highly pregnant woman with backpain, stress and family emergencies is maybe not the best option... even if its your sister.\n\nBut also her kids have to live in a cockroaches infested home and none of your family did anything about this so far? Thats kind of super shitty. Aren't you worried about these kids at all?", "NTA then. Your sister mostly gets a pass bc she\u2019s got a lot going on, but some of the delays were quite inconsiderate (I\u2019m looking at you, bath)", "In my country you can get pet/child safe exterminators that use plant based pyrethrins with no withholding period (time children and animals cannot be in contact with treated areas). I know as I am mega paranoid about such things and needed an exterminator myself. Worth checking out as hoards of insects are also terrible for kids.  Edit: obviously there are a stack of different products but she can check out the individual product safety data sheets (msds) to be sure. :)", "An undependable stylist, family or not, would drive many of us bonkers. But, I can relate to the idea that if you have to pay someone and your sister has no income, plus she's competent when she's actually working, so you choose to employ her. I get it/ I just am impatient with nonsense and my hair would most definitely suffer because uh un. I don't want my hair done badly enough to sit still for 6 hours or more while someone behaves unprofessionally. I'd rather shave my head. \ud83d\ude18", "\u201cI\u2019ve try anyways.\u201d Just sounds patronizing to me. As you keep stating ,you know what you\u2019re getting into with your sister if you use her, so that\u2019s on you if it turns out so. You never say anywhere that she asked to be your charity case.", "Wrong. I love my gross sister. Get it together Monica. Bad family members exist. I know that. Doesn\u2019t automatically make me despise her. I\u2019m not using her, she is a self proclaimed beautician, so I asked for an appointment lol last min is a STRONG STRETCH, there was never a set time to begin with. It\u2019s whenever she wants, period point blank. My sister wasn\u2019t busy at 5, unless you consider laying in bed watching MY Netflix as busy\ud83d\ude02", "Lol... the sister isn't the victim here. \n\n> doesn\u2019t owe OP her evening as kids/family demands are on her\n\nDid the part where she spent hours talking on the phone got lost on you? Also what family demands? It was their mom who drove to take sister's kid and drop him off somewhere else (not with mom) because sister didn't want to spend her gas on pivking up her kid. \n\n>the sister is juggling all these other responsibilities?\n\nLike talking on the phone? \n\nWhat post did you read?", "Again not last minute, there was no set time and she was free", "Yeah she has a bad habit of waiting till late in the afternoon to bath.

We still have no explanation for why you don\u2019t just hire somebody in the normal way.", "No that\u2019s the point. You need to just bite the bullet and drive to another town where you can engage somebody more professionally to provide hired services for you, so that your lifelong animosity with your sister is not this dramatic issue in the background. Dentists, therapists, hair stylists, gynecologists, auto repair. Just find somebody with decent reviews to do business with, book an appointment during normal during hours, and then you don\u2019t have to worry about all this family childcare/driving drama and sibling resentment judgement.

Only barber shops for men and a \u201cbeauty school\u201d for women and children that cater to a certain type of hair. Mine is excluded. Id have to drive hours to the nearby towns to find a licensed beautician who caters to my type of style and hair.", "Because then her sister would get nothing?", "Well, it sounds like you either need to deal with your sister or start going to someone else. If you use your sister, you could try to organize it for a time that you can fill in the time she\u2019s going to screw around by doing your own household tasks. Hell, you could offer her one rate for being done in X hours and a lower rate if it takes longer than that. You know how she is. Instead of fighting it, either accept it or go elsewhere.", "At the end of the post, her sister already said the moneys not worth it, keep your money, etc", "I'm sure that was just blather? She is unemployed? If she doesn't need the money why is she doing hair? Its not the easiest thing a 7 month pregnant woman can do with her time? Especially long sessions like braiding or full weaving or lots of popular styling that takes hours to finish?"]}
