I cherish the voicemail of my dad signing happy birthday and saying he loves me so much.\n\n Maybe she just wanted to reread it from time to time? \n\nI know the common advice on Reddit is \"dump your partner right away for being anything less than you can understand\" but maybe she just didn't handle her disappointment well. Maybe she was telling her friends hoping you'd send her a quick text, or because she doesn't know how to process her emotions. People grow, couples should grow together. Just talk it over with her and let her know it bothered you, and see where her head was at. \n\nP.s. talking to your friends isn't always out of disrespect, especially with Gen Z and Internet culture.

You still have to wish someone happy birthday on their actual birthday, ideally one of the first things you say to them that day- so not texting them about other things first. \n\nSo for most people, this means sending them a text to say happy birthday. \n\nBut if you said happy birthday to her in person that morning, what is the need for a text? I really don\u2019t see her point of view at all and I\u2019m trying.\n\nNTA", "NTA After everything that you did, you STILL managed to wish your girlfriend a happy birthday on the actual day verbally. \n\nHow invested are you in this relationship?\n\nMy husband is the kind of person who is never satisfied. I don\u2019t even hear his grumbling anymore. Sometimes I poke fun at him. He apologizes and makes good.\n\nI feel like your girlfriend could be the same. In which case, roll your eyes and get over it.\n\nOtherwise your girlfriend is looking for excuses to dump you. If she can\u2019t be happy and appreciative with all of the effort that you put in\u2026 it could be because she is unhappy with you.", "NTA at all. Text messages, birthday or otherwise, are usually sent when two people are not physically in each other's company and therefore greetings need to be conveyed via a different method. You wouldn't be sat next to her watching TV and then text her to ask if she wants popcorn when you are right next to her and can verbally ask her. You've gone to a great deal of effort to make her feel special on her special day and the days before and afterwards, and it reasonable to assume that your presence and presents are the ultimate happy birthday greeting for her. She seems to be caught up in our generational (I'm 32F) societal pressure whereby affections must be displayed electronically no matter what, and it really loses the personal and thoughtful elements of consideration.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with her to establish her expectations and your limits. It could be argued that it takes 10 seconds to send out a happy birthday text so it's nothing too major for you to have to do... but on the other hand, you feel unappreciated for the physical and financial efforts you have put in, and where will her expectations actually end?", "Nta, on my Mrs birthday I say happy birthday and then before she goes to sleep ill make sure to say it one time. She 36 and I don't really feel the need to text her as well as wish her a happy bday in person.", "NTA I would find that kind of action/ request exhausting, I hope he doesn't have to deal with it often. He sounds like a very considerate boyfriend.", "I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s inaccurately remembering what she said or if he was listening that hard at the dinner. If she really did say text, that\u2019s fine. But most of the wives I know, including mine, have an expectation that their husbands will say happy birthday in person and do birthday stuff but will write a nice **Facebook post** on their birthdays. While it is a message, it\u2019s completely unrelated to texting. The point is that the next year she can look back and that every year it will tell her what was posted the previous year. It\u2019s also a way to publicly display to everyone she knows that her husband remembered her birthday so she can express her gratitude for him and show off that she has a caring husband. Most of the wives around here have that expectation, at least where I live. (Also, we\u2019re 40yo).\n\nIs it possible OP\u2019s girlfriend actually wanted a social media post that wished her a happy birthday and not a text? That would make far more sense to me.\n\nEdit: I don\u2019t think some people quite understand what I mean. If you do and still disagree, I think some of you might just be from too young a generation to have an understanding of this yet. Here\u2019s my reply to one person here about why my wife does it specifically (I\u2019m sure there are people who do it for social media clout but my wife doesn\u2019t\u2026she doesn\u2019t care if I send her a private post that only she can see, just as long as she gets one\u2026it\u2019s more about reminders of nice memories that are well-organized, not the clout):\n\n>It\u2019s less about the showing off for my wife. She doesn\u2019t really care even if I make it private, she\u2019s told me (I insist on publicly displaying because I want to). She\u2019s more interested in how Facebook tells her every year on a particular date what happened on that date in previous years. That\u2019s the main utility of Facebook for her. On my kids\u2019 birthdays, she sees pictures of them growing up over time. On Anniversaries, she sees how far we\u2019ve come as a couple (and is reminded of that year we both forgot until after midnight). On birthdays, she gets to see the little sweet messages that I\u2019ve sent her over the years (but not on years where I sent her one late, even at 12:05am like that one time).\n\n>My wife loves to look back and see how far our family has come and how far we\u2019ve come as a couple, seeing how our love has grown over time, how we\u2019ve changed. You just can\u2019t do that if the message is late or doesn\u2019t happen that year.\n\n>It\u2019s especially important because my wife and her family had a falling out many years back. They pushed her out of their lives and she\u2019s an only child. Her parents were all she had left and on birthdays, that\u2019s especially hard. Being able to look back and see joyful things on her birthday through the years is incredibly important to her and always has been, but is even more so these last 5 or so years.\n\n>Granted, this all hinges on whether it was actually a text or a Facebook message OP\u2019s girlfriend wanted, so this whole explanation could be absolutely pointless.", "Yeah my general rule of thumb is I will text people if I\u2019m not seeing them at all on the day, or not seeing them until after 12ish. If I see them first thing in the morning they\u2019re not getting a text hahaha", "Smh people really get upset about not being acknowledged publicly. Had an ex like that.", "He told her Happy Birthday in person on the day, why on earth would he also need to say it by text? How many times are you supposed to say happy birthday to someone?", "Seriously why though? Op spent the previous day and the morning of the bday with her. Even in person wishing her a happy bday.

I am in your age group, and this seems to be the default expectation but in all honesty, it is still pretty exhausting. \n\nIt kinda reminds me of an article I once read stating that happy couples don't post that much on social media because they are too busy with being happy. \n\nIf showing how much effort he put into her birthday was so important for her, she could have made a picture of the present or a selfie at the restaurant and post it with the caption \"wonderful boyfriend can't wait to celebrate my birthday \u2764\ufe0f\" All in all, it would rub me the wrong way if my efforts are only validated by the outside world.", "Honestly, expecting a FB post to flaunt your awesome relationship and thoughtful husband is almost as unreasonable and childish as expecting a text when you were congratulated in person and got gifts, but you might have touched on something, that she would like a text she can revisit in the future.\n\nStill unreasonable and childish to be mad about it, and the complaint to her friends is a very AH thing to do, given all he's already done.\n\nP.S. which doesn't mean your comment needs downvoting.

It\u2019s a minor quick thing, and easily solved by you and your GF talking. Think of this as part of love language. Sometimes little simple gestures make a world of difference over big ones. What you are doing is very nice, but sometimes it really matters to hear those affirmations at the right time. Please remove your head from your sphincter and remember to use your words in addition to gestures and gifts. \n\nYour GF is an AH for airing this dirty laundry to her friends. What she should have done is talk to you and tell you how she feels.

I'm certain you would take that into consideration in the future.\n\nIt's tiring (been there)...\n\nSome people don't want partners who are nice to them in genuine ways.

On my kids\u2019 birthdays, she sees pictures of them growing up over time. On Anniversaries, she sees how far we\u2019ve come as a couple (and is reminded of that year we both forgot until after midnight). On birthdays, she gets to see the little sweet messages that I\u2019ve sent her over the years (but not on years where I sent her one late, even at 12:05am like that one time).\n\nMy wife loves to look back and see how far our family has come and how far we\u2019ve come as a couple, seeing how our love has grown over time, how we\u2019ve changed.

They pushed her out of their lives and she\u2019s an only child. Her parents were all she had left and on birthdays, that\u2019s especially hard. Being able to look back and see joyful things on her birthday through the years is incredibly important to her and always has been, but is even more so these last 5 or so years.\n\nGranted, this all hinges on whether it was actually a text or a Facebook message OP\u2019s girlfriend wanted, so this whole explanation could be absolutely pointless.", "I wasn\u2019t talking about my wife, but OP\u2019s girlfriend. I was saying most wives around here want that. My wife just wants me to post something and has told me before that it\u2019s fine if I do a private post only she can see. She uses it mostly for memory collection purposes for family and the events we have. My wife mainly does it because there was a falling out with her family and me and the kids are the only family she\u2019s had now for a long time. She\u2019s had Facebook right around the time she was able to take photos all the time and have easy access to a computer, so it has become a curated journal that documents and reminds her of her life events every year. \n\nAlso, while I know your comments weren\u2019t really directed at my wife because the clout isn\u2019t important to her, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s worth the vitriol in the tone of your message for those who like to display their family\u2019s events publicly\u2026is it bad to be proud of your family and husband? It\u2019s not bragging, just being able to express how proud you are in a way that just isn\u2019t for that person. \n\nBut, yes, if OP\u2019s girlfriend was upset merely about a text, I don\u2019t really understand that and I think she was an asshole.", "Happy couple here.
