I listen to them when I'm sad and hear their voice. I cherish the voicemail of my dad signing happy birthday and saying he loves me so much.\n\n Maybe she just wanted to reread it from time to time? \n\nI know the common advice on Reddit is \"dump your partner right away for being anything less than you can understand\" but maybe she just didn't handle her disappointment well. Maybe she was telling her friends hoping you'd send her a quick text, or because she doesn't know how to process her emotions. People grow, couples should grow together. Just talk it over with her and let her know it bothered you, and see where her head was at. \n\nP.s. talking to your friends isn't always out of disrespect, especially with Gen Z and Internet culture. People these days are simply desensitized to over sharing. It is possible she has no idea it's a problem for you.\n\nEdit: NTA  (forgot to put in post)", "NTA. Birthday texts and calls are for when you\u2019re not going to see the person to tell them to their face.", "NTA.  Is she stupid?  \ud83e\udd14", "NTA you took her out, gave her gifts, said happy birthday to her face that morning - that all sounds like a lovely time. More effort than my partner has put in some years, for sure.", "So you treated her to a special birthday dinner and a gift she wanted the night before, wished her Happy Birthday in person in the morning, texted throughout the day, and went out for drinks the night of her birthday. And instead of being grateful she talks bad about you to her friends about a petty birthday text wtaf!!", "I don\u2019t think the gifts and plans the day before or after or later that day are relevant. You still have to wish someone happy birthday on their actual birthday, ideally one of the first things you say to them that day- so not texting them about other things first. \n\nSo for most people, this means sending them a text to say happy birthday. \n\nBut if you said happy birthday to her in person that morning, what is the need for a text? I really don\u2019t see her point of view at all and I\u2019m trying.\n\nNTA", "NTA After everything that you did, you STILL managed to wish your girlfriend a happy birthday on the actual day verbally. \n\nHow invested are you in this relationship?\n\nMy husband is the kind of person who is never satisfied. I don\u2019t even hear his grumbling anymore. Sometimes I poke fun at him. He apologizes and makes good.\n\nI feel like your girlfriend could be the same. In which case, roll your eyes and get over it.\n\nOtherwise your girlfriend is looking for excuses to dump you. If she can\u2019t be happy and appreciative with all of the effort that you put in\u2026 it could be because she is unhappy with you.", "NTA at all. Text messages, birthday or otherwise, are usually sent when two people are not physically in each other's company and therefore greetings need to be conveyed via a different method. You wouldn't be sat next to her watching TV and then text her to ask if she wants popcorn when you are right next to her and can verbally ask her. You've gone to a great deal of effort to make her feel special on her special day and the days before and afterwards, and it reasonable to assume that your presence and presents are the ultimate happy birthday greeting for her. She seems to be caught up in our generational (I'm 32F) societal pressure whereby affections must be displayed electronically no matter what, and it really loses the personal and thoughtful elements of consideration.\n\nIt might be worth having a conversation with her to establish her expectations and your limits. It could be argued that it takes 10 seconds to send out a happy birthday text so it's nothing too major for you to have to do... but on the other hand, you feel unappreciated for the physical and financial efforts you have put in, and where will her expectations actually end?", "Nta, on my Mrs birthday I say happy birthday and then before she goes to sleep ill make sure to say it one time. She 36 and I don't really feel the need to text her as well as wish her a happy bday in person.", "NTA I would find that kind of action/ request exhausting, I hope he doesn't have to deal with it often. He sounds like a very considerate boyfriend.", "I\u2019m wondering if he\u2019s inaccurately remembering what she said or if he was listening that hard at the dinner. If she really did say text, that\u2019s fine. But most of the wives I know, including mine, have an expectation that their husbands will say happy birthday in person and do birthday stuff but will write a nice **Facebook post** on their birthdays. While it is a message, it\u2019s completely unrelated to texting. The point is that the next year she can look back and that every year it will tell her what was posted the previous year. It\u2019s also a way to publicly display to everyone she knows that her husband remembered her birthday so she can express her gratitude for him and show off that she has a caring husband. Most of the wives around here have that expectation, at least where I live. (Also, we\u2019re 40yo).\n\nIs it possible OP\u2019s girlfriend actually wanted a social media post that wished her a happy birthday and not a text? That would make far more sense to me.", "Yeah my general rule of thumb is I will text people if I\u2019m not seeing them at all on the day, or not seeing them until after 12ish. If I see them first thing in the morning they\u2019re not getting a text hahaha", "Smh people really get upset about not being acknowledged publicly. Had an ex like that.", "He told her Happy Birthday in person on the day, why on earth would he also need to say it by text? How many times are you supposed to say happy birthday to someone?", "Seriously why though? Op spent the previous day and the morning of the bday with her. Even in person wishing her a happy bday. Who and why would you again say happy bday via text hours after you've already said happy bday in person?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I am in your age group, and this seems to be the default expectation but in all honesty, it is still pretty exhausting. \n\nIt kinda reminds me of an article I once read stating that happy couples don't post that much on social media because they are too busy with being happy. \n\nIf showing how much effort he put into her birthday was so important for her, she could have made a picture of the present or a selfie at the restaurant and post it with the caption \"wonderful boyfriend can't wait to celebrate my birthday \u2764\ufe0f\" All in all, it would rub me the wrong way if my efforts are only validated by the outside world.", "Honestly, expecting a FB post to flaunt your awesome relationship and thoughtful husband is almost as unreasonable and childish as expecting a text when you were congratulated in person and got gifts, but you might have touched on something, that she would like a text she can revisit in the future.\n\nStill unreasonable and childish to be mad about it, and the complaint to her friends is a very AH thing to do, given all he's already done.", "> And kept going on about it\n\nI\u2019m sure OP remembered just fine. How did you not hurt yourself doing all those mental gymnastics at your big age? Just because your wife demands you post about her on social media to flaunt how \u201chappy\u201d you are together, doesn\u2019t mean that all women want this.", "This expectation sounds really childish...", "How exhausting. Why do people need to convince others on socials that they have perfect, romantic relationships? Makes me wonder whether the relationships suck irl or whether the people are so insecure that they are preoccupied with their personal socials branding.", "Thank you lmao"]}
