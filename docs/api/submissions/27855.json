Not a lot, just a little spilled. He got mad and said to me \u201ccan she not eat by herself?\u201d And I told him \u201cnot cereal on the couch\u201d. For a little context, she does eat cereal on the couch sometimes, but only if someone\u2019s sitting with her and helping her. Otherwise she eats it at the table just fine. Anyway, he got even more mad at me and started yelling about \u201cwell I\u2019ve seen her eat just fine! Why are you making me feel like an idiot?\u201dand I just grabbed my daughter and moved her to the table and continued cleaning. I didn\u2019t say anything after that, which made him even more mad. But we moved on with the day. \n\nLater, we were getting ready to go to a corn maze with my nieces. My dad, daughter and I stopped at a convenience store for drinks. I grabbed five COLD drinks for everyone and some baby wipes for my daughters sticky hands. My dad grabbed the baby wipes and was trying, and struggling, to open them in the store to clean her. I said \u201cmy hands are really cold, can we just go pay and I\u2019ll clean her hands in the car\u201d and he got PISSED. He stood there yelling at me about treating him like a five year old, he can\u2019t do anything right, and he\u2019s just sick of being treated like that. He then told me \u201cwhen we walk out of here, I\u2019m going home. I don\u2019t care what you do, but I\u2019m going home\u201d keep in mind, home is a 6-7 hour car ride away. So I told him \u201cok, give me my kid and I\u2019ll call my sister\u201d set all the drinks down, grabbed my daughter and started to walk away. He asked me not to, we payed and got in the car. Then he said in the car \u201cyou can\u2019t take her away from me. If you want to not talk to me, not see me, that\u2019s one thing. But don\u2019t take her away from me\u201d.\nMy dad has always been over sensitive and over reactive to everything.

My father is like this, the littlest things set him off and he always refuses to take responsibility for it.

Blowing up like this is not normal. He has obviously done it your entire life and you just accept it as normal, and move around it, never questioning or holding him to account. That means you barely recognise it as abusive behaviour. But that\u2019s what it is. Now he is doing it to your child. So you have a choice-  either allow him to verbally abuse and intimidate your child like he did to you or don\u2019t. The lightest push back from you resulted in his pathetic pleading to allow him to see his grandchild. He knows what he is doing is wrong and he knows you can cut off access (entirely justified tbh) and it frightens him. He either addresses his issues or he doesn\u2019t get access. If it was me I\u2019d go very LC until he demonstrates that he is serious about learning a new way to deal with his emotions.", "NTA. Your father sounds exhausting. More needy and whiney than a toddler. I would be putting him in time out until he learns how to behave like a adult.", "NTA - HE is being a spoiled baby and lashing out.  IT's not good for you or your child to be around him until he learns to control his temper.", "NTA. But your father needs to be evaluated; he sounds mentally unstable.", "NTA, and your father is the tiresome toddler here.

Anger is often the reaction when a person loses the ability to do things and becomes forgetful (when they feel they should know), especially when someone they used to help steps in to do it for them.

You haven't gone overboard enough to stop his childish behavior.", "YTA\n\nDon't know what your dynamics are with your dad, but from your description of the interactions you have given, you seem to treat your dad with no respect. You seem to expect him to read your mind and just \"know\" what you know. Maybe he forgot some of the little things about how toddlers work. \n\nBut wow! You have a dad who loves your little one and wants to do the little things with her. He reminds me of my dad (he passed years ago, we all still miss him like crazy), always trying to help. Me always going behind him, picking up the little things and making what he did fit with my expectations. His interaction with my children was the most important thing for them.\n\nTry reading some of the stories where the parents would give a lot just to have parents who want to be grandparents.", "NTA and that is extremely concerning behavior on his part. None of that is ok.", "NTA. I think some parents act like this when their kids are younger because they know the kids can't/won't say/do anything about it. So when the kids get to be adults and basically don't have the time or patience to put up with it they don't like it and throw an even bigger tantrum.", "NTA but let's pull out the camera here for a second. \n\nWhat's going on with your pops? I think some of this feels like basic cry for help behavior. \n\nYou might want to respond to him with some cool kindness and get him to open up a bit. There might be a lot going on behind the scenes that, will not excuse his behavior, but can certainly explain it. \n\nAfter you work through that with most folks you usually get an apology and can move forward with a deeper understanding. That's been my experience at least. \n\nPeople on this sub tend to treat all problems as something to juice yourself up as the good person and then run away from. \n\nI've scanned through like ten posts just now with a dozen or so suggestions to cut contact. With family, friends, etc. \n\nIf you want a robust line of communication and closeness you have to foster it. People will mess up. They go through stuff. Dissection after the fact to see who was in the right is only a small part of understanding and reconciliation. \n\nNot saying there are times to set boundaries or cut people off but, if I were in your shoes, I'd wanna know what's up with my dad.", "NTA. Your father has a hair trigger temper. He needs professional help. I highly suggest you insist he gets it if he wants a relationship with your child.

I'm the parent and you're not.\"", "Why is your dad so grumpy? Meds? Medical reason? Is there something going on and you just need to sit and talk to him and see where he is headwise?

I mean unless you dad is an asshole for no reason talk to him.", "Yeah, OP, don't subject your child to your dad's toxic behavior just because you've been raised to normalize it. I would insist that he goes to therapy and that you see sustained change until you let him around your daughter again. \n\nI'm in my 40s and in therapy because I still get triggered by yelling and stuff since I was raised around people like your dad. It's abusive behavior in my opinion.", "There is a MASSIVE difference between 'forgetting some of the little things' and blowing up at your daughter *in public*, and for the second time in a single day in front of your grandchild. The fact that plenty of people wish their parents wanted to be grandparents has no bearing on the fact that *this* grandfather's behavior is concerning and unacceptable. The priority here shouldn't be his feelings (which isn't to say that they don't matter at all), but the protection of a little girl who shouldn't have to experience his inappropriate and potentially quite frightening outbursts. OP would be TA if she *didn't* separate her child from her father until he takes real steps to express his love in a safe, healthy manner.", "Oops my fault for not reading your whole comment. Sorry dude \ud83d\ude14", "Yeah sure, but it's also a symptom in dozens of other things including dementia, autism, depression, PTSD, alcoholism, anxiety, stress...so maybe let's not diagnose him over the internet when we're missing most of the clinical context."]}
