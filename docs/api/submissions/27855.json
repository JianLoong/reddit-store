This morning, I was cleaning my sisters (35F) house for her while she was at work. My dad gave my daughter a bowl of cereal on the couch, which she spilled almost instantly. Not a lot, just a little spilled. He got mad and said to me \u201ccan she not eat by herself?\u201d And I told him \u201cnot cereal on the couch\u201d. For a little context, she does eat cereal on the couch sometimes, but only if someone\u2019s sitting with her and helping her. Otherwise she eats it at the table just fine. Anyway, he got even more mad at me and started yelling about \u201cwell I\u2019ve seen her eat just fine! Why are you making me feel like an idiot?\u201dand I just grabbed my daughter and moved her to the table and continued cleaning. I didn\u2019t say anything after that, which made him even more mad. But we moved on with the day. \n\nLater, we were getting ready to go to a corn maze with my nieces. My dad, daughter and I stopped at a convenience store for drinks. I grabbed five COLD drinks for everyone and some baby wipes for my daughters sticky hands. My dad grabbed the baby wipes and was trying, and struggling, to open them in the store to clean her. I said \u201cmy hands are really cold, can we just go pay and I\u2019ll clean her hands in the car\u201d and he got PISSED. He stood there yelling at me about treating him like a five year old, he can\u2019t do anything right, and he\u2019s just sick of being treated like that. He then told me \u201cwhen we walk out of here, I\u2019m going home. I don\u2019t care what you do, but I\u2019m going home\u201d keep in mind, home is a 6-7 hour car ride away. So I told him \u201cok, give me my kid and I\u2019ll call my sister\u201d set all the drinks down, grabbed my daughter and started to walk away. He asked me not to, we payed and got in the car. Then he said in the car \u201cyou can\u2019t take her away from me. If you want to not talk to me, not see me, that\u2019s one thing. But don\u2019t take her away from me\u201d.\nMy dad has always been over sensitive and over reactive to everything.
