Is it just a preference for her family or is it that the normal place has a reason it can't be there? Can you not sleep at all if people are in the house or will you just possibly not sleep as well? Or will you totally miss your Thanksgiving plans or just be a few minutes late if you sleep somewhere else? All of these answers factor into A H status.", "NTA as sleep is needed. But maybe consider talk with the room mate and see if family could start arriving when you are awake as a compromise? That way they can have their family over and you can sleep in your own bed?
