I\u2019ll call them Jane (19F) Liam (17M) and Sarah (11F). Sarah has become increasingly difficult to deal with and be around. She is losing friends, becoming argumentative and just being incredibly judgemental and rude. \n\nMy mum (52F) is a single mum so Jane and I are expected to take Sarah to school, activities, play dates etc. which I haven\u2019t really had a problem with unless I had something on, by which Jane or Liam would do it, but regardless, I feel like I am her primary carer. \n\nTwo days ago while driving Sarah to her ballet class, she told me she\u2019s becoming increasingly frustrated with her friends at school because they don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore. I asked her why they don\u2019t and she said that they are being over dramatic about a comment she made about her friend being \u201cugly and overweight.\u201d She genuinely could not understand why her friend was insulted, even though I tried to explain to her by putting her in her friends shoes.\nI told my mum about it that evening and suggested that what she does online and what she is texting should be monitored (as that is where the comments were made) and she said no  agreed with Sarah that her friends are just being dramatic. \nI snapped at my mum for how lenient she is on Sarah and how I would never have been given the same leniency. She told me \u201cshut up,\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t tell me how to raise my child.\u201d\n\nHere is where I might be the AH. I yelled at her that I am more involved in Sarah\u2019s upbringing significantly more than she is and that she is creating a false sense of \u201cdo no wrong\u201d in her, and that her \u201cyoungest child syndrome\u201d is incredibly loud. I also pointed out that she is 11, and therefore has no sense of online security and I screamed \u201cdon\u2019t come crying to me if she gets lured by a predator.\u201d while I admit I escalated the situation, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s completely unnecessary to say.\n\nmy family is pretty split about who is the AH here.", "created_utc": 1700405206, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17yyqfl/aita_for_snapping_at_my_mum_for_how_shes_raising/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Remember Cyber bullying leaves permanent scars  \nWith no online parental control she is open to online predators.  \n\n\nI am 4 0f 6, my little brother got away with blue murder where the rest of us would have been punished, some times quite severely.\n\nLast child syndrome", "NTA\n\nI would stop doing any kind of caring/parenting for Sarah, after all, you wouldn't want to tell (show) your mother \"how to raise her child\", right? Time for your mother to get more involved in raising her own kid.\n\nYou were not wrong to be worried about Sarah's behaviour or for your concerns for her online safety. Predators be predating and they of course use the internet for that. I bet almost every child or young person who is active online will at some point have interacted with a predator. The kids who get abused are, I think, often kids who have little parental involvement. I don't think an 11 year old should have any privacy in what they do on their devices.", "NTA. People can have their lives ruined by bullying online. She is 11 and doesn\u2019t understand that these moments don\u2019t ever go away. It is your mom\u2019s job to create functional, well adjusted adults out of her children. If your sister doesn\u2019t see the problem with insulting someone and then gaslighting them, your mom is failing\u2026 miserably. \n\nMaybe you needed to be harsh to snap your mom out of this stupor. No 11 year old should be on the World Wide Web, unchecked. It\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible. I hope your sister gets the help she needs!", "NTA if you are doing a significant amount of the work, you definitely get a say.", "NTA, you noticed a huge problem with your sister and your mother is dismissing your concerns. Allowing your sister this type of \u201cfreedom\u201d is not doing her any favors. Sarah will be the one to suffer in the long term unless your mother gets back in the game and starts parenting her child.", "NTA your sister is going to continue alienating her friends to the point where she is alone. And your mom reinforcing her behavior is just going to make her think everyone else is the problem. She\u2019ll never take accountability for herself.", "NTA even if you probably could have managed the situation better. You are only 20, worrying about your 11yo sister so you do the best you can.\nI hope you mother start to understand the danger for your sister.", "NTA. It's important to address these issues early on and it seems like you genuinely care about your sister's well-being. Open communication and monitoring her online activities can help guide her towards better behavior. Your concerns are valid and it's important for your mother to listen to them.", "NTA and there is really a trend on here at the moment of posts where children have have experienced parentrification. Your mom should be the one dealing with this and the consequences, not you. I am sorry to say but it\u2019s pretty obvious where your sister is getting her attitude from and I hope you haven\u2019t been on the receiving end OP", "NTA it\u2019s time for you to move out. Live your life and stop worrying about how your sister behaves or will turn out.", "NTA. I'm assuming your sister is going through a \"brutally honest\" phase. Or what's hopefully just a phase, and not a behaviour that will last till well into adulthood. While I think you are right, I don't think yelling at your Mom will get the results you are wanting, despite this largely being your Mom's fault. \n\nWhile for me it was a bit different when I was young, I had to come to the conclusion that being brutal didn't actually mean honesty. It was just brutal. Just because you could say and think it, doesn't mean it's true. While I have no advice on what method of teaching your sister this, I agree that someone needs to teach her that being a bully isn't cute. It doesn't make anyone more quirky, different from the other girls, or better. They are just an AH full stop. Hopefully, your sister will learn this before she burns all her bridges. However if she truly doesnt understand why calling someone \"ugly and overweight is bad\", there might be other huge issues here.", "NTA!\n\nAs an fellow oldest sister of 4, including a currently somewhat unbearable 11 year old girl, I can really see where you're coming from. There is constant high tension in my house between my mum and my sister due to her kind of manipulative and ignorant tendencies - although this is more just within my family, not so much at school. I love her but am really hoping she grows out of this soon and it's literally tearing my family apart. You had all the right to bring that up with your mum and I'm so sorry she replied like that. I can see how 11 year old girls in today's society seem kind of uncontrollable (which isn't incorrect), but this problem is just going to escalate if she fails to recognise the issues with your sister's behaviour. I guess that she is probably crazily busy and doesn't have the time to intensely monitor your sisters internet usage, but you could try suggesting things like screen time limits and changing wifi settings to censor certain stuff. Your and my sister both seem like they need to be put in someone less fortunate than themselves shoes for a week so they can see the world from a perspective other than their own for once. I hope that you're ok during all of this and that this situation gets better soon <3", "NTA, the truth hurts", "NTA... a bit. You are doing her job, she's the Mum, not you. But she is doing 2 jobs, and that's tough too. Economics is hard on so many families, so maybe cut Mum a bit of slack for not being there all the time, as at least there is food, housing and clothes. However, I think a one off blow up is ok, lets off a bit of steam and does bring out some valid points. In my family this does happen, and there is a black cloud for a while, then we hug it out. The urgent issue is your sister's behaviour, and maybe you could be a big sister here, not a Mum. Talk to little sis, tell her that while Mum lets her do stuff, her friends are pretty well telling her that she should stop. If she wants to keep her friends she needs to be nice. Hopefully she'll take some notice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

You\u2019ve done more than you needed to to help raise and care for Sarah and because of that you are entitled to your actions.  \n\nI would go far far away for a little while, maybe forever.  I\u2019m sorry you have such a tough family to deal with.", "\"Don't tell me how to raise my child\" In that case let her ACTUALLY raise her. You are of age to move out, as is your sister, and your brother is almost of age, so I would do exactly that, with haste, and let her deal with it. NTA", "Looks like both your mom and Sarah are bullies. NTA", "Your mother is the asshole for failing to parent her child and leaving the job to her other kids.\n\nEverything you say is valid. All children need monitoring on the internet. As sadly the news shows us all too often. \n\nIs your sister's attitude poor parenting or could there be something else going on with her inability to put herself in others' shoes? Is she on the spectrum?\n\nNTA your mother needs to step up.", "NTA. Mom & sis think you\u2019re on their backs when you\u2019re the only one having their backs", "NTA. You have a mature head on your shoulders, and while you shouldn\u2019t have to take on so much responsibility you obviously care a great deal about your sister. I think it\u2019s very natural to get frustrated and want to lash out. Your mum has become complacent and is simultaneously leaning heavily on you to monitor and guide your sister while not wanting to hear your criticisms of her parenting - well she can\u2019t have it both ways. You both deserve a mother who cares about who you turn out to be as adults. Your sister needs guidance and your mum needs to provide it or at the absolute bare minimum support you better", "NTA - you\u2019re practically Sarah\u2019s primary care giver, I\u2019d say you should have a say in this matter. Bullying can go a long way, and that\u2019s something that could easily follow her for years to come. Her mother needs to step up as a parent and properly educate her on the matter.", "While usually i\u2019d agree with stop helping out with my sister, my mum works 2 jobs to support us so unfortunately it\u2019s not that simple. Where I\u2019m from we don\u2019t move out to go to college so she is literally keeping me housed.

That's some strong \"the advice on Reddit all comes from 17 year olds\" nonsense. \n\nYour sister needs a mother, and she doesn't have one. Eleven is right about the age I'd expect that to start causing problems. If you can, lean *in* on the parenting. Explain to her that your mother can't be there even though she'd like to because you all need the money from her jobs. Tell her you're there if she needs advice. Tell her that regardless of whether she understands why, the consequence of mean comments is that you lose your friends - as she's seeing! \n\nIt's not right, it's not fair, and you shouldn't have to do this, but it's the best thing you can do for your sister in the circumstances you've got.", "No you cannot just opt out, it would not be fair on your sister. Have a word with your siblings and get them to help out your sister by at least talking to her and monitoring her as much as possible, maybe also speak to a trusted teacher or someone else? I would also speak to your mother again quietly and calmly and explain just how vurnabl your sister is, how she is in so much danger as well. If she does not listen and no one else will help then I think you have to consider contacting CPS.", "Thank you I really appreciate that. I\u2019m not at a capacity to be a parent more than I am though because I study and work full time.", "I get that. Poor kid. (Also poor you!)"]}
