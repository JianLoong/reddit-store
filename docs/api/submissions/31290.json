Time for your mother to get more involved in raising her own kid.\n\nYou were not wrong to be worried about Sarah's behaviour or for your concerns for her online safety. Predators be predating and they of course use the internet for that. I bet almost every child or young person who is active online will at some point have interacted with a predator. The kids who get abused are, I think, often kids who have little parental involvement. I don't think an 11 year old should have any privacy in what they do on their devices.", "NTA. People can have their lives ruined by bullying online. She is 11 and doesn\u2019t understand that these moments don\u2019t ever go away. It is your mom\u2019s job to create functional, well adjusted adults out of her children. If your sister doesn\u2019t see the problem with insulting someone and then gaslighting them, your mom is failing\u2026 miserably. \n\nMaybe you needed to be harsh to snap your mom out of this stupor. No 11 year old should be on the World Wide Web, unchecked. It\u2019s dangerous and irresponsible. I hope your sister gets the help she needs!", "NTA if you are doing a significant amount of the work, you definitely get a say.", "NTA, you noticed a huge problem with your sister and your mother is dismissing your concerns. Allowing your sister this type of \u201cfreedom\u201d is not doing her any favors. Sarah will be the one to suffer in the long term unless your mother gets back in the game and starts parenting her child.", "NTA your sister is going to continue alienating her friends to the point where she is alone. And your mom reinforcing her behavior is just going to make her think everyone else is the problem. She\u2019ll never take accountability for herself.", "NTA even if you probably could have managed the situation better. You are only 20, worrying about your 11yo sister so you do the best you can.\nI hope you mother start to understand the danger for your sister.", "NTA. It's important to address these issues early on and it seems like you genuinely care about your sister's well-being. Open communication and monitoring her online activities can help guide her towards better behavior. Your concerns are valid and it's important for your mother to listen to them.", "NTA and there is really a trend on here at the moment of posts where children have have experienced parentrification. Your mom should be the one dealing with this and the consequences, not you. I am sorry to say but it\u2019s pretty obvious where your sister is getting her attitude from and I hope you haven\u2019t been on the receiving end OP", "NTA it\u2019s time for you to move out. Live your life and stop worrying about how your sister behaves or will turn out.", "NTA. I'm assuming your sister is going through a \"brutally honest\" phase. Or what's hopefully just a phase, and not a behaviour that will last till well into adulthood. While I think you are right, I don't think yelling at your Mom will get the results you are wanting, despite this largely being your Mom's fault. \n\nWhile for me it was a bit different when I was young, I had to come to the conclusion that being brutal didn't actually mean honesty. It was just brutal. Just because you could say and think it, doesn't mean it's true. While I have no advice on what method of teaching your sister this, I agree that someone needs to teach her that being a bully isn't cute. It doesn't make anyone more quirky, different from the other girls, or better. They are just an AH full stop. Hopefully, your sister will learn this before she burns all her bridges. However if she truly doesnt understand why calling someone \"ugly and overweight is bad\", there might be other huge issues here.", "NTA!\n\nAs an fellow oldest sister of 4, including a currently somewhat unbearable 11 year old girl, I can really see where you're coming from. There is constant high tension in my house between my mum and my sister due to her kind of manipulative and ignorant tendencies - although this is more just within my family, not so much at school. I love her but am really hoping she grows out of this soon and it's literally tearing my family apart. You had all the right to bring that up with your mum and I'm so sorry she replied like that. I can see how 11 year old girls in today's society seem kind of uncontrollable (which isn't incorrect), but this problem is just going to escalate if she fails to recognise the issues with your sister's behaviour. I guess that she is probably crazily busy and doesn't have the time to intensely monitor your sisters internet usage, but you could try suggesting things like screen time limits and changing wifi settings to censor certain stuff. Your and my sister both seem like they need to be put in someone less fortunate than themselves shoes for a week so they can see the world from a perspective other than their own for once. I hope that you're ok during all of this and that this situation gets better soon <3", "NTA, the truth hurts", "NTA... a bit. You are doing her job, she's the Mum, not you. But she is doing 2 jobs, and that's tough too. Economics is hard on so many families, so maybe cut Mum a bit of slack for not being there all the time, as at least there is food, housing and clothes. However, I think a one off blow up is ok, lets off a bit of steam and does bring out some valid points. In my family this does happen, and there is a black cloud for a while, then we hug it out. The urgent issue is your sister's behaviour, and maybe you could be a big sister here, not a Mum. Talk to little sis, tell her that while Mum lets her do stuff, her friends are pretty well telling her that she should stop. If she wants to keep her friends she needs to be nice. Hopefully she'll take some notice.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

All children need monitoring on the internet.

You have a mature head on your shoulders, and while you shouldn\u2019t have to take on so much responsibility you obviously care a great deal about your sister. I think it\u2019s very natural to get frustrated and want to lash out. Your mum has become complacent and is simultaneously leaning heavily on you to monitor and guide your sister while not wanting to hear your criticisms of her parenting - well she can\u2019t have it both ways. You both deserve a mother who cares about who you turn out to be as adults. Your sister needs guidance and your mum needs to provide it or at the absolute bare minimum support you better", "NTA - you\u2019re practically Sarah\u2019s primary care giver, I\u2019d say you should have a say in this matter. Bullying can go a long way, and that\u2019s something that could easily follow her for years to come.

Where I\u2019m from we don\u2019t move out to go to college so she is literally keeping me housed.

That's some strong \"the advice on Reddit all comes from 17 year olds\" nonsense. \n\nYour sister needs a mother, and she doesn't have one. Eleven is right about the age I'd expect that to start causing problems. If you can, lean *in* on the parenting. Explain to her that your mother can't be there even though she'd like to because you all need the money from her jobs. Tell her you're there if she needs advice. Tell her that regardless of whether she understands why, the consequence of mean comments is that you lose your friends - as she's seeing! \n\nIt's not right, it's not fair, and you shouldn't have to do this, but it's the best thing you can do for your sister in the circumstances you've got.", "No you cannot just opt out, it would not be fair on your sister. Have a word with your siblings and get them to help out your sister by at least talking to her and monitoring her as much as possible, maybe also speak to a trusted teacher or someone else? I would also speak to your mother again quietly and calmly and explain just how vurnabl your sister is, how she is in so much danger as well. If she does not listen and no one else will help then I think you have to consider contacting CPS.", "Thank you I really appreciate that. I\u2019m not at a capacity to be a parent more than I am though because I study and work full time.", "I get that. Poor kid. (Also poor you!)", "Just straight direct tell her she is being rude and verbally abusive to her friends and that is why they don't want to friend her. And tell her they do it to protect themselves. Don't explain all that much. Just straight up tell it. That was my experience with teenagers - explaining is pointless.\n\nThis has zero to do with online or predators. Like, nothing at all. Kids insult other kid wherever they meet - online or offline. Before everyone had phone, kids would visit each other and would insult each other in their rooms. And the older they get, the less control adults even can have.", "NTA if OP is providing most of the care for the 11yr old why is she paying rent to mom?

I would say something that was factually true (Like telling someone their clothes don't fit and they need a bigger size) but could have been worded kinder or not said at all. I have trouble with empathy, so putting myself in someone else's shoes was something I had to learn in therapy.", "NTA but yelling at your mom isn't going to steer your sister in the right direction. \n\nIf you're already spending so much time with her, start trying to talk to her more and teach her the importance of empathy and cooperation. \n\nYou demanding that your mom do a better job parenting is going tonhave about as much effect as your sister telling her friends they are overdramatic.", "NTA. The mom needs to do something before Sarah becomes a total outcast. As someone who was known for having no filter in school even I knew not to insult my friends like that, and if I did I made sure to apologize and stop said comments/behavior. \n\nAlso the empathy approach sadly isn\u2019t working, especially if the mom isn\u2019t backing it up.", "NTA I did this kind of thing allot as a kid. Had no idea why people wouldn't be friends with me. Turns out I'm autistic. I'm not saying this is that case, 11 year old girls can be vicious. But if she is not malicious and just straight up confused by you telling her the truth, try to explore this route.", "Get that kid into therapy, it sounds like they're going through some difficult mental cycles and like your mom might need help educating her on it", "NTA don't do any of the things you were doing before. It seems she needs to learn on her own how cruel your sister is getting. My mom did the same with my younger brothers and they still act like they can do no wrong, they're now adults and unbearable", "NTA\n\nIt's clear that your sister needs to learn to treat people with decency and respect.\n\nI would suggest calling a family meeting with your Mum, sister and you to discuss the issues with Sarah and come up with a plan. You guys need to be a united front because she's coming into adolescence if not in the early stages already so she needs clear, firm boundaries now more than ever.", "NTA. Might your mom coddle Sarah because she feels guilty that she works so much and that she is a single parent? Growing up, I remember someone in my friend group being treated this way- her parents were divorced and stuck up for her no matter what she did and caved into her every demand- the friendship did not last long. \n\nI think the best thing you can do is continue to be a positive role model to Sarah and be honest with her, like you were. Eleven is plenty old enough to know that bullying someone for their weight is wrong, and to start showing concern for her friends' feelings. Even if you didn't mean to hurt someone, if it hurt someone, you should care.", "You youngest sister's inability to understand at all why calling someone fat and ugly could be hurtful worries me.  The lack of empathy or ability to see another person's perspective will not serve her well., and could indicate some problems that should be addressed ASAP>\n\nI would suggest that you ask her school guidance counselor for the name of a good child therapist.  If money or lack of proper health insurance to cover therapy is an issue, get a referral to a community clinic.\n\nMeanwhile, you mom needs some parenting help.  Hopefully the child therapist will also talk with her, or maybe there are parenting classes nearby.  Perhaps she'll listen if someone else gives her input on how to raise her child as there are clearly some deficits including lack of internet supervision which could jeopardize your sister's safety.\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA. Everything you suggested is exactly what a parent should do after being given a huge red flag by none other that the daughter herself. Bad behavior when nipped in the bud early prevents a troublesome preteen from becoming a bratty and nightmarish teenager in only a few years.", "NTA - but you can\u2019t abandon your family and allow your sister to fall into ruin. \nBe Frank with little sister and don\u2019t sugar coat things.

You are not the person with the most power over her life - you barely even have power over your own, which I guarantee she\u2019s noticed. Why would she listen to your advice? She doesn\u2019t see anything enviable about your situation.

It takes a village to raise a child", "The point is that if she were a paid live-in nanny, her room and board would be *part* of her compensation, in *addition* to her salary. \n\nPaying only room and board is a deal for mom.
