From what I can gather it\u2019s a bit a of racism and money. His aunts all married money and white whereas his mom is mixed and not from money. So growing up his aunts never really treated him well and he always felt like the poor country cousin. (This is what he\u2019s told me). Anyway so he\u2019s basically not spoken to any of them after pointing out that they don\u2019t in fact treat him like family vs his cousins. \n\nOnto the issue at hand. Our public schools are horrendous. The private schools however have a wait list and you pretty much have to register before your kid is born. My husbands aunt works at the school that\u2019s at the top of our list. I was speaking with my mom and she mentioned that she found out his aunt works there and I should call the office and reach out to her for info and advice on how best to get my daughter is. I mentioned my husband doesn\u2019t speak with her and she said that shouldn\u2019t matter at the end of the day it\u2019s what\u2019s best for my daughter. \n\nI know my husband wouldn\u2019t really want to speak with her but his judgment is very clouded when it comes to his family and he himself would say he isn\u2019t always rational. \n\nSo WIBTA if I reached out to her even though they are NC\n\nEdit: My husband assumes the reason he wasn\u2019t close with his aunts is because his mom was not white and from money. I don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve never met any of these people. To my knowledge in all the stories I\u2019ve heard from him he\u2019s never said they\u2019ve said racist things to him just that he wasn\u2019t as close with them as his other cousins.\n\nUpdate: So after the overwhelming consensus that I would in fact be the AH. I spoke to my husband and in an absolute shock to me he said he\u2019d message her and is currently composing a message to her now. \n\nI also confirmed with my husband that she or his sisters made racist statements towards him or his mom. He assumed that was why however this particular aunt is his Godmother and the reason they stopped speaking was because he made some harsh comments to her about not reaching out to him more on his birthday etc even though she\u2019s his godmother. He said before they had the falling out she would send him a Christmas present every year", "created_utc": 1672924091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103yj9z/wibta_for_reaching_out_to_my_husbands_aunt_who_he/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Anytime you have to go behind your partners back and essentially keep secrets, you are damaging the trust between you two. Do what's best for your daughter, but include your husband in the decision. Have a conversation with him and if needed, have a mediator involved if you both recognize he isn't always rational when issues surrounding his family are confronted.", "YWBTA. Your husband should be able to count on his wife backing him up in being NC with people who treat him badly, and not go behind his back and try to network with them.", "Please remember that your daughter is going to come into contact with this person.

You would be the BIGGEST AH. \n\nAs someone who has been NC with members of their family for years now, if someone went behind my back and contacted them, I would feel betrayed and that a boundary had been violently violated. I would also really wonder if I could trust that person going forward. \n\nWhen someone goes NC with family, it's usually for a very good reason and it often isn't a decision that was come to lightly. \n\nI understand you want what is best for your daughter, but you also need to respect your husband.", "YWBTA. Without one shred of a doubt \n\nHe\u2019s endured a lifetime of racism, classism, and he was made to not feel like part of his family. There has to be deep pain there. And for you to even mitigate it with \u2018his judgement is clouded\u2019 is super fucked up. Did you live his life? Did you feel his pain? You are supposed to be his life partner, to support him and vice versa. Not honoring something so deeply rooted to him is honestly disgusting.\n\nAnd tbh, I wouldn\u2019t want my daughter anywhere near her.", "YTA. And to be perfectly clear from selfish perspective - don't forget that NC goes both ways. If she has not been in contact with your husband, maybe she doesn't want to too, so you contacting her would not benefit your child at all.", "YWBTA and possibly harming your daughter's chances. Why would a mean, racist aunt help her? She might even get in the way just to be petty. This is a terrible idea for more than one reason. You and your mom need to back off.", "Wow YWBTA - your husband doesn\u2019t claim them as family, so why are you trying to use her as family? \n\nYou are fine validating your husbands feelings of no contact, until it benefited you. Then you want to disregard them. \n\nYou say they\u2019re racist, then comment your husband may be mistaken and they\u2019re not. This either leads me to believe you put it in originally for sympathy and it wasn\u2019t working or you don\u2019t care if they are as long as it benefits your daughter. \n\nEither way, you didn\u2019t care about these people enough to want to know them for pleasure, so you don\u2019t get to pretend to care about them when it works for you.", "YWBTA. Your mom gave you horrible advice.", "YTA if you do this without talking to your husband first. \n\nHe may well decide that he can put his feelings aside and have you do this for the sake of his daughter, or it may be that some wounds cut too deep and he doesn't want his daughter anywhere near this aunt. \n\nIn either case, it has to be his choice here. He's the one with with the family history and the hurt to go with it. Going behind his back would just tell him that you don't care at all about what he wants, and that's no way to run a marriage or co-parent a child. \n\nIt also sounds like your daughter is not yet school-aged AND that there are other private schools you can pursue. Also, even bad public schools can be workable for the early years, so it's likely not the end of the world if she has to go that route for a few years. \n\nIn any case, you need to talk to your husband about this and take his opinion to heart as to what he wants to do.", "YTA.  You have all these comments about how they may not really be racist, or your husband maybe wrong and he may acknowledge it.\n\nIf you\u2019re tiptoeing around and doing this all behind your husbands back\u2026.then you know there\u2019s something wrong with what you\u2019re doing.  YTA.  If this is what you think is best for your daughter - you should be able to sit down with your husband and lay out the facts.  Going behind his back makes it seem like you think there may be truth to what he\u2019s said about his family, you just don\u2019t care.", "YTA if you do it without telling your husband. Going NC is pretty drastic, it is usually not something you do for your entertainment. I would rely on your own resources to get your daughter into a good school. You don't want to depend on racists or people that your husband doesn't want to associate with.", "YTA if you don't discuss it with your husband. Don't go behind his back and respect the response he gives. You don't really know what happened between them so you can't really judge on how serious it is. If he is NC, he probably has a good reason for it.", "Without your edit i would say absolutely you would be the asshole. With your edit tho, the only thing ive to say is be extra hyper-vigilant and make sure he is really really okay. Hes Obviously doing this to help his child, which is what a good parent does. Go extra hard on being a good partner cos this cant be easy and he needs a soft place to rest.", "Ask your husband, maybe he'll be able to put some feelings aside for the sake of your daughter.

I know in my area(not assuming this is everywhere) there are quite a few charter schools and co-op homeschooling groups(non-religious and religious options).

Do you have other mom friends with children around the same age? Maybe you could get advice from them on where they plan to send their children. Or maybe they are in the same position as you, and you could all pull money together to hire a private tutor to teach your children and start your own homeschooling co-op. That way, you could still focus on your career and feel better about your daughter's safety and education. You could also have more input into the curriculum and activities that way. It may not be the best long-term solution, but it could give you a year or two more to try and get her into a private school in the area.\n\nI would still say not to reach out to your husbands aunt without his permission. If you had a strong boundary and he crossed it, even if he said it was for the best interest of your child, you would still be hurt and likely lose some trust for him. \n\nAgain, I really wish you luck and hope it all works out!!
