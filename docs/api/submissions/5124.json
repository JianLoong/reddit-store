I won't sugar coat my behavior or attitude during my first marriage. I was working hard to support my family and I neglected my wife and kids.  All I wanted when I got home was to have some food and peace and quiet.  \n\nEventually my ex wife left me.  She took the kids.  I tried my best to see them when I could but it wasn't a lot.  I'm not in any way shape or form blaming my ex for the breakdown of our marriage or my kids for our crappy relationship.  \n\nMy ex remarried about five years after our divorce.  Her husband is a good man and he makes her happy like I wouldn't.  He is also a good stepfather to my kids.  I would not go so far as to say that we are friends but we are friendly.  \n\nI concentrated on my career for a long time after my divorce.  But eleven years later I met someone.  I was 45 and she was 34. Her daughter was 12. At the time my older kids would have been 20 and 17.  \n.\nBy the time I got remarried I was in a better place financially.  And I only had one more year of child support.  So my life was easier.  I had money in the bank for the older kids. Both for their education and to help them start off on their own.  \n\nSince they graduated we have not seen each other much.  I walked my daughter down the aisle with her stepdad.  I have had them over to my home and visited them.  But not often.  \n\nMy ex and her husband sold their house and moved into a retirement community a few years ago.  \n\nI have my two kids from my second marriage living with us. My stepdaughter has graduated from college and moved out.  \n\nMy oldest son lost his job this summer and they went through their savings over the last six months.  They need a place to stay.  He called me to see if they could stay with me.  \n\nI talked with my wife and we decided it was a bad idea.  I instead offered to rent them an apartment where they could stay.  \n\nHe has taken that as me not wanting him in my home.  I thought it was a good way to help him. Yes I have room in my house for him and his family.  But our kids don't get along.  My grandchildren seem to resent having an aunt and uncle who are younger than them.  I don't know.  \n\nSo now my ex, my oldest daughter, and my son are saying that I am prioritizing my new family over his family and that I'm an asshole for doing that.  I sort of am. But I also offered to pay for an apartment. No strings attached.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT\n\nMay I ask a question?  I have been reading this sub for a while.  Sometimes kids get called greedy for expecting their university to be fully funded by their parents. But sometimes the parents get called AHs for considering paying for university so that their kid can start their adult life without debt going beyond the basics.

But I can also see why your oldest son feels like you\u2019re prioritizing your other children over him. Maybe he wanted to stay with you to help his relationship with you, more bonding time or something? I think your other kids are old enough to be civil to your oldest kids and should be rather than how they seem to act. Who would be coming to stay with your son, his wife/gf etc? Do they have a child? I would try talking to him to find out what is reasoning is to want to stay with you rather than take the offer of having their own place.", "NTA. \n\nMostly because you have offered to house them separately.

He is asking for family support, and you yet again throw money at the issue to make it disappear. \n\n\nThey are correct. You have never allowed yourself to emotionally connect with your first children, yet here you are all supportive of your second family while still brushing off your first. \n\nShame on you for not fixing your lack of emotional attachment to your children, that missing connection screws childrens heads up well into adulthood. Don't worry, at least your second family can help care for you in your old age and can sing your praises at your funeral as the first family has no responsibility towards you ever.", "NTA.

I'm not saying you should let them stay at your house but maybe try to be more involved with your older kids", "YTA, you\u2019ve always prioritized your job and now your new family over your son.

Yes, you are prioritizing your new family. But you offered to rent them an apartment. It's okay to not want people in your home even if they are family. It's not like you don't want to help them. You just want to help them on your terms. I think that's fair.", "NTA.  Paying for apartment is pretty generous.  You really have no obligation to let him stay in your house, especially since other members of your family don't get along with him.  Also, since your ex is so critical, why can't he stay with her?", "I mean, you\u2019re obviously allowed to say no but you\u2019re ABSOLUTELY an AH for letting the situation get this far. He\u2019s your son and you don\u2019t seem to care that you\u2019re treating one part of your family way better than the other. If you want a relationship with your kids then buck up mister. You CREATED these people, do better in their lives.", "More Info Needed. There's way more to the story that's not being said.", "NTA.\n\nYour offer was very generous and your attempt to keep the peace within both of your households is admirable.  Your son is a complete idiot.", "You prioritized your new family but you also didn\u2019t leave your son hanging. NTA", "NTA. You offered to rent them an apartment in lieu of living with you. That's pretty generous. Even families with the best of relationships can find it difficult to live together and you said it yourself that your children and your grandchildren do not get along. That's a recipe for disaster. \n\nThere's just something off about your son being adamant about moving into your house. History aside, you said you don't have the greatest relationship even now so why is he so intent on moving in. I would think a free apartment would suffice.

You took the position \"I love you so much that I am working hard to provide you the comfortable life I didn't have, look at all these things!!\" but your kids wanted dad even if it might have meant less stuff. It took me a long time to understand my mom and where she was coming from and in her sharing her life with me I found that this was in reaction to the trauma of her childhood, she didn't know how to show affection she knew how to buy things and work though and thought if I had what I wanted and needed that I had to know she loved me which wasn't the case obviously. Time softens us and with my son she is far more affectionate which is what I think I am getting from your 2nd go around. Have a conversation with your son, it will be difficult and don't get defensive - he knows you provided item and financial support but you didn't give him the emotional piece he craved and you have to own that. Be humble let him express himself and maybe give him a fucking hug, you both can build something new but it takes work. His reaction to you offer is the result of his feelings towards everything else in the past and likely feels like a rejection (maybe he hoped living with you could even make you closer?), let him cool off and don't rescind your offer as he likely does need the help.

I didn't have a college fund, so lots of people survive without one and parents aren't an AH for not being able to save for college. They become the AH when they put ridiculous rules on them, take them away after promising them to like spend on a new boat, or when they only have a fund for one kid.", "On the Edit Question, I don't think parents are ever AHs for paying for their kids to go to college to avoid debt. As a parent, you want to do everything thing you can to give your kids a leg up in life.\n\nWhether kids are AHs for feeling entitled to their parents paying their tuition is much more situational. If there's never been any talk about parents paying your tuition, or if they clearly can\"t afford it, or have said outright that they're not going to, and you get angry when you don't get money that was never promised, you're the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, if a kid's parents set up the expectant that they're going to pay for your college, then don't, the kid has a right to be upset. The parents have reneged on a promise, and now the kid has to rearrange their life plans on the fly, which can be very overwhelming to a kid just entering the adult world. A kid also has the right to be upset if their parents will pay their sibling's tuition, but not theirs, because of the clear favoritism involved. That's assuming roughly commiserate pricing. If your parents cover all of your brother's in-state tuition at a public university, but only contribute to part of your tuition at an expensive private school, then they've treated you equitably. I've read posts here where parents have reneged on a promise to pay for child's tuition so they can us the money to pay for all of a sibling's tuition at a more expensive school, which is pretty fucked.\n\nHowever (and there are a ton of howevers), if your parents renege on a promise to pay your tuition because of some unforseen hit to the family finances, the situation flips again. Say mom gets cancer, and now your parents are suffering under heaps of medical debt. You would be the asshole to be angry that they are no longer able to pay for your college. You're entitled to feel upset, disappointed, and depressed. But you've not been treated unfairly, except by the universe which fucks us all in end.\n\nIt really could go on and on.

But barely.\n\nETA- it\u2019s much cheaper to be part of a running household and contribute your share by chipping in for part of the bills, helping with chores etc rather than set up a whole new place and run that. Especially when he doesn\u2019t have a job, nor his wife. Given the kids not getting along, and you not bring interested in forcing the issue or showing your younger kids that this is what family does, you are again throwing $ at the problem. I\u2019m sure living with you is not your son\u2019s 1st preference either , since he first went through his savings before coming to you, but he clearly doesn\u2019t have too many alternatives.", "Well since we\u2019ve established that you don\u2019t know a thing about emotions I would refrain from making assumptions about your son\u2019s relationship with his wife", "No, I meant that as a metaphor.", "I feel like you're the type to hold money issues over their heads any time they said something, and the comments show. It just feels like you're deliberately missing the point people have been trying to make because you don't like being held accountable. You say you regret, but do you really? So here's the deal then. With this situation, it seems a lifetime's worth of resentment against you and your family has resurfaced. Your old kids feel you never made the effort you make now for your new family. You didn't fight for them, you neglected them, and now you find them burdensome. They have only seen the money grubbing dad who only knew how to measure love and life with how much money he gave them. But now they see you with your new family and you've obviously prioritized over them. You even let your new family show disdain towards them, even for superficial reasons like being older or younger or whatever it is your new kids are saying. Instead of addressing your new kids behavior in a healthy way or in therapy, you've used them as a scapegoat to cover up the fact that you actually want nothing to do with your old kids or their families. You've moved on. They've developed a lifetime's worth of daddy issues. You're doing things for your new wife that you never did for their mother. You do things for your new kids that you never did for them. You are a constant reminder of what they never had, 2 loving parents and a healthy family. A loving dad. So the best thing to do is just...walk away. Tell them that you don't love them or prioritize them as much as you do your new family. Tell them that you've moved on. Give them closure, and cut off ties. If you want, you can give them a lumpsome of money before cutting off, or not. Either way, I just don't see how this relationship is salvageable when you don't want to. Your son probably thought this would've been a way to bond with you and be a part of your world but you and your family are not interested. So just be done with it, put them out of their misery.", "Read this comment OP. \n\nYou have been a financially responsible parent but not an emotionally responsible parent. \n\nYou seem to have considered your children from your first marriage primarily an economic burden. Your oldest son had six months of savings when he lost his job - he has been extremely responsible. But the message he got from you is \u201cI will throw money at a problem again, but I don\u2019t want you.\u201d", "But son's problem is exactly money. Using money to make things better is exactly what is needed.", "I don't disagree, but getting a place to yourself might be the better option. The children seem younger, so putting them into a place where older relatives resent them is not a good idea.\n\nA bit of a rock and a hard place, but OP can't be an absent father twice over.", "Reddit: did you ever show him you loved him outside of money?\nOP: I gave him 35k after he was 18?\n\nI'm not saying that is nothing to sneeze at. That's wonderful. It's just crazy how OP doesn't get what people mean here.", "and how much do you want to bet that the money is used to control the kids too?", "Right now I'm paying.", "He needs both. I have both. I just don't think living together is a great plan.", "They have no money.  My ex is on a pension. She cannot help much. I'm paying for everything.", "Son\u2019s problem is money, but he didn\u2019t ask for a loan, he asked to stay with family. If their relationship was better this might be a distinction without a difference, but because their relationship is fragile, OP\u2019s solution of renting him a new place rather than inviting him in his home was taken as a slight.", "Logically yes, his own place is better for him and his family, but people aren\u2019t always so rational. To him, it probably feels like OP would rather spend a bunch of extra money to rent another apartment than live under the same roof as him. If his and OP\u2019s relationship were better, I\u2019m sure he would\u2019ve been nothing but grateful for his own place.", "You said in your post you had the room. So why the change. You also said you hardly saw kids, now you taught them sports, how to drive and took them on vacations. This is the fakest post I have ever seen.", "You're missing the fact that this single incident is part of a pattern. Yes, in this scenario, renting for him is an incredibly generous option that most kids who have to move in with their parents as adults would kill for. But this didn't occur in isolation, you've consistently behaved as if you think dispensing money like an ATM is a good substitute for an emotionally and physically available, loving parent. I'm not going to call you an asshole for this particular situation because, yeah, renting a place for him probably is the best option for everyone... but you need to have empathy for his emotional reaction here because it's due to the emotional absence you had in his childhood, it's because of the patterns of behaviour you've displayed until now, ect. That \"you don't want me around\" is an accurate evaluation of your actions *in general* and if you want to fix that broken part of your relationship, you need to take responsibility in your actions in the future *outside of this particular situation*.", "Like a politician giving hush money to an escort. That's not love lol.", "I don't understand how everyone can bash you for something that happened so very many years ago. This is the US. Everyone works too much. So much was/is expected of the Head of Household. My parents worked ALL THE TIME too. But it gave us a home, food, clothes and a large Christmas celebration each year. I am sorry you had to do that to provide for your family. Instead of shaming you for not being there for your family and in that making sure they were fed and clothed. No one can judge you. You're trying now. And in answer to your question; NTA. It's hard to merge \"relative strangers\" into one household. I have seen on this very platform that MOST times that doesn't work. Especially when those folks are already adults and have set ways and preferences that don't necessarily work for another established household's rhythms. Your idea of renting them their own place for them is actually extraordinarily generous. I would advise, though, to discuss **IN DETAIL** the **DURATION**, size and location of where you would like to rent them a place. There may be a lease agreement needed to secure a place. Tell them you respect their privacy and autonomy and want them to be as comfortable as possible. If they are unhappy, that's their problem. Invite their family to join your family for dinners and get togethers. You can become reacquainted in smaller doses. Good luck.", "I'm really sad for you that you don't have any understanding of the value and importance of a parent's love. More sad for your kids, though, because clearly they are missing it.", "If you couldn't provide both after the first child, why weren't you responsible enough to not have more? You were the adult and you failed as a father, you don't get to have excuses.", "I guess, I understand why he'd put the younger ones first tho. Plus he offered to rent a place for his eldest so is not like he's leaving him out in the cold to fend for himself", ">I'm not saying that having his family move into your household is the right choice, but you need to have another talk with him and acknowledge his feelings and better explain why renting a separate house would be better - then talk about some things you can do together (spending time) to grow a real connection based on intimacy rather than money.\n\nYes, I acknowledged that when I wrote the above.", "Oh. Yeah I guess eh. My kids seem to forget that I did try and do stuff with them. They forget the vacations I paid for. They forget the times I used all my free time for the month to explain about how to drive a stick. I'm a terrible father but I remember.", "I paid for his university and gave him $35,000.  That wasn't required since it all happened after he was 18.", "Good response.  I wish I had an award or way to upvote more.  OP, you are NTA in this. You have offered a decent solution to the problem your son is in.  Good luck.", "Ok, that's a fair point but the question isn't is he an asshole just because. He might well be a complete asshole, but let's judge him on the question asked - and on that question, are you really advocating that he should prioritise parenting a grown adult over parenting two minors? \n\nHe is ready and willing to provide what his adult son needs to get back on his feet, but his son and family don't actually need to be resident in OP's home for OP to give that support.

I\u2019m just thinking he seems to have a history of expecting his older kids to take a backseat to whatever his priority of the moment is. But I do think it was generous to help with an apartment.", "You know your comments aren\u2019t helping your case. AT ALL.", "Just like mine, he would take me to expensive vacations but the only time I asked him for help he made it about himself and how much he\u2019s hurt that the vacations and money didn\u2019t make up for him being absent, emotionally neglectful and sowing the kind of affection and care I wanted to other family members but never to me", "A terrible father wouldn't own the situation nor would he be trying to help now. Listen, that many people in one house especially with two sets of adults, is not a great idea. (Ask me how I know!)\n\nYou are trying to help, you are supporting your son. He is asking for more of a relationship, and I think you see that. So now try to add that piece. \n\nI don't think you should be getting bashed that much on here. I think you are making amends.", "That is money. That seems like all you have to offer. Your children never had love. YTA", "I feel like you\u2019re intentionally missing the point here. Admittedly, you were not a great father to him, yet he\u2019s watched you play good dad to your new family. You can keep throwing all the money in the world at your son, but it\u2019s not going to fix this or absolve you from whatever happened in the past. Stop trying to excuse your failures as a parent by talking about all the \u201cstuff\u201d you\u2019ve given them. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA for denying his request to live with you, but over all as a father is a completely different story.", "Are you familiar with Maslow's hierarchy of need? You delivered the bottom tier items to your children, but nothing more. Would you feel successful at work if you only achieved 20% of the goal?

That meant time and emotional distance away from them. \n\nYou spending time away from your first family (aka advancing your career), seems to benefit your new family way more than than your son and daughter. \n\nThe money you have now was at the expense of your ex and kids.", "You were better off with your original tone. A LOT of us are successful and spend quality time with our families.

Please get over yourself.", "that's not the choice so stop pretending it is or was. Renting them an apartment is very generous.

Come on.", "Yeah but I don't think he has to spend his whole life trying to make up for that mistake. And like it or not he has small kids now and those should be a priority over his adult children who don't need him as much anymore, and he is trying to help now that he needs him.\n\nI think the son is still hurt over his dad not being in his life like he's now for his kids and is acting out because of it. And that might be also why the grandkids don't get along with their aunts and uncles. Kids don't care about the family titles (we have similar situations in my family) but they very much pick up on their parents behaviour and mimic it.", "Not homeless.

He decided it made me a bad person.  He went to school and took a job that gives him lots of time with his family.  But it's my money that will pay for his kids education.
