I won't sugar coat my behavior or attitude during my first marriage. I was working hard to support my family and I neglected my wife and kids.  All I wanted when I got home was to have some food and peace and quiet.  \n\nEventually my ex wife left me.  She took the kids.  I tried my best to see them when I could but it wasn't a lot.  I'm not in any way shape or form blaming my ex for the breakdown of our marriage or my kids for our crappy relationship.  \n\nMy ex remarried about five years after our divorce.  Her husband is a good man and he makes her happy like I wouldn't.  He is also a good stepfather to my kids.  I would not go so far as to say that we are friends but we are friendly.  \n\nI concentrated on my career for a long time after my divorce.  But eleven years later I met someone.  I was 45 and she was 34. Her daughter was 12. At the time my older kids would have been 20 and 17.  \n.\nBy the time I got remarried I was in a better place financially.  And I only had one more year of child support.  So my life was easier.  I had money in the bank for the older kids. Both for their education and to help them start off on their own.  \n\nSince they graduated we have not seen each other much.  I walked my daughter down the aisle with her stepdad.  I have had them over to my home and visited them.  But not often.  \n\nMy ex and her husband sold their house and moved into a retirement community a few years ago.  \n\nI have my two kids from my second marriage living with us. My stepdaughter has graduated from college and moved out.  \n\nMy oldest son lost his job this summer and they went through their savings over the last six months.  They need a place to stay.  He called me to see if they could stay with me.  \n\nI talked with my wife and we decided it was a bad idea.  I instead offered to rent them an apartment where they could stay.  \n\nHe has taken that as me not wanting him in my home.  I thought it was a good way to help him. Yes I have room in my house for him and his family.  But our kids don't get along.  My grandchildren seem to resent having an aunt and uncle who are younger than them.  I don't know.  \n\nSo now my ex, my oldest daughter, and my son are saying that I am prioritizing my new family over his family and that I'm an asshole for doing that.  I sort of am. But I also offered to pay for an apartment. No strings attached.  \n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT\n\nMay I ask a question?  I have been reading this sub for a while.  Sometimes kids get called greedy for expecting their university to be fully funded by their parents. But sometimes the parents get called AHs for considering paying for university so that their kid can start their adult life without debt going beyond the basics.

Unless you will eventually expect a return of some kind for the no strings money...", "NTA in this situation but given your history with your older kids I can see how your son takes this as a rejection. I'm wondering why your ex, daughter, and son are so angry since you offered to pay for an apartment?", "Makes sense. You\u2019ve never been there emotionally for him.

But I can also see why your oldest son feels like you\u2019re prioritizing your other children over him. Maybe he wanted to stay with you to help his relationship with you, more bonding time or something? I think your other kids are old enough to be civil to your oldest kids and should be rather than how they seem to act. Who would be coming to stay with your son, his wife/gf etc? Do they have a child? I would try talking to him to find out what is reasoning is to want to stay with you rather than take the offer of having their own place.", "NTA. \n\nMostly because you have offered to house them separately.

He is asking for family support, and you yet again throw money at the issue to make it disappear. \n\n\nThey are correct. You have never allowed yourself to emotionally connect with your first children, yet here you are all supportive of your second family while still brushing off your first. \n\nShame on you for not fixing your lack of emotional attachment to your children, that missing connection screws childrens heads up well into adulthood. Don't worry, at least your second family can help care for you in your old age and can sing your praises at your funeral as the first family has no responsibility towards you ever.", "NTA.

I'm not saying you should let them stay at your house but maybe try to be more involved with your older kids", "YTA, you\u2019ve always prioritized your job and now your new family over your son.

Yes, you are prioritizing your new family. But you offered to rent them an apartment. It's okay to not want people in your home even if they are family. It's not like you don't want to help them. You just want to help them on your terms. I think that's fair.", "NTA.  Paying for apartment is pretty generous.  You really have no obligation to let him stay in your house, especially since other members of your family don't get along with him.  Also, since your ex is so critical, why can't he stay with her?", "I mean, you\u2019re obviously allowed to say no but you\u2019re ABSOLUTELY an AH for letting the situation get this far. He\u2019s your son and you don\u2019t seem to care that you\u2019re treating one part of your family way better than the other. If you want a relationship with your kids then buck up mister. You CREATED these people, do better in their lives.", "More Info Needed. There's way more to the story that's not being said.", "NTA.\n\nYour offer was very generous and your attempt to keep the peace within both of your households is admirable.  Your son is a complete idiot.", "You prioritized your new family but you also didn\u2019t leave your son hanging. NTA", "NTA. You offered to rent them an apartment in lieu of living with you. That's pretty generous. Even families with the best of relationships can find it difficult to live together and you said it yourself that your children and your grandchildren do not get along. That's a recipe for disaster. \n\nThere's just something off about your son being adamant about moving into your house. History aside, you said you don't have the greatest relationship even now so why is he so intent on moving in. I would think a free apartment would suffice.

You took the position \"I love you so much that I am working hard to provide you the comfortable life I didn't have, look at all these things!!\" but your kids wanted dad even if it might have meant less stuff. It took me a long time to understand my mom and where she was coming from and in her sharing her life with me I found that this was in reaction to the trauma of her childhood, she didn't know how to show affection she knew how to buy things and work though and thought if I had what I wanted and needed that I had to know she loved me which wasn't the case obviously. Time softens us and with my son she is far more affectionate which is what I think I am getting from your 2nd go around. Have a conversation with your son, it will be difficult and don't get defensive - he knows you provided item and financial support but you didn't give him the emotional piece he craved and you have to own that. Be humble let him express himself and maybe give him a fucking hug, you both can build something new but it takes work. His reaction to you offer is the result of his feelings towards everything else in the past and likely feels like a rejection (maybe he hoped living with you could even make you closer?), let him cool off and don't rescind your offer as he likely does need the help.

Then there are parents who won't give the kid the fund if they get a liberal arts degree or whatever, and that can be an AH move. I didn't have a college fund, so lots of people survive without one and parents aren't an AH for not being able to save for college. They become the AH when they put ridiculous rules on them, take them away after promising them to like spend on a new boat, or when they only have a fund for one kid.", "On the Edit Question, I don't think parents are ever AHs for paying for their kids to go to college to avoid debt. As a parent, you want to do everything thing you can to give your kids a leg up in life.\n\nWhether kids are AHs for feeling entitled to their parents paying their tuition is much more situational. If there's never been any talk about parents paying your tuition, or if they clearly can\"t afford it, or have said outright that they're not going to, and you get angry when you don't get money that was never promised, you're the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, if a kid's parents set up the expectant that they're going to pay for your college, then don't, the kid has a right to be upset. The parents have reneged on a promise, and now the kid has to rearrange their life plans on the fly, which can be very overwhelming to a kid just entering the adult world. A kid also has the right to be upset if their parents will pay their sibling's tuition, but not theirs, because of the clear favoritism involved. That's assuming roughly commiserate pricing. If your parents cover all of your brother's in-state tuition at a public university, but only contribute to part of your tuition at an expensive private school, then they've treated you equitably. I've read posts here where parents have reneged on a promise to pay for child's tuition so they can us the money to pay for all of a sibling's tuition at a more expensive school, which is pretty fucked.\n\nHowever (and there are a ton of howevers), if your parents renege on a promise to pay your tuition because of some unforseen hit to the family finances, the situation flips again. Say mom gets cancer, and now your parents are suffering under heaps of medical debt. You would be the asshole to be angry that they are no longer able to pay for your college. You're entitled to feel upset, disappointed, and depressed. But you've not been treated unfairly, except by the universe which fucks us all in end.\n\nIt really could go on and on.

With this situation, it seems a lifetime's worth of resentment against you and your family has resurfaced. Your old kids feel you never made the effort you make now for your new family. You didn't fight for them, you neglected them, and now you find them burdensome. They have only seen the money grubbing dad who only knew how to measure love and life with how much money he gave them. But now they see you with your new family and you've obviously prioritized over them. You even let your new family show disdain towards them, even for superficial reasons like being older or younger or whatever it is your new kids are saying. Instead of addressing your new kids behavior in a healthy way or in therapy, you've used them as a scapegoat to cover up the fact that you actually want nothing to do with your old kids or their families. You've moved on. They've developed a lifetime's worth of daddy issues. You're doing things for your new wife that you never did for their mother. You do things for your new kids that you never did for them. You are a constant reminder of what they never had, 2 loving parents and a healthy family. A loving dad. So the best thing to do is just...walk away. Tell them that you don't love them or prioritize them as much as you do your new family. Tell them that you've moved on. Give them closure, and cut off ties. If you want, you can give them a lumpsome of money before cutting off, or not. Either way, I just don't see how this relationship is salvageable when you don't want to.

It requires intense time and effort. It also far more expensive and requires a willingness to risk rejection and public humiliation. You start by offering meaningful apology to each of your children individually and asking what you can do to try and help them move past the damage your actions caused.

Well currently there isn't one. Because of your neglect your new and old family doesn't get along.

First and foremost, explain why you have your wife have decided to support them with the rental unit instead of staying in the home. Don't assume he just knows, as he sure doesn't. Nobody does, hence why you had to have a discussion in the first place with your wife.  \n\n\nSecond, offer emotional support too. How do you do this? Well, can they afford food? invite them over for meals, or offer to bring them meals. Offer to watch the grandkids while they go out job hunting or whatever it is. Invite your son and/or out for coffee to give them a little reprise for what is undoubtedly a hugely stressful part of their life and to spend some time with you. Make an effort to be involved and encourage your wife to do so as well, if she is welcomed by them. Is someone having a birthday or a life event (doesn't matter how big) plan and host a party for them. Make them feel special and loved, which can 100% be done even if you don't have them live with you, but you HAVE to be INTENTIONAL about it.", "NTA.

Another rejection from a father that was admittedly largely absent from his life.

And that you were distant, makes me kind of wonder why they still wanted to be in your life or have you involved in theirs. \n\nYour son on the other hand, the question is what I want to know is what is his plans and back up plans as an adult?  In this modern age, even with everything before hand and now, one should know enough to always have a back up plan in the event of something happening that will impact him.  The fact he lost his job, that happens, but why didn't he or his wife immediately seek out another job, any job that would help bring in money into the house?  Did he reject say working at McDonalds?  And what about state aid, to help when times are really tough?  Every little bit helps and it is one that kind of makes me wonder what really is going on to where he drains his savings and is now hitting rock bottom with his family there, and they are seeking a life line.\n\nThe bigger question here is why are you keeping your children away from you?  Your offer was very generous and one your son would be a fool to turn down, but there is a ring of truth to his words there, that you seem to be pushing them away time and time again, so why are you pushing them away as you have for so many years?\n\nI grew up with a father like you.  Work, career, and provided what I needed growing up.  What he never got, was the one thing that all of his children needed, was a dad who was there and supportive of them, in an emotional way, to get to know them.  In the end of his life, it was his biggest regret.  As non of his children, were willing to be there for him when he most needed them to help him and his wife out.

That wasn\u2019t even in his wheelhouse. Didn\u2019t even know it was an option. Never even seen it happen. The man is 70 and still has to have people remind him that you should call your kids sometimes. He assumes no news is good news because calls from his parents were always for help. \n\nAnd do I still get mad that he can only seem to provide money and that now that I don\u2019t need it, he\u2019s fresh out of ideas?  Sure. But I\u2019ve accepted his limitations. I\u2019ve seen him give more in new relationships, but I\u2019ve also seen him lose interest or pushback when what they want is outside his comfort zone.

I think faking that would be far worse than admitting you aren\u2019t perfect, but are willing to help where you can to make things right. But I do think that many people just go about having kids when they really aren\u2019t suited for the lifestyle. People like myself recognize that we just aren\u2019t really the typical family kind of person. We can still do good in the world by contributing to society through work and spreading any excess gains to people who need it, but having kids \u201cjust because it\u2019s what you do\u201d and not because you actively, excitedly want them sets them up for emotional distress.\n\nI had parents that fought constantly, had a nasty divorce, and left me and my brother with nothing for college.

My dad has offered to help me with rent when I was searching for jobs, and even though I managed I was extremely grateful for the safety net. \n\nI knew my dad didn\u2019t really want kids, he just wanted the Kodak moments when he took us camping and fishing. My mom on the other hand really just wanted to be a mom. The difference was obvious to me and I coped, but my mom and brother suffered greatly when he became more and more detached.

His mother loves the shit out of him. She cannot afford to pay all his family's bills.  Why did he come to me?  For love?", "No that's crazy lol its nice if you can but certainly not required. I never got a thing from my parents but I don't care about that, I care that they couldn't give a single fuck about my emotional well-being and mental state.", "Yes.  And she married a good man. I wonder why my son came to me for help I stead of them?  Oh wait I know.  They have no money.  They live off his pension.  Yes I'm a shit father. I know this. But I can help when no one else can.", "And because of that shitty decision now that my son is in serious financial need I have money.", "I don't think you know what that word means.", "Right now I am paying all the bills for his family.  All.  Food, utilities, fuel, insurance, keep going.  God forbid that you needed to do this for your daughter, her husband, and two children could you do it?", "I give OP credit for admitting that he was a bad parent (god knows my parents don\u2019t!) and taking some measures to make up for it, but the comment about just wanting \u201cpeace and quiet\u201d when he gets home rubbed me the wrong way too. Everyone wants that, but most parents are able to get it together to spend time with their kids. He says he doesn\u2019t \u201csugarcoat\u201d but then goes on to find a legit reason for why he neglected his wife and kids.", "Keep on going with that boomer energy, it won\u2019t make you any less of an awful person.", "Right. And while I understand that I could be more emotionally supportive I think that if I were in his position my emotional state would be improved by someone taking literally all the financial burden off of me.", "Ok, let's put aside whether or not you made the right choice when your kids were young. Do you want any real relationship with your son?  \n\nBecause if he had accepted that all he can get from you is financial support, he would have accepted the offer of the rented apartment with nothing else said. What he was also hoping for was some level of emotional support from his father. You seem to have written off any hope of emotional closeness with your son but he has not done the same. TALK TO HIM. BE HONEST. He's an adult, he will recognize that it's reasonable not to put both your families in a crowded negative environment. Ask him what will make him feel most supported- weekly lunches together, reaching out to any friends you have for opportunities for him, being a person for him to vent stress to?", "I do. You just only think of fatherhood as financial contribution. There\u2019s a lot more to being a parent than just money. Yes it helps, but your children want connection too. They want support through other means rather than just you buying/paying for things. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you worked your way up for your career, but you missed out on time with your children. And they will remember that more than what you paid for. \n\nI think you\u2019re more than generous with the offer to rent an apartment for them, but like many others say, he wants a dad to be there for him rather than you just solving another problem with money. Maybe try to compromise by offering the apartment again but invite them over for dinner once a week/every other week or something. Show him that you want to spend time with him in this hard time.", "You have nothing to give your family but money and keep saying it louder and louder. Try to compose a single post about your relationship with your son where your contribution is as something other than his financier.", "Boomer with financial resources.", "Yes. The financial help is big for sure, but needs to be combined with some emotional support as well. I'm definitely no expert in what that looks like lol but I have seen some good suggestions in the comments", "I think the difference is he was carrying two burdens: the financial struggles and emotional struggles. Removing the financial struggles just frees up the mind to focus on the emotional pain I\u2019m sure this situation has rehashed for him. I really hope you\u2019re able to talk this out with your kids though and repair your relationship!", "Because he thought saying that was enough, didn't think he'd actually have to change."]}
