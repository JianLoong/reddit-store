I'm not in any way shape or form blaming my ex for the breakdown of our marriage or my kids for our crappy relationship.  \n\nMy ex remarried about five years after our divorce.  Her husband is a good man and he makes her happy like I wouldn't.  He is also a good stepfather to my kids.  I would not go so far as to say that we are friends but we are friendly.  \n\nI concentrated on my career for a long time after my divorce.  But eleven years later I met someone.  I was 45 and she was 34. Her daughter was 12. At the time my older kids would have been 20 and 17.  \n.\nBy the time I got remarried I was in a better place financially.  And I only had one more year of child support.  So my life was easier.  I had money in the bank for the older kids. Both for their education and to help them start off on their own.  \n\nSince they graduated we have not seen each other much.  I walked my daughter down the aisle with her stepdad.  I have had them over to my home and visited them.  But not often.  \n\nMy ex and her husband sold their house and moved into a retirement community a few years ago.  \n\nI have my two kids from my second marriage living with us. My stepdaughter has graduated from college and moved out.  \n\nMy oldest son lost his job this summer and they went through their savings over the last six months.  They need a place to stay.  He called me to see if they could stay with me.  \n\nI talked with my wife and we decided it was a bad idea.  I instead offered to rent them an apartment where they could stay.  \n\nHe has taken that as me not wanting him in my home.  I thought it was a good way to help him. Yes I have room in my house for him and his family.  But our kids don't get along.  My grandchildren seem to resent having an aunt and uncle who are younger than them.  I don't know.  \n\nSo now my ex, my oldest daughter, and my son are saying that I am prioritizing my new family over his family and that I'm an asshole for doing that.  I sort of am.

But I can also see why your oldest son feels like you\u2019re prioritizing your other children over him. Maybe he wanted to stay with you to help his relationship with you, more bonding time or something? I think your other kids are old enough to be civil to your oldest kids and should be rather than how they seem to act. Who would be coming to stay with your son, his wife/gf etc? Do they have a child? I would try talking to him to find out what is reasoning is to want to stay with you rather than take the offer of having their own place.", "NTA. \n\nMostly because you have offered to house them separately.

I think you should invite him over and explain.", "YTA, you think your only support as a parent is financial. He is asking for family support, and you yet again throw money at the issue to make it disappear. \n\n\nThey are correct. You have never allowed yourself to emotionally connect with your first children, yet here you are all supportive of your second family while still brushing off your first. \n\nShame on you for not fixing your lack of emotional attachment to your children, that missing connection screws childrens heads up well into adulthood. Don't worry, at least your second family can help care for you in your old age and can sing your praises at your funeral as the first family has no responsibility towards you ever.", "NTA.

I'm not saying you should let them stay at your house but maybe try to be more involved with your older kids", "YTA, you\u2019ve always prioritized your job and now your new family over your son.

Yes, you are prioritizing your new family. But you offered to rent them an apartment. It's okay to not want people in your home even if they are family. It's not like you don't want to help them. You just want to help them on your terms. I think that's fair.", "NTA.  Paying for apartment is pretty generous.  You really have no obligation to let him stay in your house, especially since other members of your family don't get along with him.  Also, since your ex is so critical, why can't he stay with her?", "I mean, you\u2019re obviously allowed to say no but you\u2019re ABSOLUTELY an AH for letting the situation get this far. He\u2019s your son and you don\u2019t seem to care that you\u2019re treating one part of your family way better than the other. If you want a relationship with your kids then buck up mister. You CREATED these people, do better in their lives.", "More Info Needed. There's way more to the story that's not being said.", "NTA.\n\nYour offer was very generous and your attempt to keep the peace within both of your households is admirable.  Your son is a complete idiot.", "You prioritized your new family but you also didn\u2019t leave your son hanging. NTA", "NTA. You offered to rent them an apartment in lieu of living with you. That's pretty generous. Even families with the best of relationships can find it difficult to live together and you said it yourself that your children and your grandchildren do not get along. That's a recipe for disaster. \n\nThere's just something off about your son being adamant about moving into your house. History aside, you said you don't have the greatest relationship even now so why is he so intent on moving in. I would think a free apartment would suffice.

You took the position \"I love you so much that I am working hard to provide you the comfortable life I didn't have, look at all these things!!\" but your kids wanted dad even if it might have meant less stuff. It took me a long time to understand my mom and where she was coming from and in her sharing her life with me I found that this was in reaction to the trauma of her childhood, she didn't know how to show affection she knew how to buy things and work though and thought if I had what I wanted and needed that I had to know she loved me which wasn't the case obviously. Time softens us and with my son she is far more affectionate which is what I think I am getting from your 2nd go around. Have a conversation with your son, it will be difficult and don't get defensive - he knows you provided item and financial support but you didn't give him the emotional piece he craved and you have to own that. Be humble let him express himself and maybe give him a fucking hug, you both can build something new but it takes work. His reaction to you offer is the result of his feelings towards everything else in the past and likely feels like a rejection (maybe he hoped living with you could even make you closer?), let him cool off and don't rescind your offer as he likely does need the help.
