Acknowledge that while you're grieving the loss of a husband, they are also grieving the loss of a child, and that you want to return the jewelry if it will help relieve them of some of that grief.

Grief does funny things to people. Given what you've described, it's possible that on some level deep down MIL feels that by battling with you she is, in a very twisted and unhealthy way, keeping \"in contact\" with her son, or at least keeping his memory alive.

My husband wasn't even buried yet. I ended up not using him because he wouldn't listen, and the cousin was doing shady stuff.

I had his log in information and transferred the funds. \n\nHis cousin posted on FB that our house should go to his mom. He didn't love me that much to give it to me. WE BOUGHT IT TOGETHER!
