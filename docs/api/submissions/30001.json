But of course- they make me seem like the nightmare to everyone else unfortunately. thank you, I have contacted a lawyer and spoken about a restraining order. The issue is they reside in a different state, so a bit challenging to maintain the restraining order over state lines-  but lawyer was able to confirm they have no legal right to ask me for anything.", "No, call a lawyer", "Thank you, I agree. More than the attachment to the items- I think I overall just feel disgusted that she is even asking me for gifts from over 6 years ago and the fact that they were gifts give to DH and myself, not her.\n\n Truthfully- at this point, I don't even know what gifts came from their family side vs what gifts came from my family side. My DH & I had also exchanged some of the gifts that we were not going to use. You are 100% right, it does pick at the scab of a wound that's healing and I feel like that is what is killing me.", "The problem is, with that kind of people, if OP gives in on one thing they're going to feel even more entitled and demand everything. \n\nWith that kind of people, the only thing you can say is: \"Nothing for you here.

For quite a few years it drove me crazy that they had such a skewed vision of who I am. They never even got to know me, so it all came from my bitter, hateful ex who gleefully admitted to me that he had lied to his family about me for our entire relationship. (His excuse is that he never wanted to take the chance that they'd take my side) Finally, I realized that I'm the only one agonizing about it. None of them cared about me so why let them tear me apart inside? It was a great relief to finally get there.

Not yours.", "This mil sounds so unhinged that she will probably file a claim suit that the jewelry were family heirlooms.

Make sure it is a really tough attorney too with a reputation for being tough. NC is a good start, but best to respond aggressively with an attorney letter.

There are lots of countries with states, instead of provinces or territories...", "Also, depending on where OP is, it may be harassment.", "It's not slander or libel to lie to someone's face. There's no indication the MIL is saying lies to other people, which is what slander and libel are.", "Narrator: \"She isn't. It isn't.\"", "If she doesn't take the calls, the harassment ends. So there's nothing actionable. No one is slandering or libeling her to others--the false claims are being made directly to HER, so they're not harming her other than being annoying. No one is trespassing or threatening harm. The MIL is being an asshole, sure, but there's nothing illegal going on. No lawyer would take this case since there is no case to take."]}
