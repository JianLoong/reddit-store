Started dating at 16. Still together now. I know that doesn't always work for people but it worked for us.\n\nThis weekend, I was hanging out at a friends house with a bunch of people. There was a girl there who is a friend of one of my friends girlfriend. We'll call her Jane. I don't know her that well but I see her around often because we are in the same friend circle. \n\nDrinks were flowing and somehow the topic came up about how many being everyone has slept with. Jane  was shocked when I mentioned I had only slept with one person. \n\nContext, Jane also married her high school sweetheart. They broke up when she found out that he had basically cheated the whole relationship with multiple women. One of his piss poor excuses was that he hadn't had a chance to have fun or play the field yet before settling down. \n\nAnyway, she couldn't believe I have only had sex with my wife, and said that I must have. I told her even if I had, why would I admit it? I've been with my wife since we were 16. Admitting to it would mean admitting I have cheated, which I haven't. In response to that she just said that must mean that I have and I'm lying about it.\n\nAt this point, I am getting annoyed because she is straight up accusing me of being unfaithful. She said she know from experience how unlikely it is. That's when I said that just because her husband was shitty, doesn't mean we all are. She just mumbled a \"whatever\" and was quite for the rest of the night. \n\nI was talking to my friend the next day who said her girlfriend told him how upset Jane got over that. She apparently said that I know what she has been through and could have been more understanding. I said I understand what she's been through but she doesn't need put her issues on me and basically accuse me of cheating. My friend said he understood but probably would have been best to just leave it.

How could you have \"been more understanding\" or \"left it\" without leaving her accusation hanging unaddressed?", "NTA, she is protecting her trauma onto your relationship. You know whether you have cheated or not and that is most important. I truly hope for her that she will learn that not everybody is like her asshole ex-husband.", "NTA. She didn't have to believe you, but she didn't have to harangue and cross-question you in a public social event. I'm not sure what else you were supposed to do or say in the circumstances.", "NTA. Being understanding doesnt mean just taking attacks on your character.", "It's hard for you to \"leave\" something when she's publicly accusing you of cheating.   Many people present would have taken that as an admission of guilt.   **Jane** sounds like she would have taken it that way. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nShe's the one who brought up her past experience. She was flat out insulting you in multiple ways.

You are are right, not all men are the same. Even though my husband and I weren't lucky enough to be our firsts, we have never cheated on each other and don't believe in it. So not all women are the same either. Hence not all relationships are the same. She is just jealous because she believe his lies and probably has since regretted it.

You had every right to tell her that you hadn't cheated.", "NTA but your initial response of \u201cif I have why would I admit it\u201d may be why she\u2019s on your case.

Going back to those same friends where the f were they, standing up for *you* when this stranger was accusing you of cheating on your wife?", "NTA she's not a victim. You don't have to pander just because her feelings are still hurt. Anyone calling you YTA can sit on an egg. They need to realize they can't be making excuses for rude or inconsiderate behavior..", "Exact same thing happened to me. Girls have one bad experience and go accuse faithful people of cheating for no fucking reason, anyways NTA", "NTA. You could have been more polite about it, using personal attacks isn't a good look, but she was also very rude by accusing you of cheating. You could have handled this more gracefully, but being rude to a rude person does not an asshole make", "Slight YTA due to the \"if I did, why would I admit it\"comment.

She was definitely the shitty one here.\n\nBut if I\u2019m being Very charitable then I can probably guess that the reason she went so hard is that if it Is possible for a man to stay faithful and true with his \u2018first love\u2019 then She must have simply not been enough for him to have him cheat. \nIn her mind obviously, as the cheating is solely on the cheater.", "NTA, her shitty experiences should not be piled onto your shoulders. Not your problem. You put her in her place.", "Jane could have not judged all men by the behaviour of one. \n\nNTA.", "Nta. She was calling you a cheater and liar when you aren\u2019t.", "NTA you friend on the other hand is. Just because she was cheated on doesn't mean every guy is like that. You stood up for yourself and your relationship. Your friend should have  respect for you and your wife and understand that you will not accept being called a cheater to make her feel better. Accusations like that can end marriages.", "Nta. She has a bad relationship so assumes billions of men are just like hers was. Sadly that twisted logic is pervasive.", "NTA. The only other option was to let Jane contimue her accusations. But you should probably tell your wife about that convo. Reason being now Jane could be spiteful enough to try and sabotage your marriage.", "NTA you don\u2019t go around just accusing people of doing bad things and then playing victim. She has atrocious manners and if anything she owes you an apology\u2014I\u2019m petty and as the wife in the situation would demand an apology for her nasty comments about my marriage. She needs to work through her issues, they are hers alone.", "I had a friend like Jane. Once went off in our car, belittling her husband and going on and on saying she\u2019d cheat - in front of the guy!! - if he wasn\u2019t \u201cmeeting her needs\u201d or something weird. Took me a whole while to figure out (way after I cut her from life, and thanks to some good friends) that she was horribly jealous of mine and my husband\u2019s relationship - which as I\u2019ve discovered from Reddit - isn\u2019t uncommon :(\n\nShe did a lot to cause trouble and I was too blind to see it. Luckily, the trouble did not last. \n\nOP - you\u2019re NTA. It\u2019s sweet and frankly, I\u2019m jealous of the childhood sweethearts thing you have (but not jealous to want to get in the middle of it!!)", "NTA: But DO NOT tell people about your sexual history. They have no right to the info. Protect your wife\u2019s privacy if not your own.", "NTA. Tell Jane to stop pushing her insecurities on other people and creating social rules for how a man must be. Quite frankly, I am not in agreement that you should have \"just denied it.\" You were being accused of being unfaithful and there's no requirement for you to be kind after that since she brought up her own experience first and was projecting her own stuff onto you. She brought up her experience, and you addressed the situation from that perspective. Totally fair.", "NTA\n\nthis is why there are phrase like Fuck Around, Found Out.\nJane did FAFO, and got hurt and blaming you hurting her to all of her friend.. Jane is Narcissistic..", "What was shitty was Jane accusing you of being a liar and a cheater. Imagine thinking she deserves any sympathy. NTA", "I mean my friend was mainly just echoing what his girlfriend was saying. I don't think he cares either way.", "The general consensus seems to be that I could have just denied it. That I didn't have to bring up her experience.\n\nMy response to that was that I did deny it. She didn't drop it until I mentioned her ex-husband. Mission accomplished if you ask me.", "I think she still has a long way to go. It's been a good few years now since she broke up with her husband and hasn't been able to maintain another relationship since. She ends up jeopardising it because of her insecurities. Like, I genuinely do feel bad for her but she still doesn't get to accuse me like that. Especially when we only acquaintances at best. We really don't know each other that well.", "I really don't care if she thinks of me that way or not. My wife trusts me and that's all that matters. It was just her shear confidence that all men are like that just because her husband was. Really annoyed me.", "Yeah, my eyebrows raised at that \"why woukd I admit it\" comment too. I have no problems with OP defending himself against those kinds of narrow-minded and biased accusations, but that does seem like a weird thing to say.\n\nAnyway, OP, NTA. You are under no obligation to allow someone to attack you so that she can feel better about herself and her situation.", "This is basically what I said. I do feel bad about what she went through but it has nothing to do with me.", "He really was giving \"if I had done it\" vibes.", ">Your friend is wrong. When someone accuses you of something that bad, you call them out on it.\n\nWhy?\n\nFor the record, I don't think that OP is the asshole but instead of engaging he could have just said \"whatever makes you sleep better at night\" and enjoyed his evening instead of fighting and posting here", "I mean, it's true though. Why would I admit? So one of them can tell my wife? Was just trying to show her that she was wasting her time more than anything else.", "> It reminds me of the book \u201cIf I did it, Here\u2019s How it Happened.\u201d by OJ Simpson lol\n\nIf you haven't seen the new cover to the book, it's gold.

The \"if\" is still there, but it's... pretty difficult to see compared to the rest of the title.", "Yeah I saw that part and it was a weird choice of words. That whole part of the conversation was going in a strange direction. I would have just left it at \"I didn't.\"", "I think it's an ego defense mechanism, \"it happened to me and I'm not even nieve...oh gawd it's definitely happening to Stephanie\"", "I mean, I told her a simple no before I said that. She was the one who carried on.", "Maybe not... but either way, he needs to shut up. He's wrong, his GF is wrong, Jane is wrong, they're all AHs here, and you are NTA.", "Exactly.  You didn't stir anything up, she did by continuing to push.  She refused to drop it until she got an answer she didn't like.", "People like your \u201cfriend\u201d are the worst. They want to score points as peacekeepers- but always at your expense and never their own. \n\nIf they\u2019re not willing to defend you then they can shut up about you defending yourself.  Instead they want you to tie your arms behind your back so you\u2019re easier to hit. \n\nThat\u2019s toxic just fyi. You\u2019re allowed to defend yourself with the same energy being thrown at you, especially after you first tried to diffuse the situation.", ">She said she know from experience how unlikely it is.\n\nShe brought it up.", "She brought up her own experience. She used it as justification for her accusations. You just used it to defend yourself. Not like you brought it up out of nowhere.", "Yes totally. It has been proven that a betrayal such as cheating, can alter the way your brain works permanently. That is no excuse for her to project it on you though. It sounds like she could use some help in overcoming her traumatic experiences.", "It is ridiculous. And sexist.", ">\"whatever makes you sleep better at night\n\nthat's still calling them out and no different from \" That's when I said that just because her husband was shitty, doesn't mean we all are\"\n\nNo difference at all, in my opinion.", "I'd say NTA, but you are being a bit na\u00efve. It might be the truth, but it's the truth in the same line of \"yes, those pants do make you look fat.\"\n\nNow, I get your initial thought in thinking that she would drop it after you pointed out that you would never admit to cheating, but that is rarely how anyone is going to take it. \n\nYou gave two statements: 1. I didn't cheat, and 2. I would never tell the truth about cheating. The problem you have, is that the second statement invalidates the first. \n\nLet's just use some random example. Let's say someone says, \"All guys drink and drive\" Which is a better response:\n\n1. That can't be true, as I'm a guy and I don't drink and drive. \n2. That can't be true, as I'm a guy and I don't drink and drive, although, if I did, I wouldn't admit to it.\n\nWhich of these is more convincing?", "as someone with autism, I am under the impression that this phrasing is seen as admitting you do cheat on your wife. I could be wrong, but other people are pointing this out as well.", "I meant hypothetically.", "You didn\u2019t need the hypothetical though. The truth of the matter was that you didn\u2019t cheat, and that alone was solid enough. Your hypothetical didn\u2019t strengthen your claim, it undermined it. \u201cEven if I did, why would I tell you?\u201d implies you did cheat, but are not admitting it to her, which supports her belief that you cheated and are lying about it.", "Sorry autism here. I can't differentiate hypothetically from an admission of guilt cloaked as a hypothetical. Maybe someone else here can pick up on the slight distiction. I'm not able to decern that", "If you bring up a hypothetical situation you are making people think about it.\n\nYou gave her a plausible line of reasoning that justified both your answer of 1, and her believe that you slept with more then 1.  \n\nBe careful with hypotheticals in the future."]}
