Took me a whole while to figure out (way after I cut her from life, and thanks to some good friends) that she was horribly jealous of mine and my husband\u2019s relationship - which as I\u2019ve discovered from Reddit - isn\u2019t uncommon :(\n\nShe did a lot to cause trouble and I was too blind to see it.

Quite frankly, I am not in agreement that you should have \"just denied it.\" You were being accused of being unfaithful and there's no requirement for you to be kind after that since she brought up her own experience first and was projecting her own stuff onto you.

It might be the truth, but it's the truth in the same line of \"yes, those pants do make you look fat.\"\n\nNow, I get your initial thought in thinking that she would drop it after you pointed out that you would never admit to cheating, but that is rarely how anyone is going to take it. \n\nYou gave two statements: 1. I didn't cheat, and 2. I would never tell the truth about cheating. The problem you have, is that the second statement invalidates the first. \n\nLet's just use some random example. Let's say someone says, \"All guys drink and drive\" Which is a better response:\n\n1. That can't be true, as I'm a guy and I don't drink and drive. \n2.

The truth of the matter was that you didn\u2019t cheat, and that alone was solid enough. Your hypothetical didn\u2019t strengthen your claim, it undermined it. \u201cEven if I did, why would I tell you?\u201d implies you did cheat, but are not admitting it to her, which supports her belief that you cheated and are lying about it.", "Sorry autism here. I can't differentiate hypothetically from an admission of guilt cloaked as a hypothetical. Maybe someone else here can pick up on the slight distiction. I'm not able to decern that", "If you bring up a hypothetical situation you are making people think about it.\n\nYou gave her a plausible line of reasoning that justified both your answer of 1, and her believe that you slept with more then 1.  \n\nBe careful with hypotheticals in the future.", "NTA you shut down a brat who claimed you were a lying cheater. No assholery here. Jane wants to dish it out but can't take it.", "NTA, but why are you having conversations like this while socializing?  You\u2019re in your mid-30s.

I recognize her reason for the bitterness but she hopefully she\u2019ll come to realize this isn\u2019t healthy.", "NTA, Jane is though for trying to argue with you and make you admit something you didn\u2019t do. If the roles were reversed you\u2019d have to take responsibility for being inappropriate, Jane needs to take responsibility for being inappropriate and for pushing her issues onto you when you\u2019re not the same person as her husband.", "NTA - and shouldn't we be reinforcing the fact that good guys do exist?", "NTA Why would anyone think you'd be doing Jane a favor by reinforcing her bitter and resentful attitude? She needs to hear that her experience isn't representative of a healthy relationship if she's ever going to have one. \n\n You're never an asshole for defending your character. If Jane can't separate reality from her past trauma, she shouldn't be out drinking.", "NTA\n\nJane is allowed to be surprised about information that challenges her beliefs.

For example, \"My emotions ran high due to a sensitive topic and I became overwhelmed. I apologize for taking that out on you.\" But, there isn't an apology. Jane is making you responsible for her emotions while she's a competent adult who is accountable for her own decisions.", "NTA and you did the right thing to nip this in the bud, touchy subjects like that end up growing and damage relationships and all because she's a bitter asshole", "NTA, but you could\u2019ve left out the part where you said \u201ceven if I did why would I admit it\u201d", "NTA, you were a lot nicer than I would have.

We all have issues in our lives, and painting every one with your experiences is a shallow way to view the world.", "NTA, you were defending yourself from accusations of being a cheater.  \n\nYour friend is also NTA because honestly he's kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place so I'd cut him a bit of slack.  \n\nHis girlfriend, now she's the only one in this situation who was behaving inappropriately by continually pushing the subject and making unfounded accusations.", "NTA but curious who goes around talking about their number as adults with like a group of people, not their partner?", "NTA and pessimistic people kill me.  They want to put all the social ills in the world on everyone else, but when someone calls out their BS behavior or comments, then it becomes, \"Woe is me\".  If you can't take the heat stay out the damn kitchen.  In other words, STFU.", "NTA. You were literally accused of cheating on your wife by a stranger.

Leave it at that next time. \n\nMy twin is like this , where he will sometimes throw out a hypothetical or \"play devil's advocate\" for the sake of doing so, and the majority of people who actually know him will either genuinely answer his question or completely ignore him as to not escalate things. people who are trying to start a conversation, butt in, or are actively engaging in conversation with him without knowing him for long will act exactly like Jane here, and he will act just like you. \n\nHe's getting better, but it was quite a challenge to actually hold a proper conversation because he was so defensive of people who were pushing him on his hypothetical. \n\nMy advice to you would to do the same thing I always say to him: With people who aren't used to how you speak or your mannerisms, be mindful of the things you might say that could potentially put you in situations like the one you were just in. if you don't know what you say that might trigger these kinds of reactions, ask your friends who know you well.", "NTA. She attacked your character and you defended yourself.", "Nta", "Jane was shaking the table and got shook. She was a miserable woman that was operating off her own trauma.

You are 100% right. Sometimes it does work and people don\u2019t cheat. She\u2019s miserable and misery loves company.", "NTA She accused you of cheating and when you told her you had not, she was dismissive. You have every right to be angry. False spoken statement damaging a person's reputation is slander and if she made your wife doubt you, it could result in you having a case against her for wrecking your marriage. Just because she was cheated on, doesn't give her the right to go around accusing other people or give her a free pass. Gossip can ruin people's reputations very easily.", "NTA", "NTA. I hate when people tar whole groups with the same brush because they\u2019ve had a shitty experience with one person.", "NTA, but your friend is ridiculous for even entertaining his girlfriend\u2019s thought.

Being wronged doesn\u2019t give someone carte blanche to be an a-hole with zero repercussions\u2026", "NTA. She\u2019s jealous and hurt that she doesn\u2019t have a faithful partner. She accused you of cheating which is an asshole thing to do.", "NTA you don't get to insult people's character bc you had a bad hand.", "NTA.  Not everyone cheats.
