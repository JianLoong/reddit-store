He parrots the news about how we need to solve the aids crisis, but clearly doesn't give a damn about other people. Even when he is engaged in the act of sex, he focuses more on how cool he looks in the mirror.\n\nAll of this is the shell of an identity, with no person inside it.\n\nHe's not just a bad person because of the murdery parts - which [spoiler] might not actually be happening, since his narration is not reliable.", "Does he know the rules for wearing a sweater vest?", "He doesn't have time for you.

OP's friend personality change is the same as kids who take a gap year and decide to teach surfing along the beaches in South America or claim to experience a spiritual awakening and they reject their slave name and will only respond to their chosen name LilyPad etc. There are so many parents with stories about how their children returned from university on break/post graduation as a shaman or practicing witchcraft or declare themselves sovereign citizens. All of that to say is your 20s is a period of transition and experienceing things vastly different from childhood. Sometimes those changes are for the good (raised with racism/sexism/nationalism but college experiences help to unlearn biased/harmful thinking) or for the bad such as drastically changing their personality to emulate a fictional psychopath/murderer.
