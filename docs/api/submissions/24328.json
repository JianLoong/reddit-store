I met him in my college campus around two years ago and it's only recently we got closer. We've been talking a lot more lately because we've been talking about video games and stuff like that and he's cool! Now recently, because I knew he was trying to get into movies, I recommended American Psycho to him because it's a favorite movie of mine and I think it's a great satire on 80s Wall Street stuff. What follows isn't a JOKE and holy shit I wish it was.\n\nFlash forward to the next day and I meet up with him for lunch. He's wearing kind of formal clothing and I asked him if he had a class thing to dress up for and he said he just felt like it. I don't care and we go on with the day. I had no idea that was part one of his Patrick Bateman-ification.It's like for the next few days, he just TRANSFORMS. First I find out he's investing in stocks, and the next I find out he's trying to go to fancier bars to pick up girls and now he's eating at way fancier restaurants. He IS privileged income-wise, but he was NEVER like this. He's basically going on full suits everyday. And normally I wouldn't give a shit, but it's like he's started to see everything as second best, including me. He's been neglecting a lot of his hobbies, school stuff, and even friends that we mutually have.\n\nHe's been talking to me less which I didn't mind but when we do hang out, it's like he dismisses some of my comments or interrupts me a lot more mid-sentence and not on accident like usual. When he says bye to me it's like he's hurrying up to go away like I'm annoying him. His excuse to leave a lot of the time is he's checking on stocks and meeting up new girls or something.\n\nI eventually confront him about this not aggressively but I'm like \"Hey, you've changed it up a lot and I feel like it's caused a rift in our friendship\" and he then goes \"Patrick Bateman inspired me to become a better person and I don't think you're someone I should be friends with.\n\nI can't lie I go BERSERK telling him that he's just throwing away our friendship, and how he's not gotten his priorities straight, how and Patrick Bateman isn't even supposed to be a good guy! He's not Patrick Bateman and shouldn't be! Then he gets mad and storms off and keeps messaging me about how I was mean to him or whatever.\n\nNow I'm having second thoughts. Am I the asshole here?

American Psycho was supposed to be a commentary on the self-impressed, empty, and uncaring nature of Wall Street Finance Bros, not to hold them up as something to aspire to. If he didn't get that from the movie, he is not a very smart man.", "NTA - your friend is an idiot and you should be happy he is showing himself out. What kind of moron watches a movie literally has *PSYCHO* in the name as a reference to the protagonist and concludes that he is intended to be a role model? Especially when the guy then goes on a murderous rampage and is very obviously deeply mentally disturbed throughout the movie.", "For the love of god do not tell him about Andrew Tate!", "NTA - but seriously why do you care - he\u2019s shown you who he wants to be  and what he now thinks of you.

Bateman obsesses over symbols of his own status, including: the building he lives in, his job title, his glasses, his shoes, his abs, even his sophisticated taste in bottled water. He tries so hard to stand out, by doing a better job of blending in than everyone else. He parrots the news about how we need to solve the aids crisis, but clearly doesn't give a damn about other people. Even when he is engaged in the act of sex, he focuses more on how cool he looks in the mirror.\n\nAll of this is the shell of an identity, with no person inside it.\n\nHe's not just a bad person because of the murdery parts - which [spoiler] might not actually be happening, since his narration is not reliable.", "Does he know the rules for wearing a sweater vest?", "He doesn't have time for you.

If your friend thinks that Patrick Bateman is not only an engaging character but *one he wants to be like*, then you're not losing much of a friend. More like you're dodging a very grisly ending. \n\nBut more importantly, I can't stop laughing at the idea of someone who is trying to be cold and calculating like Patrick Bateman would then be insecure enough to keep messaging you about being mean to him. Like, I don't think the english language has the capacity to describe that level of cognitive dissonance. \n\nHe'll adopt the personality of whatever he sees next. And the next one. And the next one. Because your friend is clearly lost and searching. Maybe show him a movie where the main character is a likeable, good person so you can get some relief for a while.", "Okay the only thing I took from that is he doesn't think you are someone he should be friends with.\n\nFull stop.

NTA, but even if you were, he\u2019s being more of an AH. if he keeps this up, he\u2019ll be rudely awakened by his ignorance. no one should strive to be patrick bateman.", "Patrick could not connect with people, which is why Bale played him the way he did. He played him so that people would NOT like him, and see that he was odd. \n\nHe talked about music in a very empty way, with a script like exaggeration because he learned it to talk to people he wanted to chop in to pieces. \n\nThe only thing that film did was have a setting where people wore suits and have money, otherwise there was zero about it that was glamorized. \n\nEven when they went to fancy restaurants it was showing that it's just another restaurant. The movie gets better with age because as the styles look dated, people can see through what is happening more. \n\nSo it's bizarre what he's doing yes. \nNTA", " \"Patrick Bateman inspired me to become a better person and I don't think you're someone I should be friends with.\"  Listen to him.

I have no idea how someone walks away thinking Patrick Bateman should be emulated. I guess they're attracted to him? The two most famous scenes in that movie are Patrick Bateman droning on about an album review he read, and a scene where he has a silent, earth-shattering meltdown because he likes someone else's business card more than his own", "NTA - If he leaves and says he has to \"return some video tapes\" - RUN", "NTA. Wasn't Patrick Bateman a serial killer? Is he going to do that, too? If so, leave him alone.", "Who cares?  This guy was never a real friend anyway.

You either find out that they get that Patrick Bateman is a dweeb with delusions of self-importance and are therefore at least somewhat reasonable, functional adults, or that they think he's super cool and an inspiration, and are people you probably don't want to interact with.", "Fight Club is also in this category.
