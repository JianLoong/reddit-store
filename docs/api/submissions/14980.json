A few years ago, I remarried \u201cChris\u201d. We have a 6 month old baby girl together, \u201cLyla\u201d. Penelope and Jonny live primarily with their father as he\u2019s closer to their school. They come to us on the weekends.\n\nPenelope is in the theater program at her school. I missed the fall shows because I was in labor and then had a newborn. Penelope understood as best a preteen girl can.\n\nHer spring show opened last week. Chris and Lyla came with me. Will, Jonny and Will\u2019s wife \u201cAriana\u201d were already there. Will saw I brought Lyla and got a weird look about him but Ariana hushed him and said \u201cjust let it go\u201d.\n\nLyla slept through the first half. A little before intermission, she awoke and was fussy. I began rocking her and trying to calm her while also watching the play. I got a few dirty looks from parents around me. I gave them a \u201cwhat can you do\u201d shrug, as it\u2019s a baby.\n\nAt intermission, Will suggested Chris take Lyla home. I said she should sleep during the second half and Chris said he wanted to watch the performance. Will started getting upset but again, Ariana had him walk away. \n\nLyla did fall asleep again. But halfway through Act II, woke up and started screaming. It was loud enough this time that it did catch the performers off guard. I quickly went into the lobby with Lyla. When I tried to go back in once she calmed, the usher wouldn\u2019t let me, saying once a person leaves, they\u2019re not allowed in to prevent interruptions. Meaning, I missed Penelope\u2019s solo.\n\nPenelope refused to see me after the show nor accept the flowers we bought for her. I watched her leaving with Ariana, who was consoling her. Will met me in the parking lot. He was pissed. He said I never should\u2019ve brought Lyla, pointing out he and Ariana got a sitter for their young child. I said I didn\u2019t want to leave Lyla and felt it was good we all supported her. After missing the fall show, I wanted to be there for my daughter. I added it was just a middle school performance, it isn\u2019t the end of the world. He gave me a disgusted look and walks away.\n\nPenelope hasn\u2019t answered my calls or text. This weekend, she refused to come over. Chris thinks we were in the right, but my parents are just as pissed and called me an ass.

I added it was just a middle school performance, it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nYTA. Penelope did not feel 'good' or 'supported' that your infant with your new husband was so loud she distracted the actors and that ultimately, you ended up missing her solo to care for her. You should have gotten a sitter or at the absolute least taken her home when she started becoming distracting. It's also amazingly crappy to say it's not the end of the world that you ruined something so important to your daughter. You owe your daughter a massive apology for being selfish.", "YTA. First, Lyla is a baby and can\u2019t support anyone. You, however, are Penelope\u2019s mother and should do whatever you can to appropriately support her. Such as having the foresight to get a babysitter, or having your husband take charge of the screaming baby.\n\nSecond, it\u2019s just awful that you\u2019ve dismissed something so clearly important to Penelope as \u201cjust a middle school performance.\u201d At 12, a solo performance is likely one of the biggest moments of her life so far, and you ruined it.", "YTA performances like that are so important to young girls. I don't know why Chris couldn't take her Lyla home since this is your daughter's solo. It would have been best to have gotten a sitter for a couple of hours.", "YTA.  \n\n1)Babies don't belong at the theater -ever.  It is not a wedding or a family event, babies cry and should not be there.\n\n2) If the baby needed to be taken out, your husband, who was not the parent of one of the children in the play, should have taken the baby - not you.  Frankly the fact that he wasn't willing to stay home with the baby OR take the baby home when the baby started getting fussy OR be the one hold the baby so you could focus on your daughter's performance OR take the baby out gives me a huge amount of side eye and makes me think he isn't willing to put in any extra effort with the baby at all.", "Sorry OP,  you clearly burnt a bridge with your daughter. You should have had Chris take Lyla away, immediately, when she started to fuss. Why did YOU leave when you knew it something important to Penelope?\n\nAnd your dismissive attitude is hurtful. Wow, what a great way to diminish and demean a child's accomplishments...... It's a good thing Penelope isn't speaking to you atm, I can only imagine the type of apology-no-apology you'd give. \n\nGive you head a shake OP. YTA.", "YTA. 100% No one comes to a play to hear someone else's baby cry. You disrespected the efforts of the performers, disrupted the show, missed your daughter's solo, upset the other parents around you, upset the people you are meant to be co-parenting with, likely upset your own baby, etc. \n\nWhy would your daughter need or want the support of an infant who obviously would have no clue what's going on. That's bs you are telling yourself. You could have come alone. You could have gotten a sitter. You put your own feelings over your daughter, the work of the performers, and the other families who you interrupted there to see their own kids. I wouldn't come over anymore if I was your daughter. What's the point? You've proven exactly who and what your priorities are.", "Yes, YTA\n\nYou disturbed the whole show! You could have taken your baby outside. You could have gotten up & simply walked to the back of the room. Your husband could have taken the baby out, etc. You had many options & didn't do anything to alleviate the situation.", "YTA. Have you never heard of a freaking babysitter? This was a performance and not an appropriate place to bring a baby. You disrupted the event for everyone else in the audience, and still managed to let your daughter down.

You messed up big time OP, you showed your daughter that she is not as important as lyla.", "YTA \n\nThe baby was disturbing others. You should have left at intermission or sat outside. Or just got a babysitter for an infant instead of disturbing others.", "YTA, and good luck getting Penelope to come over again. You owe her a huge apology. Not only for being rude and not taking your baby out at the appropriate time, but for minimizing her event -- 'it's only a middle school performance'.  To her it was a really big deal and you should have treated it that way.  Chris should have taken the baby out at intermission or stayed home with her.  \n\nIt's not all about you two.", "YTA\n\nYour baby would have been fine at home with a baby sitter (or having your husband take her outside **as soon as she started to fuss )** but your 12 YO was well aware of her mom being the one who disrupted the show and missing her solo.\n\nIt's not \"just a middle school performance\" - for these kids, it's a huge deal. they've worked hard on this, they wanted to do a great job, and you messed that up for them.", "YTA\n\nI don't know if you knew you couldn't go back inside. I also think a babysitter would've been better or leaving during the intermission. \nWhat really makes me say YTA is this statement:\n\n\"I added it was just a middle school performance, it isn\u2019t the end of the world.\"\n\nIt is your daughter! \n(To add: whats up with the question? \"My baby\" to \"her sister's\"? It's your child not just the sister of your baby?)\nShe is 12. To her it was important. She wanted her Mom to see her on stage and you act like it's nothing. No wonder Will gave you a disgusted look.\nBtw a 6 M old can't \"support\" anyone.", "Yta\u2026.you should have left the baby with a babysitter.  You not only missed your daughter\u2019s solo but also disrupted the event for all the other attendees. You could have had your new husband take the baby out but no he had to watch the show too.  You were way too selfish and only thought about what was best for you.  I\u2019m glad Penelope\u2019s dad and step mom were there for her to console her.", "Yta and Chris should have walked out with the crying baby. It's a middle school show with a solo - AFTER you repeatedly showed Penelope you don't care about her. And ruined it for a bunch of other parents and kids. I hope you learn from this before you ruin your relationship with your son so you can salvage at least one. I wouldn't be shocked if Penelope wants nothing to do with you OR your do-over baby.", "YTA i don't see why Chris had to be there and couldn't stay home and watch your new baby, good job making your children think you like their new sibling better than them which it sounds like you do.", "YTA. You daughter is probably feeling like the baby is more important than her. Should have gotten a sitter or made your husband take her home. Your husband is also TA for not taking the baby himself so you could be present for your daughter.", "YTA Surely Chris could\u2019ve taken care of his daughter while you watched Penelope\u2019s performance. You disrupted other people\u2019s enjoyment of the performance unnecessarily.", "YTA! That is so inconsiderate. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re even asking.", "YTA - that night might not have meant much to you but it probably meant everything to your daughter and you didn't take measures to make sure it was a great night for her. You ruined it, humiliated her and you missed her big moment. This is seriously damaging for a child. You need to set time aside for your older children, yes babies need care, but you still have a duty to your daughter. If you don't fix this then please don't be shocked when you're not included in future events in her life.", "YTA. You should have arranged a sitter. \nYou knew how badly you needed to not fuck this up (since you were actually going to be there this time), and instead of planning ahead and not risking any issues, you interrupted the performance and missed it. Again.", "YTA - A 6 month old baby crying loudly and suddenly is an expected event. Literally the trope of baby in a theater crying during the performance. You had time to plan out how to avoid letting down your other daughter and instead of 1, hiring a babysitter, 2, having a relative sit for you if you're not comfortable with a 'stranger', or 3, have your husband, who is not your older daughter's father, stay home and watch the baby\n\nPenelope would not have cared if her stepfather had missed her solo to care for the baby but her mom? yeah you fucked up and showed your daughter that even if she gives you time to get your ducks in a row, you will not come through for her. Why didn't Chris take the baby out when she was crying? It wasn't his daughter's solo that was happening soon.\n\nYou not only let down your daughter through entirely preventable actions, but you minimized the hurt you caused because you couldn't own that your selfishness in not wanting to be without your infant daughter for even 2 hours meant that you would choose to hurt Penelope rather than take any steps that would require any effort. Your ex husband hired a sitter for his young kid, there is a clear and immediate example of how not to show your older kid that their bright and shiny half sibling is more important than them.\n\nYour daughter already doesn't live with you 5/7th of the week, you just showed that she will never be a priority to you over your new 'family'. Own up to your shitty treatment of your older children before this no contact continues into a permanent thing and you're left wondering why your adult children don't ever answer your calls or speak to you anymore", "I feel so sad for Penelope. At least her dad and step mom seem to care about her.", "Try this on Broadway or the Opera etc, see what happens.", "YTA Just a middle school performance and it wasn't a big deal? Well it was a big deal to your daughter. If it wasn't that big of a deal then did you bother going at all? You should have gotten a sitter for your baby a shown your daughter a better support.", "YTA, but honestly, I think Chris is the bigger one. \nLook, babies are notorious for crying. When they do so, they disrupt the play. You should have gotten a sitter. But since you didn't, it should have been Chris to take Lyla out.\n\nStepparents can be very important in a person's life, can even be as important as a parent. But the fact is that you are Penelope's mom. You've been in her life 12 years, Chris only a few. She wanted you to see her performance. She didn't care if Chris was tok engrossed to leave. She wanted her mom.\n\nThis likely isn't something irreparable if you keep trying to apologize and make it up to Penelope. See if you can arrange a special time out just the two of you. And make sure you're at the future performances as well as you can be. If you can't get a sitter, have Chris stay home or impress on him that he needs to take Lyla out of the theater.", "YTA. And so is your new husband. You\u2019re obviously so in to your new baby and new life, that you don\u2019t care how you\u2019re impacting your eldest daughter. She wanted her mom there, and you couldn\u2019t hire a sitter for one evening because YOU wanted your baby and new husband there. You need to seriously reconsider your actions, and apologize to your daughter. Otherwise, I suspect this to be the start of your new life of having only one daughter, your baby.", "YTA\n\nIf you wanted to come, you should have arranged for a sitter for Lyla. Everything would have been fine had you done that. This was on you.", "YTA.\n\nIf you really didn\u2019t want to get a sitter and be there as a big family, Chris should\u2019ve had the baby and been prepared to leave if she got loud. \n\nThe performance was likely primarily for you considering you missed the last one (not your fault)  but then you went and missed this one. Penelope had every right to be pissed.\n\nAlso, are you only going to start taking accomplishments after middle school seriously? Because \u201cit\u2019s only middle school\u201d sounds like a lie  you told yourself because you know you fucked up.", "YTA. \n\nBut props to Ariana for being a great partner and stepmother. She saw your ex getting upset and intervened SEVERAL times giving you a chance to right your wrong and you didn\u2019t even when directly confronted and she comforted your daughter got your mistake. Also, she put her step daughter\u2019s performance first and they got a sitter. \n\nShe sounds great.", "YTA for sure. Your daughters (and I am confident both feel this) rightfully feel that they are not your priority. They stay with Dad because you don\u2019t live close enough to the school to share equal time? Move closer to the school. You don\u2019t ask your husband to miss part of a riveting middle school performance so you could see her solo? YTA. You owe her a huge apology and some serious life changes or you will lose them both", "YTA. You\u2019re obviously lost in the midst of having another baby but it doesn\u2019t excuse continuing to alienate your existing kids. They rarely come over and so you also rarely have to take care of them, but all you had to do this time was show up and pay attention and you didn\u2019t. Obviously it was something important to her that her father and step mother realized and supported.", "YTA for everything everyone else has listed, but I want to point out that your headline is also SHIT because you make it sound like you're not even Penelope's mother. Her sister's performance? How about YOUR OLDER DAUGHTER'S performance? You really are a piece of work.", "YTA. Let me make this perfectly clear. *You in no way, shape or form supported Penelope*. Nothing about your \"support\" was good. To Penelope you are the awful parent that all of her friends are complaining about, the one who ruined the show *for every other adult and child present*.\n\nYour new baby is not special. Your new baby is not worth more than your other children, and is *certainly* not worth more than the children of *other people* that you completely disrespected. At the very least, when Lyla proved to be unable to stay silent, Chris should have sat outside with her. Are you so completely divorced from reality that you didn't realise that the performance would probably *wake* the baby? Or are you so focused on *you* and what *you want* that you couldn't take a moment to consider what was right for Penelope AND Lyla.\n\nCongratulations. You've just taught Penelope that the baby is more important and that you don't even care about her enough to understand why you completely failed her. I'm glad she has Will and Ariana.", "YTA\u2014 to Penelope it wasn\u2019t just a middle school performance. You definitely could have gotten a sitter for a couple hours or Chris should have been the one to step out with the baby so you didn\u2019t miss your daughter\u2019s performance. She would have preferred you to see it and not her stepfather.", "YTA you weren\u2019t there for your daughter and dismissing it as a middle school performance really shows why YTA for you it\u2019s a small thing for her this is the biggest thing she\u2019s done yet and you missed it AGAIN for your new baby AGAIN", "YTA I have older children & also younger children & a second marriage & at times of performance , my husband has either watched the youngest  children or we have gotten a sister as babies are unpredictable and yea they do cry , you were inconsiderate to the other parents in the audience who were there to watch their children ( what can you do?

That was the final straw for me.\n\nNot that there weren't plenty of straws before that.

Don\u2019t bring a baby into a theater.\n\nIf you are egotistical enough to do so anyway, at least have the courtesy to Leave if the baby begins crying or screaming.\n\nI\u2019ll bet you anything that normally people Are allowed in again, after going to the toilet, but because of how often and how thoroughly the baby had disrupted the show You we\u2019re not allowed in again.  Which was a good and fair decision on the ushers part, give that person a raise. \n\nNobody can blame Penelope for not wanting to speak with you now.\n\nYou chose the baby over her on Her evening. \n\nAnd you can bet it won\u2019t take long before everyone knows Who brought the baby and ruined parts of the show, meaning Penelope will undoubtedly have to deal with her school mates comments about it. \n\nAll you had to do was place Penelope before your wants for a few hours and get a sitter or have your husband stay home with the kid.\n\nAt the very least your husband should have been the one taking the baby out of the theater as it wasn\u2019t his kid on stage.", "YTA. I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt but you made like 10 wrong turns and then doubled down by dismissing your daughter's feelings. \n\nThis coparenting schedule already puts you at a disadvantage. Coparenting with school age kids is so hard because you have to do what's best for them and their education, and I don't fault you for doing that.\n\nBUT when you have this schedule where you only see your daughter two days a week, you have to be *all in* those two days, and for other things that come up like performances. I know it's hard with a young baby but, respectfully, you chose to have another child. You have to find a way to manage this or it's going to really affect your relationship with your daughter.\n\nI'm not sure if you have PPD/PPA, but you're going to have to start being away from Lyla to be 100% present for Penelope (and probably Jonny) when you need to, in situations like this. It's a couple days a week and an evening here or there- that is not too much for your older children to expect. Your new husband is a father now, and it's time for him to act like it. He should be the primary and default parent for Lyla as much as possible when your older kids are with you because of your schedule. I understand that things like breastfeeding might complicate that, but you should really make it a goal that unless absolutely necessary, your older kids are the priority to YOU (Lyla has another parent, she's ok) when they are over/at their events.", "Well thank god Chris got to see her solo. /s \n\nYTA.", "Are you really asking?

You have yet to express one iota of remorse.\n\nAnd the final indignity to this is that you dismissed your daughter's performance as a mere middle school performance and not the end of the world--WAY to tell your daughter that she is worthless in your mind.  \n\nHope you really enjoy that second family(Chris & Lyla) because you have done little to promote a positive/healthy relationship with Penelope(and I would wager with Jonny either).", "YTA\n\n>I said I didn\u2019t want to leave Lyla and felt it was good we all supported her.\n\nNope.

I'm guessing by your title that you don't. It's very telling that you refer to Penelope as your baby's sister. \n\nDon't be surprised when Penelope doesn't invite you to her events.

Penelope is not just pissed, she is pribably mortified. Why on earth would you think bringing the baby was remotely a good idea?! You have a lot of making up to do.

Of course the step dad doesn\u2019t think you did anything wrong he\u2019s part of the problem with not letting you just spend time with your child!!!!

A few years ago, I remarried \u201cChris\u201d. We have a 6 month old baby girl together, \u201cLyla\u201d. Penelope and Jonny live primarily with their father as he\u2019s closer to their school. They come to us on the weekends.\n\nPenelope is in the theater program at her school. I missed the fall shows because I was in labor and then had a newborn. Penelope understood as best a preteen girl can.\n\nHer spring show opened last week. Chris and Lyla came with me. Will, Jonny and Will\u2019s wife \u201cAriana\u201d were already there. Will saw I brought Lyla and got a weird look about him but Ariana hushed him and said \u201cjust let it go\u201d.\n\nLyla slept through the first half. A little before intermission, she awoke and was fussy. I began rocking her and trying to calm her while also watching the play. I got a few dirty looks from parents around me. I gave them a \u201cwhat can you do\u201d shrug, as it\u2019s a baby.\n\nAt intermission, Will suggested Chris take Lyla home. I said she should sleep during the second half and Chris said he wanted to watch the performance. Will started getting upset but again, Ariana had him walk away. \n\nLyla did fall asleep again. But halfway through Act II, woke up and started screaming. It was loud enough this time that it did catch the performers off guard. I quickly went into the lobby with Lyla. When I tried to go back in once she calmed, the usher wouldn\u2019t let me, saying once a person leaves, they\u2019re not allowed in to prevent interruptions. Meaning, I missed Penelope\u2019s solo.\n\nPenelope refused to see me after the show nor accept the flowers we bought for her. I watched her leaving with Ariana, who was consoling her. Will met me in the parking lot. He was pissed. He said I never should\u2019ve brought Lyla, pointing out he and Ariana got a sitter for their young child. I said I didn\u2019t want to leave Lyla and felt it was good we all supported her. After missing the fall show, I wanted to be there for my daughter. I added it was just a middle school performance, it isn\u2019t the end of the world. He gave me a disgusted look and walks away.\n\nPenelope hasn\u2019t answered my calls or text. This weekend, she refused to come over. Chris thinks we were in the right, but my parents are just as pissed and called me an ass. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The baby should have been with some kind of sitter. No sitter? Husband should have taken the baby out to calm down because her kid in this performance is important (except she doesn't seem to think so...) If the husband IS a problem, that just points back to her being the problem as well.

Instead of having the stepfather of the play daughter take the infant daughter out, OP justified him staying because 'oh this is a great opportunity to bond' ignoring that she refused to do the bare minimum to put her older daughter first and would negate both her achievement and her feelings when called out for her shitty behavior.

I don't think it's on him from what we've read.  I think the *best* explanation is that OP is suffering from postpartum in some fashion.

At least bio dad and stepmother care, I guess.", "Lol, that's nuts. I at least thought maybe he's a hands-off dad who thinks watching his own kid counts as babysitting, so he doesn't know how to deal with a crying baby... This got so much worse.", "Both of them are.\n\nAnd the stepmom rocks. She did her best not to have a scene erupt so as to not ruin the performance. Too bad OP is not as considerate as the stepmom.", "Why are you calling her husband unemployed when she clearly stated he is a stay at home dad?  Are you suggesting every woman who stays home with kids is also \"unemployed\"?", "I really tried to give this lady every possible benefit of the doubt and she\u2019s just\u2026 not a great mother sorry to say.", "They are unemployed. They may do a shit ton of work and have a shit ton of responsibility, but that doesn't mean they're employed.", "Oh, miss me with that virtue signaling bullshit. The point is that he clearly had no other obligations and OP could have asked him to stay home with the baby. A theatre is obviously not an appropriate setting for an infant."]}
