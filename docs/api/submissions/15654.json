That's normally something you would say if someone said something about *you*, and you responded in a tit-for-tat. \"You said something that hurt me, so I said something that hurt you,\" kind of thing.\n\nWhat I get from that is that, despite what you think of this character, your GF apparently find the character relatable enough that she took offense.

You express a run-of-the-mill opinion on dating a character who is at a cross roads in her dating life. Sure, far too often guys can boil down thoughts about a woman's worth to whether she is datable (or, let's be honest, if she's f\\*\\*\\*\\*able). And I can understand how a woman could read the situation that way and be irritated.\n\nBut.\n\nIf that's the case, she should express that.

Instead, she goes right to a hurtful comment, deliberately lashing out at you. That is never cool. If the genders were reversed in your story, I think a lot of people would be calling a man out for what is often a first step in a pattern of abuse. \n\nThen, she refuses to engage further, to tell you specifically what caused her reaction. That's another red flag, a tool used to throw someone off, and make them walk on eggshells and second guessing themselves because they don't know what will set their partner off in the future. Again, this is a classic technique of abusers to put doubt/confusion in the minds of those they abuse.\n\nIf she subtly does things that put you down, or making you walk on tiptoes around her, I'd be careful--abusers don't start off abusing at full force.

But they are all horrible people LMAO", "Okay I agree with the fact that some women do definitely get knee-jerk defensive over insults to other women, but mumsnet isn\u2019t merely a women\u2019s forum: it\u2019s a forum in particular for transphobic women (aka colloquially as trans exclusive radical feminists, or TERFs) and misandrists.

Best wishes for you!", "I feel like she has thought about this before, or she wouldn't have told you something like that... maybe I'm wrong (and I hope I am), but I'd start thinking that this is a problem for her and that in the future, she'll start pointing out your economic differences.", "Oh i see. Good to know!", "Made her feel attacked, Howe? Is she secretly Olivia and you didn't know?

I've heard several  women get defensive and play the misgyony card and there are too many women these days I know who think it's acceptable to go on rants against males like its acceptable.

But cool.", "Why wouldn't it be relevant? We are meant to have feelings about and engage with the shows we are watching and the characters in them. \n\nOP is allowed to have opinions about the media he consumes and draw conclusions about his real life standards from the media he consumes. That's kinda the point of engaging with a story.", "Thank you! Her family loves me to death and they are amazing people and so is she.

Why are you so unnecessary rude?", "Way to put this on op. The gf basically said if i could pull better than you i would. What a shitty fucking thing to say to your partner.

You blaming op is like twice as bad.", "If she identifies with the problematic character, doesn\u2019t that make her the problematic character?

She probably didn\u2019t mean to hurt you. But in the context of how a lot of women have been brought up, this comment is DEEPLY disturbing (at least to me). There\u2019s a high chance I\u2019d react similarly (even if I agreed that the character is awful - idk I haven\u2019t watched Scandal). It\u2019s an AH reaction though, nothing to be proud of, and I mean what I wrote as an explanation, not an excuse (hence ESH and not Y-T-A).", "[removed]", "NTA but I don\u2019t think she was either just an error imo.

Personally, I like Olivia, but not like dating-her like. :) Poor Jake.", "NTA and the only reason she would feel \"attacked\" for your comment is if she felt she was similar to the character with a shitty personality. It is not an immediate reason to break up, but it is a pretty big red flag that she would tell you that you're not good enough to be with someone who has a high standing in society", "NTA but neither is she. A lot of people identify with characters in shows as I wish that could be me. Olivia is successful, strong, badass, dressed to the nines, intelligent all things to aspire to be. But has some huge huge flaws obviously like anyone else.\n\n\nIn general I'd advise against ever saying \"I'd never date....\" that part alone is enough to be taken as you expect the relationship to end and are already imagining the standards you'd have for dating someone else, which hurts. Even if not intended that way I could easily see it taken that way. I think this was probably the trigger tbh and why she said well I wouldn't date you either.\n\nSo my opinion, avoid saying I'd never date xyz because abc. Also (not that you did) I'd avoid saying \"I'm so glad you're not like so and so\" because it can be read as saying if you share any of these human flaws I wouldn't be with you.

I have no doubt she'll dump you as soon as she finds a man she thinks is superior.\n\nIf my girlfriend ever said something like this I would be incredibly insulted and hurt.

I think you need to re-evaluate this relationship.", "Nta that\u2019s a weird gf tho", "Nta", "NTA the initial \"if I was her ...\" comment was harsh but fairly reasonable, adding \"that stings doesn't it?\" seems spiteful and mean, as if she was trying to hurt you", "It's not something to break up over. However, the two things she was telling you, (If I could be in that position, you would not be worthy of being my partner, and that she's willing to add to the comment in order to hurt you) are things to keep in mind. It could be a sign of how she really sees you and something to watch for.", "If he were attracted to men, he probably would.\n\nIve seen both my sisters talk about dating male characters from shows", "Boss but horrible person", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It was the first time a black woman had been the lead of a broadcast drama since 1974, and it was the first show created by a black woman, starting a black woman, and directed by a black woman.\n\nIt's gotten a lot of unnecessary and unfounded hate simply because people didn't like having a black woman on TV, and direct a lot of micro aggressions to her character & Kerry Washington.\n\nIf OP's girlfriend is a WOC, I can understand being protective of the show & Olivia because it was groundbreaking for the time.

They are entertaining characters but I don\u2019t identify with them.\n\nLet\u2019s say I was watching succession and I said I\u2019d never want to date Kendall Roy because he\u2019s an awful person. If my parter said he wouldn\u2019t want to date me either for any number of reasons (not a hot model, not from a wealthy family) I wouldn\u2019t take that as a slight. \n\nI think she meant it stings because yes you might be turned down by an awful person, not because she doesn\u2019t see you as worthy", "I disagree, you are free to have feelings, however, we can argue that a feeling can come from misguided thoughts. Giving them validation only enforceses that they should hold any merit.", "My SO and I have a really similar dynamic and it can lead to a ton of miscommunication. I'm the classic \"bottle it up until you either explode or drop dead of a stroke\" type; he's the sort of person who speaks his mind 100% of the time. So I stay quiet about little things and by the time I say something, it's *really* important, but he hears it as the sort of low-level meaningless comment he might make about something trivial and doesn't take it seriously enough. And then I end up taking everything he says way *too* seriously (because from my perspective, you wouldn't say something if it wasn't critically important, right?). It's definitely a good thing to be aware of in this sort of argument (though I don't have a fix)."]}
