How we choose to act on those feelings may not be valid though.", "Depends on the situation, I wouldn't say a murders feelings are valid after they killed a family for no reason.", "I agree, it's something I noticed from several comments. It's something I didn't consider and is deffo my bad.", "Bingo.", "This is a great insight.", "Haha well that were the only 2 times. Just hope it stays with that. Thanks for being a kind stranger!", "Perhaps! In general she isn't too fond of other men and their behaviour, but she doesnt have any strong dislikes etc. I just hope it doesnt happen again tbh haha", "We talked, she doesn't really love talking about her feelings so she didn't really go into it. I do find it important so I told her what hurt me and said sorry for making her feel that way.", "Sorry dude, didn\u2019t mean to sound harsh.  You seem like a good guy, I\u2019d say just be cautious moving forward.  Her attitude is fairly alarming and reeks of disrespect.", "She is objectively an awful person as are a majority of characters in that show. Idg the big deal in admitting some characters are awful.", "No she breaks up with a person in the senate because she rather hides (ex)her relationship with a married man.", "Ok, but again, a) how would she know, and b) practically speaking, would she be right?\n\nLets say she was whatever, a politico, heiress, whatever.  How would you two have met?  Probably not however you met in reality.", "\ud83d\udea9", "That's a bad sign. If it was you not liking other women and their behaviour I'd imagine she wouldn't accept that but it's fine for her to do it herself. Watch now the next time you disagree with her over something or have your own opinion that is different to hers and she'll gaslight you with the white male privelge card.\n\nStand your ground there mate. Don't be bullied, if you are white there's nothing you can do about it and it's not your fault some (far from all )other white men get some of the best privelge.", "Thanks for looking out! It's the second time this happened in like a year and first time I talk to her about it. Normally she respects me and is wonderfull.", "Haven\u2019t seen the show, but if they really broke up because the bf cheated on her, while OP says it\u2019s just because of her \u2018awful personality\u2019 I could see why gf takes an issue with her. Especially in the context of the character\u2019s boyfriend being a cheater, it might look like OP is justifying his cheating to her.", "I get your point and it's deffo valid!\n\nIn case ur interested we met when we were both on holiday. So a random encounter!", "Haha don't worry. I deffo stand my ground in discussions and disagreements. I am half white so I can't fully fall under those things.", "She\u2019s like a political fixer and she\u2019s having an affair with the president of the United States, they are both cheaters. She does a lot more than just cheating lol (can\u2019t go into it without spoilers). Google things Olivia pope has done for a quick summary if you care to", "What the person said is not accurate. She and the bf broke up because she was trying to hide the fact she had an affair with the president who also was married and had a wife. She broke up other relationships with lies etc and is in general a corrupt politician and much more", "Well the fact you're a man will still put you under the grill with her I assume. If you're white and male it's white male privilege you get accused of to silence you, if you are other but still got a penis then it's just male privelge. Many people actually totally misunderstand of what these words actually mean."]}
