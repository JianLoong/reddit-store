Definitely set some rules for dining and table manners, just as you would for a child, including that the ends have to be consumed before the middle.  He does not even offer to share the middle with you, so consider removing the middle 2\u201c and making it unavailable to him so only the delicious smelling, tantalizing end portions are left for public consumption.
