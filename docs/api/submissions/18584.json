I\u2019ve known Carrie for nearly 20 years and Marco probably about 12 or 13 years. They\u2019ve started dating earlier this year, and all of our friends are happy for them. They both are good people and to see them together and happy is wonderful. \n\nThe issue I\u2019ve run into is their excessive PDA. I went to coffee with Carrie and another friend when Marco stopped by to pick up her car and they started making out at the table. Lots of embracing, giggling, open mouth kissing, etc.\n\nMy chair was directly facing Carrie so I repositioned myself so I could face my friend and continue the conversation we were having. 10 minutes later, Marco gets up, waves at us and leaves. Carrie just smiles and says \u201cwhere were we?\u201d\n\nThis has happened at every friend gathering where both are present. Much like the coffee incident, I pivot my position so I can focus my attention on whomever I\u2019m speaking to. \n\nWhere I might be TA is in regard to Carrie\u2019s birthday. She\u2019s having an intimate dinner, inviting a couple of friends, me, and of course Marco. When she asked if I was coming, I told her I had to decline, but I would love to take her to dinner soon. She asked if I had a conflict. I said I did not, and she asked why things had changed. I asked if we could FaceTime so we could talk face to face and she called me. \n\nI told her that I love spending time with her, and I\u2019m so happy for her and Marco, but that I get uncomfortable with excessive PDA. Every time we\u2019ve hung out together, they\u2019ve gotten into at least one 5+ min makeout session and I\u2019d prefer not to upset her on her birthday by often repositioning myself/exiting the room. \n\nCarrie said I\u2019m jealous because I\u2019m single and that if I can\u2019t be happy for her, then we may have to rethink our friendship. \n\nI told her that PDA makes me uncomfortable in general and it\u2019s not specific to her and Marco at all. I referenced other friends where I\u2019ve turned when they\u2019re giving a goodbye kiss, etc. I referenced former relationships where I\u2019ve kept displays of affection to a minimum, only kissing a boyfriend in public when it was New Year\u2019s. \n\nCarrie said then the PDA issue is my problem to deal with and I said yes, of course it is my problem. Which is why I declined her invite. She hung up and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. \n\nMarco texted and said I upset Carrie and that I should patch things up with her. I said that I would do my best but it wouldn\u2019t lessen my discomfort with 30-40somethings making out like teenagers. He simply sent a shrug emoji. \n\nSome of our friends have agreed that the PDA is too much but have said that I should\u2019ve just gone along with Carrie\u2019s birthday and had the conversation later, when there wasn\u2019t already an event on the horizon. \n\nAITA for declining Carrie\u2019s invite to her birthday?", "created_utc": 1685476626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0ccn/aita_for_declining_an_invite_due_to_my_friends/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At the very least not *every* hangout.", "NTA - handled perfectly, no notes.", "NTA It is absolutely your right not to put yourself into situations that make you uncomfortable.

Then you have the people that *want* people to see.", "Making out in front of people after you turn probably 16 is incredibly tacky (at least in the US, different strokes for different cultures and all).  It just makes you look lame and trashy.  If you are an adult presumably you have places to do these sort of things in privacy.  If you don't, at least go to a movie theater and sit in the back or something.", "NTA how old is she??? 5+ minute makeout session while surrounded by friends trying to have a good time is excessive. you politely declined and she acted like a teenager (fitting) by being irrational and blaming you\n\nI don\u2019t understand why some people have such a problem with a person taking themselves out of a situation they are uncomfortable with. by all means, PDA it up at your birthday!

Don't understand how it's hard for 30 and 40 year olds to not have a 5+ minute makeout session but as Marco said '\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f'", "Honestly I think you handled a not so graceful situation with grace. It sounds like she was a little defensive because she doesn't want to change behavior but also doesn't want her friends to distance themselves from her and your conversation made it clear that's a choice she'll have to make... Especially if other friends have been feeling the same even if they didn't bring it up yet.\n\nNTA, bordering N A H but the story you shared of the cafe makes it sound like, regardless of PDA factor, she recognizes she's kinda just ignoring her friends suddenly and entirely whenever bf enters the room until he leaves, including at hangouts he's not a part of, and expects folks to just go along with it... Which kinda sucks", "NTA - I am 42yo and I wouldn\u2019t put it with it. It\u2019s just too much.", "LOL NTA. My best friend is the exact same way and then questions why I don't like to be the 3rd wheel.", "NTA.

It sounds like they're being extremely rude, but if you can't handle a quick kiss goodbye without getting uncomfortable and only think that you can kiss your SO in public when it's New Years, it sounds like your standards are pretty unreasonable.", "I\u2019m sure if you guys sit down to talk again, and listen to each other with an open mind, there is probably a compromise that could be reached. The puppy love phase of their relationship won\u2019t last nearly as long as your guys\u2019 relationship has, so maybe grit your teeth and bare it in the meantime. There will always be things that people do that bother someone else, but a mature person learns to deal with things that make them uncomfortable. Hope you guys work it out", "INFO\n\nWhy y'all hang around an old dude like Marco?\n\n> I\u2019ve known Carrie for nearly 20 years and Marco probably about 12 or 13 years. \n\nSo he was in his mid-30s hanging out with just-barely 20yos?", "NTA. You were respectful and clear about your personal boundaries, and quietly removed yourself from a situation you knew you would find uncomfortable. You didn\u2019t make a big fuss about the PDA or demand that Mark and Carrie change their behaviour; you didn\u2019t even *mention* it until she pushed, and then you explained it as gently and carefully as you could. Plus, while constantly declining invitations will inevitably lead to a change in relationships over time, no one is actually obliged to *accept* an invitation if they don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not a legal obligation. Carrie had no right to be so demanding about this, or to start throwing around unkind remarks about you being jealous because you happen to be single.", "NTA. I think you stated your boundaries very clearly. You didn't ask them to stop, you just made it clear that you didn't want to be around to watch their make out sessions. Good on you for handling this very maturely. :-)", "NTA. You marked your boundary and the decent and guts to explain your position. Further, you owned that it's \"your problem,\" and, hence why you are removing yourself from her special day. I actually your actions admirable and wish more people were straightforward.\n\nI hope things can be patched up.", "Absolutely not. NTA.\n\nIt's awkward! It's not even (entirely) the level of physical intimacy IMO, it's emotional intimacy/abrupt cutting out of the conversation. What are you supposed to *do* when people, mid-conversation, suddenly start focusing super hard on each other? \n\nI had friends who didn't make out, but did at the drop of the hat start being super snuggly in a way that made continuing conversation impossible. It's like, seriously, what are you expecting me to do when that happens? It's rude to stare. Lucky I have a phone, haha.", "Nta - you did the adult thing and politely removed yourself from a situation that made you uncomfortable, when asked, you again politely told her the truth. But she then had to turn it around and insult you and expect you to do something that made you feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m sorry. NTA", "I certainly don\u2019t understand it, but I have tried to chalk it up to the honeymoon phase of the relationship\u2026but it\u2019s been going on nearly 6 months now, so who knows??", "Right? They\u2019re acting like they\u2019re in line at an amusement park.", ">but if you can't handle a quick kiss goodbye without getting uncomfortable and only think that you can kiss your SO in public when it's New Years\n\n\n\nBut what you said isn't at all what Op said. It isn't anything quick.\n\nRead again", "I appreciate this take, thank you! I have reached out to Carrie asking if she and I can sit down in person and talk this out.", "Carrie and I were in the same book club as Marco right when she was graduating college. The romantic interest between the two of them didn\u2019t develop until late last year I guess.", "Maybe they are exhibitionists and people being there heightens the experience. No one should ever be required to participate in a friend\u2019s kink. Just speculating but definitely NTA", "She\u2019s upset with you because she knows her behavior with Marco is over the top.  You told her about her and Marco\u2019s behavior making you uncomfortable in a mature, un confrontational manner.  You called her out, she\u2019s embarrassed and blocked you.  If she actually didn\u2019t take to heart what you said, she wouldn\u2019t have said anything to Marco.  You\u2019re right about the honeymoon phase.  When it ends, which we all know it will, she\u2019ll probably rethink her rash decision about your comments and contact you.  20 years is a long friendship to dissolve over making out in front of friends.", "Maybe she's insecure in her relationship and needs others validation.", ">I referenced other friends where I\u2019ve turned when they\u2019re giving a goodbye kiss, etc. I referenced former relationships where I\u2019ve kept displays of affection to a minimum, only kissing a boyfriend in public when it was New Year\u2019s. \n\nThese are other friends kissing goodbye, who presumably have normal boundaries around PDA.", "You nailed it!", "NTA\n\nPDA is one thing. Being front row half a meter away when those you are having a conversation with delve into a 5 minute facial foreplay is completely different. I've had the misfortune of being in this exact situation myself and it was so awkward it was insane. Like. If you want to make out, please don't do it in the middle of conversation and right in my face?? Should be common sense!", "NTA.\n\nI'm also not comfortable with excessive pda and look away/remove myself. I don't expect anyone to do anything different, neither did you.", "NTA\u2026 but also that is not your friend\u2026 the fact that she immediately called you jealous\u2026  uh huh your friend is probably over compensating for something. \nAlso, wouldn\u2019t be surprised if her other friends declined for the same reason.", "Gross, I wouldn\u2019t want to be around that and I\u2019m someone who is fine with (reasonable) PDA. I can\u2019t even imagine standing there while someone is french kissing and full on making out for literally minutes. What the hell. If I can see and hear your gross wet tongues slobbering all over I\u2019m out of there. NTA", "NTA, i\u2019m the same way. i hate any PDA, i will not go anywhere if i know i\u2019ll be around a bunch of couples cause it\u2019s bound to happen, especially at a birthday party", "NTA\n\nYou handled this perfectly. Not wanting to watch a make out session doesn\u2019t make you jealous.\n\nHonestly if I didn\u2019t know your ages, I\u2019d think she\u2019s 16 and it\u2019s her first bf. \n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong and handled this whole thing with kindness and respect. \n\nShe and Marco can do their exhibitionist kink stuff in front of someone else lol", "Soft YTA. I am not a fan of excessive PDA like that either, but you should have said something to Carrie way sooner or waited until after her bday. Like of course it\u2019s going to hurt her feelings when you are one of few people that she wants to celebrate with and you avoid her for something so small. Only thing ah here is that you put your foot down for her bday rather than addressing it at a different time tho. Like I would def just say something about it at a less important time.", "NTA.\n\nYou established a boundary and instead of agreeing not to do PDA with Marco, she insists that you just deal with it? If I was Carrie, I would feel awful for making you uncomfortable and this would be a wake-up call for me. It's immature for both of them. Good for you for sticking up for yourself, OP.", "And even teenagers have an expectation not to PDA in spaces where it would be inappropriate.", "Yeah, when our friends have said similar, they\u2019ve just upped the intensity of their makeout session. Most of our friends just similarly pivot away from the affectionate couple so we can continue chatting about whatever we were talking about previously.", "Yeah, I think our FaceTime call was the first time someone had called out that it happens literally every time they\u2019re together with friends and it took her by surprise. I do wonder if the conversation is making her think about how often this is happening when she\u2019s actively in conversation with her friends.", "I think Carrie was in shock that I declined her invite because I usually pencil in her birthday every year and make sure I\u2019m available if she wants to go out. I\u2019ve rarely, if ever, declined an invite from Carrie, especially if it\u2019s her birthday so I think it took her off guard.", "Right! I really don\u2019t need or want a front row seat to their affection. I have no qualms with them being affectionate, (they\u2019re in a relationship, of course I expect them to be lovey dovey) but when I\u2019m having a conversation with Carrie and Marco comes over and starts kissing her, it makes it awkward.", "Because age isn't an issue for mature adults. Hang with who you want. If you don't like it, remove yourself from the conversation like the OP did to marco and carrie.", "I wouldn\u2019t call them standards. I don\u2019t have any expectation of my friends to act a certain way. I do turn away because I personally don\u2019t want or need to sit and watch as my friends are affectionate with their SO. \n\nAnd it\u2019s not that I think I\u2019m only allowed to kiss a SO in public during a holiday, I just personally rarely do it. Again people do what they want and I personally don\u2019t want to watch lots of PDA. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m scandalized if I catch a friend kissing their SO. I just often turn away to give them privacy.", "I mean, that\u2019s fair, and that is where I thought I could be the AH is because of her birthday. One of the first gatherings we had after they started dating, one of our friends shouted \u201chey you two, come up for air once in awhile!\u201d when they first started doing this, but it only made them increase their intensity. I actually pulled Marco aside at the end of that event and said \u201chey, maybe you two can cool it on the PDA next time, just a notch, or go into the back bedroom if you need some alone time?\u201d He just laughed and said \u201cwe\u2019re happy, what\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d", "I mean, needing to turn away to visibly display your discomfort and/or disgust when your friends show affection like normal human beings just seems kind of uncomfortable and sad. \n\nI guess it's not strictly asshole behavior, but it's making things way more awkward than it needs to be.  Sometimes people who like each other will briefly display affection for each other in public.  You don't need to turn away like they're doing something dirty.", "To be completely fair to her, she (normally) doesn\u2019t initiate these encounters and when she\u2019s dated men in the past, she has not been like this and I\u2019ve known her since we were teens. This seems like a new thing with Marco, and something he particularly likes to initiate. So I realize she may have been defensive of her SO in our conversation, but I\u2019m hoping we can work together on a compromise.\n\nETA: fixed a typo to clarify that Carrie has not been like this in her past relationships.", "I guess you and I just see things differently. I don\u2019t make things awkward. It\u2019s just like discreetly turning to someone else or going to the host to help with dishes and clean up. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sitting there making a scene by moaning and groaning that they\u2019re kissing. \n\nMy friends don\u2019t notice I\u2019m doing that. None of my friends even recognized that I was uncomfortable with Carrie & Marco\u2019s PDA until Carrie texted them after the fact.\n\nAgain, if I catch someone kissing, oh well, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s not something dirty, it\u2019s a sign of affection between two partners. I don\u2019t even think Carrie and Marco\u2019s PDA is dirty, it\u2019s just more excessive than anything. \n\nI mean if my friends would prefer me to sit there and watch them lock lips, I certainly can do that, but most of my friends are discreet with that stuff and I am as well. \n\nBut sure, call me uncomfortable and sad because you don\u2019t understand my preference to give my friends privacy during their affectionate moments."]}
