I\u2019ve known Carrie for nearly 20 years and Marco probably about 12 or 13 years. They\u2019ve started dating earlier this year, and all of our friends are happy for them. They both are good people and to see them together and happy is wonderful. \n\nThe issue I\u2019ve run into is their excessive PDA. I went to coffee with Carrie and another friend when Marco stopped by to pick up her car and they started making out at the table. Lots of embracing, giggling, open mouth kissing, etc.\n\nMy chair was directly facing Carrie so I repositioned myself so I could face my friend and continue the conversation we were having. 10 minutes later, Marco gets up, waves at us and leaves. Carrie just smiles and says \u201cwhere were we?\u201d\n\nThis has happened at every friend gathering where both are present. Much like the coffee incident, I pivot my position so I can focus my attention on whomever I\u2019m speaking to. \n\nWhere I might be TA is in regard to Carrie\u2019s birthday. She\u2019s having an intimate dinner, inviting a couple of friends, me, and of course Marco. When she asked if I was coming, I told her I had to decline, but I would love to take her to dinner soon. She asked if I had a conflict. I said I did not, and she asked why things had changed. I asked if we could FaceTime so we could talk face to face and she called me. \n\nI told her that I love spending time with her, and I\u2019m so happy for her and Marco, but that I get uncomfortable with excessive PDA. Every time we\u2019ve hung out together, they\u2019ve gotten into at least one 5+ min makeout session and I\u2019d prefer not to upset her on her birthday by often repositioning myself/exiting the room. \n\nCarrie said I\u2019m jealous because I\u2019m single and that if I can\u2019t be happy for her, then we may have to rethink our friendship. \n\nI told her that PDA makes me uncomfortable in general and it\u2019s not specific to her and Marco at all. I referenced other friends where I\u2019ve turned when they\u2019re giving a goodbye kiss, etc. I referenced former relationships where I\u2019ve kept displays of affection to a minimum, only kissing a boyfriend in public when it was New Year\u2019s. \n\nCarrie said then the PDA issue is my problem to deal with and I said yes, of course it is my problem. Which is why I declined her invite. She hung up and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. \n\nMarco texted and said I upset Carrie and that I should patch things up with her. I said that I would do my best but it wouldn\u2019t lessen my discomfort with 30-40somethings making out like teenagers. He simply sent a shrug emoji. \n\nSome of our friends have agreed that the PDA is too much but have said that I should\u2019ve just gone along with Carrie\u2019s birthday and had the conversation later, when there wasn\u2019t already an event on the horizon. \n\nAITA for declining Carrie\u2019s invite to her birthday?", "created_utc": 1685476626, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w0ccn/aita_for_declining_an_invite_due_to_my_friends/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They\u2019re acting like horny teenagers I\u2019d be irritated as well.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing for you. You sat down and talked with her in a private setting about your issue and set a boundary. She can be upset about your decision, but ultimately that's on her.", "NTA. Not at all. There's a time and place for everything, and when you're with your friends it is not the time for a heavy make-out session. At the very least not *every* hangout.", "NTA - handled perfectly, no notes.", "NTA It is absolutely your right not to put yourself into situations that make you uncomfortable. You explained this to your friend, and she refuses to be considerate of your feelings. That's not a friend I'd even want.", "NTA. You can decline an invite for whatever reason you want.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't demand she and Marco stop, you declined an invitation where you knew they'd be sucking face.\n\nWhen I was younger we'd say, \"Geez, guys get a room!\" and the obnoxious PDA would usually stop after a few times. Sometimes people do realize how much they do it and that people are uncomfortable. Then you have the people that *want* people to see.", "Making out in front of people after you turn probably 16 is incredibly tacky (at least in the US, different strokes for different cultures and all).  It just makes you look lame and trashy.  If you are an adult presumably you have places to do these sort of things in privacy.  If you don't, at least go to a movie theater and sit in the back or something.", "NTA how old is she??? 5+ minute makeout session while surrounded by friends trying to have a good time is excessive. you politely declined and she acted like a teenager (fitting) by being irrational and blaming you\n\nI don\u2019t understand why some people have such a problem with a person taking themselves out of a situation they are uncomfortable with. by all means, PDA it up at your birthday! I just will not be there\u2026 shouldn\u2019t be a problem", "NTA. Love it when you take responsibility for your own issues and when someone asks about it and you're honest, they get upset. Like, it wouldn't have been a problem if you didn't push, so don't get pissy with me.\n\nHope you're able to work it out. Don't understand how it's hard for 30 and 40 year olds to not have a 5+ minute makeout session but as Marco said '\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f'", "Honestly I think you handled a not so graceful situation with grace. It sounds like she was a little defensive because she doesn't want to change behavior but also doesn't want her friends to distance themselves from her and your conversation made it clear that's a choice she'll have to make... Especially if other friends have been feeling the same even if they didn't bring it up yet.\n\nNTA, bordering N A H but the story you shared of the cafe makes it sound like, regardless of PDA factor, she recognizes she's kinda just ignoring her friends suddenly and entirely whenever bf enters the room until he leaves, including at hangouts he's not a part of, and expects folks to just go along with it... Which kinda sucks", "NTA - I am 42yo and I wouldn\u2019t put it with it. It\u2019s just too much.", "LOL NTA. My best friend is the exact same way and then questions why I don't like to be the 3rd wheel.", "NTA.

It sounds like they're being extremely rude, but if you can't handle a quick kiss goodbye without getting uncomfortable and only think that you can kiss your SO in public when it's New Years, it sounds like your standards are pretty unreasonable.", "I\u2019m sure if you guys sit down to talk again, and listen to each other with an open mind, there is probably a compromise that could be reached. The puppy love phase of their relationship won\u2019t last nearly as long as your guys\u2019 relationship has, so maybe grit your teeth and bare it in the meantime. There will always be things that people do that bother someone else, but a mature person learns to deal with things that make them uncomfortable. Hope you guys work it out", "INFO\n\nWhy y'all hang around an old dude like Marco?\n\n> I\u2019ve known Carrie for nearly 20 years and Marco probably about 12 or 13 years. \n\nSo he was in his mid-30s hanging out with just-barely 20yos?", "NTA. You were respectful and clear about your personal boundaries, and quietly removed yourself from a situation you knew you would find uncomfortable. You didn\u2019t make a big fuss about the PDA or demand that Mark and Carrie change their behaviour; you didn\u2019t even *mention* it until she pushed, and then you explained it as gently and carefully as you could. Plus, while constantly declining invitations will inevitably lead to a change in relationships over time, no one is actually obliged to *accept* an invitation if they don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s not a legal obligation. Carrie had no right to be so demanding about this, or to start throwing around unkind remarks about you being jealous because you happen to be single.", "NTA. I think you stated your boundaries very clearly. You didn't ask them to stop, you just made it clear that you didn't want to be around to watch their make out sessions. Good on you for handling this very maturely. :-)", "NTA. You marked your boundary and the decent and guts to explain your position. Further, you owned that it's \"your problem,\" and, hence why you are removing yourself from her special day. I actually your actions admirable and wish more people were straightforward.\n\nI hope things can be patched up.", "Absolutely not. NTA.\n\nIt's awkward! It's not even (entirely) the level of physical intimacy IMO, it's emotional intimacy/abrupt cutting out of the conversation. What are you supposed to *do* when people, mid-conversation, suddenly start focusing super hard on each other? \n\nI had friends who didn't make out, but did at the drop of the hat start being super snuggly in a way that made continuing conversation impossible. It's like, seriously, what are you expecting me to do when that happens? It's rude to stare. Lucky I have a phone, haha.", "Nta - you did the adult thing and politely removed yourself from a situation that made you uncomfortable, when asked, you again politely told her the truth. But she then had to turn it around and insult you and expect you to do something that made you feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m sorry. NTA", "I certainly don\u2019t understand it, but I have tried to chalk it up to the honeymoon phase of the relationship\u2026but it\u2019s been going on nearly 6 months now, so who knows??", "Right? They\u2019re acting like they\u2019re in line at an amusement park.", ">but if you can't handle a quick kiss goodbye without getting uncomfortable and only think that you can kiss your SO in public when it's New Years\n\n\n\nBut what you said isn't at all what Op said. It isn't anything quick.\n\nRead again", "I appreciate this take, thank you! I have reached out to Carrie asking if she and I can sit down in person and talk this out.", "Carrie and I were in the same book club as Marco right when she was graduating college. The romantic interest between the two of them didn\u2019t develop until late last year I guess.", "Maybe they are exhibitionists and people being there heightens the experience. No one should ever be required to participate in a friend\u2019s kink. Just speculating but definitely NTA", "She\u2019s upset with you because she knows her behavior with Marco is over the top.  You told her about her and Marco\u2019s behavior making you uncomfortable in a mature, un confrontational manner.  You called her out, she\u2019s embarrassed and blocked you.  If she actually didn\u2019t take to heart what you said, she wouldn\u2019t have said anything to Marco.  You\u2019re right about the honeymoon phase.  When it ends, which we all know it will, she\u2019ll probably rethink her rash decision about your comments and contact you.  20 years is a long friendship to dissolve over making out in front of friends.", "Maybe she's insecure in her relationship and needs others validation.", ">I referenced other friends where I\u2019ve turned when they\u2019re giving a goodbye kiss, etc. I referenced former relationships where I\u2019ve kept displays of affection to a minimum, only kissing a boyfriend in public when it was New Year\u2019s. \n\nThese are other friends kissing goodbye, who presumably have normal boundaries around PDA.", "You nailed it!", "NTA\n\nPDA is one thing. Being front row half a meter away when those you are having a conversation with delve into a 5 minute facial foreplay is completely different. I've had the misfortune of being in this exact situation myself and it was so awkward it was insane. Like. If you want to make out, please don't do it in the middle of conversation and right in my face?? Should be common sense!", "NTA.\n\nI'm also not comfortable with excessive pda and look away/remove myself. I don't expect anyone to do anything different, neither did you."]}
