OP is making it seem like it\u2019s a big deal to the bride and she\u2019s gonna make a stink about it if they don\u2019t get one. Idk if that\u2019s the case. Maybe OP will but their foot down and it will be fine. That would be the best case scenario. But the way it\u2019s painted out, it seems like a pain and PERSONALLY, i would get the spray tan. Because I just don\u2019t care that much. To me, it is not some moral question. I think you\u2019re crazy if you think asking someone to lighten their skin is the same as a spray tan. Ask yourself this: WOULD the bride ask a POC to lighten their skin for her wedding? Obviously not LOL. So it\u2019s very obviously not the same thing!", "Oh man. It sounds like a difficult family relationship so you may choose to suck it up for the sake of not giving in to the drama but if you do, just pretend that the wedding theme is Jersey Shore cosplay.\n\nNTA. You know your own skin.", "NTA. I\u2019ve been a bridesmaid more times than I care to even count, and there were mandatory spray tans for two of them. The first wedding I was orange and itchy, the second I spent the night before having an allergic reaction and was out of it the next day due to antihistamine medication. \n\nBrides suck.", "Clearly nta, your body your rules. Bridezilla has no say in it", "Here\u2019s the funny thing - the orange Oompa Loompa look is just the look of a bad spray tan. With a good spray tan, there are other color additives that get added to the mix based on the skin tone of the individual for it to not look orange or bad at all.", "That's what I pictured. A line of \"accidental\" orange bridesmaids and the bride smirking soaking up all the limelight. After it's mY WeDdiNg DaY !!!"]}
