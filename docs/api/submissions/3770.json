{"id": 3770, "submission_id": "zan6ij", "title": "WIBTA for asking my husband for half of his savings?", "selftext": "18 months ago, my (36F) husband (33M) and I bought a new house. When we sold our previous house, we came away with a significant profit (about $65-70k) that we decided to keep instead of putting into the new house - this was pretty much all profit, not equity that he paid into the house. All of this went into my husbands account, which already had a healthy savings. He gave me maybe $4k. At the time, I didn\u2019t ask for more because I (wrongly) assumed that I would have some access in emergencies and would also get a say in how this money was spent. \n\nIn the first 6 months, he paid off his truck ($18k), then upgraded his truck, TWICE ($25k total). Since then, he hasn\u2019t made any big purchases and instead has just saved as much as possible, building his account to over $30k. \n\nHe admits he is a cheapskate, and I acknowledge his ability to save is helpful, like when we moved to this area from out-of-state, he used his savings at the time. He grew up poor and has admitted that it terrifies him to go back to living like that. We have 3 kids (16M - mine, and 7M and 5mM - ours), and I just came off maternity leave in September. From that time, I had 2 months that my pay was cut in half, but I still paid all \u201cmy\u201d bills. I had a break down at one point and admitted that I was in trouble financially from years of taking out high interest loans in emergencies because he is not easy to ask for money - he gets angry and accuses me of using him for an atm, or I have to promise to pay him back at my next pay check - so I avoid asking him for money at all costs. His solution was to co-sign a loan through his bank that I will pay. We make approximately the same monthly, and try to keep things even as much as possible, but typically by the end of the month, my account is negative. Lately, he has had to pay a bit more of the groceries, but I still cover as much as I possibly can. \n\nNow you have the background (from my perspective), so this is where I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the AH. \n\nWhenever  we talk about making a bigger purchase (vacation deposit, upgrading appliances, Christmas presents, etc), he makes comments about how he can\u2019t afford it and will have to wait or we just do without. I get upset when he says things like this because I live paycheck to paycheck, but I don\u2019t think he does because he has a huge savings to fall back on, so he CAN afford things. I haven\u2019t been able to get my car serviced or visit the eye doctor due to not being able to afford it. \n\nSo, AITA for being upset about all this and expecting my husband to help me more financially, and further/more importantly, WIBTA expecting him to now give me half of what is in his account so I can be a little more financially secure?\n\nETA: the house was purchased after we were married, this was not \u201chis\u201d house. Before we got together, my credit was good enough to purchase a house, by myself, but has since tanked. Also, even though I was not on either mortgage and he paid the actual mortgage, I paid all utilities and childcare expenses up till 2 months ago (he now pays childcare and I give him part of mortgage to even it back out)", "created_utc": 1669989981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zan6ij/wibta_for_asking_my_husband_for_half_of_his/", "score": 305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk about actually splitting the profits of the sale of the house (not enough details), but the fact that you equally split the bills speaks to the fact that the house would have been something you were paying for too.  You have children together...and he spent like $43k on his TRUCK?  Not on the family?  You literally just had a baby, but this is solely your problem?  This isnt about him growing up poor, this is financial abuse.", "Nta if both your names were on that house, you get half the sale.", "NTA, but I\u2019m actually really concerned WHY he wants to keep so much money in just HIS back accounts,", "NTA.  It appears that you were married at the time the previous home was purchased.  If so, then you are entitled to half the profit from the sale of the home.   IMO you need advice of an attorney.  First visit is usually free.  A couple of things stick out.  Why isn't medical care a family obligation?   Why isn't your car a family obligation?   Is husband abusive?  Again...

You both need to have a serious conversation about your finances. Make a spreadsheet on excel of all your monthly expenses. Use a program (like mint) to see where all your money is going. Since you are married you both have a right to know where all the money is being spent and then you can adjust who pays for what based on this. There\u2019s no reason you should be taking out loans to do things like go to the eye doctor (and tbh this is prob hurting your credit). Vacations should be consciously saved for. Savings is not for everyday spending so any big purchases from that should be discussed. Yes you are entitled to the savings (get a joint account?) but not necessarily entitled to spend it without both agreeing. This is going to hurt your relationship if you can\u2019t get on the same page.\n\nEdit: IMO (after reading your replies) if he doesn\u2019t agree to be this transparent he\u2019s purposely being financially abusive and you may as well leave him so you get your half and can start repairing your credit.", "NTA he is financially screwing with you - also he is clearly not 'good at saving money' when he's blown most of it on a shiny truck is he?

Did he pick up more of the bills during that time to account for that? Did he equally share the cost of medical care associated with the pregnancy and birth? Was you being a SAHM a joint decision? How were expenses handled during that time?", "NTA. What he's doing is called financial abuse. Sure it doesn't look like some of the other cases we've all seen but his anger surrounding you asking for \"help\" constitutes it. You absolutely should have received half the profit from the sale...especially if he wasn't giving you access to the account.

You're looking at the money in savings as money that is there to spend. He's looking at it as money in savings, minus his initial buys. I say ESH. His comments about you using him as an ATM are wholly unnecessary and degrading. I think on your end, you should try to see his perspective about not using the savings so readily. Vacations and presents aren't emergencies. Neither are appliance upgrades if they aren't necessary.\n\nETA my comment is based in the assumption that this is a house he owned prior to them getting married", "NTA. From your comments the house sold was a purchase after you where married. Meaning he should not have given you 4k but half of the profit from selling. Now things like vacation and Christmas gifts are things you both should contribute to. Appliance upgrades really should be thought of as a shared expense but the question is if you need it because it's broken down or just want a new one. That will change honestly if your stove (example) is broken and won't work at all vs just being old and wanting a new one. If the first then yeah it should be a priority to get. If the second then you can do without until you get a bit saved up. Your medical is not the same. It should be a priority and should automatically come from both and not be expected to pay back to one or the other but that's an argument you will need to have out with him. Now in all honesty you should not ask for half his saving. You need to ask for your remaining half of the sale from the previous houses sale. You not being on the thing is not withstand as you are married and was a decision made because you likely would not have gotten the house if you where on it.", "NTA - he needs to seek therapy for this. IMO there is some childhood trauma keeping him from living his life. He needs individual therapy, and you both would benefit from marriage and financial counseling.", "Is this a marriage or a roommate situation. Why are you living paycheck-to-paycheck when it is supposed to be a union . Wtf. Y\u2019all need counseling .\n- ESH .", "NTA but I do have questions. Who paid for the previous house? you say \"our\" house but he's acting like it was his, that HE paid for it, so in his mind, he's entitled to ALL the profit realized from the sale. If not, then you def. have issues. He seems to be hoarding that money, and using it for stuff he wants, but when it comes to family stuff, i.e. vacations, he's very stingy.", "[deleted]", "You're clearly not being financially responsible if you're consistently ending up in the negatives.  You need to set a budget and keep to it. You need to identify what is necessary, what it will cost, and create a plan to pay for it. \n\n Living within your means is the only way to be financially stable.  Spending savings on Christmas and vacations is not rational spending behavior. When he says he \"can't afford it\", he's saying it isn't responsible to spend outside what his salary allows. \n\nPaying off that loan would only be a smart thing to do if you wouldn't just drag the family right back into debt with stupid purchases.

You are both AH for taking money from family and relying on them to co-sign.   You say your family paid for roof repairs.  Did you repay them?   Your husband is not entitled to the profits of the home if you paid half the mortgage.  You also are not in a position to go on vacations or buy new appliances just because you have.

You and your husband have roughly the same income & expenses so why are you short and he is able to save. Your budget should include money saved for emergencies before spending on discretionary expenses. Regularly relying on someone to loan you money is not a good solution. The fact that he doesn't have emergencies despite having same income & expenses should be a wake up call to you.  You should have a line item in your budget for unexpected expenses and save for that before spending on fun stuff.\n\nI wouldn't put the help that your husband is providing in parentheses.  He is providing you with help by giving you a lower interest loan.

I honestly would tell him that you think you need to separate so that you force him to support his only children.    Tell him that alternatively you need to sell the new house and get something cheaper because you can not afford your half of the  house you are living in and all your other obligations.   Budgeting is more than bargain shopping.   Again, nothing you listed is an emergency and they are all things that should be in your budget.   Your budget is not complete enough.   You need to add these expenses to your budget and that money has to come from somewhere.

In his mind, he is out of debt, and if you combine finances, he\u2019ll be back in debt. He views you as a financial risk. That is an issue for a marriage counselor. \n\nSecond: it sounds like BOTH of you have issues with money. You have a lot of debt, he is hoarding assets. Look up the rules in your state- even if you were not on the loan, if you properly helped buy property #2 (that generated the profit), you are likely still entitled to share the profit even if you were not on the loan. Depends on the state, not legal advice, etc, but google anyway. \n\nThird: he is intertwining previous debt and current bills. They are not the same. Even if you made bad decisions in the past, it doesn\u2019t mean he can keep letting you dig yourself into a hole because it preserves his goal. Kid expenses are JOINT expenses. What happens if you just don\u2019t pay the school fee? Why does he consider that a \u201cyou\u201d expense?\n\nAll that said- I don\u2019t think asking for half the profit is the solution at this time. I think first you need to prove you can be financially dependable and open a joint account, or at least ask him to be responsible for half the kid expenses as the bills come in, if he prefers. If you budget, keep receipts and show him at the end of the month, and ask him to pay half. \n\nNow, you are going to get push back. A lot of it, it sounds like. If you think things are not going to go well, it\u2019s time to start keeping meticulous records. Get a budgeting software, take pictures of receipts. Copy all the paperwork from your property sales, the truck purchases, loan documents, medical bills, etc. Because if the time comes to divide assets contentiously, you are going to need those, and he is probably going to deny they exist. \n\nFinally, a financial counselor sounds like it could be extremely beneficial to both of you. Future savings, properly investing the savings he does have, preparing for emergencies. Perhaps filing for bankruptcy might be the best option for you. I don\u2019t know, but a professional can help. Your husband may be more open to that than marriage counseling, since he is so focused on finances. \n\nTLDR: you need both marriage and financial counseling. There are real household shared expenses, and he needs to acknowledge that. In the mean time, be prepared if your husband disagrees. Good luck, it sounds like an extremely hard situation.", "Seems like signs of financial abuse.\n\nOne partner has a large amount of money and the other lives paycheck to paycheck and is afraid to ask for anything.", "My thoughts exactly, \n\nHe gets to watch her beg for pennies and knows she can never leave him", "So I think there\u2019s been some confusion about my initial statement of bigger purchases, where it somehow got twisted as I consider those things \u201cemergency\u201d funds.

Christmas presents for OUR children, while I recognize that I would get the things MY child wants, and then the appliances are something he has expressed an interest in replacing, but when we start talking about paying for it, all of a sudden we can\u2019t afford it until it breaks.

I don\u2019t even remember when I took out the first loan, but it then became a nasty cycle of increasing payments trying to stay afloat, which also has tanked my credit. \n\nI acknowledge that I am not the greatest with money, and there was a time that I offered to send him the money to pay the bills, then my concern was that if I sent \u201ctoo much\u201d and needed some back for something (clothes, gas, food, whatever) I would get some push back and wouldn\u2019t get it. I am trying to be better financially, but when I\u2019m already in a cycle I can\u2019t get out of, it\u2019s hard to do better with the same amount coming in. \n\nThe main point of my post was the profit (sold the house for $80k more than we paid, after closing costs on the new house, leaving $65-70k PROFIT), that I don\u2019t feel as though I have equal access and definitely did not get an equal share.", "Is taking her half of the previous homes profit and paying her nothing for the childcare she provided to their shared children while she was on maternity at reduced income really considered being good with money? It sounds more like taking advantage of your spouse to me.", "We actually have not gone on vacation that my family has not paid for the accommodations since being together. He mentioned wanting to do one this summer with friends and their kids, but when it came to pay, I felt like since he would have to pay, he no longer liked the idea. \n\nAlso, the truck upgrades, I mean, he sold an older truck, got a newer one ($20k) then an even newer one ($5k). So that\u2019s 3 DIFFERENT trucks in the last 18months.", "Thanks for your comments. I understand your perspective and I think I\u2019m coming to realize that I\u2019m bitter/angry about him not sharing the house profits with me, then spending $43k on paying off then getting new trucks in this time. Because if he really was concerned about just saving to make sure our family is secure, it doesn\u2019t seem like the truck thing would really have been the priority. But again, thanks for the perspective/feedback.", "Well said!", "But she also says that before their marriage her credit was good enough to buy a house \\*on her own\\* -  I realize that was a different market, but there's nothing to indicate that OP would suddenly tank her credit and become bad with money as the evidence shows something about the marriage has caused that.    \n\n\nYou're right that we don't know what those vacations entail, etc, etc.  I do wonder about a person who doesn't want to pay for an eye appointment but will for a vacation, and from that I see credence to your argument.    \n\n\nI see why there's concern here that OP is being fleeced, I guess.  Childcare is expensive and she's been paying for it for all 15 years for an increasing number of kids, too, exclusively?  It feels weird all around.", "I do not shop or spend on things I do not need (I have shoes that are falling apart and don\u2019t feel like I can get new and have only gotten clothes since pregnancy that were 2nd hand or he purchased on sale for my birthday). \nAlso, the total for vacation would have been $2k for our accommodations, then I would have, rightly so, helped with boarding animals/gas/food/activities/etc. when the vacation actually occurred this summer. we have not gone on vacation since being together unless it was paid for mostly by my family.", "> We purchased together after moving to a new state. My name was not on the loan and a family member co-signed because my credit had been destroyed and I still owned my previous house, that was solely mine, but there weren\u2019t any profits from that one to split.\n\nshe apparently had her own house that she only broke even on when selling. so no profit, but where did the money go?\n\n> I should have gotten half, or at least enough to give me a similar cushion for financial security, so I COULD stick to my budget and am prepared in emergency situations.\n\nso she needs a one-time windfall just to be able to stick to her \"budget\"?\n\nIt's also not clear who actually paid for the mortgage, OP just keeps saying her family helped by co-signing.\n\n> Finally, the emergencies defined in a previous response are not possible to plan for all the time: medical expenses, school fees at times for our children, clothing for our children, and these are all the things that I pay 90% of the time\n\nclothes for the kids and school fees are *not* unexpected expenses one can't budget for.\n\nSo there's probably more that's missing here..\n\n> Also, even though I was not on either mortgage and he paid the actual mortgage, I paid all utilities and childcare expenses up till 2 months ago (he now pays childcare and I give him part of mortgage to even it back out)\n\nEdit: He actually pays for the mortgage, I'm assuming the same is true for the first house. And the baby was born 5 months ago, she was on maternity leave until 3 months ago and her husband started paying for childcare 2 months ago... So she actually only paid for a single month of childcare (I'm assuming the 7 year old is attending school)?", "Guy spends 25k on a truckgrades but doesn't let his wife see the eye doctor? Regardless of whatever else is going on, he's effectively prioritizing his toys over her medical care. Sounds like an asshole.", "I think, and may have misread, that he spent 18k to pay off the truck and with the upgrades, 7k, the total spent was 25k.\n\nBut I could be wrong.\n\nStill though, 7k is a pretty penny. Though I wonder what the OP considers an upgrade. Like lights and a sound system? Or tires and suspension?", "But he keeps spending it. That makes NO sense.", ">I think that his concerns on wanting a decent amount saved and wanting to \u201cprotect\u201d that money himself isn\u2019t entirely unjustified\n\nIt's interesting to me that OP says her credit has \"tanked\" since they got together, and that they make about the same money but she frequently runs out.

There's no one right way to handle finances as a couple, but right now you're both left feeling resentful -- him for being \"used as an atm,\" you for feeling like he's excessively controlling what you can/can't buy. \n\nThis is going to blow up in your faces. \n\nFind a time when you're both relatively calm, not stressed, you don't have to be somewhere in 20 minutes, nobody's tired or hungry .... and *talk about it*.

And she shouldn't be taking out loans without consulting him. \n\nIf he is financially abusive, it's still in his best interest to help her either budget properly, or to help her pay off loans and help provide money for eye exams and what not if she needs it. Unless I'm mistaken, in some states, in the case of a spouse dying or a divorce, some of the debt can be given to the other spouse. Because if it's gotten during the marriage, it's considered marital property and can be split 50-50. So it's also in his best interest that she pays off her loans asap, so if a worst case scenario happens, he won't then be landed with a crap ton of debt. \n\nLike medical debt. If a person gets cancer and racks up all this debt to get the treatment they need, if they end up passing away, their spouse still has to pay it off in some places, even if the bill was only ever billed to the patient.
