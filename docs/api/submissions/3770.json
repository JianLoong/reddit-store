{"id": 3770, "submission_id": "zan6ij", "title": "WIBTA for asking my husband for half of his savings?", "selftext": "18 months ago, my (36F) husband (33M) and I bought a new house. When we sold our previous house, we came away with a significant profit (about $65-70k) that we decided to keep instead of putting into the new house - this was pretty much all profit, not equity that he paid into the house. All of this went into my husbands account, which already had a healthy savings. He gave me maybe $4k. At the time, I didn\u2019t ask for more because I (wrongly) assumed that I would have some access in emergencies and would also get a say in how this money was spent. \n\nIn the first 6 months, he paid off his truck ($18k), then upgraded his truck, TWICE ($25k total). Since then, he hasn\u2019t made any big purchases and instead has just saved as much as possible, building his account to over $30k. \n\nHe admits he is a cheapskate, and I acknowledge his ability to save is helpful, like when we moved to this area from out-of-state, he used his savings at the time. He grew up poor and has admitted that it terrifies him to go back to living like that. We have 3 kids (16M - mine, and 7M and 5mM - ours), and I just came off maternity leave in September. From that time, I had 2 months that my pay was cut in half, but I still paid all \u201cmy\u201d bills. I had a break down at one point and admitted that I was in trouble financially from years of taking out high interest loans in emergencies because he is not easy to ask for money - he gets angry and accuses me of using him for an atm, or I have to promise to pay him back at my next pay check - so I avoid asking him for money at all costs. His solution was to co-sign a loan through his bank that I will pay. We make approximately the same monthly, and try to keep things even as much as possible, but typically by the end of the month, my account is negative. Lately, he has had to pay a bit more of the groceries, but I still cover as much as I possibly can. \n\nNow you have the background (from my perspective), so this is where I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the AH. \n\nWhenever  we talk about making a bigger purchase (vacation deposit, upgrading appliances, Christmas presents, etc), he makes comments about how he can\u2019t afford it and will have to wait or we just do without. I get upset when he says things like this because I live paycheck to paycheck, but I don\u2019t think he does because he has a huge savings to fall back on, so he CAN afford things. I haven\u2019t been able to get my car serviced or visit the eye doctor due to not being able to afford it. \n\nSo, AITA for being upset about all this and expecting my husband to help me more financially, and further/more importantly, WIBTA expecting him to now give me half of what is in his account so I can be a little more financially secure?\n\nETA: the house was purchased after we were married, this was not \u201chis\u201d house. Before we got together, my credit was good enough to purchase a house, by myself, but has since tanked. Also, even though I was not on either mortgage and he paid the actual mortgage, I paid all utilities and childcare expenses up till 2 months ago (he now pays childcare and I give him part of mortgage to even it back out)", "created_utc": 1669989981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zan6ij/wibta_for_asking_my_husband_for_half_of_his/", "score": 43, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk about actually splitting the profits of the sale of the house (not enough details), but the fact that you equally split the bills speaks to the fact that the house would have been something you were paying for too.  You have children together...and he spent like $43k on his TRUCK?  Not on the family?  You literally just had a baby, but this is solely your problem?  This isnt about him growing up poor, this is financial abuse.", "Nta if both your names were on that house, you get half the sale.", "NTA, but I\u2019m actually really concerned WHY he wants to keep so much money in just HIS back accounts,", "NTA.  It appears that you were married at the time the previous home was purchased.  If so, then you are entitled to half the profit from the sale of the home.   IMO you need advice of an attorney.  First visit is usually free.  A couple of things stick out.  Why isn't medical care a family obligation?   Why isn't your car a family obligation?   Is husband abusive?  Again...

You both need to have a serious conversation about your finances. Make a spreadsheet on excel of all your monthly expenses. Use a program (like mint) to see where all your money is going. Since you are married you both have a right to know where all the money is being spent and then you can adjust who pays for what based on this. There\u2019s no reason you should be taking out loans to do things like go to the eye doctor (and tbh this is prob hurting your credit). Vacations should be consciously saved for. Savings is not for everyday spending so any big purchases from that should be discussed. Yes you are entitled to the savings (get a joint account?) but not necessarily entitled to spend it without both agreeing. This is going to hurt your relationship if you can\u2019t get on the same page.\n\nEdit: IMO (after reading your replies) if he doesn\u2019t agree to be this transparent he\u2019s purposely being financially abusive and you may as well leave him so you get your half and can start repairing your credit.", "NTA he is financially screwing with you - also he is clearly not 'good at saving money' when he's blown most of it on a shiny truck is he?

Did he pick up more of the bills during that time to account for that? Did he equally share the cost of medical care associated with the pregnancy and birth? Was you being a SAHM a joint decision? How were expenses handled during that time?", "NTA. What he's doing is called financial abuse. Sure it doesn't look like some of the other cases we've all seen but his anger surrounding you asking for \"help\" constitutes it. You absolutely should have received half the profit from the sale...especially if he wasn't giving you access to the account.

You're looking at the money in savings as money that is there to spend. He's looking at it as money in savings, minus his initial buys. I say ESH. His comments about you using him as an ATM are wholly unnecessary and degrading. I think on your end, you should try to see his perspective about not using the savings so readily. Vacations and presents aren't emergencies. Neither are appliance upgrades if they aren't necessary.\n\nETA my comment is based in the assumption that this is a house he owned prior to them getting married", "NTA. From your comments the house sold was a purchase after you where married. Meaning he should not have given you 4k but half of the profit from selling. Now things like vacation and Christmas gifts are things you both should contribute to. Appliance upgrades really should be thought of as a shared expense but the question is if you need it because it's broken down or just want a new one. That will change honestly if your stove (example) is broken and won't work at all vs just being old and wanting a new one. If the first then yeah it should be a priority to get. If the second then you can do without until you get a bit saved up. Your medical is not the same. It should be a priority and should automatically come from both and not be expected to pay back to one or the other but that's an argument you will need to have out with him. Now in all honesty you should not ask for half his saving. You need to ask for your remaining half of the sale from the previous houses sale. You not being on the thing is not withstand as you are married and was a decision made because you likely would not have gotten the house if you where on it.", "NTA - he needs to seek therapy for this. IMO there is some childhood trauma keeping him from living his life. He needs individual therapy, and you both would benefit from marriage and financial counseling.", "Is this a marriage or a roommate situation. Why are you living paycheck-to-paycheck when it is supposed to be a union . Wtf. Y\u2019all need counseling .\n- ESH .", "NTA but I do have questions. Who paid for the previous house? you say \"our\" house but he's acting like it was his, that HE paid for it, so in his mind, he's entitled to ALL the profit realized from the sale. If not, then you def. have issues. He seems to be hoarding that money, and using it for stuff he wants, but when it comes to family stuff, i.e. vacations, he's very stingy.", "[deleted]", "You're clearly not being financially responsible if you're consistently ending up in the negatives.  You need to set a budget and keep to it. You need to identify what is necessary, what it will cost, and create a plan to pay for it. \n\n Living within your means is the only way to be financially stable.  Spending savings on Christmas and vacations is not rational spending behavior. When he says he \"can't afford it\", he's saying it isn't responsible to spend outside what his salary allows. \n\nPaying off that loan would only be a smart thing to do if you wouldn't just drag the family right back into debt with stupid purchases.

You are both AH for taking money from family and relying on them to co-sign.   You say your family paid for roof repairs.  Did you repay them?   Your husband is not entitled to the profits of the home if you paid half the mortgage.  You also are not in a position to go on vacations or buy new appliances just because you have.

My name was not on the loan and a family member co-signed because my credit had been destroyed and I still owned my previous house, that was solely mine, but there weren\u2019t any profits from that one to split.", "Thanks for the feedback, a couple answers to your questions:\nGrad school was absolutely my choice, but we had a baby during that time and then there was a joint decision for me to stay home, with the understanding I cashed out a retirement account, took the max on loans to cover some of the expenses, and I had a $10k grant during internship, so that alone did not result in the tanking of my score, it was more that if i needed any more, asking him for it was always an argument, and so I was late on payments a few times. \nThe money from family for the roof was repaid when the first house was sold, and we had to have co-signer because when we moved, there was no longer a significant work history for either of us and we didn\u2019t want to rent, just to move again a year later, and we refinanced a year later to remove the family member. \nFinally, the emergencies defined in a previous response are not possible to plan for all the time: medical expenses, school fees at times for our children, clothing for our children, and these are all the things that I pay 90% of the time. The vacation, appliances and Christmas present part were not the best examples and I do not consider any of those purchases as emergencies, rather just examples of the things I get frustrated about that have come up recently. \n\nThere was a lot more i wanted to add in my post but the word limit prevented it, but thank you for your opinion.", "That\u2019s a fair comment, except he kept the vast majority of the profits from that house. That makes up the bulk of \u201chis\u201d savings. \n\nHe actually spent on his money on his car ect, what remains is hers.", "I understand this perspective, but some of the emergencies that I was not able to reference include maternity leave, medical bills that were not covered by insurance, travel expenses, school fees, etc. I don\u2019t make extravagant purchases and typically go to second hand stores as much as possible for clothing/shoes. Thank you for the feedback.", "The Cheapskate title is actually how he refers to himself. For whatever reason, his vehicles are acceptable expenses where he will spend the money, but most everything else he spends the absolute minimum or we just go without. And some of his saving/spending habits, I really DO appreciate, but this whole situation is incredibly convoluted because in my eyes, I should have gotten half, or at least enough to give me a similar cushion for financial security, so I COULD stick to my budget and am prepared in emergency situations.", "We make the same and household expenses are close to equal, but in emergencies, I needed cash, was afraid to ask him, took out high interest loans with high payments to help in the immediate, but quickly snowballed out of control and now these payments equal probably 1/4 of my monthly income. We sat down and went over all of it during my break down when we co-signed an additional loan with lower interest to \u201chelp\u201d.", "Please read the comments. It was their joint marital asset that was bought after marriage. So she is entitled to half the profit of the sale. \n\nAnd also even if it wasn\u2019t???? It\u2019s fucked up IN GENERAL to let your spouse drown in debt while you\u2019re able to help.", "I\u2019m honestly confused here. As the father of your child, why was he not covering costs while you were unable to work? \n\nHe sees your partnership very much as a me vs. you thing, and that\u2019s not something that would sit right with me. He allows you to suffer financially because of his own trauma about money. \n\nThat\u2019s not the way I would ever treat someone that I love and respect.", "But it\u2019s not just HIS money, it was the profit from THEIR house", "What they did with the proceeds from the house sale is. \n\nPeople also ask\nWhat is considered financial abuse?\nFinancial abuse is a common tactic used by abusers to gain power and control in a relationship. The forms of financial abuse may be subtle or overt but in in general, include tactics to conceal information, limit the victim's access to assets, or reduce accessibility to the family finances.", "It is financial abuse when he is upgrading his vehicle and she can\u2019t see a doctor because she\u2019s broke and contributing to the household when he clearly has money to help. A marriage should be a partnership it\u2019s not always 50/50. I guarantee he didn\u2019t lose any money while she was on maternity leave and not earning her usual salary and he expected her to contribute. He more than likely also didn\u2019t reimburse her for childcare expenses. If we want to get technical on his and her money. My husband earns way more than me and I pay a fraction of the expenses in our home.", "She answered in another comment that they bought the house after they were married and a relative of hers cosigned the loan", "Ah. I wish that had been added from the beginning. He's being unfair then.", "> Finally, the emergencies defined in a previous response are not possible to plan for all the time: medical expenses, school fees at times for our children, clothing for our children\n\nI don\u2019t understand how school fees and clothing would be emergencies", "You should not be paying 90% of the shared children\u2019s expenses.   Your husband needs to support your kids.  He doesn\u2019t need to support your oldest daughter.  Do you get child support for her? I really think you need to find a personal finance class and learn to properly budget.   The things that came up recently are absolutely possible to plan for.   There will me medical expenses every year.  There will be clothing and school fees every year.   You need to put estimates for these in your budget for each month.  If you don\u2019t spend it one month on the budgeted item, you save that money for the next month.   Have you heard of the envelope method? I think that might work well for you.", "INFO: did he not help cover medical bills and school fees?  Those are not \u201cyour\u201d expenses, that are joint household expenses. Is there a joint account for items like this?  I don\u2019t think asking for half the proceeds is going to accomplish what you want- I think you need a budget, a household account, and a frank discussion about what household expenses need to be shared. You have said he fears not having a cushion (though that does not explain trading in his truck twice). He has gone too far the opposite direction- does he know you want to go to the eye doctor and cannot afford it? What does he say?", "Was the sold house just his or both of yours? Who paid for it? Not legally but realistically, who paid off the loan?", "Don\u2019t buy the self-description. He\u2019s not a cheapskate. He chooses to spend inordinate amounts on what is important to him. This man has no respect for you or for the family unit. This may be fixable but step one will be you gaining control over AT LEAST HALF of the original house profit. The reason your credit is tanking is because your husband has convinced you that you are worthless. That\u2019s a bunch of different kinds of abuse.", "So the thing to ask yourself, is why are you having all of these emergencies?  Not meant as a criticism.  You and your husband have roughly the same income & expenses so why are you short and he is able to save. Your budget should include money saved for emergencies before spending on discretionary expenses. Regularly relying on someone to loan you money is not a good solution. The fact that he doesn't have emergencies despite having same income & expenses should be a wake up call to you.  You should have a line item in your budget for unexpected expenses and save for that before spending on fun stuff.\n\nI wouldn't put the help that your husband is providing in parentheses.  He is providing you with help by giving you a lower interest loan. It sounds like you regularly spend beyond your means.  \n\nYou did not answer about the home ownership so if he owned the home, then you are not entitled to the profits.\n\nAs for your maternity leave, he should not have asked for 50/50 split while you were on maternity leave. I would bring that up to him.", "Doesn't matter. If they were married when the house was purchased, it's marital property. Look at it this way, if she would get half of it in a divorce, then she should get half of it on the sale.\n\nThis doesn't change the fact that they need a budget and better communication.", "She paid for it as well? I looked and didn\u2019t see that info", "[deleted]", "If they both have salaries and the house was owned by the husband, then the profits of the house are his and this is not financial abuse.\n\nIf the house was owned by both of them then he is in the wrong. But if that was the case, the money should have gone straight to a shared account and wouldn\u2019t have gone straight to the husband. The facts given in the post suggest this isn\u2019t what happened.", "No, he sees the medical bills that have piled up and he says \u201cpay what you can when you can\u201d. We do not have a joint account. I mentioned it a few times when we first got married then again when we moved, but there\u2019s never been follow through, really on either part partially due to the convenience of already having all the auto pays set up on separate accounts. I have a budget, that I try very hard to follow, but when kids need clothes, or there\u2019s a sports fee, or a bill (medical or from some other unexpected event) it usually blows my budget up completely.", "Mate, don\u2019t be that guy who looks at everything in black and white, it\u2019s THIER house, they both pay for it, it will never be 50/50 when their are kids involved", "That doesn\u2019t explain or excuse the fact that he took all their joint money and put it in an account that only he has access too, and watching her beg for dregs to pay essential household bills", "The house was a marital asset purchased after the marriage. It was not just his.", "They\u2019re married. Don\u2019t get married if you don\u2019t want to share your money and expenses. There\u2019s no \u201call his or hers\u201d. That\u2019s why this could be viewed as financial abuse. Your spouse shouldn\u2019t be taking out high interest loans for daily expenses while the other is able to continue saving money.", "That's why we have courts, because I disagree.", "You need to insist that he pays the medical bills.  I am assuming these are your bills from having HIS child or are the bills for one of his children.  He is wrong to say those are your expenses.  If they happen to be for your older daughter, than he may be correct.    He is definitely taking advantage of you.   I honestly would tell him that you think you need to separate so that you force him to support his only children.    Tell him that alternatively you need to sell the new house and get something cheaper because you can not afford your half of the  house you are living in and all your other obligations.   Budgeting is more than bargain shopping.   Again, nothing you listed is an emergency and they are all things that should be in your budget.   Your budget is not complete enough.   You need to add these expenses to your budget and that money has to come from somewhere.   Likely you are house poor and too much of your budget is going to that.", "Okay, so this is going to be long, apologies. \n\nFirst: he is scared of debt. In his mind, he is out of debt, and if you combine finances, he\u2019ll be back in debt. He views you as a financial risk. That is an issue for a marriage counselor. \n\nSecond: it sounds like BOTH of you have issues with money. You have a lot of debt, he is hoarding assets. Look up the rules in your state- even if you were not on the loan, if you properly helped buy property #2 (that generated the profit), you are likely still entitled to share the profit even if you were not on the loan. Depends on the state, not legal advice, etc, but google anyway. \n\nThird: he is intertwining previous debt and current bills. They are not the same. Even if you made bad decisions in the past, it doesn\u2019t mean he can keep letting you dig yourself into a hole because it preserves his goal. Kid expenses are JOINT expenses. What happens if you just don\u2019t pay the school fee? Why does he consider that a \u201cyou\u201d expense?\n\nAll that said- I don\u2019t think asking for half the profit is the solution at this time. I think first you need to prove you can be financially dependable and open a joint account, or at least ask him to be responsible for half the kid expenses as the bills come in, if he prefers. If you budget, keep receipts and show him at the end of the month, and ask him to pay half. \n\nNow, you are going to get push back. A lot of it, it sounds like. If you think things are not going to go well, it\u2019s time to start keeping meticulous records. Get a budgeting software, take pictures of receipts. Copy all the paperwork from your property sales, the truck purchases, loan documents, medical bills, etc. Because if the time comes to divide assets contentiously, you are going to need those, and he is probably going to deny they exist. \n\nFinally, a financial counselor sounds like it could be extremely beneficial to both of you. Future savings, properly investing the savings he does have, preparing for emergencies. Perhaps filing for bankruptcy might be the best option for you. I don\u2019t know, but a professional can help. Your husband may be more open to that than marriage counseling, since he is so focused on finances. \n\nTLDR: you need both marriage and financial counseling. There are real household shared expenses, and he needs to acknowledge that. In the mean time, be prepared if your husband disagrees. Good luck, it sounds like an extremely hard situation.", "Seems like signs of financial abuse.\n\nOne partner has a large amount of money and the other lives paycheck to paycheck and is afraid to ask for anything.", "My thoughts exactly, \n\nHe gets to watch her beg for pennies and knows she can never leave him"]}
