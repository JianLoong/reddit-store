When he got home, he said there was something he needed to tell me. My heart skipped a beat, so I was actually relieved when he told me what happened, although it's pretty embarrassing.\n\nHe told me the story. On Saturday evening, I texted him a sexy photo, with the caption \"getting in the bath, miss u\" or something like that. Well, at the moment I sent it, he was evidently driving the rental car, and his friends were in the back seat with his phone, changing the music. So, they got the pic and saw it (three of them). I told him this was obviously not ideal, but shit happens, I get it. He said he didn't look at it as a big deal, hoped I didn't either.\n\nTwo of the guys told their wives, and I heard from both. The first wife texted me an \"omg I'm so sorry that happened are you ok?\" kind of message, it was sweet. But the other wife was weird about it. She was basically accusing me of being careless, and of not minding that these guys saw me naked. I let her know that I didn't think it was a big deal, actually, and wanted to move on. She responded with something so weird - she said \"we get it Lisa, you're hot and like to fuck\" with an eye roll emoji.\n\nIt really pissed me off! I told her I didn't appreciate that, and that the photo wasn't pornographic or anything. And then she asked to see it \"to put her mind at ease.\" It's all so weird.\n\nAITA here?

Her response, the \"we get it you're hot\", just screams of her total insecurity about you - she saw a chance to slut-shame someone she's jealous of, and LEAPT onto it - very typical behaviour for an insecure person.", "NTA  it\u2019s not like you sent it knowing your bfs friends were in the phone.

You never really truly know if there will be an ugly break up in the future or if someone gets his phone pictures or something dumb like that. Keep that in mind too.\n\nNTA tho.

He most certainly was way too happy when explaining the situation to his wife, which why do that in the first place if it was a harmelss mistake nothing to tell.
