That\u2019s not what you\u2019d call loosing it.\n\nThe fact that she constantly jokes about the attention she gets from other guys and that she finds them \u201cfuckable\u201d would be a deal breaker for me.

It has no real impact on our life so you appreciate the beauty, then move on.\n\nBy thinking about this other guy to the point where she crafted a joke about cheating with him, she took it too far, to the point that it became disrespectful to you.

If I didn't say one way or another she would ask if I thought they would be fun to have sex with. \n\nYou need to get a grip on your relationship.
