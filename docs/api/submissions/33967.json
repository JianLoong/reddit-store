Can't blame you for disliking the joke, though it does come across somewhat insecure. You say the joke was about 'some guy who likes her', so she probably just wanted to share a chuckle at his expense.", "NTA, fuck cheaters and fuck these Y-T-A votes", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If she doesn't have these same moment of unguarded \"humor\" attacks otherwise, your suspicions are well-founded, and when you catch her actually cheating she'll be the one saying \"it was nothing\". Beware her humor.", "You might be a little insecure? Both young and she might have been really being her goofy self - you gotta talk about stuff with her.", "So she knows a guy likes her and admitted she'd like to fuck him. I'd be out if I'm honest. NTA", "ESH.\n\nYou need anger management classes and she's definitely going to cheat on you.\n\n\"It's just a joke!\" is always a copout. What's the joke here? The joke is: \"I could cheat on you any time I wanted.\"\n\nSome joke.", "Can someone explain to me how she joked about cheating? She just joked about a guy. She didn\u2019t say she was going to ride him into the sunset. She just said he is available? Like\u2026 what. YTA you are totally insecure", "YTA\n\nNot for being upset re the joke, it sounds as if your GF probably didn't mean any harm. Your being upset shows it probably triggered something in you she isn't aware of.\n\nYou are TA for yelling/losing your s**t, as you put it though especially as she apologised.", "It's a joke,  not a dick. Don't take it so hard. \n\nThis seems as innocent as a \"your mom\" or \"in bed\" joke.", "Though her joke was stupid/inflammatory, it is always 100% your responsibility to keep your anger in check. ESH.", "YTA. She just made a lame joke and you attacked her verbally. You kept going after she apologized. You know your behavior was a huge overreaction.  The best thing is to apologize and check your anger in the future.", "YTA\n\nYou're ten ply, bud.", "ESH\n\nHer joke was tasteless, yes you were right to tell her it\u2019s not acceptable. \n\nHowever, you were over the top about it.", "NTA for getting upset and calling her out on the joke. Certain subjects just aren\u2019t funny at all, and her mentioning a guy that likes her that is doable is honestly not funny at all and very suspicious. \n\nYTA for loosing your temper. Yes, she hit a nerve and you have the right to be hurt but loosing it isn\u2019t the way. It would have been honestly much better if you asked for space; it would have gotten the message across, would have hit harder on how bad the situation got and would have made her reflect more on what she said\n\nEdit: I now see you didn\u2019t scream or anything on one of your comments. That\u2019s not what you\u2019d call loosing it.\n\nThe fact that she constantly jokes about the attention she gets from other guys and that she finds them \u201cfuckable\u201d would be a deal breaker for me. That\u2019s not a sense of humor, that is manipulative and hurtful.", "She either thinking about cheating or playing head games. You don\u2019t just say things like that out of the blue. NTA", "ESH, but mostly Y-T-A. She made a distasteful joke, sure, but she apologized for it whenever she saw that it upset you. You took this too far when you \u201clost your shit\u201d.", "Info: what do you mean by \"lost your shit\"? Like you got upset, kept asking questions, or yelled? \n\nIt sounds like commenters are thinking you were attacking her. My interpretation was you were asking questions in an upset manner trying to figure out the situation.", "YTA Telling her you didn't like joke fine, losing shit and grilling her about it is when you become AH", "neither but you have to be levelheaded when speaking of this subject.", "NTA jokes 99% of the time have a silver of truth in them, no loyal partner makes those jokes, GTFO out of there before you get hurt.", "YTA.  Everyone has jokes they don't like.  When she realised you didn't like it, she apologised profusely.  That should have been the end of it.", "For the original part - confronting her about a joke you found distasteful, NTA. \n\nFor losing your shit and grilling her about why cheating is on her mind - YTA since you blew it out of proportion - something triggered in you and you took it out on your gf.", "YTA - it\u2019s a joke and it didn\u2019t land well. Lesson learned move on. Everyone has a different sense of humour, it doesn\u2019t mean she is planning to cheat (was kinda funny tbf)", "My parents joke around like this, but it's not for every couple. They have been together for over 40 years at this point. New relationships don't have that sane level of trust and understanding. NAH.", "How is \u201crandom guy who likes me is someone I\u2019d like to sleep with\u201d laughing at his expense?", "Found the incel", "You know she didn't exactly cheat right? She just made a lame joke.", "She said he was \u201cdoable\u201d, meaning she would sleep with him", "She basically said the equivalent of a \u201cthat\u2019s what she said\u201d joke and he lost his shit. Definitely YTA.", "Yes I was asking questions. I didn't raise my voice but I was clearly upset. Maybe the questions I asked could have been abit mean.", "\"99% of the time jokes have a sliver of truth in them\" is just plain wrong first of all. Yes sometimes the truth is masked as a joke, but thinking it's 99% of the time is just dumb.\n\n\"no loyal partner makes those jokes\" You will miss out on a lot of amazing and loyal partners with that kind of immature thinking. Jokes are jokes, don't take it so hard.\n\nNow if your partner constantly jokes about cheating on you then yes you should be worried, but a single joke means absolutely nothing", "Found the 15 year old", "Silver of truth", "Thats bullshit", "assuming she was referring to a specific person who really was into her and it's someone who she finds attractive then definitely NTA.\n\nThat's textbook bullying and trying to get two guys competing for her attention.", "Your statement about 99% of jokes seems way out of proportion tbh.", "I make these jokes occasionally. Been in an amazing relationship for 3 years, not even considering cheating. It's a type of humor, you don't have to like it, but if you're taking it seriously, you're the problem.", "Can you give examples of how they were mean?", "Found the unloyal chick!", "Yes definitely. Probably the meanest was when I asked her if she likes the validation she gets from male attention because she always makes jokes about it and talk about it all the time.", "found the insecure loser!", "I'm a dude, kid...", "Lol, I intend this in the best possible manner, but you're a softy if this is the worst \ud83d\ude05... \n\nHaving said that, even though joking about cheating doesn't necessarily mean she was thinking about cheating, it does paint a different picture about her. \n\nAt best, she is dumb and doesn't think about the impact of what she's saying might have on the other person, especially being their SO, at worst it shows a clear disconnect between your and her core values.", "You're too soft"]}
