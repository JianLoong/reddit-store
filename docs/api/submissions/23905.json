{"id": 23905, "submission_id": "15ii9su", "title": "AITA for telling my aunt I\u2019m not sharing a bed?", "selftext": "My aunt tried forcing me to share my bed and I refused to do so.\n\nLittle backstory, I (14M) went on vacation with my family (my mom, dad, and nephew). My mom had rented an airbnb, and we had been staying there for four days. My aunt had came to stay along with my sister, which I was aware of. Since they had gotten there though, my aunt kept insisting I share the beds which mind you are twin size, maybe a tad smaller. The morning after she got there, she scooted me to the side of the bed saying \u201cLook we can both fit\u201d. After I said I still would not be sharing the bed with her, she started talking about me sharing the bed with my sisters boyfriends, or even suggesting I sleep on a blowup mattress. Later on when my other siblings and cousins arrived she kept on insisting I share a bed, despite me saying no multiple times. That night, once we started getting ready for bed she started telling me \u201cYou need to choose already who you\u2019re going to sleep with-\u201c. At that point I cut her off, as I was tired of her hearing about it. I told her hell no, and that I would not be sharing my bed whatsoever, I had been staying there for the past 4 days, and I\u2019m not going to move just for the one night. I told her my parents paid for the place, and paid for me to lay on a bed by myself, not with another man, or on a mattress in the living room. This made her extremely angry, she went upstairs going off about how I was spoiled and that i\u2019m not royalty, nor should I act like it.\n\nI went upstairs, to where my mom made me apologize, I said I was sorry for the way I responded, but that I wasn\u2019t sorry for my decision. She responded by saying that because I didn\u2019t let somebody on my bed, that I wasn\u2019t actually sorry.\n\nMy parents and nephew both support my decision and think she was out of line. \n\nMy honest take is that there was no reason for this whole situation, it\u2019s not like there wasn\u2019t any room for others to sleep, there were mattresses, spaces on the couch, we were doing fine. But even then, if she would\u2019ve just asked me politely  to share the bed, or to even sleep on a mattress, i would\u2019ve honestly considered it.\n\nOne more thing I don\u2019t understand was that, she didn\u2019t pay for the airbnb, so I don\u2019t understand why she was trying to kick me out of my own bed. If the roles were reversed, I wouldn\u2019t have even asked her, or any other people staying at that airbnb because I didn\u2019t pay for it and I didn\u2019t get there first.\n\nSo anyways reddit, am i the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691199071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ii9su/aita_for_telling_my_aunt_im_not_sharing_a_bed/", "score": 248, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she does it again sometime, explain that she is giving you creepy vibes.", "Some reeeeeal fucking shifty behaviour from a grown adult to a teenager.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s extremely inappropriate for your aunt to suggest you share a bed, and then try to manipulate you into giving up the bed for her sake by forcing herself into the bed! It is not ok for a non-parent adult to share a bed with a teenager. Yes she\u2019s your aunt, but you\u2019re 14 years old and that is definitely old enough to deserve your own dang bed. If I was your mom, I would be like WTF that\u2019s weird and creepy of my (sister? Sis in law?) to force themselves into sharing a bed with my kid!! Your aunt should have made sure she had her own bed for the night and used one of the options that you said were available like the air mattress, but she made it your problem. \nAlso, there\u2019s so many ways your parents should have been in your corner for this situation, and it isn\u2019t fair to you. Your aunt was forceful and made you uncomfortable and that is not okay.", "NTA it's so beyond weird that she wanted you to share a bed with someone even though there was enough space for everyone. Why?? Is it a power trip? I don't get it.", "NTA. Your aunt is creepy af for wanting to sleep in a twin bed with a teenage boy. This is not safe behavior. Never be alone with her", "99% NTA.\n\nYour aunt is very clearly the main culprit of assholery here. Funnily enough, she was criticizing *you* for \"acting spoiled like royalty,\" when *she's* the one demanding other people to get off *their* asses for *hers.* I can only make assumptions here, but it sounds like she just couldn't bare the thought of sleeping anywhere that wasn't of the utmost quality for even just a day, which if true, says everything you need to know about her.\n\nI am curious though; did you get the higher quality bed between you and your nephew? Cause if both your guys' beds were of equal quality, then she should've just asked to sleep with her son (who I assume is your nephew). Also, what does she mean by \"You need to choose already who you're going to sleep with-\"? According to you, there's plenty of free space for her (or whoever it is you would've chosen lol) to occupy, so coupling up doesn't really even sound necessary.\n\nHowever, you *are* 1% an asshole for trying to use your parents' money to justify entitlement to anything. I get that it was a \"spur-of-the-moment\" response to her *initially* hostile request though (as well as there being plenty of room), but that would've been quite disrespectful to say if you guys really were staying in a cramped space.\n\nHere's a couple things I was confused about:\n\n* Why did your mom try to pull a \"gotcha\" on you? You very clearly expressed that you were sorry for your tone of voice, but adamantly clarified otherwise in regards to your decision. Was she trying to suggest that you weren't really sorry for your aggressive demeanor *because* you followed through with the decision that you *said* you were gonna follow through with? If so, how exactly does that make any sense?\n* What do you mean by \"sisters boyfriends\"? Are you saying that your sister has multiple male friends; maybe even a harem? - or do you have multiple sisters who each have a boyfriend (or harems of their own)?\n\nPunctuation is important, my friend's.", "Well, NTA but I can see where your aunt is coming from. She's older and I can tell you from experience that past like 30yo your body is gonna be hell after sleeping on a couch or inflatable mattress, you don't know how lucky you've got it.\n\nAs for how she asked you, there's not enough info about the family dynamic like if your aunt is an authoritative figure in the family or if bed sharing is common (often is in poorer families, I'm fine with it personally).", "Not the a hole. Sounds like she was trying to manipulate you into doing what she wanted.", "In my family the beds are assigned by age, couples, siblings. And twin beds are never shared. Who paid for it does not matter. \n\nSo assuming no grandparents. \nYour parents get first two person bed, then beds go to adults off their generation to maximize people in beds. Then kids by age. \n\nSo in my family, YTA.  And getting an air mattress out a couch is all you could expect.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Rather you have that boundary for a similar reason or not, it is a boundary. As well as personal opinion a healthy one. If a person can't pay for their own bed they should not go.

I used to work at a school and one thing we very much tried to tell children was that you have absolutely should be treated like a fellow human being, but beware anyone who tries to treat you like an adult when you're still a kid. They are trying to get something in a way that you won't tell other adults about it. \n\nFor future dealings, a better way to handle something like this is \"Have you said anything about this to my parents?\" or \"This sounds like a conversation you really need to have with my parents\" and let them know that you don't feel comfortable with the whole thing.
