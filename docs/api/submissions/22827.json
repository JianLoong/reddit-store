She's responsible for her own decisions.  Ditch her as a friend.", "NTA \n\nSo if you were responsible for her getting an uber then so were all those friends, right?", "No one else texting you could give this woman a ride? Then they should step off. She made a choice- a ride or drugs and she chose. Good for you for sticking to your decision. Why do you want a friend that treats you (and your car) like this?", "NTA are you kidding me. Eff this friend.", "NTA\n\nEx-friend and flying monkeys get blocked.  Distance yourself from her / you're on a very different path.  One that doesn't include jail time, bail money, and dangerous situations.  If you allow it, she will take you down with her.  (ps. She called an Uber, ex-friend can take care of herself when forced to.)\n\nSpeaking as that one friend who walked away from budding drug addict friends.  Saw them decades later and thought, \"Damn.  Bad choices = bad outcomes.\"  \n\n(Edited for clarity.)", "NTA. It sounds like your friend put you in a really difficult situation and didn't respect your boundaries. You did the right thing by setting clear boundaries and refusing to drive her back when she clearly didn't want to follow them. It's also not okay for anyone to call you names or spit in your car. You deserve better than that kind of treatment from a friend.", "NTA.\n\nThere's no question you were trying to do the right thing. You didn't abandon your friend - she had a clear chance to get back in the car if she stopped putting you at risk. But she and the friends angry at you are manipulative and blame you for not letting her put you at risk. You need new friends", "NTA, and I'd never give her a ride again if I were you. You're the one who would be in a shit-ton of trouble if you had been pulled over with her in the car and she had that stuff on her. \n\nAnd remind all of your other \"friends\" that an Uber is far cheaper than a DUI or even a funeral.", "NTA\n\nYears ago, when pot was illegal, I discovered a friend had weed on him *as we were getting pulled over.*  He showed us a 1/2 ounce bag and was freaking out. \n\nThis was after I asked him to never do this kind of thing.  My car was off limits to drugs etc...  \n\nWhile the cop was behind us and before I pulled over, I became furious & went from Jekyll to Hyde in a heartbeat. I dont know how many details I can provide here under concerns of violating subreddit rules but lets just say my threats carried enough venom and credible promises of violence.  I was so angry to be in this scenario & I wasnt going down for him.  \n\nI demanded he eat all of it *now*.  He protested and I threw a soda bottle at him to help him stuff it all down.  Which he did.  After the cop left he tried to protest again and how I owed him for the amount of weed he had to eat.\n\nI told him he doesnt get to speak any longer and is lucky Im not leaving him by the side of the highway.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  You can law down ground rules to passengers when its your car.  When someone brings contraband into your vehicle, if caught, you are complicit and will be up shit's creek without a paddle.  NTA", "NTA. She's old enough to know the difference of what is right and wrong and she cannot expect that someone is going to join in her shenanigans. You could get in trouble you are right and you shouldn't be held responsible for her stupid life decisions. She should not also expect to get high or fucked up and have someone take care of her to make sure she is groovy. As for those other people they will understand maybe one day that you are making sure you are set up for success and not dragged by other people because they don't know who to make good decisions.", "You\u2019re an asshole lol", "NTA. You are responsible for your choices, just as she is.\n\n>The next day my phone is filled with people calling me the asshole for not driving my friend back and letting a high and drugged woman get an Uber.\n\nWho got her high?

She isn't one.", "Honestly", "This is also the person who when they hear, \"Act natural.\" They sit ramrod straight, with eyes darting everywhere.", "Ecstasy is though.", "There\u2019s still laws around transporting medical and recreational, akin to alcohol and open container laws.\n\nI\u2019m gonna guess it\u2019s not legal recreationally since she stashed it in her bra, and had ecstasy which is a schedule 1 possession charge, probably misdemeanor but idk how much of that is needed to be a felony.\n\nAbsolutely NTA even if the weed was recreational. Boundaries are boundaries are boundaries.", "OP\u2019s car, OP\u2019s rules.", "Nah, Op can do as they like. Friend is a huge asshole. Just like you", "Yes I\u2019ll happily risk going to jail to avoid being the asshole", "Here in NYC weed is the same thing as your cell phone. Like you can even light up in the street here. Abandoning your friend for a legal commodity that you didn\u2019t tell them before hand you had a problem with would definitely make you an asshole. \n\nBut I understand not everyone gets to live in a place as glorious as this, so if you live in a shithole where it\u2019s still a problem you have to look out for yourself. \n\nSo it very much depends on where you live.", "Lets start with what century you live in? Then add what country?\nIf US cannabis is legal in like 43 states. Its been proven to kill cancer and stop seizures yet you speak of it as you were the son of Harry Anslinger.Its a plant ffs and YTA for allowing a supposed friend, under the influence of anything, out of your site. PS tell your friend to smell (not snort) black pepper and she won't be so paranoid", "NTA\n\nThis person is not a friend.  Neither are the people harassing you.   \nShe put you at risk by having it.", "NTA.  But your friends are.  If it was so dangerous for her to ride-share home, then one of them could have driven her.  But they didn't, so I guess THEY didn't want to get caught with drugs in the car either.", "Your friends are AHs", "NTA\n\nTell her to move to Oregon.", "I assume it\u2019s illegal where you are. Doesn\u2019t really matter putting ex in the mix. You didn\u2019t make a stoned person get an Uber, she did. Chances are you would be ok being on her person but you were right not to take the chance.", "At first I read your title as \"because she had just urinated\" rather than \"because she had cannabis in her bra\" and I was a bit confused but yeah, she doesn't really sound like your friend so NTA", "Ditto, except my friend actually spent several weekends in jail (allowed to be out during the week to work).", "*CANDY BARS*", "Ain't no way this mf ate a half oz of weed cap", "Aww I love Texas and one day hope to move back \ud83d\ude2d", "Did we find the friend?? OP is NTA.", "I've seen dudes do stupider, for less reason than threat of legal trouble. He tossed the dude a soda - you can totally eat 14gs of dry flower with a drink. It won't get you high, and you'll probably puke, but frat dudes do shit like that all the time lol", "Yeah but according to the story she already took the ecstasy, so that\u2019s gone. I\u2019d say after they took drugs is the worst time to abandon your friends on the side of the road.", "Legal doesn\u2019t mean OP needs to compromise on how they feel having any substance in their car. That\u2019s like bringing alcohol into someone\u2019s dry household. You don\u2019t sneak what you know you\u2019ve been told not to bring. Not when you actually respect your friends.", "Whoopsie I read over that cos (coincidentally) I just got done smoking. And you\u2019re definitely right about abandoning your friend who is in a drug induced stupor.", "If you don\u2019t tell them it\u2019s a dry household before hand how are they supposed to know?\n\nIf you have a problem with your friends having a legal commodity in your car you tell them before hand, not demand they throw it out after you\u2019ve already hit the road. Not when you actually respect your friends.", "Half a point conceded for no direct knowledge of a dry home, but the point still stands: when someone is sneaking in drugs (or booze), they knew better and the likelihood it was gonna be a no if they asked was pretty high.\n\nAs for the parallel I made to sneaking in booze, if you care about your friends and pay attention to what they say, you wouldn\u2019t need to be directly told. The signs are bright and shiny when someone has strong opinions about drugs and alcohol in their car or home. I have a feeling OP has had several many loud opinions about this kind of thing."]}
