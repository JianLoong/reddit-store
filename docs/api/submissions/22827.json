She's responsible for her own decisions.  Ditch her as a friend.", "NTA \n\nSo if you \"forced\" her to get an uber, then they all forced her too, right?", "No one else texting you could give this woman a ride? Then they should step off. She made a choice- a ride or drugs and she chose. Good for you for sticking to your decision. Why do you want a friend that treats you (and your car) like this?", "NTA are you kidding me. Eff this friend.", "NTA\n\nEx-friend and flying monkeys get blocked.  Distance yourself from her / you're on a very different path.  One that doesn't include jail time, bail money, and dangerous situations.  If you allow it, she will take you down with her.  (ps. She called an Uber, ex-friend can take care of herself when forced to.)\n\nSpeaking as that one friend who walked away from budding drug addict friends.  Saw them decades later and thought, \"Damn.  Bad choices = bad outcomes.\"  \n\n(Edited for clarity.)", "NTA. It sounds like your friend put you in a really difficult situation and didn't respect your boundaries. You did the right thing by setting clear boundaries and refusing to drive her back when she clearly didn't want to follow them. It's also not okay for anyone to call you names or spit in your car. You deserve better than that kind of treatment from a friend.", "NTA.\n\nThere's no question you were trying to do the right thing. You didn't abandon your friend - she had a clear chance to get back in the car if she stopped putting you at risk. But she and the friends angry at you are manipulative and blame you for not letting her put you at risk. You need new friends", "NTA, and I'd never give her a ride again if I were you. You're the one who would be in a shit-ton of trouble if you had been pulled over with her in the car and she had that stuff on her. \n\nAnd remind all of your other \"friends\" that an Uber is far cheaper than a DUI or even a funeral.", "NTA\n\nYears ago, when pot was illegal, I discovered a friend had weed on him *as we were getting pulled over.*  He showed us a 1/2 ounce bag and was freaking out. \n\nThis was after I asked him to never do this kind of thing.  My car was off limits to drugs etc...  \n\nWhile the cop was behind us and before I pulled over, I became furious & went from Jekyll to Hyde in a heartbeat. I dont know how many details I can provide here under concerns of violating subreddit rules but lets just say my threats carried enough venom and credible promises of violence.  I was so angry to be in this scenario & I wasnt going down for him.  \n\nI demanded he eat all of it *now*.  He protested and I threw a soda bottle at him to help him stuff it all down.  Which he did.  After the cop left he tried to protest again and how I owed him for the amount of weed he had to eat.\n\nI told him he doesnt get to speak any longer and is lucky Im not leaving him by the side of the highway.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.  You can law down ground rules to passengers when its your car.  When someone brings contraband into your vehicle, if caught, you are complicit and will be up shit's creek without a paddle.  NTA", "NTA. She's old enough to know the difference of what is right and wrong and she cannot expect that someone is going to join in her shenanigans. You could get in trouble you are right and you shouldn't be held responsible for her stupid life decisions. She should not also expect to get high or fucked up and have someone take care of her to make sure she is groovy. As for those other people they will understand maybe one day that you are making sure you are set up for success and not dragged by other people because they don't know who to make good decisions.", "You\u2019re an asshole lol", "NTA. You are responsible for your choices, just as she is.\n\n>The next day my phone is filled with people calling me the asshole for not driving my friend back and letting a high and drugged woman get an Uber.\n\nWho got her high? Where were they when she wanted a chauffeur?", "NTA. You need to choose better friends. That person isn't one.", "NTA, you need better friends. She isn't one.", "Honestly", "This is also the person who when they hear, \"Act natural.\" They sit ramrod straight, with eyes darting everywhere.", "Ecstasy is though.", "There\u2019s still laws around transporting medical and recreational, akin to alcohol and open container laws.\n\nI\u2019m gonna guess it\u2019s not legal recreationally since she stashed it in her bra, and had ecstasy which is a schedule 1 possession charge, probably misdemeanor but idk how much of that is needed to be a felony.\n\nAbsolutely NTA even if the weed was recreational. Boundaries are boundaries are boundaries.", "OP\u2019s car, OP\u2019s rules.", "Nah, Op can do as they like. Friend is a huge asshole. Just like you", "Yes I\u2019ll happily risk going to jail to avoid being the asshole", "Here in NYC weed is the same thing as your cell phone. Abandoning your friend for a legal commodity that you didn\u2019t tell them before hand you had a problem with would definitely make you an asshole. \n\nBut I understand not everyone gets to live in a place as glorious as this, so if you live in a shithole where it\u2019s still a problem you have to look out for yourself. \n\nSo it very much depends on where you live."]}
