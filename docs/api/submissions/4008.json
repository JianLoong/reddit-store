{"id": 4008, "submission_id": "zd6inh", "title": "AITA for forbidding my girlfriend to use my kitchen equipment?", "selftext": "So I'm gonna try and make this as short as possible.\n\nThe problem started when my girlfriend moved in about two years ago.\n\nI'm a former professional chef with a great passion for food. Over the years, I've gotten myself a lot of kitchen equipment that's quite expensive (if it breaks I won't be able to replace it for at least a couple of months) that I take care of as if it's my little babies. I have knives, pot and pans that I've kept in pristine condition despite using some of them **a lot** for 10 years or more.\n\nI also have a bunch of cheap, low quality equipment in my kitchen that I call my shit pans. When she moved in she asked me about them and why I didn't throw them out and I jokingly told her that I keep them in case I have people that I don't trust in my kitchen.\n\nSome time after she moved in with me, I started noticing scratches in non stick pans, dents on knife edges and deformations in pots. I started observing my girlfriend when she was cooking and saw her cutting stuff with one of my japanese chef knives directly on top of the stainless steel counter and told her right away to use a cutting board. I've seen that when she's done with a pan, she puts in under running water to cool it down. She uses dishwashing soap in my cast iron pans and the list goes on. I've told her multiple times how to take care of the equipment and what/what not to do, and pretty much every time I correct her she gets annoyed.\n\nSo last week I came home and to my horror I saw my 5 liter cast iron pot filled up with water that had dishwasher soap in it. It's one of my favorite pots that I've seasoned over the course of 15 years. I snapped and told my girlfriend that she's not allowed to use my expensive equipment anymore and showed her the \"shit pans\" and told her that those are the ones she's gonna have to use in the future.\n\nShe thought I overreacted but I refused to budge. I'm getting tired of resharpening knives every other day and having to throw out pans that I've inherited from generations back because they got deformed or rusted beyond restoration.\n\nShe reminded me of how I said the \"shit pans\" was for people I don't trust and questioned whether I trust her or not, which I do, just not with my kitchen equipment.\n\nSo please enlighten me, am I the asshole for banning my girlfriend from using my kitchen equipment?  \n\n\n**EDIT:**   \n**Just gonna put this here to avoid more posts about the same thing:**  \n**People have pointed out that soap in cast iron pans is in fact ok and I'm not gonna argue against that. It's just what I've been taught both from older relatives and in culinary school so it's never really been something I've questioned. I'm gonna do some reading about the matter.**  \n\n\n**However, it doesn't really take away the fact that soaking cast iron in water causes it to rust. But that's also not really the biggest issue I've had either. What has caused the most unrestorable and expensive damage to my equipment has been the rinsing of hot pans under cold water, which has caused several pans to deform and rendered them basically useless for anything other than boiling water.**", "created_utc": 1670246186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd6inh/aita_for_forbidding_my_girlfriend_to_use_my/", "score": 5411, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Agree with this comment that if this is the only issue, maybe some additional education is worth the effort.

I have my mom's old Farberware stainless that would lead someone to think cookware is indestructible but also nothing special as it heats ok, but not at all like my All Clad. Maybe she's under the impression you're picky, when in truth, quality items come with detailed care instruction that matter.", "Well, now that you mention it, I have a pretty decent network in the culinary business in Sweden and I'm gonna make some calls after work today and see if I can hook-up some cooking class with a famous chef I used to work with, as a christmas gift that she can bring a friend or two to go on. Of course, with a high focus on how to use the equipment properly haha.

It's ultimately up to the OP and his girlfriend to communicate and find a solution that works for both of them.", "I understand where you're coming from about protecting your valuable belongings, but in a relationship, it's important to have open communication and compromise.

You can get a jumpstart on the process with new* cast iron pans by slathering them in a highly unsaturated fat and sticking them in a high temp oven to polymerize the oil several times. Once they're seasoned, cast iron pans are honestly wonderful, but before that, they're a pain to cook with, and if you strip the seasoning off an old cast iron pan that a chef has been building for a long time, said chef may well end you.
