Over the years, I've gotten myself a lot of kitchen equipment that's quite expensive (if it breaks I won't be able to replace it for at least a couple of months) that I take care of as if it's my little babies. I have knives, pot and pans that I've kept in pristine condition despite using some of them **a lot** for 10 years or more.\n\nI also have a bunch of cheap, low quality equipment in my kitchen that I call my shit pans. When she moved in she asked me about them and why I didn't throw them out and I jokingly told her that I keep them in case I have people that I don't trust in my kitchen.\n\nSome time after she moved in with me, I started noticing scratches in non stick pans, dents on knife edges and deformations in pots. I started observing my girlfriend when she was cooking and saw her cutting stuff with one of my japanese chef knives directly on top of the stainless steel counter and told her right away to use a cutting board. I've seen that when she's done with a pan, she puts in under running water to cool it down. She uses dishwashing soap in my cast iron pans and the list goes on. I've told her multiple times how to take care of the equipment and what/what not to do, and pretty much every time I correct her she gets annoyed.\n\nSo last week I came home and to my horror I saw my 5 liter cast iron pot filled up with water that had dishwasher soap in it. It's one of my favorite pots that I've seasoned over the course of 15 years. I snapped and told my girlfriend that she's not allowed to use my expensive equipment anymore and showed her the \"shit pans\" and told her that those are the ones she's gonna have to use in the future.\n\nShe thought I overreacted but I refused to budge. I'm getting tired of resharpening knives every other day and having to throw out pans that I've inherited from generations back because they got deformed or rusted beyond restoration.\n\nShe reminded me of how I said the \"shit pans\" was for people I don't trust and questioned whether I trust her or not, which I do, just not with my kitchen equipment.\n\nSo please enlighten me, am I the asshole for banning my girlfriend from using my kitchen equipment?", "created_utc": 1670246186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd6inh/aita_for_forbidding_my_girlfriend_to_use_my/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mother was a chef and if I did that I'd be off to the hospital with a cast iron skillet shaped dent in my head. \n\nShe does not understand the cost, nor how to treat expensive cooking gear. \n\nIt may be worth trying to show and explain that this stuff is expensive and you can't just treat it like some cheap knives off the shelf or aluminum pans from a supermarket. Might inspire a little more respect for your equipment.", "NTA. It's not even about her cooking correctly or using the shit pans, in the end - you set a reasonable boundary for some possessions that you care about and use a great deal, and she refused to respect it. Anyone would get mad. \n\nIf she's a generally decent person besides this, I'd try one real sincere conversation to let her know how much it means to you to have these kitchen things used correctly, and if she refuses to listen, that says a lot about her character.", "I'm gonna say NTA. I am the same as you - I am a one-woman-army in the kitchen and I have some expensive knives and equipment that I've been gifted over the years. I learned how to take good care of them all. I do 99% of the cooking in my house and my husband used to also accidentally mess up my stuff when he did. I told him to either do the right things to clean them or to just leave it if he forgets how and I'll take care of it.\n\nYou explained how to properly clean and care for your stuff and she isn't doing it, and on top of that, she's getting visibly annoyed when you remind her. She doesn't care about the stuff that you *clearly* do.\n\nPlus, it's not like you gave her no alternative, there are pots and pans and knives she can still use.\n\nI think it's fine to have stuff that's just your own, for whatever reasons you want to have them.

Modern dish soap doesn\u2019t have any lye so it\u2019s generally safe as long as the pot is thoroughly dried before you put it away (i often dry in a slow oven to be sure) However, you should not soak it in water the way she is for sure. The point is that she is not respecting your kitchen equipment and deserves to lose privileges there", "Throw out the shit pans, and gift her her own set of non shit, non professional cookware and knives.  Nice stuff, but not too nice.  Give them the top priority storage spots and move yours to the less desirable location.  She can be happy, and you don\u2019t have to watch your stuff be destroyed.

It's understandable that you're passionate about your kitchen equipment and want to protect it, but you can't just forbid your girlfriend from using it.

Agree with this comment that if this is the only issue, maybe some additional education is worth the effort. I have some cookware and equipment that is sacrosanct too, and took me years of searching and saving to acquire. I'm wondering if watching some videos on proper culinary cookware and care, along with some googling of their cost, would make more of an impression on her. I have my mom's old Farberware stainless that would lead someone to think cookware is indestructible but also nothing special as it heats ok, but not at all like my All Clad. Maybe she's under the impression you're picky, when in truth, quality items come with detailed care instruction that matter.", "Well, now that you mention it, I have a pretty decent network in the culinary business in Sweden and I'm gonna make some calls after work today and see if I can hook-up some cooking class with a famous chef I used to work with, as a christmas gift that she can bring a friend or two to go on. Of course, with a high focus on how to use the equipment properly haha. Maybe it's easier if she gets the info from someone that isn't me, and maybe that might actually make her respect my competence more, as I've always been \"the construction worker\" and not \"the chef\" for all the time we've known eachother.", "I don't know haha, maybe save up and get myself one of those gun lockers and place it in.   \n\n\nIn her defense, she has gotten much better since the beginning but it's still not good enough to not cause damage to the equipment. Sometimes she catches herself doing something she shouldn't and goes \"oh no that's the thing i wasn't supposed to do\" but my problem is that the damage is often already done at that point. I've told her that I'm happy that she's trying but that there's no room for oopsies when the oopsie means you destroy a \\~$500 frying pan that I saved up for months to be able to afford.", "I'm pretty sure he knows this. But loosing a decade and a half of seasoning hurts like a bitch.", "The problem with dishwasher soap is that it dissolves fat, which ruins the non-stick properties of the accumulated buildup of fat in the pan. The pan might not be destroyed to a point where it can't be used but it sure won't be the same pan for a good while.", "That seems quite reasonable. I'm thinking I might've somewhat set her up for failure by mostly providing equipment that's unsuited for someone that don't really know how to get the worth out of them in the first place. Can't really afford an entire set right now but I'll order a frying pan right away. Thanks for the input.", "Yeah from the start I was probably just dumb enough to assume that everyone knew how to treat kitchen equipment properly, so it's been **a lot** of \"next time please do this instead\":s. I would be unfair if I said that she hasn't tried to improve but she keeps forgetting and often realizes her mistakes **after** she's done them.  \n\n\nAbout the cutting on the counter-top she says she's always done that and I mean, I've seen the state that her own equipment was in before she moved in with me and I believe her lol. That particular thing she's only done once that I know of but I have found my knives in the sink with the rest of the dishes many times, as well as metal utensils soaked in water inside non-stick pans (\"I thought I would save some water, sorry I forgot\").  \n\n\nMaybe I'll reintroduce her to the equipment one piece at a time, with a small lesson on how it's used properly for every single one, to avoid the \"too much info at once\" problem. I really want her to be able to use my stuff but I'm so tired of seeing it get damaged from misuse.", "No. High quality kitchen utensils in the hands of someone who won\u2019t learn how to use them mandates a ban.

My instinct here would be to tell her \" hey, I'm attached to this pan and means a lot to me,\" but that might not be your bag.", "No.", "I'd give it some time before you do this. Sounds like a great gift, but it's sure to back fire now (would've been good before telling her not to use the equipment).", "Send her a bill.", "It sounds like you guys love each other, she\u2019s just not up to the level of a professional chef when it comes to keeping the tools in top shape. May I suggest \u201cculinary school\u201d date nights where you teach her how to create a professional level chef meal with extra attention on how to properly use the knives and pots? As a teacher I learn it\u2019s best to model anything first so students understand the expectations. \n\nIt sounds like she\u2019s trying, and may be a bit sad because you relegated her to the pots used for people you don\u2019t trust\u2014 but you\u2019re right to do this\u2014 if you\u2019re also taking time to carefully teach her. It takes a while to undo years of doing whatever you want to cheap pots. Good luck!", "Sounds like a good way to save money would be to get a new GF.", "I completely understand your concerns and they are valid, but since you seem to want to build a life with her, maybe find some compromises. You mentioned cooking classes in the comments and I think that's an awesome idea. If you think it'd be too tense for you teach her, maybe find a neutral third party who can run through the basics with her and make it fun. Plenty of people just aren't taught this stuff and have to figure it out on their own and it's possible she's just very uneducated on it and not willfully trying to destroy your stuff. I'm a clutsy mess and there has been a lot of trial and error over the years. I still melt every utentil that comes near my stove, so I've told everyone in my life to NOT get me good spatulas, lol.", "Yes, OP did have conversations with their girlfriend about how to properly take care of the kitchen equipment. But just because they had the conversation doesn't mean it's okay to forbid their girlfriend from using the equipment. It's still a form of control and not a healthy way to handle the situation. Instead, they should continue to have open and honest discussions about the issue and come up with a solution together, rather than just imposing a ban.", "That\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve got shit pans and shit knives too. I also have a shit box where I put stuff I dunno what to do with. I get it from my mom - She has a whole host of shit pans that have their own cabinet and everything.", "I agree. I also think the lessons on how to use the pots ands knives should have come before she ever touched them. Some people are clueless about expensive tools and need intensive lessons.", "It's control because he tried talking to her already and she still won't take adept care of his cooking equipment and decided to ban her from using them? Do you hear yourself?", "And if girlfriend refuses to discuss or participate in a solution as she has to date? What then?\n\nIt is not 'a form of control' to defend your valued and valuable belongings against  wilful misuse.", "The compromise is that there are pans for her to use that aren\u2019t expensive and don\u2019t need special care. They had the conversation and he gave her a compromise. It\u2019s her choice to accept it or not.", "Did you just read what you wrote?", "I understand your concern about the girlfriend not wanting to discuss or participate in finding a solution. In that case, I think it's important for the OP to have a serious conversation with her about the issue and explain why it's important to him and how it's affecting their relationship. If she still refuses to cooperate, then it may be necessary for the OP to reevaluate the relationship and consider whether it's worth continuing if they can't come to a compromise on something as important as kitchen equipment.\n\nBanning her from using the equipment may not be the best solution, but it's understandable why the OP would feel frustrated if his attempts to discuss the issue were met with resistance. It's ultimately up to the OP and his girlfriend to communicate and find a solution that works for both of them.", "I understand where you're coming from about protecting your valuable belongings, but in a relationship, it's important to have open communication and compromise. If your girlfriend refuses to discuss or participate in finding a solution, then perhaps it's time to reevaluate the relationship and whether or not it's healthy for both parties. Banning her from using your kitchen equipment without trying to find a solution together is not a healthy way to handle the situation.", "Alright bro, you can go talk to whoever 50 times in a row while they disrespect your stuff and we'll actually take care of it while you sit and cry, thanks !", "But he already tried to find a solution with communication and she has already *repeatedly* refused to listen, while telling her she can't use the pans *does* communicate that they are important to him and that her actions are negatively affecting him. Quite clearly.\n\nShe shouldn't need another serious conversation to respect simple requests about his valuable things.\n\nSo your preference is that he dump her rather than tell her to use the cheap pans, but you'd call the cheap pans option the AH move out of those two. Doesn't make a lot of sense."]}
