Over the years, I've gotten myself a lot of kitchen equipment that's quite expensive (if it breaks I won't be able to replace it for at least a couple of months) that I take care of as if it's my little babies. I have knives, pot and pans that I've kept in pristine condition despite using some of them **a lot** for 10 years or more.\n\nI also have a bunch of cheap, low quality equipment in my kitchen that I call my shit pans. When she moved in she asked me about them and why I didn't throw them out and I jokingly told her that I keep them in case I have people that I don't trust in my kitchen.\n\nSome time after she moved in with me, I started noticing scratches in non stick pans, dents on knife edges and deformations in pots. I started observing my girlfriend when she was cooking and saw her cutting stuff with one of my japanese chef knives directly on top of the stainless steel counter and told her right away to use a cutting board. I've seen that when she's done with a pan, she puts in under running water to cool it down. She uses dishwashing soap in my cast iron pans and the list goes on. I've told her multiple times how to take care of the equipment and what/what not to do, and pretty much every time I correct her she gets annoyed.\n\nSo last week I came home and to my horror I saw my 5 liter cast iron pot filled up with water that had dishwasher soap in it. It's one of my favorite pots that I've seasoned over the course of 15 years. I snapped and told my girlfriend that she's not allowed to use my expensive equipment anymore and showed her the \"shit pans\" and told her that those are the ones she's gonna have to use in the future.\n\nShe thought I overreacted but I refused to budge. I'm getting tired of resharpening knives every other day and having to throw out pans that I've inherited from generations back because they got deformed or rusted beyond restoration.\n\nShe reminded me of how I said the \"shit pans\" was for people I don't trust and questioned whether I trust her or not, which I do, just not with my kitchen equipment.\n\nSo please enlighten me, am I the asshole for banning my girlfriend from using my kitchen equipment?", "created_utc": 1670246186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zd6inh/aita_for_forbidding_my_girlfriend_to_use_my/", "score": 434, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am the same as you - I am a one-woman-army in the kitchen and I have some expensive knives and equipment that I've been gifted over the years. I learned how to take good care of them all. I do 99% of the cooking in my house and my husband used to also accidentally mess up my stuff when he did. I told him to either do the right things to clean them or to just leave it if he forgets how and I'll take care of it.\n\nYou explained how to properly clean and care for your stuff and she isn't doing it, and on top of that, she's getting visibly annoyed when you remind her. She doesn't care about the stuff that you *clearly* do.\n\nPlus, it's not like you gave her no alternative, there are pots and pans and knives she can still use.\n\nI think it's fine to have stuff that's just your own, for whatever reasons you want to have them.

Modern dish soap doesn\u2019t have any lye so it\u2019s generally safe as long as the pot is thoroughly dried before you put it away (i often dry in a slow oven to be sure) However, you should not soak it in water the way she is for sure. The point is that she is not respecting your kitchen equipment and deserves to lose privileges there", "Throw out the shit pans, and gift her her own set of non shit, non professional cookware and knives.

Agree with this comment that if this is the only issue, maybe some additional education is worth the effort. I have some cookware and equipment that is sacrosanct too, and took me years of searching and saving to acquire. I'm wondering if watching some videos on proper culinary cookware and care, along with some googling of their cost, would make more of an impression on her. I have my mom's old Farberware stainless that would lead someone to think cookware is indestructible but also nothing special as it heats ok, but not at all like my All Clad. Maybe she's under the impression you're picky, when in truth, quality items come with detailed care instruction that matter.", "Well, now that you mention it, I have a pretty decent network in the culinary business in Sweden and I'm gonna make some calls after work today and see if I can hook-up some cooking class with a famous chef I used to work with, as a christmas gift that she can bring a friend or two to go on. Of course, with a high focus on how to use the equipment properly haha. Maybe it's easier if she gets the info from someone that isn't me, and maybe that might actually make her respect my competence more, as I've always been \"the construction worker\" and not \"the chef\" for all the time we've known eachother.", "I don't know haha, maybe save up and get myself one of those gun lockers and place it in.   \n\n\nIn her defense, she has gotten much better since the beginning but it's still not good enough to not cause damage to the equipment. Sometimes she catches herself doing something she shouldn't and goes \"oh no that's the thing i wasn't supposed to do\" but my problem is that the damage is often already done at that point.

I'm thinking I might've somewhat set her up for failure by mostly providing equipment that's unsuited for someone that don't really know how to get the worth out of them in the first place.

I would be unfair if I said that she hasn't tried to improve but she keeps forgetting and often realizes her mistakes **after** she's done them.  \n\n\nAbout the cutting on the counter-top she says she's always done that and I mean, I've seen the state that her own equipment was in before she moved in with me and I believe her lol. That particular thing she's only done once that I know of but I have found my knives in the sink with the rest of the dishes many times, as well as metal utensils soaked in water inside non-stick pans (\"I thought I would save some water, sorry I forgot\").  \n\n\nMaybe I'll reintroduce her to the equipment one piece at a time, with a small lesson on how it's used properly for every single one, to avoid the \"too much info at once\" problem.

It's ultimately up to the OP and his girlfriend to communicate and find a solution that works for both of them.", "I understand where you're coming from about protecting your valuable belongings, but in a relationship, it's important to have open communication and compromise.

(Ok, sometimes he cringes.)\n\nWe started with \u201cthe frying pan of relationship harmony\u201d in the early days of our relationship. A cheap \u00a37 non-stick, dishwasher friendly pan that I\u2019m happy to use. \n\nI still don\u2019t really understand what I do wrong that makes his cast iron frying pan go black in the \u201cwrong way\u201d. Mostly because I don\u2019t care enough to understand. It\u2019s not important to me. And I have my lovely Frying Pan Of Relationship Harmony, so I don\u2019t need to understand. \n\nWe also have \u201chis & hers\u201d sides to the knife block. \n\nAnd he does most of the hand washing-up, since pretty much all of the \u201ctoo nice for dishwasher\u201d stuff in the kitchen is for his happiness. \n\nSo having separate stuff is fine. It can be a positive thing. \n\nBut make it something cute & nice & a shared piece of humour / joy. \n\nIf she feels like a failure every time she has to use the \u201cshit pans\u201d (because she is a \u201cshit person\u201d who is being punished for how shit she is) then it will do your relationship no good.\n\nETA: and be careful about a judgemental attitude creeping in. This is NOT about you being right, and her being wrong. This is about you having one set of priorities, and her having a different set. Both are morally neutral - until you start insisting everyone changes their priorities to match yours. \n\nWhen my SO was critical & judgy about his \u201csuper special kitchen shit\u201d then I did not feel loving towards him, or particularly interested in putting any effort into solving the problem. \n\nHaving the same conversations but coming to them as equals, when you aren\u2019t judging her but instead fully accepting that her views on kitchen priorities are completely & equally valid to yours, and she is not required to share yours\u2026 then you\u2019ll start to get somewhere in figuring out a compromise. You can both respect each other\u2019s priorities without adopting them. \n\nI see mention in your other comments about \u201callowing\u201d her to use them again eventually.
