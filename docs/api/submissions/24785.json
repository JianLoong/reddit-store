We are getting married in 3 weeks and I already have the guest list finalized and I have already started telling vendors the headcounts. \n\nYesterday my fianc\u00e9 comes to me to ask if we can add another 4 people to our guest list, one of which being his former crush from high school/college that he pined after. She never wanted anything to do with him in that way. I know they have hooked up in the past and I honestly don\u2019t care whatever he did before meeting me. The issue is, that while we were dating exclusively they were very flirty on Snapchat a few years ago and I found out about it. He put a stop to it and hasn\u2019t spoken to her much in the last few years. \n\nDuring his bachelor trip last weekend, this girl reaches out to my fianc\u00e9 and is wanting to catch up on the past few years. He tells her that she is invited to the wedding along with her best friend from high school and their plus ones. Am I the asshole for not wanting her there? \n\nHe is making me feel like I am being childish by not wanting her there on or wedding day because they haven\u2019t been physical while we were dating, but I just don\u2019t feel like I can fully relax and enjoy the wedding with her presence in the room. It might be a self esteem issue with me, but I feel so self conscious knowing the girl he pined after a long time ago is there when I really want his attention directed towards me on our wedding day. I\u2019m not inviting any past lovers out of respect to my fianc\u00e9 and I wish he would do the same. \n\nPlease tell me if I am being childish and immature about this situation. I know in my heart he would never physically cheat on me. I\u2019ve worked really hard to get past his behavior from a few years ago when he was flirting with her on Snapchat and I thought we were in a really great place until he mentioned this. It just brings a lot of past feelings back up for me.", "created_utc": 1692186318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15snl9y/aita_for_vetoing_my_fianc\u00e9s_ex_crush_to_our/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You might not have mentioned Biggis Dickus before, but he's Roman and he is bursting to come to your wedding.", "NTA and not childish either.\n\nThis is your wedding, and if your fianc\u00e9's ex-crush makes you uncomfortable, she shouldn't be invited.\n\nNaturally, it will be his wedding too. However, if the presence of this ex-crush is more important to him than your comfort and full enjoyment of the wedding, that would be worrying in itself.", "NTA.\n\n>hasn\u2019t spoken to her much in the last few years. \n\nAlso taking into account their history, is that a sound basis for inviting her as well as\n\n>her best friend from high school and their plus ones\n\nHave you got any ex-boyfriends who can come with their friends?\n\n>I\u2019m not inviting any past lovers out of respect to my fianc\u00e9\n\nThat's a fairly typical way to approach your wedding.

So why does he want her there? NTA", "NTA for many reasons.\n\nFor one, you\u2019ve finalised your guest list and sent headcount\u2019s to venders. It\u2019s too late and they\u2019re clearly not that important if he didn\u2019t ask them until now. \n\nSecondly, no you don\u2019t get to just invite people you haven\u2019t spoken to in years to your wedding on a whim. \n\nYou aren\u2019t acting childish or immature.

That screeching sound is me mentally slamming on the brakes for you. BTW it\u2019s a more than a little suss that she decided they just had to get reacquainted when she found out he was getting married. Hold your ground on this, how hard he fights to have her there will tell you all you need to know.", "NTA your wedding is about both of you and what you want and what makes you comfortable. If he truly loves you, after you said no he wouldn\u2019t attack you for it and he would comply with it. I am sure his reaction is out of possible embarrassment telling her she isn\u2019t invited after all. You could advise him that he could let her know numbers are already in and it would significantly change things so he is unable to invite her and guest\u2019s however he would love for all of you to catch up at dinner after the honeymoon.", "NTA\n\nJust because he didn't physically cheat on you doesn't mean that he didn't cheat emotionally. He wants to invite a woman he was unfaithful with to your wedding, and *you're* the problem?\n\nPerhaps this isn't a wedding you should be going through with.", "NTA\n\nThere was zero reason to add these 4 people. Just tell fianc\u00e9 the headcount is finalized & it is just not possible.\n\nAs an event planner \u2014 I would sit his ass down & have a serious discussion about how ridiculous this request is. This person was an afterthought. There\u2019s no best friend relationship, there\u2019s no I just forgot, this is a straight up bullshit move. The Snapchat thing ended this \u201cfriendship\u201d & this guest is no longer welcome to share in this celebration.\n\neta \u2014 there\u2019s a reason she reached out to him right now & it is not for a good reason.", "NTA.\n\nThere are scenarios where you would be childish and immature. For example if she was now the best man's GF or something like that. But this is obviously not the case and this person is clearly not someone who is an important part of your fiancee's life in any way. So I don't see why it's necessary for her to be at the wedding.

Does she even have a +1 to invite, or is that just for show? It's really not even about whether you have something to worry about, it's more the fact that he's being an ass about this. NTA", "NTA, and in such situation I'd be \"childish and immature\" enough to call off the entire wedding. It's your special day and his first priority should be you and your happiness and wellbeing, not the ex and whatever ex-related BS he is trying to pull (options range from making her jealous, or being nice to her by extending the invitation - also, what the actual F with inviting her friend?!). Smells of some unresolved feelings to me, hope to be mistaken.", "Why on earth would he think that this would be a good idea.

Exes (crushes, friends with benefits, lovers) do NOT belong at your wedding. Him inviting this chick & her bestie without checking with you first is wrong. The guest list is something you both should've worked on together equally, not this stunt he pulled.

It will cause a lot of issues trying to increase your headcount at the last minute, and there's no guarantee it can be done without additional expenses.  \n\nLet him know you're happy to get together with them after the wedding to catch up, but they can't be added to the wedding guest list at the last minute like this.", "NTA. It sounds like he is making an effort to look good in front of her at your expense. Her good opinion of him is more valuable to him then yours. It may be because of residual feelings or an ego boost as now that he is taken she is acting interested, or he would like to keep a flirty relationship, or worst case he still wants her and is settling for you. Many possiblities, all quite disrespectful to you.", "NTA, he's out of line on this one, but if he's going to be like this maybe invite your hottest ex or hire a hot model and invite them as your ex", "NTA-  the timing of catching up does not convey good intentions.\n\nYou and your feelings should be prioritized after that flirting.

Our RSVP deadline was August 1st. Deadlines are deadlines for a reason.", "To show her what she missed on.", "I would be absolutely fine with meeting her after the wedding.

I\u2019m not so much worried about her than I am with his disrespect towards me.", "I thought it was sketchy as well. I read the text conversation with them and it wasn\u2019t flirty or anything, just odd that she reached out then after not talking for 2 years\u2026.", "Yes he is allowed to veto my guests as well. If he was uncomfortable with a specific guest I wanted to invite I would not invite them out of respect for my fianc\u00e9. I am not inviting past lovers because I have no reason to speak to them anymore other than friendly exchanges if I run into them.", "Lmfao. It looks like we found the fianc\u00e9. So would you be okay, that your fianc\u00e9 wants to invite a former crush to your wedding?Especially since she flirted with him, while you guys were exclusively dating? Of course not, you would have shut her request down, and the decision would\u2019ve been final. Why the hell, should she allow her ex to be disrespectful to her? Especially on their wedding day of all days, invite a former flame to reunite?", "Losing deposits is cheaper than divorce...", "Oh my god, the distribution of labour there only adds to my verdict. He probably has no idea what his casual invite does to *everything* no matter who the proposed guest is\u2014and he should!! It\u2019s his wedding too!!! I\u2019d be afraid of what this foreshadows for the marriage. Will he throw other random changes at you and expect you to roll with them? Will he take time to understand and appreciate the work you put into things that benefit him? Will he step up and *contribute* the same kind of work to benefit you?", "Also, she said she wants to catch up and he invites her to the wedding where they will have very little time to do that. Makes no sense to me, NTA OP", "BD said Incontinentia Buttocks was too much AH for him so he expected they'd split", "I brought this up and he thinks I\u2019m insane for even thinking that way.

He has and is prioritizing her over you.\n\nNTA, and seriously consider if you want to be married to someone who values an ex as more important than you.", "I would take this past disrespect.\n\nWhen they flirted when you were together, that harmed you emotionally.  Harmed your trust.\n\nInviting her without talking to you first is ignoring that past pain.\n\nOr not having care or consideration about it.\nYou were supposed to be his first.", "Mwybe he does not like one of your bridesmaids all that much?", "Not everybody is an insecure little kid. She is stupid to marry someone she does not trust.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Especially since she flirted with him, while you guys were exclusively dating?\" .. Either she flirted with him, and he did not react - then it isn't an issue. ... Or he did react, than she has a problem with her partner, not with the girl.", "You are right about him not understanding how weddings and the planning that goes into it works. He is pretty dense when it comes to that. I was working less at the time we were planning so it just made sense for me to do most of it and I really enjoyed a lot of it. He would have helped if I asked him to.", "That's him catching up, showing her he's off the market completely", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Okay, that's gonna sound crazy but I think you should do it. You should hire a PI. You don't deserve to marry someone who keeps things from you, chats in a flirtatious way and invites her to YOUR wedding without taking your feelings into consideration. Better be safe than sorry. It'll be worth the money.", "If it went the way he told you (her reaching out to him that weekend), it's because she wants his attention on your wedding day. You know what she will wear and trying to be alone with him etc.", "If she shows in a wedding dress their friendship better end", "If he did, I would expect him to tell me and we would talk it over like adults before I made any decisions about inviting them.", "Please, expect your life partner to PROPOSE help, (and better, see by himself what needs to be done and do it), not just to wait around for you to ask him.\n\nAlso, please take into consideration that one doesn't need to become physical to cheat on a spouse. Why does he want her there ? To catch up on life ? Sorry but this is his wedding, I expect him to be quite buzy, a bit with with everyone and mostly with you."]}
