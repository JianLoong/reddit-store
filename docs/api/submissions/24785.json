We are getting married in 3 weeks and I already have the guest list finalized and I have already started telling vendors the headcounts. \n\nYesterday my fianc\u00e9 comes to me to ask if we can add another 4 people to our guest list, one of which being his former crush from high school/college that he pined after. She never wanted anything to do with him in that way. I know they have hooked up in the past and I honestly don\u2019t care whatever he did before meeting me. The issue is, that while we were dating exclusively they were very flirty on Snapchat a few years ago and I found out about it. He put a stop to it and hasn\u2019t spoken to her much in the last few years. \n\nDuring his bachelor trip last weekend, this girl reaches out to my fianc\u00e9 and is wanting to catch up on the past few years. He tells her that she is invited to the wedding along with her best friend from high school and their plus ones. Am I the asshole for not wanting her there? \n\nHe is making me feel like I am being childish by not wanting her there on or wedding day because they haven\u2019t been physical while we were dating, but I just don\u2019t feel like I can fully relax and enjoy the wedding with her presence in the room. It might be a self esteem issue with me, but I feel so self conscious knowing the girl he pined after a long time ago is there when I really want his attention directed towards me on our wedding day. I\u2019m not inviting any past lovers out of respect to my fianc\u00e9 and I wish he would do the same. \n\nPlease tell me if I am being childish and immature about this situation. I know in my heart he would never physically cheat on me. I\u2019ve worked really hard to get past his behavior from a few years ago when he was flirting with her on Snapchat and I thought we were in a really great place until he mentioned this.

It sounds like he is making an effort to look good in front of her at your expense. Her good opinion of him is more valuable to him then yours.

It just seems like very strange timing\u2026.", "My stomach just sank reading this. I feel like if at some point I can\u2019t find him during the wedding I will immediately think of the worse possible scenario and cause a scene whether that is happening or not.", "Nope. I\u2019m inviting 20 people and most are family and a few close girlfriends. He is inviting 120 people and I was okay with all of them except her.", "I told him this and his defensiveness afterwards is what is very odd to me.", "Exactly my point. I would not care if she was invited if it was a past relationship. I was exclusively dating him and living with him at the time their Snapchat conversations were happening. He claims there was nothing sexual/flirty going on. If that was the case, why can\u2019t you text about it? The reason I told him to cut contact with her was because I looked over his shoulder one day and she wrote \u201cyou can\u2019t do that anymore. You aren\u2019t single\u201d so I really have no bad feelings towards her. It\u2019s him that disrespected me.", "The timing is very odd to me. I know a lot of the guys on the bachelor trip went to high school with her too. I think it may have been a \u201cRemember so and so from high school that you had a big crush on? What\u2019s she up to now? Let\u2019s find out by contacting her!\u201d", "This!!!! I\u2019m like whoa whoa whoa\u2026. are we not going to acknowledge homegirl waited until he was on his bachelor trip to reach out?? It\u2019s also very concerning that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 has such little regard for her feelings and then has the audacity to not understand why she\u2019s hurt by HIS disrespect!! OP, I think you need to have a very blunt conversation with your fianc\u00e9 before you get married. Marriage is about both people and if he\u2019s willing to die on this hill, marriage is going to be rough. If this were me, he would be an ex fianc\u00e9.", "Was he drinking when he invited her? Was it just a drunk invite and now he feels like he needs to commit to his word or something?", "Do not marry this male . You will end with heart ache HUNNI don't do it", "Because he probably never stopped talking to her and they are trying to make it seem like they\u2019re just catching up so she gets an invite to the wedding.\n\nHe was still trying to flirt with her after FOUR years with you OP.\n\nShe\u2019s \u201cthe one that got away\u201d for him.", "So then dont marry him. Don't do that yourself", "OP, i'd bet money she recently became single, that's why she reached out. You're right not to blame her since its not her doing any cheating. But your fianc\u00e9 is only too happy to enter an emotional affair with this woman. He is ready to disrespect you again.", "It was most likely a drunk invite.", "She shouldn't I wouldn't.  He will cheat on her just a matter of time .", "Are you trying out for the Olympics here? Mental gymnastics much or can you just not read when she said he didn't have anyone he objected to?", "*He is pretty dense when it comes to that.*\n\nSounds like he's pretty dense about how you feel about this ex-crush as well.", "sounds like it could be weaponized incompetence... whenever I hear \"he would help if I asked\" on this sub usually the guy is looking for his wife to also be his mother", "NTA but tell him to do the work NOW.", "it's him showing her that he is willing to find a place for her in his life no matter how \"taken\" he is.", "She actually recently got engaged and invited him to her engagement party in October\u2026", "Exactly. He is claiming they were best friends and only stopped being best friends when I said I was uncomfortable with them Snapchatting all the time. If it was through text I would maybe feel a little different but because I had no idea what they were saying to each other I was very uncomfortable. The fact that he stopped talking to her when I said I was uncomfortable makes me think it probably wasn\u2019t so innocent.", "If she shows in a wedding dress I\u2019m catching a charge that day \ud83d\ude05", "Hmm, then it should be ok to resend a drunken invite. I feel like everyone should know that drunken plans aren't official plans. I'm confused why he's sticking by it so adamantly now. You're right, your wedding isn't the place for this reunion. Maybe a coffee some time after the wedding, but this is totally weird. Especially because they haven't been in each other's lives lately. This shouldn't be that big of a deal.\n\nOh, and NTA. I really hope you two can figure it out! I'm not sure if you feel like you can show him this thread or not, but maybe that would convince him that you're not being insecure or unreasonable and that many, many others agree with you.", "Not to be cold but that's kind of how it's coming off to me.  \n\nAnd part of my brain is telling me. If not you're freaking wedding day then when should you be put first?\n\nI'll say do not let them tell you you're being a bridezilla because I think you're being perfectly reasonable in why you feel the way you do.  \n\nHe at the very very LEAST asked you before inviting her.  \n\nMy spouse and I check with each other before invites and confirming on RSVP.\nNot for permission, but to make sure the others okay with it.  Because we are a team.", "He might find that he objects to someone NOW.", "Yeah, he's looking to begin an emotional affair with this woman. Which he already did once. \n\nI'd be willing to bet she reached out because she recently became single, and is looking for attention. Your fiance is only too happy to give it (and anything else she wants) to her. \n\nHe has told you that you are second to her, and always will be. This will not go away OP.", "They weren\u2019t best friends.\n\nShe \u201cfriendzoned\u201d him and he just held on for hope she would change her mind .", "So you mean he may be a petty asshole doing some kind of tit for tat? Charming if that happens"]}
