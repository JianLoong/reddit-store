Honestly, it sounds like MIL bit off more than she can chew, which is not your problem.", "You're NTA. She was taking advantage of you and your inability to refuse her requests. There are so many options these days for transportation. She's going to have to learn to call an Uber.", "NTA.  MIL choosing not to drive is not your problem.  None of these things are emergencies.  She needs to figure out some other plan for when she needs transport. This isn't your problem and her requests are unreasonable.", "NTA - this is a husband problem because it is his mother.  You and your husband need to have a discussion about his mother.  You were happy to help as a one off even though it was a major inconvenience, but now she thinks it should be your job to chauffeur her around when she needs it.  That is not your job and you should not have volunteered for it one time in the first place\u2026 \n\nYour husband needs to have the conversation with her that she shouldn\u2019t be mad because you are busy.  He should ask her what her plan was when she signed up for babysitting even though she doesn\u2019t drive??  If she is going g to babysit SILs kids while SIL is out of town, then SIL needs to bring her over to the house before she leaves, and MIL needs to stay at SILs until SIL returns.  You are not in the position to be a chauffeur on demand for MIL, and neither is hubby, and it is rude of MIL to expect that.  SIL should have asked how she was going to do this, and when she said oh, OP can take me back and forth, SIL should have let you and hubby know\u2026\n\nYou are the wife of her son.  Your relationship with her is through your husband.  If your husband were to disappear tomorrow, you would not have a relationship with her.  So I would suggest that you need to stop communicating directly with MIL, because there is no upside for you to try to maintain a separate relationship with her.  If she needs you for something, she should be asking hubby or asking you both as a couple if you can do task she wants done.  You are not her bonus daughter, she is not your bonus mom.  If she is addressing the couple or her son, then she can\u2019t be directly angry with you.  You are after all, his wife, not her daughter.  I would suggest you subtly change the communication dynamic to stop responding to her immediately, and when you do talk or text with her, loop hubby in or say you need to discuss with hubby.  That way you are deferring to hubby or you and he as a couple rather than you being her point of contact.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Thank you for the awesome advice.\n\nMy husband knew before I did that his mother was going to ask me for a drive. He knows how I feel about it as I've voiced how frustrated I'm getting that she won't take the hint. Problem is instead of telling her no, he just tells her to ask me. For some reason he thinks it's an issue between his mom and I and has nothing to do with him. I'm going to have to have a chat with him.\n\nAlso I know I should not have ever done it the first time.

Usually the grandson goes to MILs house.\n\nI am also surprised that I keep putting myself in these positions. And these two situations I've discussed on this account are nothing compared to the hell I went through with my BIL who is a mean, violent alcoholic. I lived with his bull for 2 years cause the family kept convincing my husband not to kick him out. Until he beat up my husband, then they agreed he should move out.\n\nUnfortunately my husband's eyes are not open to how dysfunctional his family is and how poorly they not only treat me but him as well. My own family is very toxic and used to lie to me, steal from me, take advantage of me before I moved far away from them.
