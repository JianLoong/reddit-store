I agree that home structure is an influence, but if you were a father I kinda feel there would be less pushback from the Reddit community. \n\nYou were not really her mom, you paid so that she is cared for, but you made your choice of not being in her life. So many men do it every day and while it's frowned upon, generally if they pay child support they are so often off the hook. \n\nShe is an adult now. It's not like her father died when she was a teen. She is an adult that should be able to care for herself. As she is not, you offered to support her financially, which at this point in her life is anyway more than many \"real\" (aka in her life) parents would do. \n\nThe choice of not telling your kids... Well I cannot really judge that, it's a tough one. I can see why you do not want to do that, but I also don't think it's healthy to hide these things from your family.

I think for the sake of your daughter you could try and have a relationship with her.

I would suggest mentioning again that you can help her with staying at a hotel. Maybe also a therapist if she is facing problems that she would like to discuss? \n\nI do feel bad for her but you paid child support for as long as it is legally required. You dont have an obligation for anything else. Also, you mentioned that she might be a bad influence for your teenagers. If you feel that in any way she could harm your kids, then the hotel is an even better option.", "Def NTA.  The fact that she's been jailed is enough for me.  You paid child support, which is all most of reddit seems to think is required of men.  She's an adult -- why she was so dependent on her father is beyond me.  \n\nAlso, you're not letting her go homeless -- you offered her a hotel. Why would she be so hell bent on being in your home? She can't be expecting any sort of emotional support, given your relationship and your offer of a hotel.  Maybe she's trying to establish tenancy so you'd have to jump through hoops to evict her?", "NTA. \n\nI was struck that your adult daughter continues to say its \"not too late\" for you to have her in your home, despite clearly being angry with you.  This doesn't sound like it'd be a positive or constructive time for anyone in the family, and you are justified in saying no to any adult family member staying in your house if you have concerns.\n\nMany here are looking to judge you for what you did in the past. You didn't ask for judgement on that aspect. So I haven't I included it in my judgement. However, one common theme of both the past and the present is that you do appear rather cowardly - first by walking away on a kid when the going got tough, but second for chickening out of telling your other children they have a half sibling somewhere (even if you dont intend for them to have contact). \n\nIf your adult daughter is a difficult/troubled character, it would be wise to let your children know she exists at some point - she may reach out to them despite you. Don't give more of your kids grounds to be angry with you.", "NTA. Another example of Reddit users being toxic to an op. She\u2019s allowed to make the choice of not being in her kids life. She\u2019s also allowed to decide that she wants children later. She has no reason to tell her other children unless SHE wants to. She was very kind in her offer to pay for a hotel. The daughter is 25 years old. They don\u2019t know each other at all. I wouldn\u2019t want a virtual stranger to stay in my home with my kids either. She\u2019s at least 6-12 years older than ops children and has a criminal record. She very well could be a bad influence or even harm the kids.", "YTA. Like it or not, you\u2019re her mother and you are abandoning her when she needs you most. Ultimately it\u2019s up to you, but I hope you can live with yourself for the choices you\u2019re making. What\u2019s done in the dark always comes to light, your daughters will find out about their older sister, and I hope you\u2019re prepared for when that day comes.

Leaving a child is understandable when a parent has issues and realises it's not safe to be taking care of a child, but not helping the child you've brought into the world because it's not something you're willing to tell your family is just so plain wrong.", "I definitely understand that reasoning. But, in her response, OP stated she kept no/ low contact since she only wanted to make sure her daughter was raised in a good environment. If there were extenuating circumstances, OP should have made them clearer.", "Agreed keeping secrets is useless and can be harmful\nMy grandma was also neglectful tbf and kept so many secrets with my dad which automatically led him being so insecure about family", "You are comparing the issues from 1960s a time where racism was at its peak to current period", "25 years old and still is dependent on her father if she got a job and chipped in she wouldnt be in this condition", "Sometimes she actually has to think for he goddamn child why did she give birth if she didn\u2019t want the child could have easily given the child for adoption but ruined her life literally 100 reasons why both parents are AH", "Yeah most prolly OP screwed up here by not telling earlier now she does have the balls tell them that their half sibling sleeps with multiple people and went behind bars", "The child is the product of a violation so she allows her daughter to be raised by the violator? Wow! The story definitely has layers. At the end of the day, the child was an innocent product of her parents and doesn\u2019t deserve the rejection. The only good thing to come from the situation is the girl is alive to love her own truth.", "There could be health issues that OP is either unaware of or not disclosing.", "Nah weed is huge issue idk about where you live but in my country its illegal and people see weed smokers as scums so if the op lived somewhere where weed smokers are looked as scums she is correct tbf and the daughter is 25 and still has no job would\u2019nt see her as a good influence either tbf", "I agree with that. I'm a bite the bullet, loud, outspoken person and I would have let my other kids know from day 1. Like, hey you have another sibling, I couldn't take care of her when she was younger, then switch it over to we've reconnected blah blah. It is odd to me that she seems like the type to throw money at a problem and call it solved. She owes it to all her kids, and herself, to come to terms with this and have a happy family all around.", "That\u2019s so sad. Hope you\u2019re all doing ok.", "In most cases placing a child for adoption requires consent of both parents.", "I don\u2019t think you get my point. Her daughter was a preteen when she had her other kids. How long did she wait to decide if she was going to introduce the kids? \n\nWas her daughter in jail as a teen?\n\nShe likely made a decision not to introduce them before her daughter was ever in jail.", "The op Says she was dependent on him meaning he was the breadwinner but I can see both parents being neglecting their kid here", "Weed was made illegal in America to screw over the hemp industry and to people of color in jail. Coffee does more damage to teenagers then weed.", "I am doing op but my dad is insecure to this day and my grandma is old and lost contact with most relatives but my grandma still an AH for neglecting my aunt and dad and prioritizing her siblings over her kids", "If it does then we can say the father disagreed with the idea of adoption and wanted to raise the kid bur screwed her up if thats the case then the father is more to blame", "That\u2019s a really sad situation and something that happens too often \ud83d\ude22"]}
