We are also planning to go at 8pm and stay until 2 in the morning. \n\nWhen I was there she changed the subject and it seemed like her kid forgot about it. However, the night of they showed up with her kid. She was jumping up and down excited. I asked if she was sure about this and if she understood what this event was. Even the ticketing and security asked them if they were sure. Well, sure enough 10 minutes past the gate she was screaming and crying. The scare actors didn't even go near her, just looking at them scared her. They kept her there for another 2 hours. We only did 1 of the 10 houses with them. Her dad had to hold her the entire time and we had to keep stopping because she was too scared to keep going. I pulled my friend to the side and told her they needed to take her home and that they need to learn to say no to her and not spoil her or give into her all the time and that now she's probably traumatized and isn't going to sleep because they were reckless enough to bring her to something like this. \n\nShe got extremely upset at me and said I would never understand because I don't have kids. Even though I work in a day care and work with kids her age every day, 5 days a week. She said I was being insensitive and that her kid should be allowed to enjoy the night to, even when I told her her kid obviously wasn't. My boyfriend and I ended up leaving them and going off to do our own thing. She told our mutual friends a different version of the story to make me sound bad and now I have everyone calling me an asshole and bitch. \n\nMy other friend thinks I might have overstepped and crossed a line but my boyfriend thinks my opinion was valid and it concerned the emotional health of a child. So should I have just kept it to myself or used better wording? \n\nPS: getting a babysitter wasn't even an issue. My friend's mom is always helping out and the original plan was her mom was gonna keep the kid for the night anyways. I had even talked to her mom about it when I bumped into her at the grocery store the day before the event and she was excited to have her granddaughter over.
