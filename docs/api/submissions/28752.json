She has been spoiled since she popped out the womb.

My boyfriend works for universal and gets in for free, a comped ticket (used for me), and discounts on food and merch. She and her husband have been wanting to go to and decided to join us last minute. We were talking about it at her place when her daughter overheard. Suddenly, she was whining and complaining wanting to go. This event is definitely not one you should bring your kids to. It's full of jump scares, gore, and drunk adults. We are also planning to go at 8pm and stay until 2 in the morning. \n\nWhen I was there she changed the subject and it seemed like her kid forgot about it. However, the night of they showed up with her kid. She was jumping up and down excited. I asked if she was sure about this and if she understood what this event was. Even the ticketing and security asked them if they were sure. Well, sure enough 10 minutes past the gate she was screaming and crying. The scare actors didn't even go near her, just looking at them scared her. They kept her there for another 2 hours. We only did 1 of the 10 houses with them. Her dad had to hold her the entire time and we had to keep stopping because she was too scared to keep going. I pulled my friend to the side and told her they needed to take her home and that they need to learn to say no to her and not spoil her or give into her all the time and that now she's probably traumatized and isn't going to sleep because they were reckless enough to bring her to something like this. \n\nShe got extremely upset at me and said I would never understand because I don't have kids. Even though I work in a day care and work with kids her age every day, 5 days a week. She said I was being insensitive and that her kid should be allowed to enjoy the night to, even when I told her her kid obviously wasn't. My boyfriend and I ended up leaving them and going off to do our own thing. She told our mutual friends a different version of the story to make me sound bad and now I have everyone calling me an asshole and bitch. \n\nMy other friend thinks I might have overstepped and crossed a line but my boyfriend thinks my opinion was valid and it concerned the emotional health of a child. So should I have just kept it to myself or used better wording? \n\nPS: getting a babysitter wasn't even an issue. My friend's mom is always helping out and the original plan was her mom was gonna keep the kid for the night anyways. I had even talked to her mom about it when I bumped into her at the grocery store the day before the event and she was excited to have her granddaughter over.

It's not that what you said was wrong--just say the really critical thing and keep the rest for later, I guess.\n\nSince you work with children, and I'm a teacher, we both know that these parents are in a world of future hurt if they don't start saying no. If you repair the friendship, and she's open to it, you can be there to reinforce what the little girl's future teachers are bound to say. Because they will say it.", "Nta. Good job looking out for the kid. Thank you for speaking up for the little girl.

These parents do real damage to their kids and the community.", "This reminds me to people who takes their really young kids to see movies like Deadpool because he looks a little like Spider-Man and they think he is funny in the commercials. Traumatizing a kid and making the experience worse for everyone else for not being able to say no is awful parenting and she needed a reality check. Specially if she uses phrases like \"you'll never understand because you don't have kids\". You don't have a cow but chances are you know not to take a vow upstairs (now matter how convincing the cow might be). \n\nEven if your timing wasn't optimal, she deserves to hear that, and every person in common who she lied to should know the truth.

But in our society you aren't allowed to call people out on bad parenting or being an asshole around anything to do with their kids. Sadly, those are the rules, whatever. The only thing you can do/say is that it was innapropriate for her to have brought her daughter along to an adult event, ruining everyone's time. I have friends with kids and they would never pull this crap. It's not a kid problem, it's a \"friend\" problem. Also, she threw shade on you on top of it all. Look, here's a tip: It doesn't seem like you have kids. Trust me when I say, find new friend's without kids or people with kids who get that your idea of an outing doesn't include earplugs and chucky cheese.", "NTA\n\nNot everything is geared for children, and people need to learn that not everyone wants to have to accommodate someone else's child at an event meant for older teens and adults.

The problem is that it wasn't your place to say it. \n\nYour daycare job does not make you an expert on children, does not make your opinions more valid, and does not mean another parent should supplant your judgment for their own.", "YTA and hear me out \ni think people are confusing being right with being an AH. while i\u2019m 1000% on your side and believe you\u2019re in the right, what you said about makes you the AH here. you could\u2019ve stopped at \u201cshe\u2019s scared take her home\u201d or you could\u2019ve just told here you and your bf were going off on your own. while you\u2019re right, there was absolutely a better way to present that", "[removed]", "NTA.

I didn't make the rules, I don't agree with with it but it is what is.

Since you are doing a family thing instead, we will go and do our own thing so you can tailor your activities to her.

It ruined it for the family (who often had to leave without a refund) and ruined it for the rest of the tour group. \n\nThe worst part was the way these parents treated their kids. Shouting at them like \u2018stop it, you\u2019re ruining our holiday!\u2019 and telling little boys to stop crying because \u2018boys don\u2019t cry\u2019. Pissed me off so much how they treat their kids. Traumatising them and then blaming them.\n\nThe worst ones were the ones who shouted at us scare actors for scaring the kids! Like what did you expect? Telling us to stop doing our job, and we were just doing the general scares and tried to avoid the kids but the entire place is scary, that\u2019s the whole point. I remember a woman with a baby in a pram having a go at us for being too loud\u2026Entitled parents are the worst.", "Maybe the parents thought it'd be like one of those cute tiktoks of the toddlers who dgaf about the spooks and try to hug everyone in costume", "Or an adult", "I have no idea.

They also warn you when booking tickets that it can be intense for young children and my friend and her husband have been before. When you go you rarely see any kids under 13 there too at most 1 but normally they are exiting the park at that time. So I don't really understand the idea of bringing her kid. That's just my thought process and I do understand I might have gone off on her a little too much but I was mostly angry at the situation she put her kid in."]}
