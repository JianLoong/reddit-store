The house I am currently living in I bought a few months ago. I barely have any furniture in it and don't plan on buying anymore for a while because I plan on renovating and don't want it in the way. The only things to sleep on is my bed and a couch.\n\n I told my sister that. She said it was okay and that she would bring an air mattress for her sons to sleep on and she would sleep on the couch. I also told her that the couch was really small (loveseat sized) and uncomfortable. She said it would be fine for one night. I also told her to bring their own bedding because I really don't have much aside from what I use.\n\nThe night of the wedding my sister's son's are tired so they leave the reception early around 9pm. I wanted to stay longer so I told her would get a ride home from someone else and gave her the keys to my house.\n\nWhen I get home around midnight my sister is watching tv in the living room. Her son's aren't there. She explains to me that her air mattress wouldn't inflate. so she put her son's in my bed and said since my bed is big enough she could share with them and I could sleep on the couch.\n\nI said that wasn't happening. The couch is way to uncomfortable to sleep on and way too short for me. I would be hanging off the end. I already have enough trouble sleeping and I had stuff I needed to do the next day. I tried to get the air mattress the work, but it wouldn't turn on. So I got my spare blanket and set it up on the floor along with a sleeping bag. My sister reluctantly got the boys up and off my bed. Once they were all in their spots I went to bed and quickly fell asleep.\n\nThe next morning my sister was in a really bad mood. They all didn't sleep the whole night because the blankets I set up on the ground weren't thick enough and it was uncomfortable. My sister tried sleeping on the floor, but her son's fought about sleeping on the couch because there wasn't room enough for the both of them. My sister said I could have at least checked up on them or let the boys sleep in my bed with me, but to me that's really weird and I would not have been comfortable with that.

That was her arrangement.  It's not anyone's fault the air mattress didn't work, but it was an option your sister introduced, so it is her burden.

You explained what it would be like if she and the boys stayed with you and she agreed it would be fine.

You are NTA, OP.", "Esh she imposed on you and you were a bad host. When you described your layout my first thought was \"okay so the three of them take the bed and you take the couch for a night\" so it doesn't surprise me that's where it landed before you decided to have them all sleep on the floor.", "ESH\n\nAnd honestly I'm not even sure your sister is that horrible but for you, why didn't you just give them a hard no instead of being passive? But also, why couldn't you just sleep with the nephews and let your sister sleep on the couch?That way the boys weren't on the floor and your sister would have had the couch? You are their uncle or aunt, there is nothing weird about the kids sleeping with you but I guess. I just agree with her about you checking them because once you decided you let them stay, you could at least make sure they were halfway comfortable", "^^^\n\nYep. Definitely NTA at all.\nIf she wanted a bed and good night\u2019s sleep she shoulda gotten the hotel.\n\nSorry about the mess, OP.

You get what you pay for and she knew what she was getting into.", "Uh, Hello. She found out though didn't she?

It is not OP's fault. OP gave them clear warning about arrangement and it is her fault for not checking the air mattress and being prepared before coming over.", "I don't really need one though. I don't plan on letting my sister stay over again.", "Did you read the part about where OP didn't invite them to stay over but granted a favor? OP never offered to play host but acquiesced with qualifiers and boundaries sister willfully ignored. NTA.", "Somebody didn\u2019t read the post all the way huh? He didn\u2019t invite them. He\u2019s not a host nor a hotel. He told them exactly what he did and didn\u2019t have. It\u2019s the mother\u2019s (parents) job to make sacrifices and supply their children\u2019s needs not OP.

That and/or sleeping mats (2-4\" thick).  Can before nephews, can be for drinking friends, could be for you drinking over at a friends.", "Yup. I'm just also used to the idea that a few times a decade you get one night of shitty sleep in order to do a favour for loved ones.", "No, I did. I'm just also used to the idea that sometimes one hosts family despite it being inconvenient.", "No you should have said no from the start because you didn't want them at your house.\n\nYou were passive in saying \"well i only have this couch and this bed\" when you should have said \"no i don't have the capacity/accommodations\" for you three to stay the night.

Doesn't sound like OP really wanted sis and fam sleeping over to begin with. They already did her a favor, not giving up the only bed does not an asshole make.

She could have gotten in her car, driven to the store, gotten a new air mattress. Problem solved. You were letting her couch surf to save money.
