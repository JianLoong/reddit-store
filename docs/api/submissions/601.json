{"id": 601, "submission_id": "yhwvp2", "title": "AITA for wanting some candy while being sick.", "selftext": "So it's a lot more than what the title seems like.\n\nSome background info:\n\nI (14F) live in New Zealand and today is Halloween, I have had back-to-back colds/viruses for the past six weeks, two are of which the school holidays when I didn't get sick. I have mild asthma and am quite prone to getting ill. I've had a total of eight days at school since early middle September and missed multiple events for school and with friends. Everything has been quite stressful as I get quite sick each time and I have missed most classes in which we are revising for exams and I am too sick to keep up with everything. I have not had covid or do have it and have taken multiple covid tests each time.\n\nSo as today is Halloween, I was supposed to go Trick to Treating with my very close friend group at my house and sort out costumes last Saturday. I got sick again last Thursday and can't do any of that so everything got cancelled and they are going to a different friend's neighbourhood. I miss out on a lot when I get sick so instead of Trick or Treating, I will be staying home and giving out candy to all the Trick or Treaters (with a mask on ofc).\n\nBecause I am missing out on all of this, my mum (53) promised I could choose two bags of lollies (like gummy bears) that I could gradually eat. When today came, I was told when I asked did get the bags, no because she doesn't want me eating crap when I'm sick. My mum got really angry (I think she was at the end of her tether) and said I'm not doing enough to get better and I need to try harder.\n\nThe problem with this is that I HAVE had taken care of myself, although in situations like these I try not to say much to get her madder. I never play games or push myself, but rather, I lay in bed/couch all day, take special gargles for sore throats, take multiple medications and vitamins, plenty of fluids, and eat healthily (apart from some iceblocks when I don't/can't eat), and take care of my dog and do some chores. I do a lot to get better as well as try to do chores when asked. I have been prescribed and taken a lot of different medications for everything I've had. I wouldn't even have even eaten all of this in one go because that would make me nauseous, I would spread them out over time (a week or so) and probably eat most of it when I get better eventually.\n\nI just wanted one thing to make up for everything I've had to miss without feeling guilty. Even that was denied even though it was promised and now I feel confused about whether or not my wanting something like that was too much to ask for. Or if I'm doing enough to get myself better/trying hard enough. In my area, you can typically get 3-5 bags worth in my area of lollies in 2-3 hours. My sister (13) said she would not share any of her lollies with me when she gets back which is why I want my own from the supermarket.\n\nEdit: Ages.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667179455, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhwvp2/aita_for_wanting_some_candy_while_being_sick/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What difference does it make if you eat candy while you\u2019re sick anyway?", "No, you're definitely NTA. Being sick frequently is a crappy experience, and being sick over Halloween when you're of an age to go trick or treating absolutely sucks. You deserve a treat!\n\nYour mom is an AH for telling you you're not doing enough to try to get better, though. As if you actually have any control over how your immune system functions. But if you want to play along with her, tell her that resting will help you get better faster than doing chores will.", "NTA- It's not your fault that you keep getting sick and it sounds like you are doing what you can to get better, even still helping out when you can. Your still missing out on a lot of stuff and getting you a bag of candy won't hurt you. She can even put it up until you get better. I don't let my kids have junk when sick but having something to look forward to isn't a crime.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Just ignore what she said. Even the fact that she was mad in the first place makes her an AH, because first she said you could have some lollies, then she got mad when you asked about them and she changed her mind. That's not cool."]}
