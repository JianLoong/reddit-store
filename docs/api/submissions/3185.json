He'd only reply with \"I'll take that as a maybe for now.\" Which was honestly frustrating. \n\nLately he started calming down and I thought he realized how overbearing he's been, so we kept being friends and all, casual talk. He started giving me rings and necklaces and other gifts and i thought he was just trying to make up for being a creep. \n\nWell, fast forward to yesterday. He texted me again if I'm willing to give dating a shot, and that he thinks we have a real bond worth trying - I replied again with no, and that I thought by now he learned that it's not gonna happen. He got upset and said I had no problem \"letting it happen\" when i was getting gifts and how shallow I was. \n\nI told him I thought the jewelry was a gift as a friend, not bribery to start dating. and he said he wouldn't bribe me, but he wants them back because clearly I don't appreciate them. I refused saying that if he wouldn't bribe me, they're still a gift and he's got no right to demand them back. \n\nI'd honestly have no problem returning them (haven't worn them once after the first time, not my style) if he didn't expect me to date him when he gave them in the first place. \n\nShould I return the jewelry? AITA?\n\nAdditional info \u2014 When he gave me each piece, I repeatedly told him I don't want it and he insisted I'd take it, so I'm more held back on giving it back because it just feels.. wrong? I don't know how to describe it - he insisted I take it and now that I refuse to date him, it's like I'm the one who insisted that he gives it to me? Maybe I'm overreacting\n\n- I see a lot of people going \"Oh but you knew what his intentions were and didn't stop him\" and - I really didn't, I failed to mention this but I'm on the spectrum, I genuinely have trouble reading people's intentions and motives, I'm not doing it to be all \"shy and quirky\" or \"lead him on\" \u2014 this isn't to excuse anything, just to clarify I've had and have trouble with reading emotions", "created_utc": 1669335967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3z0q6/aita_for_refusing_to_return_jewelry/", "score": 85, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Give everything he ever gave you back with a clear and blunt \"the answer always was, and always will be, no.\" Keep in mind that this is purely for your comfort so that you don't have to keep dealing with his harassment and this is now into harassment territory, even if only light harassment. Return the items in a public place, like a cafe, and have at least one witness to the exchange. Have video taken of the return so that he can't come back saying something about you keeping any of the gifts. If he refuses to take anything back, let him know that's his problem get up and leave while leaving all the gifts behind. It might not hurt to let one of the workers at wherever you make the exchange know what is happening so that they can also bear witness and take video as an independent 3rd party. This guy sounds like he wouldn't be beyond leaving everything on the table and letting it get taken or thrown away, simply to say you kept it and won't return it to the rest of your friend group or perhaps even law enforcement. The very last thing you want is to be dragged through the courts over this, simply because you're not going to want the hassle. Having that independent 3rd party with video evidence would go a long way towards making him back off in this situation. Go the lowest contact possible afterwards. If your friends plan something and he's there, either keep as many people between you and he as possible or plainly tell ALL your friends that you will not open yourself up to continued harassment by him and you have to leave so he doesn't get any further ideas.", "My friends (who are still friends with him) have actually told me after this incident he's done it to them aswell, giving them free stuff from his work and refusing to take \"no\" for dating and taking it as a \"maybe\"\n\nHe only stopped once he heard they'd gotten a boyfriend", ">It only encourages them.\n\nThere's nothing OP could do to discourage this guy, and she's not at fault for not realizing he was setting up this little scam.", "It's more of a me being petty thing, I told him several times while he gave it that I don't want it, and he refused to take it back - insisting I keep it, \n\nNow he suddenly wants them back now that I refused his offer again - even when I didn't want them in the first place", "I'm on the spectrum, it's often hard for me to understand people's emotions and motives, I genuinely thought he was trying to make up for his past actions, \n\nAnd I didn't \"thank him for the lovely gifts\", I insisted multiple times that he takes them back and he kept refusing and even outright ignoring me - even the thanks I did offer was more awkward than thankful", "I honestly never even touch them, it's more of a petty thing because (as mentioned in edit) he's the one who kept insisting I'd accept them when I repeatedly said no, and I honestly would have no problem at all returning them if he wasn't using it as a means to an end", "Or maybe these men you're talking about could not try and buy a date and communicate properly instead, or learn to take no for an answer.", "When someone hits on you to the point of making you uncomfortable and then spends weeks not taking no for an answer, it doesn\u2019t take much emotional awareness to understand that they\u2019re likely to try to find another way to weasel their way into your pants.", "Emotional awareness is quite low, actually \ud83d\ude2d\n\nForgot to mention I'm on the spectrum, it's hard for me to understand people's emotions and motives - I genuinely thought he was trying to make up for what he did.", "When someone\u2019s on the hunt, the prey is not an asshole for taking the bait.", "NTA\n\nA gift is a gift (morally and legally)\n\nI would consider selling the jewellery and donating the money to charity.

This was a socal rule I learned very young, not everyone does. But if someone expressed sexual interest in you, they can never be your friend. The likelihood is very high that their main motivation for being your friend is that it might end up as more. \n\nThis man has behaved very inappropriately towards you and still is. It would be very inappropriate of you to continue to be his friend now that you know this. Return the jewellery (kinda struggling to understand why you would want it tbh) ASAP, and cut him out of your life. \n\nI also want to recommend looking around and see what's available in your area in terms of coaching/relationship coaching because there's a few things in your post that make me feel like maybe there's some other social rules around dating that nobody has taught you or that you haven't picked up on and that makes me worried for your safety. People are quick to say you led them on, and to a neurotypical that's exactly what it looks like your doing. Men who feel like they've been led on (even if it was unintentional) can be very, very dangerous.", "StAlker Alert!", "NTA. The jewellery was given as a gift. He meant for it to be a bribe. It's his own fault for not understanding the word no.\n\nKeep the jewellery as compensation for you and a learning outcome for him.", "I don't think he has a plan for what to do with it.

Asking for it to be returned is a reminder that (in his mind) she owes him a date, or at least a refund.", "So well said", "You\u2019re playing right into his hand though. There\u2019s no reasoning with men who feel entitled to possess you as if you\u2019re an object existing solely for men\u2019s interests.

Cut him off entirely, not for a sense of petty satisfaction, but for your own safety, seriously. You owe it to yourself."]}
