{"id": 26230, "submission_id": "16a8tmb", "title": "AITA for not offering to pay for my friends food?", "selftext": "So for some context, my (18F) boyfriend works at a fairly popular steakhouse.  He\u2019s been working there for awhile and him and I go there often to eat because he gets a good staff discount.  I also sometimes go on my own to sit at the bar and get food while he\u2019s working.  Since I go pretty often, I almost always get my food/drinks staffed.  I always chat with whoever is bartending/serving and I also tip pretty well (based on the percentage of what the original bill would be), which is why I think they don\u2019t mind staffing my food lol\n\nSo the situation in question happened yesterday.  In the morning, a new coworker/friend I\u2019ve gotten pretty close with just recently (19F) asked if I wanted to go eat at the steakhouse my boyfriend works at (she didn\u2019t know he worked there).  I said yes and we ended up going that night.  It was pretty busy because it\u2019s a long weekend so we ended up sitting at the bar because the wait for a table was an hour.  One of my favourite bartenders was working and ended up serving my friend and I.\n\nBoth of us got a (non-alcoholic) drink and an entree.  We had a great time hanging out and the food was great.  After we were done, the bartender asked if we were paying together or separately, to which my friend and I both promptly responded that we would get separate bills.  The bartender handed us our bills a few minutes later.  He hadn\u2019t charged us for my drink, and had staffed my entree but not my friends.  I wasn\u2019t planning on mentioning anything to my friend, but she asked how much my food was and looked at my bill before I could even respond.  She saw that mine was clearly staffed and therefore a lot cheaper than hers.  She was confused and asked if I knew the bartender, so I explained that I sorta did because my boyfriend works there.  She just kind of brushed it off and we paid, said our goodbyes to each other, and went home our separate ways.\n\nWhen I got home, I got a text from my friend.  She said that since I knew my food would be staffed, I should\u2019ve offered to pay for both of us to save some money.  I apologized and said that I should\u2019ve just put it on my bill and she could\u2019ve e-transferred me after.  She said no and that since it was getting staffed I should just be paying for it.  I told her that I\u2019ve never brought anyone with me so I don\u2019t know if they would staff it and, even with a discount, it\u2019s still an upscale place and therefore still expensive.  But she is still insisting that I should have paid and that now she\u2019s gonna tell all our coworkers that I intentionally let her pay extra when we hung out.\n\nSo AITA for not offering to pay for my friends food when I knew mine would get staffed?", "created_utc": 1693872954, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16a8tmb/aita_for_not_offering_to_pay_for_my_friends_food/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's being weird, greedy and entitled. It would have actually been rude of you to try and get her a discount or whatevs, imo, like taking advantage of their kindness.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds very rude and severely entitled, it\u2019s also strange that she wanted to know how much your food costed. It\u2019s really unmannerly and actually bizarre that she wanted you to pay for her\u2026 her logic for why you should\u2019ve done so makes no sense either.\n\nIf she goes around telling people at your job, I\u2019d try to tell them what actually happened. Any sane and mentally stable person would view her as being a total asshole.\n\nSide note: the staffing is meant for you only, not your friends, it\u2019s the place doing you a courtesy, so don\u2019t feel bad for not thinking of getting her food staffed too. It\u2019d probably be kind of rude to do so.", "NTA. It's like belated attempted extortion: Pay for me or I'll smear your reputation .\n\nPerhaps reply to her (again )\n\n\"Sure, tell everyone how you expected me to pay for your meal at the restaurant that you suggested after I unexpectedly got x% discount, then you threatened to smear my reputation. Have you considered extortion as a career choice?\"'. \n\n('I didn't even realise I got a discount until you compared bills'. They wouldn't give the discount to strangers). \n\nIf you really wanted to even it out, you might have covered her tip, but you didn't expect the discount. I'd refuse to explain it any further but perhaps get to work early and get 1st mover advantage with a trusted few at work.\n\n\"Can you believe that coworker *threatened* to bad mouth me at work if (because) I didn't pay for her at a restaurant that she suggested. This was after we each got our separate bills and i unexpectedly got x% discount because the employee recognised me as \"family\" of another employee\"\n\nPS. A gold award! That's so kind, thanks very much!!", "NTA \n\nShe didn\u2019t pay extra- she paid for exactly what she ordered", "NTA. Kind of doubt it would be free if you start bringing in guests and asking for one bill. Your friend ordered a meal with the expectation that she would pay for it; that you got a break on your bill didn't impact her except emotionally and that's her issue to deal with.", "NTA\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t pay for her food regardless of if yours is staffed. She has her own money, if she was expecting you to pay at all it\u2019s a red flag. And the fact that she\u2019s pissed that you get treated well and is acting so entitled is pretty shit. I used to visit the same bar ever single afternoon as it was below my apartment, helped them out a couple times with bartending and literally giving them basil from my windowsill for cocktails when they ran out a couple times. I barely paid for anything, but sometimes they\u2019d charge partial payment, sometimes it was on the house, it didn\u2019t matter to me, I only ordered what I could afford, so that regardless I could pay if and when I needed. Other friends would meet me there, they never expected a discount or free things, none of us were entitled to it, it was like a fun surprise sometimes. I wouldn\u2019t keep someone that entitled around, if they want to leech off of your good relationship with staff, they can go away.", "NTA She didn't \"pay extra\", she made the amount agreed upon between her and the restaurant. The contract is the menu. She's so out of pocket, she's leggings.\n\nUgh.\n\nPlus, the bartender/restaurant \"staffing\" your meal is entirely a courtesy that you are not entitled to (not that you seem \"entitled\", you seem perfectly willing to pay full price, I don't want to insult you), unless it is part of a friends and family thing. In that case, your bf is the one \"sponsoring\" your staffed meal, and your friend is not entitled to this courtesy. \n\nI get so heated about this stuff. Sorry. Heh. My dad owned a restaurant for a little while and I spent years in food service, so I have OPINIONS. :)\n\nYou did fine. \"Friend\" is no friend, and if I were you, I'd let your circle know she likes to badmouth people for no g-d reason.", "Nta, this person toxic af. No, the place does you a favor and you appreciate it, you don't know if/when they will do it, to bring someone with the assumption of a discount is crazy, this isn't a friend", "NTA. While I understand getting a discount for a friend, it\u2019s weird af to expect someone else to pay\u2026 especially when you\u2019re the one who invited them. She sounds entitled & probably not someone I\u2019d want to hang out with. She chose the place. If it was too expensive, she should have chosen a different one? I mean\u2026 she initiated everything?!", "NTA. It would be polite to do so but in no way is she obliged to that discount. She isn\u2019t the one dating your boyfriend either, so it is valid that you\u2019re the only one that gets staffed", "NTA. She\u2019s trying to mooch off you. That\u2019s not your problem.", ">she\u2019s gonna tell all our coworkers that I intentionally let her pay extra when we hung out.\n\nLet her? I don't know about your coworkers but you don't think any of mine would be siding with her. She invited herself and once she knew you'd get a discount she decided you should pay for all of it. That's just greedy.\n\nAlso, it really depends on the place but most I know discount for Family and Significant Others only. Not friend of friends. NTA", "NTA, your new friend is delusional.", "NTA. \nShe is nosy, she shouldn\u2019t have looked at your bill like that. \nI\u2019m sorry, but she doesn\u2019t sound like a real good friend. \nLooking at your bill and then going to \u201ctattle\u201d on you to co-workers! You don\u2019t owe her anything, including dinner just because your BF works there.", "NTA\n\nYour discount was because 1. your bf works there, and 2. you are a regular because of #1.\n\nIf she says something again, tell her that you quietly asked, and were told that since you had someone else with you, you would NOT have gotten a discount at all if it was all on one check and they only gave you the discount because your bf works there, which is why they asked if it was going to be separate checks. \n\nAs someone else said, she didn't \"pay extra\". She paid the price on the menu, plus fees and tips.\n\nI have a bad feeling she might have known you were might be getting discounts on your food there, which is why she picked that place, and then demanded to know how much you paid.", "What greedy, entitled and not too bright heifer.  You \u201cdidn\u2018t let her pay extra\u201d she paid the full price for her meal.  So what extra is she talking about? Plus why was she looking at your bill anyway?\n\nWhat exactly is she going to say? We went out to dinner and OP got a discount and I didn\u2018t and she should have told me that she was getting a discount and she should have paid for my full price meal?  GTFO with this BS.\n\nDon\u2019t entertain her nonsense and end this so called friendship.  She should be just a coworker.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
