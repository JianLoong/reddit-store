I try to visit them a few times a year for 3-4 days at a time. I am on one of these visits as we speak.\n\nMy friends regularly stay up until 2-3am even on days they have to get up at 6am for work. They brag about this and treat it like it\u2019s hilarious and quirky. I go to bed between 8-9pm and wake up around 5:30-6am. When I come visit them, I am almost always exhausted by 11:30-midnight while they are trying to start movies and watch mindless YouTube videos until 2am. They usually get up when we have activities planned for a certain day, but we have been late before because their bed \u201cwas just too comfortable.\u201d \n\nToday is the day I leave for home. I told my friends I wanted to be leaving here before noon so I could drive the 5+ hours home and still have time to unpack, reset, and relax. I\u2019ve been up since 9am and it\u2019s now 11am. I am packed and ready to leave. I have not heard a peep from my friends. Despite telling them multiple times I wanted to be out of here before noon, they are still in bed asleep at 11am. They told me last night that they bought ingredients for pancakes and wanted to make me breakfast before I left. I don\u2019t even think they set an alarm for today. \n\nI have considered saying something to them over the years but they are nice enough to house and feed me when I come over so I don\u2019t want to make them think I\u2019m ungrateful or being rude. I am also autistic and prefer to stick to a schedule, especially when it comes to traveling home. I don\u2019t think my friends really understand my autism and how it affects things like this. \n\nI just find it inconsiderate that they consistently stay up late knowing they will sleep in and it throws a wrench into the plan I told them I had. They are very proud of being \u201claidback\u201d and \u201cgo with the flow\u201d people, and criticize others for being too \u201cuptight\u201d about plans and schedules. \n\nI am very agitated and upset by this behavior, but I\u2019ve been told I should give them grace and try to savor my time with them because they live so far away. \n\nAITAA?

They have different ways of doing things. Is there anything else you can do while they\u2019re sleeping? If this difference bothers you, you might consider visiting them less.\n\nI don\u2019t think leaving would be rude. You told them you wanted to get home by 5:00. But I think you should leave a nice note telling them you had a great time, but you had to be on your way.", "NAH People just have different sleep schedules. I'm like you I get up early and when I visit friends I'm always up before them. In the situation you're in now, I just text them and let them know I'm leaving and they need to lock up behind me. There's nothing wrong with them sleeping in but you don't have to adhere to their schedule.", "NTA\n\nLeave them a note and just go home.", "NTA for them not being up the day you\u2019re leaving. That\u2019s annoying and not being a good host. \n\nBut you need to rethink your overall attitude toward their sleep schedule - they are night owls. You\u2019re not. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. I\u2019m like you and HATE waiting around for everyone else to get up, but it is what it is. If I want to hang out with them, I wait. And they\u2019re worth the wait.", "Leave a note saying you needed to leave and that you\u2019ll call them later. When they complain that you left without saying goodbye, explain what you just told us here. Maybe this will \u201cwake them up\u201d to their actions.", "Who plans these visits? Do they actually want you there? Do they ever visit you? Maybe they don\u2019t consider you as good as a friend as you think you are. \n\nI do think saying they\u2019ll do something and then sleeping in is shitty, since they have you expectations. But I would talk to them, how have you gone years feeling this and not said anything to friends.", "NTA\n\nI agree, they are being inconsiderate, especially with the plans set to make breakfast and see you off by noon. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s much for you to do about this. This seems very much the way they are, and they seem to resist scheduling and certainly don\u2019t have the common sense to wake up earlier when they have guests on their own. \n\nI think you should expect them to be this way and plan your visits and schedule accordingly.", "It's their house, their routine, their life. Is it annoying/inconsiderate that plans routinely fall by the wayside due to their sleeping habits? Yes! Do you have traits they might find annoying? Probably. To maintain a friendship, sometimes you have to take the good with the not so great and find a way to navigate the relationship in a way that you find manageable.\n\nIf sticking to a certain bedtime is important to you, then stick with it, regardless of how late they stay up. That's not rude. You can explain that it's what your body is used to and going to bed late leaves you feeling shitty the next day.\n\nIf you have to be on your way by a certain hour, stick to that. Leave them a note thanking them. They know you have a 5+ hour drive ahead of you.\n\nThey might not understand much about ASD and might never be able to relate to you in that way but you have every right to look after your own well-being by sticking to your plans and routines where necessary and where doing otherwise will cause you distress. We're all different and this is just one of those things.", "Autism or not we all have our own routines and a desire to stick to them.  They sleep late you get up early. They stay up late you go to bed early.  Just as much as you would like them to conform to your routine it just doesn\u2019t work that way.  I recently visited someone and we stayed up long past my normal time but of course I still got up early. They were much slower movers in the morning so our first plan of the day fell through. I adjusted they adjusted and the rest of the day was great.  That said- I wholly disagree with them not getting up to see you off.  That\u2019s just not being good hosts.  I absolutely agree with the \u201cleave a nice note and get home when it is right for you\u201d. By leaving a nicely written note you can express your gratitude for letting you stay and having had a great time seeing them and explain that you had hoped to see them at breakfast but that since they were sleeping in and you needed to get going you figured you\u2019d let them rest.  I\u2019d bet that the next visit they will get up early enough to spend time with you before you leave.  If they are laid back go with the flow people they are in bed sleeping either by not setting an alarm or reaching out and having shut it off thinking they had time.  \n\nThe fact is that your feelings and schedule are as important to you as everyone else\u2019s is to them.  With that, since they don\u2019t perfectly align, compromise is needed.  Compromise and acceptance on both sides.  Have a safe trip home.", "NTA autistic or not. This is rude. They knew what time you wanted to leave today and told you that they would make you breakfast and what they do/are doing is rude. You're their guest you're not crashing there for your convenience, you're visiting them.", "Have you ever thought that you going to bed early is rude to them? They are night owls. You know this. They are not rude unless you are rude by going to bed so early. \n\nSo it is NAH but leaning towards  Y T A. You are the guest. You adjust your schedule to theirs. They don't adjust to you. \n\nWake them up and say you are heading out and leave. \n\nIf you can't do that because of your rigidity to schedule them, don't stay with them.", "My wife and I both work and lie in at the weekend. When friends are over, we still lie in and may get up around 10:00. I think beyond that is a bit rude, but not outrageous. I have friends that stay and get up really early. Every time they are over, we get up and they\u2019re gone already. None of care or mind about that. You know your friends and how they behave and it\u2019s not going to change. I would leave and text them. Maybe consider not visiting so often if it bothers you so much.", "NTA for this morning, it is indeed kind of rude on their side, but in general do try to be more tolerant of daily schedules way different than yours. So what if they put on movies past midnight and sleep in when they get the chance? \n\n Going to sleep at 8-9 and waking up before 6 is really not everyone's thing. However, for the day of your departure they should have made an exception and set an alarm for at least 10-11.", "NAH - just sounds like you are on two different sleep schedules", "YTA. Sounds like you knew who they were and what their habits are (were) long before you went there, yet you continue to go back multiple times a year. Insanity: doing the same thing over and over, expecting different results.", "NTA. Your friends are rude and immature. \n\nWhen you act as host to a guest, you do things on your guest's schedule whenever possible/reasonable. \n\nYou were crystal clear about when you needed to leave. They just don't care.\n\nThat said, this is now a known quantity. If you go back there to visit again, you should expect exactly this. If you expect different behavior from them, pester them, and get disappointed when they don't conform, you will become an asshole.", "NTA those plans are important for you and if they are really good friends they should appreciate you there.", "YTA\n\nHonestly you know their habits, they know yours. You are good enough friends that I would let it slide. \n\nJust as your aren't changing your sleep schedule to accommodate them, it's unreasonable to expect them to do the same for you. \n\nI agree it's a bit disappointing on your last day, but then again you are good enough friends and they see you (and HOST you) a few times a year, so it's not like you need a sending off event before seeing you in a few years.\n\nMy point is - yes you are getting a bit worked up over something you would do differently, but clearly is not something they do. It does NOT reflect how they feel about you are a friend/ guest.", "Ima say NTA for the last day. \n\nIt's hard to change your sleep schedule for multiple days but I think they should have set an alarm as a one off before you left to say goodbye", "Why are you getting mad at your friends for acting according to their natures? You know who they are, it\u2019s how they\u2019ve always been and is likely who they\u2019ll be for many years to come (until older age starts to set in). I get that their schedule is not to your liking but you know it\u2019s their schedule before you show up, so what\u2019s the point in getting mad about it? In future, let them know what time you\u2019ll be doing things (like leaving your last day) and if they aren\u2019t up for that start time, you\u2019ll do it on your own - including leaving before they wake up to make breakfast if needs must. It\u2019s just not worth the effort you\u2019re putting into being mad when you know this is their nature. NAH", "While you can't dictate their sleep schedule, I agree it's quite rude they couldn't even get up to see you off... I would maybe try to mention it", "NTA.\n\nI see a few N A H because they can live and sleep how they want, but you have company. Company who you don't see often and now gave you a time they want to leave by. It's definitely an A move to not even set an alarm to make sure you have enough time to do the things you said you would (I.e. pancakes).", "YTA. You know how they are and their schedule is fine. When you visit you need to plan group events ONLY around the times you know you\u2019re both awake. You shouldn\u2019t expect them to change their schedule to suit you.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re trying to force you to stay up late even if they themselves are active late. \n\nYes it\u2019s annoying they said they would make breakfast, but it sounds like everyone knows that\u2019s unlikely. It doesn\u2019t sound like they\u2019re acting out to hurt you.\n\nNext time tell them: I have to leave by noon. If you get up before then, let\u2019s grab breakfast. If you don\u2019t, no worries. I\u2019ll see myself out and see you next time.\n\nMy parents are early risers and often left my house before I woke up (around 9:30-10am on Sundays), because they couldn\u2019t wait and I didn\u2019t want to set an alarm on my weekends.\n\nIt\u2019s not a big deal.", "im gonna against the grain and say YTA. this is their home. they can sleep whenever theyd like, one of the benefits of having your own space is doing what you want, when you want. expecting people to change their sleep schedule for you is pretty selfish.", "YTA\n\nThis is who they are. This is their schedule. Do you know who they are, you said you\u2019ve been friends for 15+ years. Deciding that your way of life is more important than their way of life is kind of an asshole move on your part.", "YTA.  Don\u2019t expect the people who are hosting you as a houseguest to adjust their sleeping habits to get up early for you.  It sounds like they have good intentions and planned to get up and have a goodbye breakfast with you.  Sometimes poor late night decisions wreck morning plans.  Friends should be understanding about this especially when they are a houseguest.", "You are complaining. They feed and transport you. You do you and let them do them. If you need a ride and its important dont rely on them. Find someone else. I know maybe not possible so if not then all you can do is set boundries and specific timeframes if they cant compromise then deal with it or stay home.\n Schedules are nice but if you dont have any prior commitments besides unpack and relax then id not care about taking you home exactly when you want either because my time is just as valuable as yours. Sticky situation but i didnt read anything about you having to commit to anything while they work and have to use their free time as best they can.  Even if the schedule went perfect things cant always go as planned. \n\nIdk if i misunderstood but if you drove yourself then you are hardcore the asshole. Leave when you need to or dont. But stop complaining.", "Why take thing\u2019s personally? If you put aside your expectations and just understand that these are your friends and this is the way they are I\u2019m sure nobody would care if you woke up and left at 8am. You\u2019re an adult.

Do you ever host them in your home? I don\u2019t go visit people and expect them to change their routine for me. I\u2019m in their home so I need to go with the flow. If you\u2019re on a schedule leave them a note thanking them for letting you stay and pick up breakfast on the road. I don\u2019t think people understand what visiting people in their home involves. As you said, they house and feed you. They sometimes pay for entertainment they otherwise wouldn\u2019t have done. When you leave they have to wash bedding and clean the room you stayed in.", "NAH - This is who they are; this is how they live. If you find the way they live frustrating (and I understand why you do), then either:\n1. Keep things as they are and continue to be frustrated,\n2. Ask them to change, which I suspect they won\u2019t, though they may say that they\u2019ll try,\n3. Change your approach: plan on doing fun solo activities in the first part of the day, and then meeting them for group activities in the second part of the day,\n4.

There is no moral superiority to going to bed early and waking up early. Get over yourself.", "If your friend makes the effort to see you and takes that much time and energy to do so, the least you can do is get out of bed a few hours early to spend actual time with them. This seems like all effort comes from OP's side, and none come from the friends. If I drove 5 hours to see friends that I made plans with, and had to constantly be waiting for them to bother with me, I'd leave soon and not come back. Especially when they can't even bother to keep their plans the day I leave. That's more than just rude, and it definitly makes them ahs\n\nOP, your friends are unreliable.

You expect the people who are hosting you to follow your schedule in their home?", "YTA\n\nYou're a guest in their home AND you knew their schedule.\n\nDo you seriously think they should change their lives for you?\n\nJust leave a not on the kitchen counter and go home.", "Write a lovely thank you note and contact them when you get home. Nta", "Make some pancakes and knock on the door and tell them goodbye at 12 on the dot. You need to give them exact times.", "NTA\n\nYour friends have a very unhealthy lifestyle that will eventually catch up with them and sounds like it already is, if they're making plans and then sleeping in it's not a sleep schedule thing, that's just being inconsiderate. They aren't really \"going with the flow\" if they don't accommodate you, frankly it seems like it's just their excuse to be lazy. I've no doubt quite a few YTAs are from people with a similar lifestyle and are just defensive about it. \n\nPersonally I'd be upset if I slept through seeing a friend off, especially if I had something like a special breakfast planned, however it doesn't seem to bother your friends much which points towards it being selfish. They're definitely laid back, but they're not really going with your flow, rather they're expecting you to conform to theirs. This is probably going to sound mean but staying up late and only getting a few hours sleep is the sort of behaviour you should have grown out of by your late 20s, the fact they're proud of this way of living points to their immaturity. \"Sorry I'm late because bed was too comfortable\" is something I'd expect to hear from a teenager or college student, not a mature adult. Nothing wrong with the occasional all-nighter or late night out, but if you're just watching movies or youtube then that points to poor impulse control. It would be fine if they could stay up late and not have it effect them, but they're sleeping in so late that it's causing them to miss out on opportunities which is the definition of unhealthy.", "NTA \n\nBut I wouldn't keep these feelings bottled up. I would have a gentle conversation with them about it. I sleep in too, and so does my husband. We've got two little kids though so during the week I'm up and take the older to school(6am) When I get home, he is gone to work and if the baby allows it, we will go back to sleep until around 930-10. \n\nBut the weekends? Nah haha we sleep in. So do the kids mostly. Even if the 4 year old wakes up, she just grabs her tablet and chills in bed. \n\nBUT, of we have company and have plans, im usually the first one up. \n\nI totally get that this can be recieved as rude. \n\nAgain, I'd just talk to them and explain how you're feeling.", "NTA but they probably find it equally as annoying that they try to hang out with you and you want to be in bed by 9. You could\u2019ve made an effort to stay up late. They could\u2019ve made an effort to wake up early.. in fact I changed my mind ESH", "ETA, your friends are inconsiderate of you being there to visit and not making an effort to spend more time with you, but at the same time you went to visit knowing their lifestyle is more laid back and carefree.", "Info: did they invite you, or did you ask to visit", "YTA. Just leave if you need to? I don't get it. If you visit and stay so often, it isn't reasonable to expect them to change their circadium rhythm for you....I mean, you aren't interested in doing that either, why would you expect them to?\n\nthey are who they are. Take it or leave it.", "NAH\n\nThey\u2019re entitled to do their thing, you\u2019re entitled to be annoyed.  Just enjoy the time they do give you.  I think if you ever did say something you it would end up being counterproductive.", "No OPs friends are the AH , rude, inconsiderate, and ungrateful I wouldnt be surprised if thay was shocked op didn\u2019t want to be friends anymore", "This. Do what you need to do, around or aligned with what they need to do. Why don\u2019t they come visit you sometimes? I just find it\u2019s easier to do your own thing and not expect things of each other. And enjoy your time together when you are all awake!", "They invited me! We have been best friends for 15+ years and they have always told me, \u201cOur home is your home.\u201d", "Do you mind sharing the specific words they used to invite you to this visit? My son is autistic so I\u2019m just trying to get some context because he interprets things a bit differently.", "That doesn\u2019t mean they are saying they\u2019ll change their schedule for you.\n\nDo you visit or travel with any other friends? You have to work with each person\u2019s schedule and plan around it.", "We saw a concert together for this trip. It\u2019s a given that I have a place to stay in her house since we have been best friends for 15+ years. We got the tickets and it was kind of just understood that I was going to stay with her, no explicit \u201cinvite\u201d necessary. She has always told me her home is my home.", "Got it. You can lower your expectations of visiting and let it go, or you can let them know how you feel and hope that they make changes.", "It does sounds like OP wants to visit her friends.  But that could also be an opportunity to explore a new place both with and without those friends.", "Generally no. But people who you consider to be your best friends\u2026I don\u2019t know, I would do it."]}
