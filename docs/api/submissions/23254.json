I received mine a couple of months ago and accepted being a groomsman about a month ago. I\u2019m super stoked to be there for there for him and the wedding will also be a vacation for my fianc\u00e9 and I. \n\nMy little brother also got engaged last year and they have been planning a wedding but not sharing many details with family. My mom, my aunt, and myself told him multiple times that I would be unavailable the weekend of my best friends wedding. To not leave any confusion he was told the exact date multiple times. Well we all recently got the save the date cards from my little brother and it\u2019s the same date as my best friends wedding. When my mom opened up the card in front of him her heart dropped and she said \u201cwhat about your brother\u201d to which he replied \u201coh he will figure it out\u201d. \n\nTurns out he never told his fianc\u00e9 about this date so she has been planning without knowing this. Now he is claiming that he forgot about multiple people telling him multiple times and is pushing the line that since he is family I should bail on the other wedding and go to his. I tried to look into even making both work because I genuinely want to be at my brother\u2019s wedding. I\u2019m not not going out of spite or because I have a random trip, concert tickets, or it\u2019s someone\u2019s wedding I\u2019m just going to. This is my best friends wedding that I\u2019ve known for over 25 years. When I told my brother I couldn\u2019t make it he gave me the line of \u201cbut I\u2019m your brother\u201d which really sucked to hear. If I could be at both I would be and I\u2019m sure he is sad but I just can\u2019t be there. \n\nThis has caused more drama in the family than I want. His future FIL called my mom and said that I should skip my friends wedding and go to the family wedding because family comes first. My mom, myself, and my aunt all disagree. He was told multiple times by multiple people and whether it\u2019s because he messed up by not telling his fianc\u00e9 or that he forgot it apparently was not important enough to him to have me there so he picked one of the two weekends all next year I said I couldn\u2019t be at. The family wants him to change the date of the wedding and I have told him to just go through with it and have a great wedding and that I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be there. So AITA for keeping a commitment to my best friend and not wavering on it because of a family members disregard?\n\nEdit: Wanted to clarify something after someone asked for info. We did not directly tell his fianc\u00e9. She is generally a recluse and hasn\u2019t been communicating with myself, my mom, or my aunt about the wedding just doing her own thing. We just assumed my brother would tell her. Now in hindsight we should\u2019ve just told her.\n\nEdit 2: Thank you so much for all the kind words everyone! Haven\u2019t been called an asshole yet so that\u2019s a good sign. I\u2019m going to stick to my guns on this one and go to my friends wedding. My mom called my little brother and after urging him to change the wedding date he told her to \u201cfuck off\u201d but apparently after talking to my aunt they might consider it. It is what it is, but again thank you for taking the time out of your day to reach out!\n\nUPDATE: Brother called me and started crying asking if there was any way I could make his wedding. After saying no he dropped the \u201cbut I\u2019m your brother\u201d line again. So he was trying to guilt trip me one last time and make me choose him over my best friend. He then called back 15 minutes later saying he had talked to the caterer, Dj, and venue that morning and they are now looking at a weekend a month earlier now. So he knew that was an option they were exploring and he still tried to guilt trip by crying and dropping the line. Turns out I can make the new weekend so I\u2019ll be there but nothing is set in stone yet and they are calling immediate family to confirm it works for everyone.", "created_utc": 1690464202, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15b1tan/aita_for_going_to_my_best_friends_wedding_over_my/", "score": 773, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's always rude to cancel an existing commitment just because you get a better offer later, so having accepted the invitation to your friends wedding it would be very rude to cancel (obviously cancelling due to something outside your control, like illness or a death in the family, is different)  YWBTA if you cancelled on your friend. \n\nPlus, you are a groomsman, so backing out would cause more of an issue than if you were 'just' a guest.\n\nAND you told your brother, as did others, that you were not available that weekend.\n\nIt sounds as though the people who are suggesting you should go to your brother's wedding are not aware of the facts - (also, family comes first works both ways. If it was important to your brother to have you there, he would have made sure he checked the date with you before it was finalized them, and/or would change the date to ensure that you can be there)\n\nIn my experience, couples  usually speak to the key people before finalizing a date - I my sister and her husband actually moved their wedding from the provisional date they had, because otherwise the best man wasn't available. My closest friend spoke tome, and to her own immediate family, and her husband spoke to his, before fixing the date, to make sure we were all available.\n\n(My brother didn't, but he got married just after covid lockdowns ended and explained that they had basically been told 'this is the only available date, we need a definite answer in the next 10 minutes or it goes to the next person in the queue, so their invitations were on the basis that they would absolutely understand if anyone couldn't make it (and also came with a warning that they might need to suddenly un-invite people if the rules about how many people were allowed changed again!) \n\nIt sounds as though your brother dropped the ball on this one and he / his in laws want to blame you instead of him, or make the problem go away y dumping it on another Family.", "Absolutely NTA.

You made a huge commitment to you friend to be in his wedding well before your brother planned his! Your brother & his fianc\u00e9 can\u2019t keep the date and not have you there or they can change it if they want you to be there so badly. Either way, this is on your brother.", "NTA. Go to your best friends wedding. If you and your brother were close it would MAYBE be a different story. But you not knowing the date until you received a save the date tells me that there's no closeness. At least not enough to skip the other wedding.", "NTA. Being family and brothers isn't a one way street. It also means for him to make sure to pick a date that makes sure you'll be there.

I think this is the third post I've read in the past few days where someone has been told specifically when a member of the family, that supposedly *has* to be there, isn't available and still plans the event on that day. Very rarely do things not line up when an event is planned properly - as in, \"Okay so Uncle Robert can't make it June 22nd, Aunt Lydia is recovering from surgery for six weeks starting mid May, your grandparents have that thing in Boca over the July 4th holiday. So that leaves only the 1st Saturday in February and the 3rd Saturday in August that the chapel still has openings that fits everyone's schedule.\" It honestly isn't hard when you have the information in front of you.\n\nSounds like brother figured that he could ignore what everyone was telling him, and now is backpeddling while laying on a guilt trip. Too bad. If he wanted his brother there, he would have made sure to tell his fiance the dates OP could not be there.", "NTA.

You had a full prior commitment to your best friend's wedding because you received this first before your brother's.

But it's not your fault because many people already heard that you received the invitation to your best friend's wedding before your brother's. If your brother can't keep up with respecting anything related to you, don't go. Enjoy your best friend's wedding.", "NTA, he was told multiple times. No excuse imo for forgetting. Besides, he should maybe also think about the fact that you could potentially have money invested into your best friend's wedding already, especially since it is an international wedding.", "> \u201cbut I\u2019m your brother\u201d\n\nWell, that means he's your brother too. Why didn't he process a simple \"I won't be available on these dates\" and plan accordingly.?\n\nIf I'm not wrong, he intentionally chose the same date so you'll dump the best friend's wedding and go to his. Which is why, I think, he said you'll (OP) figure it out when your family expressed their shock at the date.\n\nNTA. Make sure to talk to him that you do love him but you promised your friend so you won't be able to attend his wedding if the date is not changed (something you don't *expect* him to do).", "You are NTA and your brother is, but I cannot understand why everyone is giving your brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9e so much of a pass here.\n\nIt was incredibly poor planning to pick a wedding date and begin the actual arrangements without making sure that the small handful of people you would absolutely positively want to be there (parents, grandparents, siblings, etc) have the date available.\n\nA \u201csave the date\u201d card is for people you DON\u2019T talk to all of the time. It shouldn\u2019t be the first time immediate family hears about your date decision.", "NTA. Your brother did this on purpose to mess you up.  Don\u2019t go to his wedding. He made a choice. He doesn\u2019t care enough for you, and is acting stupid with the, \u201cbut I\u2019m your brother\u201d crap! Do t fall for his nonsense and have a great time at your best friends wedding!!!!", "NTA. Personally, I\u2019m wondering if your mom or aunt told him that your best friend\u2019s wedding was international, like you said. Even though you responded to a comment about him being jealous about you and your best friend\u2019s relationship, I had a different takeaway: that he\u2019s insecure, and setting you up to make you miss out on an incredible trip internationally. But I don\u2019t know if you guys have been out of your country before, or if he has, to say anything definitive.\n\nBottom line, he\u2019s being a dick, there\u2019s no excuse for him \u201cforgetting\u201d. This is not a \u201cfriend over family\u201d thing, your best friend of \u201cover 25 years\u201d should be considered your family too. Plus you are a groomsman, which to me takes priority. If you haven\u2019t explained it already, here it is simply: 1) You committed to your best friend\u2019s wedding first, 2) you and your mom and aunt explained to him multiple times, 3) you reminded him so many times because his wedding IS important to you, and 4) if it was so important for you to be there (you\u2019re not a groomsman for your brother too right?), he could have paid attention to your valid concern. \n\nHe reminds me of the men in my family and it\u2019s pisses me off (because it\u2019s triggering). He\u2019s childish for avoiding blame with a cliche cop out. And even more immature for turning the in laws and the rest of your family against you.\n\nThis isn\u2019t on you! Go to the best friends please!", "NTA\n\nYou told your brother that you were unavailable that day. His lack of either involvement in the date picking process or communication with his fianc\u00e9 is not your problem to fix! Reneging on your commitment to your best friend would be an AH move.\n\nDepending on the timing of the two weddings, there might be a chance your brother could stream it and you could still watch, even if not in person.", "\"I have told him to just go through with it and have a great wedding and that I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t be there.\"\n\nThis is the response. For everyone. Express your regrets directly to his fiance in a card or note, or call. Do not engage further. Do not blame or accept responsibility for the situation. Just regrets and go to the wedding you've had planned for yonks. \n\nYour brother, whether he's done this intentionally or through carelessness, is the only TA in this mess. He's attempting to guilt you into losing a friendship of 25 years over his issues. Just no. \n\nAnd if he continues to pull the family card, tell him that \"family\" would have considered other folks important dates that they'd been told of and not used \"family\" as a cover for their own fuck up. Tell only him this, and find a much gentler way of saying to the new relatives - it's not their fault either, even if they're on board the guilt train with your brother. \n\nNTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your brother chose to \"forget\" and not communicate w his fiance, he can deal.", "NTA and it\u2019s clear your bro is jealous of your bf.", "oh no, the consequences of his actions. or lack thereof. \n\nthis is what we call natural consequences. NTA", "NTA. Your brother needed to tell her.", "Your are NTA but just be prepared for retaliation in the future", "NTA If family comes first why didn't your brother make sure you could be there, if it's so important to him? It's \"family first\" when he wants something from you.", "Absolutely not, remember family are the ones your surround yourself with not the blood running through your veins, -Jackie Chan", "NTA. You committed to your friend's wedding before your brother announced the date of his. One thing I would suggest is to have your mother communicate to your brother's fiancee - either directly or through her parents - that brother was told MULTIPLE times that there was ONE date that you would not be available. If he \"forgot\" about being repeatedly told the date, he probably \"forgot\" to ever mention it to his fiancee.", "NTA - some people (your bro) will not be told and assume that other people will always accommodate their clearly unreasonable demands  - they need to get over themselves. Enjoy your best friend\u2019s wedding.", "NTAH, you made a commitment to attend your long time friends wedding as a groomsman and your brother got mad or something.  This garbage about BUT IT'S FAAAAMMMLLEEEEEEEE, just really makes me sick.  Regardless of what your brothers future FIL says, no, family doesn't come first.  I love a lot of my family and am LC or NC with a lot of my close family because of their attitudes or nasty habits, like chain smoking and heavy drinking around kids...  Good luck and enjoy the wedding!", "Easy NTA. How did he forget multiple people telling multiple times the exact date you couldn\u2019t come?", "NTA, I never understood this, \"Hey!  I can come anyday to your wedding except this one day\"  \"Oh hey bro It's on this one day\"  \"I told you not that day\"  \"but FaMiLy\"", "You made the effort to ensure you could do both and your commitment to your best friend should be respected. The situation obviously sucks but you\u2019re making the right call. Not all things need to be cancelled/changed just because your brother chose that date (for example if you had a surgery booked, you\u2019d still be fine to skip the wedding). NTA.", "Don\u2019t change your plans and I hope both weddings are amazing for all parties involved.", "You're apparently more important to your friend than your brother.", "Nta.  I get the impression that brother is jealous of your friend. Maybe this was on purpose, him thinking he could force you to chose him.", "Then you really had no rational basis to believe he would tell his fiance. Your brother apparently forgets to convey important information routinely, why would this be different?\n\nPersonally, I think your brother did the wrong thing. If he has to write it down in permanent marker on his forehead he should have. However, I still think you should go to his wedding. I'm middle age now and while I can say I've had some absolutely great friends who have truly been there for me in my life and while I have certainly fought terribly with some of my siblings at points it was in the end always my siblings who had to do the heavy lifting when things got bad not my friends. This isn't a criticism of my friends, they are great ppl who have don't amazing things but they weren't the ones who helped care for my toddler after the traumatic birth of my husband and my second child left me hospitalized and bed bound. \n\nI have at times chosen to attend friends events over family (I have 4 sisters so it's happened a few times) at the time it seemed like the right decision. I regret every single incident now. My friends are great but they have their own lives and own families. When something terrible happens in mine they can't put there's on hold to help, siblings (if it's a good relationship) do even if it's really inconvenient and hard. They may not be my favourite ppl - because they are forced upon me rather than chosen - but they do the truly heavy lifting.", "He didn't care enough about you to remember the date and let his fianc\u00e9e know that this date is off limits? And now he tries to show the 'family first' card to blame you? What a shitty behaviour. I don't see why you should cancel your friend's wedding to accommodate this.", "Exactly. DNA is just a circumstance of birth and doesn\u2019t necessarily mean anything.  If people that share your DNA are kind, loving people that facilitate healthy relationships, that\u2019s great. But IME, that doesn\u2019t happen too often. I think people put way too much emphasis on biological family when so many of them treat those same people horribly.", "He might be a total dunderhead who doesn't listen to others but hearing the same date over and over again semi-sunk in and made him think that was a good date.\n\nI consistently use my phone for reminders and notes (because I want to make sure I remember important things like birthdays and I am sooooo terrible at it, but I know that and work to mitigate it), and it blows me away how terrible so many people are at that sort of thing. You have a fucking machine that does all the pesky work for you in your pocket 95% of your awake time and you can't tell it to remind you of basic shit?!", "First thing I thought. Especially his comment when the Mom found out of \"he'll figure it out.", "NTA.\n\nGo to your friend's wedding. I find it really odd that that is the date she picked that date and he didn't double check with you before having the cards printed. I feel like he knew and figured you'd bail on your friend. Now he has to deal with a fianc\u00e9e' who is blaming him rightfully and may be rethinking marrying him. And she should.\n\nI hope you have a great time at your friend's wedding.", "NTA, go to your friend's wedding. My best friend would have been best man at my wedding, but he already said he was going to his sister's wedding and the venue we picked only had that date, so he missed my wedding and had an okay time at mine because his family guilted him and I was sorry he couldn't come but understood (and it's never been a problem for our relationship).\n\nYou already committed to going and frankly, it sounds like you'd rather go to your friends wedding if you had to choose, so just go. You told him a date you were unavailable.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's no different than if you had a work event or cancer treatment or were receiving the Nobel prize: you are unavailable on that day and told him about it several times...", "NTA.  You gave plenty of notice of the dates you would not be available.  He chose to ignore that. HE is half of the bridal party.  DO NOT think you should have told her.  \n\nTherefore, you won't be at his wedding. \n\nHave a great time at your friend's wedding!!", "NTA\n\nthere wasn't too much to indicate it, but I have a nagging feeling little brother is jealous of your relationship with your best friend.\n\nCould be that he did it on purpose to make you choose expecting you to fold because \"FaMilY\". I find it hard to believe he just happened to forget something that was repeated over and over. Even if he did forget to tell his fianc\u00e9e, it's suspicious he didn't at least recognize the date when she proposed it.\n\nSo NTA, don't give in.", "NTA", "NTA. Your brother is an entitled AH. He was told by multiple people the two days you would not be available. He chose to ignore that and told his mother to \"fuck off\".  Have fun at your friend's wedding.", "\u201cBut you\u2019re my brother\u201d yes! Exactly! And yet it wasn\u2019t important enough for him to pick ANY other date to ensure that you could go. Come now. NTA", "NTA.  His failure to plan is not your emergency.", "NTA hopefully all works out and perhaps brother will be able to adjust date", "NTA, clearly \"he'll figure it out\" meant he knew exactly what he was doing IMHO. Does he hate your friend? Was maybe your friend kind of a jerk to him in your misspent youth? Or maybe did your mom not \"make\" you play with him when your friend was over, and otherwise you wouldn't play with him or something like that? I'm just saying there must be some simmering resentment about your friendship or something, maybe?", "NTA. Wait your brother told your mom to F off?! Because he screwed up? Go to your friend\u2019s wedding. With your brothers attitude he will be divorced soon enough and you can go to the next one", "Yeah, NTA, your brother is TA.  What is the deal with the noncommunicative couple, she is mute and he deliberately picks the date that he knows you won't be there just to spin up drama?  I mean come on, he was told multiple times by everyone. He is being a little sh\\*t", "Agreed. He dropped the ball and it\u2019s his cross to bare.", "I have friends that I would rescue from a fire before relatives so....", "Or option C, he can't handle being told to do something and will automatically do the opposite just to prove he doesn't take orders from anyone.  My BIL is like this.  We invited him to a day long event where it would be very hot and sunny, amplified by the surroundings and suggested he wear light weight light colored clothing.  He showed up in long black jeans and a black long sleeve shirt.  On vacation we told him we were going on an all day hike (7am - 7pm) and that he was welcome to join us on but he had to bring a pack of some sort to carry his own water and food.  He showed up at the rental house without one then got upset we left for the hike without him.  He was hosting the family holiday, we had offered to bring some snacks because we would be there all day.  He assured us he would have plenty of food.  Which I suppose he did but he didn't serve the first bite until 7 hours into the 10 hour day.", "DNA is just a circumstance at birth...\nTucking that statement away in my back pocket. Genius.", "Right? In a case of emergency or need, I know that I have friends that would drop everything and come. Can't say that about some of my close relatives. If I had to chose between them, DNA would not be a factor in my choice.", "If there is someone you really want at your wedding, you figure out what dates they can be there. If there are dates that don\u2019t work, you accept they can\u2019t come or you move it. NTA. Also once you\u2019ve accepted it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s your third cousin or your best friend - it\u2019s pretty rude in my books to back out after accepting an invitation. You may have gotten a better offer but that\u2019s either on the second inviter for being late or on you for accepting too fast when you were undecided. NTA", "Your brother abrogated all responsibility in the lead up to this and just put all that responsibility on his gf without giving her the info she needed. This is HIS fuck up to resolve and yet again he\u2019s shirking the responsibility to fix things on to other people.\n\nHe needs to \u2018man up\u2019 and fix this himself.", "Definitely NTA.  Your brother is one for causing all this drama.", "NTA. \n\nYou did everything you could to make it work. It just turns out that it can't. It might not have been malicious in your brother's part, just forgetful, but these are the consequences of his actions. \n\nAlso, wtf at him telling his mother to fuck off? If I did that, I wouldn't have to worry about the wedding date anymore because it'd be a funeral", "NTA, if family was so important, he would have passed along the very important dates you couldn't attend to whoever was planning the wedding.", "Also your brother told your mom to f* iff for asking him to consider changing the date.... The apple has fallen far drom tvhe tree after all.", "I can\u2019t claim credit for it. But it resonates with me as well and is a favorite saying along with \u201ctradition is just peer pressure from dead people\u201d. I always keep these in mind when there is talk of \u201cbecause family\u201d or \u201cbecause tradition\u201d.", "Idk because he expect his grown adult of a brother to communicate that critical info to his wife ? So now expecting the bare minimum is too much ? Jesus. Plenty of time regarding wedding family from each side communicate with their own family member. And guess what that normally. works.", "I mean, if I have critical info that needed to be shared, I would make sure all those involved knows that critical info and not rely on the game of telephone to get to the people it needs to go to. \n\nI would be too anxious to have other people rely my critical info to where it needs to go.", "I\u2019m sorry expecting the brother  to communicate to his soon to be wife is enough. Not only that but him knowing is enough as he was present when they chose and picked the date of the wedding. The behaviour you mention is not the norm. Even for family dinner they call one of the spouse extending an invite to both so the person  can you know use his mouth to talk to his or her spouse. Even wedding invitations addressed to married couples are to Mr and mrs not two separate invitations", "Though, in my opinion, family dinners isn't really on the same level as a family member's wedding so....I get that for a family dinner, sure, that could be the norm......but a wedding, that's a bit bigger deal.\n\nWith a wedding invitation, don't both members of said couple would see the contents of the invitation?\n\nBut agree to disagree, I guess.", "\u201cI\u2019m your brother.
