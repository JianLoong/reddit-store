My wife work as an administrator for the hospital group that owns the children hospital but doesn\u2019t work for the children hospital. She told me their CEO expected all of the administrators to go to mingle with the donors and asked if I wanted to come. I wanted to but declined because I had a dinner meeting the same night. That night came and we went to our separate functions. I got home first and went straight to bed because I was tired from my full day. The next day when we woke up, everything was normal as we talked about our night. Somewhere in the middle of our conversation, my wife told me that we donated $5,000 to the children hospital.\n\nI was stunned. I asked her to repeat it just to make sure I heard her correctly. I didn\u2019t remember us talking about any donations much less a $5,000 donation. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to say. \n\nI told my wife while it looks like we can afford the donation right now, our financials took a big hit with this economy and looks to be taking a bigger hit next year. The company I work for have been holding high level meetings about our clients not renewing contracts because they\u2019re anticipating their own slowdown. There\u2019s a slim but real chance I might lose my job next year if the economy and our business doesn\u2019t pick up. This is not the time to be giving away $5,000.\n\nShe argued that she already made the donation so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I went to check our account and saw it hasn\u2019t been withdrawn so went to the bank and opened another account then transferred my portion of the account leaving only her money. I transferred my direct deposits into the new account, leaving our joint account with only her money and direct deposit. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much more than $5,000 so once the children hospital donation hits that account, she won\u2019t have enough money left to buy a cup of coffee.\n\nI told her what I did and that she made the donation without talking to me about it so it\u2019s coming out of her money, not mine. She said I can\u2019t do that because both of our names are on the donation brick (they put the donors name on a brick then use those bricks to build part of the new wing) and she can\u2019t back out of it without looking foolish to the rest of the executive team. I told her she should have thought of that before giving away money without talking to me first. She argued it\u2019s for a good cause to which I argued making sure we\u2019re not homeless next year is a better cause.\n\nI\u2019m standing my ground but she\u2019s gotten her family involved. Her father called me to have a man to man talk about me being a better man by supporting my wife and helping children. They\u2019re making me out to be some kind of monster because we can afford it right now.\n\nAm i monster?", "created_utc": 1669722820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7rye5/aita_for_refusing_to_go_through_with_a_donation/", "score": 3145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not sensible to spend that much money unless you are very rich and won't feel the loss of such a big amount.", "That's a third of my 401k! Yikes!!", "5000 dollars would make a pretty big difference in my life right now", "This. NTA. You agreed to nothing. She is free to donate what she likes from her money. You can contribute if you like but this donation is totally on her. \n\nCould never would never spend $5k without talking to my spouse. There are some issues of respect and control with your wife that need to be addressed.", "Yep.  I think this info is critical, and it doesn\u2019t look forthcoming.  But added to that:\n\nHow did he determine what amount in the joint account was his?  How do they determine what money goes into the joint account?  Does one of them have insurance premiums and HSA contributions that benefit both of them or estimated tax payments that are a mutual liability coming out of their paycheck whereas the other doesn\u2019t?  Is the donation deductible in a way that will benefit you?\n\nHave you ever made a $5000 or more purchase without consulting your spouse?\n\nThere are so many things that inform this that I don\u2019t take for granted.  I\u2019ve met people who would drop $10k on a trip unilaterally but get pissed that their partner donated $2k to charity.  So\u2026yeah.", "I agree with this. It also seems like if the wife is on the executive team and he\u2019s on the edge of losing his job then seems like she has the more secure career and making a donation could be necessary to not only secure her current role but upward mobility as well. \n\nESH, but this is more likely to hurt OP in the long run. He needs to deal with his insecurities and she needs to better communicate.", "Where did it say that this was their savings account? While it is clear that OP would like to save the money in case of a rainy day, my impression was that this was a joint checking account. It would not be odd at all for a dual income couple where one of those incomes is a hospital administration salary to keep ~$10,000 in a checking account. If it's a checking account and she has access to savings then OP's reaction was likely more of an FU designed to inconvenience/hurt their wife for a few days than an attempt to solve a problem.\n\nPersonally I think there is a lot of important info that has been left out. If your right and she spent half their savings that is a very, very different situation than if she spent half of their available discretionary fund. What their actual salary ranges are, agreed spending limits, who normally spends what all matter too. As does their donation history (if it's a yearly thing that OP expected to forgo without a conversation then that is different than a first time donation, although I'm assuming it was the first time).", "I wonder this all the time too! It's absolutely bonkers that grown adults try to drag their parents into an argument with their SO. Then it's doubly bonkers that the parents actually do it! \n\nIf it were my kid, I'd tell her not my circus, not my monkeys.", "In my own life, I know 1 adult woman, who called another adult woman's father, to complain to him that his daughter hadn't paid her back some money she owed. She was whinging to us that his response had been \"why are you calling me, she handles her own money\". Then she got mad at us when we agreed with him.", "It is 100% an expectation that if you attend an event like this, even as an employee, you should be making a donation.", "I can't tell you the amount of times I've started drafting up an AITA post in my head before stopping and thinking, wait, no, obviously I'm not the asshole here and a very easy solution to this problem is to either talk it out like a normal adult or accept that the other person is going to behave the way they're going to behave and I just don't have to talk to them anymore.\n\nShocking how simple life is when you don't invite drama.", "The way I see it, even if a post here is fake I think it's worth engaging with because unfortunately, abusive relationships are EVERYWHERE. So even if the specific story is made up, someone out there has a very similar story that is real and they might see the post.", "Aha yeah, mine would probably try and ground me, not out of malice but to protect other people from my behaviour. Even though I'm 35.", "I thought he was just referring to a checking account. They may (hopefully?) have more in investment and retirement accounts.", "Or they hoard their finances separately, this is just what they keep in their joint account, and the argument is almost impossibly petty.", "Yeah, but... a typical donation is more like $500, not the $5000 brick. She went overboard.", "If they have separate finances, then the $5K she spent can come out of her savings! ...she doesn't have any separate savings, she was always intending to spending his money on something they cannot afford.", "Oh absolutely. I usually just bid on small silent auction packages that had things I could use in them. Saying she *needed* to make a $5000 donation is a stretch. That she was expected to make *some* kind of contribution, and felt pressured to make a large contribution is not that big of a stretch. And depending on the table she was sat at and the scale of the event, $5k might not have been considered that large of a donation.", "Kids probably interpret adults speaking sharply as \"yelling\" because adults tend to treat children as if THEY are being rude even when they're not.", "I remember crying in my room because my older sisters bullied me and my mom would storm in and start dramatically fake crying - wiping pretend tears from her face and stomping her feet just to mock me."]}
