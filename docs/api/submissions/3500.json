My wife work as an administrator for the hospital group that owns the children hospital but doesn\u2019t work for the children hospital. She told me their CEO expected all of the administrators to go to mingle with the donors and asked if I wanted to come. I wanted to but declined because I had a dinner meeting the same night. That night came and we went to our separate functions. I got home first and went straight to bed because I was tired from my full day. The next day when we woke up, everything was normal as we talked about our night. Somewhere in the middle of our conversation, my wife told me that we donated $5,000 to the children hospital.\n\nI was stunned. I asked her to repeat it just to make sure I heard her correctly. I didn\u2019t remember us talking about any donations much less a $5,000 donation. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to say. \n\nI told my wife while it looks like we can afford the donation right now, our financials took a big hit with this economy and looks to be taking a bigger hit next year. The company I work for have been holding high level meetings about our clients not renewing contracts because they\u2019re anticipating their own slowdown. There\u2019s a slim but real chance I might lose my job next year if the economy and our business doesn\u2019t pick up. This is not the time to be giving away $5,000.\n\nShe argued that she already made the donation so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I went to check our account and saw it hasn\u2019t been withdrawn so went to the bank and opened another account then transferred my portion of the account leaving only her money. I transferred my direct deposits into the new account, leaving our joint account with only her money and direct deposit. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much more than $5,000 so once the children hospital donation hits that account, she won\u2019t have enough money left to buy a cup of coffee.\n\nI told her what I did and that she made the donation without talking to me about it so it\u2019s coming out of her money, not mine. She said I can\u2019t do that because both of our names are on the donation brick (they put the donors name on a brick then use those bricks to build part of the new wing) and she can\u2019t back out of it without looking foolish to the rest of the executive team. I told her she should have thought of that before giving away money without talking to me first. She argued it\u2019s for a good cause to which I argued making sure we\u2019re not homeless next year is a better cause.\n\nI\u2019m standing my ground but she\u2019s gotten her family involved. Her father called me to have a man to man talk about me being a better man by supporting my wife and helping children. They\u2019re making me out to be some kind of monster because we can afford it right now.\n\nAm i monster?", "created_utc": 1669722820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7rye5/aita_for_refusing_to_go_through_with_a_donation/", "score": 341, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm glad you put your foot down.", "Yeah NTA\n\nLike holy shit, especially if you\u2019re in the USA, where hospitals are for profit.\n\nThat kind of money really requires some kind of discussion before hand, especially if you\u2019re taking it out of a joint account.", "NTA. If she is concerned about how she'd look to the executive team than her donation is a matter of pride and not compassion anyways. Donating to worthy causes is great but one shouldn't donate what they can't afford to donate nor should they be spending large amounts of money from joint accounts without their partners input. If she will do this then try and try and bully you for this, maybe you should reconsider your relationship with her or at least have your own bank account for the time being.", "NTA.

I think she did it to cover her embarrassment that you weren't at the event, but donating that much money to your own employer to avoid offending your boss is a huge overreaction.", "YTA the moment you did something so rash. I'm aghast you would do that. She was TA before that moment.", "Nta. However, you may have harmed your marriage.", "ESH.  She shouldn't have made that donation without discussing it with you first.

Because OP said he moved \"his share\" out of their joint account, let's assume that's about half of all the money in there. And according to OP after the donation gets taken out of the account she wouldn't have enough left to buy a cup of coffee so there's barely over 5k left in there now.\n\nIn other words they \"only\" had about 10k in the bank to begin with, while they're doing better than A LOT of people that is most certainly not \"we can spend 5K on a donation\" kind of money.\n\nEven if op's share was double hers that would still only put them at 15k, still not \"we can give away 5k\" kinds of money.", "A common theme in AITA: Third parties who call OP TA for not doing the thing, but refuse to do it themselves.

Not knowing what's going on with OPs work is not a valid reason to donate 5k without discussing it first.\n\n> And if my husband emptied our joint account to set up another only he had access to, my next call would be to an attorney\n\nSure, but presumably you're not the type of person to just randomly give away 5k without talking about it with your husband first, so I'm not really sure what point you're making.\n\nMe personally, an SO thinking they're entitled to make decisions on their own about my/joint money is IMO a perfectly valid reason to transfer my assets to someplace they don't have access to.", "I mean, you seem perfectly fine with your SO donating your money based on you defending ops wife", "Um, of anybody should be calling an attorney, it should be OP. Wife took $5000 from then without consulting each other. That's a big trust issue.", "Exactly this. OP's wife didn't handle the dinner well, but OP pretty much ended the marriage, both by creating separate accounts and by hiding, possibly for months, serious concerns for their future from his wife. On top of that, it appears OP feels like the majority of the money the two of them have belongs to him. While that may be true, I can't help but wonder if it is, given that OP's wife is an executive at a hospital and is likely making 6 figures. \n\nAs OP's wife, I'd have serious trust issues if I were to remain in this relationship.", "I'm in no way excusing her behaviour, but two wrongs don't make a right.\n\nI agree with you that joint accounts come with boundaries, and absolutely she has crossed those boundaries here.\n\nOP has also crossed those boundaries by taking money out of a joint account into an account his wife doesn't have access to. IANAL but this is the type of stuff that happens in divorces which could be construed as theft.\n\nRemember when you talk about consequences that this isn't a parent and child relationship - this is husband and wife. They are equal partners and as such their roles (IMO at least) shouldn't be to discipline one another.\n\nThey're a partnership and if they can't trust each other to pool resources in a joint account they need to separate their finances and consider their long term future.", "I would counter that there is no justification the for the lack of communication their relationship.

This sub is for judging who in a given situation is an asshole. The existing judgements already cover every possible result- no one's hmm while (NAH), everyone's (or most) an asshole (ESH), OP and no one else is an asshole (YTA), and OP is not an assohle but others are (NTA).\n\nAnd yes, I agree, their communication needs to improve on both sides.
