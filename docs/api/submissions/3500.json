{"id": 3500, "submission_id": "z7rye5", "title": "AITA for refusing to go through with a donation to a children\u2019s hospital?", "selftext": "Recently a children\u2019s hospital in our city held a fund raising dinner and auction to raise money to upgrade their cancer wing. My wife work as an administrator for the hospital group that owns the children hospital but doesn\u2019t work for the children hospital. She told me their CEO expected all of the administrators to go to mingle with the donors and asked if I wanted to come. I wanted to but declined because I had a dinner meeting the same night. That night came and we went to our separate functions. I got home first and went straight to bed because I was tired from my full day. The next day when we woke up, everything was normal as we talked about our night. Somewhere in the middle of our conversation, my wife told me that we donated $5,000 to the children hospital.\n\nI was stunned. I asked her to repeat it just to make sure I heard her correctly. I didn\u2019t remember us talking about any donations much less a $5,000 donation. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to say. \n\nI told my wife while it looks like we can afford the donation right now, our financials took a big hit with this economy and looks to be taking a bigger hit next year. The company I work for have been holding high level meetings about our clients not renewing contracts because they\u2019re anticipating their own slowdown. There\u2019s a slim but real chance I might lose my job next year if the economy and our business doesn\u2019t pick up. This is not the time to be giving away $5,000.\n\nShe argued that she already made the donation so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I went to check our account and saw it hasn\u2019t been withdrawn so went to the bank and opened another account then transferred my portion of the account leaving only her money. I transferred my direct deposits into the new account, leaving our joint account with only her money and direct deposit. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much more than $5,000 so once the children hospital donation hits that account, she won\u2019t have enough money left to buy a cup of coffee.\n\nI told her what I did and that she made the donation without talking to me about it so it\u2019s coming out of her money, not mine. She said I can\u2019t do that because both of our names are on the donation brick (they put the donors name on a brick then use those bricks to build part of the new wing) and she can\u2019t back out of it without looking foolish to the rest of the executive team. I told her she should have thought of that before giving away money without talking to me first. She argued it\u2019s for a good cause to which I argued making sure we\u2019re not homeless next year is a better cause.\n\nI\u2019m standing my ground but she\u2019s gotten her family involved. Her father called me to have a man to man talk about me being a better man by supporting my wife and helping children. They\u2019re making me out to be some kind of monster because we can afford it right now.\n\nAm i monster?", "created_utc": 1669722820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7rye5/aita_for_refusing_to_go_through_with_a_donation/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Big spends, no matter on what or how good intentioned, must be discussed with your *partner* if you *share* finances.

Point this out to your wife and ask her to reevaluate her priorities. It is not okay for her to make such a grand financial gesture, which is what it is, with your joint money without your explicit consent. If she still wishes to go ahead with this donation, she can fund it herself and make it only in her name.", "NTA- if it was her own money, fine.

I think there\u2019s a good chance that your wife lied and told them that you agreed and then backed out, or that she hasn\u2019t mentioned that you two genuinely can\u2019t afford such a large donation.

She was totally in the wrong to spend that kind of money on ANYTHING without your agreement; worse on a non-material thing that can't be easily returned. Being a charitable cause doesn't matter.  She was essentially 'stealing' from the marriage. The extended family needs to keep their opinions to themselves - this a two-person marriage. She has shown that she cannot be trusted to look out for the marital assets, and you did what you felt you had to do to protect what money you had left.  Personally, I would have just cancelled the check asap, under the grounds that I hadn't agreed to it.

In effect, it could have been an investment in her continued or increased income. \n\nYour objection was valid. By looting the joint account, you've basically done what people do during divorce to steal money from their partners. You did it to make a point, but unless her name's on the account (in which case, what was the point?), You've also stolen her life savings. Unless you're trying to trigger her filling for divorce, you're a big AH.

Both parties need to agree to donate such a large sum of money. \n\nYour reaction to the situation is imo completely over the top. Opening a new bank account, transferring all of \"your\" money to it and leaving your wife with nothing after the Transaction goes through... that's just an AH move. You are leaving her bankcrupt. The money you took out of the account belongs to both of you.\n\nYou and your wife are both making huge financial decisions without talking to each other.", "ESH", "ESH.

Since she doesn\u2019t want to back out and you don\u2019t want to donate that much, her paying it herself is the only reasonable solution.
