My wife work as an administrator for the hospital group that owns the children hospital but doesn\u2019t work for the children hospital. She told me their CEO expected all of the administrators to go to mingle with the donors and asked if I wanted to come. I wanted to but declined because I had a dinner meeting the same night. That night came and we went to our separate functions. I got home first and went straight to bed because I was tired from my full day. The next day when we woke up, everything was normal as we talked about our night. Somewhere in the middle of our conversation, my wife told me that we donated $5,000 to the children hospital.\n\nI was stunned. I asked her to repeat it just to make sure I heard her correctly. I didn\u2019t remember us talking about any donations much less a $5,000 donation. Honestly, I didn\u2019t know what to say. \n\nI told my wife while it looks like we can afford the donation right now, our financials took a big hit with this economy and looks to be taking a bigger hit next year. The company I work for have been holding high level meetings about our clients not renewing contracts because they\u2019re anticipating their own slowdown. There\u2019s a slim but real chance I might lose my job next year if the economy and our business doesn\u2019t pick up. This is not the time to be giving away $5,000.\n\nShe argued that she already made the donation so there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I went to check our account and saw it hasn\u2019t been withdrawn so went to the bank and opened another account then transferred my portion of the account leaving only her money. I transferred my direct deposits into the new account, leaving our joint account with only her money and direct deposit. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have much more than $5,000 so once the children hospital donation hits that account, she won\u2019t have enough money left to buy a cup of coffee.\n\nI told her what I did and that she made the donation without talking to me about it so it\u2019s coming out of her money, not mine. She said I can\u2019t do that because both of our names are on the donation brick (they put the donors name on a brick then use those bricks to build part of the new wing) and she can\u2019t back out of it without looking foolish to the rest of the executive team. I told her she should have thought of that before giving away money without talking to me first. She argued it\u2019s for a good cause to which I argued making sure we\u2019re not homeless next year is a better cause.\n\nI\u2019m standing my ground but she\u2019s gotten her family involved. Her father called me to have a man to man talk about me being a better man by supporting my wife and helping children. They\u2019re making me out to be some kind of monster because we can afford it right now.\n\nAm i monster?", "created_utc": 1669722820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7rye5/aita_for_refusing_to_go_through_with_a_donation/", "score": 947, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We\u2019re all expected to donate a certain amount to the hospital in accordance with our job positions. As IT staff, I\u2019m expected to donate a small amount (like $100-200/year). My husband is expected to donate more since he\u2019s higher on the chain (like $500-750/year). I know that the admins donate a few grand. This is in the Deep South so this might vary in different areas of the country, but it\u2019s def a thing here at multiple hospitals in the region. We even have contests to see which department raises the most money.\n\nIt\u2019s the type of thing that isn\u2019t required, but people will give you a side eye if they find out that you aren\u2019t donating. But like I said, I think OP is NTA because you can\u2019t donate money you don\u2019t have. At the same time, I could see this impacting her career negatively if she doesn\u2019t cough up the money.\n\nAnd before y\u2019all argue with me, I\u2019m not trying to justify the practice, simply explaining it\u2019s existence in some areas.
