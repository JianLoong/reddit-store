He lives far away from us and we rarely see him. He had just had his second child born a couple of months ago. For the sake of this story since I have two other brothers let's call the (39M) Joe.\n\nBackground before this: My brother Joe is an AH, everyone in the family agrees to that statement. He took money from everyone of us, promised to pay us back but never did.\n\nThe first big one I could remember is he made a loan from a bank and added my mom's name as the person of contact. He never paid the money and the bank kept pestering my mom through hundred of daily calls and even sent her subpoena. My other brother(23 at that time) had to go to the bank and made a promise of good faith to pay for the loan that would be taken from his own account per month. When my parents asked Joe where the money went he spent it on a vacation with his friends. My parents forgave him......until dad died and Joe did it to mom again twice after that. My other brother cut him off and refused to talk to him.\n\nI was 20 at that point and both me and my brothers were asked to forgive him since it's his very special day and he change after meeting his now wife. Me and my siblings didn't want to go to the wedding but mom forced me while the other two strictly refused.\n\nThere's many more to this story but now I'll focus on the current situation.\n\nI am now 25, Joe called me to be his second daughter's godmother. I told him I would think about it when in actuality I didn't want to. We have civil relationship right now and I don't want to ruin that.\n\nReasons why I don't want to: Take note none of these has happened yet but it's my brother and I know him.\n1 - when I become the godmother I know he'll make alot of request financially for my niece\n2- he makes request for gift and won't accept unless its cash\n\nThe second 1 he did to us during his first child's birthday.\n\nMy mom told me the child has nothing to do with what his father did. And surprisingly my other brothers agreed. So I'm left with a dilemma if I should or shouldn't accept it.

Run and steer clear of brother. He is never going to change. Someone to sponge off of.", "NTA.  He seems like he\u2019d make financial requests either way, so that\u2019s probably irrelevant, but you\u2019re not hurting your niece by refusing either since godparents aren\u2019t a necessity.", "NTA. Aside from all the strings you fear will be attached should you take the responsibility, you have no requirement to be a godparent if you don't wish to be. He can ask, you can say no.", "NTA. You aren't close to your brother and his family. The purpose of a godparent is to help guide the child spiritually. You aren't in a position to do that. Say thank you for the thought, but the privilege should go to someone who will be part of their daughter's spiritual life. Just keep repeating that.", "NTA. \n\nYour brother is probably going to use your niece as a weapon regardless if she\u2019s your god daughter or not. If you do want to help your niece out then set very clear expectations and boundaries with your brother. Just know you should never feel guilty for saying no", "NTA. But Godmother doesn't mean open wallet or financial obligations.", "NTA - I don't understand why so many people think their child is God's gift to everyone else. You have the right to not want to be a godmother, it isn't your responsibility.", "Nope Nope and Nope. Brother burns bridges faster than he changes underwear. Just say no and anyone who says otherwise can be the bank for Joe.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nGod parents are the ones who encourage their godchildren in their religion. They help them stay on the path that they share, and their presents are religious oriented. This is not a monetary relationship. You would stand as the godparent at the baptism. You might sponsor after school bible classes in prep for First Communion. That's usually around six or eight years old. Your requirements would be wrapped around religious events and support.\n\nYour brother would be furious if you took him at his word and followed a religious definition of what a godparent is. If he asked for tuition for a catholic school, you'd be paying tuition directly to the school, not HIM. It would take a week of you being a godparent before he'd lose his shit and 'revoke' it.", "NTA.  He\u2019s destroyed your trust, and you know this will open the door for him to guilt you into more financial abuses.  You should never have said you would think about it.  Say No.  You don\u2019t have to give a reason, because NO is a complete sentence.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
