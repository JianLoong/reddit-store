I don\u2019t know why customers ever really accepted this as SOP for a fast food restaurant. I suppose it\u2019s because, in general, people want to be gracious to other people, which is a nice thing.

I certainly don\u2019t support being verbally or physically abusive to staff, but according to your post you were neither.\n\nMultiple times I\u2019ve had to wait inordinate amounts of time, even on small orders.

In the amount of time that you\u2019ve held up the line and inconvenienced everyone else, you could\u2019ve gone inside and gotten your food and saved other people the hassle of having to be behind someone ordering $40 worth of food in a drive through.

If that\u2019s the deal, YTA. What were you hoping to accomplish? Did you think the time you waited 20 minutes they were just fucking with you? Did you imagine that sitting there after you had been asked to move forward was somehow going to get your food to you faster? Of course you\u2019re going to have to wait some unknown length of time. What did you expect? That your food would magically and instantaneously appear the second you finished paying?", "YTA you ordered everything that needed to be deep fried & not kept under food lights.

The food cooks at a pace the employees cannot control so pulling up helps move things along for others who ordered things already made behind ya.

I'm saying that because I've been in queues before where they don't get the people in front to move but then will ask me to, when I may have already been waiting for 10mins before getting to the collection window.  And most of the time there is no one behind me, so I would refuse to move in this case just so they can have their stats looking good.  Your order wasn't anything out of the ordinary.", "YTA. Sorry you had to wait a few extra minutes one time, but yeah, you need to pull up when they ask you to pull up while they fry your corn dogs or whatever. It doesn't seem like a huge order (unless you got 6 orders of tenders and not just one order of 6 tenders) but obviously they had just run out of something you wanted and needed to make a fresh batch. Ultimately giving you a refund because you're impatient probably takes longer than just waiting for your food like a normal person.", "YTA. How hard is it to pull forward? How inconvenient is it, really, to wait 20 minutes? You were called childish because you were childish.", "NTA. I've been asked before to move over (several times at a particular location) and I won't do it again. They continued to serve the other customers without sending them out of line. It wasn't a big order.  I ended up waiting 10-15 minutes until I had to park and go in and get my food. They made no effort to bring out my food. The manager was ticked off at the crew for sending me out of the line. I got barely an apology and no compensation for it. I no longer go back there.", "YTA and a huge one. Your reasoning makes zero sense.", "Hahahaha this is hilarious, but yeah, YTA", "YTA but I gotta respect your bravery if you actually ate that food.", "YTA", "Yta\u2026you move forward so you don\u2019t inconvenience the people behind you.

You really aren\u2019t that important of a person.", "YTA.  The tenders may not have been ready and had to cook, or the corn dog. But you do not have to hold the line up and act like that. I hated it when people acted like that when I worked fast food.   When I worked I never minded giving the refund when people acted like you did.  I would,put on the receipt didn\u2019t want to wait for fresh food.  So when they called customer service to complain we had proof of what happened.

Everyone has to wait for their food sometimes.", "YTA they\u2019re asking you to pull forward so they can make your massive order and continue to help others. This is normal drive thru.
