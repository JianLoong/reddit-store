And you know all the kids would tell their parents they saw a boobie tattoo", "Are the pirates wrestling snakes like Laoco\u00f6n and his sons?", "He's a bit grabby though....", "Like a poorly edited dating app photo.", "Hes so jaunty in those boots\u2026\ud83d\ude02", "I feel like, in comparison to the amount of sexual ones that exist, that's kinda rare though. I know they exist, but this likely isn't one of them.", "Oh no! Not a naked pirate! Whatever will the literal 6 year olds think! It's certainly not like they weren't literally attached to boobs 5 years ago dude, grow up.", "Honestly when I read the title I thought you meant she needed to cover herself up like she was a nudist & refused to wear a bathing suit (that I feel would be reasonable) but the fact it's just a tattoo seems ridiculous that you would tell her she's not invited if she can't cover it. Unless the artwork was obscene & pornographic then maybe it wouldn't be appropriate. What I'm imagining based on your description doesn't sound like it would be that offensive, the kids might giggle if they noticed it at all but like a lot of others on here have said, it's the adults that sexualize nude images & project that onto their children making it seem terrible & wrong. Nudity is completely natural & kids will eventually be exposed to it whether they look in a mirror as their bodies change or find a nudie mag hidden under some older brother's mattress. If your sister herself was stark naked I'd say it's inappropriate but it's just artwork on her back. That being said it is your house & your party, you have the right to ask her to wear something over her tattoo if was too graphic & you'd be embarrassed or if the kids are too immature. If that's the case maybe just don't invite her. I think YTA, maybe everyone sucks here a little bit if she knows her tattoo is graphic & got offended by your request.\n\nWanted to add that I had an uncle (husband of my aunt) who had topless lady tatts on both forearms & I remember noticing them & saying something to my mom after I met him for the first time (I think I was about 8) After that it was nbd & I didn't really think about them or mention it again. Maybe it's because I'm female & don't have a weird taboo about boobs. Also I'm in the US & agree Americans have a weird prudish stigma about nudity ( . ) ( . )", "Not sure about this, could you post some pics so we can see if it's an actual problem", "Your sister sounds awesome, it's sad that you don't live in a country where they teach kids that a naked body isn't something shameful.", "Stop being so soft. The kids won\u2019t even notice.", "Honestly I\u2019d need to see that actual tattoo to make a fair judgement and I understand why you can\u2019t post that but it really depends on the artistic style.", "This is a stretch.", "Yeah cause 6 year olds are reading the placque \ud83e\udd23", "I mean, she probably shouldn\u2019t be wearing a backless dress in a work setting anyway, especially if it\u2019s not the type of place to be cool with the tattoos. But yes, this is an issue.", "This is only acceptable if sister learns how to simultaneously whirl all the tiny tattoo-tassels like Candy down at the Kiss 'n Ride Strip Club..", "I knew Michelangelo since I was 3 years old. He wore orange and uses nunchakus.", "I'm in a country where people don't sexualise nudity to American extremes. So most children see nudity one way or another and I can't imagine anyone complaining over their kid seeing a raunchy tattoo.", "There's a vast difference between sexual and naked.", "NTA, there\u2019s a time and a place for some things and around youngins I personally feel that\u2019s not it. I saw you said she\u2019s having some regrets over it so hopefully she can get everything situated the way she likes soon", "Her work apparently also includes fancy dinners and other social occasions that call for dressing up.", "I agree with you,  but that involves parents taking their own kids to see nudity, forcing someone else's kids to look at nudity without their parents permission is fucked up.", "Me too!\nI'm a big fan of the old Cary Grant movies.", "To that point. I took my son to an art museum when he was four. In the lobby there was a sculpture of a nude man. When my son saw it, he exclaimed, \"you can see his penis!\" Which proceeded to echo throughout the whole god damned cavernous place. The woman at the front desk had a good chuckle. I have the memory that makes me laugh even if I was a little mortified when it happened.\n\n\n\n\nNot that I was mortified at my son, but that I had not prepared him properly.", "Mt brother seriously wanted a skull and bones tattooed across his chest when he was 6.", "NTA.", "As a European, yeah, I do think this type of prudishness makes you an asshole. Your kids don't benefit from being sheltered from nudity. It just ensures their puberty is worse than ours.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what words you used or what tone of voice you told her in, but it\u2019s not an unreasonable request and this is coming from a heavily tattooed woman. You said yourself you love the tattoos but it\u2019s a kids party after all", "So, my son is 5 and we got stuck at an intersection while a naked bike race cruised by our vehicle. We couldn\u2019t go anywhere until the \u201cparade\u201d passed. \nMy son saw at least 1000 naked adults and nothing bad happened. Shaming your sister because of some boobs on her back is ridiculous. We\u2019re there any topless boys swimming in your pool? Topless men/boys are ok but depictions of topless women get you kicked out of the party?", "Agreed. If using different mediums can make it okay then crimes using different methods will be also okay. She just to prideful to admit that she is a A for that. They need to be taught step bye step. Anyways it's not bad if it's just one person but if it's a pool party for kids specially below 10, absolutely her thought process have some issues.", "Can't believe how long I had to scroll to find a YTA! Does this mean she can't swin in public pools or go to the beach??", "Wait till everyone finds out there are nude beaches all over Europe where whole families go and see each other naked, and no children get scarred!!! Or if a child asks a question about it, just explain to them what it is. Guaranteed they are going to continue with their day like nothing happened lol.", "You didn't actually answer the question lol"]}
