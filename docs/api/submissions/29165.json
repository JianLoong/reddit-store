There wasn't anything unusual about the bus, until I started to hear a familiar annoyingly squeaky voice talking at the back of the bus, I looked behind to see it was a girl who had bullied me rentlessly throughout secondary school, sat with a guy who had bullied me during primary school. To make this an easier read, I'll call her Missy and him Bill. \n\nMy headphones had died whilst I was studying, so I couldn't help but eavesdrop on their conversation. I pretty quickly realised that Missy was flirting with Bill and kept suggesting that they 'needed to go out sometime' and that they 'need to make it a date' Bill was clearly not into her, but his friend kept egging Missy on. I started to feel quite bad for Bill, even if he was a little sh*t through school, Missy just wouldn't stop trying and his friend was making it get even worse.\n\nWhilst this was all happening, I was texting a group chat of my friends everything they were saying and desperately trying not to laugh at what I was overhearing. Missy is very disliked by out friendship group \u2014 whilst we were still at school, she slept with one of their boyfriends, called one racist slurs, suggested that one of them had been deported after having a week off to travel to her grandmother's funeral, and outted me as a lesbian to my parents on my own birthday. So they were all finding it as ammusing as I was.\n \nI was trying my hardest to hold back my laughter as the group chat were making jokes and Missy was getting rejected again and again, but not taking the hint. Missy finally broke me when Bill once again said no, and her comeback to being rejected was 'but I have a fat bunda' (for all of those outside of the uk, a fat bunda would be a large bottom) \n\nI burst out laughing, making myself snort as I continued laughing. I turned around to apologise, whilst trying to hold back my laugh, but Missy was glaring at me and Bill looked like he wanted to be anywhere but the bus at that moment. Missy then began screaming at me and stormed off of the top deck, down to the bottom deck for the rest of the bus journey. \n\nI feel bad for laughing at her and making Bill feel even more uncomfortable, but it felt good seeing my old bullies making a fool of themselves, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1697626731, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17anxn1/aita_for_laughing_at_my_old_bully_getting_rejected/", "score": 14, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
