We eneded up working I'm a fast food joint and I was talking about getting my own place and she said that she did to. So I suggested we get one together and she agreed. We found a place pretty close to where we worked because she didn't have a license or car. (I was 19 and she was a few years older than me) I did have a car and a license so if we worked together I'd drive us both there, or if she closed i would pick her up so she wasn't walking alone in the dark. \n\nI got the internet and she put the water and electricity in her name. But she insisted she that she be in charge of making sure the internet was paid. So I gave her the information and she would pay it after I'd give her my half of the bills. \n\nI eventually decided I wanted to get a better paying job so I applied at a factory and got the job. So I told her about it since they were still looking for more employees. So she asked if she were to apply if I'd take her back and forth to work with me. I said that of course I would as long as she chipped in for the gas. (It was about $10 a day 4-6 days a week depending on the overtime) So she eneded up applying and got the job.\n\nThen after a while I started to have issues with her. Anytime something went wrong she would yell and scream at me about it blaming it on me. If a bill was late it was my fault even if I gave her the money before it was due. \n\nIf the apartment was a mess it was my fault. Even if I just cleaned the day before and she invited multiple people over and didn't clean up after them.\n\nThen if she tried to get ahold of me and my phone didn't get the text or call she claimed I just ignored it or blocked her. (My phone was acting up really bad and I never blocked her)She would even barge in my room to yell at me. \n\nIf I bought litter and food for my cat she would use it all for hers and them complain if I didn't buy more. \n\nOver three months of driving her to work and back I recieved $5 in gas from her and that's it. And if I didn't have the money to go out and do anything she would tell me to budget better. (I was spending all my money in gas to take her everywhere) \n\nSo I was talking to my sister one day and she told me I needed to get out asap. So her and my brother moved me out with in two hours. And when I left she tried calling my phone and it didn't go through and she started yelling at me in front of my sister. Then she asked if I would continue to take her to work I told her no and left. \n\nSo WITA for not continuing to take her to work?", "created_utc": 1685500767, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13w9yku/aita_for_moving_out_and_refusing_to_continue/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
