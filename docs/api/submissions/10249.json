Would you be able to live in just his salary?", "She says he barely works hard. In her eyes, he is not putting forth a big effort with work. I don't see how that's different from him barely working. There are people at jobs working from 8-5 but some of these people are only doing \"15 minutes of real actual work.\" She's motivated to succeed which is great, but just because you're a woman doesn't mean you get off the hook with spousal support and I'm saying this as a woman. If you don't want to pay, do what men do. Throw a prenup in their face.", "Weed? Depression? Just lazy by nature?", "Why is this a double standard? I believe she will have to pay. We are not talking about a homemaker. She handled childcare and chores. Dude was a lump for 10 years...", "That's fair, you're right. If we are getting honest info from OP, I am still of the opinion that an able-bodied man should be able to support himself. \n\nWe really need more info. If she's been funding expensive hobbies or habits of his, maybe the Discount Tire manager can sell his sailboat.", "Each case should be examined through a neutral lens. There is no blanket rule for all women or all men. With the individuals involved here, one did almost everything while the other made no effort. What seems right to you?", "I just assumed if he didn\u2019t work he watched the kids.", "Plus the whole \u201cbe a man\u201d is a horrible phrase.", "Every day, I argue in practice for women's equality. I work hard, set good examples for young women, and regularly face challenges in the board room because I'm a woman. I don't give up. \n\nYou can be an armchair feminist and shout about equality while not doing a thing about it and accuse me of arguing against equality. Rich!", "Thank you, yea she is defied being selfish and a bit entitled.", "Maybe substitute the word \u201cadult\u201d for \u201cman\u201d. Then she doesn\u2019t seem so entitled.", "Exactly. OP suuuuuucks. \n\nSounds like \"what's yours is mine and what's mine is mine\"", "Oh thank you surprised I didn\u2019t catch that. But yea that\u2019s being sexist", "Agreed.", "How is it sexist? It is a primal drive of men to protect themselves and their loved ones.", "Alimony is written into the law and awarded when the court finds that it is necessary for the support of the spouse. Just because two people have the idea to prevent alimony it doesn't mean that you can annul state laws. And I think that's especially true when talking about two individuals and not two businesses. Even worse, prenups get diluted about 10% with every year of marriage. So after ten years of marriage it's almost like you never even had a prenup. A prenup is a contract between two people but not a binding contract to the judge and court.", ">Income is not paired to work ethic\n\nVery true I earn 4 times my wife and easy do less than a 1/10 of the work.", "I never asserted that income was always paired to work ethic. \n\nI said in my case, I worked hard to move up and earn more. In his case, he did the minimum and had no desire to progress. \n\nThere's no delusion of meritocracy here. I never made any sweeping statements or assumptions. I merely stated the facts of our case.", ">I get you don\u2019t believe in alimony\n\nI suspect op would have a different opinion if it was the husband with the money", "It is. I should have.", "OP is the one being sexist", "So we ignoring sexists now?", "No, I wouldn't want to live on his salary, but that's why I worked to get where I am. I like vacations. I like a nice car. If I was married to someone earning 4x my salary now, I wouldn't ask for a penny.", "When I think barely work i think as in hours wise.", "Lazy by nature unfortunately. When we first got together I admired his drive. He talked about how much he loved his job, the opportunities, etc. I wonder now if it was all a ruse to impress people.", "Doesn't matter. You keep talking like you know their relationship dynamic. She makes 4 times then him which means he makes money himself\n\nShe has no pay because it's sexist not to. Who cares if he's a man and not as career focused as her. She makes more so she owes spousal support. If the roles were reversed and she made 4 times less, I would say he owes her as well \n\nSo of course it's double standards.", "Yes, I do definitely think we need more information whether her husband helped her with her career and to build herself up to see why he\u2019s asking her for a spousal support so I completely understand that because if he\u2019s just asking for it just because she has money that isn\u2019t right because that is her money.", "I'm not saying your wrong. I'm just asking if the circumstances were identical with just the genders swapped that your opinion would be the same or not?", "She never said he didn't work and she clarified in another comment that he did in fact work but chose to stay in entry level positions. You assumed wrong.", "It\u2019s not sexist because [inserts blatantly sexist rationale here].", "\"Sexism is the prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination based on one's sex or gender.\"\n\nLiterally textbook sexism.\n\nIf you truly feel this way, why do you obviously feel different about a womans place in a relationship/society? Following your thinking, women should stay home, care for the children and home, yet you were the breadwinner of the household.\n\nMen aren't always the strong macho man who bring home all the money, and Women aren't always princesses who watch the children and make dinner.", "Obviously not since your ex husband hasn't according to you (also shouldn't everyone protect their loved ones? You're so weird with the 'primal' stuff)", "It's a primal drive of women to be subservient baby makers.", "You just doubled down \ud83e\udd19\ud83c\udffb you\u2019re an idiot and know nothing about men", "The system is set up to protect those that sacrificed their careers for their spouses.\n\nIt is set up to protect the needy.\n\nIs there a good way to protect the needy while weeding out the lazy?\n\nDoubtful, especially when the person making more has the power of better attorneys.\n\nAs such, in order to protect the needy, society has chosen to protect the lazy as well.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, you chose someone lazy, whether you realized it or not. The laws existed when you got married. If you now view it as a mistake, you are responsible for that mistake. But nothing in life is guaranteed or fair - you took a chance, it failed, and now you bear a non-life-threatening inconvenience. There are worse things in life.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but it is what it is, and the world is probably better off for it being the way that it is.\n\nI\u2019ll leave my feelings about whether making money is the most important thing in life aside\u2026", "Welcome to marriage, and quite frankly I\u2019m a little baffled you have to ask why it is the way it is. You\u2019re NTA for feeling the way you do, but at the end of the day that\u2019s just the way things are. \n\nAlimony/Palimony exists to protect the other party. I\u2019ll use my parents as an example. Mom stopped working when she got pregnant. She wasn\u2019t coerced, it was a mutual decision with my dad. She\u2019s a SAHM who upheld the household and raised the kids. If they got divorced now, what would she do? She\u2019s been out of work for 30 years and gave half her life to her family. Would she deserve alimony? I think so.\n\nTHAT BEING SAID the system is GROSSLY flawed, and routed in old school ways of thinking that used to see a lot more women stay home. Now, most people work and pull their weight, but that still doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re pulling EQUAL weight in a partnership.\n\nI wish people could go to the judge and state their case. Your ex is more than capable of working so what\u2019s the problem, right? Sadly, that\u2019s just not the world we live in. You guys built a life together, and the system is designed to acknowledge that fact. You can certainly try seek legal council, but tbh I think this would be a huge gamble.", "How?", "Well, I hope he can be an adequate co-parent. It sounds like your kids are young enough where that's going to matter for a while. In their interest, it's best if you can come to some kind of detente. Full-blown hostilities will mess them up.", "Yeah, like I already said, she is going to have to pay. Just like a man would. The dynamic is laid out in the rest of the thread. You want to stick up for him because of sexism, but he's a terrible poster boy for your cause.", "lmao right? \"How is it sexist? \\[Says something sexist\\].\"", "For \"wishing he'd be a man\". \nThat's perpetuating gender role stereotypes and minimising a husband/fathers role to just being the atm.", "She\u2019s a woman who\u2019s stepping out and trying to define what a \u201cman\u201d is when she never possessed a pair of balls in her life. A woman can recognize a real man, but not set the standard.", "Because OP did the hard work and raised their children while her ex did nothing. He wasn\u2019t even an atm cause OP made 4x more. If a man wont contribute to raising children the absolute bare minimum/least he can do is contribute financially, which in this case he didnt", "Did you stretch before that reach?", "Says OP. So....take that with  grain of salt. \n\nAnd again you can say ALL that without implying that it is \"manly\" or the man's \"responsibility\" to be the provider. \n\nHusband may well have been a lazy tool but doesn't excuse sexist shitful statements like that.", "Honest question: how is that a reach? Why is it not sexist to say that \u201cbeing a man\u201d equates to earning a certain amount of money? As a woman, I\u2019d definitely find it sexist if someone s said I should \u201cwoman up\u201d and cook for my family or something. Is this not different?", "How is that a reach? How else is \"be a man\" in this context supposed to be taken."]}
