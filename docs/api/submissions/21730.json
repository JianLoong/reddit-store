Because of this it isn't uncommon for me to babysit her over night or even multiple nights when necessary. The kid is 8 and a foster child that my moms friend is trying to adopt. She has a whole complicated situation that involves a lot of trauma but I'm not going to be sharing that in this post. \n\nAnyway, onto the story, last night was one of the instances of her staying the night. She hasn't been over in more then 3 months so she was very excited. It was at my house and like always she wanted to sleep in my room with me. This is no biggie usually, done it before and it's fine. But this night she was especially rowdy and I was catching on that she wasn't sleeping because me being there was too exciting.\n\nI'll admit I was frustrated. It was already 4 in the morning and even though she kept saying she was tired she refused to sleep. So I said I was going to take a quick shower and she said okay and I left. I went to the bathroom (right next to my room so I'd be able to still hear her if she needed something) and turned the water on for 30 minutes. I came back and like I expected she was asleep. \n\nI thought \"problem solved and now it's bed time\" so I went to sleep too.

You merely acted as if you had something else to do, told her to entertain herself, and she fell asleep. \n\nThe key is that you didn\u2019t give her an assignment.

When is babysitter coming back? I\u2019m really not tired now. What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m feeling anxious - oh no, how do I calm myself down? I\u2019m supposed to be asleep!!\u201d \n\nInstead, you removed the pressure and the entertainment by stepping out (both of which will decrease her odds of sleeping), gave her something to look forward to in your return (a wonderful relaxant, as it gives her mind security as well as material for dreams), and let her have the space to doze off. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of similar to falling asleep in front of the TV; sometimes when you\u2019re wound up, it\u2019s easier to doze off by accident than to be instructed that it\u2019s time to go to sleep now. \n\nNTA", "NTA, she wasn't in danger, she didn't cry when you left and she fell asleep.

I will be gone for maybe 10/15 minutes and when I go to check on her she\u2019s usually fallen to sleep. On the off chance she hasn\u2019t, I cuddle with her and she usually goes to sleep quickly after that. \nIt\u2019s too stimulating sometimes for kids to settle while having you there.

(My initial reason as to why not is similar to yours--I have a lot of chronic illnesses including hEDS, lots of major illnesses including clearly partially genetic autism runs in my family. While research is kinda unclear on whether or not autism is genetic, considering just how many people have it on my mother's side of the family, we clearly have some kind of predisposition going on.)\n\nIt's funny because, back when I was in high school, my math teacher took me aside after seeing me with my sister and told me she basically had to raise her siblings and, between that and her job as a teacher, she didn't end up wanting kids.
