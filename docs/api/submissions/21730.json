Because of this it isn't uncommon for me to babysit her over night or even multiple nights when necessary. The kid is 8 and a foster child that my moms friend is trying to adopt. She has a whole complicated situation that involves a lot of trauma but I'm not going to be sharing that in this post. \n\nAnyway, onto the story, last night was one of the instances of her staying the night. She hasn't been over in more then 3 months so she was very excited. It was at my house and like always she wanted to sleep in my room with me. This is no biggie usually, done it before and it's fine. But this night she was especially rowdy and I was catching on that she wasn't sleeping because me being there was too exciting.\n\nI'll admit I was frustrated. It was already 4 in the morning and even though she kept saying she was tired she refused to sleep. So I said I was going to take a quick shower and she said okay and I left. I went to the bathroom (right next to my room so I'd be able to still hear her if she needed something) and turned the water on for 30 minutes. I came back and like I expected she was asleep. \n\nI thought \"problem solved and now it's bed time\" so I went to sleep too. But in the morning when I mentioned it to my brother (22M who lives at home in the room next to mine) in passing he was very upset and shocked that I did that. He said I lied to her and abandoned her and that I can't do that to a kid with trauma like hers.\n\nshe didn't seem upset in the morning and she never called me back to the room. I would've come right back if she had. Plus the door was unlocked if she really needed something. I don't think it's that big of a deal but my brother is insistent that I've betrayed the trust of the kid, my mom, and my moms friend.\n\nHonestly I think he's jealous, he used to be the favorite babysitter and now he isn't. He very much wants to have kids one day and feels like he's an expert with kids. I how ever do not ever want kids. \n\nDon't get me wrong, babysitting this one is great but handling for her a few days is a lot, I would not enjoy having a kid forever. He always comes off as kind of angry and resentful that this child picked me over him. He acts like it's lying to her to say I love her and then not want my own kids one day. I don't see it that way but that isn't the point of this post, that's more to give context as to why I don't think his criticism comes from a genuine place.", "created_utc": 1688885781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14urjcb/aita_for_pretending_to_take_a_shower_when_i_was/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA.", "What?!?", "Is this a bot?", "Yup its a bot", "As someone who used to have pretty severe night terrors as a kid due to unmanaged anxiety, this sounds like a legit great plan. \n\nAnd contrary to popular belief, the reason this would have worked for me when I was a kid is precisely BECAUSE you didn\u2019t tell her to go to sleep. You merely acted as if you had something else to do, told her to entertain herself, and she fell asleep. \n\nThe key is that you didn\u2019t give her an assignment. She didn\u2019t feel the pressure of \u201cI have to fall asleep now. Why am I not tired? Why am I not asleep yet? Where\u2019s babysitter? How long has babysitter been gone? When is babysitter coming back? I\u2019m really not tired now. What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m feeling anxious - oh no, how do I calm myself down? I\u2019m supposed to be asleep!!\u201d \n\nInstead, you removed the pressure and the entertainment by stepping out (both of which will decrease her odds of sleeping), gave her something to look forward to in your return (a wonderful relaxant, as it gives her mind security as well as material for dreams), and let her have the space to doze off. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of similar to falling asleep in front of the TV; sometimes when you\u2019re wound up, it\u2019s easier to doze off by accident than to be instructed that it\u2019s time to go to sleep now. \n\nNTA", "NTA, she wasn't in danger, she didn't cry when you left and she fell asleep.

So I will get her in bed and lay beside her read her a story or talk with her for a little bit, then I\u2019ll say I\u2019m going to get my pjs on or have a shower or something and leave her room. I will be gone for maybe 10/15 minutes and when I go to check on her she\u2019s usually fallen to sleep. On the off chance she hasn\u2019t, I cuddle with her and she usually goes to sleep quickly after that. \nIt\u2019s too stimulating sometimes for kids to settle while having you there. You\u2019re not abandoning her. \n\nAlso, you are right she you mention having kids is a lot. Babysitting is not the same as having a child.

In general I think you should have actually had a shower or had a different excuse; but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s great to tell lies even to children.
