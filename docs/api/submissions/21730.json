She has a whole complicated situation that involves a lot of trauma but I'm not going to be sharing that in this post. \n\nAnyway, onto the story, last night was one of the instances of her staying the night. She hasn't been over in more then 3 months so she was very excited. It was at my house and like always she wanted to sleep in my room with me. This is no biggie usually, done it before and it's fine. But this night she was especially rowdy and I was catching on that she wasn't sleeping because me being there was too exciting.\n\nI'll admit I was frustrated. It was already 4 in the morning and even though she kept saying she was tired she refused to sleep. So I said I was going to take a quick shower and she said okay and I left. I went to the bathroom (right next to my room so I'd be able to still hear her if she needed something) and turned the water on for 30 minutes.

You merely acted as if you had something else to do, told her to entertain herself, and she fell asleep. \n\nThe key is that you didn\u2019t give her an assignment.

When is babysitter coming back? I\u2019m really not tired now. What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m feeling anxious - oh no, how do I calm myself down? I\u2019m supposed to be asleep!!\u201d \n\nInstead, you removed the pressure and the entertainment by stepping out (both of which will decrease her odds of sleeping), gave her something to look forward to in your return (a wonderful relaxant, as it gives her mind security as well as material for dreams), and let her have the space to doze off. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of similar to falling asleep in front of the TV; sometimes when you\u2019re wound up, it\u2019s easier to doze off by accident than to be instructed that it\u2019s time to go to sleep now. \n\nNTA", "NTA, she wasn't in danger, she didn't cry when you left and she fell asleep.

I will be gone for maybe 10/15 minutes and when I go to check on her she\u2019s usually fallen to sleep. On the off chance she hasn\u2019t, I cuddle with her and she usually goes to sleep quickly after that. \nIt\u2019s too stimulating sometimes for kids to settle while having you there.

I\u2019d put my kids to bed and whether they were asleep or not as long as they were settled in bed I took my shower.", "The power ranges called and told me that you absolutely need to finish your vegetables.", "As a babysitter I can get away with things like that without dealing with mom shaming lol", "I'll admit it's a little strange.. he also still lives at home with us. If he wanted to take care of the kid I wouldn't stop him from helping me. But he wants to be the only caretaker it seems like. Now that I type it out, you're right, that's creepy", "I can't say I fully disagree but I suppose I give her some amount of slack? I don't think she's abusive but I understand that she's only doing this because the alternative is sending her back to her fresh out of jail mother which the state somehow thinks will suddenly be able to take care of her. I guess it's like a rock and a hard place. I don't really think my moms 60 year old friend really wants to raise a kid, that isn't the kids fault though. It's all and all a hard situation I think. I'm very sorry you were treated that", "Someone else said I should use a noise app on my phone which I'll do if I get in this situation again", "Your brother needs to know that being so rigid with his 'righteousness' won't help him accomplish much in life down the road.", "You were in the next room and close enough to hear if there was an issue and you got some alone time and she went to sleep!", " At least between the two of you, one is working on their creative problem-solving skills. Thankfully.", "I've 2 kids and sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.", "he biggest issue with the story is the water wastage, but it was only once and that\u2019s not the question you are asking.", "Right? I know OP doesn't want kids, but if it does happen someday, I am pretty sure she'll do a great job as she definitely has the instincts. Little girl is lucky to have a babysitter who loves her so much.", "Where's the water go? Do you think it goes down the drain and....poof! It's gone!?", "The lie she told was probably kinder than saying I\u2019m leaving you alone in here because you won\u2019t go to sleep with me in the room.", "Popsicle bribery is real \n\nOk like- it's fruit ... right??", "I think I'm not translating it correctly: what's a morning pill reward?\n\nThanks in advance for any help.", "[removed]", "Bot? Duplicate comment.", "I know, right? I don't want kids myself, but that doesn't stop me from loving my niece and nephew to death. Eff this dude.", "Genuinely someone who reacted like that would not be allowed to be alone with my child.", "60 years old? She's tired and doesn't have the energy to raise a child that young.\n\nThe systems are so flawed. It's such an awful situation and place to be. \n\nThat's definitely a rough situation.\n\nI had a friend fostering a baby recently and they took him away so fast to have him adopted out by anyone. They system is so bad.", "you can download a noise machine app, they always have water noise options", "I'm a bot or they're a bot?", "I was a nanny for 15 years and what it mostly did was cement my opinion that while I love kids, I couldn't keep up with my own. Then I had to quit because of disabilities, so it worked out perfectly - I got to raise some kids and be close to them, I was told I was like a second mother and ...I now have way less to cope with in my 40s with chronic pain. I won't pass on EDS and autism to someone who might suffer a lot more than me, and be forced to live with the consequences of MY decision.\n\n\nIt's totally normal to love kids but not want your own! Right!??", "I occasionally have to deal with my own child in this way as a parent. You left and took a shower, but you weren't in the shower, so you didn't actually leave her or lie.", "Your solution was a great idea and, most importantly, you", "No trauma is the same and while one person may freak out with that", "Joke?", "Plus you actually set kids up to fail if you do too much. I've had so much therapy and \"self soothing\" is a skill they try to teach ADULTS and this lesson was delivered in a safe, secure way. You can't exactly abandon someone from an en suite bathroom, you'd have to walk back out past them. Bro is indeed being a weirdo.", "Absolutely! And she's separated by a door, can't leave without going back through the bedroom presumably. Absolutely no abandonment.", " I always do come back to check but most of the time they'll be sleeping. If they aren't sleeping they see that I wasn't lying about coming back. Even if I was lying about the reason to leave.", "Bot", "I have long hair so if I'm taking showers it takes a while to wash", "I think 90% of the replies to that comment are bots lmao", "Sadly is, me and my brother don't always get along", "Ya it's awful. She's had to fight and go to so many court dates to keep her this long. She has primary custody though so that's good", "Oh gotcha! That's actually smart", "Not you, this commentor up here\ud83d\udc46", "They're a bot, yes", "I'm a middle school teacher. My students ask a lot about whether or not I want kids. The answer is definitely no. Like you, my answer had been \"no\" before I started teaching, but teaching has cemented that opinion. I love those kids like they're mine, but part of why I can do that is they aren't mine. I get to go home at the end of the day. (My initial reason as to why not is similar to yours--I have a lot of chronic illnesses including hEDS, lots of major illnesses including clearly partially genetic autism runs in my family. While research is kinda unclear on whether or not autism is genetic, considering just how many people have it on my mother's side of the family, we clearly have some kind of predisposition going on.)\n\nIt's funny because, back when I was in high school, my math teacher took me aside after seeing me with my sister and told me she basically had to raise her siblings and, between that and her job as a teacher, she didn't end up wanting kids. So she wanted me to not make her mistakes. Well, I'm nearly 30 now, and I'm making her \"mistakes\" for the same reasons. Called it, I guess, lol.", "I always do come back to check but most of the time they'll be sleeping. If they aren't sleeping they see that I wasn't lying about coming back. Even if I was lying about the reason to leave.", "Absolutely. Some people are destined to be s cool aunt or uncle.", "[deleted]", "I'm glad there is a safe place for her to stay for the time being and give her some regular schedule and security. \n\nJust don't be afraid to say no sometimes...if it's best for you.", "I think they just aren't scientifically advanced enough to understand how it's expressed in genes, because it sure does seem like there is an hEDS/Autism combo happening a lot! It was Ancestry DNA that confirmed my EDS, I was diagnosed in 2016 but when the new criteria came out, I don't have any immediate family member with it - my dead dad was adopted, and when I got matched with bio relatives, yup, together in my relatives too!", "Yup, exactly. And that's a perfectly good call to make at 4am!", "O.... kaayyyy"]}
