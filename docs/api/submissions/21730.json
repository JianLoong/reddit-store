Because of this it isn't uncommon for me to babysit her over night or even multiple nights when necessary. The kid is 8 and a foster child that my moms friend is trying to adopt. She has a whole complicated situation that involves a lot of trauma but I'm not going to be sharing that in this post. \n\nAnyway, onto the story, last night was one of the instances of her staying the night. She hasn't been over in more then 3 months so she was very excited. It was at my house and like always she wanted to sleep in my room with me. This is no biggie usually, done it before and it's fine. But this night she was especially rowdy and I was catching on that she wasn't sleeping because me being there was too exciting.\n\nI'll admit I was frustrated. It was already 4 in the morning and even though she kept saying she was tired she refused to sleep. So I said I was going to take a quick shower and she said okay and I left. I went to the bathroom (right next to my room so I'd be able to still hear her if she needed something) and turned the water on for 30 minutes. I came back and like I expected she was asleep. \n\nI thought \"problem solved and now it's bed time\" so I went to sleep too. But in the morning when I mentioned it to my brother (22M who lives at home in the room next to mine) in passing he was very upset and shocked that I did that.

I would've come right back if she had. Plus the door was unlocked if she really needed something. I don't think it's that big of a deal but my brother is insistent that I've betrayed the trust of the kid, my mom, and my moms friend.\n\nHonestly I think he's jealous, he used to be the favorite babysitter and now he isn't.

You merely acted as if you had something else to do, told her to entertain herself, and she fell asleep. \n\nThe key is that you didn\u2019t give her an assignment.

When is babysitter coming back? I\u2019m really not tired now. What\u2019s going on? I\u2019m feeling anxious - oh no, how do I calm myself down? I\u2019m supposed to be asleep!!\u201d \n\nInstead, you removed the pressure and the entertainment by stepping out (both of which will decrease her odds of sleeping), gave her something to look forward to in your return (a wonderful relaxant, as it gives her mind security as well as material for dreams), and let her have the space to doze off. \n\nIt\u2019s kind of similar to falling asleep in front of the TV; sometimes when you\u2019re wound up, it\u2019s easier to doze off by accident than to be instructed that it\u2019s time to go to sleep now. \n\nNTA", "NTA, she wasn't in danger, she didn't cry when you left and she fell asleep.

I will be gone for maybe 10/15 minutes and when I go to check on her she\u2019s usually fallen to sleep. On the off chance she hasn\u2019t, I cuddle with her and she usually goes to sleep quickly after that. \nIt\u2019s too stimulating sometimes for kids to settle while having you there.

It isn't like I use a lot, it just takes a while to get it through to all of my hair to the scalp at all lol", "I just tell people I'm allergic to children and I never have to deal with them.", "NTA.  That\u2019s a great way to handle it.  You know what the problem was and helped her calm down so she could sleep.  I sure hope you\u2019re getting paid for this babysitting.", "NTA\n\nEveryone has basic needs like sleeping, showering, going to the bathroom, eating, drinking water, etc. It's normal to have to leave kids alone for a bit--plus you weren't even actually showering, you were just letting the water run while still staying vigilant to hear any possible noise coming from your room.", "NTA. Next time, I\u2019d give her melatonin because 4 am is insane \ud83d\ude05", "That's honestly a brilliant idea, I'm a mom and it sounds fine. Especially at 4am, man I say should tried it earlier lol", "Soft YTA. No harm, no foul. But your brother is right, if she\u2019s a traumatized child you need to be extremely careful about betraying her trust, lying to her, tricking her. You could significantly set her back if you\u2019ve earned her trust and you\u2019re tricking her over something so simple.\n\n99% of the time, 99% of kids, you did nothing wrong. But going off the context of this specific kid, I think you need to be REALLY careful about trust with her.\n\nObviously we can\u2019t know because you didn\u2019t specify the trauma. But her background matters here, just consider it next time. If she needs someone to trust, don\u2019t let her think you were hiding from her or something like that. Kids think differently, especially abused ones.", "NTA, I tell my kid I need to poop or shower all the time to get him to calm down at bedtime, or else I get trapped for hours.. if I'm there, he gets excited and associates me w play. Telling him I have to poop tells him I also have needs and he also needs to learn to self sooth. \n\nI applaud you for staying up till 4am w her! I'd would have done what you did hours ago.", "It was 4 am she needed to get to bed already. She wasn\u2019t put in physical danger or forced to take anything to knock her out. NTA", "nta.  your brother should mind his biz.  perfect.idea to get her.settled and sleeping.  people shower!  it is a normal thing. it isnt like you promised to pick her up for a fun say and never show.  you left her in a situation that was safe too.  good work.", "My grandma (I called her Mom) took me in as an infant when she was 60.  I can\u2019t imagine how she did it.  I\u2019m pushing 60 and my grandkids wear me out in a few hours.  Good luck to her.  It\u2019s awesome that she is trying to help this kid.  And good luck to you!!   You\u2019re doing great!!", "NTA. You can go in the bathroom while the kid settles down to sleep at 4am.", "u/Flapter5289 is a bot.", "u/Familash7720 is a bot.", "The bot stole this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14urjcb/comment/jr9joia/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from u/han-t", "the bot stole this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14urjcb/comment/jr9kq1z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from u/jmilan3", "NTA but next time you should think of a better way than wasting water for 30 whole minutes, especially in our current context of droughts.", "NTA. Anyone can backseat a care situation. You made a really solid choice for 4am. Kudos to you.", "You did great OP! \n\nPending what state she\u2019s in, she might not legally be allowed to babysit. In my state only state certified people can watch foster children.", "NTA. my kid will talk to me until he loses his voice if i stay around him during bed time. sometimes i just have to give kisses and hugs and good nights and then walk out. i feel bad but i know that kid needs rest lol\n\ni understand what your brother is saying, sort of. but you didn't leave the kid completely alone. you were in the shower. chances are they fell asleep about 10 minutes in. \n\nalso, you not wanting your own children plays no part in how you treat children. that's an unnecessary stab at you as a person.", "NTA\n\nI was a kid with trauma as well, abuse, neglect and abandonment. It\u2019s not traumatizing to have your caregiver take a shower.", "OP\u2026as a CT Survivor, it makes sense that she would Bond with you. Also, you didn\u2019t necessarily \u201cLie\u201d to her. You WERE in your bathroom (as you state-right Next to Your Room)..you DID Turn ON the Water & Allowed you BOTH,  to CALM yourselves so that you could both Finally sleep. You handled it PERFECTLY & I\u2019m positive that Her Mom & Yours would agree!! 1,000% NTA & WELL DONE! \n\nOh & it\u2019s also perfectly Fine & NORMAL to Live Kids & still NOT Want to Carry or Give Birth & Raise them. I LOVE all 4 of my now grown kids, however..there Were days when it was HARD to Lime them. They had & have very Strong opinions. Lol", "I promise I have made up crazier stories to get my own kids to go to sleep. Raising kids is a whole lot more of convincing a tired person to go to sleep than I ever expected. I once had to rock my 2 year old\u2019s baby doll to sleep and let her \u201csleep in my bed\u201d in order for her to lay down. NTA. Parents do these things a lot ourselves.", "Brother is a Self-Centered, Sanctimonious, Blowhard."]}
