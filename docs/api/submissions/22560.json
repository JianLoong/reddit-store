They\u2019re being selfish and greedy.", "Follow your grandparents' wishes & not your family's. It's not their money/will & therefore they get zero say. It's disrespectful to be trying to change the will for their greed. They're circling like vultures & your Nan's still alive, making it worse. You're NTA & don't agree to anything. Tell the lawyer that you're not agreeing & keep an eye on your Nan so someone can't trick her into signing something to make the changes against her wishes.

It\u2019s their call. \n\nI\u2019m a medical student and we recently had an elderly man and his daughter come in to get a certificate showing he still had capacity. saying he\u2019s allowed to change this will. It was the strangest thing, because he wanted to leave everything to her. Whereas she wanted him to leave everything to her kids. Either way, once alone with him we explained that it\u2019s his estate, and his prerogative to do what he wishes. If he doesn\u2019t want to split it between her and his other daughters, or all his grandkids, he didn\u2019t have to. It was on her to make that split later on if she wanted. Seems like she wanted him to do that so that it wasn\u2019t on her to give something else to her siblings children - and honestly the man didn\u2019t either, but will definitely put her in a sticky situation in the future. Just a story I thought I\u2019d share. \n\nIt\u2019s no ones call but the person who\u2019s estate it is, your dad and aunts have no place deciding whats fair or not.", "NTA. It's not their money and they have no right to dictate who gets it - make sure to remind them of that at every opportunity. I'd even raise it with the grandparent, that they're pressuring you. See how they like being taken out of the will.", "NTA but you can't change the will so I don't understand how that would work. If the remaining grandparent who can't speak is still of sound mind then they can make changes to the will if they want to, but once they pass there is nothing your family can do about it. If you feel like your grandparent is not of sound mind then you should find out who is the executor of the will and make sure that they don't coerce your grandparent into signing something they don't understand or want to sign.", "Do not change it! Your grandparents wanted the you in the will! Take what was left to you, your other family members are just users with no respect for your grandparents! All they want is their money and possessions. Do not agree to be taken out of the will, definitely Not The ass", "NTA.  Of course they didn't ask to change it when your grandparents were capable - they wouldn't have liked the answer!  Fair?  They think it's fair for them to take the money your grandparents want YOU to have.  They are being greedy, entitled AHs.  Tell them no.", "I'd go further. OP would dishonor grandparents by not following what they wanted."]}
