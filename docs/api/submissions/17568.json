I lost my job so I stayed at his place and watch his cat and got his packages. It was great! I got to live completely alone and I didn\u2019t have to wear pants every day. And most importantly, I did something to help him because I love him and his cat and it would give him piece of mind that someone that loves her is being with her. It\u2019s not a boundary, you are not committed. I don\u2019t particularly love scooping cat poop and pre but I did it. That\u2019s just what you do. I think you need to evaluate whether or not you want to be in a relationship because from time to time you maybe inconveniences that\u2019s just part of life. You\u2019d want her to help you out.", "IMO it\u2019s a bit dramatic to call this a boundary. It\u2019s just saying no to a one time request. Unless this is a universal rule you apply to others in your life and have communicated with her about, it\u2019s not much of a boundary. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask a second time, especially if she tried to find another person she knows and trusts after asking the first time but was unsuccessful.

Why don\u2019t you just stay at her place and take care of the dogs while she\u2019s away. 1. Someone is occupying the house and it will deter burglaries ( summer has higher B&Es) 2. You aren\u2019t working or in school, so really what do you have to lose. 3. It\u2019s almost like a staycation for you. Just get her to stick the cabinets and fridge.

This is all sorts of destined for disaster. \n\n20 mins away x 2 (there and back) x 2 times per day is 80 minutes of driving time alone.

If not, don't do it. If you are, should probably do it and show your girlfriend that you care about her and she can rely on you.

Either your girlfriend is worth going out of your way for or she is not.  You don't have to do this, but she doesn't need to be your girlfriend either.
