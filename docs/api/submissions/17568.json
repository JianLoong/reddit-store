Of course you do. Does it make you an asshole? Yup. \n\nYTA. You have shown your girlfriend how little you care about her.", "YTA. Just go ahead and break up with her already, because it's obvious you'll never be there for her, since you refuse to help her out now even though you have, literally, absolutely nothing else to do.", "YTA, except I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really \u201casshole\u201d.  You are not worth bothering with.  Were I your girlfriend, I would figure that you had shown me the worth of our relationship (very low), OR you really hate dogs.

If you value your relationship this little, you shouldn\u2019t be with that person.", "YTA, you guys have been together for a year, and you're unwilling to watch her dogs?!  Do you even like your girlfriend?", "So basically you're telling your partner that you're simply too lazy to be bothered with the responsibility of helping her out.

I lost my job so I stayed at his place and watch his cat and got his packages. It was great! I got to live completely alone and I didn\u2019t have to wear pants every day. And most importantly, I did something to help him because I love him and his cat and it would give him piece of mind that someone that loves her is being with her. It\u2019s not a boundary, you are not committed. I don\u2019t particularly love scooping cat poop and pre but I did it. That\u2019s just what you do. I think you need to evaluate whether or not you want to be in a relationship because from time to time you maybe inconveniences that\u2019s just part of life. You\u2019d want her to help you out.", "IMO it\u2019s a bit dramatic to call this a boundary. It\u2019s just saying no to a one time request. Unless this is a universal rule you apply to others in your life and have communicated with her about, it\u2019s not much of a boundary. It\u2019s not unreasonable to ask a second time, especially if she tried to find another person she knows and trusts after asking the first time but was unsuccessful. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole, but if I had to admit to a friend that I needed them to pet sit because my boyfriend refused despite being completely available I would be so embarrassed", "YTA.\n\nRefusing to do a favour for your partner isn't a 'boundary', it's just being unhelpful.

He doesn't need a reason to say no to something. He's got that right, she's also got the right to break up with him.\nShe could also put them in a kennel while she's away which is really the best thing to do here.\nPersonally I think there's more to it all but based on just this one thing I'm gonna say NTA.\nPeople have different boundaries and if we're not happy with someone's boundaries then time to move along.", "You have every right to set a boundary.\n\nBut it also sounds like you don't care about the dogs much.

Why don\u2019t you just stay at her place and take care of the dogs while she\u2019s away. 1. Someone is occupying the house and it will deter burglaries ( summer has higher B&Es) 2. You aren\u2019t working or in school, so really what do you have to lose. 3. It\u2019s almost like a staycation for you. Just get her to stick the cabinets and fridge.

As others have stated, OP is 20 & gf is asking for OP to commit to responsibilities that OP never signed up for. \n\nNTA, but also break up, please. This is all sorts of destined for disaster. \n\n20 mins away x 2 (there and back) x 2 times per day is 80 minutes of driving time alone.

Definitely inconvenient so I get where OP is coming from, but your only excuse is that you don't want to.

If not, don't do it. If you are, should probably do it and show your girlfriend that you care about her and she can rely on you.

Either your girlfriend is worth going out of your way for or she is not.  You don't have to do this, but she doesn't need to be your girlfriend either.

No, but you should if you want to be a good partner who cares about her happiness. Do you have to get your mother flowers for mother day? No, but you should if you want your mother to feel loved and appreciated. Do you have to socialize with people at work? No, but you should if you want access to the network of favors, trades, and support that basic human manners gives you.\n\nHuman society is a complex web of interconnected favors, acts of service, and internal responsibility that you develop with every kind act you do. If you watch your girlfriends dog, she'll feel appreciated and will SHOW that appreciation in some way down the road, whether in affection, return favors, or a deepening sense of trust in the relationship. This is not a reduction of human relationships. This is not making it transactional. This is the fundamental truth of the human psyche that if you are not nice, people are not going to be nice to you. If you do not give, then you do not deserve to receive. If you're not willing to act like a boyfriend, then why should you have a girlfriend? Why should she bother with you? What is the *purpose* of your connection to her if not a mutually supportive relationship upon which she can rely at need? \n\nSociety is growing more and more selfish and it's attitudes like this that really seem to underlay all of it. Bosses who don't feel a sense of duty to their employees, boyfriends who don't think they have to put in the same effort as their girlfriends, neighbors who want to build walls and shut out anyone who slightly annoys them.

You are showing her that:\n- she isn\u2019t important to you, \n- her needs are not important to you, \n- you sitting around unemployed at your own home is more important to you than her being able to go away on her holiday and have some peace of mind knowing her dogs are taken care of, when you can do the same thing at her house. \nBasically you\u2019re showing her you don\u2019t care that much about her. \n\nNow there may be more to the story that you haven\u2019t told us.

Ask her to fill the cupboards with your favourite foods, give her a list. Ensure all your creature comforts are there for you, so it\u2019s like your own a little mini vacation except with the dogs. Hang out there, doing what you\u2019d be doing at home, and take care of the dogs while you\u2019re at it; or \n\n2. Be honest with your girlfriend and tell her that while you might like her you\u2019re just not willing to put yourself out for her. Even a mild inconvenience like she\u2019s asking of you is too much, so you are going to break up. She can the move on to find somebody who is going to meet her needs, care for her enough to be slightly inconvenienced when necessary, and she will get to be with someone she can do those same things to in return. You can then stay home and do whatever it is you\u2019re doing without having to exercise compassion, kindness, generosity or service to anyone. \n\nWhichever way you go, you really need to take a long hard look at yourself and decide if this is the person you really wanna be.

It took a long time to build the relationships with the sitters, but that\u2019s how it is being pet parents. I wouldn\u2019t trust OP with petsitting since OP refused the first time. That\u2019s a big red flag for petsitting. I can\u2019t believe gf would ask a second time. \n\n\nI think the gf is choosing her convenience over her fur baby. I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t have sitters lined up, and I can\u2019t believe she didn\u2019t make arrangements once her vacation is planned. Im going on a vacation end of June, and I scheduled my sitter visits beginning of May. And our relative has our keys just in case both sitters have emergency at the time of the scheduled visits. \n\n\nJust because you are a pet parent doesn\u2019t mean everyone should compromise their lives for your fur baby. Your fur baby is your responsibility, you need to plan your trip and make plans for your baby at the same time. Asking boyfriend is literally the last resort I can think of. \n\n\nBut yeah, definitely break up. Different life choices and all that stuff\u2026", "80 minutes of driving a day plus the time it takes to walk them long enough so that they can go do their biz, plus feeding, watering, cleaning up accidents.  You\u2019re talking 2-3 hours of work a day for a week.  Not a small ask.", "Exactly, why aren't the dogs in a doggy hotel or whatnot for the duration of her trip. Everyone saying he's not going to have a girlfriend when she gets home from her vacation may be correct, but it may be by mutual choice after this debacle. I wouldn't stick around someone who doesn't listen when I said I wouldn't do something, and simply continues to insist that I will do the thing, because she said so. He dodged the bullet in this scenario.", "Ummm you can\u2019t just leave dogs for 19-20 hours in a stretch like you\u2019re proposing, this is seriously inhumane.", "No no, see, he just has to *EXPLAIN* what the boundary is and I'm sure she'll get a much better idea of how he feels. \n\n\"Babe, you crossed a line about my fundamental values. Trying to reason with me about the specifics doesn't change anything. You need to understand that even when I have literally nothing else to do all week, you are **STILL** not worth my time.  I won't do you any favors even if you paid me.\"\n\nI guarantee that will help clear a few things up for her.", "Just look after her dogs. If the drive is too inconvenient then keep the dogs at your place, or ask if you can stay at her place for the week. If you had just said yes the first time I'm sure she'd show how grateful she is to you in a lot of ways. Relationships are about selflessly giving to the other person. Probably too late to say yes now though. The damage is probably done to the relationship.", "Makes me wonder if he's just as unwilling to drive a whopping *20 minutes* to see her, too. /u/Disastrous-Lock442 do you make her do all the driving normally or are you just randomly drawing this \"boundary\" now when there's nothing in it for you?", "Literally this", "What\u2019s YTSB mean here? Haven\u2019t seen that one yet", "This!! Whenever I go to my parents house, dog sitting is my way of paying for the lodge. And I walk the dogs 4 times a day plus playing fetch & rough housing & belly rubbing & feeding & grooming, etc. that\u2019s why I have cats cuz they are much lower maintenance, yet I still have a bunch of sitters numbers to take care of my cats when I\u2019m out on vacations. Also when I\u2019m on vacation, my husband is too, so I can\u2019t ask him to pet sit for me right? Relationship going serious still can\u2019t make my then bf to care for the cats for me LOL", "Agree. Surprised so many people here would be ok with their partner saying \"I'm going away on vacation for a week. Without you... Do what I demand of you or I'm going to be mad. Cool?\"\n\n  Yes he is not handling it great but at 19 or 20... That's normal?", "Because dogs are over glorified as a must have to get.  Yet people seldom understand what responsibility getting these animals takes, and the sacrifices that are needed.   At 19, peoples lives are dynamic, they wanna go away a lot, they're gonna be staying out more.  A dog is nothing more than a burden to that. But they don't see it because DoGs ArE AmAzInG!!!!", "This is my new favorite saying. Thank you so much for introducing me to it!", "This \u261d\ufe0f", "I'm guessing it's \"You're The Shitty Boyfriend.\"", "If she\u2019s desperate and worried, I honestly don\u2019t understand why, if she\u2019s already willing to pay, why she don\u2019t pay an actual dog walker. I\u2019d never ask someone who didn\u2019t see happy or excited to pet sit. Who\u2019s to say he\u2019d even do it properly when he said no the first time.", "Yeah many people would travel longer than 20min to help their friends. Honestly, such an AH leaving his gf in a poopy situation. Seriously small effort to drive 20min while not occupied and he could do the job search also from her place. Its also super flexible in case there are any interviews. She could probably hire or ask someone else but a) she thinks he is just messing with her and b) its difficult to find a trustworthy-reliable person, explain them everything about the dogs and the household. Meanwhile he knows everything about the household and the dogs are used to him. So logically its the best option to ask him but maybe he is just too immature to understand how relationships work.", "I have a friend who asked me to check on his cat. I went 40 minutes by taxi everyday because the kitty is cute and my friend needed help. When I went on work trips, my SO (back at the time we didn't move in yet) spent a week at my place so my cat wasn't sad and lonely. \n\nIt's just so weird the guy couldn't bother spending an hour to help his girl. It's kinda... Shallow.", "Can you imagine if they had a kid and she asked for him to stay with the baby while she went on an errand and he was like, eh, I know i *can* and i know i *should*, but...eh, she's not respecting my bOuNdArIeS.", "Incredible. You love your friend more than this guy loves his girlfriend.", "LMAO why did I think it was your the shit bag", "She may have said twice a day as bare min if she senses on a base level how much of an inconvenience he makes her feel.", "As a therapist, I have to tell you that we are soooo annoyed by this trend. It\u2019s not often a client admits to using therapy speak inappropriately, but when I catch one of my clients having done it, I ALWAYS take it as an opportunity to provide more clarification on the matter. Trust me, we are just as annoyed by it as everyone else is.", "I had a friend who used to pet sit for me, and they lived far away so this is what they would do. I would just make sure there were clean sheets on the bed and maybe some of their beverages of choice in the fridge and they were all set.", "Or better yet, have the dogs come stay with him for a week", "There is no way in the world she should pay him for this. It's just the kind of thing people in a relationship do for each other. But a gesture if appreciation like a dinner or whatever would be nice. But even that shouldn't be expected", "Because mommy won't be at his GFs place to cook for him and do his laundry, obviously.", "Because he doesn't really love or care for her.", "I'm thinking he did that just to prove that it was him. That way you knew it actually was him and not your new dude making shit up", "Stop triggering peoples\u2019 trauma about gatekeeping and gaslighting. /s", "Can I just say Kudos to your manager?", "Because relationships used to be all about keeping a man happy, and catered for them but now we see a lot of more women being advised to advocate for their feelings and wants, men didn't have to keep a woman's needs in mind since they were the ones with the freedom of just getting up and leave."]}
