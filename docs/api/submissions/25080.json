I talked about how I felt like their dynamic was unhealthy and that the girlfriend was manipulative.

Do your solo traveling, the rest will work itself out", "NTA- 23 year old twin here, I relate so much to your post. Twins have a bond that is very close and many significant others of twins get jealous of this. My last bf tried to bring me and my twin apart as much as he could because he was insecure. He constantly put me in situations where I had to chose her or him. In the end she won lol. She has a bf that I like a lot. He always makes sure I\u2019m included in things with them especially because I am single. And we still spend a lot of alone time together. I think the relationship with your twin and gf does seem toxic and codependent. Im even tempted to think the gf is jelous of your guys relationship and trying to drive a wedge between you two. Also I\u2019ve been in the spot your sister is in and it is also super hard. She may seem like she doesn\u2019t care about you or your feeling but she does. I\u2019m sorry your in this situation I bet it is super hard for you.", "You haven't given us enough information about your sister and her GF's relationship to know whether you are right about her discarding you and being manipulated. It is very possible that after 18 years of being each other's first person, you and your twin are starting to drift apart which would hurt. It's normal, it's natural but it would be uncomfortable for both of you.\n\nNTA for wanting to take your gap year on your own. Become your own person then when you get back, you and your twin can get to know each other again as adults with different life experiences.", "Wow, couples therapy at 18. Phew boy I can't imagine that.\n\n>I talked to her about how I was resentful of how often she disregards me in favor of her girlfriend.\n\nINFO why specifically does this make you resentful? Is it because you're twins? Because I feel like it's pretty common for teenagers to put their SOs above a sibling. Even *more* common for adults.", "NTA make your own plans", "NTA. Your sisters gf is hurt because she probably knows there's some truth in what you're saying. I think you've been really mature in telling your sister your concerns and compassionate by saying that you're willing to discuss what you meant and offer an apology for any feelings hurt.\n\nYou're sister need to find her backbone hopefully therapy will help this. \n\nIn the meantime you'd be justified in making plans to travel alone and enjoying seeing the world.
