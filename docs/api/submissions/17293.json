She's getting invites ready now and after repeatedly having trouble with my SIL Meg I asked her to take her name off the invite list and not send one. My husband is in full support of this but Meg, my MIL and my other SIL Jess. FIL is on my side, as is BIL Rory and SIL Elle.\n\nThe issue is my daughter's middle name and some very hurtful comments Meg made. My maternal family have a tradition that started several generations ago where we give the first girl the middle name Moon. It was a tradition started by an ancestor of mine who believed in nature healing and the story goes she prayed to the moon when she was pregnant with her child believing she was miscarrying and that she believed the moon saved her child and when her daughter was born she gave her the middle name Moon as a tribute and for a few generations after they continued to do this with their first girls as a tribute, but then later it just became this nice, if a little unusual (because of the name) tradition. And the fact it survived a more patriarchal society and was continued even when men usually cared little for their wives family traditions made it special. I'm the first daughter in my family and it's my middle name. My husband was always in love with the idea of continuing and he also thinks it's great that the middle name is more out there/unusual in terms of names.\n\nEarly in my pregnancy Meg made a comment that she hoped we weren't going to give our daughter that \"silly name\" and my husband was like we are, yeah. Meg rolled her eyes and said it's time to end it. My husband told her it was none of her business. Meg asked me a couple of weeks after that what our first name choices were and whether we were trying to make a name sound good with Moon. I told her that my husband and I were not discussing names outside of each other. She told me we'd need help if we're going to do that to our child, meaning give her Moon as a middle name. My husband picked up a mobile of stars for our baby's room and Meg commented that I was weird enough to suggest naming our baby Star. My husband made her leave. Then about two weeks ago she sent me an this word document that was supposed to be an article on middle names being weird could be just as harmful as when first names are weird. And in her message she said that my parents were shitty but it didn't mean I should follow in their footsteps. I told my husband and he told her to go fuck herself already and leave us alone.\n\nSo with all of this, I don't want her there. But Meg is pissed and this has caused a divide among my ILs. Meg said I was selfish and that I was only thinking of myself and not my daughter. First I give her a weird name, then I come between her and her brother and now I am dividing the whole family and leaving her out of a family celebration for her baby niece.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684149916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i5g0r/aita_for_asking_my_best_friend_not_to_invite_my/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could have been bullied and such because of it, but nothing happened because he never shared it with anyone at school.

THAT is the core of the conflict here; your SIL is so concerned about a name being harmful she decided to be the first person to instigate that harm.", "NTA, but you could definitely have fun with this. Go find all the names that your SIL would object to (Hepzibah, Troglodyta, Placenta) and tell her you are thinking of those for middle names instead of Moon. And then, of course, keep Moon as the middle name because you and your husband have agreed to name your baby. (I did this with my sister except I was looking at boy names like Paphnutius and Galacteon. She backed off on the \"weird\" name of Peter.)", "NTA. Meg is going out of her way to be rude to you. She doesn't deserve an invite. Simple as that.", "NTA. This shower is for you, and anyone who would make you feel uncomfortable should obviously not be invited. If by some miracle she realized she was behaving badly and apologized, she could always be given a last minute verbal invitation.", "NTA. She's been absurd and incredibly rude, so leave her out of the party.", "NTA, and you *know* Meg's gonna name her future kid something with unnecessary Y's in it. I'm not endorsing free rein in kids' names, but some people really want to bury the fact that you could name your kid John Doe or Bob Smith and kids will find mean names based on it. If anything, Moon is a badass middle name, and the other kids are gonna WISH their middle name was something awesome like that.", "NTA, but do you think this might be rooted in racism somehow? If so I wouldn\u2019t let Meg around your child at all", "NTA, when I was reading the part about what Meg said about the name and tradition, I had Peter Griffin in my head going \"shut up, Meg!\"\n\nMoon is a lovely name, and I wish you, your husband, and your baby girl the best", "NTA. She divided the family by continuing to speak out on this despite being told her views were not welcome.", "NTA. It's a party for you and for your baby, and nobody has a \"right\" to be there. Strike her from the invitation list, and don't let her crash the party, either. (And while it's totally irrelevant, I think your family tradition is utterly cool.)", "\"My husband made her leave. \" \" he told her to go fuck herself already and leave us alone.\"\n\nUm, I don't think OP is the one dividing the family. Meg is by being such an AH. \n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nI love the name Moon!", "NTA. Your shower, your choice on the invite list. Especially given the hurtful comments. You're not being selfish in any way.", "NTA\n\nWow -  I could almost excuse her saying Moon was weird (she's allowed to have an opinion) but calling your parents shitty, then refusing the drop it and also dragging your ILs into it?  Yeah, you need to go LC/NC with Meg.\n\nAnd for that matter, why would you want to have your child exposed to shitty parents like the people who raised Meg?  Your middle name maybe unusual but Meg's parents did a piss poor job with her despite her \"normal\" names.", "Meg is disrespecting a family tradition. She voiced her opinion and she won't let it go. SHE is the one who is dividing the family with her unhelpful, unkind attitude. I suggest you tell those family members that you only want the people who will support and uplift your child at the shower, not people who will call your little one's name \"stupid\" and to be ashamed of her name, her heritage, and family traditions. NTA.", "As long as you're not gonna name your kid luna moon your NTA. Meg is the Ahole.", "\u201cShut up, Meg\u201d -Peter Griffin", "NTA. Meg needs to keep her opinions to herself. You haven\u2019t created the drama and divide in the family she has and she\u2019s trying to bully you into doing something that she wants for YOUR child. I wouldn\u2019t invite her either and if she carries on creating problems, I\u2019d probably just tell her to take a long walk off a short pier.", "NTA\n\nMy parents were French Canadian Catholic and had the tradition that all the girls had to have Marie or Mary as the middle name, and all the boys had Joseph. This was done on both sides, my mother's and my father's. (Yes, apparently this is a cultural thing.)\n\nYour family's naming tradition is meaningful and just as valid as any other tradition. Meg needs to get over herself.  You and your husband are the only ones who have a say in what our daughter is named. Next time she starts on the middle name, remind Meg that the only business she has is her own.", "NTA.  I think she's behaved badly enough to not get an invite.  What, she wants to be close to a child whose middle name she finds inappropriate?  Do you believe that she will keep her mouth shut around your daughter?  If she does come and she mentions baby names, you should tell her that her opinion is irrelevant, and that you will not discuss names with her ever.", "Personally I find the name Moon weird, but this isn't about anyone else's opinion than yours and your husband's. They are the only two opinions that matter. NTA good luck with the kid, also when I see the name Meg, I am thinking Meg from family guy.", "NTA most people don\u2019t know each others middle names lol your SIL is a brat. Congrats!", "NTA.  Meg however is a huge AH.  It\u2019s a middle name, and it\u2019s lovely.  Tell her to take a long walk on a short pier.  It\u2019s absolutely none of her business.  If she\u2019s not going to be a nice loving Auntie then she shouldn\u2019t  get to be one at all.", "I would have thought that the popularity of family guy would have put Meg off being rude to people. NTA and \"Shut up Meg\" \ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06\ud83d\ude06", "NTA.", "My family has a similar tradition of the eldest daughters having the same middle name; my name's much more \"normal\" but I love and treasure it nonetheless. It connects me to my family and if I have children I absolutely intend to continue the tradition. The story behind Moon is so special and IDK what Meg's on about, plenty of names would sound lovely with it! Absolutely NTA, and congrats on the new little! Best wishes for good health and an easy birth", "Someone needs to tell Meg to go nut one off and relax a little. \nHopefully Nut Meg will be a little sweeter than no nut Meg.", "This. First born sons in my family have the same middle name. It's a word from our ancestral language which means first-born son.   \n\n\nIt's unusual, absolutely. And I know the two current youngest bearers of it (both young adults now) love having that tie to their heritage, history and family.", "Also, her and a lot of other women in her family had that middle name and it doesn't seem to have ruined their lives or embarrassed them, especially given that the tradition as endured. If it was a bad as she's saying it is, there'd be a lot more women in her family that resented it. She's not only disrespecting OP's parental right to choose the name of the child, she's disrespecting her whole family and their tradition and literally called her parents \"shitty\" which also implies every other parent in her family that gave their daughter that middle name was also shitty. The only person that fits that description is the SIL harassing them. OP, NTA, and you have every right to keep your daughter away from her because it seems like she won't let this drop and would constantly tell your young daughter as she grows up that her name is awful and how her parents failed her in giving her that name. Of course you'd keep someone that negative and toxic away from your baby before she gets in her head and affects her self-esteem.", "Agreed. I wouldn\u2019t use it as a first name but it\u2019s very pretty for a middle name and not even that unusual (Sheri Moon Zombie anyone?). Meg is 100% the bully and the one projecting.", "Moon really isn\u2019t that odd.", "Yes please do this!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 hilarious. I love it.", "This is the way.", "she's already the TA, there is no upside to giving her an opportunity to continue to be a TA and ruin for OP what should be a joyous, positive, affirming celebration supporting her and her growing family", "Astrid Moon is wonderful!!", "My kid's name is Winter that would go well with moon too", "Diana Moon ?", "People are sleeping on this comment, I almost died choking on laughter.", "People are using WAY stranger names these days.", "Bad bot.", "Winter Moon would be a seriously bad ass name", "Let's not forget that she also insulted OP's parents. Methinks that e-mail should be forwarded to anyone who still has issues with her being disinvited."]}
