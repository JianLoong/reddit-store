She's getting invites ready now and after repeatedly having trouble with my SIL Meg I asked her to take her name off the invite list and not send one. My husband is in full support of this but Meg, my MIL and my other SIL Jess. FIL is on my side, as is BIL Rory and SIL Elle.\n\nThe issue is my daughter's middle name and some very hurtful comments Meg made. My maternal family have a tradition that started several generations ago where we give the first girl the middle name Moon. It was a tradition started by an ancestor of mine who believed in nature healing and the story goes she prayed to the moon when she was pregnant with her child believing she was miscarrying and that she believed the moon saved her child and when her daughter was born she gave her the middle name Moon as a tribute and for a few generations after they continued to do this with their first girls as a tribute, but then later it just became this nice, if a little unusual (because of the name) tradition. And the fact it survived a more patriarchal society and was continued even when men usually cared little for their wives family traditions made it special. I'm the first daughter in my family and it's my middle name. My husband was always in love with the idea of continuing and he also thinks it's great that the middle name is more out there/unusual in terms of names.\n\nEarly in my pregnancy Meg made a comment that she hoped we weren't going to give our daughter that \"silly name\" and my husband was like we are, yeah. Meg rolled her eyes and said it's time to end it. My husband told her it was none of her business. Meg asked me a couple of weeks after that what our first name choices were and whether we were trying to make a name sound good with Moon. I told her that my husband and I were not discussing names outside of each other. She told me we'd need help if we're going to do that to our child, meaning give her Moon as a middle name. My husband picked up a mobile of stars for our baby's room and Meg commented that I was weird enough to suggest naming our baby Star. My husband made her leave. Then about two weeks ago she sent me an this word document that was supposed to be an article on middle names being weird could be just as harmful as when first names are weird. And in her message she said that my parents were shitty but it didn't mean I should follow in their footsteps. I told my husband and he told her to go fuck herself already and leave us alone.\n\nSo with all of this, I don't want her there. But Meg is pissed and this has caused a divide among my ILs. Meg said I was selfish and that I was only thinking of myself and not my daughter. First I give her a weird name, then I come between her and her brother and now I am dividing the whole family and leaving her out of a family celebration for her baby niece.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684149916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i5g0r/aita_for_asking_my_best_friend_not_to_invite_my/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This has caused a divide in the family and now I am feeling like I might be an asshole. All because Meg can't accept the fact my daughter's middle name is not her concern. But I also know some might believe she is right and think I am making a mistake by continuing with the tradition. Ultimately it was my decision to say do not invite Meg and now everyone is arguing.

I love the name! And the fact that it your family tradition makes me love it even more since it has a deep meaning to it.  I would say it\u2019s none of SIL\u2019s business what you name your child. I don\u2019t really see someone getting bullied over a middle name since we typically go by first names in school.\n\nThat being said, baby showers are meant to be a positive thing with positive people who support you. SIL seems very toxic and will probably bring down the whole party.  And just imagine if you did change the middle name! You\u2019ll probably never hear the end of it from her and she\u2019ll be bragging about how it was her idea for years to come! I\u2019m glad she is not bullying you into getting her way.\n\nNTA - it\u2019s your party after all, and you want to celebrate with people who love and support you.", "NTA  \n\n\nMeg is a disrespectful person who doesn't understand that she has no place shaming a tradition that's been handed down through the generations.  \n\n\nHonestly I believe that unless you were in on the conception, you have no say in anything regarding the child born of that conception.  YMMV", "NTA! How hard is it for people to keep an opinion to themselves? If she just must say something, say it once and in passing without intent to offend then never mention it again. It\u2019s not her child, it\u2019s yours. She doesn\u2019t get a say in the name.", "NTA not only is it none of her business and she\u2019s being incredibly rude and disrespectful, it\u2019s not even that weird of a name! Seriously. I have friends who work for NASA, so maybe my perspective is skewed, but naming kids after moons or planets isn\u2019t that abnormal. Plus it\u2019s a middle name, your daughter doesn\u2019t have to use it/tell people what it is if she doesn\u2019t want to.", "**Definitely NTA.**\n\nI wonder, though, if you could have conditionally invited Meg to the shower. Meaning that you invite her on the condition that she not bother you about the name anymore, in any way.\n\n**Then unless she both agrees and keeps her word, she's 100% TA.**  \n\\- If she agrees and breaks her word, she's TA.  \n\\- If it's so important to her that she won't agree, she's TA for not coming to the shower.", "NTA If you and your husband are ok with it then she should keep her opinions to herself. You like your middle name so there's a good chance your daughter will too", "NTA\n\nI do not care what anyone else says... the middle name has significance, and you have every right to use that as part of her name. Personally, I do not what the middle names of any of my friends, from school all the way till now.  \n\nI have a brother whose middle name is a family name.  He could have been bullied and such because of it, but nothing happened because he never shared it with anyone at school.  Totally his choice.\n\nIn my family's tradition, the name you give your child is supposed to bless them with for the rest of their life.  My first and middle name mean, G-d's gift of increasing faith.  Every family has its own traditions and it us up to the parents to follow them or start their own new ones.\n\nYour SIL has no respect for you and for your family's tradition.  Why should she be invited to the baby shower?  \n\nIt is Meg's actions that are dividing the family and her lack of respect for you and your family.  Kudos to your husband for having your back.  Meg wants to play stupid games, then she gets to win stupid prizes. \n\nI would never let her near your daughter unless she offers the biggest apology ever!  Then does at least 10 acts of contrition. Just my two cents.", "Moon is very beautiful , sweet and full of poetry. In France we have Luna, Ga\u00efa ( from Earth in greek), Estelle (from Star ) .", "NTA. You did not ask for her opinion, you repeatedly told her her opinion is unwelcome and she is just shoving it down your throats. Sounds like more boundries are the way to go.\n\nAlso, Moon sounds like a lovely middle name.", "NTA. What's up with all these posts about people creating drama over other people's kid's names lately?", "NTA and Moon is such a pretty middle name! \n\nAlso your best friend ISN'T on your side for this? She wants to send Meg an invite even though you and your husband said not to? You need a new best friend, sweetie...", "so you should totally call her Sailor Moon.", "Moon really isn\u2019t that odd. \n\nHonestly SIL seems so obsessed with this I wonder if she\u2019s secretly jealous or something.\n\nNTA.", "Oh please. Moon is a little crunchy, but cute! People are using WAY stranger names these days.\n\nBaby names are a two yes, one no, situation. Luckily Meg\u2019s vote counts for neither because it\u2019s not her darn kid. Find some eloquent, boundaried way to tell Meg and anyone on her side that Meg can be involved in things again when she learns a simple lesson that most of us are taught as kids, but Meg never seemed to understand - when to shut the fuck up.\n\nNTA and congratulations on your growing family!", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere are my ideas\n\n* Selena\n* Azure\n* Bianca\n* Blanche\n* Chiara\n* Lucia\n* Astrid\n* Bertha\n* Candace\n* Snow", "ETA she's the AH for the rude comments. Just tell yourselves they come from a good intention.  But trust me, DO NOT exclude her from the event for this. It's not worth it. Keep the family happy and together. Everyone will eventually get over the name comments, but they'd never get over the exclusion,  which would be all your own fault.  Don't need that bad blood while bringing a baby into this world", "ESH. While it\u2019s not her kid to name, you\u2019d be the ahole for giving the chance your kid could be bullied because of that middle name. Kids are mean in school and sometimes you need to think about future implications like this for your child.
