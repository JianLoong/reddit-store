She's getting invites ready now and after repeatedly having trouble with my SIL Meg I asked her to take her name off the invite list and not send one. My husband is in full support of this but Meg, my MIL and my other SIL Jess. FIL is on my side, as is BIL Rory and SIL Elle.\n\nThe issue is my daughter's middle name and some very hurtful comments Meg made. My maternal family have a tradition that started several generations ago where we give the first girl the middle name Moon. It was a tradition started by an ancestor of mine who believed in nature healing and the story goes she prayed to the moon when she was pregnant with her child believing she was miscarrying and that she believed the moon saved her child and when her daughter was born she gave her the middle name Moon as a tribute and for a few generations after they continued to do this with their first girls as a tribute, but then later it just became this nice, if a little unusual (because of the name) tradition. And the fact it survived a more patriarchal society and was continued even when men usually cared little for their wives family traditions made it special. I'm the first daughter in my family and it's my middle name. My husband was always in love with the idea of continuing and he also thinks it's great that the middle name is more out there/unusual in terms of names.\n\nEarly in my pregnancy Meg made a comment that she hoped we weren't going to give our daughter that \"silly name\" and my husband was like we are, yeah. Meg rolled her eyes and said it's time to end it. My husband told her it was none of her business. Meg asked me a couple of weeks after that what our first name choices were and whether we were trying to make a name sound good with Moon. I told her that my husband and I were not discussing names outside of each other. She told me we'd need help if we're going to do that to our child, meaning give her Moon as a middle name. My husband picked up a mobile of stars for our baby's room and Meg commented that I was weird enough to suggest naming our baby Star. My husband made her leave. Then about two weeks ago she sent me an this word document that was supposed to be an article on middle names being weird could be just as harmful as when first names are weird. And in her message she said that my parents were shitty but it didn't mean I should follow in their footsteps. I told my husband and he told her to go fuck herself already and leave us alone.\n\nSo with all of this, I don't want her there. But Meg is pissed and this has caused a divide among my ILs. Meg said I was selfish and that I was only thinking of myself and not my daughter. First I give her a weird name, then I come between her and her brother and now I am dividing the whole family and leaving her out of a family celebration for her baby niece.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684149916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i5g0r/aita_for_asking_my_best_friend_not_to_invite_my/", "score": 203, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t really see someone getting bullied over a middle name since we typically go by first names in school.\n\nThat being said, baby showers are meant to be a positive thing with positive people who support you.

I have friends who work for NASA, so maybe my perspective is skewed, but naming kids after moons or planets isn\u2019t that abnormal.

Personally, I do not what the middle names of any of my friends, from school all the way till now.  \n\nI have a brother whose middle name is a family name.  He could have been bullied and such because of it, but nothing happened because he never shared it with anyone at school.  Totally his choice.\n\nIn my family's tradition, the name you give your child is supposed to bless them with for the rest of their life.  My first and middle name mean, G-d's gift of increasing faith.  Every family has its own traditions and it us up to the parents to follow them or start their own new ones.\n\nYour SIL has no respect for you and for your family's tradition.  Why should she be invited to the baby shower?  \n\nIt is Meg's actions that are dividing the family and her lack of respect for you and your family.  Kudos to your husband for having your back.

Don't need that bad blood while bringing a baby into this world", "ESH. While it\u2019s not her kid to name, you\u2019d be the ahole for giving the chance your kid could be bullied because of that middle name.
