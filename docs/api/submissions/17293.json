She's getting invites ready now and after repeatedly having trouble with my SIL Meg I asked her to take her name off the invite list and not send one. My husband is in full support of this but Meg, my MIL and my other SIL Jess. FIL is on my side, as is BIL Rory and SIL Elle.\n\nThe issue is my daughter's middle name and some very hurtful comments Meg made. My maternal family have a tradition that started several generations ago where we give the first girl the middle name Moon. It was a tradition started by an ancestor of mine who believed in nature healing and the story goes she prayed to the moon when she was pregnant with her child believing she was miscarrying and that she believed the moon saved her child and when her daughter was born she gave her the middle name Moon as a tribute and for a few generations after they continued to do this with their first girls as a tribute, but then later it just became this nice, if a little unusual (because of the name) tradition. And the fact it survived a more patriarchal society and was continued even when men usually cared little for their wives family traditions made it special. I'm the first daughter in my family and it's my middle name. My husband was always in love with the idea of continuing and he also thinks it's great that the middle name is more out there/unusual in terms of names.\n\nEarly in my pregnancy Meg made a comment that she hoped we weren't going to give our daughter that \"silly name\" and my husband was like we are, yeah. Meg rolled her eyes and said it's time to end it. My husband told her it was none of her business. Meg asked me a couple of weeks after that what our first name choices were and whether we were trying to make a name sound good with Moon. I told her that my husband and I were not discussing names outside of each other. She told me we'd need help if we're going to do that to our child, meaning give her Moon as a middle name. My husband picked up a mobile of stars for our baby's room and Meg commented that I was weird enough to suggest naming our baby Star. My husband made her leave. Then about two weeks ago she sent me an this word document that was supposed to be an article on middle names being weird could be just as harmful as when first names are weird. And in her message she said that my parents were shitty but it didn't mean I should follow in their footsteps. I told my husband and he told her to go fuck herself already and leave us alone.\n\nSo with all of this, I don't want her there. But Meg is pissed and this has caused a divide among my ILs. Meg said I was selfish and that I was only thinking of myself and not my daughter. First I give her a weird name, then I come between her and her brother and now I am dividing the whole family and leaving her out of a family celebration for her baby niece.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1684149916, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13i5g0r/aita_for_asking_my_best_friend_not_to_invite_my/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He could have been bullied and such because of it, but nothing happened because he never shared it with anyone at school.

NTA", "Dude, I\u2019d make everyone t-shirts saying \u201cthe Moonies\u201d and make it a whole obnoxious thing.  NTA", "As everyone else has said, what you name your daughter has nothing at all to do with Meg. It\u2019s weird that\u2019s she\u2019s doubling down on her stance. You are right to not invite her, because she\u2019ll probably try to crowdsource opinions on the matter, and/or openly shame you. NTA", "NTA- I know plenty of people that go by their middle name and not their first name, so it must not be that harmful. It's your child and you get to name her whatever you want, and she can just deal. Your family can feel however they want but they don't get to decide who shows up to support you during your baby shower.", "GODDAMMIT MOON MOON", "Omg I was thinking the same thing reading OP\u2019s story and giggling to myself\u2026Moon Moon, lol."]}
