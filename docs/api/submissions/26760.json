My sister (Mia)\u2019s son is 7 months old and the father is not in her baby\u2019s life at all. He basically dipped the week after the baby was born. I\u2019ve been supporting the both of them financially while my sister Mia gets back on her feet and looks for a job to pay the bills all on her own.\n\nFast forward to 2 days ago, she calls me excitedly, telling me she has big news. Deep down in my heart I already knew what she was about to say and my intuition was confirmed when she said she was pregnant again.\n\nShe went on and on about how she met a new guy she hadn\u2019t told me about and how nice he treats her and the baby. That she really feels like he\u2019s the one and how she can\u2019t wait for the family she was supposed to have.\n\nI basically laid it out straight to her. She hasn\u2019t been dating this guy for very long, and yet she\u2019s already pregnant and wanting to marry him simply because he treats her and the baby \u201cnicely\u201d. He isn\u2019t helping with bills, or providing in anyway. This was not likely to last and she\u2019ll be a single mom of 2. Not to mention how dangerous it is to get pregnant this soon after giving birth.\n\nShe told me I was being \u201cfake\u201d and that I wasn\u2019t acting like family. That I should support her like our mother is. Turns out, our mother is kissing her ass and only enforcing the rose colored glasses Mia has on the situation. Telling her stories of how our stepdad only knew her for 2 months before he married her and blah blah. \n\nI told her that I can\u2019t support her or any other children should she decide to go through with this. I essentially said \u201cI\u2019m not pressuring you into anything. This is your choice, but I refuse to be financing this choice. You\u2019re on your own Mia. I can\u2019t enable you digging yourself further in holes you can\u2019t climb out of cause of irresponsible unplanned pregnancies and I refuse to\u201d\n\nOf course, she didn\u2019t take that well. Started crying and saying how I just don\u2019t want her to be happy, how much of a bitch I am and hung up. Our mother isn\u2019t very happy with me now. I do feel bad. I don\u2019t think I worded it the best, nor should I have called her irresponsible. \n\nI\u2019m just at my breaking point.

She's not entitled to your financial support and you have the right to cut that off.\n\nAlso, it makes me laugh that she calls you fake, because you're the only one being real with her.", "YNTA. You have no obligation to support other peoples kids. You\u2019re a good family for helping her with the one kid she has but bringing another kid into it when she can\u2019t event support the first one is irresponsible. She hasn\u2019t known this guy long enough and only time will tell if he will stick around for the baby. \n\nYou\u2019re 22. You have your own life to live and grow into. You\u2019re a good sister for supporting her and baby 1 but she is living in another universe if she thinks a second child is responsible or okay. Babies only bring more stress, they don\u2019t fix anything. \n\nYou did the right thing. No pressure, it\u2019s her choice, but you can\u2019t afford it financially or psychologically.", "NTA. She's not living in reality. Why on earth did she think that her starting a family with someone else would mean you would continue to financially support her? Does she think you should pay for *another* child? Does she think her new boyfriend will pay for one kid, and you'll pay for her and the other one?\n\nShe's making stupid decisions because she's caught up in the \"romance\" of it. Better to pull the rug out now, before she gets fully used to the idea of you completely supporting her. Stop before it even starts for the new kid. She's a grown adult with more than one child now, she should be able to take care of herself if she can have another child.", "Tell your sister to go after the fathers of the children for child support is not your obligation to support your sister and her immature choices. She needs to be an adult and act like one. It is not up to you to support her if your mother so upset let her support her", "NTA ..\nI often wonder why people have the pleasure of getting pregnant and expect someone else to finance their pregnancy and life????", "Nta, and it sucks that there's kids involved but ur sister will learn the hard way", "Does she not believe in birth control?", "NTA.... It's one thing for her to have a kid with one deadbeat dad, but to get pregnant so quickly with baby #2 before getting married, she's likely to have picked a similar guy who will bolt the moment they have a fight.  You are correct and she's likely to need even more help if or when the second guy leaves.", "NTA you did the right Thing. She needs to be responsible for her own Shit", "NTA, you already did quite alot helping and you are a good family member. You have your own life and you made a right choice in here. NTA again.", "NTA, and experience is a harsh teacher, but sometimes the only effective one.", "NTA. You have every right to stop supporting her. Your mom can do it.", "NTA. Was already kind enough to be paying for the first. Offer to pay for the abortion, but nothing more.", "Sounds like she's making a mistake but you aren't the asshole for trying to help her. She should think carefully before making such an important decision and hopefully she will make the right choice. You can't control her decisions, all you can do is offer advice and support.", "NTA at all. I\u2019m a firm believer of if u can\u2019t support ur own children, then u shouldn\u2019t be having them. She\u2019s being insanely irresponsible. U r in no way obligated to finance her or her children.", "NTA at all. You've been supporting your sister and her baby, hoping it'd be short term, and that she'd find the right guy to take that responsibility off of your shoulders. If she's decided to let another loser who isn't supporting her cum in her after a couple months, she's clearly not making good decisions. Its easy to be nice to a woman for a couple months when all you have to do is show up, talk sweet, and bone while someone else pays - that's not the same as building a solid foundation, taking a role in the finances, and working toward a long term goal. \n\nThis situation sucks, and I'm sorry you're in the middle of this, OP, and while maybe you were a bit harsh, you spoke the truth. Of course you want your sister to be happy, but not at your expense for the indefinite future. You're 22, and you could be putting that money away for your own future. And a person who helps the way you have is the ultimate type of person who deserves a bright future and a loving family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
