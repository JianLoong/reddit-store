I\u2019ve been supporting the both of them financially while my sister Mia gets back on her feet and looks for a job to pay the bills all on her own.\n\nFast forward to 2 days ago, she calls me excitedly, telling me she has big news. Deep down in my heart I already knew what she was about to say and my intuition was confirmed when she said she was pregnant again.\n\nShe went on and on about how she met a new guy she hadn\u2019t told me about and how nice he treats her and the baby. That she really feels like he\u2019s the one and how she can\u2019t wait for the family she was supposed to have.\n\nI basically laid it out straight to her. She hasn\u2019t been dating this guy for very long, and yet she\u2019s already pregnant and wanting to marry him simply because he treats her and the baby \u201cnicely\u201d. He isn\u2019t helping with bills, or providing in anyway. This was not likely to last and she\u2019ll be a single mom of 2. Not to mention how dangerous it is to get pregnant this soon after giving birth.\n\nShe told me I was being \u201cfake\u201d and that I wasn\u2019t acting like family. That I should support her like our mother is. Turns out, our mother is kissing her ass and only enforcing the rose colored glasses Mia has on the situation. Telling her stories of how our stepdad only knew her for 2 months before he married her and blah blah. \n\nI told her that I can\u2019t support her or any other children should she decide to go through with this. I essentially said \u201cI\u2019m not pressuring you into anything. This is your choice, but I refuse to be financing this choice. You\u2019re on your own Mia. I can\u2019t enable you digging yourself further in holes you can\u2019t climb out of cause of irresponsible unplanned pregnancies and I refuse to\u201d\n\nOf course, she didn\u2019t take that well. Started crying and saying how I just don\u2019t want her to be happy, how much of a bitch I am and hung up. Our mother isn\u2019t very happy with me now. I do feel bad.

You\u2019re a good sister for supporting her and baby 1 but she is living in another universe if she thinks a second child is responsible or okay.

She's not living in reality. Why on earth did she think that her starting a family with someone else would mean you would continue to financially support her? Does she think you should pay for *another* child? Does she think her new boyfriend will pay for one kid, and you'll pay for her and the other one?\n\nShe's making stupid decisions because she's caught up in the \"romance\" of it. Better to pull the rug out now, before she gets fully used to the idea of you completely supporting her. Stop before it even starts for the new kid. She's a grown adult with more than one child now, she should be able to take care of herself if she can have another child.", "Tell your sister to go after the fathers of the children for child support is not your obligation to support your sister and her immature choices. She needs to be an adult and act like one.

It's one thing for her to have a kid with one deadbeat dad, but to get pregnant so quickly with baby #2 before getting married, she's likely to have picked a similar guy who will bolt the moment they have a fight.  You are correct and she's likely to need even more help if or when the second guy leaves.", "NTA you did the right Thing. She needs to be responsible for her own Shit", "NTA, you already did quite alot helping and you are a good family member. You have your own life and you made a right choice in here. NTA again.", "NTA, and experience is a harsh teacher, but sometimes the only effective one.", "NTA. You have every right to stop supporting her. Your mom can do it.", "NTA. Was already kind enough to be paying for the first. Offer to pay for the abortion, but nothing more.", "Sounds like she's making a mistake but you aren't the asshole for trying to help her. She should think carefully before making such an important decision and hopefully she will make the right choice. You can't control her decisions, all you can do is offer advice and support.", "NTA at all. I\u2019m a firm believer of if u can\u2019t support ur own children, then u shouldn\u2019t be having them. She\u2019s being insanely irresponsible. U r in no way obligated to finance her or her children.", "NTA at all. You've been supporting your sister and her baby, hoping it'd be short term, and that she'd find the right guy to take that responsibility off of your shoulders. If she's decided to let another loser who isn't supporting her cum in her after a couple months, she's clearly not making good decisions. Its easy to be nice to a woman for a couple months when all you have to do is show up, talk sweet, and bone while someone else pays - that's not the same as building a solid foundation, taking a role in the finances, and working toward a long term goal. \n\nThis situation sucks, and I'm sorry you're in the middle of this, OP, and while maybe you were a bit harsh, you spoke the truth. Of course you want your sister to be happy, but not at your expense for the indefinite future. You're 22, and you could be putting that money away for your own future. And a person who helps the way you have is the ultimate type of person who deserves a bright future and a loving family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had a very hard time distinguishing the line between helping and enabling until I was nearly. Your sister will never become an adult without facing her own consequences.

At 22 you should be building the foundation of your own life, not parenting your older sister.", "22-year-olds should not have to support their 25-year-old sister financially. She should make do with what she can make herself or what her new family unit can afford. You will need all the earning power you have to build up your own life.

How on earth can she expect you to finance her and two children? Her level of entitlement is impressive.

She has that time to go after child support from her baby daddy and if needed move in with your mom. \n\nYou are young. You should be finishing college, building your career, and getting married soon. Supporting your sister is impeding your own life. Stop it! Otherwise your whole life will be spent this way.

She should be ashamed that her younger sister is financially supporting her for her lack of responsibility and stupid decision making.", "NTA\n\nYour older sister lives in a fantasy world and expects others to finance it for her. She took the wrong message away from your initial help with the first baby. She's not inclined to learn any differently, so it is best for you to just cut her off. She can whine and cry about it; your mother can be her enabler. Just stay firm with you decision to remove yourself from bailing her out of her choices. That is THE ONLY way she's going to have to face reality. She needs to go after both fathers to get child support. It's their job, along with your sister to pay for the babies they create - not yours. She can get public assistance, WIC, charity to help her make it. It may be hard to watch her struggle; but she's got to do this without your regular or frequent help. Otherwise, she will always have you on the hook for more.", "NTA.

Why she out here having unprotected sex? I can\u2019t fathom why she would be happy with no job. Some people only learn from tough love. She\u2019s grown and should have to deal with the consequences of her choices. Congratulate her and give her a deadline to be out of your house if she\u2019s living with you. Maybe your mom can take her in and support her financially since she disagrees with your advice.", "NTA. \n\nYour sister sounds incredibly childish and, frankly, I wouldn't be surprised if this time next year the new bf has dipped on her as well and then she'll be a single mother of 2.\n\nShe needs to focus on being a good mother and providing for the kid she has, not screwing around making more!", "NTA and definitely stop paying for her immediately!", "It sounds like your sister has an addictive personality. I have some experience with that and attend a support group, Al-Anon, for people who have addicts in their lives. One of the precepts they teach us is that you can't change people; they have to change on their own. They have to find their own bottom before they climb back up. If you support them before they recover, then you are only slowing their descent and delaying their crash while draining your own resources. The time to help is after they have bottomed out and are climbing back. That's encouraging good behaviour, not bad.\n\nNTA.", "As the saying goes: \"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes\".\n\nIn this case, the stupid prize is her no longer having a free ride financially,  courtesy of OP, no responsibility for her own actions, or self-realisation/accountability.\n\nNTA", "Oh love  you couldn't have worded it any better, it exactly tells her where she is wrong and provides a gist of the consequences coming along in the future", "If your mom is so excited for her, they can live together and she can help with the two babies", "NTA either she\u2019s an idiot, or just looking for a way to make everyone else take care of her.

Her sister is an irresponsible, entitled leech. What does she expect OP to do? Provide for her for the rest of her life while she gets repeatedly knocked up by every \"true love\" she meets? - Let's be honest, no one thinks this one will last.) The mother is also delusional - it's nice that her own quick relationship actually worked out but if she wants the same thing for her daughter, she should be the one providing for her. I assume that's why she's angry at OP - she's eager to support Mia emotionally (because that costs nothing) but she doesn't want to spend her money on her.", "I would add that if your mother gives you shit about this, send your sister and her expenses to your mother.

I know it's just your opinion, but I think she worded it fine. Heck, many people would've been even more stern considering the situation her sister has gotten herself into is mind blowing. They're both so young, and the younger sister is supporting her? When she's just one year past being able to buy herself a drink? Not to mention that their mother is completely on board with Mia, and upset with OP for deciding to cut her off financially? Many other sisters would've completely lost it on her! It also sounds like Mia and the mother are probably closer and more alike, therefore I wouldn't be surprised if she always has Mia's back when she makes bonehead decisions. Their mother emphasizing that she also got married after 2 months while Mia is fantasizing about her new beau is completely irresponsible. Yes, meeting someone, falling in love, getting married after 3 weeks and having 40 years of wedded bliss does happen, but unions like this are the exception, not the rule, and everyone knows this. Heck, I got married at 19, closed escrow on my first home at 22 while my husband and I were expecting our first child, and have managed to have an absolutely wonderful 26 year marriage with 3 amazing children, but I would NEVER advocate for my children to attempt to follow in our footsteps...ever. My husband and I have been incredibly blessed, and I'm old enough to know how rare our love story is. The likelihood that our children will be able to repeat our good fortune with odds such as extreme youth and still being in college is slight, and the same is true for OP's sister Mia. I truly hope she will be the exception, but she is stacking the odds against herself on top of the one's life already has. Not to mention that she's doing all this will being financially supported by her little sister? Her audacity and lack of responsibility boggles the mind, frankly. I think she needs a wake up call and fast, because she seems to be forgetting one crucial factor: She is about to be responsible for the care and well-being of 2 children! She's got to start making better choices, yesterday, because children need money and stability, she doesn't have either, and she doesn't seem to be concerned about her lack of them.
