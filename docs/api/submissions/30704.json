You are probably a constant reminder for her that she was once separated from your father and he was with someone else during that time. Her pressuring to call you mom is a very strong indicator that she wants to act like everything is good with your family to cover up her own inability to deal with it. Otherwise she would accept you for who you are: an additional child to care for, co-created by the father of her own children. If you were the result of cheating, her feelings would be a little more understandable (treatment still not okay), but they were broken up. \n\nWe don't even need to mention that talking bad about your mother in front of you is not okay. \n\nForcing religion onto adults: never okay, imo.
