I have 2 large Bernese Mountain dogs.  I've had them both for longer than I've been with my BF.  They are like my babies.  My BF likes them, but he doesn't do much in regards to caring for them.  We live in a duplex and don't really have a yard, so I have to walk them or take them to a dog park to get their energy out. I work from home so it's pretty easy for me to take them out for a 15-30 minute walk on breaks or lunch and then a longer walk after work. My BF very, very rarely takes my dogs out.  Sure, he'll feed them and give them water, but he doesn't really play with them or do anything else to care for them.\n\nLast week I received some bad news.  My grandma, who lives about a 12-hour drive away, had a fall and broke her hip.  She lives on her own and doesn't have anyone else to care for her.  My parents live overseas and aren't in a position to come back to help her.  I'm literally the only person she has that can help.  So, of course I volunteered to go take care of her.  I took a leave of absence from my job (they've been very understanding and I'm so grateful).  \n\nI told my BF my plan to go help my grandma and told him that he's going to have to take care of my dogs while I'm gone.  His first question was how long I am going to be gone, but I don't have an answer for that.  There's not really a timetable for how long my grandma is going to need help.  I am going to look into caregivers when I get there, but I have no idea how long that will take.  I don't like that it's open-ended either, but my grandma needs help and I'm the only one who can give it.\n\nMy BF told me he doesn't want the responsibility of taking care of my dogs and that I should put them in a long-term kennel while I'm gone.  He said that I'm asking too much of him and that he doesn't think he can give them the proper care.  He doesn't work from home and has a 45-minute commute, so he's going to be out of the house for about 10 hours every day.  He said he's not going to have the energy to walk them when he gets home.  \n\nI explained to him that I can't afford to kennel them for so long, especially when I don't know how long I'll be gone.  I don't have anyone else that can take them in or come stay with us either.  I explained to him that I need his help right now just like my grandma needs my help.  I told him I know this isn't ideal, but it's something we need to work through together.  \n\nHe isn't refusing to help with my dogs, but he's made it very clear he doesn't want to do it.  I'm trying to make it as easy as possible for him by teaching him everything my dogs need, but he's constantly rolling his eyes or giving me a hard time about it and keeps bringing up his kennel idea.  \n\nFinally, I just snapped at him and told him that I'm already stressed out enough as it is and that I don't need him adding extra stress right now.  I told him that taking care of my dogs is not hard and that he's just going to have to suck it up.", "created_utc": 1668110632, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrq8if/aita_for_refusing_to_put_my_2_dogs_in_a_longterm/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have 2 large Bernese Mountain dogs.  I've had them both for longer than I've been with my BF.  They are like my babies.  My BF likes them, but he doesn't do much in regards to caring for them.  We live in a duplex and don't really have a yard, so I have to walk them or take them to a dog park to get their energy out. I work from home so it's pretty easy for me to take them out for a 15-30 minute walk on breaks or lunch and then a longer walk after work. My BF very, very rarely takes my dogs out.  Sure, he'll feed them and give them water, but he doesn't really play with them or do anything else to care for them.\n\nLast week I received some bad news.  My grandma, who lives about a 12-hour drive away, had a fall and broke her hip.  She lives on her own and doesn't have anyone else to care for her.  My parents live overseas and aren't in a position to come back to help her.  I'm literally the only person she has that can help.  So, of course I volunteered to go take care of her.  I took a leave of absence from my job (they've been very understanding and I'm so grateful).  \n\nI told my BF my plan to go help my grandma and told him that he's going to have to take care of my dogs while I'm gone.  His first question was how long I am going to be gone, but I don't have an answer for that.  There's not really a timetable for how long my grandma is going to need help.  I am going to look into caregivers when I get there, but I have no idea how long that will take.  I don't like that it's open-ended either, but my grandma needs help and I'm the only one who can give it.\n\nMy BF told me he doesn't want the responsibility of taking care of my dogs and that I should put them in a long-term kennel while I'm gone.  He said that I'm asking too much of him and that he doesn't think he can give them the proper care.  He doesn't work from home and has a 45-minute commute, so he's going to be out of the house for about 10 hours every day.  He said he's not going to have the energy to walk them when he gets home.  \n\nI explained to him that I can't afford to kennel them for so long, especially when I don't know how long I'll be gone.  I don't have anyone else that can take them in or come stay with us either.  I explained to him that I need his help right now just like my grandma needs my help.  I told him I know this isn't ideal, but it's something we need to work through together.  \n\nHe isn't refusing to help with my dogs, but he's made it very clear he doesn't want to do it.  I'm trying to make it as easy as possible for him by teaching him everything my dogs need, but he's constantly rolling his eyes or giving me a hard time about it and keeps bringing up his kennel idea.  \n\nFinally, I just snapped at him and told him that I'm already stressed out enough as it is and that I don't need him adding extra stress right now.  I told him that taking care of my dogs is not hard and that he's just going to have to suck it up.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP describes he does the basics like feeding and giving water. He doesn't play or walk them. He never agreed to do it and with his work life balance that's impossible to begin with. OP chose to get those dogs and she can ask her SO to take care of them, but he is allowed to say no. And when he does, it's on her, to figure smth out. And let's face it, having 2 big dogs locked up 10 hours in a row without going potty is nuts. And even if he manages to \"suck it up\" and walk them before and after walk, that wouldn't be a proper walk. She is basically abandoning her dogs for an identified period of time knowing they won't have proper care. Kennels are expensive? She should've thought about it when she got them. Dog walkers exist for a reason, lol", "He feeds them, gives them water. He doesn\u2019t walk them because he\u2019s out of the house 10 hours a day whereas the owner is wfh. What compromises does he need to make?", "**Would they damage the interior?** They are a big ass rowdy dog breed.\n\nRealistically, **will they damage the house if left alone at home 10+ hours without midday walks day after day?**", "Have you checked apps like Rover? You won\u2019t see them on Facebook but it\u2019s a great resource if it\u2019s available.", "I mean she stays with him she better pay for the kennel anyway. I wouldn\u2019t trust this person with animals. Clearly he doesn\u2019t care.", "Yeah it's weird right", "I'm curious, at what point do you feel a live-in couple begins to share commitments? If he was just a roommate then sure they aren't his dogs or responsibility but in my mind once partners move in together they assume a level of responsibility and commitment to each other and one another's pets brought in to the partnership. How long do they need to be together before they are both of their pets and shared responsibilities? Never unless it's a brand new shiny pet they get once together? After marriage?", "To me yes. I had 2 older family members go through the same thing my mom (72) & my Grandma (95). The hospital would NOT discharge my grandmother to a family member she had to go to a rehab facility to make sure she could get around on her own & do everything she could before her injury. She was not released to family/her assisted living home until that time.", "this - and even potentially dangerous for everyone. Dogs not used to BF giving them orders - taking care of them, OP gone, dogs might react pretty bad and take very bad habits. Can't even understand how people think leaving dog with someone not used to them, gone ten hours a day is an option. And OP not seeing that makes her an AH.", "Big dogs have bigger bladders and can generally go longer without needing to go out. Sure, it's better for them to have more time out, but they'd survive for a few weeks if they got walked in the morning and evening. My big dogs go 10+ hours without peeing regularly, even when I let them out more frequently. My friends have a husky but no yard and they walk first thing in the morning, then later at night, so that's also more than 10 hours between walks, and he's always been fine with it. Lots of people with dogs work full-time and commute.", ">Why don\u2019t you look for other options?\n\nBecause I'm supposed to leave tomorrow and I don't have the time to find something like that.  We don't have a lot of options in our area, it's pretty rural.  There's only 1 kennel and 1 doggie daycare within an hour drive.  There aren't dog-walking companies or anything like that here.  My BF is my only option, just like I'm my grandma's only option.", "> you just do not want to - to make your life easier.\n\nNot to make my life easier, to make sure that my grandma has an environment that she can properly recover in.", "*Say it louder for the people in the back!*\n\nNo matter how many \"dog mom\" and \"furbaby\" stickers are plastered on a car, dogs aren't kids.", "I know I'm asking a lot of him, I get that and I sympathize with him.  But I also feel like if the situation were reversed and he needed something like this from me, I wouldn't hesitate for a second to do whatever it takes.", "No one\u2019s required to love animals. Looking after another\u2019s pets is a huge responsibility regardless of the relationship. Expecting long term care from someone who really doesn\u2019t want to is an asshole move.", "Taking care of animals is a big responsibility just because someone does not want to have that responsibility doesnt mean their a bad person", "I\u2019d say it varies by relationship. Some people may jump right in and see the pets as both of theirs. This is clearly not the case in this relationship though. OP said her bf does very little for the dogs the way it is.", "pet ownership should stay with who the adopting parent is. if this couple broke up tomorrow, do you think the dogs would be their dogs, or her dogs?", "^This! He moved in knowing OP was committed and highly attached to the dogs. What did he think would happen in certain circumstances? This one is where OP *technically* has the choice to engage an emergency but what if it was something that happened to OP and there was no choice to disengage? Was he going to push OP to re-home the dogs because he doesn't wanna deal?", "When both partners explicitly agree that the pets are their shared responsibility.", "Yes, but these dogs are used to being at home with OP all day. Going from that to  being home alone all day is a huge difference.", "My Dane is the same. He goes out three times a day when I work. Hes okay with it.", "What is your plan if he decided to break up with you? What is the contingency plan here?\n\nI mean I love dogs and I am totally empathetic to your situation but the way you are acting/communicating would push anyone away. It\u2019s not a healthy environment for the dogs to leave them cooped up for 10+ hours a day with no end date.", "If your dogs are energetic and need to be walked twice a day do you really think they'll be OK with being alone for 10 hours straight?? You don't think they'll become destructive? I think your only option is to take them with you and separate them from your grandma. Your plan to leave them with your bf just doesn't seem plausible.", "Take the dogs with you and find options near your grandmother.  Leaving your dogs with someone who a) cannot look after them and  b) does not want to look after them can lead to problems", "Sounds like your going to need to figure out other options because the BF has stated he isn\u2019t an option.", "Surely there is a way to sequester the dogs in one part of the house while she\u2019s in another - she\u2019s not going to need you up her butt 24/7, you can make it work taking the dogs with you if it\u2019s important enough to you.", "The answer is do not be with someone that cant reciprocate what you give them.", "Check with local Bernese clubs, someone would watch them for you. Bernese owners are definitely a \u201cdifferent breed.\u201d", "That's how I feel too. I don't think op necessarily went about this the right way but she's also overwhelmed trying to accommodate everything else going on. Did he really plan on committing to this relationship without having the commitment to step up when needed for the dogs? I get not completely seeing yourself as the co-owner but not being responsible for them at all is incredibly short sighted.", "I like that answer, that's a very good threshold to use for sharing commitment and responsibility. I think that should be a discussion prior to even moving in together really but clearly that's a hindsight moment for op", "Yeah that's fair! Unless she's super confident in their ability to be alone based on other times they've both been out all day, them having separation issues is the biggest potential problem.", "Leave the tv on. It\u2019ll be fine.", ">What is your plan if he decided to break up with you?\n\nYou mean like while I'm gone helping my grandma?", "You\u2019re taking the stance \u201ctake my responsibility and deal with it, for however long it might be. I don\u2019t want to spend money on something that was originally my responsibility so you need to suck it up, I\u2019m making you do this\u201d \n\nNo one is going to respond positively to that. And realistically what will you do if he breaks up with you? Is this your house, his house or a rental? Maybe grandma should come stay with you guys instead."]}
