It\u2019s an old ricotta cheese container actually. He looked like a deer in the headlights. He then dumped the cup of pee into the freaking sink. Rinsed and put cup into the cabinet.  I\u2019m standing there totally disgusted. This is my sink. (It\u2019s an old house single sink - he usually during the day uses only the other bathroom down the hall). I brush my teeth here. I place my hairdryer and straightener in this sink while using. I lay my clothes over it when getting dressed. Oh my god he puts pee in there. He dumps it. Sloshed it with water once. Dumps that then he\u2019s done. Says it\u2019s no big deal and has done this for awhile now but I\u2019m truly disturbed by this. Tried talking as I know standing for guys especially as they age is easier but dang stand at the toilet. He says he likes doing this better so he doesn\u2019t really have to aim. I then said pour the pee into hmmmmm I don\u2019t know maybe the toilet!  Then use the shower to fill and rinse. Don\u2019t use the sink!  He completely dismissed my feelings. Said I\u2019m overreacting. Help me understand.

If he doesn\u2019t want to aim, he can sit on the toilet seat.", "His explanation of not wanting to have to aim is sus. Idk what it would be, but i don\u2019t think that\u2019s the full story. NTA", "NTA. Sit down and tell him in small words that what he is doing is completely unacceptable. It\u2019s disgusting and he knows it (deer in headlights says it all). Do not accept this behaviour!!!", "NTA. That's F'n gross!", "NTA So you're overreacting and it's not a big deal? So then he wouldn't care if you told other people about his nasty little habit, right?", "That deer in the headlights look is the visual signal that he knows he was doing something wrong, he's just too ashamed to back down over it now.", "NTA WTF did I just read?! Is he an elderly man who has tremors? Why on earth would he use a make shift urinal that\u2019s just gross and LAZY! Use the toilet someday you won\u2019t be able to and wish you could.", "NTA\nWhat a disgusting and bizarre flex. You say you often apologize for his misdeeds and that he's a narcissist, they're pretty good at gaslighting and breaking down the people closest to them for their \"supply\". Is he manipulative and degrading in other ways? Do you have a support system if needed? Relationships with these types of people can be devastatingly abusive.", "Why was he peeing into a cup? Because he was going to drink it, it\u2019s obvious.", "I\u2019m more concerned around the casual rinsing of the cup and putting it back in the cupboard. \n\nThis is very bizarre behaviour. NTA", "Nta. Worth mentioning another issue with his behavior is that you'll probably never buy Ricotta cheese again", "As a man even I find what did just wrong on every level.", "No just because they get older men don't pee in cups. It's just \ud83e\udd22", "NTA, but yelling at him isn\u2019t going to stop it.", "Yeah, it's kinda strange. But you're definitely overreacting. It's just your own husband's pee.", "Yep and he\u2019s all mine", "He actually has never ever read anything on here. Shocking but true.", "Hahaha, of course there is a Sub on it ...", "Risky click of the day\u2026", "He\u2019s a bit of a narcissist. Mind games are his specialty. I lose 99% of the time.", "I guess he is too short? But yeah, I would say turning the water on then pissing in the sink & lwtting the water run for another minute would be best", "I would have a meltdown and throw out the entire husband.", "Then he might use the kitchen sink.  \n\nTell him if he can't stand and aim, he'll need to sit on toilet and point it down. If he refuses, let him know you'll need to toss out all the dishes and he's on his own until he stops this unsanitary behavior.", "It sounds like MORE effort than just peeing in the toilet to me - which makes it make even less sense!", "Nope and honestly ricotta is now a trigger. Haha", "Unfortunately you can't return him to where you got him  :( \n\nBut you don't have to keep him!\n\nPS bleach all your sinks.", "You kept the receipt, yes?", "He's disgusting.", "I was intrigued. Very disturbed to find men are out there peeing directly into public bathroom sinks. Another reason not to use unisex bathrooms.", "I clicked. Can\u2018t unclick. What on earth did I just read", "Sounds fun. Is that really how you want to spend your time on earth?", "Get rid of him \ud83e\udd28", "Ya know it's hard for him to beat you in his own game if you just refuse to play...\n\nEdit: grammar", "Sounds like a great reason to stop playing and walk off the pitch.", "Must be nice being married to him.", "Why you married to him girl", "This is your issue. The pee is just a drop in the sink. Why are you with him? Don\u2019t you deserve better?", "No it wouldn't! That's gross too!", "I so appreciate your sense of hunor \ud83d\ude02 NTA what the hell is this man doing? You're being incredibly gracious to even entertain accommodating this weird habit of his. Honestly if he has that much trouble aiming maybe he needs to see a doctor? But in any case it's not harder to dump pee into the toilet than it is to dump it into the sink. He just can't insist on this, you're being way more than understanding.", "It is, but it's still considerably better than what he's doing currently!  Throw the whole man out, he can even keep his old container as a consolation prize!", "If I\u2019m being honest he is a narcissist. He can be absolutely fine if things are good. But when I talk or try to about anything that I feel strongly about he gets mean. Like goes days without saying a word to me. I usually just apologize just to make it stop. This is just weird what he\u2019s doing now", "Ok, to put this as gently as I can, that's cause for serious concern. You deserve to be heard in your marriage and no one should be weaponizing silence against you. You may want to consider the possibility that he is on his way to escalating to more dangerous behaviors if he's gone from icing you out to actively trying to disgust you. I can't tell you what to do in your own relationship, obviously, but from one survivor to another, I would recommend thinking about exit strategies. The fact that he's a narcissist paints this behavior in an entirely different light.", "You're nowhere near as concerned by this behaviour as you should be.", "Exactly what **REDEEMING** qualities does he have?", "Your husband is a pissant."]}
