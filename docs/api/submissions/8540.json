I was excited for him and I told him (when she went to the bathroom) that if things went well they could use my spare bedroom as long as he cleaned up. \n\nWell the night went well and they came back to my place and did their thing. I passed out and woke up in the morning to just my friend in the apartment. I guess she left early. \n\nAnyway my friend cleaned up the room and had it looking spotless. \n\nEverything was good until my wife came home and found out what happened. She's furious I let a stranger into the house and let them sleep in our spare room. I guess I should of had more communication with her before i gave the okay to my friend.

Don't let strangers into a living space you share with another person without that person's consent.

Apologize, admit you were wrong, and move on. I don\u2019t believe this was worthy of a Reddit post.", "YTA \n\nbecause this is basically your wife was out for the night and instantly you have a complete stranger (female) come to your house for sex.   Granted, you claim to have been several feet away from the sex acts,  but that is extremely shady.", "Hmm yeah should've got the okay from your wife first. YTA but it's not super serious.", "YTA. Neither of you knew that woman. She could have been ANYONE! If your friend couldn't afford a hotel room, you could have sprung for it. Please respect your wife's space.", "YTA How would you feel if your wife allowed her friend to bring some random dude into your house for sex?", "NTA. Sure she could have stolen things, but all of life is a risk. The rewards of helping your romantically unsuccessful friend have a nice night easily outweigh the small chance of a getting a few pieces of jewelry or some some loose cash stollen. \n\nI feel like so many people (especially on the internet and places like here) spend so much time defending themselves against and assuming the worst of other people and end up denying themselves a lot of happiness. Most people are decent people. \n\nAnd its not like she was a completely unvetted person. Your buddy spend a lot of time talking to her and presumably you talked to her for a decent bit too if you where all hanging out.", "NTA, mountain out of a molehill.\n\nWhat was this woman going to do?  Kidnap the people in the house and make a horror movie?", "NAH - if wife was home at the time I would say yeah you should have cleared it with her beforehand but she wasn\u2019t. people saying YTA are acting like you slept with this woman yourself.", "YTA if I were your wife I would be PISSED. That woman was a total stranger, and could have stolen everything you own.", "Sorry, mate, I'm leaning towards YTA. Even though he cleaned up the room, well, just the thought of a stranger in my home having a one-night stand with a friend sounds pretty disgusting. Go apologize and kiss that lovely wife of yours.", "NTA, and I'd have done the same. \n\nIs your wife mad because she suspects this is a cover story for your cheating or is she mad because the woman from the bar *could* have stolen things (but didn't)? Assuming you haven't previously given her good reasons to be suspicious, the former sounds like an unhealthy lack of trust. The latter just seems like a wild overreaction to a situation in which literally nothing bad happened.", "NAH; if they hadn't cleaned up you would definitely be T A but this is pretty mid since nothing happened.  Doesn't sound likely to happen again but run it past your wife next time just to be sure everyone is on the same page.", "INFO\n\n> I should of had more communication with her\n\nOf?", "NTA- it's your house too! It wasn't a stranger, it was a friend. \nYour wife is being oddly concerned about this IMO.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know about your wife but I'd find it disgusting if people spilled their body fluids on my furniture ngl", "Are you 18/19? Listening thru the wall?  \n\n\nthey should have found their own accommodations.  youmowe wifey a huge apology. Grow up.", "NTA. Women commenting YTA here don't understand how impossibly difficult it is for most men to get with a girl. You were a fucking hero of a friend to this guy. Wife should understand that. Honestly you sound like a fucking legend OP.", "Yep, the op doesn't quite get that the wife was mad about the other woman coming in the house, not his friend.", "So like someone who has roommate(s) should call each of them and ask permission before they have a one night stand?", "for a paranoid person, it is. Most people don't assume your husband is having a menage", "How is that shady? He didn\u2019t have sex. He didn\u2019t watch, it was behind closed doors.  Sure, the wife was out partying with friends and not coming home, isn\u2019t that similarly shady too? He should trust her, and she should trust him.", "I get OP's wife being uncomfortable but i don't think it has anything to do with being cheating adjacent like you're implying..", "Ahhh i wouldn't care at all", "The wife isn't upset about the friend, she's upset about the woman the friend brought into the house. She is the stranger, not the friend.", "Lmao the random woman at the bar is now his friend??", "The woman was a stranger...", "But which one came first?", "They should have an agreement for guests. It isn't unreasonable for someone not to want strangers coming in and out of where they live.", "Someone with roomates should have a pre-established agreement on what would make everyone comfortable. There are many situations where no one cares and many where its a very clear no random guests rule.", "> How is that shady?\n\nthe part where a complete stranger had sex in his house when his wife is not around.   That was the shady part.", "Lol well I assume OP and his wife didn\u2019t have any such agreement if he\u2019s that surprised she\u2019s upset, so let\u2019s say the hypothetical roommates don\u2019t either - you need to ask each permission in that case? Kids in dorms should\u2019ve asked before putting that sock on the door, let\u2019s say?", "I agree 100%, just like OP and his wife should have a pre-established agreement on who\u2019s allowed in the house too. But it sounds like they didn\u2019t, so here we are.", "You're joking right?", "Yes. You (general \"you\") ask your roommates, who may have valuable shit they care about, for permission before inviting a stranger in. Their safety is more important than you getting laid.", "No pre-established agreement =/= do whatever you want.\n\nIt means you ask.", "Eh.. She would have no reason to anticipate her HUSBAND bringing a random stranger from a bar home. Thats not really a boundary that should have to be spoken\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02", "Imagine a husband and wife. The wife is really into painting. Her husband comes home one day to find her and a woman he\u2019s never met chatting on the couch. She tells him \u201choney this is so-and-so, we met today in my art class and she asked if she could come see some of my pieces.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d say the husband would be justified being furious at his wife?\n\nAlso if it wasn\u2019t clear, NAH for OPs situation. Now you know for next time.", "I wonder how she'd feel if OP and his friend had instead befriended some guy they met at the bar and brought him back just to hang out. \n\nI've never lived in a roommate situation or with a partner where we had specific rules about not bringing strangers into the home. I would never assume that was default forbidden without a conversation about it. I've had both roommates and cohabitating boyfriends who did so semi-regularly without consequence, I've done it without consequence, this all seems like some silly paranoid read-too-much-true-crime shit. \n\nNot saying OP's wife has no right to be uncomfortable, but the appropriate response would be \"uh please don't do that again\" not FURY.", "But he didn't, so it's also not a boundary that was crossed. If her husband had brought home a random woman from a bar, she would have reasons to object that don't apply here.", "I think context matters here. I wouldn't blame the husband in that scenario for being annoyed, but I think what adds to the wife's reaction here is he offered up a room in their house to a stranger just so his friend could fuck.\n\nAdditionally, the friend in the scenario you proposed isn't being left unattended over night.", "Is the wife's new friend sleeping over, and being left unsupervised for extended periods of time?", "Hun, he did. He didnt bring her home for himself but he did lol", "I'm not understanding why the fact that his friend -- whose sexual behavior the wife has no reason to care about one way or the other -- brought back a woman to fuck instead of to see the art collection makes any difference. She is still just as much of a stranger. And she wasn't unattended -- a good friend whom the husband knew well and trusted was with her the whole time she was in the home.", "Ok. Personally I'd find that way overbearing, so I think we just fundamentally disagree then. Which is fine. \n\nEither way, I appreciate you adding that context could matter. Because the sense I got from many of the responses here (at least at first, tbf I haven't looked in a while) is that they thought the sex part made it worse, but left it out because there's no real argument against it besides \"it's gross.\" \n\nBut maybe I'm wrong, who am I", "No, the friend did. The husband had nothing to do with it. He wasn't even at the bar with them as far as I can tell, let alone bringing the woman home from it.", "The husband brought the friend and stranger into the home. You can not be this dense. The friend would not be there without the husband. The stranger would not have been there without his ok \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nEta: and he is who suggested the friend bring the girl back\ud83d\ude44", "What I meant when I said that if the husband had been the one who brought home the woman, there would have been reasons for her to be upset that didn't apply here, was this: if the husband went out and picked up a woman in a bar himself, his wife would have reason to be upset *no matter where they went to have sex from there*. If he'd brought her home, it would have been no different than if he'd taken her to a hotel, or somebody else's house... his wife *still* would have equal reason to be upset. \n\nThat's the part which doesn't apply here. If he took a woman to somewhere that wasn't his home, it would be no less of an offense than if he took a woman to the place that was. But that doesn't apply to the friend, whom one presumes SHOULD be free to pick up a woman for sex and take her to someplace which has nothing to do with the married couple.\n\nThose extra reasons -- in short, the fact that her husband would have been arranging to have sex, himself, with someone who wasn't his wife -- are the *primary* reasons it would matter to most women that their husbands brought home a woman from a bar. And those reasons aren't relevant in this case."]}
