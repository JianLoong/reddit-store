If her husband had brought home a random woman from a bar, she would have reasons to object that don't apply here.", "I think context matters here. I wouldn't blame the husband in that scenario for being annoyed, but I think what adds to the wife's reaction here is he offered up a room in their house to a stranger just so his friend could fuck.\n\nAdditionally, the friend in the scenario you proposed isn't being left unattended over night.", "Is the wife's new friend sleeping over, and being left unsupervised for extended periods of time?", "Hun, he did.

She is still just as much of a stranger. And she wasn't unattended -- a good friend whom the husband knew well and trusted was with her the whole time she was in the home.", "Ok. Personally I'd find that way overbearing, so I think we just fundamentally disagree then. Which is fine. \n\nEither way, I appreciate you adding that context could matter. Because the sense I got from many of the responses here (at least at first, tbf I haven't looked in a while) is that they thought the sex part made it worse, but left it out because there's no real argument against it besides \"it's gross.\" \n\nBut maybe I'm wrong, who am I", "No, the friend did.

If he'd brought her home, it would have been no different than if he'd taken her to a hotel, or somebody else's house... his wife *still* would have equal reason to be upset. \n\nThat's the part which doesn't apply here. If he took a woman to somewhere that wasn't his home, it would be no less of an offense than if he took a woman to the place that was. But that doesn't apply to the friend, whom one presumes SHOULD be free to pick up a woman for sex and take her to someplace which has nothing to do with the married couple.\n\nThose extra reasons -- in short, the fact that her husband would have been arranging to have sex, himself, with someone who wasn't his wife -- are the *primary* reasons it would matter to most women that their husbands brought home a woman from a bar.

It's completely different if it's his long term gf who's coming over or something. But randomly picking up women in a bar and bringing them into our space, in this case you and your wife's space is a no from me dawg. This ain't no sex crib. It's a home.

So they borrowed your spare room while you were passed out.  This is fairly common in your early to mid 20s.  You weren't involved in any way and he cleaned up afterwards.

The longer you live, the more complex things become, and it's going to become harder and harder to only have people you both know allowed in your home.  I say this as a woman who has been married 30 years with 2 adult children.  Through the years all 4 of us have had many people in our home for a myriad of reasons, often without the other members of the family having met them previously or ever.\n\nIf it's just about the idea of someone in her house having sex besides her, it should be easier to figure out.  While I think it's a little prudish (I mean this as a descriptor, not an insult) to have a problem with this (assuming people change the sheets), it's her house and you should respect that discomfort in the future.  You probably can't keep it from happening (2 adult children here, remember...I am 100% sure there has been sex in my house that didn't include me), but you can promise to not knowingly allow it.  You don't have to agree with her stance to respect it now that it's known.\n\nIf it's about this event feeling shady to her, you really need to understand what that's about.  \nIs she worried you participated?  Or that you wanted to? If so, why is she worried about that?  What reassurance does she need?   \nIs she worried that you used it as live auditory porn?  If so, did you?  If not, reassure her you didn't hear anything and it would have made you uncomfortable if you had.  \nIs she worried that it makes you long for the days of being single, when you could go pick up strangers for sex?  If so, you guys need to talk about that.\n\nI really don't think you did anything wrong, since you didn't know this would upset her, but I do think you will be in the wrong if you don't take her feelings seriously and find out why this was so upsetting for her and how she needs you to handle things in the future.", "[removed]", "We appreciate your sacrifice for a bro", "NTA.
