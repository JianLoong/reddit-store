Personally I'd find that way overbearing, so I think we just fundamentally disagree then. Which is fine. \n\nEither way, I appreciate you adding that context could matter.

If he'd brought her home, it would have been no different than if he'd taken her to a hotel, or somebody else's house... his wife *still* would have equal reason to be upset. \n\nThat's the part which doesn't apply here. If he took a woman to somewhere that wasn't his home, it would be no less of an offense than if he took a woman to the place that was. But that doesn't apply to the friend, whom one presumes SHOULD be free to pick up a woman for sex and take her to someplace which has nothing to do with the married couple.\n\nThose extra reasons -- in short, the fact that her husband would have been arranging to have sex, himself, with someone who wasn't his wife -- are the *primary* reasons it would matter to most women that their husbands brought home a woman from a bar.

The longer you live, the more complex things become, and it's going to become harder and harder to only have people you both know allowed in your home.  I say this as a woman who has been married 30 years with 2 adult children.  Through the years all 4 of us have had many people in our home for a myriad of reasons, often without the other members of the family having met them previously or ever.\n\nIf it's just about the idea of someone in her house having sex besides her, it should be easier to figure out.  While I think it's a little prudish (I mean this as a descriptor, not an insult) to have a problem with this (assuming people change the sheets), it's her house and you should respect that discomfort in the future.  You probably can't keep it from happening (2 adult children here, remember...I am 100% sure there has been sex in my house that didn't include me), but you can promise to not knowingly allow it.  You don't have to agree with her stance to respect it now that it's known.\n\nIf it's about this event feeling shady to her, you really need to understand what that's about.  \nIs she worried you participated?  Or that you wanted to? If so, why is she worried about that?  What reassurance does she need?   \nIs she worried that you used it as live auditory porn?  If so, did you?  If not, reassure her you didn't hear anything and it would have made you uncomfortable if you had.  \nIs she worried that it makes you long for the days of being single, when you could go pick up strangers for sex?  If so, you guys need to talk about that.\n\nI really don't think you did anything wrong, since you didn't know this would upset her, but I do think you will be in the wrong if you don't take her feelings seriously and find out why this was so upsetting for her and how she needs you to handle things in the future.", "[removed]", "We appreciate your sacrifice for a bro", "NTA.

She could have stolen from you or your friend after you guys passed out hell she could\u2019ve, killed you and your friend in your guys sleep; some people are out there man.\n\nBasically you don\u2019t invite a stranger into your house especially when you share the home with someone.\n\nJust apologize and use better judgment next time", "YTA ewww", "NTA - dogs gotta eat", "NTA you played a great wingman for your friend. Cheers mate", "Question: how did she \u201cfind out\u201d? Did you tell her? Or did she have to discover the truth and ask you about it? \n\nI wonder why you didn\u2019t / couldn\u2019t shoot her a text that night and a.) ask her if she was cool with it or b.) let her know what was going on? \n\nI\u2019ve been married a long time and after a night out / away I usually send a \u201chome, love you\u201d or a \u201chome - omg babe guess what happened\u201d text just to check in. I\u2019m not suggesting that everyone has to do this - but bringing your friend (who apparently is terrible with the ladies) and a strange woman home to your house from a night out would definitely classify as news worthy for most couples - even late night. It just seems very fishy that she had to \u201cfind out\u201d when she got home - the next day.\n\nI wonder how this post would read if it was written from your wife\u2019s perspective because my spidey sense is that this is a great cover story - and subsequent Reddit gaslight - to prove that you\u2019re NTA for something that she rightly suspects you truly ATA for. \n\nLet her weigh in?", "I think you're an amazing friend. My wife would give him a high five. Everyone's a stranger the first time. NTA", "Not the AH. That was a very Bro thing to do.", "NAH.\n\nMaybe messaging your wife ahead of time would have helped, but I feel a bit of double standard being applied here. If the husband was out of town, and the wife allows her friend to sleep with a guy in a spare bedroom, would it be as controversial?", "NAH\n\nI get why you did what you did but also get why your wife wouldn\u2019t want a rando over.\nIn the future you now know what\u2019s she comfortable with regarding this kind of situation.", "YTA\n\nBut the reason your an ass isn't the sex in the spare room, it's that you let the stranger in the house overnight.", "I can't get past how comfortable hubby is bringing drunken strangers to his house for sex. Like, it was so smooth, practiced, like him and his buddy do this regularly.\n\nI bet wife can see how one night she's going to find more than one random woman in her house, and not in her guest room. Every time she goes away, hubby goes into Pimp mode. I hope he's getting some hourly rates for the room.", "NTA and you are a fantastic friend", "Nah. You were dumb as a brick, but not an ah", "I can't explain it I feel like most people who are like extremely against it and saying YTA are american or european", "Light YTA. Think you learned the lesson though", "Nta. I've done the same, hubby doesn't care.", "NTA", "NTA.  It was the spare bedroom; I don\u2019t see the big deal.  Had it been in your bed or even on the communal couch that would be entirely different.", "NTA, can't believe all the Y t a's.  You helped a mate out, a good time was had by all.", "Omg reddit- ya\u2019ll are ridiculous. Wife wasn\u2019t even home. Did none of you ever have a hook up? NTA OP", "NTA. Why is he an asshole? This is ridiculous.", "NTA. \n\nIt's your home and you have the right to give your friend your permission to come to your home with his ons/date/hookup. Your wife wasn't in to discuss allowing your best friend use of the spare room and probably wouldn't have appreciated it if you had called her when she was out socialising with her friends.", "That\u2019s where my heads at but also devils advocate i wonder if the wife would have been fine if best friend banged an old friend of hers in the house I.e. someone she does know - op is TA regardless but I wonder where here motivation lies", "I mean if the wife does it all the time. What\u2019s the issue.", "AITA for implying that a question wasn't worth of AITA?", "IKR", "If it were me, I would be pissy about it, but not super mad. It turned out fine, but it seems as though neither of them were awake when this woman left, she could have taken or touched anything. That's what would make me mad, you don't know this person, if she did something, would you even be able to contact her again? You just let her into your home, like she could be nuts.", "This\ud83d\udcaf", "I feel like this reverse card only works if you buy into some kind of gendered double standards.", "I would bet money that the amount of people who would get off on having their best mate have sex with a woman in their spare room is negligible. Porno it is not. Cheating it is not.\n\nHe is the asshole because she was a total stranger, and he just let her in their shared space.", "How would she have carried all that stuff \ud83d\ude02", "I get this and sure, mostly. However, one time, a friend brought a girl back, this girl, peed on the carpet in the corner, drunk, the smell made me sick, and despit trying to clean it, we had to cut a piece of the carpet out. So, sometimes, shit makes you think about these kinds of things in the future. Not as bad as being a serial killer, but the trauma lives on anyway, lol.", "You can invite them to your own house. To someone else\u2019s house, erm. You\u2019re transferring a lot of the risk from yourself onto the host, and that\u2019s a big responsibility.", "I love the absolute garbage fire that happens when someone asks a very minor easy question. \u201cDivorce is the only answer!\u201d \u201cmiscommunication is damnation!\u201d", "Yeah I would be more concerned if he made a post asking if he was wrong after commiting a crime....which oddly enough isn't a uncommon occurrence on this sub.", "exactly.\n\nit's funny how many replies I've received from people arguing otherwise.", "Sorry, I thought you were saying the sex aspect was shady", "One of my brothers literally had his Adderall stolen by a chick that was sleeping with one of his friends in college.  He originally thought it was one of the guys he was staying with, which caused a major falling out, but eventually caught the girl red-handed when she was searching through shit in his room after he had changed the location he had it in. Anyway. Yeah. I can understand why the wife was upset.", "My ex gf had two roommates when we were together, I had to meet both of them before I could stay over because that\u2019s what happens when you live together, you have the common decency to ask the people who live there before you bring some random stranger into their home. This isn\u2019t just about the one night stand, this is about op letting a random, drunk, strange girl into him AND his wife\u2019s home, that\u2019s super messed up", "I think it\u2019s weird. As an adult with a husband- I would be pretty upset to learn my husband was turning our guest room into a hookup spot for his single friend while I was gone.  \n\nIt\u2019s different from a roommate situation if the friend lived there and shared rent- they\u2019re a guest and while I understand the husband wanted to help- he\u2019s not a single guy anymore. He should have 1) asked the wife first or 2) got the friend a hotel room.", "Not necessarily. From the way the story is told, it sounds as if they went there, hung out for a while, had sex, cleaned the bedroom, and she went on her way. I didn't see anything that suggested that they went to sleep. But even so, the lady invited over by the wife to see her art collection could just as easily have stolen the household's possessions while the wife was in the bathroom, or getting something out of the kitchen, or when the guest herself asked to use the bathroom and was directed there instead of walked there and watched the whole way. \n\nThe fact is, we don't usually worry about such things when a member of the household invites a new acquaintance over. The only reason it's on the radar here is that the reason she was invited over was for sex, and there's so much of a link between casual sex and general immorality that it's automatic for too many people to assume that anybody who went over to have sex with somebody must be the kind of person who would steal, assault, blackmail, or commit any other random crime. It makes no logical sense; it's pure prejudice."]}
