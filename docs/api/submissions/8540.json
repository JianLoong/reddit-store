Personally I'd find that way overbearing, so I think we just fundamentally disagree then. Which is fine. \n\nEither way, I appreciate you adding that context could matter.

If he'd brought her home, it would have been no different than if he'd taken her to a hotel, or somebody else's house... his wife *still* would have equal reason to be upset. \n\nThat's the part which doesn't apply here. If he took a woman to somewhere that wasn't his home, it would be no less of an offense than if he took a woman to the place that was. But that doesn't apply to the friend, whom one presumes SHOULD be free to pick up a woman for sex and take her to someplace which has nothing to do with the married couple.\n\nThose extra reasons -- in short, the fact that her husband would have been arranging to have sex, himself, with someone who wasn't his wife -- are the *primary* reasons it would matter to most women that their husbands brought home a woman from a bar.

It's completely different if it's his long term gf who's coming over or something.

The longer you live, the more complex things become, and it's going to become harder and harder to only have people you both know allowed in your home.  I say this as a woman who has been married 30 years with 2 adult children.  Through the years all 4 of us have had many people in our home for a myriad of reasons, often without the other members of the family having met them previously or ever.\n\nIf it's just about the idea of someone in her house having sex besides her, it should be easier to figure out.  While I think it's a little prudish (I mean this as a descriptor, not an insult) to have a problem with this (assuming people change the sheets), it's her house and you should respect that discomfort in the future.  You probably can't keep it from happening (2 adult children here, remember...I am 100% sure there has been sex in my house that didn't include me), but you can promise to not knowingly allow it.  You don't have to agree with her stance to respect it now that it's known.\n\nIf it's about this event feeling shady to her, you really need to understand what that's about.  \nIs she worried you participated?  Or that you wanted to? If so, why is she worried about that?  What reassurance does she need?   \nIs she worried that you used it as live auditory porn?  If so, did you?  If not, reassure her you didn't hear anything and it would have made you uncomfortable if you had.  \nIs she worried that it makes you long for the days of being single, when you could go pick up strangers for sex?  If so, you guys need to talk about that.\n\nI really don't think you did anything wrong, since you didn't know this would upset her, but I do think you will be in the wrong if you don't take her feelings seriously and find out why this was so upsetting for her and how she needs you to handle things in the future.", "[removed]", "We appreciate your sacrifice for a bro", "NTA.

I don't agree about the jewelry getting stolen thing, but the rest is solid. OP's wife doesn't understand because as a married woman, I doubt she has ever had to face the issue of feeling unlovable because nobody of the opposite gender is interested in you. It does a number on mens' mental health and men tend to be supportive of their friends hooking up for this reason. To OPs friend it wasn't \"just a bit of fun\" in exchange for the risk of her possibly stealing stuff; sex carries more weight for OP's friend in that regard. \n\nAs you said, sometimes we need to take risks in life, and let's be real - how often do people actually steal shit from a hookup? It's never happened to me and I've been through a fair amount of similar situations, so personally I would have no issue with it. Are you really going to choose the microscopic mitigation of risk over your close friend with low self-esteem? \n\nIf OP's wife had her way, his friend would 100% be feeling less confident, in return for essentially the same result (nothing got stolen). How is this even a question? Literally everyone came away from the situation perfectly fine, and it's not like OP's wife set some kind of boundary about this (that we know of). It's a shared living space and OP has just as much right to extend it to whoever he wants as his wife has to restrict it. Given OP was the only one home, he assumed all responsibility for the situation and nothing bad happened, in fact very good things happened. \n\nOP should however apologize to his wife for not considering her viewpoint or letting her know about it, and they need to discuss this situation for the future in a way that allows her to feel comfortable without OP having to turn out his close friend. She doesn't get to steamroll this decision. She gets a say in the compromise, but not the final word, that has to be agreed upon, and that's something that cannot be implied. \n\nAlso, to everyone asking why OPs friend didn't just go back to the other person's place: I'm sure he would have given the opportunity, but given he doesn't have a lot of luck with women in general and his low self-esteem, that might've felt like a risky ask to him. I don't know. And frankly I don't care - if my friend needs a secure place to bring a partner for intimacy, I'm going to support him and do what I need to mitigate any risk that might incur. \n\nYou're good OP. Go apologize to your wife and make up, but do so knowing that you're a good friend and that you have agency in this dispute as well.\n\nEdit: NTA btw", "NTA. My wife would\u2019ve been happy to see a guest room go to good use. Maybe it her", "I mean- you're assuming that the wife was worried bc of the possibility that something could have been stolen. But it's not like that. It's about someone entering your private space (your home) without your consent, and the wife's say in this matters just as much as the husband's. \n\nI've lived with roommates and one of them would bring guys over sometimes. Most of the time she wouldn't tell us and yes it made us mad bc we deserve to know who's entering our shared space. Other times they let a friend sleep in my bed while I was away without telling me and I was mad too.

I cannot even fathom why OP would think this is okay. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly immature, IMO.

There are multiple reasons why this is gendered:\n\n- hookups have tangible value, even more-so for men who aren't lucky with women. This is a uniquely male problem because women almost always have options for sex, so it's easy to devalue OPs friends reality. In actuality, this may have been a huge confidence boost to him, and as a male I would gladly support my friend against the microscopic risk that he's bringing home a kleptomaniac. \n\n- assuming the worst in strangers is generally a feminine outlook, because women are conditioned their entire lives to be wary of strangers. Men simply aren't, for a variety of reasons - some good and some bad. But you're assuming OP should naturally have the same outlook on strangers as his wife when in reality, they have each led completely different lives that have made this decision so polarizing and dichotomous. To call OP's life experiences and consequential decisions \"incredibly immature\" based on your own (I assume you're a woman) experiences and invalidating his, is inherently misandrist. \n\nAnd, as you pointed out - they (probably) co-own the space, meaning OP has just as much a right to extend it as OP's wife has to restrict it. Without having established that boundary beforehand, there is no empirical evidence that might suggest OP should naturally have assumed it was a bad idea.

Yes, this woman could have been a thief planning to steal shit. But is that very likely? No, it's fucking not.\n\nIt's not much of a criminal plan to let guys pick you up for casual sex on the off-chance that they'll have easily stolen valuables accessible to you afterward. It's especially dumb to proceed with this plan after learning that you're going to someone else's house, where you have no idea how alert and awake they'll be.\n\nFrankly, there is statistically more risk that this strange woman would end up expected to sleep with both men, whether she wanted to or not, than that she was planning to steal something.

He\u2019s having a stranger in HER guest bedroom, with HER stuff, in a home that he has no claim to.\n\nI\u2019ve had a room mate, in university, and we shared a bedroom. Yes, she would let me know if she was going to have a guy over because it was a shared space, and on Weekends if one of us went home, then it didn\u2019t really matter as much, and we wouldn\u2019t necessarily let each other know. No harm no foul.\n\nHowever, if during a weekend, another friend of mine had stayed over, and SHE\u2019D brought a guy we don\u2019t know home with her, to stay in our room, and I hadn\u2019t cleared that with my room mate, she would have been PISSED.\n\nIt\u2019s bad flat mate etiquette to allow your GUEST, to act like it\u2019s their home.

It is her home as well and it\u2019s disrespectful of him to make that decision to let a stranger into their shared home. \n\nYes the woman was probably fine but we don\u2019t know that. People are capable of stealing etc. I would be crushed to come home and find a bunch of my my stuff stolen cuz my husband let some random stay there, albeit \u201cfor a good cause\u201d\n\nI do get where OP is coming from, I may well have done the same thing if I lived alone.
