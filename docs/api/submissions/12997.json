Her baby was crying, so she asked me to wait while she tried to get her to sleep, so I waited in the living room with Rick, who was doing some kind of remote work. I could see the apartment was a mess but as a person who finds it near impossible to keep a room tidy without a baby, I knew I wasn't in a place to judge. That said, I did want to get on with my day so I was just lingering in the room hoping she'd come back soon. Anna came back after ten minutes, with the baby still crying and said she was going to try feeding her. At this point Rick complained about the noise because he was working. I told Anna I'd be leaving too, but she started asking questions about depositing the money to a bank. I tried to answer her questions but really didn't know all the answers and said she could call her brother and he could tell her what to do.

She said he was sick of the apartment being a mess and that she hadn't showered in two days and that I had to do this for her. I told her once again I was not going to clean her house for her, and she demanded a reason, to which I said I didn't owe her one.

Anna and Rick just exhibited royal A-H entitlement and deserve eviction. It's not enough that they live in your apartment and accept cash handouts, but you're also supposed to do free housekeeping to fix their slovenly ways? Why would you owe that kind of rudeness and demanding behavior and apology?", "NTA.\nThey get free money and a free place to live, and are still entitled! Unfortunately this behaviour has been learned, and by giving them things all the time, they think they can take more and more", "NTA. So not only they insult you, when you brought them money but they also are absolutly blind to the issue? They could appologice, if they don't do - not your problem that they have to move after that. Don't bite the hand that feeds you (for them)", "NTA- Your husband is providing them a place to live rent free, he is giving them money to help with their living situation, what else can they take? I understand it is hard to keep a place spotless and tidy with a baby. But 2 fully functional adults are living in the apartment. Since Rick doesn't have a steady job I'm sure he could find the time to either clean up the place on his own or watch the baby so Anna could do it. He should be capable enough to watch his child while she showers. It's unacceptable that she was demanding you clean her place and help her when she's already getting so much help. Maybe this eviction will wake them up and show them just how easy they had it before. And if his family cares so much why don't some of them volunteer to help Rick and Anna or give them a place to live, since family is family?", "NTA\n\nand I suspect Rick is a real problem. If Anna doesn't have time to shower for two days it probably means her BF refuses to help with child and chores, but expects clean house and home cooked meals. Anna is an adult, but maybe, just maybe, your husband could ask her how this relationship works?", "NTA Anna's bad life choices are NOT your problem. You have your own life to live and things to do that don't include wasting time cleaning their house for free", "NTA. For them to treat you so rudely is ridiculous. You and your husband have done so much already. Especially cleaning the apartment. It's one thing to ask to watch a baby to 10 minutes. It's another to ask to do chores and clean a mess that's not yours.", "You absolutely do NOT owe them any form of an apology. They were 100% out of line. Rick barely works so he should have plenty of time of get things clean. They did this to themselves. Don't think another minute about it.", "NTA\n\nYou can't be your SIL's mom. It isn't your responsibility to clean up after herself.\n\nWhy is it your responsibility that she gets evicted for not cleaning up after herself? What is the point of having Rick there if HE isn't helping with the cleaning?", "NTA You're not a maid. If Rick couldn't be bothered to either take care of the baby or help with the house cleaning then on him and Anna. They have no right to lay their responsibilities on you.", "NTA. Anna was being lazy and trying to get you to do what she and Rick should have already been doing themselves. I get that new babies can make keeping things tidy difficult but that doesn\u2019t mean the responsibility falls on you.", "NTA your husband is going above and beyond for his sister, and the least she can do is treat you both with respect and kindness. You weren't upset the apartment was a mess, you actually seemed to understand. You didn't even seem upset when she asked you to watch the baby. What upset you was when she started demanding you help her and refusing to take no as an answer; and she started calling you names. She dug her own grave. You do not owe an apology, she (and Rick) owe you and your husband one.", "NTA. It was one thing for them to ask, and you were entirely within your rights to refuse. They went over the line when they said you *had* to help them and then began to insult you. \n\nI suspect that if you had said \u201cyes\u201d you would have opened the door to an increasing number of requests that you \u201chad\u201d to do, so it was wise of you to turn them down now, or you would have watched your phone go off continuously. \n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t you who evicted them, it was your husband. And I feel that it wasn\u2019t just over this. It seems like this was a \u201clast straw\u201d situation - your husband has probably been frustrated with them for a long time and what happened to you was just too much for him.", "NTA. Why couldn't Rick do it if he was sick of the mess? They brought this on themselves by being rude and entitled.", "NTA, your husband is right.  Anna and her husband are the gold digging duo.  Your husband is subsidizing them, she doesn't work, he's working from home thererfore they should be able to deal with their home and family.  To treat you so rudely while expecting some over the top favors is beyond entitled and ridiculous.  If the family feels differently, let them be the ones to go over to clean, provide child care and whatever else they desire.", "NTA. Don\u2019t you dare apologise then you will condone their behaviour. You said you barely know Anna so why would you help her, it is Anna and Rick\u2019s responsibility to clean their apartment  not yours! So entitled.", "There is a reason I dont talk to anyone in my family...my family and your family should get together and go bowling....NTA.", "Nta not your pig not your farm.", "Definitely nta \nIt's not your job or place to clean up after someone else, unless you are specifically hired for that job", "NTA. You owe them nothing. Rick couldn\u2019t watch the baby for 10 min while she showered because she hasn\u2019t been able to shower in TWO DAYS???? Wtf is he doing to help her? And for her to involve the whole family is rich, if she really needed help she can ask her family. Either they can keep their noses out of it or they help her if she\u2019s struggling.", "NTA  \n1. There's obviously some bad feeling from Anna before this started  \n2. You're not obligated to help  \n3. You don't owe her one.  \n4. Your husband over reacted here not you, based on facts as presented   \n5. They created the mess and your husband made it worse", "NTA. They weren't wrong to ask for help, but you weren't wrong to refuse. They went and bit the hand that fed them and now they're paying the price.", "No verdict:  But my opinion I could imagine hearing my sister in law saying she hasn't shower in 2 days and just need an hour or 2 to watch the baby as she cleaned and showered I would. \n\nThat's just me.", "NTA.... she  have time to shower when the baby is sleeping  and to clean...

I get it, you're supporting them a ton, so this may have come off like they're ungrateful. I don't think that is what the intention was, though. I see an overwhelmed new mom who needed a break, and a partner who was working and not able to drop what he was doing, which is also valid. \n\nIf you didn't have anything else to do or somewhere else to be, it would've been an incredibly kind and empathetic gesture to offer to watch the baby for 20 minutes while she showered. If you did have somewhere else to be, I would've offered to come by another time and watch the baby for 30-60 minutes so that mom could get some stuff done. It doesn't sound like they have the financial means to get a lot of outside help, and you're family. \n\nI agree that the comment about you helping tidy things up was the wrong was to ask for help, and I get why you reacted poorly to the way that was phrased. I think the way she reacted and the things she said to you were unkind and uncalled for, but I'm also sure that they came from a place of stress and exhaustion. You deserve an apology for that.\n\nHowever, you've just made their life 100 times more difficult by evicting them, which to me personally seems like a way overblown response to this argument. There was a way to cool off and explain your perspective to them at a later time, and it sounds like your husband went straight to punishing them in a way that is really serious and life-altering. The level of reaction on both sides likely permanently damaged a family relationship, which is unfortunate.\n\nMy advice, for whatever it's worth, is to have a conversation with them and say that you think you're owed an apology for the unkind things that they said, and that if they apologize you'll rescind the eviction.", "Nta for not helping clean. \n\nBut yta for escalating it to get them evicted.", "[deleted]", "ESH - you dropping by unannounced apparently in the middle of the day, seeing someone obviously struggling and just standing around all judgy. They acted entitled and obviously offensive trying to goad you into helping them, expressing resentment.

In that moment it sounds like both Rick and Anna were overwhelmed by everything but Anna states that Rick is tired of the apartment being a mess but doesn\u2019t seem like he does anything about it but complain.

This isn't OP's problem to solve but damn, if something sinister isn't going on in this relationship I'll eat my hat.", "Yeah, but she wanted OP to clean the apartment, not her.  Asking to watch the baby so she can take a shower is ok, but it\u2019s ok for OP to say no as well.  To have an attitude about her saying no to watching the baby AND clean the place for her?

Maybe her husband over-reacting but OP is in no ways the AH. Everyone goes thru stressful times, it doesn\u2019t mean you have the right to pawn your stress on to another person to alleviate your own situation.

Seems he did that on his own.", "She didn't escalate. She told her HUSBAND what was happening. Of course she told her husband what his sister said to her. The husband is the one who is evicting her. And no one is OWED help. There is absolutely ZERO reason why SIL could not have asked for help and coordinated that with OP or her brother or anyone else. You don't just expect people who are GIVING YOU MONEY to also spend their time at the drop of a hat babysitting and cleaning someone else's mess. Im sure 95% of us here would LOVE for someone to just come watch our kids and clean our messes while we shower. We all make do.

In 2023 can we PLEASE stop telling people they need to help simply because it's family. She started insulting her and called her a gold digger. Would you have stayed and helped the people insulting you for not cleaning THEIR house and taking care of THEIR kid?? Listen parenting is hard. Worse when the baby is young. But every parent has the moment where they figure out their groove. It's not on OP to be that groove and people like Anna and Rick are why no one wants to be a village anymore. It's not mandatory to help when you don't want to so stop trying to guilt someone into viewing shit the way you do.", "Why is it op responsible to help out someone she doesn\u2019t really know just because its her husband sibling?", "Same", "That's actually fault I mis read that she asked to watch the baby as she shower and clean. \n\nBut idk maybe it's because my sister is currently pregnant I'm thinking I would have just helped i see her distressed. \n\nShe's not an AH it's just one of those situations I would have helped", "It sounds like you've already made up your mind on this.

If you're genuinely concerned that they will be bad tenants after this, wait and find that out. It feels like you're looking for a reason to evict them by making those kind of excuses. If they ended up being bad tenants, then you'd have a stronger reason for kicking them to the curb, but you didn't wait to find that out.", "idk, if my sister-in-law asked me to watch my niece/nephew for half an hour so that I could shower, I'd do it or offer to do it another time.

Every parent has a messy house and lacks a shower and needs some sleep and fights with their partner. Anna needs to learn.", "Thats because its your sister. This op husband sister who she doesnt really know. There no connection there like siblings. Anna assumed because she with her brother that she should help even more. Than coming to drop money off.", "How is she part of the problem in any way?? She was already doing them a favor by dropping them cash and the eviction was the husband's decision.

Why should she help when she already have stuff to do herself? Just because they are family. If sil needed help then ask for it and schedule for a person to help. Not try to force it on someone who coming to drop money off for you.", "Oh I just feel I would do the same for a sister and law too but I do admit I could because I just found out I'm going to be an uncle 2 weeks ago so weak spot for babies at the moment lol", "Sure, if you have an existing negative relationship with that person, that definitely changes things. Based on OP's comment to me, it doesn't seem like that was the case, so in the absence of a negative relationship, I would've done the other human being a solid if I had the time. Taking even the family out of it, it's someone you know who was clearly struggling.\n\nThis is just my opinion. I come from a big community and family where we all do things like this for each other, regardless of how well we know one another, so I can see how that could impact my perspective. I naturally have a lot of empathy for the struggles of new parenthood.", "NTA. \n\nOf i read this right they are living rent free in your apartment, they are getting money from your husband, which means it is your joint money, and they calles you a gold digger because while dropping off your money to them in your apartment they are living in for free, you refused to clean up their mess ? \n\nAnd your being blamed because your husband took a stand? Did you tell him to kick them out? His whole family sounds like a nightmare. Also sounds like sponges that have been using your husband as a means to live in a style they don't really deserve.\n\nThey need to learn this lesson really.

Desperate people do desperate things, but desperation also breeds danger, and OP doesn't need to risk that for herself. And she did tell her husband what happened.

Also your husband has the right to decide to evict them. \n\nSo, not even remotely AH.", "Nope you owe them nothing. She had a lil one with an ASSHAT....and is in over her  head. Bad situation.... but you aren't a nanny or a maid. NTA.", "NTA, op. You'll always look like an AH for those who have the sheer audacity to overreach and expect you'll comply, because. You ask someone you *barely* know to clean your house, because? How does that remotely make sense? \n\nThe premise that you somehow you being a non AH / good human is tied to free Merry Maid services is divorced from reality and realistic healthy expectations. \n\nINFO: If the issue of cleaning was that serious, why not politely approach landlord brother who's already DIRECTLY SUBSIDIZING YOU to get cleaning assistance? Or is OP the AH because she's a woman and didn't rush to help out with the familial duties expected by gender norms? \n\nI'm a remote worker, too. SIL can also get the man she married off his rear to help her, ffs. In 24 hours, I'm sure he can find (conservatively) two to help around the house. \n\nThen the cherry: the nerve to disparage you for having the gall to have better things to than be free house help to a married couple. \n\nI'm happy your husband is no longer enabling them, at minimum.", "I love how the family always condemns but doesn\u2019t help either.", "NTA - because of their sense of entitlement and the comments they made to you. If I dropped anything off for a friend or family with a baby and they asked for help long enough to have a shower, I\u2019d definitely take time to accommodate that, even if I had other errands to run. It sounds like her husband sucks and she was just trying to get some help and went about it the wrong way (possibly out of exhaustion).", "NTA at all but why did your husband evict them?", "Sooo they decided to bite the hand that feeds them and are now mad about the outcome? Wow.\n\nNTA.", ">Anna then followed me to the door and asked if I would mind watching the baby while she showered and maybe tidying up her house a little bit. At first I thought she was joking but Anna said she was indeed serious, she could use the help. I told her I\n\nAnna was asking OP to watch the baby so Anna could shower and clean. I think she's trapped in a shit situation and OP SHOULD spend some time with her so she has an ally in the future.", "They have a 9 month old. Not a newborn. At 9 months babies are easily less work, and on top of that, they take naps. There is zero excuse for her not to shower. Cleaning is tough and I struggle with prioritizing and following through with it too. So I\u2019m not here to judge that part. \n\nBut I have two kids under 5 that I am home most days with alone. I can at the very least shower and tidy up in between someone needing something. Her excuses are greatly exaggerated and what she expected of OP is ridiculous. Sure. She can ask about OP helping. But the way she followed through on it was insane.  For the most part, people don\u2019t mind helping others, especially financially, when it\u2019s at least being appreciated.  This situation had zero appreciation and 100% entitlement.", "How could you dare imply personal responsibility?! *shocked gasp* I'm appalled!\n\n\n/s", "Yeah his reactive is very extreme but maybe there is more to the story as far as husband and sisters relationship. I still feel bad SIL obviously needs help and the family seems to be mad at OP for not helping but no one else seems to be either.. being a new mom is hard and being one with a shitty is even harder", "This was the entitled parent post I was looking for \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "INFO - why doesn't he know his sister well if they're only a year apart? I could understand a huge age difference, but they're almost twins. Was there a falling out?", "Exactly,  And I cannot even imagine asking my landlord to \"clean\" for me.  And technically OP is the landlady <<*lives an apartment my husband gifted me*\\>>", "I suffered from a few of these and while I would be upset if someone denied me help, people also can say no. I do feel bad for the SIL but I wouldn\u2019t help and stay if I felt uncomfortable around people or at someone\u2019s house. SIL sounds close enough to her mom and other family maybe she should ask for help from them? People don\u2019t have to offer help if they aren\u2019t comfortable doing it.

It is an unpaid job, agreed.  \n\nBut as she appears to be(by virtue of relationship) providing the \"rent\" which since they struggle financially with Rick's <<some on/off jobs>> to the point that the brother has to provide additional funds.  So you can bet that Rick is not providing 50% or more towards the household expenses. \n\n(PS she's an A-H here too for expecting OP to clean for her and for calling her a gold digger)", "I can see your point, thanks for responding.\n\nI do recall babysitting for my niece when she could talk yet, and trying to entertain her and interpreting every little sound left me feeling like the inside of my skull had been attacked with sandpaper, and that's with one preprepared meal and one diaper change...\nI'd forgotten about that, so thanks for clarifying!", "I agree. Baby to the bathroom.  Shower..5-7 mins..tomorrow......then file for divorce.", "My husband NEVER  EVER  hedged about  the babies. They were his as well. He cooked,  Cleaned, bathed and helped with feeding...all of it. 2 of the 3 had terrible colic....it was hell till  7 months or so.  He never wavered. And he worked 60hrs a week, and in army reserves as well", "I agree that they\u2019re both assholes. I was more referring to the comments insinuating that he should have dropped everything in that moment to help her so that OP didn\u2019t have to. \n\nOutside of work hours he absolutely needs to be helping her probably much more than he is (making an assumption) but during work hours if he\u2019s working from home he might as well not be there.", "NTA, but you and your husband need to talk to Anna about getting away from Rick. he\u2019s bad news, 100%", "NTA, it was your choice and your right to say no.  However, you could have bothered to show a little compassion and offered to hold the baby while she took a shower or spent a few minutes cleaning. I agree, it's definitely not your responsibility but at the same time you could have spared a few extra minutes to help an overwhelmed and struggling mother. They treated you horribly, though, and their responses were absolutely uncalled for. It's definitely hard to show compassion for someone who demands it like they have a right to it.", "NTA", "NTA you don\u2019t owe anyone an apology. Anna and Rick are off their rockers. You are not their servant. Let\u2019s say you did watch the baby and cleaned up. What the heck are they going to demand next?

At this point I was thinking \u201cHrm. The OP just doesn\u2019t get it\u201d but then \u2026 I remembered Rick sitting there Working. He could help after his work hours, and let his wife shower and tidy the house. This is how everyone does it, so the fact that isn\u2019t happening shows there\u2019s \u201cissues\u201d at play.  The OP seems clueless about how hard small humans can be, and a bit \u2026 unpleasant, but I assume the OP has never had kids. (if the OP HAS had children, then the OP is an AH)\n\n  \nBut then Anna doubled down calling the OP names and set fire to her own gravy train.   \n\n\nLeave it to his family to sort out. Don\u2019t get involved. Say \u201cThis is my husband\u2019s decision please work with him on it\u201d. He is clearly putting a line in the sand about how you will be treated by the family, and they think badgering you might change it. He knows his family\u2019s flavour of dysfunction best, leave it to him.", "OP, how could you possibly be the asshole for refusing to let these jealous, vicious and entitled people take advantage of you? NTA. As people on reddit love to say, they fucked around and found out. I'm glad your husband has your back. Everyone in the family taking their side can deal with their nonsense instead.", "NTA. They see you as a landlord and not family.  I work in commercial real estate and the sheer entitlement residents get when not following the terms of their lease astounds me.", "NTA. Rick is a total loser who doesn\u2019t help his wife and she is struggling. And bc she can\u2019t hold him accountable, she became entitled and tried to force your hand. You don\u2019t owe them anything.", "NTA.  Yes it is hard with a 9 month old but you and your husband are already giving them a place to live.  She can take a quick shower while the baby sleeps.  If they say it only takes 10 minutes he can take his lunch break and watch the baby. IF the family feels you are being unreasonable let them help.", "NTA. I agree with everyone who says there is something off about the Rick and Anna dynamic. \n\nHe\u2019s probably the sort of person who complains about babysitting his kids.  And that all domestic tasks it\u2019s the woman\u2019s job. Cool, clean and childcare. \n\nI feel like maybe your in laws need to get together and discuss with Anna that you Guys will support her once she leaves him. That y\u2019all love her and are more than happy to help her onto her feet and perhaps offer therapy for her so she can recognize how abusive her relationship is with the BF. Maybe not physically abusive but neglectful and emotionally abusive at least. Get her signed up for social welfare programs to help her. Maybe have her attend vocational training programs once the baby is older?", "Totally agree. You should definitely have your husband talk to his sister (privately) about Rick.

Bet they sure want to seek support from us now, huh?\n\nYou offer no empathy, no solution, no suggestions, no kind education. Community outreach/education? Trauma Informed Care? You are placing blame on Op when we have no clear-cut proof on there being abuse. Professional insight, sure. But that's not fact.\nIt's not like SIL was in the midst of being beaten, and OP turned her back on her. This isn't OP's fault. \n\nYou should have some sort of pride in OP for having survived an abusive childhood and being able to set and keep her boundaries. You should know how difficult that is for survivors, and isn't that something we DV workers celebrate with clients? How do you know being screamed and swore at, or even in a room with that kind of tension and dynamic, wouldn't trigger a C-PTSD response or some other anxiety/dissociation response that could be dangerous for OP? Panic attack, flashbacks, S ideation, Self H? \n\nI seriously hope that you don't berate clients and their families this way. Plenty of non-professionals here have offered OP perspective in an educational and gentle way. Do more training, take a break, or switch specialties if you're so burnt out that you're acting like this. It's not helping anyone."]}
