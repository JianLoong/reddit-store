My ex-husband ( 33M) tried to baby trap me (we agreed on no kids until 30, I was 26 at the time), and my fiance\u2019s ex-wife (24F) cheated on him. We actually met in the parking lot of the court house where he was going to file for his divorce two years ago. These events happened within the first year of our respective marriages, which has led to an admittedly strange decision on our part for our upcoming wedding.\n\nWeddings are typically very expensive ventures. My ex and I spent a LOT of money on my first wedding (I thought it would be my only wedding and my most special day, so we went all out), and fiance spent a fair chunk on his and shouldered a majority of the financial burden of it since his ex didn\u2019t make very much at the time. We have decided to cut out all of the expenses of a reception for our wedding and simply have a nice ceremony at a more low-key venue and save the party for our anniversary. It will also give us more time to save for those expenses, and we\u2019d both feel much better about having this celebration after we hit that one-year milestone.\n\nAlso, the wedding ceremony is being held in lovely church in the downtown area, so it\u2019s not out of the question for all of us or some of us to go to dinner/a bar/etc afterwards. Even if many of us don\u2019t go as a group, guests have over a dozen options in walking distance.\n\nWe didn\u2019t think this would be a big issue, but when we shared it at a family dinner (us, our siblings, all of our parents) we got immediate pushback. Thoughts and opinions ranging from it being selfish to disrespectful to oxymoronic to choose to have the wedding and not the reception. They all think we HAVE to have the reception, and my mom is especially disappointed that I already didn\u2019t have an engagement party, and my fiance\u2019s brothers are upset he isn\u2019t having a stag night.\n\nWe just want to have a simple, nice wedding, and that be that for the time being. I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s such a bad idea. We\u2019ve been getting calls and texts as the word spreads to various family members, all of whom are mad or disappointed in regards to our decision. Are we being assholes?\n\nEdit: Left this out somehow but the ceremony is only for close family. And potentially close friends (we\u2019ve agreed to each invite a max of 20 people).\n\nEdit: After reading all the comments and talking to my fiance, we\u2019ve decided on eloping. We don\u2019t want to alienate our family from celebrating our marriage, but it\u2019s clear that they and many other people think weddings are more about the guests than the couple getting married. It\u2019s going to cause an even bigger fuss probably, but I\u2019m not marrying my fiance for other people. I\u2019m marrying him because I love him and I want to.

At most of the weddings I had been to before, there was a gap between the ceremony and the reception, to allow time for the couple and bridal party to do their photos. Since we had a lot of out-of-town guests coming who would have nowhere to go during this time, we were trying to figure out a way to shorten this gap.\n\nWe were originally having the reception start at 6. So I suggested to my parents that we have the reception start at 5, while the groom and I were still taking photos, and that the two of us would join the reception at 6. For some reason, this made my dad **really** angry. Since my parents were paying for the reception, they had a say in how things went, and I totally understood that. What I didn't understand was why my dad got so suddenly angry about the whole thing. We could have had a calm conversation where he said, \"No, I really think it should stay at 6pm\" but for some reason he was ranting and raving for about 10 minutes. (Included among his arguments was the fact that the word \"reception\" was related to the word \"receive\" and therefore the two of us had to be there to \"receive\" the guests.) Eventually I just tuned out, and sat there waiting for him to stop yelling, and then I said, \"Fine, the reception will stay at 6.\" Almost 20 years later, I still have no idea what that was all about.", "NTA - gods, i wish more people thought like you!

It was just a giant rectangle but man, google spring fling cake, that's so yummy.\n\n(and for people who are going to be mean - we're not poor. We just don't feel like spending much on things we don't care about)", "NTA. Just elope. You're gonna piss off some family members whether you go big or not.", "Omg. How was eloping not the first thought? Why would it be acceptable to invite people to something and not be a host in any capacity? You just wanted them to show up and watch you do something super intimate\u2026and not even get a glass of wine after? \n\nAnd then the edit\u2026wild. This is the perfect intersection of selfish and self-centered. Save you money, get everyone to pay attention to you, and send them on their way. Just a wild concept. Ofc you should elope and it sounds like you\u2019ll be happier for it. \n\nBtw, you don\u2019t have to have a party later on either, if you don\u2019t want to genuinely celebrate it with people. Why do it out of obligation? YTA through and through.", "My husband and I got married at the Zoo in front of the flamingos. He had a gig at the restaurant, we all purchased our own meals , drinks, we provided a cake. He played his drums, and got paid, \ud83d\ude02. Marriage is about you and your husband. They want a reception, let them pay for it. Best wishes and congratulations on your up coming nuptials", "I got married on my property with a total of 5 other people present including the photographer and officiant. We went on a hike and had a homemade dinner after. Who really cares what other people think? As long as you\u2019re married at the end of the day and you\u2019re happy with it, then all is well. Congrats on the upcoming wedding! NTA", "NTA.\n\nLove the update.", "My husband and I got married in our living room with a hand full of people. He was previously married and I just wanted a house instead of a big wedding. We got engaged then 2 months later Covid hit. We purchased a house. Then decide to use Covid as our excuse to have a tiny wedding. We spent maybe a thousand, Justice of the peace, food, drinks, and a photographer. Best wedding ever.", "Do you realize you can have a cheap reception? No decorations, flower arrangements, dancing, blah, blah, blah.\n\nRent a city rec facility, KC hall, or senior center. With 40 guests you'd only need one, at most two, hired hands to up set up tables and a buffet from a local restaurant or grocery store catering. I know I could do it for under $20/person in food. Another $300 for the staff. $200 for the rental. \n\nThe food needs to only be sufficient to curb hunger. The facility is too provide a place for your guests to mingle.\n\nYTA if you want price to come to your ceremony but have no set plan for socializing with the guests afterwards.", "YTA\n\nYou just can\u2019t have a ceremony and no reception. It is incredibly selfish. \n\nYour edit makes it clear that you aren\u2019t thinking of anyone but yourself. If you are expecting gifts, or hell even for people to just take the time out of their lives to attend, you should reciprocate.\n\nIt\u2019s not a choice of a 50k reception or no reception. Especially if there\u2019s only 30 people, you can do a restaurant or a park or a church hall for 1-5k.\n\nFine, elope, that\u2019s not a problem. But don\u2019t act all pissy like your family made you do it because otherwise they\u2019d call you out on your rudeness.", "NTA, it's your wedding but good for you on doing the elopement rather than a ceremony.  It will save you money in the long run.", "I saw toueedit, congratulations.  My husband and I eloped in Las Vegas. One of the best decisions I made in my life.", "NTA if everyone knows there\u2019s no reception. \n\nHowever, you wouldn\u2019t get my RSVP. Weddings are boring. Ceremonies make it a little less sucky.", "Reading after Edit put in. OP- Just what I was going to suggest. Elope, enjoy the ceremony between the two of you. Concentrate on the Marriage, not the trappings. Congratulations, blessings on your upcoming Nuptials! NTA", "NTA it's your wedding\n\nBut I gotta say I've been to some really low cost receptions that were like bare bones.\n\nLike basic chairs/tables. A phone hooked up to 1 speaker and a bunch of pizza and some drinks (charge cost for drinks) It was just as fun as a super expensive one.\n\nThey rented a small hall just outside the city so it cost less.", "NTA but if they keep acting this way just elope and get married how you want too.", "Right? Their guests not provided dinner after this wedding, then they invite same people to another event, they're already bad hosts, why would anyone go?", "I\u2019m ALL for doing what you can afford - so I\u2019m camp NTA.\n\nI will add that I have been to several cake only receptions.  Where you go downstairs to the fellowship hall at the church and have cake, maybe some punch or lemonade and iced tea.  Wish the couple well and be on with your day.\n\nCake receptions work well because they are not that expensive (sheet cake can be ordered from a grocery store) so long as it I made clear that it is a cake reception and is at an appropriate time and not over a meal.", "Wow! You have to provide dinner to all your guests, not just a select few.", "Oh I missed that, thanks!", "If not a meal, at least tea and sweets or something. The idea of having people come in,\nAnd you\u2019ll get dressed up for just a half hour ceremony is very weird to me. I mean NTA because your wedding is your party but I also would definitely complain about this setup to my husband on the car ride home.", "I think it\u2019s crazy that everyone expects to be fed. You don\u2019t expect to be fed if you attend a courthouse wedding. This is the religious version of that with 20 or less guests invited. I find it really tacky that guests are demanding a reception \u2014 just don\u2019t come if you aren\u2019t interested enough in witnessing the ceremony by itself. And obviously gifts should not be expected in this situation.", "You do when you invite them to an event.", "Hmm, ok. I apparently didn't take cultural differences into account.", "This sounds fun!", "I'm in the south(well depending on who you ask, Texas to some is or isnt). \nGot invited to a wedding which the bride knew was an hour plus drive for many people, including myself. Only a ceremony happened. All we got was cake and water-maybe a juice- right after the newlyweds were done taking pics (which of course meant we were just waiting around AS IF a reception was happening in that same venue because they didnt announce or put on invites that it was just the ceremony). Suffice to say I was upset I dressed up for such a short bland event AND to something where lots of people dressed super casually.\nIf we had gotten the heads up there would be no reception, food or drinks(wasn't expecting alcohol because of the couples beliefs, i just mean more than water) I would've dressed down and might not have bothered going. We stopped at a Buc-ees on the way home.", "It depends if they\u2019re sending out specific invitations. In my experience, if you specifically invite someone to an event then you\u2019re expected to do some sort of refreshments (even just coffee and donuts). However, I\u2019ve known people to say \u201cHey fyi we\u2019re doing this on x date, we\u2019re not doing specific invitations but people who want to attend are welcome \u2014 we just don\u2019t want to invite people when we\u2019re not holding any sort of celebration!\u201d Once you specifically invite someone or give them a role, there\u2019s more pressure to attend, so some sort of hospitality is warranted.", "A great way to mitigate that would just be to reserve a place for 42 people and have dinner be the reception?", "Well the legality does line up. I personally think people should be able to drink at 18, but hey, I didn't write the law.", "Honestly. She was an adult, she consented, she knew what she was doing. If she realized marrying young was a mistake, she had all the right in the world to divorce instead of cheat.", "You know, I\u2019m starting to to understand her affair the more you describe their relationship.", "The idea of brain development ending at 25 is incorrect: https://slate.com/technology/2022/11/brain-development-25-year-old-mature-myth.html"]}
