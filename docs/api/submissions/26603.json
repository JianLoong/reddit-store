We actually met in the parking lot of the court house where he was going to file for his divorce two years ago. These events happened within the first year of our respective marriages, which has led to an admittedly strange decision on our part for our upcoming wedding.\n\nWeddings are typically very expensive ventures. My ex and I spent a LOT of money on my first wedding (I thought it would be my only wedding and my most special day, so we went all out), and fiance spent a fair chunk on his and shouldered a majority of the financial burden of it since his ex didn\u2019t make very much at the time. We have decided to cut out all of the expenses of a reception for our wedding and simply have a nice ceremony at a more low-key venue and save the party for our anniversary. It will also give us more time to save for those expenses, and we\u2019d both feel much better about having this celebration after we hit that one-year milestone.\n\nAlso, the wedding ceremony is being held in lovely church in the downtown area, so it\u2019s not out of the question for all of us or some of us to go to dinner/a bar/etc afterwards. Even if many of us don\u2019t go as a group, guests have over a dozen options in walking distance.\n\nWe didn\u2019t think this would be a big issue, but when we shared it at a family dinner (us, our siblings, all of our parents) we got immediate pushback. Thoughts and opinions ranging from it being selfish to disrespectful to oxymoronic to choose to have the wedding and not the reception. They all think we HAVE to have the reception, and my mom is especially disappointed that I already didn\u2019t have an engagement party, and my fiance\u2019s brothers are upset he isn\u2019t having a stag night.\n\nWe just want to have a simple, nice wedding, and that be that for the time being.

Two and a half years into the marriage, they are fighting over who gets custody of the wedding debt in the divorce settlement.  As you might guess, no one wants custody of the wedding debt.

Stand your ground.", "NTA. There's just something about weddings that makes people lose their minds. In the early 2000s I got married to my now-ex husband. At most of the weddings I had been to before, there was a gap between the ceremony and the reception, to allow time for the couple and bridal party to do their photos. Since we had a lot of out-of-town guests coming who would have nowhere to go during this time, we were trying to figure out a way to shorten this gap.\n\nWe were originally having the reception start at 6. So I suggested to my parents that we have the reception start at 5, while the groom and I were still taking photos, and that the two of us would join the reception at 6. For some reason, this made my dad **really** angry. Since my parents were paying for the reception, they had a say in how things went, and I totally understood that. What I didn't understand was why my dad got so suddenly angry about the whole thing. We could have had a calm conversation where he said, \"No, I really think it should stay at 6pm\" but for some reason he was ranting and raving for about 10 minutes. (Included among his arguments was the fact that the word \"reception\" was related to the word \"receive\" and therefore the two of us had to be there to \"receive\" the guests.) Eventually I just tuned out, and sat there waiting for him to stop yelling, and then I said, \"Fine, the reception will stay at 6.\" Almost 20 years later, I still have no idea what that was all about.", "NTA - gods, i wish more people thought like you!

That's a perfectly sensible decision. Family doesn't get to have a party at your expense, just because you're getting married. A low-key ceremony is fine.\n\nThis is assuming that anyone invited is local. If you're asking people to travel to this, then you owe them more hospitality, IMO.", "With all that going on my sole suggestion is to elope and let them all know on your return.

That's how I did my wedding, reception office for me, husband and parents only, then to our favourite mexican restaurant. No regrets.", "NTA.

It's your wedding, so it's your choice. This makes sense since it's a smaller, more intimate event with close family.

Several family members were furious that we didn't have the big wedding and reception. It was a second marriage for both of us, and we just didn't have much to spend.  We used what we had for a very short honeymoon. They said that they needed to be able to toast us with champagne. When asked if they were paying for it, they got really quiet.", "One of my good friends did something very similar. Lovely wedding in the park with just close family and friends, dinner afterwards at a restaurant a couple of blocks away. Hands down, the least stressful wedding I've ever stood up in.

She tried to flirt with him to get her way, and it didn\u2019t work, but they did end up flirting a few more times and slept together, and it escalated from there. He actually mixed and poured her first legal drink and it was the signature cocktail at their wedding. \n\nHe started to develop a drinking problem though, so he doesn\u2019t drink or bartend anymore. Works fine for me because I never really enjoyed the taste of alcohol. We\u2019ll have champagne available at the anniversary party/reception, but the two of us are going to toast with sparkling grape juice and have mostly otherwise non-alcoholic options including fun mocktails.
