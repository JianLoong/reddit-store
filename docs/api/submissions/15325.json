How insulting to neurodiverse folk.\n\nShe is a stalker and is sexually harassing you. You\u2019ve tried to get help at every turn and have only been met with dead ends. No wonder you hit a boiling point and got angry. Keep records of whatever she sends you and *keep going to administration* and your parents, and ask if anyone can get in touch with her parents. This behavior is unacceptable. You deserve to feel safe in your school.", "NTA- As another autistic girl, what in the actual fuck. \n\nTalk to the school administration. They may be able to settle things for you.", "NTA, get your parents and the school administration involved to help you.", "NTA. I'm sorry you're going through this OP. You don't need to be nice and you don't owe the girl an explanation. \n\nThis is disgusting behavior and basically stalking. Was telling her she is disgustingly ugly, stupid, repulsive, and a creep constructive? No. Was it fair after getting months of harassment, stalking, and creeping? Yes. \n\nJust because someone is neurodivergent doesn't excuse stalking behavior or unwanted advances. Let alone getting included in erotic content that's posted on social media.\n\nI think I'm questioning why her parents haven't talked about the behavior.", "NTA. I am neurodivergent and would never engage in that kind of behavior. Your friend is making excuses for her. This girl CAN stop doing this if she wants to--she simply doesn't want to. Your friend may run the neurodivergence alliance club, but she doesn't seem to really know what she's talking about.", "NTA. You guys should make ALL of the noise about this. Something similar happened to my sibling and the school was able to make sure they had zero classes together and the stalker was warned that there would be automatic expulsion if they tried to communicate in any way with my sibling.\n\nThis also seems extremely illegal? She\u2019s sending sexual content to a minor, harassing you, and contacting you after being repeatedly asked to stop. She\u2019s getting close to you\u2014if she\u2019s touching you, that\u2019s assault. She\u2019s like very much in legal action territory and the school is very much in liability territory for not protecting you. (Editing to add that I say this as someone with no legal background at all but I can\u2019t imagine this is ok?!!!) If you guys can afford a lawyer to even just scare the shit out of the school, that could get the ball rolling but it\u2019s disgusting that it\u2019s gotten this far.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t blame you for lashing out but unfortunately interacting with a stalker (even negatively) reinforces them reaching out. If she knows she can get a response by making fake accounts and sending disturbing things to you, she will keep doing it. It\u2019s so hard and unfair but do your best to ignore her completely. I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this.", "NTA- I understand why your friend is upset, but clearly they don\u2019t understand.  God forbid she\u2019s ever stalked as it is one of the worst experiences imaginable.  Your friend doesn\u2019t understand the frustration that lead you to write what you did, try to explain it.  Yeah, you could have probably worded something better, but also - what the actual fuck, your stalker probably needs some counseling at the minimum\u2026.", "NTA, take it up to the district administrator and superintendent. Continue to make police reports every single time. This IS very concerning.", "NTA. Flip genders and think about how it would look. A guy following around a girl writing erotic things about her, etc. You may need to keep pushing with the school and contact a lawyer if they do nothing.", "Ah double standards\u2026 if the gender were reversed, people wouldn\u2019t react that way and take you seriously. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nI would talk to the guidance counselor to try to get her as far away as possible.", "NTA. This response was after months of being stalked, harassed, and sexually harassed.

I\u2019m sorry the school is failing you. File a second report with the police, then see if you can get your parents to threaten to sue the school over sexual harassment.", "NTA. Is your friend neurodivergent? If not they need to do some reading about the subject. If so ask her why they don't stalk and sexually harass people like her?  It's also past time to talk to parents and a lawyer.", "NTA.   \nYou so-called friend is enabling your stalkers abuse.", ">I (M17) have been followed around by this girl (F16) at my school for the past five months.

She walks uncomfortably close to me despite me telling her to stop and go away, follows me around school sometimes recording me and even came on my bus multiple times even though she isn\u2019t on my route.\n\nOk, speaking as a neurodivergent male, not the asshole. At some point, no matter what is said, the actions are justified by the breach of boundaries. I grasp that in spite of being diagnosed with ASD. Boundaries aren't beyond a neurodivergent individuals capability of grasping, certainly not one attending mainstream classes, and if they are it's because people like your friend are coddling her.\n\nEverything you described in that paragraph, and what followed, was wildly inappropriate. You've told her to stay away, but she is actively stalking you and making up sexually inappropriate material **which she is making public.**\n\nWhat's more you didn't even say this publicly. She breached a boundary again, and you said this to her privately. She suffered no humiliation, just the rejection she earned.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You need to get your parents and the school involved.", "Nta, but you probably could have left out the remarks about her looks. Yes, neurodivergent people do have a harder time understanding boundaries, however, they CAN understand them. The one thing you haven't said you've done is speak to her parents. You need to go to her parents and tell them what is going on. They will know the best way to get her to understand she needs to stop and leave you alone.", "NTA. I don't think this is anyone's fault but the school's and higher ups.", "NTA - harsh, actually very harsh, but she was stalking you and making you feel unsafe. You did what you had to do to get her to stop", "Go to the school counselor or principal. Now\nThis could grow in to a big problem", "NTA.\n\nWhy am I downvoted?", "NTA.Your message to her was awful but after five months I can see where you are coming from.I think your friend is not seeing the big picture. You did a report in the police about the stalker behaviour. This show that this a whole new level of shit.This behaviour is absolutely criminal.  \nI was wondering... Did you try to talk with her parents? They are aware of this?", "NTA though you could have responded more tactfully, but that's also something that develops later.\n\nYou're 100% right in that what she's doing is innapropriate. Ask your friend if genders were reversed, what would her response be?\n\nTake it up with people at the school and report ALL of her account for harrassement. It's completely out of line and you need to get adults involved to help you and hopefully they'll get her some help.\n\nETA - What country are you in? Australia you can report online issues like this to eSafety", "NTA - but you didn\u2019t have to say the things you said to this girl. Instead you should have clearly stated in writing that this would be the last time asking her to leave you alone and if she bothered you again you were going to report her to the police. Then do that. It is irresponsible of your school to not have helped you. Stalkers can be extremely dangerous. Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this mess. You might try getting legal help. Another idea is to go sit in the principal\u2019s office and tell them you\u2019re not leaving until they handle this situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Bring this up during public forum. Use the words stalking, sexual harassment, and bullying. Read her fantasy post and tell them you are uncomfortable to say the least.", "NTA. Keep going to administration and document, document, document. I would also suggest sending that documentation to her parents on a regular basis via some kind of registered mail.  Build a case.  If no one at the school is going to help you with this I would consider hiring a civil attorney \u2014 she is interfering with your ability to get an education.

This girl is absolutely insane and could be dangerous. Like I mean physically harm you, or maybe harm a future girlfriend of yours. I don\u2019t know where she is on the spectrum but she seems HF if she\u2019s attending regular school, so she should be able to understand what disinterest is. I\u2019m sorry for your situation.

Collect all the evidence of posts she made and messages she\u2019s sent you to use against her when you need to.", "NTA!!!!! 100% this. Screenshot everything, write down every weird interaction with date and time. I want to say don\u2019t engage with her at all anymore. Unfortunately engaging is often used to victim blame and not engaging is often used to victim blame but in the setting of school/over the phone, I think not engaging will protect you from this coming back to you in any way. Every time she does something to make you uncomfortable, go to administration immediately and text your parents to tell them you\u2019re doing it so they have a log of all the interactions with admin. If it\u2019s multiple times in one day, who cares. They need to know the severity. If administration says that you\u2019ve been coming to talk to them too much hit them with a \u201cimagine how tired I am. I\u2019m missing out on learning because of this and I need help.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re allowed to understand this however you want. This to me is sexual harassment and should not ever be tolerated towards any gender ever. Make this a big deal if you want to with proper authorities. I am sorry this is happening to you hon. It\u2019s the worst being uncomfortable at school/home/work/on your phone because of ONE person. \n\nIt sounds like you have tried to get things to stop and it hasn\u2019t so you responded by saying unkind things to get the message across clearly. You\u2019re defending yourself when no one else is in the most non threatening way. \n\nLastly, tell your friend that her empathy towards this person because of her neurodivergence is only justifying and enabling her behaviour. Neurodivergent people can understand no, stop, leave me alone, I don\u2019t like you, I don\u2019t wanna talk to you and the likes. You deserve the empathy here. You are being put in a compromising position by someone who happens to be neurodivergent. That is not a valid excuse for her behaviour. Sure it may help to understand why she isn\u2019t respecting your boundaries but it doesn\u2019t make it okay. Advocate for yourself hard even if it\u2019s uncomfortable and tiresome.

He did everything right until he finally snapped at her about it when she DMed him from one of several accounts she made after being blocked on each new one.
