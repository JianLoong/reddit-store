Do you think now was the right time?", "NTA \n\nI think he tarnished his own reputation just fine on his own, you didn't do anything be share the truth. It wasn't your decision to start a secret family, that was all him. \n\nI think it's possible that the family members who blame you are in the anger stage of grief and some of them decided to misguidedly direct that anger toward you, for something that wasn't your fault, because you're there and he's not. Or maybe they would prefer to hold onto an idealized version of a person in their memories rather than confront the uncomfortable truth.\n\nThat said, immediately after his death while the family is still grieving was probably not the best time to spring this on them, so I can understand why some reacted poorly.

I also mean no disrespect, but the way I\u2019ve always seen it is \u201cif people want you to speak highly of them after death, they need to live their life in a way that leaves you no choice.\u201d You didn\u2019t tarnish a dead man\u2019s reputation, you revealed the truth. Imagine how Alex has felt his whole life? What your dad did was not ok, I\u2019m not saying tell *everyone*, but the relevant people need to know.", "NTA. He tarnished his own reputation", "NAH  given how easily a DNA test is the chances of the truth coming out are pretty high.

Then on top of that you added... yet another one of the most heartbreaking things someone can experience in their lives.\n\nBut since the cat is already out of the bag the only thing you can do now is help. I know you're still working through your own grief, but do what you can to get her into touch with a councilor or therapist so she can start to work through this surely overwhelming second shock of anger and grief.", "YTA.

I\u2019m assuming the file and pictures provided evidence, but he wasn\u2019t clear on this. The person to reach out to would have been Alex and his mom. Perhaps they would rather not have their dirty laundry aired, and had no interest in connecting with dad\u2019s family at all. He might have been able to fill in some pieces of the story.

Regardless of whether people had a right to know now was not the time, they were freshly grieving! It was down right mean of you to expose this secret now. It could have waited a year! Shame on you for bring your mom more grief during this time!", "For all OP knew, his mom was already aware. \n\nMy own mother had a half sibling come out of the woodworks when they were both adults.

Never mind that neither of my grandparents bothered to tell their other kids, she did not seem to understand why everyone else didn't already know.", "He just said pictures. They could have died tragically and he just never talked about it. Idk this is weird. There\u2019s a lot that could be if it\u2019s just pictures. If there is more, than that\u2019s another thing.", "NAH. Some members of your family will cry \"that wasn't the right time!\", but there's never a right time for this kind of thing. Telling as soon as you knew relieves you from the counterpoint of being accused of hiding the knowledge if someone else revealed it before you.\n\nThey're in shock and angry now but will get over this."]}
