She doesn't help clean the house, doesn't help cook, doesn't help with laundry, she doesn't do anything at all.\n\nThe other day I was not feeling well because I'm having a really difficult pregnancy, I feel exhausted and nauseous all the time so since the children were with her I took a nap. When I woke up it was past lunch time and when I went to the kitchen it was completely dirty because she had made pasta, but that was not the worst, the worst thing was that there was only one dish which meant that she had not cooked for my children. So I asked my eldest daughter and she said that her sister told her that she was going to eat and cooked for herself and told them to wait for me to wake up so I can cook for them. And that really pissed me off because we do everything for her and she couldn't take a minute to cook something simple for her siblings  and she couldn't clean up the mess she made either. \n\nI went to her room and started yelling at her to get out of my house because I'm sick of her, and I don't know if it was because I was screaming and crying or what, but she just told me to calm down, took some of her things and left. Then I found out from my husband that she was at a friend's house waiting for me to calm down to come back but I don't want her here, if she comes back I'll go and my husband knows that. He is paying her  hotel now, and he thinks that she will understand what she did wrong and that she will change, but that's not gonna happen I mean, it has been twelve years since we were together and she always hated me and i doubt she will magically change now. \n\nSo AITA for kicking her out and not letting her come back?\n\nEDIT: I'm not \"lazy\" as many of you say, I have hyperemesis gravidarum and there are days when I can't even get out of bed, but I still do it because I do all the household chores by myself. Of course my husband helps a lot too but it's not enough since the kids do sports and he spends most of his time taking them to training and to the games. And her daughter does nothing, I clean her room, wash her clothes (even her underwear) and cook for her every day.At first I didn't told her anything because I knew she was sad and having a bad time but then i told her to help me because i really feel bad but she never help me to do anything.", "created_utc": 1693428293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165q6q7/aita_for_kicking_my_husbands_daughter_out_of_our/", "score": 317, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Holy shit, what a mess. If you're wondering why she seems to hate you, it's because you are effectively the same age as her, and you married her dad as she was graduating high school. Watch Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure at some point, and pay attention to how everyone interacts with Missy.\n\nI mean, ESH. Did you ask her to care for the children while you took a nap? Or dump it on her? Did you ever ask her to help out around the house? She should absolutely clean up after herself, and contribute to the house while she is living there. But she's not a free housekeeper, either, there to watch your kids when you want a nap. More info might tilt this farther to Y T A, but with just what is provided here, she's not being a good guest or roommate, and neither are you being a good host or roommate.", "ESH first, how old were you when you got married? How long was your husband divorced? You could have been in high school with your stepdaughter and that didn't unsettle you? And now you've had 4 kids with a 5th on the way? I don't mean to shame people's choices, but damn, it's pretty flipping obvious what the problem between you and your \"step-daughter\" is. Your husband is literally old enough to be your dad. Like he had his daughter at 28 and you had your first daughter at 23? That shit's messed up. Did you think maybe she's realized her dad was her age when she was born and she's already had a divorce? \n\nShe should be doing stuff to help around the house. Not because she owes you, but because she owes herself. Getting in the headspace of making messes and not taking care of oneself isn't healthy. Helping kids get food is a normal enough thing. Mac and cheese is of no effort and kids love it. Kids at that age, really shouldn't be made the victims in prolonged arguments. But at the end of the day, she's not their mom. You are. Mac and cheese really is of no effort to make, and at 9, your oldest can easily make it. \n\nFor the love of the environment, get your tubes tied when you deliver this next kid. Sheesh. When your husband divorces you in 10 years to \"upgrade\" to the younger model (old enough to be their grandfather), you're gonna regret having a dozen kids to  manage on your own.", "Info: what happened to her mother?", "INFO:  What happened to your husband's first wife?  Did he dump her so he could marry a baby factory instead?", "ESH, probably.\n\nYou are having a hard pregnancy. I'm sorry and I hope you are pulling through and that everything will be all right with you and the baby. I hope this does not come off as patronizing, but I also am taking it into account as somewhat mitigating influence in making you a bit... emotional on this issue. It can be really tough.\n\nBut here is the thing -- you said she always hated you. But you married a man with a daughter almost your own age. That MUST mess with a girl's head. It's almost creepy, honestly. And he's her dad, so of course she has to push that ickyness onto you. You must be the enemy because you are the pretty young girl who is taking away her father's attention from his daughter at a time she probably really needed it, and if not you, then she'd have to hate him. That is not your fault, but I do think it would have been on you to work hard all these years to get along with her and repair some of the hurt your relationship with her father likely caused her. And how about you? Do you hate her because he loves her too and you guys are so close in age it feels weird and triggers some jealous?\n\nNow she is having a hard time and is seeking refuge with her dad... and you are -- in many ways not by any fault of yours -- making it impossible for her to really get that fatherly love and protection. Its a house full of little kids who need him more and you need him more because you are having a hard pregnancy. None of that is your fault, but I do wonder if you expect more than you have a right to from her.\n\nDid her father ask her to clean the house or do the laundry? Does she not wash her own stuff/take care of her own room or are you expecting her to \"earn her keep\" by helping with all the chores of your 4 kids? Because... you know... that at least has to be discussed. I wouldn't take that as a given. She was looking for a refuge with her father. Not play au pair? \n\nAnd what exactly do you mean when you say \"the kitchen was completely dirty because she made one dish of pasta\" -- how dirty could it have been? Are we talking like... a used pan and an unwashed dish in the sink? It feels over-reacty and a bit like you are trying to make of it than it probably was. \n\nYes, she probably should have just made something for the rest of the kids. But I would also ask... like, has that ever been a topic of contention before? Like have you ever criticized what she eats or makes for the kids so she might expect you'd rather decide what they eat? I'm not excusing her... just trying to get to some kind of explanation. It may also just have been a case of not being very thoughtful or not feeling like she is responsible for your kids. Again, what was the conversation on her role in the house while she stays with you all?\n\nAll in all, it's probably better for all of you if she stays elsewhere - even if that means more of a financial commitment from you guys. Lets hope she quickly gets back on her feet.", "I LOL\u2019d at you (32F) her (29F)\u2026 \nAside from that, they\u2019re YOUR children. Why is it her responsibility to cook for them? Yes she should\u2019ve cleaned up, but I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s her job to essentially babysit. And I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard for the woman 4 years younger than you to have a father who married someone who could\u2019ve been her sister\u2026 food for thought.

You should always clean up after yourself if you\u2019re living with others just to be considerate. His daughter is 28. She should be able to take care of herself and do basic chores. My roommates and I did in college and we were a lot younger. Not cool to just leave a mess around. And especially if you\u2019re not paying for food, just nice to make some extra for your younger half siblings right? \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have gone crazy on her though. A sit down talk should have occurred instead. Should have talked out her feelings about you (age gap?) and see if there\u2019s a way to co-exist peacefully.", "YTA you're literally 3 years older, you could have been friends in highschool, she's old enough to be your kids mum, you won't even look after your own kids or get your husband too, calling her a bitch isn't on either, also you don't get to say 'get out of my house now' is it actually just your house, how would you feel if your husband chucked your oldest out if she made a mess when she's older, also the threats aren't great", "Condoms. Say it with me\u2026. Condoms!", ">my children (9F, 7F, 5F, 2M) her siblings\n\nShe was 19 when the oldest was born.

But they are not HER children.  Did you ask her to care for them? Are you paying her to care for them?\n\n>I went to her room and started yelling at her to get out of my house because I'm sick of her\n\nSo rather than behave like an adult, you yell at her and try to throw her out without talking it over with her or your husband.\n\n>She got divorced a few months ago and was in a very dark place emotionally so we let her live with us until she feels better, but since then she hasn't stopped acting like a b.*t.ch.

Stop popping out kids if you don\u2019t want to deal with them.", ">my children (9F, 7F, 5F, 2M) her siblings\n\nOP, you've been popping babies pretty much nonstop since you were 22, and doing all chores for now 5 people. Like, seriously, no f-ing wonder you're feeling so ill, you body is spent and begging for rest.\n\nThis is really concerning. Honestly, how much of this was your full choice? Did you want such a huge family so fast or were you pressured? I don't usually jump on the \"he's a predator, she's been groomed\" wagon when there's an big age difference, but **please take a moment to consider** your relationship. Please.\n\nYou were wrong here, but I can't really call you an AH for not thinking straight in your situation (sick, 4 kids, another in the oven). You must be bone tired. But it's your husband who owes you support, not his daughter.\n\n\\*Try to get a sitter for at least a few hours a few times a week so you can rest.", "YTA. You can take care of your own kids...good grief. Being pregnant doesn't give you special privileges. Maybe you don't have a good relationship because someone her own age married her dad and then started popping out kids.", "INFO: Did you know your \"stepdaughter\" before you started fucking her dad? Cause I have an inkling that ya did. Follow up question, did you ever consider that being an old man's replacement daughter that he can legally bang was a bad idea before having 5 kids with said old man?", "YTA. It is not her responsibility to take care of your children just because you decided to go and get yourself knocked up a 5th time. Did you ever stop and think that maybe the reason you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her is because her dad married someone who was only 4 years older than her? And now you\u2019re trying to tell her what to do when you\u2019re practically the same age? Learn to be an adult and apologize to her.", "YTA - your kids are not her actual siblings, nor is she responsible for providing for someone else\u2019s kids. You went off on her despite having set no expectations about her living there. Could she have done more? Probably. But that\u2019s your responsibility as a mother unless you and your husband made helping out a stipulation of her living arrangement.", "So I have advice for you, stop breeding kids for gram... I mean your hubby and take care of yourself and definitely stop treating her like she is your step kid that you are parenting.", "YTA. You got together when you were 20 and your husband  was 44? And you\u2019re basically the same age as his daughter, of course she doesn\u2019t like you. Let me guess, he left his first wife (who was for sure his age) for you and you started playing stepmummy to someone almost as old as you?\nStop popping out kids if you can\u2019t handle them.", "It\u2019s so strange that people here discuss blood relatives and age difference.\nIt\u2019s just simple courtesy to help out when you stay at someone\u2019s place.\nAnd it\u2019s being a decent human being to feed children when their mother is weak.\n\nOP did not handle that communication well enough. But her husband\u2019s daughter seems to be a much bigger AH.", "ESH but you mostly for the simple fact that your attitude sucks.\n1. You're not worthy of her respect just because you married her father. He's old enough to be your father, and she is only a couple years younger than you. It is earned, not given and if your attitude here is anything to go by, you haven't earned it.\n\n2. You didn't ask her to cook for them. You just went to lay down, effectively shrugging off your responsibilities as a mother onto her without so much as the good grace to ask her first.\n\n3. Your pregnancy does not, ever, entitle you to someone else's time. If you need help, you ask. You don't ask, you don't get. It's very simple.\n\nNext time when you decide you want a nanny to fill in where you're slacking, have the decency to hire one. She is not your stepdaughter in any way other than pure technicality and you're not an authority figure to her. \n\nShe sucks because she's messy and should clean up after hersel, but you suck more.", "INFO: Have you addressed any of the mess and not helping issues before?", "ESH. \n\nYou for explode when talking to her. You could calmly ask her why she didnt cook for her siblings. \nAlso, if you want her to do shores at home you and her father need to talk to her and talk about that (even if this is basic courtsy for some people). \n\nShe is also an asshole. I get divorce is bad, having a step mom almost our age that we hate its awful, but the kids have no fault. She could easly make them some food. Not because they are her half-siblings, but because they are children!! Their pregnant mother were sleeping, it wouldnt cost her anything! The food is paid for! Her time it would be all she needed to spend! But she choose to leave them hungry. \nOP should have asked her to watch the kids? She already said she wasnt planning for a long nap. But even so, tell the kids to wait for their mother while she eats right there?! Cold blooded!\n\nYou, your husband and her need to sit down and have a talk!

It would be difficult for anyone to accept step mommy is just a bit older than me.  Worse that you started having all these children and are pregnant again.  \n\nYou need to have your husband set some rules, but you should not kick her out like you did.  She was wrong, but you are too.", "Lol at 3 year age difference between new wife and step daughter.

But who made the choice to have 5 children? Oh that's right. You did, AH.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't want to get along or even listen to a step-parent who's only 4 years older than me. That's incredibly awkward dude. Not to mention creepy.", "Well, she sees you as her dad's maid and baby mill. \nBy extension, you are her maid and cook.\n\nWhy would she get off her behind and do any work in her dad's house. \n\nAlthough your children she seems to have on a roller as the oldest of the helpless children.\n\nHer laziness, messiness and sloth should have been addressed at some point with a clearer head and even keel.

You chose to drop kids like they're a hobby, not her.  There's no reason she should be obligated to take care of your kids so you can nap.

She isn\u2019t responsible for them.  That\u2019s your job and you have no business ordering her around.  You are her dads wife,  not her mother.

If you are cooking, doing her laundry and cleaning a house she is living in, the least she can do is pitch in helping with the kids because there is nothing left to do.

She doesn't help clean the house, doesn't help cook, doesn't help with laundry, she doesn't do anything at all.\n\nThe other day I was not feeling well because I'm having a really difficult pregnancy, I feel exhausted and nauseous all the time so since the children were with her I took a nap. When I woke up it was past lunch time and when I went to the kitchen it was completely dirty because she had made pasta, but that was not the worst, the worst thing was that there was only one dish which meant that she had not cooked for my children. So I asked my eldest daughter and she said that her sister told her that she was going to eat and cooked for herself and told them to wait for me to wake up so I can cook for them. And that really pissed me off because we do everything for her and she couldn't take a minute to cook something simple for her siblings  and she couldn't clean up the mess she made either. \n\nI went to her room and started yelling at her to get out of my house because I'm sick of her, and I don't know if it was because I was screaming and crying or what, but she just told me to calm down, took some of her things and left. Then I found out from my husband that she was at a friend's house waiting for me to calm down to come back but I don't want her here, if she comes back I'll go and my husband knows that. He is paying her  hotel now, and he thinks that she will understand what she did wrong and that she will change, but that's not gonna happen I mean, it has been twelve years since we were together and she always hated me and i doubt she will magically change now. \n\nSo AITA for kicking her out and not letting her come back?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It was wrong of her to yell and kick out the daughter but soooooo understandable. NTA. \n\nIMO this is the Fathers job to clean up. He needs to set clear boundaries with his child on how to treat his pregnant wife and the expectation of her staying with them rent free (pitching in on the household duties and childcare). He needs to be the one who enforces it. Op needs to take a step back and concentrate on her kids and keeping her stress down during this high risk pregnancy.

I do think there's some truth being said, I'm just not quite sure if it's to the extent she claims.
