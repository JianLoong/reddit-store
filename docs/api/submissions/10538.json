Because they are not all equal not by a to longshot.", "NTA make it crystal clear that you do not agree and will not raise the child when/if it becomes too much for your sister. This is a human child, not a doll. Maybe get her one of those crying practice babies, see how she does for a few months straight! She may see how demanding it can be and decide against it.", "NTA- Everyone saying Y T A because \"people with learning disabilities can have children too\" clearly did not read the post, and are just jumping on the disability thing. If you take out the part about your sister having a disability everyone would be saying NTA because of everything else you said. According to you, your sister still has to receive tons of support from family, does not always make good decisions, is unorganized, and gets extremely stressed and anxious easily. If all this is true, that does NOT sound like someone ready to have a child. This is a HUMAN BEING your sister will have to take care of for the REST OF HER LIFE, and it sounds like she is not ready for the responsibility. People with disabilities absolutely can raise children, as long as the disability doesn't interfere with the ability to be a good parent.", "Tell your mother and other family members that you will not be involved in the childs upbringing. That it falls on your mother and any other family member who is in favour to take responsibility and that your mother has to find someone will take over when she passes away.   Your support extends to your sister who you love but not the future generations.\n\nYour mother has to know its all on her and to make plans. You pick up her up from work and go grocery shopping - tell your mother that will not be extended to the child or their needs or her pregnancy needs. Be blunt.  How will she deal with the hospital appointments, take the child out, take them to school, take them shopping, entertain them, take them on holiday?\n\nWho will pay for it all - if she stops working. Who will provide the emotional support of the pregnancy, post natal, raising a child? It has to be all your mother. But your mother is older, so who steps in after?\n\nOr withdraw all support now so your family realise how much you do. Say you need to take a mental health break for a month and let others step in.", "NTA \n\nI think you need to step away from helping your sister for quite awhile to make it clear what life will be like with a child. It does sound like she is incapable of parenting a child fully if she needs steady help from you and your parents. Your parents might also be overestimating how much they can help long term depending on their age and health so you are right to worry that a lot of slack might have to be taken up by you.\n\n\nI will add in agreement with most here, knowing what the disability is might help with the nuances of whether or not your sister and her disabled husband are capable of being full time parents.", "NAH\n\nYou have the right to voice your concerns and your sister has the right to have a child.  And its definitly good that she fully knows what she is getting into it", "NAH\n\nThe time to start is now. Start backing out of your sister's life now.  Stop helping her manage her own adult responsibilities. Be a cheerleader, not an equipment manager. Live your own life and mind your own business. Sister may just surprise you.", "NTA\n\nYou've been honest with her. \n\nIt's a difficult situation that you're in here because really, it's unfair for anyone to expect you to take on the responsibility of a child. But your sister is a grown adult and can make her own decisions.\n\nIs it likely that the child they would have together will have the same disability? If so, that's quite the decision to make.", "INFO what is the learning disability? The Only reason it matters is does it prevent her from getting a full time job? If so then NTA because no one needs to have a kid if they cant support themselves let alone a child.", "Nta and make it crystal clear that 1- you will not be caring for their child. 2 - if they try and dump the kid on you, you will call the police for an abandoned child.  3 - You will call cps if the child is neglected.", "NAH - you\u2019ve let your opinion known, as is in your purview to do so. Set boundaries as well, if they do have a child together let them know what you\u2019re able to and not able to help with. It isn\u2019t about you withholding some type of care or monetary help, it\u2019s as an adult sibling you\u2019re only able to help so much. Make that clear.", "NTA, how on earth are you the asshole? There\u2019s enough people on this planet. Babies are not accessories that you can put away when you get overwhelmed or turn them on and off. Average, normal people struggle every day to care for their child, what on earth are these people and your mom thinking. Get them a cat.", "NTA.  I have a disability and there's no way in hell I would risk passing that on to a child.  That's evil and narcissistic. Able bodied people have it bad enough and have enough struggles.  \n\nBut let's say she has no chance of passing it down.  She still cannot support herself alone and your mother is not going to live forever!\n\nSo YOU are basically saying you don't want to half adopt this child, because you know that many responsibilities will fall on you!  \n\nSo in that way, this is about whether YOU want to raise a child.  And that is always YOUR DECISION alone.  \n\nThe same would apply if a 13 year old wanted a child; she's not competent to be a mother and doesn't have the mental capacity for it.  It's not her choice", "YTA if you put in terms of her disability\u2014disabled folks are allowed to have children. (Otherwise we\u2019re getting into eugenics territory, which I know isn\u2019t what you\u2019re going for) that said You\u2019re re also allowed to not be expected to care for said child\u2014you are not the AH for not wanting to take on that responsibility. If your mom wants to take care of the little one she absolutely can. I would, however tell both your sister and mom that you won\u2019t take care of the child in the event of something happening to them, so that they can make guardianship arrangements. Your mom needs to make sure that the family and your sister understand and accept that you won\u2019t be taking responsibility for someone else\u2019s child.", "YTA. Rather than downright tell her it\u2019s a bad idea, why don\u2019t we help her more? Get her a baby sitting gig, show her what she doesn\u2019t see about parenthood. Make sure she is fully prepared to make that decision for herself, and then support her as much as you can.

This is a tough one but I agree with you that it may eventually fall on you to be more responsible. So I\u2019m glad you said your peace at least.", "NTA- people being overwhelmed with babies is often how abuse starts. I am by no means saying that is your sister, but putting people in situations that they can't handle leads to chaos. Read about shaken baby syndrome... perfectly normal, happy people can just snap while a baby is screaming for hours and in a moment of frustration end their kid's life. A baby is not just a 'thing'... babies deserve parents who are loving, emotionally stable, and able to care for them.", "NTA. Your perspective is a valid one. I remember years ago, reading something by a very successful businessman who said he had a rule to always have among his advisors someone who would look for the downside of any proposal he had. The businessman said he was sure this guy had saved his business at least a dozen times.", "You are entitled to your opinion and concerns, you have right to state them to your sister. May be if you can kind and honest discussions with her about having a child and what it could mean.\n\nYou sister is adult and has every right to have a full life and can include kids. Depending on the learning disability or autism, this will not mean they can\u2019t do this. It about having clear conversations and your sister fully understanding the choice.

That heavily impacts the judgment.", "I take her shopping/grocery shopping each week, pick her up from work. Mom goes round to see her most days, does little things for her to make sure she\u2019s keeping on top of everything. We both provide her with the emotional support she needs too", "I second this, I can't tell if we're talking about dyslexia or autism.  The spectrum here is very wide and will determine judgement.", "Yep.\n\nThat definitely determines the verdict here. \n\nNone of us know really how independently the sister and her husband can function in life..... Are we talking that they have ADHD and need a bit of prompting to clean and make it to work on time..... Or are they affected by something more pervasive like Down Syndrome, brain damage,  or severe autism?\n\nIs the family acting more as helping hands for light guidance, or are they acting more as caregivers so the couple can survive on their own?", "I would love that info as well but seeing what OP and their mom already does for OP's sister I think that she wouldn't be in the right place for child rearing unless she puts the work into changing her situation. Like is she able to drive herself and just doesn't?", "I mean, I am autistic. Definitely took me longer in life to get started. And certain things are harder, but in general I consider myself successful. I only worked for a couple years but enjoyed my job and coworkers. Now I am a SAHM which is literally all I have ever wanted to be. That said, I don't want my children to be autistic, but I think everybody wants their kids to be perfect and have no issues or troubles.", "I don't have kids, but I'm not sure if her sister is the person I'd want watching my child. \n\nThis is not ableism -- it is what the OP said -- her sister is child-like and doesn't always make the best decisions. This is not someone I would just trust with my child without supervision.", "I don't agree on the YTA but getting her a baby sitting gig is a great idea.", "babies arent like pets, where a family member could just adopt them from the sister if she couldnt take care of it - depending on the extent of her learning disability, OP and their mother could be saddled with raising this kid themselves. children are not a god-given right, and if you can\u2019t raise one without extreme help from family, you shouldn\u2019t have one - people should only have them if they are fully aware of the financial, emotional, physical risks that will stay with them for LIFE. Babies are not just accessories, they are going to grow into adults, and it seems like this is something everyone forgets. OP says they and their mother have to help the sister with various things as it is, so bringing a baby into the mix would be sheer insanity, in my opinion. As someone else has said, they should have the sister and her husband spend time with children alone, to show them what it\u2019s really like, if they\u2019re serious. While you can\u2019t prevent them from having children if they want, I would understand OP being against it because it just sounds like it would be so much extra work for OP. NAH", "Yes.  People with learning disabilities can still be good parents. YTA.", "So does your sister or her husband drive? If they don't that puts the responsibility of transporting the new child where they need to go on you and your mom.", "TIL: Learning disability means something different in the USA vs British English.  (But OP wrote mom so is probably not British).\n\nHere learning disabilities are things that give lower cognitive performance (brain damage, some developmental conditions etc).\n\nSpecific things which cause issues but don't lower overall intellect would be a learning disorder here (dyslexia etc.)", "If the sister has ADHD having a child isn't that big of a deal. Plenty of parents have ADHD and as long as she has the coping skills and support network she'd be capable of doing it. However, if she has a neurodegenerative disorder that makes her physically incapable of taking of herself, let alone another human than obviously she shouldn't be having kids right now. OP definitely needs to clearify", "This, there\u2019s no way I\u2019d leave my child with someone with an intellectual disability. Do not put an innocent child in potential danger for the sake of proving a point to her sister.", "People with disabilities can be amazing parents, but forget the fact she has a disability. OP said sister still has to receive tons of support from family (they even have to take her grocery shopping and pick her up from work), doesn't make good decisions, is unorganized, and gets stressed and anxious very easily. Does that sound like someone that is ready to have a child?", "Yeah, and honestly unless they live somewhere with good public transportation, driving is a need with a baby/child. There are so many doctor visits in the first year of life, along with last minute trips to the store to get the cough syrup or wipes, etc. Where I live you have to walk two miles (with no sidewalks but a good bit of traffic) in order to get to a bus stop, which is also the nearest grocery store. You are not taking a sick kiddo out for 4 miles total to get them some Tylenol if they have a fever. If they need to go to the doctor or urgent care/hospital are they going to have to wait until grandma's available?", "Huh. That's for that distinction. As a Brit myself I hadn't picked up on that difference but now I feel much better able to discuss my issues (or others) I have the correct terminology to use to get my point across better!", "I'm glad :) I have a younger sister with a learning disability and I've sat through a lot of meetings in my time ngl."]}
