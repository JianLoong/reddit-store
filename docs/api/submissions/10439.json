English isn't my first language, so sorry if there's any spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nA little bit of info; I'm 19F, and have been addicted to smoking since I was around 16. I recently stopped because my Brother (29M) and his fiancee, my sister in law (27F) offered me to baby sit my niece (2F) if I stayed clean from nicotine. I thought it was a great deal because I was activily trying to stop smoking, and was looking for a job. I have been baby sitting my niece for 4 months, and been smoke free for 6 months, as of yesterday.\n\nOn the the problem. My girlfriend (20F) is allowed over while I baby sit, because my brother knows her well. She still smokes, so the only rule is that she can't smoke in/near the house or in the garden. She's welcome to not come over the days I baby sit if this is too much, and she knows it.\n\nHowever, when I put my niece outside in her stroller to sleep and came back to check on her I saw my girlfriend standing with a lit cigarette. I told her to throw it out or go home, and she said \"No way I'm throwing it out, that would be a wast of money\" I told her she knew the rules, and broke my brothers trust. She kept on trying to argue with me, but I told her that it's my brothers house so it's his rules,if she didn't leave I would call my brother. She called me an AH and left. I texted my brother what happened.\n\nA few hours after she left she sendt me a text saying I was out of line to kick her out of a house I don't even own, and she couldn't belive I would \"snitch\" on her. She hasn't talked to me since then, and I feel bad about what I did.

Baffling that she's saying *you're* out of line. Your brother had very clear rules, which she intentionally broke. Of course you are going to respect your brother and his home and have her leave.

She\u2019s also rude and immature. \n\nI assume she has some nice qualities, but they\u2019re certainly not evident here. NTA", "NTA. Please dump her. She didn't respect your boundaries. She didn't respect the boundaries of the people who own the house. She also tried to turn it around and called you the ahole for respecting boundaries. She knew what the rules were so the consequences should not be a surprise. You also gave her a choice - put out the cigarette or get out. She chose to be sent out.", ">If she gave a damn about you she'd never light up around you.\n\nI never thought about that. For the past six months she has also offered me cigarettes, something she never did. She has said she's not happy about me stopping, because now \\*she has to\\* stand outside alone.. Maybe I should be happy she's not talking to me at the moment", "That's why I'd break up with her.\n\nFor future reference **always watch how someone acts to see their true feelings**.\n\nFrom what you said, she wants you smoking again and is trying to sabotage your attempt to quit.  And has been doing so for six months.", "I dated a girl once who was upset when I quit smoking because I wouldn't still be using the ashtray she'd bought me 6 months ago.\n\nSome people are dead weight.\n\nFind someone that thinks you're important.", "Some people hate to be miserable alone so they drag others down with them. I would sympathize more with the girlfriend if she didn't smoke around a young child and wasn't actively trying to sabotage OP's chance at quitting. Nicotine addiction is *awful*. But that isn't a reason to drag down others. I wouldn't be surprised if part of it was an attempt at having OP fired as the babysitter either. Two year olds tend to tell everyone everything, and her parents would (rightfully) be furious if they found out someone was allowed to smoke around their child, even if OP wasn't the one doing it", "Agreed 100%.  My mom was a smoker and I know how hard it was for her to quit.  It's more addictive then heroin.\n\nBut the fact that OP's GF deliberately changed their behavior as soon as OP decided to quit is a giant, flashing red flag to me.", "Just watched this [documentary episode](https://youtu.be/um-_wKailqU), and two of the children have hearing problems from second hand smoking. The doctor said that if the dad wanted to smoke, he had to smoke outside, change his clothes, shower, and stay away from his child for several hours before coming back inside if he wanted to smoke. NTA", "NTA.  If she can't respect the rules of the house, you had every right to throw her out.  She is not above the rules because she wants to smoke.  She sounds childish.", "Nta, but as others had said you should dump her \nI think that she intentionally broke the rule to blame you, for you to lost the job (as it was the reason why you quit smoking)", "NTA.  Smoking inside someone else's house is beyond nasty.  If I was your brother and you let your GF smoke in my house I would never let you back because it's harmful for the kid and destructive to my house.  Just gross.\n\nMaybe rethink this girlfriend.", "Hell nawwwww. NTA. You've done nothing wrong here, your gf has been very disrespectful", "NtA. She was being immature and rude. You were right to kick her out", "You did exactly the right thing.  Girlfriend needs to grow up.\n\nNTA", "You didn\u2019t \u201csnitch\u201d on her; your brother would have been able to tell someone had been smoking in the house the minute he walked through the door. NTA.", "NTA. Her disrespect and willingness to put your niece\u2019s life at risk, all while actively working to sabotage your freedom from addiction, is astounding. She is not a good person for you.", "Also \"snitched\"?  Brother has a nose, he's absolutely going to be able to tell someone smoked in his house.\n\nI'd be so, so pissed if someone smoked cigarettes in my house.  It's really hard to get the smell out of things.  If I was the brother I wouldn't let her in my house again.", "Smoking around infants also increases SIDS deaths.  Huge number of issues.\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/secondhand-smoke/health.html", "Oh wow. I know my brother doesn't want any smoking around his children because of our dad, who would smoke inside the apartment, and inside the car with windows **up**. But I haven't thought this could also be a reason", "So she cares more about her selfish need to not stand outside alone than your goals, health, or finances, and is actively working to sabotage you. That is not what someone does when they love another person. That is what they do when they love themselves above all else.", "It all sounds even more messed up when you put it like that", "I have a dirty lens because my granddad died of lung cancer (and my two grandmas died of cancers that are also linked to smoking).\n\nI remember my granddad coughing up blood clots towards the end of his life. It was just awful.\n\nDon't be with someone who would risk that future for you.", "I have friends who have struggled with drug and nicotine addiction, they've all said quitting nicotine was harder. \n\nAlso, OP, congrats on the six months. You're doing amazing, it's really not easy and you're doing such a great job. You're helping to make sure you get to spend more time with your niece, in the present and the future as you're helping your chances at being there while she grows up"]}
