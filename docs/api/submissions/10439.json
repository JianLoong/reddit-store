English isn't my first language, so sorry if there's any spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nA little bit of info; I'm 19F, and have been addicted to smoking since I was around 16. I recently stopped because my Brother (29M) and his fiancee, my sister in law (27F) offered me to baby sit my niece (2F) if I stayed clean from nicotine. I thought it was a great deal because I was activily trying to stop smoking, and was looking for a job. I have been baby sitting my niece for 4 months, and been smoke free for 6 months, as of yesterday.\n\nOn the the problem. My girlfriend (20F) is allowed over while I baby sit, because my brother knows her well. She still smokes, so the only rule is that she can't smoke in/near the house or in the garden. She's welcome to not come over the days I baby sit if this is too much, and she knows it.\n\nHowever, when I put my niece outside in her stroller to sleep and came back to check on her I saw my girlfriend standing with a lit cigarette. I told her to throw it out or go home, and she said \"No way I'm throwing it out, that would be a wast of money\" I told her she knew the rules, and broke my brothers trust. She kept on trying to argue with me, but I told her that it's my brothers house so it's his rules,if she didn't leave I would call my brother. She called me an AH and left. I texted my brother what happened.\n\nA few hours after she left she sendt me a text saying I was out of line to kick her out of a house I don't even own, and she couldn't belive I would \"snitch\" on her. She hasn't talked to me since then, and I feel bad about what I did.

She didn't respect the boundaries of the people who own the house. She also tried to turn it around and called you the ahole for respecting boundaries.

For the past six months she has also offered me cigarettes, something she never did. She has said she's not happy about me stopping, because now \\*she has to\\* stand outside alone.. Maybe I should be happy she's not talking to me at the moment", "That's why I'd break up with her.\n\nFor future reference **always watch how someone acts to see their true feelings**.\n\nFrom what you said, she wants you smoking again and is trying to sabotage your attempt to quit.

I would sympathize more with the girlfriend if she didn't smoke around a young child and wasn't actively trying to sabotage OP's chance at quitting. Nicotine addiction is *awful*. But that isn't a reason to drag down others. I wouldn't be surprised if part of it was an attempt at having OP fired as the babysitter either. Two year olds tend to tell everyone everything, and her parents would (rightfully) be furious if they found out someone was allowed to smoke around their child, even if OP wasn't the one doing it", "Agreed 100%.  My mom was a smoker and I know how hard it was for her to quit.  It's more addictive then heroin.\n\nBut the fact that OP's GF deliberately changed their behavior as soon as OP decided to quit is a giant, flashing red flag to me."]}
