English isn't my first language, so sorry if there's any spelling/grammar mistakes.\n\nA little bit of info; I'm 19F, and have been addicted to smoking since I was around 16. I recently stopped because my Brother (29M) and his fiancee, my sister in law (27F) offered me to baby sit my niece (2F) if I stayed clean from nicotine. I thought it was a great deal because I was activily trying to stop smoking, and was looking for a job. I have been baby sitting my niece for 4 months, and been smoke free for 6 months, as of yesterday.\n\nOn the the problem. My girlfriend (20F) is allowed over while I baby sit, because my brother knows her well. She still smokes, so the only rule is that she can't smoke in/near the house or in the garden. She's welcome to not come over the days I baby sit if this is too much, and she knows it.\n\nHowever, when I put my niece outside in her stroller to sleep and came back to check on her I saw my girlfriend standing with a lit cigarette. I told her to throw it out or go home, and she said \"No way I'm throwing it out, that would be a wast of money\" I told her she knew the rules, and broke my brothers trust. She kept on trying to argue with me, but I told her that it's my brothers house so it's his rules,if she didn't leave I would call my brother. She called me an AH and left. I texted my brother what happened.\n\nA few hours after she left she sendt me a text saying I was out of line to kick her out of a house I don't even own, and she couldn't belive I would \"snitch\" on her. She hasn't talked to me since then, and I feel bad about what I did. So, AITA?\n\nEdit: I hear you. She's trying to make me lose my job and/or trying to make me start smoking again.

Your gf doesn't respect you, your brother, your niece or the house. Smoking around someone whose been nicotine free for 6 months is so disrespectful & uncaring. Congrats to you too for quitting!

You are NTA and you need to consider how else she acts about you smoking! \n\nIf she was supportive of you, she wouldn't even be smoking in the same room as you! But it almost seems like she's purposely smoking in front of you because she wants you to start smoking again. Quitting an addiction is really hard, and it makes the people who don't quit feel worse about their addiction... So some of them try to sabotage. I think that's what she's doing. The fact that she puts her habit above your health is scary.", "NTA. You did the right thing. I saw your edit. I am sorry you might lose your relationship over this.

If someone smoked in my house, or even their friend, I would disown them and never let them near my home or child again. I say that as an ex-smoker who still vapes outside.

You had every right to do so, even more as it wasn't yours but in your responsibility. And you have my utmost respect for doing so, you served your niece well.", "NTA", "She wants you down at her level where it's comfy for her, in the muck but not caring enough to get up.\n\nNta", "NTA. Find a new supportive gf. This one seems to want to bring you down. You don\u2019t need that.", "NTA. Someone else mentioned this as well, but the fact that she\u2019s still smoking around you and OFFERING you cigarettes is a huge red flag. Your partner should want to support you in improving your life. The fact that she tries to get you to smoke again shows how self centered her world is. She sees you making positive improvements and doesn\u2019t want to improve herself, so she tries to keep you stuck where she\u2019s at in life.", "NTA\n\nAs an aspiring long-term nonsmoker, you need to get rid of this nasty girlfriend.  It's hard enough to quit smoking.  You don't need this asshole around you, offering your cigarettes.\n\nThe house issue is just a small part of this.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA you kicked her out of a house that you were, at that moment, in charge of. You were acting as an authorized agent for your brother and you had a responsibility to kick her out.", "She is possibly *more* toxic than nicotine- NTA", "NTA", "Got to be honest, I rolled my eyes at her when she said that.", "Honestly my biggest focus is my niece right now. I'm with her from 4am - 2pm every day, and she is in her first rebbeling phase hahaha. So I'm happy to \"get rid\" of the extra work. Because honestly, she would sit on the couch and bark demands at me, while watching me struggle with my niece. It wasn't her job to help, but it would have been nice to not have to do extra work", "They do here in Scandinavia. However when I was a baby (in the mid 80s) my mum would leave me in the stroller when grocery shopping and I don't think people are that risky anymore. Just outside your house, maybe outside a caf\u00e9.", "My uncle smoked like a chimney stack before my parents had kids. He never quit, but he never, ever smoked around us. He went outside, and if we decided we wanted to play outside he'd either go around back or stub it out and hang out with us. He wasn't a kids kinda guy but he loved us to pieces and I suddenly miss him a whole bunch.", "I wanted to say that I\u2019m proud of you for quitting. It is very hard, especially with the social aspect of it, which is why it may have been hard to realize that your girlfriend was behaving badly when it came to you quitting. The longer you go without it, the healthier you will be. You deserve the life you can have smoke free and you\u2019ve been so strong! I hope others have expressed how proud of you they are.", "As far as I know it's a European thing. Doesn't happen in the states, someone would call the police or steal the baby. (No judgement just stating a fact).", "It's really hard to get the smell out of things. If I was the brother I wouldn't let her in my house again.", "Thank you very much! It has been so hard, but my niece has been all worth it. She is the highlight of my day, so all the dizziness, increased and decrease of appetite, head aches is paying off.", "oh wow", "If you have the opportunity to speak to a doctor, you may want to. They may have advice about dealing with the side effects and ways to mitigate that. And while I am not a doctor, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re still having side effects 6 months after quitting.", " But seriously that is a huge Bsh move on her part. Hard enough to smell the lingering smoke on her. OP NTA.. find a non smoker"]}
