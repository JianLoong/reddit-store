I started off by booking a girls trip and I turned my location off and ignored him for the entire weekend. He blowed my phone up accusing me of cheating, saying he will divorce me over this etc. I told him \u201cwhat? I thought it was okay if we ignore each other\u201d and that absolutely set him off. I know it\u2019s so petty but i feel like he won\u2019t understand how I feel unless he\u2019s in the same place as me. Well next I reached out to a male coworker and vented to him about my marriage issues. My husband saw and accused me of having an affair with the coworker and said how inappropriate it is to talk to men about my relationship problems(LOL) \n\nI\u2019ve started watching videos of shirtless sexy men while I\u2019m right next to him and he feels very upset and jealous. Just like how I felt.\n\nNext im going to thunder down under in Vegas next month. Now believe me, I have expressed to him countless times how hurtful some of the things he does is. He apologizes and says he understands why I\u2019m upset but then one week later he will do something equally as hurtful. He\u2019s basically got 2 options, straighten up or he will end up divorcing me over copying his actions, and if he does that proves to me that I should have left him over doing these things.\n\nAm I the asshole for being so petty? I\u2019m honestly not really expecting a lot of NTA lol.\n\nETA: please stop saying to divorce. We have been together since i was 16 and we are very much in love. This is a VERY recent thing that has happened and I\u2019m not going to throw the whole relationship away over this. The only exception would be if he divorced me over copying his actions.

Because if you telling him that he\u2019s hurting you isn\u2019t enough to stop him from doing it again, hurting him in return will only make him feel more justified to keep doing it to you. \n\nI really doubt he\u2019s going to straighten out at this point, unless he agrees to some kind of counselling.

Just divorce since you guys don't like each other anymore.", "NTA.\n\nwhat's good for the goose is good for the gander. If he refuses to see that he's being a hypocrite, I'm sorry but I don't know if there's much hope for your relationship. I won't tell you to divorce him outright, but if expressing your feelings to him hasn't changed anything, and your giving him a taste of his own medicine is causing him to react exactly like you did, but with some idea that HE's justified while YOU are not... it doesn't sound like he truly sees you as equal partners.\n\nI'm sorry if you don't want to hear it, but if your marriage isn't based on mutual respect and love, then it's not one that's worth fighting for. To say you won't throw the whole relationship away over this sounds like you're already actively discrediting your own feelings. Is feeling like your husband doesn't respect or care about how his actions make you feel really a small thing? Maybe it is for you, but for me that is a massive issue.\n\nThe fact that you edit to point out you've been together since you were 16 seems kinda odd. Like, I understand that you've clearly invested a lot of time in this relationship, but it doesn't change the fact that your husband is being shitty to you. It's completely irrelevant. If he were cheating on you, would you still cling to the fact that you've been together so long as a reason not to leave? Plus, being 16 when you got together, it's pretty fair to surmise that this is basically the only real relationship you have had in your life. So, it kinda feels like you're a little clouded by the fact that you have nothing else to compare your relationship to.\n\nOf course all of this is just my opinion on the matter, only you can decide what is and isn't a deal breaker for you, and what kind of action needs to be taken if something is indeed a deal breaker. But based on what you've told us, my opinion is that your husband doesn't legitimately respect you, otherwise he would understand that the things you've been doing are exactly what he had done to you first. And instead of arguing and lashing out at you for it, he should be rethinking his own actions and making adjustments to satisfy the woman he is supposed to love and want to be with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: after seeing all of OPs comment replys etc, I'm changing my verdict to ESH. You really seem to believe that he is going to suddenly understand how you feel and stop these behaviours, but everything you've said points to the fact that he will not. You have spoken to him directly, he apologizes, and then does the same shit. You have started doing the same things to him, he clearly DOESN'T get it. If he can't listen to your direct communications, and he isn't responding to your pointing out what a hypocrite he is, he just isn't going to. I'm sorry but I don't think you have a snowballs chance in hell that your marriage is going to get back to what it was before, and at this point I'm doubting if it ever was very good to begin with.", "You were in love not anymore", "NTA, and the ESH ones are silly. You've talked to him, he doesn't listen. Though I do think your endeavors won't get you want you want, either. If he divorces you for your behaviour, he isn't going to have a moment of clarity where he realizes you were right, he's just going to tell people you cheated on him and you'll then have to deal with that as well.\n\nYour best bet is couples therapy or divorce, as much as you want people to not recommend it.", "\"Stop saying to divorce... we are very much in love\"\n\nIt really doesn't sound like it, tbh :/ Somebody who loves you wouldn't disrespect you - over... and over... and over! - like this. \n\nGo to therapy if you want, but keep in mind that you can't force him to change. What has he *shown you with just actions* thus far? Seems like he's just telling you what you want to hear and says he'll stop doing the things to get you to stop talking, but that's all it is. Don't bury your head in the sand wishing things were like they were. They're not.", "The fact that you think he's very much in love is hilarious.  He cheating.

Sounds like he is the guilty one and is simply admonishing you and deflecting to play those age-old tricks to take the heat off himself. He's playing jedi mid tricks and yes, he is showing you exactly what he's been doing by saying he'd leave you for doing exactly what he does. Classic. Petty? Yes, but sometimes people need a mirror of their behavior to understand the impact of their action and how hurtful they are. I'm not mad at you for this, but how long will this go on? If he's not adjusting his behavior, it's because he likes what he's doing and just doesn't want you to do it.

I cannot imagine he is being faithful. Do yourself a favour and have some self respect. A man that is madly in love and respects you doesn't so blatantly ignore you.

What you did was good to get clarity of what is going on.\n\nNow you know that your husband knows that his actions meant disrespect, cheating, affair and even divorce because that\u2019s how bad his copied actions are.

I'm not saying if you yell it's broken, but once that's one of the highlights of the relationship, instead of working towards understanding... That's a broken thing.

Maybe this female coworker?\n\nEarly in our marriage, my husband befriended a coworker that started kind of pushing him to do things he didn't typically do.  What was even more frustrating was this coworker was female and kind of used that to push her agenda.  There was no cheating, but she definitely got into his head.  And anytime I expressed my concern, he would apologize and then rinse and repeat.  The biggest challenge for us, is he was directly in contact with her 8-10 hours a day.  I didn't have that. I had no chance at that point.\n\nShe ended getting transferred to a different department, and then ultimately fired for inappropriate behavior with another coworker.

If you can't make it through couple's therapy with behavior changes, you need to leave because being petty just makes you both miserable, that's not what normal, happy, healthy relationships do, and refusing to heal because your person won't heal first only hurts you the worst in the end. Love doesn't make a relationship, active partnership does, and your partner is checked out from actually being a partner and communicating with you.\n\nBeing petty does in fact just make the relationship worse, it doesn't actually prove anything to the partner, because they're caught up being defensive in their feelings and are not in a place to receive and understand what you're communicating. For a lot of people, they'll say anything to get you to be not mad at them, but they have zero understanding of why you're actually mad or how they're hurting you.
