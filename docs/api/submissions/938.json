Didn't grow up around other races.", "He's planning on colonizing her.", "It's a little more nuanced than that. It's more that she didn't see that side of him. The dude has two personalities.

Second time, he made some comment to the effect of he stopped watching the NFL when those n------s started to kneel. Said it while he was drunk and we were playing pool. His buddies all laughed. I said, I guess racism is funny down here. He replied it was just a joke. Stop being so PC. So it was clear to me who he really was. But not to her. After this, she gets it now. I think she's just pissed in general that she was with the guy. Can't see it lasting the week to be honest.", "She's 33. He's 45-50. Don't know his exact age.

If she isn't ready now and shuts you out, please be ready when she realizes it.", "NTA. OK, for the moment, let's set aside the boyfriend's racism and your friend's \"naivet\u00e9\".\n\nSend your friend a link to an article on a viral blackface post and ask her if she wanted this to he her and her boyfriend. \n\nThey would have been filmed or photoed if they went out like that, and it more than likely would have been posted on hit social media. She and her BF could have faced a lot of backlash, including losing their jobs.\n\nBack to the racisim - You explained to your friend why it was wrong, and she knows her boyfriend is a racist. She is no longer naive on the subject, she just doesn't care. She would rather cater to a racist and the overtly racist things he does. Lie down with dogs, get up with flees.

There were about 10 people there after the bars closed. All very drunk playing pool. I'm sure she's heard him say stuff like that before. But I don't think it registered the way it would if you're from here.", "She had never heard of blackface. She gets it now. I think this whole thing opened her eyes to who this guy really is. I don't think they'll be together long.", "I mis-read it. Gap years are rare. Mature students yes: my hubby did not start college until his late 20's/early 30\"s.", "I mean\u2026people from other countries can still be racist.  ALOT of people from south Asian countries have terrible opinions about black peoples. You shouldn\u2019t just assume and let your friend off the hook.", "I was wondering if she fully understood the meaning of the word. When my Oma moved to the US from Germany many years ago, she heard someone use the N word and because it's similar to the socially acceptable term used in German, she assumed that's what black people were called. Someone had to correct her after she used it once. She genuinely thought that was the correct way to label African Americans and did not know the connotations attached to the word at all. I can't help but wonder if this is a culture thing that she isn't understanding the full meaning of. That she's now mad at you suggests either that or that she does not care at all, either of which should be addressed if you're comfortable with doing so.", "Yeah, I\u2019m just not buying that a grown woman can live in America for a decade and not know that blackface is racist, unless they\u2019re surrounded by nothing but racists", "Unless she lived in Bikini Bottom under a rock with Patrick Star? She is *wise to how Blackface is racist*.", "She literally had never heard the term. I had to explain it to her. But yes, she has lived in Texas for most of that time. So it's fair to assume she's around a lot of racists. But they're low-key racists. The kind with back the blue stickers on their trucks who swear they're not racist, but will drop the n-word when they think they're among friends.", "My holdup is that if this guy was comfortable enough with you to use the n word in your presence, then I would bet money that he has used it much more often in front of your friend. \n\nRegardless of not knowing what blackface is, your friend almost certainly knows that they are dating a racist and is ok with that."]}
