Been there, done that, won\u2019t do it ever again. \n\nIn fact, after my divorce from a man who was similarly enmeshed, when I started dating again, I screened men about their familial relationships right up front.

Was the comment made when you found out he made plans to add the half bath?

I think the timing makes a difference. \n\nRegardless I see nothing wrong with. Telling your husband that his habit of bringing his mother into discussions that involve you and him and your nuclear family isn\u2019t fair to you. How would he feel if you consulted your father rather than him? But the discussion needs to take place when one of these oversteps takes place.

You are probably third on his list of priorities(mother, kids, you).\n\nNot knowing your financial situation or anything else, I do know you have 3 young children and a father to them but not a husband.  You can set boundaries, but can't guarantee he'll keep them(he shows no evidence of it so far).  \n\nWrite a pros and cons list.  Be honest with yourself about what you NEED and want in this relationship.  What are your expectations for him to be a good husband to you.  Write it down if it helps, record it if it helps.  Get something Unemotional and detailed down in some form then present it to him.  Don't let him diminish your position or boundaries--because he's going to call you emotional and the a-h and then claim to be hurt and that you are trying to estrange his family, etc.  Be prepared for that, practice CALM answers. \n\nAlso prepare yourself for the steps you need to take to achieve changes.  Therapy, choosing to stay with your parents(with children) for awhile. Insist on a fairer setup-house middle or closer to your parents as a non-negotiable stance(if you buy new).  Know the lengths you are willing to go IF he will not compromise to the degree you need(not want).
