OP I think you need to sit down and talk to step niece, before making any final decisions on anything, it feels as if you have gotten drug into the middle of something that you may not have all the facts to.", "NTA. SIL sounds way too entitled and unhinged to be bluntly trusted, therefore I'd take SIL's words with a grain of salt. Step niece wanted to come, she would not if she were uncomfortable around your niece. If girls indeed have something going on between them at school, a fun family trip can be a bonding experience and possibility to get to know each other.", "Your step-niece would need consent of her parents to go on this trip, so it's not your decision. Her parents might want to look into that bullying situation because it doesn't sound as though they have resolved it. Finally, if the step-niece's mother is that crazy and unwilling to have a civil conversation, then you might have dodged a bullet.", "ESH. This is a big mess. I have 2 nieces myself, and I would absolutely not reward them with a trip if I heard they were being a bully. However, I also could not take one and not the other. I feel like the mother should have minded her business. You will now never know if this trip could have been a good bonding experience for the girls...", "ESH. Your SIL for making a demand that was pretty damn entitled. You for not even blinking at the fact that your niece was a bully. That probably deserves a moment's thought and a talk with her parents, not just brushing it under the carpet.", "NAH.  But sit both of them down together and see if this issue can be resolved.", "I\u2019m going with ESH except for step niece. Clearly your niece has had a rough time of it but that\u2019s no excuse for being a bully. And, by your own admission, she has been a bully for a long time now and no punishment or talking to her has made her stop. This is where you come in. You have the chance to try to mould her into a better person. But you are choosing not to - not your problem ey. Multi generational AHs in this family. \n\nYour new SIL shouldn\u2019t have \u2018expected\u2019 you to cancel your trip.

This is not about you taking the niece for the trip instead of the stepniece, this is about you taking the niece for a trip at all despite knowing she has behavioral issues. I get that you're not her parents, so you can't discipline her. But you can say \"you should improve your behavior if you want me to take you to trips\" to show that you wouldn't put up with it, and just take your nephew. But that's the crux of the problem I think - you would put up with it. The bullying is not a big issue for you so she gets a pass because you're not personally affected/she's your niece. Hence my ESH.", "Thinking about it some more and I am surprised you did not first check with your step niece what she wants to do. It seems like she did want to go, even when she knew your niece was going. Now she's just going to hear from her mum that you're excluding her, and if SIL is behaving this erratically, she might not be truthful about the reason why. That could really hurt your step niece, OP, and aggravate the bullying. I suggest you reach out and touch base and get to the truth of the matter before you exclude her.", "So, stepniece was eager to come on this trip, despite this supposed bullying? But now her mother calls to ditch niece, meanwhile acting like a big fat bully herself? I don't know what's going on there, but this doesn't add up. She can keep her daughter at home, that's for her to decide. She doesn't get to bully you into ditching your niece. NTA.\n\nETA: I'm not denying niece is bullying stepniece, and something needs to be done about that. I just don't see OP taking stepniece, a girl she hardly knows, on a trip. What problem does that solve?  Stepniece coming on the trip should never even have been on the table.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, OP\u2019s step niece asked to come. That\u2019s not the behaviour I\u2019d typically associate with a victim of bullying, to ask to go on a trip with their bully, so I assume that either SIL is lying for whatever reason or OP\u2019s invite was what triggered the bullying in the first place (niece perhaps wanting to go without her stepsister). In the case of the latter, then YTA but I really don\u2019t understand why people are basing their judgements off one person\u2019s claims. Like, where is the story from the niece and the step niece?", "Okay whew I\u2019ve read your responses and imma get the rating out of the way YTA.\n\nYou really are enabling her bullying, it\u2019s basically a slap in your stepnieces face that yet another thing is ruined by your niece. Your niece is winning, she\u2019s getting her way again. Now I\u2019ve seen some responses of yours where you say she\u2019s already a bully in school and other people are taking care of it to help her but you just want her to \u201cbe happy\u201d.\n\nThis is so contridictive, it\u2019s like someone trying to help someone get over an addiction but another person (Aka you) are feeding the addict their addiction behind their backs.\n\nYou need to have a talk with her guardians. You may not think your influences impact your niece just because you are her parent but that\u2019s not true. As long as she has one person telling her that bullying people is okay let\u2019s go have fun she\u2019s gonna keep doing it no matter what her guardians are doing. You are showing her it\u2019s okay through your actions and how it\u2019s okay to ruin something for someone else.\n\nYou need to set boundaries for your treats and your niece and only give her rewards when she actually makes progress becoming a better person. It\u2019s the only way to save her from becoming awful in the future", "What the ever loving fuck is wrong with people in the comments saying Y T A? OP is NTA.\n\nStep-niece's mother demanded that the niece be excluded from a trip that OP is planning. That was not her demand to make. If she doesn't want the girls being together, then that is her prerogative, but she doesn't get to dictate shit to OP. \n\nFurthermore, it is not OP's job to parents these children. Yes, the bullying needs to be addressed, but that is up to the niece's parents / guardians.\n\nEdit: spacing", "NTA. As someone who comes from a family of a lot step sibling/half siblings, we all went on different trips/vacations depending on family. My step-extended family would take my step sisters on trips all the time without taking me and I went on trips they didn\u2019t go on. In my friends families where they had step siblings the same thing happened so. I get trying to be inclusive, but I think that\u2019s hard in step family sometimes.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. It sucks that your niece is a bully, she should be punished for that, it\u2019s not your job. If both your brother and SIL were aligned on her not going that\u2019s one thing, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. I don\u2019t blame her mother for going to bat for her, but she\u2019s got a husband problem if she\u2019s having to yell at you about it. \n\nThat said, you don\u2019t really seem to give all that much of a damn about your step niece\u2026 or your nieces behavior frankly. A good compromise may be you doing something special one-on-one with your step niece. If you continue to treat her differently, the situation isn\u2019t going to improve.\n\nI\u2019d also say as an aunt, you can absolutely call out your niece on her shit behavior from a place of love. 2 years of being a bully is too long as a kid, even if you\u2019re grieving.", "NAH\n\nI agree that it's not your place to punish your niece. I don't think you are enabling your niece like some others seem to think. Your niece seems to have some problems and it can be good for her to have an aunt who doesn't is on her back. \n\nI understand that the decision to exclude your stepniece was taken in the heat of the argument. It's understandable, but wasn't right. Now your stepniece is punished for something her mother did. The whole discusion went the wrong way, and you could have handled it better.\n\nI would apologize to the Sil for excluding your stepniece, invite her again and promise to keep an eye on those two. The trip could be a bounding moment for stepniece and niece. They are still family to each other.

I don't understand how the mom thought that she could get you involved in punishing your brother's kid. Even if your niece is being an AH, that still doesn't mean she can require you to change plans to exclude her.", "ESH, at least the adults. Has anyone of you thought to talk to the kids about this?

Anger often replaces emotions like grief, sadness and desperation. If your niece was my kid I would get her into therapy asap.", "NTA.  You've only got the word of an angry mother about the bullying.  That's a lot of gray area open for interpretation. \nThis is an established trip that the same lady is thrusting her kid into.

I think getting both sets of parents together and telling them to sort it out is probably appropriate.

You feel powerless, you are forced to watch as your child is methodically tortured, but no one seems to intervene or take you seriously.

So yeah I think YTA.", "ESH. You should not be expected to uninvite your niece from the trip just based on hearing a one sided story. Your SIL is understandably upset if this is happening but has no right to scream at you and make demands. \n\nBut it's a bit of an A-H move to just automatically exclude your stepniece just because her mom is yelling at you. It also sounds like you didn't even think of including your stepniece until she found out about the trip from her cousins.

Maybe the niece wasn\u2019t active in that bullying and just a sad follower or maybe the step-niece wanted to become closer to her by forming this memory together. You would obviously make sure they all behaved.

You offered a trip which included going on said trip with specific people, and if the SIL didn't like who was going, she and her daughter could decline.\n\nThat said, maybe have a chat with your niece about being nice to others.

Ultimately it probably is better for her not to go on the trip, as it is clear that if anything happened under your supervision you would not have this poor girl\u2019s back and seem to believe she should put up with any ill treatment simply because she isn\u2019t blood related or she hasn\u2019t known you as long- which is incredibly sad. \n\nNo you don\u2019t need to resolve this problem - that is the responsibility of both sets of parents, but this is still a child in your community. You could still treat and talk about her with an ounce of empathy and respect.", "Wow based on your comments YTA no question asked.

But they will be family for the foreseeable future. The adulte in their lives should behave like adults and help them overcome this issue and learn from it.", "NTA.

The bullying is not for OP to punish - which doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t have a conversation with niece about it, but she\u2019s allowed to spend time with her niece as she always as she always has.", "If YOUR niece is bullying HER kid, maybe YOU should act like an adult about it.", "ESH. She should have just pulled her daughter from the trip instead of telling you what to do. You suck because you seem to have such a callous attitude to bullying and that your niece is a bully.", "YTA.  You've known for over 2 years that your niece is a bully and yet you still reward her with a trip and punish the victim.  That makes you just as much of a bully.", "YTA. Regardless of the tradition behind this trip, you already invited your step-niece but then un-invite her for being bullied - something she has no control over - and the only justification you give her mom is \"my trip, my rules.\" Perhaps SIL jumped to an extreme solution because she was upset, but instead of finding a solution that works for everyone you invited, you went with the one that was easiest for *you*.", "jesus christ some of these comments are unreal. you are NTA OP. i find it curious that your step-niece is the one who asked to come on the trip, but her mom made a huge drama about it and tried to get you to uninvite the person the trip is actually for. sounds like some meddling and i\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t cave.", "NTA, a lot of people seem to be missing the fact that this trip is for your niece and nephew.

You do you but it isn't a good look. It also reinforce to your niece that being a bully is perfectly fine.", "YTA. Please take this response with a grain of salt. I am only saying YTA because it seems, from the post, that you made this decision just to spite SIL which would not be fair to Step Niece. It looks like you only had SIL's side of the story which could be exaggerated or missing details. You could have tried to have some conversations with the children and get their sides of the story before making a decision. What step Niece is calling bullying might be familial teasing. It just seems like a very rushed decision.", "NTA. Your SIL put you on the spot, and forced you to make a rash decision.  The issue that I see here, is that this trip is a tradition that you do every year. It\u2019s unfair to tell you what you will or will not be doing with your trip.  Your niece and nephew likely look forward to this trip, and spending time with you. \n\nIt was generous for you to invite SIL\u2019s daughter in the first place. You weren\u2019t obligated to do that. I wonder why, if your step-niece is so badly bullied, why she would want to go?  Your step-niece is old enough, this should have been a conversation to have with her involved - not your SIL just yelling at you. You were screwed either way. If you take step-niece, and exclude your niece, that could cause resentment and escalate the bullying. If you exclude the step-niece and take your niece, it looks like you\u2019re playing favorites, and your step-niece could be extremely hurt - thinking you excluded her for unknown reasons. \n\nIdeally you should have spoken with your brother and SIL before inviting your step-niece.  But here we are. So now what should have happened was SIL should have filled you in on the bullying (without cornering you) and then had a conversation with her daughter about what she wanted to do. Did she really feel comfortable being alone with niece? Why did she want to go? What does she want to do? Together, SIL, and daughter should have figured out what concerns they had and how step-niece wanted to proceed, then had a private conversation with you about it.  SIL needs to be a parent and get involved. Not back you into a corner and demand a solution. This is a complicated situation, and quite frankly, your step-niece is old enough to decide if she wants to put herself in that situation or not. \n\nIf step-niece truly doesn\u2019t attend, then you should take that time with your niece to explain how her actions are hurting people, and talk about the bullying, and how she\u2019s feeling.  It could be a good learning moment for her.", "You are in a hard situation where someone will be upset no matter what you do.  However, I can't vote you the ahole to make decisions on your own trip.

All she has to do is pick a target, egg her friends on, and then sit back and enjoy. If it gets reported or noticed, she can play innocent because other than her co-conspirators who are unlikely to snitch, no one can point to anything she actually did so there's enough plausible deniability that if she can't manage to completely avoid punishment, it's likely to be a little slap on the wrist. \n\nWhen the bullying incidents came to light, did she immediately admit it or did she lie and try to manipulate the people around her to avoid being held accountable? If it's the latter, that means your niece is an unrepentant repeat bully who also has a history of lying and manipulating others when it suits her so you need to look at situations involving her with a critical eye.", "\"Mostly my nieces friends\" \"and not her\" are contradictory.", "Okay that should have been included in the original post, the answer to why the niece wants to go with her bully still stands.", "They are handling it at home by saying the niece isn't allowed to go. She doesn't get to override and decide nuece should go anyway but also say she's not involved in parenting. A yearly trip *is* a perk and reward. And her parents should be allowed to take it away anytime.", "Did her brother get married immediately after meeting his wife? She never met the girl or been around her at any point? If you don't think steps are real family, just say that.", "No, I got all that, it's just in another comment OP mentions nieces mother died too. Thanks though.\n\nETA: Yes, mum died 5 years ago, dad died 2 years ago.", "How? Because it doesn\u2019t seem your niece is stopping \u201cthis.\u201d It seems she\u2019s expanding her bullying horizons. But great that you\u2019re rewarding her behavior with a great trip.", ">\tI didn\u2019t say I\u2019m ok with it? I said my parents are helping her stop this\n\nWell?  What are the results? It would appear niece is still a bully.", "And your niece, whom you admit is a bully to numerous others, doesn\u2019t deserve a birthday party either.", "Except she's known about her niece being a bully for 2 years and continually rewards it.  Punishing someone and choosing not to reward nad behaviour are 2 separate things.", "Doubling down on being a petty vindictive person based solely on genetics that are only losely tied to you is a choice.", "No wonder your niece is a bully, must run in the family.", "If you don't think you could possibly be wrong, why post her?\n\nLoving your niece doesn't mean being the fun aunt/uncle. It means helping them grow into better people.\n\nYou sound like you don't care one bit that she is a bully. Your niece needed to be cheered up so you started this. Now what about all the unhappiness she actively causes in the life of others? \n\nMaybe if she saw that her actions had real consequences, that people who love her DON'T WANT TO HURT OTHERS, she may be motivated to change and improve her behaviour.\n\n Of course you could just be pretending to care about your niece, and you don't really care if she's a brat or not.", "This is disgusting. YTA just for your comment that you\u2019ll start this tradition with your step niece after her mother dies. I hope your new SIL recognizes your family\u2019s red flags and keeps her daughter away from all of you.", "Wow. I guess we now see where niece learned to bully people.", "It very much is a reward.You are encouraging your niece to be a bully and to abuse others. You are enabling and even defending this behavior. That is disgusting; you are certainly not as grown up as you might think you are. YTA on many different levels. Traditions can be cancelled; if this was my niece, I would straight up tell her that until she learns and understands just how terrible her actions were, there would be no more vacations.\n\nEDIT - corrected from award to reward.", "Oh and just FYI but someday your niece is going to use her grief to bully the wrong person and she's going to get hurt. Very likely badly hurt. So you have a choice here. You can help your parents to get it through to her and actively come up with real solutions. (Being grounded for a week isn't working unless you ensure she isn't just playing games or texting and enjoying herself be realistic)  or you can actively let her get hurt because experience will teach her too. The lesson is just harder in that case.", "Info: I\u2019m just trying to get the family dynamic situated in my mind \u2014 so your niece has no parents? Both mom and dad passed away at different times? Dad was one of your brothers, step niece is the stepdaughter of another brother. The two nieces go to the same school/grade - did they know each other before the marriage, and if so did they have issues before the marriage? \n\nReading your comments you definitely sound a bit defensive. But if it\u2019s true the niece is a 14yo girl with no parents, I can see why her life has spiraled into maybe not making the best choices in re friend group. Doesn\u2019t excuse her participation in the bullying BUT the unfortunate reality is that grief is one giant AH. Niece needs a tremendous amount of therapy and a large support system. \n\nYou\u2019re not her parent or guardian so I understand how you would compartmentalize the trip away from any punishment she may receive in her household by her legal guardians for actions taken at school. \n\nBullying does require consequences. But are they your responsibility to mete out? I don\u2019t think so. \n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate that the bullying was done to someone who is now in the family and amends do need to be made. But again, this does not fall into your wheelhouse IMO. \n\nYour trip has always been two specific children. It was nice to include a third child who is now in your family. It is up to the parents/guardians to determine which children attend - if nieces grandparents decide of their own accord that part of niece punishment for bullying is that she doesn\u2019t get to go on the trip, that\u2019s fair. If step nieces parents decide that proper amends haven\u2019t been made and step niece can\u2019t be around niece then it\u2019s their choice to not allow step niece to go on the trip. \n\nIt should never have come down to you being forced to make decisions about how to include or exclude. You invited three children and that offer should still stand. If nephew doesn\u2019t go unless niece goes, then the niece learns the natural consequences of her actions sometimes impacts/hurts others who were never intended to be hurt in the first place. \n\nThese are also teenagers who will go out into the world in just a few short years and need to learn how to deal with interpersonal issues amongst themselves, especially now being family. It may be a good idea for all of them to go on the trip with someone not a parent to any of them and get a fresh perspective with a different type of opportunity to bond in a new way. \n\nHonestly the first mistake you made was including the step niece to begin with. This trip sounds like a memorial trip tradition that probably has a lot of significance to your niece in ways that the step niece will never understand and maybe she shouldn\u2019t have been included in because of the memorial significance. You could always start a new tradition with all of them and even other family members - an annual cabin trip or camping trip for all of the family for example, while still retaining the memorial trip as it has always been. \n\nMaybe I get downvoted into oblivion.Teenagers are hard. Grief is hard. Adding in new family is hard. Trying to please everyone at once is hard.", "Wait, I thought you said it was her father, your brother, who passed away.  If it was changed to stay anonymous, that's ok.", "Well, I guess we can see that inclinations toward being a bully is also a family tradition.\n\nYou are rewarding her behavior by taking her on the trip. The trip is a treat, and always has been. And you know it. You just can't be bothered to care if she's a bully.", "NTA - you have a grieving 14 y/o who is acting out and has dealt with more loss than I ever have. Who is among the youngest in her grade! I\u2019m so sorry for your and her loss. I think you need to offer stability wherever possible and show her that her family is tight knit and not going anywhere. And of course she needs therapy, and discussions about how to treat people. But don\u2019t replace her on a trip with someone she clearly doesn\u2019t get along with, that\u2019s absurd. \nMaybe -after everyone has calmed down - you can schedule a fun activity with both girls and yourself. Help them build their own relationship instead of making it more acrimonious by parental involvement.", "By denying your step niece a place on the holiday, yet allowing niece to go is rewarding your niece for her bullying.\n\nI would say that your actions demonstrate that you approve of your step niece being bullied.", "You either are having issues with comprehension or are being purposely obtuse.\n\nThe trip was not planned as part of a reward system, no. But taking the kid on said trip after being made aware of her poor behavior is in essence rewarding that behavior. You admitted in other comments she's been having issues with bullying other kids for some time, so there's really little reason to believe she isn't engaging in that behavior now. \n\nIt really seems like you wanted a reason to not bring your step niece and had one fall into your lap. So enjoy getting your way, but don't get in your feelings when other people call you an asshole for it...when you went out of your way to ask.", "No. You won't.. She's your stepniece.. As if you going to look after her after her mother the stepmother of your niece dies. Don't say something like this op.. Don't be a pretensions.", "Reddit is projecting, lol. I think you asked this question to the wrong people. Maybe try r/mommit for adult input.", "Wow. So you\u2019re passively wishing death on your SIL over this. I think we understand why your niece is acting so awful.", "Did she learn to bully others from you?", "[removed]", "Thank you! I was having a very hard time trying to understand the family dynamics of it all. Oh man, that's even worse if both the niece's parents are deceased and she has to live with her grandparents. Poor girl. I'm in my thirties and I still can't imagine life without my parents.", "We have had other problems with her, bullying kids at school eversince her dad(my brother) passed away 2 years ago. I understand my SIL is upset ok? I really get it but there is no way I'm going to exclude my niece from this trip my parents who are her legal guardians are trying their best to help my niece meanwhile I just want to make sure she is happy\n\nHere is her comment.", "Tbh it\u2019s not on op to punish her niece for the bullying regardless.", "Your still misunderstanding. Nieces mother is also dead. Op's parents are raising niece.", "The parents are dead. That\u2019s the background for both the niece\u2019s behavior and the reason for the trip. This really needs to be in the main post.", "If I found out one of my younger relatives was bullying someone to this extent, I'd cancel the invite and tell them that until they can start acting appropriately that they won't be going anywhere with me. I have no time for bullies, whether they are my blood relation or not.", "Oh, so why do people ban bully kids all the time from using a car, curfew, or cancel a party/trip as a punish for bullying? Bc, you know, it's nothing to do with that bullying?", "You're right but at the moment the options are, \"exclude niece\" which she has said she won't do, exclude stepniece which she is trying to do and is the wrong move or not go at all because she has already said she may as well cancel the whole thing if she's only taking nephew.", "They aren\u2019t stepsisters. I don\u2019t know why SIL isn\u2019t talking to niece\u2019s mom though. That\u2019s a lot more appropriate than telling aunt not to take niece on a trip to honour niece\u2019s father. \n\nAunt is not the parent and it\u2019s not her job to parent and she lacks the authority to parent. Niece has a mom; SIL should be talking to her.\n\nIt may have been reasonable for SIL to ask not to have the trip or keep niece from the trip if it was literally any other trip but one to honour niece\u2019s dead father. However, requesting that a child be removed from a trip to honour their dead parent so your kid, who had no connection to that parent, won\u2019t have to deal with actual mourner, is absurd and incredibly callous and entitled. I get why SIL feels the way she does, but this isn\u2019t a normal trip just for fun.\n\nESH. Aunt for lacking empathy, not caring that her niece is a bully, and trying to minimize the bullying behavior. SIL for asking a non-parent to parent and demanding the mourner be removed from a trip to honour her father.", "SIL is not niece\u2019s mom. SIL called up aunt and asked that niece be barred from a trip to honour niece\u2019s dead father, which is absurd on three accounts:\n\n1) SIL should be calling mom\n\n2) It is absurd to suggest removing the mourner from a trip to honour their dead parent\n\n3) step-niece just entered the family and has no connection to the deceased whom the trip is intended to honour\n\nI get the feeling that SIL doesn\u2019t grasp what the trip is about, because it\u2019s obvious that there\u2019s no point in the trip if niece doesn\u2019t go. And it\u2019s an absurd ask if she does know.\n\nAlso, why is she reaching out to aunt and not mom?", "OP isn't actively helping. She's spending time with family members. Another kid was forced into that time. Then, she was told to exclude the orphan in favor of the interloper. The trip and the bullying aren't connected except by the SIL, who weirdly insisted her kid take her bully's place on orphan-special-auntie time. That's SIL playing the long game.", "Her dad passed away 2 years ago her mom passed away 5 years ago", "Thank you. Finally. I say leave the step-cousin out of it. Give the niece one-on-one time. Seriously, Reddit isn't accounting for a grieving child struggling. The level of bullying is critical, too. Mean words or pig's blood? All this should be investigated and addressed. \n\nBut the step-niece had no business being on the trip in the first place. It's gross that they asked, given the circumstances. If SIL didn't want her kid exposed, she should've declined. But forcing the issue with an aunt trying to make the best and help kid have some joy?

Or just lack cognitive reasoning skills?", "Just a 411 but, the ringleader which your niece sounds like she is, DOES dictate to their lackeys who to abuse. If your niece is coming up with the who, what, when, where and how hard then she is culpable.

I\u2019ve been on family trips with extended family that I don\u2019t know too well, and it sucked. No one was comfortable enough for it to feel natural and I was just nervous the whole time. Now if you continue to avoid this girl for the sake of her not being blood-related, without her being an AH herself, then yeah you suck. I do think being on this trip with your niece and nephew gives you an opportunity to see what\u2019s going on at home with them, and if your niece is bullying your step niece, to explain why that\u2019s wrong and if there\u2019s a reason (aka a mean stepmother, as we\u2019ve seen in so many other posts).

You for not considering that the bullying is true, your niece for potentially bullying your step niece, your brother who clearly isn\u2019t handling a blended family well and hasn\u2019t taken the proper steps to help his grieving kids, and the step mother who is trying to force your niece away and screaming at you for it", "Its not a big enough difference for the OP since he was ok with her going.   \n\n> so I decided to take her as well. \n\nI would had never allowed a person to a family \"tradition\" that the only relationship was that I only knew the person for 3 months (eg coworker, friend etc).", "Clearly the other punishments aren't working if she has been bullying others at school for 2 years as you said.\n\nYou can't control the punishments she gets at home, but you could make her aware that due to her bullying others, including her cousin, she isn't welcome on the trip this year.
