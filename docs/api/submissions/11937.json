OP I think you need to sit down and talk to step niece, before making any final decisions on anything, it feels as if you have gotten drug into the middle of something that you may not have all the facts to.", "NTA. SIL sounds way too entitled and unhinged to be bluntly trusted, therefore I'd take SIL's words with a grain of salt. Step niece wanted to come, she would not if she were uncomfortable around your niece. If girls indeed have something going on between them at school, a fun family trip can be a bonding experience and possibility to get to know each other.", "Your step-niece would need consent of her parents to go on this trip, so it's not your decision. Her parents might want to look into that bullying situation because it doesn't sound as though they have resolved it. Finally, if the step-niece's mother is that crazy and unwilling to have a civil conversation, then you might have dodged a bullet.", "ESH. This is a big mess. I have 2 nieces myself, and I would absolutely not reward them with a trip if I heard they were being a bully. However, I also could not take one and not the other. I feel like the mother should have minded her business. You will now never know if this trip could have been a good bonding experience for the girls...", "ESH. Your SIL for making a demand that was pretty damn entitled. You for not even blinking at the fact that your niece was a bully. That probably deserves a moment's thought and a talk with her parents, not just brushing it under the carpet.", "NAH.  But sit both of them down together and see if this issue can be resolved.", "I\u2019m going with ESH except for step niece. Clearly your niece has had a rough time of it but that\u2019s no excuse for being a bully. And, by your own admission, she has been a bully for a long time now and no punishment or talking to her has made her stop. This is where you come in. You have the chance to try to mould her into a better person. But you are choosing not to - not your problem ey. Multi generational AHs in this family. \n\nYour new SIL shouldn\u2019t have \u2018expected\u2019 you to cancel your trip.

This is not about you taking the niece for the trip instead of the stepniece, this is about you taking the niece for a trip at all despite knowing she has behavioral issues. I get that you're not her parents, so you can't discipline her. But you can say \"you should improve your behavior if you want me to take you to trips\" to show that you wouldn't put up with it, and just take your nephew. But that's the crux of the problem I think - you would put up with it. The bullying is not a big issue for you so she gets a pass because you're not personally affected/she's your niece. Hence my ESH.", "Thinking about it some more and I am surprised you did not first check with your step niece what she wants to do. It seems like she did want to go, even when she knew your niece was going. Now she's just going to hear from her mum that you're excluding her, and if SIL is behaving this erratically, she might not be truthful about the reason why. That could really hurt your step niece, OP, and aggravate the bullying. I suggest you reach out and touch base and get to the truth of the matter before you exclude her.", "So, stepniece was eager to come on this trip, despite this supposed bullying? But now her mother calls to ditch niece, meanwhile acting like a big fat bully herself? I don't know what's going on there, but this doesn't add up. She can keep her daughter at home, that's for her to decide. She doesn't get to bully you into ditching your niece. NTA.\n\nETA: I'm not denying niece is bullying stepniece, and something needs to be done about that. I just don't see OP taking stepniece, a girl she hardly knows, on a trip. What problem does that solve?  Stepniece coming on the trip should never even have been on the table.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, OP\u2019s step niece asked to come. That\u2019s not the behaviour I\u2019d typically associate with a victim of bullying, to ask to go on a trip with their bully, so I assume that either SIL is lying for whatever reason or OP\u2019s invite was what triggered the bullying in the first place (niece perhaps wanting to go without her stepsister). In the case of the latter, then YTA but I really don\u2019t understand why people are basing their judgements off one person\u2019s claims. Like, where is the story from the niece and the step niece?", "Okay whew I\u2019ve read your responses and imma get the rating out of the way YTA.\n\nYou really are enabling her bullying, it\u2019s basically a slap in your stepnieces face that yet another thing is ruined by your niece. Your niece is winning, she\u2019s getting her way again. Now I\u2019ve seen some responses of yours where you say she\u2019s already a bully in school and other people are taking care of it to help her but you just want her to \u201cbe happy\u201d.\n\nThis is so contridictive, it\u2019s like someone trying to help someone get over an addiction but another person (Aka you) are feeding the addict their addiction behind their backs.\n\nYou need to have a talk with her guardians. You may not think your influences impact your niece just because you are her parent but that\u2019s not true. As long as she has one person telling her that bullying people is okay let\u2019s go have fun she\u2019s gonna keep doing it no matter what her guardians are doing. You are showing her it\u2019s okay through your actions and how it\u2019s okay to ruin something for someone else.\n\nYou need to set boundaries for your treats and your niece and only give her rewards when she actually makes progress becoming a better person. It\u2019s the only way to save her from becoming awful in the future", "What the ever loving fuck is wrong with people in the comments saying YTA? OP is NTA.\n\nStep-niece's mother demanded that the niece be excluded from a trip that OP is planning. That was not her demand to make. If she doesn't want the girls being together, then that is her prerogative, but she doesn't get to dictate shit to OP. \n\nFurthermore, it is not OP's job to parents these children. Yes, the bullying needs to be addressed, but that is up to the niece's parents / guardians.", "NTA. As someone who comes from a family of a lot step sibling/half siblings, we all went on different trips/vacations depending on family. My step-extended family would take my step sisters on trips all the time without taking me and I went on trips they didn\u2019t go on. In my friends families where they had step siblings the same thing happened so. I get trying to be inclusive, but I think that\u2019s hard in step family sometimes.", "I\u2019m gonna say NAH. It sucks that your niece is a bully, she should be punished for that, it\u2019s not your job. If both your brother and SIL were aligned on her not going that\u2019s one thing, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. I don\u2019t blame her mother for going to bat for her, but she\u2019s got a husband problem if she\u2019s having to yell at you about it. \n\nThat said, you don\u2019t really seem to give all that much of a damn about your step niece\u2026 or your nieces behavior frankly. A good compromise may be you doing something special one-on-one with your step niece. If you continue to treat her differently, the situation isn\u2019t going to improve.\n\nI\u2019d also say as an aunt, you can absolutely call out your niece on her shit behavior from a place of love. 2 years of being a bully is too long as a kid, even if you\u2019re grieving.", "NAH\n\nI agree that it's not your place to punish your niece. I don't think you are enabling your niece like some others seem to think. Your niece seems to have some problems and it can be good for her to have an aunt who doesn't is on her back. \n\nI understand that the decision to exclude your stepniece was taken in the heat of the argument. It's understandable, but wasn't right. Now your stepniece is punished for something her mother did. The whole discusion went the wrong way, and you could have handled it better.\n\nI would apologize to the Sil for excluding your stepniece, invite her again and promise to keep an eye on those two. The trip could be a bounding moment for stepniece and niece. They are still family to each other.

I don't understand how the mom thought that she could get you involved in punishing your brother's kid. Even if your niece is being an AH, that still doesn't mean she can require you to change plans to exclude her.", "ESH, at least the adults. Has anyone of you thought to talk to the kids about this?

Anger often replaces emotions like grief, sadness and desperation. If your niece was my kid I would get her into therapy asap.", "NTA.  You've only got the word of an angry mother about the bullying.  That's a lot of gray area open for interpretation. \nThis is an established trip that the same lady is thrusting her kid into.

I think getting both sets of parents together and telling them to sort it out is probably appropriate.

Tell sister in law to straighten things out with your niece's parents.", "Oof, OP. Very, very few pains compare to your child being bullied. You feel powerless, you are forced to watch as your child is methodically tortured, but no one seems to intervene or take you seriously.

So yeah I think YTA.", "ESH. You should not be expected to uninvite your niece from the trip just based on hearing a one sided story. Your SIL is understandably upset if this is happening but has no right to scream at you and make demands. \n\nBut it's a bit of an A-H move to just automatically exclude your stepniece just because her mom is yelling at you. It also sounds like you didn't even think of including your stepniece until she found out about the trip from her cousins.

Maybe the niece wasn\u2019t active in that bullying and just a sad follower or maybe the step-niece wanted to become closer to her by forming this memory together. You would obviously make sure they all behaved.

You offered a trip which included going on said trip with specific people, and if the SIL didn't like who was going, she and her daughter could decline.\n\nThat said, maybe have a chat with your niece about being nice to others.

Ultimately it probably is better for her not to go on the trip, as it is clear that if anything happened under your supervision you would not have this poor girl\u2019s back and seem to believe she should put up with any ill treatment simply because she isn\u2019t blood related or she hasn\u2019t known you as long- which is incredibly sad. \n\nNo you don\u2019t need to resolve this problem - that is the responsibility of both sets of parents, but this is still a child in your community. You could still treat and talk about her with an ounce of empathy and respect.", "Wow based on your comments YTA no question asked.

But they will be family for the foreseeable future. The adulte in their lives should behave like adults and help them overcome this issue and learn from it.", "NTA.

The bullying is not for OP to punish - which doesn\u2019t mean she can\u2019t have a conversation with niece about it, but she\u2019s allowed to spend time with her niece as she always as she always has.", "If YOUR niece is bullying HER kid, maybe YOU should act like an adult about it.", "ESH. She should have just pulled her daughter from the trip instead of telling you what to do. You suck because you seem to have such a callous attitude to bullying and that your niece is a bully.", "YTA.  You've known for over 2 years that your niece is a bully and yet you still reward her with a trip and punish the victim.  That makes you just as much of a bully.", "YTA. Regardless of the tradition behind this trip, you already invited your step-niece but then un-invite her for being bullied - something she has no control over - and the only justification you give her mom is \"my trip, my rules.\" Perhaps SIL jumped to an extreme solution because she was upset, but instead of finding a solution that works for everyone you invited, you went with the one that was easiest for *you*.", "jesus christ some of these comments are unreal. you are NTA OP. i find it curious that your step-niece is the one who asked to come on the trip, but her mom made a huge drama about it and tried to get you to uninvite the person the trip is actually for. sounds like some meddling and i\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t cave.", "NTA, a lot of people seem to be missing the fact that this trip is for your niece and nephew. People shouldn't expect you to punish your niece to appease your step niece's mom. Tbf, it was ur step niece who ask to be included, and u were gracious enough to extend an invite. But the trip was never about your step niece. \n\n\n\nI'm guessing that if either niece or nephew were unavailable the trip date would be moved or reworked to accommodate both of them, as the trip is for them. \n\n\n\nPeople telling you, that you should exclude your niece are being unreasonable, and their expectations that you are the person that should parent her are weird. She has parents and they will dole out punishments as they see fit. \n\n\n\nYour decision was correct. Again, the trip was never about your step niece.", "YTA for rewarding a bully. You do you but it isn't a good look. It also reinforce to your niece that being a bully is perfectly fine.", "YTA. Please take this response with a grain of salt. I am only saying YTA because it seems, from the post, that you made this decision just to spite SIL which would not be fair to Step Niece. It looks like you only had SIL's side of the story which could be exaggerated or missing details. You could have tried to have some conversations with the children and get their sides of the story before making a decision. What step Niece is calling bullying might be familial teasing. It just seems like a very rushed decision.", "NTA. Your SIL put you on the spot, and forced you to make a rash decision.  The issue that I see here, is that this trip is a tradition that you do every year. It\u2019s unfair to tell you what you will or will not be doing with your trip.  Your niece and nephew likely look forward to this trip, and spending time with you. \n\nIt was generous for you to invite SIL\u2019s daughter in the first place. You weren\u2019t obligated to do that. I wonder why, if your step-niece is so badly bullied, why she would want to go?  Your step-niece is old enough, this should have been a conversation to have with her involved - not your SIL just yelling at you. You were screwed either way. If you take step-niece, and exclude your niece, that could cause resentment and escalate the bullying. If you exclude the step-niece and take your niece, it looks like you\u2019re playing favorites, and your step-niece could be extremely hurt - thinking you excluded her for unknown reasons. \n\nIdeally you should have spoken with your brother and SIL before inviting your step-niece.  But here we are. So now what should have happened was SIL should have filled you in on the bullying (without cornering you) and then had a conversation with her daughter about what she wanted to do. Did she really feel comfortable being alone with niece? Why did she want to go? What does she want to do? Together, SIL, and daughter should have figured out what concerns they had and how step-niece wanted to proceed, then had a private conversation with you about it.  SIL needs to be a parent and get involved. Not back you into a corner and demand a solution. This is a complicated situation, and quite frankly, your step-niece is old enough to decide if she wants to put herself in that situation or not. \n\nIf step-niece truly doesn\u2019t attend, then you should take that time with your niece to explain how her actions are hurting people, and talk about the bullying, and how she\u2019s feeling.  It could be a good learning moment for her.", "You are in a hard situation where someone will be upset no matter what you do.  However, I can't vote you the ahole to make decisions on your own trip.
