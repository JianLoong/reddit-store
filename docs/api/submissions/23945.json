Nobody would think they're the asshole in this case except a completely brainwashed person and OP doesn't scan as brainwashed.", "What a horrible thing for you to say!", "It's almost like people get upset when viciously bullied, especially by family", "People, like you, who think they should \"decide\" who their child is romantically attracted to should not have children. Conversion therapy is terrible and you'd feel the same if parents took their straight child to be converted to being gay - but you only have enough empathy to only use it for straight people probably.", "you should try sitting down and being quiet.", "Do you want his son to die?", "I'm sorry what?", "can the homophobes sit down and be quiet? no one cares about what you have to say.", "Help? What help? Did you receive help or do you choose to be straight? If you do then I\u2019ve got news for you buddy you ain\u2019t straight \ud83d\ude02 \nYou\u2019re a classic closet case.", "This!!!!! Super important!!!", "This is the best. Having you stand up for him is going down in his good books forever. Tell him you kicked them out!", "Tell us which US states are trying to pass laws against calling someone a racist or homophobe.  That would be a significant, if actually true.", "I was going to say, not only is OP NTA, not only is he a great dad, but if anything, he under-reacted.  Didn\u2019t appreciate their comment?   I\u2019d never speak to them again.", "Mine responded with \u201cAt least you\u2019re not going to come home pregnant\u201d. I think *that* was her greatest worry my entire teenage life. \n\nThough of course she already knew. Mums always know. Witches, the lot of \u2018em!", "Really? Because there's only one party advancing anti-LGBT bills in statehouses around the country and it's not the democrats.", "Let those same people find out a drag queen *talked* to said child or that the lgbt admit *we exist* to this kid and watch the pearls explode from how tight they clutch them", "The fact he called his dad right away too. He KNEW dad wasn\u2019t gonna stand for it and felt confident and comfortable enough to tell him immediately. OP is doing an amazing job", "And just to add: When it concerns family, it can be really helpful to just get an outside perspective, even if it so seems obvious one way or another.", "It\u2019s really hard to reconcile. \n\n\u201cThese people loved, supported, devoted their lives to me for 30+ years. And I cut them out due to ONE bad experience?\u201d\n\nThat shit gets in your head. You feel guilty. It feels like you\u2019re throwing away a lifetime over\u2026a day. \n\nIt gets easier to excuse the bad behavior. \n\nI never had to cut off my parents, but I did with a sibling. What she did to me was just too much to let slide. \n\nAnd the only way I was able to do it was by setting a limit with myself, that the ball was in her court if she ever was truly apologetic and wanted to make it right. \n\nIt took\u20267-8 years of no contact, but then she finally admitted to the harm she caused and was willing to fix it. And we have a polite relationship now. \n\nOP is right to stand their ground on this. But I 100% sympathize. It\u2019s an absolute mind fuck with family dynamics like this.", "This.", "Sometimes people need to be reminded they did the right thing. Sometimes people can live in areas or amongst others when even doing the right thing sounds wrong if your told your wrong often enough.\n\nThink of all the gay people, trans people, minority people who struggle to this day with their identity because their microcosm tells them they are wrong. This father is trying to prevent that by taking on that brunt of hatred.\n\nIt\u2019s ok to want to be recognized for a good thing, or to seek validation for a good thing sometimes.\n\nNTA OP - keep being a good parent", "This is not a stranger on the street calling him a jerk. It's his own family, who he thought supported his son, calling him a jerk. It's people he loves, and cares about, and it's not easy to come to terms with the fact that the parents he loved could be this utterly cruel to their 15yo grandson who they supposedly loved.\n\nRationally, he probably knows he is not the AH. But humans don't work JUST on rationality, we work on emotions too. And from an emotional POV, being called a jerk repeatedly by people you love will make you question yourself.", "Being concerned for him is bad?", "I wouldn't be worried about this person having kids. More like cries about being single and acts like it is their choice and not because they are racist, sexist and homophobic \ud83d\ude07\n\nI think we can all get the vibe that OP would never listen to statements coming from a tempid room temperature IQ.", "Well I feel like what I typed is pretty clear. Or are you just baffled to hear that there\u2019s opinions differing from your own?", "If he didn\u2019t want the opinions of random strangers he probably shouldn\u2019t have made a post asking for just that. Being a normal person in a normal relationship is statistically the best possible way to live a long, healthy, and happy life.", "people are allowed to have feelings. finding out your family is actually a bunch of homophobes is something most normal people would be upset about", "Oh, honey, no.", "Definitely not lmao", "no, but you choose to be an asshole.", "Gross comment.", "I'm just baffled as to why there is such blatant homophobia. I'm open to other opinions, just not hateful ones such as this.", "let's get this shit straight. there is *nothing* abnormal about being gay. take your homophobic bullshit somewhere else.", "Hate? When did I say I hate them? I feel bad for them and only hope they can get some help and overcome that derangement. That lifestyle, statistically, is fraught with disease, depression(among other mental illnesses), drug addiction, and rather low life expectancy. I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to go through that. Every person, especially a child, that can be saved from it is a very good thing.", "You\u2019re doing a fine job of insulting yourself by your words. Be gone with you.", "Loving someone doesn't make you deranged and it isn't a mental illness. Just let people live their life and be happy. Love is love and who cares who you are attracted to.", "You must be a wee bit angry if you have to comment twice. Cope, I guess?", "Well like I said, living that lifestyle is statistically just about the least likely lifestyle you could live and still be happy. High rates of suicide and drug abuse don\u2019t exactly scream \u201cyeah this is a happy normal lifestyle\u201d.", "No, I loathe bullies. Be gone.", "Your statistics and argument are severely flawed. A lot of the high suicide and drug rates have a lot to do with how people like you treat us. I know a lot of happy, gay people. The world would be a better place if you let people live their lives in peace. Goodbye."]}
