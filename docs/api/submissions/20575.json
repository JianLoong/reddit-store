{"id": 20575, "submission_id": "14itr1n", "title": "AITA for going on vacation without my children from a previous marriage?", "selftext": "(Throwaway for obvious reasons) \n\n\nMy ex-wife Kate and I have two kids (Mike, 16 and Abby, 14). We had a turbulent marriage and split for many reasons. It wasn\u2019t amicable and I had to fight for custody. \n\n\nKate and I both remarried. She didn\u2019t have children with her new husband. I have three (9F, 7F, 5M) kids with my wife and also gained a stepdaughter (19). My stepdaughter\u2019s father left after he found out my wife was pregnant, so she never knew her father. When I came into their lives I took on the role of a father figure. As far as blended families go, I am really lucky that we are all happy. My stepdaughter and I have good relationship and Mike and Abby love their siblings from my wife. \n\n\nThe only person that is against my family is my Kate. My wife is black and this has been a point of contention since the beginning. Especially the fact that my wife is a very dark-skinned black woman is problematic to her. Kate, her husband and I are very white. Kate hates my wife and, especially, my stepdaughter (her bio-dad is also black). Kate\u2019s racism was one of many factors of our divorce. She has been mostly silent on my biracial kids even though they present as black. Thankfully Mike and Abby haven\u2019t taken over her racism. \n\n\nBecause of this, Kate has been on a crusade, trying to make my families life as difficult as possible. It came to a head last week. We were planning to go on a vacation abroad with the entire family. Including Mike and Abby. Everyone was looking forward to it. Especially, my stepdaughter was looking forward to it. But Kate wouldn\u2019t sign the documents that would allow Mike and Abby to travel abroad (because they are minors). Everyone was really disappointed. It would be the first vacation abroad for my three bio-kids with my wife.\n\n\nI then decided to go and book the vacation anyway but without Mike and Abby. Understandably, they were not happy. Normal I don\u2019t badmouth Kate in front of them, but I told them its because of her that they can\u2019t go. \n\n\nThis caused Kate to become really angry, saying I was prioritising my new family, and abandoning Mike and Abby. She somehow placed the blame for all this on my stepdaughter. Saying my stepdaughter was taking their father away. Also calling me a \u201crace traitor\u201d, which didn\u2019t make sense. \n\n\nThis unleashed a shitstorm with everyone of our friends weighing in, with some saying I am an asshole. Mike and Abby are pissed at me for not going on vacation, and place the blame on me, after I deflected blame away from my stepdaughter. \n\n\nKate calls me an asshole for going on vacation. I am beginning to think booking the vacation was a mistake, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687718656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14itr1n/aita_for_going_on_vacation_without_my_children/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This screams as an attempt to alienate you from your first kids.", "ESH\n\nYour ex is obviously wrong for her harmful, racist views. She is enjoying pulling the puppet strings while she causes chaos in your new family, no matter how much it harms the children you share. Shame on her. \n\nBut (and I say this gently) **you are at also fault here for booking a vacation that two of your six children cannot go on and then expecting them to be fine and dandy with the idea of being left out while you take the rest of their siblings on vacay,** no matter whose fault it is.\n\nThe correct thing to do here is to cancel the vacation for the entire family, and book a new lovely vacation somewhere in the country where you live that EVERYONE can go on. There will be plenty of opportunity for international travel in just a few short years when your children you share with Kate are legally adults.\n\nDon't make the mistake of dividing your family by taking some of them on a huge fun vacation and punishing your two children from your first marriage because of your ex's actions. They will not forget this, and the resentment they feel may poison their relationships with their siblings.", "NTA. Kate is a racist and her kids should know.", "NTA but if there's any way for you to have less contact with Kate/more time with Mike and Abby, I'd pursue it. It is incredibly toxic that their mom is being racist towards their stepmom and stepsiblings, and they're still young enough that you need to do everything you can to protect them from her. If Mike and Abby literally can't go on the international trip, I'd try and arrange a domestic family trip too, so they still get to have a vacation with their dad and family.", "NTA\n\nDo you have a case for parental alienation? If not, time to start collecting evidence to get your kids away from an unhinged racist.", "NTA and your kids deserve to know the truth. Mom would not let you go. Take it up with her. End of story.", "INFO: could you not get some kind of waiver through the family court system? I\u2019ve heard of people getting the court to sign off on them taking their kid on vacation when their ex wouldn\u2019t ok it.", "INFO: Did you talk to Kate about getting her permission before you told the kids you wanted to do this trip? \n\nNTA, but could you travel domestically so they can be included? I don't blame Mike and Abby for being upset at being left out. And it is categorically NOT your fault that their mother won't allow them to go, but teenagers aren't always rational. They can know that it's not your fault, but still feel upset and like they're being replaced if you do this amazing trip without them.", "immediately no. there\u2019s absolutely no way you would be TA when your ex wife is a *racist*. plus she\u2019s the reason the kids couldn\u2019t go lol. liar liar pants on fire for her. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou booked the vacation and (I assume paid for the vacation). Kate is the one preventing Mike and Abby from going. They are old enough to understand that both parents\u2019 permission is required for minors to travel internationally. \n\nYou could have avoided this by picking a domestic vacation. If you are in the U.S. there are a lot of great destinations that don\u2019t require a passport including Caribbean islands (Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands). But that isn\u2019t where you wanted to go, you wanted to go internationally, which is great, but it gave Kate the chance to do this.", "Your ex never cited safety concerns with the trip, just race concerns - which means you\u2019re asking us if your racist ex\u2019s racist behavior makes her the AH or not.\n\nShe\u2019s the AH. Your kids are disappointed, but you were right to tell them exactly what was preventing their travel. Racism.\n\nNTA.", "NTA but make sure you document this in case anything comes up in court. Your kids deserve to know what kind of mother they have. I would suggest planning a nice domestic trip with them soon just so they are reassured of their part in your family. Divorce sucks, but your ex is really making it worse. Ugh!", "NTA - If you don't take the vacation, Kate will have effectively ruined it for eight people instead of just two. You can make it up to Mike and Abby in some other way when you come back.", "I mean thsres racist and then there's n@zi level racism which is what \"kate\" clearly is.\n\nYou're NTA. We all know \"kate\" is on sooooo many levels. \n\nInfo though in terms of custody - I'd look at what is actually said in that and then raose how the ex is being toward you and your new wife & family, how she's effectively trying to cause that kind of shit for you and your kids", "What \u201cdocuments\u201d do minors need to travel abroad? Is this a divorced parents thing? All my kids ever needed was their passports", "NTA You tried to book the vacation with them but your ex wife didn\u2019t let them go. That\u2019s on her and her racism. I like that you don\u2019t bad mouth your ex wife to them but my older half brother was in a situation like your older kids. My dad lost his son basically because his ex wife was so horrible and hated my father and my mother so much. My oldest brother and father are working on their relationship but the damage has been done. \nI think the kids are old enough to talk about the reason why they didn\u2019t go. It\u2019s not bad mouthing because you\u2019re telling the truth. Tell them their mother didn\u2019t want them to go and refused to sign the paper. \nI think you should spend more time with the older kids and work on those relationships after the vacation. You should take them for a special time with you and really bond with them", "NTA. Your ex is really toxic - I hope you're documenting her behaviour. And your kids are old enough to know that she refused them permission to travel.", "NTA \n\nI hope your kids (with the ex) just learnt a valuable lesson about their mom. You need to make them understand that she's the reason they're not on this trip.", "NTA\n\nAt first glance of the title, I would have said you were, but their mother is the only reason they can\u2019t go. No one should expect a human from enjoying a vacation because their ex is being a complete ah by preventing the kids from going.", "ESH. Your ex is worse, because she's using your kids as weapons.\n\nBut you kind of are, too, for allowing her to do it.", "NTA.  Kate won't sign the paperwork and there's nothing you can do about that.  Your vacation was planned and why should the rest of your loved ones suffer the consequences of Kate's actions?", "I hate these kind of misleading titles. Nta you are trying to take them and can\u2019t. That isn\u2019t on you.", "Your NTA the only one who is, is ex wife is but i still think you shouldn't have booked the out of country vacation because your other children are teens they don't think rational for them it just seems you choose your new family above them \n\n\nWhat i think you should have done is either go in a Trip close by so they can join or waited longer and take there mother to court for those documents i don't know how it's in your country but we're i come from thats a possibility", "NTA Your the only reasonable one in this drama between your x and kids with her.
