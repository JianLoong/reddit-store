We had a turbulent marriage and split for many reasons. It wasn\u2019t amicable and I had to fight for custody. \n\n\nKate and I both remarried. She didn\u2019t have children with her new husband. I have three (9F, 7F, 5M) kids with my wife and also gained a stepdaughter (19). My stepdaughter\u2019s father left after he found out my wife was pregnant, so she never knew her father. When I came into their lives I took on the role of a father figure. As far as blended families go, I am really lucky that we are all happy. My stepdaughter and I have good relationship and Mike and Abby love their siblings from my wife. \n\n\nThe only person that is against my family is my Kate. My wife is black and this has been a point of contention since the beginning. Especially the fact that my wife is a very dark-skinned black woman is problematic to her. Kate, her husband and I are very white. Kate hates my wife and, especially, my stepdaughter (her bio-dad is also black). Kate\u2019s racism was one of many factors of our divorce. She has been mostly silent on my biracial kids even though they present as black. Thankfully Mike and Abby haven\u2019t taken over her racism. \n\n\nBecause of this, Kate has been on a crusade, trying to make my families life as difficult as possible. It came to a head last week. We were planning to go on a vacation abroad with the entire family. Including Mike and Abby. Everyone was looking forward to it. Especially, my stepdaughter was looking forward to it. But Kate wouldn\u2019t sign the documents that would allow Mike and Abby to travel abroad (because they are minors). Everyone was really disappointed. It would be the first vacation abroad for my three bio-kids with my wife.\n\n\nI then decided to go and book the vacation anyway but without Mike and Abby. Understandably, they were not happy. Normal I don\u2019t badmouth Kate in front of them, but I told them its because of her that they can\u2019t go. \n\n\nThis caused Kate to become really angry, saying I was prioritising my new family, and abandoning Mike and Abby. She somehow placed the blame for all this on my stepdaughter. Saying my stepdaughter was taking their father away. Also calling me a \u201crace traitor\u201d, which didn\u2019t make sense. \n\n\nThis unleashed a shitstorm with everyone of our friends weighing in, with some saying I am an asshole. Mike and Abby are pissed at me for not going on vacation, and place the blame on me, after I deflected blame away from my stepdaughter. \n\n\nKate calls me an asshole for going on vacation. I am beginning to think booking the vacation was a mistake, AITA?", "created_utc": 1687718656, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14itr1n/aita_for_going_on_vacation_without_my_children/", "score": 5962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should have spoken to them first to gage how they felt and whether doing this might cause an unrecognizable rift.\n\nNow you are stuck. I'm not excusing your ex for being vindictive but don't pretend that the ultimate cause of this situation wasn't that you communicated poorly the entire time and ended up in a completely predictable situation. Being divorced with children is hard, but your children should never be in the middle of it. The fact your ex is unpleasant doesn't give you the right to only consult her about removing the children from the country as an afterthought. Your failure to communicate put your kids in the middle of their parents dispute.

Yes, their mom is wrong, but don't be the dad who didn't stand by them. You need to change plans to something local that you all can do. \n\nAlso, it sounds like you might need to get ready for a court battle. Good luck.", "Soft YWBTA if you go without them. You can already see how badly they are taking it, and you haven't gone yet. Is it too late to change the trip to somewhere in-country? I know that isn't ideal as you wanted to go abroad, but it would solve your problem and everyone could go on vacation.", "YTA knowing your ex is hostile \nWhy would you playing overseas trip without having her permission in hand? And why can\u2019t you change to a different vacation to include everyone?", "INFO\n\nDid you tell the kids that you planned this vacation for them, but their mother refuses to sign the documents needed to let you go?\n\nIf you did, what are the kid's saying, how do they reach the conclusion that it's your fault.", "NTA\n\nBut you need to see your family law attorney again. \n\nYou also need to sit down with Mike and Abby and make the facts of the situation crystal clear. \n\n\"I would dearly love to take you on this vacation, as we always have before. Unfortunately, I can not take you without your Mom's express, written approval due to our custody agreement. Your mom is refusing to approve your travel because she believes that me marrying someone who is not white makes me a 'race traitor' and treating your siblings as equal considerations in our family is unaccpetable because they are Black. I'm so sorry she feels that way, but I can't change her mind, and I can't take you if she won't approve the travel.\" Then work on a special trip or event you can take just them to. \n\nI get that you don't want Kate to control your family choices, and you don't want to bad-mouth Kate. At some point, though, your children deserve to know the facts. Telling them that their Mom refuses to approve something and sharing the stated why, at least at these ages, is fairly reasonable.", "Light ESH. Kate is clearly a monster, but couldn\u2019t you have picked a vacation spot that didn\u2019t require her to sign off on paperwork? It was on you to solve around her bigotry so that all of your kids could be included.", "I would probably want to try to make the mom and kids meet with me somehow and in front of the kids beg the mom to let them come lmao but sometimes I\u2019m a jaded fken asshole.\n\nIf she said no\u2026 then honestly speaking as a mother I would plan something here that ALL of my kids could be a part of and let all of them know we will do some research and find out at what age they will be able to go abroad without their mothers consent.\n\nI would not go on this vacation without them.", "NTA -\nTell mike and Abby they can come if their mom signs off. You would love for them to come but their mom said no. The blame needs to be on Kate. They are old enough to understand their mom won\u2019t let them go so your hands are tied.", "Idk if this is possible but can you book the vacation to include them? Add the two additional travel and accommodation tickets or whatever. Then put the ball back in her court. They\u2019re welcome and they have a place on your trip, now it\u2019s really mom who won\u2019t let them go if she refuses to sign off. At least then the other kids would know you\u2019re trying and she\u2019s the hold up.", "Better move would have been to go to court and have a judge make your wife sign the papers. Just leaving Mike and Abby behind sucks.  YTA along with your ex.", "This! Document all of this OP - every conversation, dates, times, etc. The courts can use it as evidence. NTA. See if you can do something special for your older kids though. They need you too. Especially since their mom seems to be a spiteful bigot. Take them somewhere with just the three of you. \n\nEdit to add that a lot of custody arrangements limit distance a parent can take the kids. This includes out of state and international travel. Some even limit the miles you can go in state. The courts could easily deny permission too. There isn\u2019t a simple solution to this.\n\nEdit 2: I wanted to add that Kate is obviously engaging in emotional abuse. She\u2019s using the kids as ammo to harm their father and family. Abuse is my area of speciality. You don\u2019t give in to people like this. You\u2019d be emboldening her to cause further trouble, telling her that the manipulation works and that she can dictate what you can and cannot do OP.", "Yes.\n\nRacist mom is also using her children as a weapon to hurt OP.\n\nI hope OP is collecting evidence for an eventual custody battle.", "Yes.\n\nThe kids need to be told it was racist mom who refused to allow the trip.\n\nOP should explain the situation and promise to take them on an even better vacation when they turn 18.\n\nThat will rightfully put all the blame where it belongs, on racist mom.", "Agree here.

Mom doesn't want them to go - with no reason other than \"not with those people.\"\n\nNTA \n\nAny person who was used as a pawn should say the same. OP should go and enjoy.

The new wife is black and so are the resulting children", "no, but OP also wants a unified, happy family. he won't get that if he keeps pulling stunts like this. 4 more years and they all adults who can freely leave the country, in the meantime their are a ton of domestic places to travel that are even out of the mainland US.\n\n>I don't see how you get to the conclusion that OP will \"drop them\"\n\nits literally in the title lmao. He's leaving his two kids home while the entire rest of his family goes on a fancy international trip.", "This is a great idea.  While Puerto Rico is a part of the US, it does immerse you in another culture and has lots of great, easy-to-access travel options for families.  If you could go there with everybody instead of the original trip, that would work, but if it's a separate trip this is a good idea too.", "Thank you, the people in this thread are fucking insane.", "I'm sure they know.  Racism as blatant as this seems to be is hard to hide, especially as the mom is seemingly trying to make it all the stepdaughters fault. \n\nBeing unaware of racism is unfortunately a luxury only reserved for white people.  His younger kids are watching and clocking how he values and treats them vs his white family, and there is a good chance they are internalizing it as well.", "I think you and I have different understandings of what it means to \"drop\" someone.\n\nAnd purely speculatively, I wonder if OP planned a trip to to Africa or Asia, and that's the source of his ex's resistance. I mean it could be pure spite, but I could imagine a racist ex approving a trip to France but vetoing one to Ghana.", "Vacation is not abandonment", "Yeah it's not simple either way for sure. \n\nI think you have to separate the mum from the question here. It's not, is Kate the AH or is OP the AH. OP is really asking, is he the AH or are *Abby and Mike* the AHs.\n\nNo matter how you slice it, Kate is an unmitigated AH. The question for OP is about protecting all his kids and preserving his relationship with them. It seems to me that Abby and Mike's reaction is both understandable, and evidence that when OP chose to proceed from proposal to booking, *knowing Abby and Mike couldn't come*, he damaged that relationship. There weren't many good choices available to him, but I think the one he went with is one he'll regret for a long time.", "I get it could cater to her, I think though it may help to ensure his kids feel they are part of the family. Who cares if it caters to her a bit as it\u2019s not about her. It\u2019s about making sure the kids are ok and feel secure in their family.  \n\nThey are old enough which is why I have said he needs to be honest with them. Which if he is, doesn\u2019t matter that a second trip happens because they will know it\u2019s because of her which negates it catering to her.", "That's the stupidest thing you can do and the ex is taking full advantage. OP is fighting with two hands tied behind his back", "He\u2019s allowing their crazy mother to essentially punish them and keep them from going on vacation. If he wanted to take all of his kids on a vacation, he still could have. But he chose not to by keeping the international travel plan, leaving his older kids out, and effectively agreeing to exclude them. \n\nHis 3 youngest are all under the age of ten, they won\u2019t appreciate the difference between a domestic vacation and something abroad anyway.", "They probably go on vacation without him.", "Can I just interject a tiny bit of reality having grown up with almost no vacations that not having vacation doesn\u2019t, in fact, ruin any lives?\n\nThat being said\u2026I feel so badly for the two excluded children that will pay for the sins of their mother.

That\u2019s a completely different situation. If he\u2019d already booked a vacation and then found out his older kids couldn\u2019t attend, that\u2019s one thing. But he literally had to make the conscious decision to take a family vacation knowing that 2 of his children couldn\u2019t go on. \n\n\nHe found out his 2 oldest children wouldn\u2019t be permitted to leave the country, shrugged his shoulders, and booked the trip his 2 kids couldn\u2019t join the rest of the family for. He\u2019s literally allowing the family to move on without them, by no fault of their own. The kids don\u2019t deserve to be left out just because they\u2019re mom is controlling.", "How is proceeding with the already established plans, in response to your ex trying to torpedo them, weaponing your children?", "I care less about booking than I do about whether the wife and other four kids knew it was being planned.  I'm guessing yes, they did.  And even if not, they are still being shortchanged for no fault of their own, giving Kate power over their lives.   \n\nThe feelings of the two are important, but not the feelings of the five other people involved?\n\n> The kids don\u2019t deserve to be left out just because they\u2019re mom is controlling.\n\nThis is correct, but it's out of OP's control that they are being left out of international travel. That's all Mom.\n\nHe can take them on a domestic trip separately.", "There\u2019s no rebooking, he booked the international trip AFTER he found out they couldn\u2019t go", "ESH.\n\nA lot of people are acting like there is only two sides here: either Kate is the AH and you should go on holiday w/o the children or Kate is in the right and it's fine that she's doing this. \n\nThe third (imo correct) side is that Kate absolutely is an AH, and what she is doing is petty, cruel and bigoted. But going on holiday without two of your children is also wrong. I can't imagine how it must feel for your mother to stop you from going on holiday and then your father to go without you anyway. Your children will not be damaged or harmed by not going on an international holiday, many people (including me) manage just fine without it. And when they're adults, you can do a foreign trip without Kate's influence. \n\nYou're not bending to Kate's will, you're keeping your family together.", "Dude. Blended families can go on vacation without some kids.\nI\u2019m sure the two bio kids go on vacations with their mom.", "So if she never allows them to go on vacation with him, his other children are never allowed to go on vacation?

She\u2019s punishing them and in your mind that ok!", "He\u2019s punished his two kids because of their mom\u2026WHO HE MARRIED AND CHOSE TO HAVE CHILDREN WITH. He is the one that gave them a crappy mom. He put his kids in this situation, and he\u2019s allowing his two oldest children to be alienated from their blended family. He\u2019s just as guilty that his kids are being left out. He booked the travel after he knew.", "OP is the one who married a racist and had kids with her. He knew what he was getting into, their children did not.", "No, OP is still their father. Unless OP wants to give up parental rights to his kids, Kate\u2019s behavior affects the entire family. He will alienate his children if he continues to exclude them. OP could have easily planned a different vacation to allow ALL of his children to go on the trip.", "He would still need permission to take the kids out of state. And I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s sucks for his two oldest but no it isn\u2019t fair for the entire family to have to constantly plan their family vacations and experiences around a hateful bigot.

They should suffer for Kate?  He needs to give them the best life he can give them, which means not kowtowing to Kate's over-reach.", "I don't believe anybody is \"defending the wrong\" or empowering the spiteful ex. OP is *legally required* to have her permission before taking the kids abroad. He doesn't have that. Yes, their mom is the one excluding them, and since that's the case, OP should instead take the family somewhere else, that way they *won't* be excluded. If he insists on going abroad anyway, then he is contributing to the exclusion. It's unfortunate, but that's the reality.", "America is freaking huge. If they live in California, they can go to New England/NYC, and vice versa. OP even brought up in comments that Puerto Rico was a viable destination. It\u2019s not the end of the world if they can\u2019t go to Europe or Asia for another few years. Most Americans have to wait until their kids are that old for a vacation like that; it\u2019s a privilege. In most cases, it\u2019s a financial thing that isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s fault\u2014but because it can be attributed to one person\u2019s fault, then it\u2019s totally fine for OP to book a vacation that excludes his children? That doesn\u2019t make any sense to me, and I guarantee it will make less sense to his kids. If a school bully got ahold of one of the kid\u2019s passports and burned it, wouldn\u2019t OP be clearly TA for booking the vacation anyway even if they know a replacement won\u2019t get sent in time? A third party is preventing a kid from going and OP went \u201coh well, I wanna go abroad, sorry bud.\u201d I don\u2019t understand how that\u2019s different.", "I actually don't think he's asking if the Abby and Mike are assholes actually. They are victims and understandly upset, and I think everyone is in agreement there.  He's asking if he's the asshole for going on a vacation with his family that his older children can't attend, and I genuinely don't think he is.  This is a sucky situation- his older kids are rightfully upset, but the solution isn't to make everyone upset.  I don't think this is an insurmountable upset either. There are things op can do, aside from punishing his new family that can show his older kids that he loves them and cares for them, this is just one trip.  He can take the older kids on a special vacation, just the three of them at a different point, or they can have an additional blended family bonding moment in a more accesible location.  The older kids  are allowed to be upset at this injustice, but they can also get over it. I think it's a bit of a leap to say this will ruin his relationship with his older kids forever.  It's not like he's planning on going on this trip and then never talking to his older kids again.\n\nOPs new family consists of not just his kids, but another grown adult as well.  If I was his new wife, I'd be pissed if op canceled! She has consented to let her kids go. What do her and ops children have to do with racist ex-wife?", "Especially if his custody is only a few days at a time or weekends and the mom won't give more days even", "If he wants to have a shitty relationship with the black people in his family he should cave to his racist ex.", "Agreed, they\u2019re 16 & 14 & OP says they get along with their half-siblings so they deserve to know the truth if they don\u2019t suss it out themselves. They\u2019re not little kids and hopefully aren\u2019t adopting her racism but OP needs to at least sit them down and explain everything. Or maybe even have the lawyers explain to them. And OP also can say they\u2019re still invited to things with his family, they just legally can\u2019t do certain things right now without permission from both of their parents. I know OP doesn\u2019t want to turn them against her but laying out the facts that she is legally preventing them from going is showing her whole ass anyway. \n\nI do like the idea of OP setting aside some money he would spend on them into a fund for a future trip when they\u2019re adults. Possibly like a graduation trip or something when they\u2019re adults but also with the option of just going with OP as a parental bonding thing or OP\u2019s family (and with the younger one, maybe all three). Or going to their future education. Something to let them remember they\u2019re not left out but there\u2019s other factors out of OP\u2019s control that prevents him from fully including them"]}
