It's not unreasonable to expect your partner to attend a wedding with you and his \"is that this year?\" routine proves that he knew about it. He knows your friend is important to you, he knows that this wedding is important to you, and he's totally disregarding that.\n\nI'm not blaming his friends and I'm not blaming you. It's completely your bf's fault. He was planning to go away with friends and he got so caught up in doing what *he* wanted that he double booked himself. Of course his friends don't want to change their plans. As far as they are concerned they all agreed to a time they were free, booked and paid for everything, and then suddenly your bf has a wedding to go to. If I was one of the friends, we'd all agreed to go away together, and then one of them wants to move the date for a wedding, I'm asking why the wedding wasn't mentioned earlier. What has your bf been telling his friends about *his* mistake?

In my humble opinion this is a red flag early on letting you know that he isn\u2019t putting the relationship ahead of his friendships.

It also seems like they moved away in part to support his career goals. A wedding like this would be a good opportunity for him to make connections with bond with people that are important to her. If she were important to him, I think he would want to do that. The fact that he\u2019s not apologetic about double scheduling makes him the asshole.

You'd have to have that conversation so many times). In his favor though, it sounds like he at least tried to ask his friends to reschedule initially?\n* You are less in the wrong here imo, but the way you are escalating it isn't great.

You say \u2018sorry gf, I messed up, I\u2019ll apologise to the boys and see them another time\u2019!\n\nA date mix up can happen to anyone, how you react afterwards is where you judge a person, and in this case, he showed where his priorities are.

OP first did she \"expected him to have a general idea\" of when the wedding would be happening, then edited the post to say there are reminders of the exact date on the fridge, etc. FWIW I don't look at the stuff hanging on the fridge either lol. I think the real issue is that they're fish out of water in the new town and it's particularly wearisome for bf... so much so that he needed this boys trip. He did act unilaterally, but how often does this happen in their relationship? Could be that he saw nothing wrong with it? True he should have talked to her about it first, and yeah he doubled booked himself without thinking,  but maybe the way it came about just didn't present the opportunity for much more than that.   Now ultimatums, insults, and drama's flying all over the place. I agree, nothing more boring than a wedding for people you barely know (which probably tells you where it sat on his list of prioritized \"things i really want to do\"). Everyone's saying he's choosing friends and a trip over her, but she's choosing her friend over his mental health sooo...\n\n So what is OP facing? 1) Going to the wedding alone because he's doing something he really could use right now. 2) Going to the wedding alone because she broke up with him. 3) Going to a wedding with a partner who really doesn't want to be there, so you're there together but feeling alone and having to \"manage\". 4) Telling her next bf she moved to a new town with her previous bf of 18 months ago was having a rough go of it and broke it off because he did something for his mental and emotional wellbeing rather than attend her friend's wedding with her.\n\n Honestly, I think bf should go on his trip, she should go to the wedding (alone or find another +1) and they both reconvene feeling refreshed, happy for one another, and ready to face the new fish bowl together again. It's this really the hill to die on?", "Mhm married person here who attended a few weddings over the last years.... Yes, it's cool if a partner joins to accompany you. But it's not needed. I would never force my husband to go to a wedding where he doesn't know people. His mental health can't handle this. And I prefer having a nice time at the wedding instead of sitting with him in the corner coping with panic attacks and anxiety. \nI prefer him not being miserable and me having a nice time over everyone suffering. \n\nSometimes it's the mature thing to just do your own thing, let a partner do theirs and not going wild with ultimatums and such nonsense.", "Thankfully it's only 1.5 years", "Yeah. My biggest beef with the bf is that he didn't at least OFFER to back out of the trip to keep his promise to her. Yeah, it stinks, but he DID make the first mistake here. And he doesn't seem to feel like the promise to OP to go with her to the wedding is a promise worth keeping. I have real issues with people who don't understand the *commit* in 'commitment.' It's a promise. And if you don't keep your commitments, you're just not trustworthy.\n\nSo it seems like this particular fight is 'trivial'...but to me that's only on the surface. The issue for me goes to the deeper problem of: he doesn't think a promise to her needs to be kept.\n\nHer insistence on his presence at the wedding of her friend is another issue. But to me, it's less than the main issue. She needs to be more flexible. But I'd have a very hard time trusting someone who breaks such a simple promise to me. It's not like he HAS to go on the trip. He WANTS to go. And she should have let him....but he should have offered to keep his promise first.", "what is his purpose  of being there in the first place? You will be busy with the bride. he doesn't know anyone there.", "Had to tell a friend 4 hours before her wedding that my husband wouldn't join the celebration because he had health issues. It wasn't awkward or anything. \nI don't get why everyone thinks it's so unforgivable to not attend a wedding together.", "She doesn\u2019t have to tell her friends where her boyfriend is she just has to say something came up", "How is that relevant to the situation? How busy she is / who he'd know at the wedding doesn't change the fact that he made those plans first. It doesn't contextualize him double booking in a way that excuses him backing out.\n\nThe move if he wanted to be considerate to his gf and his friends is to cop to double booking, back out of the boys trip without obligating them to reschedule and without throwing his gf under the bus, and then dealing. Because it was his mistake.\n\nIf he wants to do the selfish thing, he doesn't really get to invalidate his gf being reasonably upset in a bid to avoid the fallout from being an AH in the situation.", "If that was a problem for him, he should\u2019ve said something before they RSVPd. He said he was coming, so now it makes things awkward for her at the wedding. He made a commitment to her to go with her before he made plans with his friends. He should have paid his share of the vacation and let his friends go without him. Flaking on your partner after agreeing to attend their best friend\u2019s wedding with them is immature. His friends sound immature for encouraging him not to apologize or fix his mistake. If he\u2019s ok with breaking a promise to her because his priority is smoking pot with his friends, he\u2019s not a good partner. He either did this on purpose to get out of the wedding or he\u2019s just flaky and unreliable. I get why she gave him an ultimatum, and I think they\u2019re probably going to break up. When they do, he\u2019ll tell everyone it was because he didn\u2019t go to the wedding, but that won\u2019t be why. Not really.", "Not attending because of a health issue isn\u2019t the same thing at all. If it wouldn\u2019t bother you for your thats cool, but I get where OP is coming from. I think her boyfriend is being an asshole. If he didn\u2019t want to come to the wedding, he should\u2019ve said something before they RSVPd. Not being able to attend an event is different from deciding you just don\u2019t want to.", "But it's just as valid if he prefers to spend that day with his friends and doesn't want to go to a wedding where he wouldn't see OP that much anyway because she's busy with helping with everything.", "And she has the right to walk away if he can\u2019t be by her side at events that matter to her."]}
