It's not unreasonable to expect your partner to attend a wedding with you and his \"is that this year?\" routine proves that he knew about it. He knows your friend is important to you, he knows that this wedding is important to you, and he's totally disregarding that.\n\nI'm not blaming his friends and I'm not blaming you. It's completely your bf's fault. He was planning to go away with friends and he got so caught up in doing what *he* wanted that he double booked himself. Of course his friends don't want to change their plans. As far as they are concerned they all agreed to a time they were free, booked and paid for everything, and then suddenly your bf has a wedding to go to. If I was one of the friends, we'd all agreed to go away together, and then one of them wants to move the date for a wedding, I'm asking why the wedding wasn't mentioned earlier. What has your bf been telling his friends about *his* mistake? Because I'm guessing that it's your fault he can't manage his own social calendar. \n\nWhat it boils down to is that it's not *fair* to cancel the boys trip, but it's also not *fair* that you've already RSVP'd and he won't go to the wedding. Your boyfriend has put himself in a no win position through his own negligence. He has *chosen* his friends and himself over you.

That he so readily tossed aside a promise he'd made you doesn't speak well for him. If he can't keep so simple a promise, how can you trust him to keep ANY promise? Like wedding vows? Or a promise of fidelity?\n\nSo...NTA. \n\nBut perhaps for your *next* bf, if there's a mix-up like this and he DOES recommit to the promise he made you...consider being gracious & letting him off the hook.", "\nYou said it is not your fault that the friend won't reschedule but I am not sure that is true.

Sometimes you need to let something go to end an argument. If you disagree with how I\u2019m perceiving it, that\u2019s alright. You\u2019re entitled to your opinion. \n\nI guess you\u2019re correct by saying that he\u2019s getting what he wants, but he can\u2019t be in both places at once. I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s a true way to satisfy everyone. The only \u201csolutions\u201d  I see here are the following:\n\n- That he disappoints his friends by cancelling, goes to the event, and resents her for it.\n\n- She allows him to go to the trip and she attends her friend\u2019s wedding.\n\n- They split up over minutia. \n\nIt seems like he didn\u2019t know of the date, which means that it wasn\u2019t intentional. The compromise is that they both attend their events without splitting up.", "The wedding may be a big deal to you but it may not be a big deal to him.  Does he even know your best friend? Are they friends?\n\nYes he should have checked with you but demanding everyone else reschedule is ridiculous,\n\nThis isn\u2019t a relationship ending scenario in my book.\n\nand you will likely be very busy", "Something being on the fridge means absolutely nothing. This is a failure on your part and you're being unreasonable.  Better luck with your next relationship.", "Why should she need to remind him all the time? He knew he had an event, and didn\u2019t check his schedule or ask his partner if they had something planned. Should she be checking in every week to remind him? He\u2019s a grown man who is sharing his life with someone. It\u2019s his responsibility to check dates with his own schedule and with his partner.", "Compromising means meeting halfway, but you're saying him getting what he wants is a compromise.\n\nHow would you respond if I suggested they compromise by him going to the wedding?", "Wedding was planned before they were even together too. It's basically just a background item that existed before the relationship.", "The way she worded it, it sounded like she just expected him to know just because it was posted on the fridge before they were together.", "Change the date is the guys trip.  He goes to the wedding and gets his trip. That's compromise.", "I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so important for him to be at the wedding. A compromise can be him doing his own thing and her doing hers. She is a bridesmaid and is going to be very busy. He is probably not going to know many people there. I don\u2019t see why he absolutely has to go", "In all honesty, if they came together as a couple and decided to \u201ccompromise\u201d by him going to the wedding, then that\u2019s their right and it\u2019s fine. The difference with the argument you\u2019re trying to make is the fact that he has to miss out on his event, whereas if she allows him to go to his event, then they both attend their friend\u2019s events. \n\nThe wedding is her event for her friend and while she\u2019d like for him to be present, I really don\u2019t see why it\u2019s required. Why should he miss out on his time with friends to appease her while she goes to an event for her friend? On the other hand, I also feel like his friends could be a bit more understanding. The only thing I can think of is that the money he put down for this event in non refundable, which is why he can\u2019t change the date.\n\nUnless he knew of the date beforehand and agreed to it, I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s such a big deal for him to go. It\u2019s just my opinion.", "I agree, but bf refuses to do that.", "They had plans to go together. But I'm this thread, my biggest question is how is it a compromise for him to get exactly what he wants and for her to not get anything she wants?", "Well they RSVPd together and have a Save The Date on the fridge. He has stayed at the brides apartment before. The wedding was planned and agreed to before the guys trip.", "It may not be possible for his friend to reschedule and she admits her boyfriend really really missed his friends. Her post also indicates she know doesn\u2019t want him to go at all since his friends dared to criticize her.\n\nI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so important for him to attend the wedding other than it is for her to show off that she has a boyfriend.  And she is going to be super busy and does he even know her best friend?  Will he even know any one there?   \n\nHe may be stuck for a whole weekend with people her barely knows when he could have been with his friends.\n\nYes he should have checked the dates but I think she is being very selfish and taking the friends criticism to them versus me ultimatum honestly she is the one not ready for a relationship.\n\nRelationships are about compromise and the compromise is both get to be with their friends and also she could ask him to make it up to her.\n\nLet\u2019s say he goes to the wedding his friends are angry and he is bored stiffed.  Think that won\u2019t lead to resentment on his end.\n\nIn in a relationship I would never break up with my boyfriend over something like that", "Prior to her edit from a few minutes ago, this information was not known and this does change the story. \n\nThe fact that this wedding date was known beforehand and agreed upon with an RSVP makes her NTA in that regard. It also shows where his priorities are as far as their relationship is concerned to a certain degree. He\u2019s choosing his friends. I initially thought he never knew the date and didn\u2019t RSVP. He probably forgot the date.", "Staying at the brides apartment once doesn\u2019t equal friends with bride I doubt boyfriend will know almost anyone there", "He shouldn't have scheduled a trip when he already has one scheduled. She probably doesn't want to be alone at the wedding. It's like a nice date. Of course we don't have the details, but often couples will be seated together, and dance, etc. At the ceremony hell be in the audience without her, but other than that they would be together. And how busy do you think bridesmaids are?? Sand he did know the bride and had stayed at her place.\n\nIf it was going to be so horrible, he shouldn't have agreed to go just to flake because something he'd rather do came up. \n\nShe wants them to be together for this event. Your suggestion is not a compromise. It's him getting exactly what he wants and her not getting what she wants. He is bailing on his commitment.\n\nPs - would your boyfriend commit to a trip with you, then intentionally schedule a different trip and not tell you until everything had been paid for?", "There's also the Save The Date on the fridge. He just really, really doesn't care.", "I agree with that. It\u2019s her friend, but I think the important factor here is the fact that he knew of the date and agreed to be his girlfriend\u2019s plus one. Then he booked his friend\u2019s getaway and didn\u2019t tell her about it. He probably forgot what day it was, made plans with his friends, and then got into this tizzy.", "She said \u201che knew he was suppose to go.\u201d This sounds very much like a she told him \n\nStaying at place is just maybe they visited for a weekend \n\nthey live out of town. She didn\u2019t say they were friends.\n\nBridesmaids are very busy there is rehearsal/ rehearsal dinner. There is getting ready with the bride (hours) than there are pictures (hours). \n\nAs not a member of the bridal party he will be on his own.\n\nAt the reception often the wedding party sits by themselves.  \n\nSo she is going to be very busy and he is going to be spending an awful lot of the day and also potentially the weekend by himself without her.\n\nYes he was wrong and should have checked with her. But it may have been a mistake and his friends could have been nicer?\n\nBut honestly relationships are also being flexible and thinking about the other person.\n\nI don\u2019t see why it\u2019s so absolutely relationship ultimatum necessary for him to be there and I think she could be understanding of his need to have that time with his friends.", "As I said before, the edit is a game changer. For this circumstance alone, I think her reaction is extreme. However, it could be just the tip of the iceberg for other relationship issues. He doesn\u2019t seem to care and something that matters to his girlfriend should matter to him. He agreed to go and now he\u2019s reneging on his promise. If he forgot, he should just be honest about it and work to resolve this issue. It\u2019s all about communication!", "I agree that he should have checked the dates and this shouldn\u2019t be a habit. But as long as it\u2019s a one off I think she should let him go on his trip.\n\nTo me the fact that she took it this far would be huge red flags \ud83d\udea9 if I were him and I think before telling him he is not ready for a serious relationship she needs to take a good look in the mirror", "She was understanding. She was perfectly okay with him going--at literally any other time. He committed to going. If he didn't want to go, he should have said so in the beginning instead of intentionally planning a trip for the same time and not telling her until after the reservations had been made.", "I don't think someone who flakes so easily on their partner is ready for a committed relationship.", "^^^ This 100% I feel exactly the same. I understand that she\u2019s frustrated, but I think the reaction is over the top and ridiculous."]}
