For several weeks she has been talking about a special event she wants to attend ( won't mention what to maintain anonymity) so I bought her tickets. \n\nMy MIL wrote me asking for ideas for my wife's birthday. I told her my wife's favorite restaurants and what she expressed to me she wants to do for the family gathering. \n\nMIL insisted that she wanted to do some sort of activity with my wife. Not go out to eat. So I told MIL about special event and that I already bought tickets.  \n\nFor the next several days MIL was acting very sketchy. She insisted  that she and her daughter meet up for a girls day. \n\nI read the writing on the wall and assumed my MIL wanted to steal my gift giving thunder , so I surprised my wife with the tickets the day before she was to meet up with her mom. \n\nSure enough, MIl did buy another set of tickets to the event. Told my wife she over heard her talking about it and that she wanted to surprise her before her birthday. \n\nMy wife told her that was very kind but that she already had tickets from me. Maybe she( mil)  could find some one who wanted to join and we could all go together. That would be fun.\n\nMil took it in stride that day ( so I hear, I wasn't there) but the next day she called me and told me I was horrible for giving her her gift early.\n\nI asked her why she bought tickets to the same event and why she tried to give her gift early if I'm horrible for doing the same thing. She told me it's her right as mother and that I was horrible.  Then she hung up on me. \n\nSo, aita?", "created_utc": 1685991141, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/141o8v2/aita_for_giving_my_wife_her_birthday_gift_early/", "score": 329, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How unoriginal of her and a very lame mom who can't even come up with a good gift idea for her daughter.\n\nAnd from now on I would lie about that stuff to MIL or tell her that your wife wants nothing.", "She is the AH not you. NTA, she is such a jerk and you need to keep quiet about special gifts in the future.", "NTA- played her at her own game and you won.", "NTA, that is hilarious", "You are not TA...MIL is for getting the same tickets..", "NTA - but why did you even mention it in the first place rather than give her other ideas she could use?", "So, one big question I have is, did MIL take your other present ideas and attempt to pass them off on her own early? The reason I ask is because you seemed quite certain rather quickly that her \"sketchy behavior\" and her wanting to do a \"girls day\" early meant she was going to pass your gift idea off as her own. Plus, 40 is a difficult birthday for a lot of people, and the decade birthdays hold a more sentimental marker too. So, not only is it extremely rude to steal your gift idea and pass off as her own, by attempting to gift it to her early, she would have left you high and dry without any gift for your wife on her very special day. Granted, you could have still given her your gift, but it would make you look like you stole your MIL gift and didn't take time to find a thoughtful gift of your own. Honestly, people have gotten divorced for less, and it makes you look like you don't truly love your wife. \nYou are definitely NTA here, and I honestly hope you let your wife know what actually happened. It also makes me wonder if MIL is just a bad git giver, she's just a narcissist who \"needs\" to give best gift, or if she wanted to create a problem with your marriage. While she most likely will never ask you for gift ideas in the future, on the off chance she does, I hope you give her horrible advice. \nOh, and the fact that you gave wife your gift the night  before her outing, that was a straight-up perfect play on MIL.", "NTA. I, too, had to learn to beat my MIL at her own games.

MIL fucked around and found out.", "I didn't think about it at the time. I was just being conversational. It's just the way she was acting and insisting about a meet up before her birthday. \n\nBut yeah, that's kinda what I was feeling to. That's why I'm asking.", "Pretty sure OP already knew, which is why they preempted the gift.", "Victory Dance!", "No, I see why you thought that though.

Don't let this woman, who was glad to steal your idea because she couldn't come up with any ideas that she liked ( going to a restaurant was a good idea, also she could have thought of a spa) or would make her look good to your wife, make you feel like an AH. Ignore her and of needed be cordial and act like it doesn't bother you. She wants you to feel guilty for her lazyness, don't let her.", "What does your wife think about what her mom did?
