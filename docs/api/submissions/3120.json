{"id": 3120, "submission_id": "z3fvy2", "title": "AITA for asking my sister to give up her kids for adoption?", "selftext": "My sister (29 F) got married 4 years ago in an arranged marriage setup. Just a bit on the family dynamics. I have always been the studious kid, like i have a Master's in Mathematics and am doing my second Master's now, while my sis barely scrapped through her Bachelor's and didnt want to study further. We come from a well off family and she has never worked a day in her life.\n\nSo when she turned 25, my parents basically told her to get married since she is doing practically nothing with her life. As i figure, there were a lot of arguements but eventually she succumed. She married a fairly successful lawyer our parents introduced her to, less than a year after meeting him. They had 3 wonderful kids after that, all within the 4 years of marriage. The guy is an absentee father who thinks helping out at home or with the kids is not his role. \n\nMy sister is clearly resentful. She has grown up since and wants to do something with her life like taking up a job or going back to school but it's quite hard to do, with having 3 little kids, an unsupportive husband and a degree thats basically useless. She is taking out her resentment on the kids, defn not being abusive but not being particularly loving either. She will do the bare minimum for them, blames the husband (rightfully) and the babies for her situation. Anytime i call or visit her, she is bitching about those poor kids who are just being babies. \n\nI have had enough with her and told her to give the kids up for adoption if she is so tired of them. She told me that I am an ungrateful brat who was never pressured like she was, that i live in a lala land where u can just give up on kids, and then hung up on me. She hasn't been talking to me for over a month now. AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to add since a couple of comments are mentioning it, do you guys think I just randomly got up and told her to give up on the kids. Well you do obviously, since i didn't mention it but they are my nieces/nephew and I adore those babies. Talk to your husband, hire a nanny etc etc, everything has been suggested by me as well as her friends. \n\nThe husband doesn't want to pay for the nanny since he thinks that she doesn't work so she could atleast take care of the kids and if she wants to study, it's on her to manage the time. He says he will take up half the care if she earns half the money in the household.  She can't divorce him since she says that she doesn't have what it takes to be a minimum wage worker with 3 kids and do a uni degree on top of it. She never wanted kids, they just happened and she couldn't abort. And it's not like that I don't want to support but i can barely take care of myself with the degree, internship and chores, I don't have the time or energy to help her out even though i want to.", "created_utc": 1669283310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3fvy2/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_give_up_her_kids_for/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't work like that. You can't just give up your kids. Even if she were to surrender them, she could be liable for child support. Even if she found a situation where she could sign off her parental rights without being on the hook financially, her husband would have to do the same.\n\nThe real world doesn't work like that lol. YTA.", "YTA. First your sister was basically forced to marry man she obviously doesn't love just to appease your condescending parents. My guess is this is a culture or a country where the male party rules. She has three young children that she has to take care pretty much all by herself with no help from her spouse, who I'm pretty sure based on the little bit you said is very lackluster about her feelings and his own children, and not only is she berated for complaining she's told to give up her children. Obviously she loves them if she got so angry with you. Your sister is severely depressed and she's going to become a statistic if you don't grow up and find a way to help her. She obviously is asking and struggling for help and this is the only way she can do it. Shame on all of you. This is why so many people unalive themselves.", "YTA\n\nYou don't know what it's like to be in her situation and yet you're making an awful lot of assumptions about your sister here. The correct response is to be supportive and make suggestions like getting her husband to help more, or perhaps looking into a nanny or a sitter so your sister has time to go back to school and figure out what she wants to do with her life. \n\nInstead you humblebrag about your education and overlook the fact that your sister was practically forced into getting married as she didn't know what to do with her life at just twenty-five years old.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister for taking out her frustrations on her kids, her husband for not contributing at all and you for not offering truly helpful advice or real help.", "YTA\n\nKids aren\u2019t disposable and any decent person doesn\u2019t just discard them when life gets hard\n\nJust because YOU wanted multiple uni degrees doesn\u2019t give you the right to now look down on her because she didn\u2019t \n\nA good sibling would support her and encourage her, Not berate her when she\u2019s already down and clearly depressed\n\nMaybe her husband should actually step up and be a parent being that they are his kids too and his old fashioned views are going the way of the dinosaur \n\nDon\u2019t be her enemy, Because at this point you\u2019re no better than the husband", "YTA\n\nSometimes what seems like resentment in parents is just bone-deep exhaustion. What can help them a bit is to be able to vent. Ideally they have a partner by their side with whom they can exchange their minor frustrations so that this level of resentment or exhaustion doesn't build up. But your sister doesn't seem to have that kind of a relationship, so she went to the next best person: her sister, who proceeded to verbally beat her down because she'd already been looking down on her. \n\nYour sister needs help. Three kids and no break from them can get to the most saintly of parents. Be a better sister.\n\nEdited to read \"sister\" instead of \"brother\".", "YTA she doesn't need to give her kids for adoption, she need to talk with her husband and therapy.", "ESH.", "ESH, your comment wasn't useful since I doubt she can adopt them out easily, especially without the father's consent.", "YTA. Your comment about adoption (even after your edits) sounds rather flippant. Your sister sounds like a stressed out mom with young kids, which is completely understandable. She needs a support network of friends and family. She expected you to try and be that, but rather it sounds like you lashed out after your suggestions were rejected.", "ESH But you live in Golden child la la land. You're smart enough to know your sister was put in an impossible by your parents and now her husband. Conditional love is antithetical to happiness and that seems to be all she has. Of course she feels stuck in survival mode, she needs therapy, and non transactional relationships. If you don't have helpful advice or don't want to lend an ear, don't. But Don't mock her despair.", "ESH except kids.", "YTA. They\u2019re her kids and her husband\u2019s kids. Unless you actually think there\u2019s abuse going on, stay out of it.", "Yta. You don't just throw away your kids because you want to go to college, or because you aren't happy", "ESH. You sister and her husband should never have had kids if they didn\u2019t want them. YTA because you aren\u2019t offering real help. Children are not disposable and their worth is t based on someone else wanting them.", "Your sister is TA. She is mistreating her kids rather than taking care of them a parent should. Being unwanted or seen as a burden by a parent will do great emotional harm to them. You have given good suggestions but she would rather emotionally abuse her kids. Frankly she is too selfish and lazy to treat them properly or give them up for adoption. It's a shame those kids will never have a chance to be raised by parents that want them.", "YTA\n\nInstead of judging your sister, for the love of all that's Holy, **take her to Planned Parenthood to get a contraceptive implant**.\n\n**Your sister has been baby trapped**.\n\n**She needs your help not your judgmen**t.", "Yta on a whole different level.", "YTA. Your sister is clearly struggling, and this is how you treat her? Shame on you.", "ESH. Your sister should have better stood up for herself. She should have made it clear she didn't want kids. She should have never married him to begin with. Your parents shouldn't have pressured her so hard. They pushed her into a bad situation. I think your parents are the biggest assholes out of this. You suck for saying to give them up for adoption but if you've suggested everything else, it's just another suggestion. It's unrealistic though because it would put those kids through a hell they don't deserve.", "YTA and your edits do nothing to improve your case.\n\nSo *you're* too overwhelmed with all that's going on in your own life to help at all, and that's completely fine, but your sister who has 3 kids under 4 and an unsupportive husband, none of which she chose, has no excuse and is not allowed to be overwhelmed?  She needs someone to flippantly, derisively suggest she just give up her children already because you're tired of listening to her complain while, again *overwhelmed by having 3 children under 4 and absolutely no support?*  Not from her husband, not from her parents, and clearly not from her sister.\n\nIf you're tired of hearing it, imagine, just *imagine* for a moment how very tired she is living it.\n\nBut it's okay.  You're barely holding yourself together.  You simply don't have the energy to do more than judge her.\n\nAnd you know what?  Issues of consent and choice and agency overall are *extremely* muddied here given the circumstances of the marriage and births.  It's not like that ever affected anyone's stress level or mental health or bonding either, or anything.\n\nBut hey, you were spared all that because you were \"doing something with your life\" and are more valuable, right?", "Obviously YTA. You can't just dispose of children like that. What a heartless, flippant remark.\nYour sister sounds exhausted; 3 under 4 is ROUGH. She's allowed to complain. If you do nothing else for her (which it sounds like you don't) then listen to her vent without judging.", "I will go with NTA here. Rational thinking, a person should not have kids when they did not want kids. Your sister gave birth to them and then complained about it, that's on her, she made the decision, she has to live with it. It seems like your sister is using you as a trash bag to put all her negativities in it, and drag you down. I suggest you tell her to get therapy, you don't get paid enough to be her therapist. If she does not talk to you, then, consider it was a good thing, no more negativities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know how difficult or easy it is in the country that you live in but I have seen to many examples in my life of how devastating the impact of non-loving parents can be on a child. So if it is truly how OP says and sister doesn't love the children doing only the bare minimum while her husband doesn't seem to care at all, then this place is not where a child should grow up. They should be in an environment that is truly supportive of their growth even if in reality it is very difficult to accomplish that change.Depending on where your sister lives consider contacting the relevant governmental offices if they provide good services. A dear friend of mine works in child-care and has to deal with really sad or straight up horrifying things but he still tries to deal with the family as a whole in mind obviously putting the children's well-being on first position. Maybe if you find someone like that from an official place, you can make an impact to get the best out of the situation for the children, so they are provided with a good environment to grow.", "It's hard seeing children neglected (by the way neglect is abuse) and I think your heart is in the right place.

You could be supportive and babysit once in awhile, tell your parents they made this mess and they should help, or find her a good divorce attorney because with 3 babies and being SAH she probably would get alimony and child support. \n\nSis should also seek counseling to help with being a parent and being forced into a loveless marriage", "YTA so your sister was basically forced into a loveless marriage with a man who thinks women folk pop babies out and take care of them and the house while he works n nothing else. Yes her bitching to you would get tedius but I very much doubt her telling him how she feels will make any difference she's his property nothing else and she feels trapped which in a way she is how do your parents feel about divorce? I'm guessing rhey wouldn't be happy with that", "Going against the grain but NTA. It's exhausting listening to someone complain about a situation of their own making while rejecting every solution everyone provides to change their situation. It's not just you, her friends are offering solutions and she's turning them down too. Especially when she's being emotionally abusive to kids who didn't ask to be here. Kids that she brought into the world. Kids who are babies are toddlers.\n\nSo I get reaching the end of your tether and being like, \"just adopt out your kids then if you hate them that much\". Obviously it's not an actual solution to her problem. Realistically your sister needs to get one of these minimum wage jobs she looks down on so much and apply to some evening courses.
