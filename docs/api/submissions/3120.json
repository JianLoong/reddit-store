{"id": 3120, "submission_id": "z3fvy2", "title": "AITA for asking my sister to give up her kids for adoption?", "selftext": "My sister (29 F) got married 4 years ago in an arranged marriage setup. Just a bit on the family dynamics. I have always been the studious kid, like i have a Master's in Mathematics and am doing my second Master's now, while my sis barely scrapped through her Bachelor's and didnt want to study further. We come from a well off family and she has never worked a day in her life.\n\nSo when she turned 25, my parents basically told her to get married since she is doing practically nothing with her life. As i figure, there were a lot of arguements but eventually she succumed. She married a fairly successful lawyer our parents introduced her to, less than a year after meeting him. They had 3 wonderful kids after that, all within the 4 years of marriage. The guy is an absentee father who thinks helping out at home or with the kids is not his role. \n\nMy sister is clearly resentful. She has grown up since and wants to do something with her life like taking up a job or going back to school but it's quite hard to do, with having 3 little kids, an unsupportive husband and a degree thats basically useless. She is taking out her resentment on the kids, defn not being abusive but not being particularly loving either. She will do the bare minimum for them, blames the husband (rightfully) and the babies for her situation. Anytime i call or visit her, she is bitching about those poor kids who are just being babies. \n\nI have had enough with her and told her to give the kids up for adoption if she is so tired of them. She told me that I am an ungrateful brat who was never pressured like she was, that i live in a lala land where u can just give up on kids, and then hung up on me. She hasn't been talking to me for over a month now. AITA?\n\nEdit: Just to add since a couple of comments are mentioning it, do you guys think I just randomly got up and told her to give up on the kids. Well you do obviously, since i didn't mention it but they are my nieces/nephew and I adore those babies. Talk to your husband, hire a nanny etc etc, everything has been suggested by me as well as her friends. \n\nThe husband doesn't want to pay for the nanny since he thinks that she doesn't work so she could atleast take care of the kids and if she wants to study, it's on her to manage the time. He says he will take up half the care if she earns half the money in the household.  She can't divorce him since she says that she doesn't have what it takes to be a minimum wage worker with 3 kids and do a uni degree on top of it. She never wanted kids, they just happened and she couldn't abort. And it's not like that I don't want to support but i can barely take care of myself with the degree, internship and chores, I don't have the time or energy to help her out even though i want to.\n\nEdit: Thanks for your inputs everyone :) \nI am 22 and i haven't reached that age yet where my parents wanted her to be married. I can't know all about what she went through and make any judgement about her. This wasn't my intention either tbh. I understand how totally different our situations are or will be, and a lot of it is based on our different temperaments while growing up. I was quite insensitive with that remark. I will apologise and offer to help where and when I can.", "created_utc": 1669283310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3fvy2/aita_for_asking_my_sister_to_give_up_her_kids_for/", "score": 289, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't work like that. You can't just give up your kids. Even if she were to surrender them, she could be liable for child support. Even if she found a situation where she could sign off her parental rights without being on the hook financially, her husband would have to do the same.\n\nThe real world doesn't work like that lol. YTA.", "YTA. First your sister was basically forced to marry man she obviously doesn't love just to appease your condescending parents. My guess is this is a culture or a country where the male party rules. She has three young children that she has to take care pretty much all by herself with no help from her spouse, who I'm pretty sure based on the little bit you said is very lackluster about her feelings and his own children, and not only is she berated for complaining she's told to give up her children. Obviously she loves them if she got so angry with you. Your sister is severely depressed and she's going to become a statistic if you don't grow up and find a way to help her. She obviously is asking and struggling for help and this is the only way she can do it. Shame on all of you. This is why so many people unalive themselves.", "YTA\n\nYou don't know what it's like to be in her situation and yet you're making an awful lot of assumptions about your sister here. The correct response is to be supportive and make suggestions like getting her husband to help more, or perhaps looking into a nanny or a sitter so your sister has time to go back to school and figure out what she wants to do with her life. \n\nInstead you humblebrag about your education and overlook the fact that your sister was practically forced into getting married as she didn't know what to do with her life at just twenty-five years old.", "ESH.\n\nYour sister for taking out her frustrations on her kids, her husband for not contributing at all and you for not offering truly helpful advice or real help.", "YTA\n\nKids aren\u2019t disposable and any decent person doesn\u2019t just discard them when life gets hard\n\nJust because YOU wanted multiple uni degrees doesn\u2019t give you the right to now look down on her because she didn\u2019t \n\nA good sibling would support her and encourage her, Not berate her when she\u2019s already down and clearly depressed\n\nMaybe her husband should actually step up and be a parent being that they are his kids too and his old fashioned views are going the way of the dinosaur \n\nDon\u2019t be her enemy, Because at this point you\u2019re no better than the husband", "YTA\n\nSometimes what seems like resentment in parents is just bone-deep exhaustion. What can help them a bit is to be able to vent. Ideally they have a partner by their side with whom they can exchange their minor frustrations so that this level of resentment or exhaustion doesn't build up. But your sister doesn't seem to have that kind of a relationship, so she went to the next best person: her sister, who proceeded to verbally beat her down because she'd already been looking down on her. \n\nYour sister needs help. Three kids and no break from them can get to the most saintly of parents.

Your comment about adoption (even after your edits) sounds rather flippant. Your sister sounds like a stressed out mom with young kids, which is completely understandable. She needs a support network of friends and family. She expected you to try and be that, but rather it sounds like you lashed out after your suggestions were rejected.", "ESH But you live in Golden child la la land. You're smart enough to know your sister was put in an impossible by your parents and now her husband. Conditional love is antithetical to happiness and that seems to be all she has. Of course she feels stuck in survival mode, she needs therapy, and non transactional relationships. If you don't have helpful advice or don't want to lend an ear, don't.

YTA because you aren\u2019t offering real help. Children are not disposable and their worth is t based on someone else wanting them.", "Your sister is TA. She is mistreating her kids rather than taking care of them a parent should. Being unwanted or seen as a burden by a parent will do great emotional harm to them. You have given good suggestions but she would rather emotionally abuse her kids. Frankly she is too selfish and lazy to treat them properly or give them up for adoption. It's a shame those kids will never have a chance to be raised by parents that want them.", "YTA\n\nInstead of judging your sister, for the love of all that's Holy, **take her to Planned Parenthood to get a contraceptive implant**.\n\n**Your sister has been baby trapped**.\n\n**She needs your help not your judgmen**t.", "Yta on a whole different level.", "YTA. Your sister is clearly struggling, and this is how you treat her? Shame on you.", "ESH. Your sister should have better stood up for herself. She should have made it clear she didn't want kids. She should have never married him to begin with. Your parents shouldn't have pressured her so hard. They pushed her into a bad situation. I think your parents are the biggest assholes out of this. You suck for saying to give them up for adoption but if you've suggested everything else, it's just another suggestion. It's unrealistic though because it would put those kids through a hell they don't deserve.", "YTA and your edits do nothing to improve your case.\n\nSo *you're* too overwhelmed with all that's going on in your own life to help at all, and that's completely fine, but your sister who has 3 kids under 4 and an unsupportive husband, none of which she chose, has no excuse and is not allowed to be overwhelmed?  She needs someone to flippantly, derisively suggest she just give up her children already because you're tired of listening to her complain while, again *overwhelmed by having 3 children under 4 and absolutely no support?*  Not from her husband, not from her parents, and clearly not from her sister.\n\nIf you're tired of hearing it, imagine, just *imagine* for a moment how very tired she is living it.\n\nBut it's okay.  You're barely holding yourself together.  You simply don't have the energy to do more than judge her.\n\nAnd you know what?  Issues of consent and choice and agency overall are *extremely* muddied here given the circumstances of the marriage and births.  It's not like that ever affected anyone's stress level or mental health or bonding either, or anything.\n\nBut hey, you were spared all that because you were \"doing something with your life\" and are more valuable, right?", "Obviously YTA. You can't just dispose of children like that. What a heartless, flippant remark.\nYour sister sounds exhausted; 3 under 4 is ROUGH. She's allowed to complain. If you do nothing else for her (which it sounds like you don't) then listen to her vent without judging.", "I will go with NTA here. Rational thinking, a person should not have kids when they did not want kids. Your sister gave birth to them and then complained about it, that's on her, she made the decision, she has to live with it. It seems like your sister is using you as a trash bag to put all her negativities in it, and drag you down. I suggest you tell her to get therapy, you don't get paid enough to be her therapist. If she does not talk to you, then, consider it was a good thing, no more negativities.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know how difficult or easy it is in the country that you live in but I have seen to many examples in my life of how devastating the impact of non-loving parents can be on a child. So if it is truly how OP says and sister doesn't love the children doing only the bare minimum while her husband doesn't seem to care at all, then this place is not where a child should grow up. They should be in an environment that is truly supportive of their growth even if in reality it is very difficult to accomplish that change.Depending on where your sister lives consider contacting the relevant governmental offices if they provide good services. A dear friend of mine works in child-care and has to deal with really sad or straight up horrifying things but he still tries to deal with the family as a whole in mind obviously putting the children's well-being on first position.

It's exhausting listening to someone complain about a situation of their own making while rejecting every solution everyone provides to change their situation. It's not just you, her friends are offering solutions and she's turning them down too. Especially when she's being emotionally abusive to kids who didn't ask to be here. Kids that she brought into the world. Kids who are babies are toddlers.\n\nSo I get reaching the end of your tether and being like, \"just adopt out your kids then if you hate them that much\". Obviously it's not an actual solution to her problem. Realistically your sister needs to get one of these minimum wage jobs she looks down on so much and apply to some evening courses.

And unless she can\u2019t take care of them at all for some reason she can give them away. \n\nAnd don\u2019t involve with her anymore. Let her deal with her own family matters.", "YTA. Your sister needs support and understanding, not judgement. She was pushed into this marriage and situation she did not want. But that does not mean she does not love her children. You don't walk away from your children away because you have difficulties with your spouse, you walk away from the spouse if the marriage cannot be repaired.\n\nIt sounds to me like your sister needs something in her life outside of her children. I would support her in anything she needs to do to feel more fulfilled. Encourage her to get on reliable birth control, if she has access to it. Ask her what it is that would give her purpose and meaning outside of her home. What are her interests and passions? It sounds like her husband makes enough money to support the family financially, so she does not need to take just any job in order to pay the bills.", "YTA.", "YTA - every single parent complains about their kid at some point and no we\u2019re not just going to give them up for adoption.  You obviously have a bit of growing up to do if you think that\u2019s how it works.  People with no kids tend to be the most judgmental and you fit right in there.", "Your sister is struggling and all your family and her husband better hear her before she ends up doing something awful to the kids.  In my opinion giving them up for adoption is better than an entire childhood of being resented for just existing.  NTA but be vigilant with your nieces and nephews and find a way to help your sister she sounds like she is in the throes of post partum depression.", "This doesn\u2019t sound like they are in USA. I\u2019m guessing India or somewhere in that region of the world where arranged marriages are far more common. Sister may have few rights compared to her husband, who is a lawyer so can afford to make it even harder for her, leaving him could mean shame in the community and she\u2019ll struggle to find employment suitable or housing for herself and three young children. Her parents insisted on this marriage, they won\u2019t support her leaving. Her wanting to educate herself or retrain will be met with \u2018you\u2019re married with children, tend to your family and forget a career, your husband can look after you.\u2019 And contraceptive implants may not be available or difficult to get, although with three young ones a doctor may be more helpful. \n\n\nBasically this isn\u2019t a situation where Sister can leave without breaking ties with family, losing her children or being shunned/ talked about locally. She\u2019s truly trapped unless her family or friends help her or she gets support from somewhere else.", "OP is in lala land they\u2019re 22 and think they can manage 3 kids just because they have a degree lol. Im a stay at home mom have a degree and a partner and sometimes still get exhausted by my kid being a parent is exhausting. Sounds like sis just needed to vent to so someone and confided in sibling but sibling thinks the world is unicorns and rainbows. I\u2019m glad my sister is also a parent so we can vent to each other without wanting to adopt each others kids lol. OP you should head over to r/beyondthebump plenty of parents complain and not necessarily want to give their kids up.", "I want to know how they managed to have a masters degree (and be working on a second) at age 22. Is OP Doogie Howser?\n\nNot to mention all the spelling mistakes for such an educated person. They even call themself bibliophagist. Someone who read that much would not make such basic errors.", "Okay yes that remark was awful which i didn't realise,  but i am certainly not like her husband.", "You forgot the parents. They are the worst ads holds here. They caused this.", "I am 22..so tbh i haven't reached that age yet where my parents forced her into a wedding. I understand how totally different our situations are or will be, and a lot of it is based on our different temperaments while growing up. I was quite insensitive with that remark. I will apologise and offer to help where and when I can.", "Sadly, as a teacher, I see this happen. Parents leaving their kids for all sorts of reasons (new SOs, jobs in other states, drugs\u2026.the list goes on). The kids are then left to be raised by an unprepared single parent or grandparents, leaving me to pick up the pieces when they come to class angry at the world.", "OP is also delusional about what is involved with giving up parental rights.", "You could be supportive and babysit once in awhile, tell your parents they made this mess and they should help,", "She was forced into a marriage. She didn\u2019t do that herself. She says she didn\u2019t want kids. One could assume that she didn\u2019t have access to birth control or was even refused access to birth control. Also there is the question of whether she consented to the sex that resulted in her getting pregnant. And then she was not allowed access to an abortion. She is clearly currently a victim of coercive control, emotional abuse, and financial abuse. \n\nTo me it seems that she didn\u2019t do any of it to herself", "Could you add an edit describing in detail the process required to \u201cgive up\u201d her children?", "Your \u201cat least it\u2019s not me\u201d attitude says otherwise", "You're not?\n\nHow much help are you giving her?\n\nBecause it sounds to me that she was at least somewhat forced into marriage and motherhood, while you stand on the side gloating that you got to escape it and throwing nasty comments from the peanut gallery while offering nothing constructive to help her out.", "You are an awful person, you supposed to support your sister if not practically at least emotionally not just saying to leave her children. She need help but obviously you are too insensitive to help her", "Was she forced? From what I interpreted, she was pressured.", "Why should they help? They didn't have multiple kids with a husband that does jack all. Why is this sibling responsible for their sisters choices?", "This j couldn't imagine anything worse a loveless marriage where your not respected, kids you didn't want, no options in life because you can't leave the kids as no one seems willing to help I would have run away from my family had they suggested this", "The sister wanted the kids or she'd not have got pregnant THREE times. She can use contraception or abstain. There was no gun to her head.", "***Because they were not her choices*****, as the OP makes clear**. This was an arranged marriage and in those cultures, abortion is taboo if not literally illegal. \n\nThis woman was forced into domestic and reproductive slavery, and you're like \"she had kids, sucks to be her!\"?", "We had two toddlers at once and I took night shift half the nights and it was still incredibly exhausting (on top of the stress). And we had in-law support & a nanny. I can\u2019t imagine what OP\u2019s sister is going through.", "Absolutely.

Now to be fair, I don\u2019t agree with your sister blaming and resenting her kids\n\nBut you could\u2019ve been more supportive, her husband is refusing to help out with the chores and parenting. That\u2019s not okay, everyone needs to do their share of housework not burden it on one family member and gender should not be an excuse to not help out. Also your parents weren\u2019t any better either. It\u2019s your sister\u2019s choice whether she wants to be married and have kids or not, not theirs. You could\u2019ve maybe at the very least TRY to talk some sense into your brother-in-law and call out your parents but if they\u2019re refusing to cooperate and listen that\u2019s on them.\n\nYou should probably apologize and talk to her that you understand she\u2019s stress but that not an excuse to take it out on the kids and that you don\u2019t like the way she\u2019s treating her kids and that it wasn\u2019t fair of her to put blame on the kids since they didn\u2019t get a choice either and that just because people wronged her doesn\u2019t mean she can do the same to her kids in a civilized manner", "YTA - doesn't sound like there is a lot wrong with her setup, except that you don't approve. it was clear what type of a husband she was marrying at the time. Adults have to live with their choices.", "OP, what's stopping your parents from demanding you get married at 25?\n\nAs for your sister, it seems like she has PBD, but also resents her life choices.. I would just try to be there, help if able.", "Wow YTA. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want to hear complaints anymore. She\u2019s not looking for your advice, just support. Just say you can\u2019t support her or need a break.", "ESH, she shouldn\u2019t be taking her resentment out on her children, you telling her to place them for adoption is seriously out of line. In addition to being completely not your place to suggest, it most likely wouldn\u2019t even be possible because the father would be able to block it, and in most countries where arranged marriages are common it would just result in the kids languishing in an orphanage for the most critical periods of their development and potentially being separated from each other, a much worse outcome than whatever toxicity exists in their current home environment. Your brother in law also is included in the ESH for his absenteeism, and your parents for pressuring your sister into marriage.

Kids can feel that.

Any other possible solution.\nI could not imagine either having to sit and listen to my sister on the phone while she tells me over and over how much she regrets the kids. But won't divorce becouse struggling with the kids and Studying isn't for her. \nImagine listening.... again and again that this women regrets giving birth to her kids. It's pretty hard trying to be positive and encouraging when that's clearly not what the sister wants. She don't want to hear \"ohh you can do it.
