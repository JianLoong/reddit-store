It continued after my parents divorce when I was 7 and still happens today. My mom is fine with me getting back to her late because she knows how much this means to me.\n\nLast year my dad remarried and his wife brought two daughters into the marriage who are 5 and 4 years old now. A couple of weeks ago dad asked me if I would be okay with them joining us for the Friday ritual. I told him that I'd rather we keep it for just us, as father and son, and not have anyone else join in. He told me he understood but looked a little weird about it. I asked him if he was bothered by my not being okay with it. He told me he was okay, he had just hoped I might like to, but no was my answer and we would continue as normal.\n\nThe day after dad asked me about it his wife wanted to know why I'd said no. She told me she'd asked dad to bring the girls and he said he would need to talk to me first, but then suddenly said he'd decided it should be kept between me and him. She said she knew I was the one who said no and wanted to know the reason. I told her because it was my time with my dad and something we'd been doing for 12 years. She told me he's not just my dad anymore and I should want to include my sisters. I told her I didn't and she needed to not involve me in it.\n\nThe girls got upset when we did it last week then and their mom told me it was my fault and they had really felt left out and I should be ashamed for saying no to them joining.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670329601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze5ece/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_dont_want_to_share_our/", "score": 1124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Alone time with dad is a perfectly reasonable activity.  Sorry the girls felt left out, but that feeling was probably incited by mom.  Mom is being selfish and manipulative and is therefore the asshole.", "NTA. I don't know why they should suddenly be included in a thing you've always done w your dad. Seems your new step mom doesn't want you to have any alone time w him anymore. \n\nThey going to include you in things they do w only with their mom? I think not.", "NTA\n\nYour father can start a new tradition with his stepdaughters on a different day. His wife is out of line by trying to force this issue.", "NTA this is your thing.  If these other kids are getting \u201cupset\u201d it\u2019s because their mother is stirring them up.  That has to stop, and your dad needs to handle it.  If this woman is so desperate for her kids to hang out with him, they should start their own thing.\nIf I\u2019m reading this right you are 16? You have stuff to talk about and that isn\u2019t appropriate for 5 year olds.", "NTA. In a nuclear family sometime the parents spend time with each child individually to bond. Your dad can come up with something to do with his stepdaughters either individually or together. Given the age difference it doesn\u2019t make sense all of you going together so suggest to your SM that she come up with something you\u2019re dad can do with the younger kids", "NTA. \n\nHis wife is tho. Not only, did she ask your dad to take her daughters on your special bonding ritual but then she has the audacity to question your decision and complain about it. The sheer entitlement. \n\nW dad for not caving in tho.", "NTA. Stepmother is JEALOUS of the time you and your dad spend together. To stop it, she figured she would force dad to take the girls.\n\nAnd those girls didn't know anything about what was going on until stepmother said something to them. She made her kids upset!", "NTA.   YOu should get some alone time with your dad.   He should have time to have private conversations with you.", "Nta. You are allowed special time for just you and your dad. You do not have to include anyone else in it. Suggest to your dad that he do something separately with his step daughters. There is no reason they can't have their own thing without infringing on yours.", "Does the mom does anything with her daughters? \n\nAnd honestly keeping a ritual like that between parents and kids is really healthy. And makes you feel good after. Me and mom do that. It would feel werid if someone was there. \n\nNta", "NTA - it\u2019s bonding time for you and your dad. His stepchildren are 4 and 5 so he\u2019d probably end up looking after them more than talking with you. \n\nHe also respected your wishes and it clearly was important if he asked your thoughts.", "NTA\n\n\nIt's your special time with your Dad. He asked and you said no. He respected your wishes.\n\nYour new step Mom did not. You need to talk to your Dad and let him know what she has been saying and doing to you. I'm guessing she's saying these things to you  when your Dad isn't around?? That's not okay and he needs to be made aware of that.\n\nAlso he can pick another day and time to do an outing with his step daughters. There nothing wrong with them spending time with each other. Just like I'm sure at some point the three of you kids will have some activity or thing you guys do too. You can build new memories and activities and traditions without impeding and trampling on yours.", "NTA. He might be a stepdad now, but he\u2019s still **your** dad. It shouldn\u2019t be up to you to have this argument with your father\u2019s wife. He should do that himself.", "NTA.  Your dad can do something with them on another day.  He can do something with all three of you on a different day.  Having regular one-on-one time with each parent helps to deepen the relationship.  Not wanting the girls to join you does not mean you reject them. It just means you value that one-on-one time.", "NTA-He can make time to do something with his stepdaughters. This is your time alone with him.", "NTA. He can create a new tradition with them. This is your one on one time and it\u2019s important for your relationship. Adding little girls will change the dynamic entirely.\n\nAlso: he *is* just your dad. He\u2019s their stepdad and I assume have their own father.", "NTA, your dad took on some responsibility, yes, but you did not. It blows my mind how many parents on here seriously think the wants and desires of small children should dictate the behavior of the adults in the family. What happens when you want to go to prom, will they expect to bring your stepsisters because they're upset?", "NTA, the stepparents in these stories always amaze me. \nFirst, this is vital time for a dad and son. It\u2019s amazing that you two spend that kind of time together. Cherish it, it will at some point come to an end and those memories will be priceless. \nSecondly, they are young and cannot understand why this is important. They are upset because they are getting told no and most probably because the stepmom has manipulated them into being emotional about it. She could have been chill and the kids wouldn\u2019t have cared. \nAlso kudos to your dad for standing firm and keeping your time private.", "NTA. Even among non-blended families, good parents make an effort to spend one-on-one time with each of their children individually. Your stepmother shouldn't just expect to be able to insert your stepsisters into a ritual you & your father have exclusively shared for most of your life; that's completely unrealistic. \n\nSince you do have these extra siblings now that you didn't have before, though, it would be generous of you to let them accompany you both on occasion, maybe one week in three or every other week. It obviously means something to your dad that you accept your stepsisters, & given the age difference between you, it won't be long before you go out on your own as an adult anyway.", "NTA. This is something special between you and your dad,  time with just the two of you. I understand why you would want to keep it that way. Stepmom sure sounds like an AH, she needs to understand and see that this is something between you and your dad, father son bonding time.", "Nta your stepmom is a creep though, you're a teenager and if you don't want to hang out with her toddlers during your time with your dad that should be seen as normal and reasonable.", "NTA. This is special one-on-one time to talk with your dad. If you're getting milkshakes with a 3 and a 4 year old, trust me, you won't get a word in edgewise. \n\nStepmom sounds like she's shopping for trouble. He can go out with the little ones another night when you're at your moms. Stand your ground", "NTA, you didn't sign up to 2 step sisters and a step mom. it's your ritual and you have a 100% say in these matters. Your step mum should be more understanding towards your needs, and you should not be upset about saying no at all. I'm guessing you're around 16? and for a 16 year old you have a stronger sense of understanding as opposed to your step mum. Well done for setting boundaries, it's a good start. I would advise talking to your dad about this being your special thing, and a quality bonding session. I'm sure he'll understand the importance of this, and not include your step sisters, whilst also hopefully telling his wife the same", "NTA your ritual started before those kids were even born and this is something special for just the two of you. She can either start something separate between her kids and your dad, or something that all of you do together but hijacking your time with him is not cool", "NTA.\n\nWhy do some parents act as if they cannot find alternative methods, when it comes to things like this?\n\nNew traditions can be created. An ongoing tradition between two people doesn\u2019t need to be changed. Create new ones. \u201cDaddy and daughter dates\u201d on the weekends would be fine.", "NTA.  Not your sisters.", "NTA - bringing kids that young just changes the whole dynamic.  Instead of it being bonding time with you and your dad, you two would be babysitting the little girls the whole time.", "NTA\n\nYour dad could do something different with the girls on a different day. If step mom wants to try to build a relationship with you and the girls than maybe once a month you guys can do something with your dad.\n\nShe is trying to force a situation and should respect your time with your dad.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your dad have a lovely ritual that has only ever included you two. You are not obligated to invite your stepsisters.\n\nBut for the sake of family peace, could you come up with a second ritual that includes the girls? That way, you and he still have your very important father/son time together, and you can create another family tradition that your stepsisters are part of.", "NTA. I so wish I had had 1:1 time with my father growing up. I was in a large family and there wasn't enough of him to go around. You don't say how old you are, so it's difficukt to know how much longer your Dad time will continue before you're off to school or work.\n\nYour father is caught in the middle and your stepmother is forcing the issue.

It\u2019s completely reasonable for you to want to have one-on-one time with your father and for you to keep this time, in particular, between the two of you. \n\nYour SM is being unfair to you by putting pressure on you to change your mind and telling you it is your fault the girls are upset.

Also would be more meaningful full for the girls and easier to drop if a divorce happens! It\u2019s up to you if you want to suggest that, also I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if step-mum asked instead of daughters then actually promised or told them they\u2019d be allowed to go before your dad had told her no, obviously if they act spoilt and entitled usually i don\u2019t think it\u2019s that situation but if they are usually decent kids it might be that", "NTA.

Don't let the stepmother take this away from you two.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely NTA, I don't understand these YTA posts?\n\nThis is your time to hang out with your dad and bond, does he literally not have several other days and hours during the week to hang out with his new step-kids and create a new bond with them also? \n\nYou guys could also carve a small amount of time to maybe get ice-cream with your step-sisters, but it's not awful you want to keep this time for you and your dad.\n\nShame on your new step-mum for making you feel guilty about this, why is it so important for them to join something that you two have been doing for years? Are they not allowed to hang out any other time?", "NTA \n\nI have a 4 AND a 5 yr old! It would change the whole dynamic Op. No more in depth chats and one on one time with your dad! Keeping them entertained in restaurants is a whole thing. \n\nStepmom needs to understand that your dad can be a good stepparent but starting his own rituals with the girls that are *age appropriate* like taking them to the park, children\u2019s museum, play place or\nIce cream. That\u2019s how you bond with littles, not by sitting in a car talking near bed time or in the evening at this age. And I would tell her that if she continues to push! \n\nIf you all want to bond as a family, you can go out another time together for pizza or burgers etc. \nShe shouldn\u2019t infringe on your relationship with your dad.", "Why can\u2019t the dad do something with just the girls? Why is your time with him demanded?", "NTA OP. The kids, as young as they are, probably wouldn\u2019t have felt \u201cleft out\u201d if they hadn\u2019t been told by their manipulative mom what was going on. Don\u2019t let her gaslight you into including them. That\u2019s your time and she\u2019s just trying to guilt trip you into getting them out of the house for a little while. If the girls came you/your dad would end up babysitting instead of talking and that\u2019s exactly what she wants. Good on you for sticking to your original No.", "Ridiculous comment. What 16 year old boy wants to share his Friday father-son bonding time with a couple of pre-schoolers he hardly knows??\n\nThe only reason these kids are upset is because stepmom is threatened by her husband\u2019s bio-son. It would be easy to justify a few hours of alone time to kids this age. They can be bargained and reasoned with. The most obvious reason is that she is feeding comments to them about brother not wanting them to be with dad, etc.", "I guess OP father lives with the step siblings everyday while OP has a special time once a week where OP father can be fully focus on their relationship. \nOP NTA but step mother is a bad step mother and a bad mother", "There is nothing stopping the dad from doing this with his step kids on a different day. It shouldn\u2019t affect your day with your dad. Sounds like step mom just wants to cut down private time with your dad. You need to stand your ground and watch out for that.", "You should let your dad know that she confronted you. He may not know.

It is 100% healthy for you to have some regular solo time with your dad. These girls live with 7 days a week.  So there are plenty of weekend and evening hours for them to bond with your dad. \n\nIf stepmom was truly wanting the kids to bond with you, she wouldn\u2019t be stirring up drama with the kids and getting them upset with you.

This has ALWAYS been you and your dad's tradition. It would be rude of you to intrude on any traditions he may have with his stepdaughters if it was something special between them. My suggestion would be to start a new tradition with all of you kids. Maybe you all go get burgers on tuesdays or something idk. Something that is unique to you all as a \"new family unit.\" You shouldn't have to change your traditions and special bonding time with your dad just because someone else feels left out. If you also talk to the girls and explain why its meaningful to you (idk if that's something you would be comfortable doing if you even know them that well) then it may help them to understand that you DO want to spend time with them and your dad together but you also need that alone time as well.", "NTA\n\nDad should be making his own traditions with his new kids.

This is your time to decompress fully!", "NTA, stepmom is", " NTA he can setup a separate ritual with them. Also I hope you told your dad because that between them and not you. Remind your dad if needed that in a couple years you will be on college. These are memories you are building", "NTA. It\u2019s really important that your dad continues to give you your own time with him. He can develop a different tradition with his stepdaughters and/or traditions with the whole family.

That is something special between you too. If they want to do something with him he can do soemthing another day. You parents arent together and he is now married to someone else. I think its great he has a way to make you the center of his attention for that time.", "NTA and you're around 16, right? This is a great activity to do with your dad and it's really important for you to have private time together at this age.
