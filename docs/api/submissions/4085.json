It continued after my parents divorce when I was 7 and still happens today. My mom is fine with me getting back to her late because she knows how much this means to me.\n\nLast year my dad remarried and his wife brought two daughters into the marriage who are 5 and 4 years old now. A couple of weeks ago dad asked me if I would be okay with them joining us for the Friday ritual. I told him that I'd rather we keep it for just us, as father and son, and not have anyone else join in. He told me he understood but looked a little weird about it. I asked him if he was bothered by my not being okay with it. He told me he was okay, he had just hoped I might like to, but no was my answer and we would continue as normal.\n\nThe day after dad asked me about it his wife wanted to know why I'd said no. She told me she'd asked dad to bring the girls and he said he would need to talk to me first, but then suddenly said he'd decided it should be kept between me and him. She said she knew I was the one who said no and wanted to know the reason. I told her because it was my time with my dad and something we'd been doing for 12 years. She told me he's not just my dad anymore and I should want to include my sisters. I told her I didn't and she needed to not involve me in it.\n\nThe girls got upset when we did it last week then and their mom told me it was my fault and they had really felt left out and I should be ashamed for saying no to them joining.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670329601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze5ece/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_dont_want_to_share_our/", "score": 358, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Alone time with dad is a perfectly reasonable activity.  Sorry the girls felt left out, but that feeling was probably incited by mom.  Mom is being selfish and manipulative and is therefore the asshole.", "NTA. I don't know why they should suddenly be included in a thing you've always done w your dad. Seems your new step mom doesn't want you to have any alone time w him anymore. \n\nThey going to include you in things they do w only with their mom? I think not.", "NTA\n\nYour father can start a new tradition with his stepdaughters on a different day. His wife is out of line by trying to force this issue.", "NTA this is your thing.  If these other kids are getting \u201cupset\u201d it\u2019s because their mother is stirring them up.  That has to stop, and your dad needs to handle it.  If this woman is so desperate for her kids to hang out with him, they should start their own thing.\nIf I\u2019m reading this right you are 16? You have stuff to talk about and that isn\u2019t appropriate for 5 year olds.", "NTA. In a nuclear family sometime the parents spend time with each child individually to bond. Your dad can come up with something to do with his stepdaughters either individually or together. Given the age difference it doesn\u2019t make sense all of you going together so suggest to your SM that she come up with something you\u2019re dad can do with the younger kids", "NTA. \n\nHis wife is tho. Not only, did she ask your dad to take her daughters on your special bonding ritual but then she has the audacity to question your decision and complain about it. The sheer entitlement. \n\nW dad for not caving in tho.", "NTA. Stepmother is JEALOUS of the time you and your dad spend together. To stop it, she figured she would force dad to take the girls.\n\nAnd those girls didn't know anything about what was going on until stepmother said something to them. She made her kids upset!", "NTA.   YOu should get some alone time with your dad.   He should have time to have private conversations with you.", "Nta. You are allowed special time for just you and your dad. You do not have to include anyone else in it. Suggest to your dad that he do something separately with his step daughters. There is no reason they can't have their own thing without infringing on yours.", "Does the mom does anything with her daughters? \n\nAnd honestly keeping a ritual like that between parents and kids is really healthy. And makes you feel good after. Me and mom do that. It would feel werid if someone was there. \n\nNta", "NTA - it\u2019s bonding time for you and your dad. His stepchildren are 4 and 5 so he\u2019d probably end up looking after them more than talking with you. \n\nHe also respected your wishes and it clearly was important if he asked your thoughts.", "NTA\n\n\nIt's your special time with your Dad. He asked and you said no. He respected your wishes.\n\nYour new step Mom did not. You need to talk to your Dad and let him know what she has been saying and doing to you. I'm guessing she's saying these things to you  when your Dad isn't around?? That's not okay and he needs to be made aware of that.\n\nAlso he can pick another day and time to do an outing with his step daughters. There nothing wrong with them spending time with each other. Just like I'm sure at some point the three of you kids will have some activity or thing you guys do too. You can build new memories and activities and traditions without impeding and trampling on yours.", "NTA. He might be a stepdad now, but he\u2019s still **your** dad. It shouldn\u2019t be up to you to have this argument with your father\u2019s wife. He should do that himself.", "NTA.  Your dad can do something with them on another day.  He can do something with all three of you on a different day.  Having regular one-on-one time with each parent helps to deepen the relationship.  Not wanting the girls to join you does not mean you reject them. It just means you value that one-on-one time.", "NTA-He can make time to do something with his stepdaughters. This is your time alone with him.", "NTA. He can create a new tradition with them. This is your one on one time and it\u2019s important for your relationship. Adding little girls will change the dynamic entirely.\n\nAlso: he *is* just your dad. He\u2019s their stepdad and I assume have their own father.", "NTA, your dad took on some responsibility, yes, but you did not. It blows my mind how many parents on here seriously think the wants and desires of small children should dictate the behavior of the adults in the family. What happens when you want to go to prom, will they expect to bring your stepsisters because they're upset?", "NTA, the stepparents in these stories always amaze me. \nFirst, this is vital time for a dad and son. It\u2019s amazing that you two spend that kind of time together. Cherish it, it will at some point come to an end and those memories will be priceless. \nSecondly, they are young and cannot understand why this is important. They are upset because they are getting told no and most probably because the stepmom has manipulated them into being emotional about it. She could have been chill and the kids wouldn\u2019t have cared. \nAlso kudos to your dad for standing firm and keeping your time private.", "NTA. Even among non-blended families, good parents make an effort to spend one-on-one time with each of their children individually. Your stepmother shouldn't just expect to be able to insert your stepsisters into a ritual you & your father have exclusively shared for most of your life; that's completely unrealistic. \n\nSince you do have these extra siblings now that you didn't have before, though, it would be generous of you to let them accompany you both on occasion, maybe one week in three or every other week. It obviously means something to your dad that you accept your stepsisters, & given the age difference between you, it won't be long before you go out on your own as an adult anyway.", "NTA. This is something special between you and your dad,  time with just the two of you. I understand why you would want to keep it that way. Stepmom sure sounds like an AH, she needs to understand and see that this is something between you and your dad, father son bonding time.", "Nta your stepmom is a creep though, you're a teenager and if you don't want to hang out with her toddlers during your time with your dad that should be seen as normal and reasonable.", "NTA. This is special one-on-one time to talk with your dad. If you're getting milkshakes with a 3 and a 4 year old, trust me, you won't get a word in edgewise. \n\nStepmom sounds like she's shopping for trouble. He can go out with the little ones another night when you're at your moms. Stand your ground", "NTA, you didn't sign up to 2 step sisters and a step mom. it's your ritual and you have a 100% say in these matters. Your step mum should be more understanding towards your needs, and you should not be upset about saying no at all. I'm guessing you're around 16? and for a 16 year old you have a stronger sense of understanding as opposed to your step mum. Well done for setting boundaries, it's a good start. I would advise talking to your dad about this being your special thing, and a quality bonding session. I'm sure he'll understand the importance of this, and not include your step sisters, whilst also hopefully telling his wife the same", "NTA your ritual started before those kids were even born and this is something special for just the two of you. She can either start something separate between her kids and your dad, or something that all of you do together but hijacking your time with him is not cool", "NTA.\n\nWhy do some parents act as if they cannot find alternative methods, when it comes to things like this?\n\nNew traditions can be created. An ongoing tradition between two people doesn\u2019t need to be changed. Create new ones. \u201cDaddy and daughter dates\u201d on the weekends would be fine.", "NTA.  Not your sisters.", "NTA - bringing kids that young just changes the whole dynamic.  Instead of it being bonding time with you and your dad, you two would be babysitting the little girls the whole time.", "NTA\n\nYour dad could do something different with the girls on a different day. If step mom wants to try to build a relationship with you and the girls than maybe once a month you guys can do something with your dad.\n\nShe is trying to force a situation and should respect your time with your dad.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your dad have a lovely ritual that has only ever included you two. You are not obligated to invite your stepsisters.\n\nBut for the sake of family peace, could you come up with a second ritual that includes the girls? That way, you and he still have your very important father/son time together, and you can create another family tradition that your stepsisters are part of.", "NTA. I so wish I had had 1:1 time with my father growing up. I was in a large family and there wasn't enough of him to go around. You don't say how old you are, so it's difficukt to know how much longer your Dad time will continue before you're off to school or work.\n\nYour father is caught in the middle and your stepmother is forcing the issue.

It\u2019s completely reasonable for you to want to have one-on-one time with your father and for you to keep this time, in particular, between the two of you. \n\nYour SM is being unfair to you by putting pressure on you to change your mind and telling you it is your fault the girls are upset.

Also would be more meaningful full for the girls and easier to drop if a divorce happens! It\u2019s up to you if you want to suggest that, also I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if step-mum asked instead of daughters then actually promised or told them they\u2019d be allowed to go before your dad had told her no, obviously if they act spoilt and entitled usually i don\u2019t think it\u2019s that situation but if they are usually decent kids it might be that", "NTA.

She is out of order.", "NTA\n\nThe bonding time with a father and son is very important and you should feel free to discuss what you want to with him without tiny ears listening in or feeling like you have to censor yourself.  He can make time for his new daughters a different day and start a new tradition with them.", "NTA- it's total reasonable for you to want alone time with your dad and this tradition has been going on for 12 years. It's something you both look forward to.  Maybe suggest that the girls and the mom start their tradition while you are doing yours with your dad, or maybe start a new tradition with all of you that doesn't interfere with yours.", "Fridays are for you and your dad.  Is there another day of the week (or perhaps twice a month) when all three of you go do something with Dad?  The girls are the innocent victims of their mother\u2019s manipulative tactics.\n\nNTA", "Nta but your dad should 100% be doing their own ritual. Like, I don't know, ice cream on Wednesday.", "NTA and you need to have a talk with your dad letting him know that she's continually coming at you about this and making you feel really uncomfortable. As it sounds like he's a good dad, I promise you he would WANT to know and would likely feel terrible if he thought you were hiding it from him.", "NTA.  next time your stepmother goes anywhere with your stepsisters, throw a huge fit and cry and accuse her of not including you", "Hard NTA.\n\nThere's zero justification for her to insist on coopting your father/son time. Nor for expecting you to want to include a first grader and preschooler in much of your life at all, really. And she should realize that trying to force her perfectly smoothly blended family fantasy in you will only make things worse.", "Your Dad can start a different ritual with his stepdaughters. You're 16 years old, based on the info you've provided, and the things you and your dad enjoy together are different from what two little girls would enjoy. So maybe he needs a Wednesday evening ritual, or a Saturday afternoon ritual, when he takes them out for a little girl activity - because if they join you they won't just share what you and he gave, they'll change it completely.\nNTA - protect this time. It's important!", "Yet another stepparent trying to force bonding in a bad way. NTA", "NTA.  It sounds like she just wants to be rid of all of you for a few hours so she can have some alone time.  That's understandable, but it's not *your* problem.\n\nIf she's really concerned that her daughters feel left out, she can do something special with them at the same time.  FTR, I'm a stepmother.", "NTA\nYour dad needs to grow a spine and tell his wife that its private ritual between the two of you, rather than pinning it on you by saying... she wanted to know why *you* didnt want to involved the girls. \nYouve said no they can't join in, there is no why.\nAlso to any one with common sense its perfectly clear why you don't want to share this time, and absolutely reasonable too.\n\nAlso, her children arent his children, she needs to get over herself.\n\nYou are not in the wrong, stay strong", "NTA - dad can do something similar with the girls on any other day. It's totally fine that you want to spend this day alone with him. Stepmom needs to respect you too.", "NTA but just tell your dad to do that with them separately, on a different day. Her kids are 4 and 5. There\u2019s a good chance they could have a great relationship with your dad too.", "Step mom can take her kids out for some quality time. Problem solved. NTA", "NTA. You getting some time with your dad is very reasonable. Your stepmom is pushy, overbearing, and manipulative.", "It appears that you are a teenage boy and they want you to include a four and five year old girl?\nNTA at all.\nThat\u2019s completely understandable.\nNot only do you need time alone with your dad, including kids this young would completely change the dynamics.\nDid can start a new tradition with just them.\nDad is not an A.H. For asking but would be if he pushes.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to start a new ritual with the girls that is just them. But you're allowed to have your own special time with him.", "NAH\n\nBut, imagine it the other way around. If you got a new step-parent / sibling that you genuinely loved very much, then one of those people told you that they don't want to share something they enjoy doing with you. Would you feel hurt, like they may not really care about you?", "From experience, I can say it doesn\u2019t work either. My stepson\u2019s Dad has two other younger children and really pushed my boy to interact a lot with his younger siblings. His weekends at his Dad\u2019s were always \u2018family time\u2019 to make up for the siblings not seeing each other during the week. He never really got one on one time with his Dad.\n\nNow he\u2019s 14, and doesn\u2019t want to go to his Dad\u2019s anymore. Feels forced to play with much younger children, and doesn\u2019t really feel he has a personal relationship with his Dad.\n\nIt\u2019s sad, but we tried to warn his Dad, he would get better for a bit and then revert.\n\nKudos to OPs Dad for working to protect their relationship!", "It absolutely was my mom did this all the time. My aunt and went to Disneyland and invited my other aunt and my cousin to go with them. My mom found and told us that we we'rent good enough to invite ans that were the black sheep of the family. What I knew even at 12 though, was that it wasn't a free trip. My other aunt was more than likely expected to pay her way for her and her son so it was more just an invite and not an all expense paid trip so I didn't take the bait from her. But her intention was to make everyone know that we were being excluded on purpose. Why? I don't know. She just always thought everyone was being mean to her.", "Exactly my thoughts...and whats stopping dad from making his own tradition with the stepdaughters.", "Yeah that's what I can't get past. The little ones are going to sit quietly while they talk about colleges? There's no common interest here except food. The only reason the kids feel left out is because Mom said dad went for a special drive to get pizza and milkshakes and you aren't invited.", "I can't imagine feeling hurt but I only know this from being older and being more interested in the relationship with my dad than with his wife or stepkids.", "No.", "Nta. She wants a free night to herself i bet.  Its not about the bonding between the girls and your dad.", "Find it hard to believe the girls were all of a sudden upset about this trip without some prompting (manipulation) from their mother", "NTA, don't discuss this with your Dad's wife or your stepsisters anymore. This is for him to handle, don't make this your battle.", "Please let your Dad know what your stepmother is saying to you.", "Nothing is stopping your dad from doing this ritual for the girls without you. What I mean is, he can do the ritual with you and he can do the ritual with them. The mom is being an ass about it trying to guilt you.", "Why doesn't she take her girls out at the same time OP and dad are out?", "That\u2019s the ticket!!", "Please do this", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
