I love her and everything was going well until this argument.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI am very lucky to be born in a rich family, so my parents used to have a maid to do the housework, Maria (57F). She has been working for my parents since I'm 7 and became a family friend. For example we were all invited to the wedding of her daughther. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nLast year, my parents took a well deserved retirement and enjoy some trips, visit family etc, so since last year, they have spent very little time at home, so Maria didn't have much work to do in their home. My parents proposed to have Maria as a maid for my apartment. I gladly approved because I love Maria, and usually I am very tired after work, so it is nice to have someone to take care of the home. Maria was also happy to keep working for us. My parents insisted to cover the whole wage of Maria until the end of my residency, even if I could do it (she earns about 2.5 times minimal salary in my country)\n\n\r  \n\r  \nAmy comes from a more modest background and doesn't understand the principle of having a maid. She doesn't want Maria to iron her clothes, or tidying her stuff. I thought she wasn't used too but Amy seems to dislike Maria for some reason. Here is the conflict\u00a0: yesterday, Maria came to work and especially clean the bathroom, Amy was supposed to be at work, but she was showering and didn't put the lock, you know the rest. Amy got angry at Maria and yelled at her. Maria called me to explain me the incident, she told me she apologized and tried to say she thought Amy was at work  that she rang the bell before entering with her key.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nWhen I came home, Amy was still angry, she says Maria is sneaky and creepy and that I should fire and we should just split chores. I try to calm her down and told that maybe she was overreacting, but she is having none of it. Honestly, I don't want to ditch Maria, I have total trust in her, she is almost family to me, also, I know I sound a bit lazy but, both Amy and I have pretty demanding jobs so dealing with chores after work would be tiring. Furthermore, it would without doubt upset my parents. I tried to explain all of this to Amy but she called me an egoistical and lazy AH, she said that I choose Maria instead of her and her comfort. She is now giving me the cold shoulder.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI feel bad about this, I talked about it with my friends.

You need to confront the GF and ask her what her actual issue is because Maria hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Then go from there. I would guess your GF is going to deflect back to Maria and if she won\u2019t actually talk about what\u2019s bothering her decide where to go from there. The rest of your relationship will be like this, are you prepared to deal with it? Maria\u2019s done nothing wrong though.", "NTA.  Amy shows no compassion to people who you deem as trustworthy and have been with you for a while.  You are getting the preview of what she\u2019s like when she doesn\u2019t get her way.  The way she yelled at Maria shows how she treats people.  You\u2019re not the asshole.  She is. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Wow, I\u2019m amazed that you even need to ask this. You are definitely NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds like an entitled monster without any regard for the livelihood and emotions of other. \n\nI\u2019d keep the maid and get rid of your girlfriend", "NTA.  Congrats for being able to afford housekeeping.  \n\nHousekeeping, chefs, landscapers\u2026.  those are better life enhancements than expensive toys nobody else can play with.  Hopefully someday, we all taste the joys of extra time.", "I\u2019m going with NAH though Amy\u2019s response of Maria being creepy and you being lazy was uncalled for. I think Amy is uncomfortable. You\u2019ve had Maria in your life since you were a child. Amy\u2019s had her in her life for like 20 days.  This has to be strange for her. Maybe set up some boundaries (job duties) together. What tasks you want Maria to do and which you don\u2019t. You are both benefitting from this. To let her go and split the chores is going to leave neither of you any time to relax or spend time together. Include a set schedule for Maria so Amy isn\u2019t surprised when she shows up.", "NTA\n\n\"she says Maria is sneaky and creepy and that I should fire and we should just split chores.\"\n\nI could be off here, but it seems she has trust issues more than you being \"lazy.\" That seems a little weird to me given the context of Maria that you gave, as she is not just a random maid. There is nothing wrong with hiring a maid, and especially in the context you provided.", "NTA, but I can tell you I would NOT want a maid under any circumstances.  It would be uncomfortable at best and I imagine your gf is hating having her around.\n\nAs an aside, everyone's jobs are exhausting and chores suck.  It's life.  And that's likely why your gf doesn't see this as a good reason to keep a maid.", "NTA\n\nYou are in a residency program and are understandably tired. Your family wants to help you and  help Maria, something they can afford to do. \n\nI honestly don't see the problem.\n\nIf the problem is that you are wealthier than Amy then that problem is not going to go away, and and I'm pretty sure that you want to continue living what is probably an American upper middle class lifestyle. \n\nAmy is going to have to adjust or I don't see how this can work out.", "NTA. Although I do understand her not wanting her\nstuff to be touched, personally I don\u2019t like anyone touching my clothes/items apart from my partner. The bathroom thing a genuine misunderstanding I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for her to say Maria is a creep.", "Wow. Amy is sure taking this having a maid thing badly. I personally would love one. With my problems taking care of myself is a challenge. \n\nI was thinking about it as I read. Amy may have no idea what Maria is supposed to do. She needs to understand that this is Maria\u2019s job, and she is a professional. Have you asked Amy why she wants to see Maria unemployed?  Sounds like you can only keep one of them. The choice seems pretty straightforward.", "NTA.", "NAH however for the sake of your relationship you need to communicate some boundaries with Maria.  Maria has NOT been a part of your girlfriend's family for years.  She is a complete stranger to your GF, and you are expecting GF to be okay with a complete stranger rifling through her clothes and trash and etc.  I realize to you it's not \"rifling through\" but it is to your GF.  Tell Maria to leave your GF's clothes and space alone for now, and make sure Maria is there during a set schedule so that your GF knows when to expect her.  A stranger barging in on you in the shower is mortifying and definitely can feel very creepy.  Boundaries would resolve this issue very easily.  Maria is there to work - treat her like it and don't expect your GF to act like she is family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am a little surprised at going with NTA after the title but it seems to fit!", "I can see both sides. In Amy\u2019s mind, Maria is a like family figure, even though she\u2019s hired. That could be understandably difficult for her, as you\u2019re both young, and she\u2019s likely trying to strike out on her own, and differentiate herself from family, be independent. Maids do see everything. A good one says nothing, but she IS on your parent\u2019s pay. Also, since she\u2019s from a modest background, she likely wants to see that you can take care of yourself. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you can take care of yourself on your own- ordinarily that would be a problem but it also sounds like you are wealthy enough to not have to, so, I can understand that you love Maria. Heck, I would love to have a maid, I used to be one, it\u2019s a blessing if you can afford it. And she\u2019s close to you from childhood. Given both sides of the situation, I would choose Maria over the girlfriend, if it comes down to a choice. \n\nYour girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong though. But you should probably dump her and find one who is good with Maria. If I were you. What a sick world we live in. I hate this question. NTA.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve never hired housecleaning services it can feel strange to have non family members in your home. You and your GF can talk through that. A lot of middle class Americans who hire cleaners just have them clean but do tidying themselves so it can feel invasive when someone else handles clothes. But there is nothing wrong with hiring people for domestic work as long as the pay is fair. Plus you are doing a residency. That\u2019s exhausting and stressful.", "NTA.  You've had a lifetime with Maria, your GF is insecure, class conscious and jealous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep Maria, and tell your GF she is not allowed to yell at or abuse your family's companion.  If she continues - let the GF go, not worth your time.  She's literally jealous of Maria and that is not ok or acceptable.", "NTA: You and your girlfriend are incompatible. Sounds like too much of a social class difference to be honest. A lot of people from lower/middle income backgrounds are vehemently opposed to having a maid/housekeeper and look down on it. It sounds like your GF is like this.", "A maid so trusted that they\u2019re almost like a family member is super rare. Girlfriends like Amy who like to pass judgment on lifestyles she doesn\u2019t nor tries to understand are a dime a dozen. Looks like Amy is about to be an ex girlfriend. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI think Amy isn\u2019t comfortable with having a maid since it\u2019s not something she is used too but she knew that Maria was there prior to her moving into your apartment. She cannot give ultimatums because it is YOUR space still. You can make it known to Maria to not touch Amy\u2019s things so that she can do her own chores. Maria is like family to you & obviously her family treats you the same since you were invited to her daughters wedding. What is Maria going to do if she\u2019s fired especially since she\u2019s been with your family for so long?", "NAH\n\nThere is having boundaries and then there\u2019s telling you to fire someone who has been with your family for 20 years who is basically and aunt by how you\u2019ve described your relationship with her and her family. Also basically saying cutting off her income that, if I read your post right, is 2.5x higher than a lot of people would be getting. If that\u2019s a fair wage, no idea, but Maria seems happy with it.  \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want her stuff touched, I wouldn\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine. Just show Maria what\u2019s hers and that Amy would prefer to clean the things that are hers. If she wouldn\u2019t want her in your shared bedroom, I feel that\u2019s another boundary that is reasonable. Just put things like laundry in a basket outside the door.\n\nEdit: forgot NAH was an option. Changed it.", "You are NTA, especially if you show the girlfriend the door and keep the maid. Do make a point of tidying up after yourself so her cleaning work is easier.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nInfo: is the shower room (bathroom?) soundproof? Is this how Maria entered a room with a closed (not locked) door while Amy was showering?", "NTA.  Sneaky and creepy? That sounds a little over-the-top. Any chance Maria is a different race than you two?", "NAH.  I\u2019m sure your gf is more mad/embarrassed about the maid entering the bathroom at the wrong time than anything else.  And it sounds like a temporary situation until your parents get back, so this may resolve itself.\n\nBut if push comes to shove and your gf makes an ultimatum, pick the more useful of the two\u2026", "NTA. You can\u2019t fire anybody for just doing their job. Especially almost family. If your gf can\u2019t and won\u2019t show compassion then perhaps it\u2019s the gf who should be fired.", "NTA. I'm from a Latin American country where both the highest and lowest classes would agree nothing is tackier than to get rid of the trusted staff that has seen the family's children grow. \n\nYour parents found a way to lighten Maria's load now that she is older. She went from cleaning a big house to cleaning an apartment with only two people. She is doing everything she can to do it while your gf is out in order not to be a bother; your gf should be more understanding of a 57 year old woman who still wants to earn her bread by doing honest work. \n\nIf you were in my country, your parents would dislike your gf just for calling Maria creepy after she spent DECADES respecting their privacy and home, and that would apply even if she was the richest, poshest of them all.", "NTA. Your gf is strange. I'd be thrilled to have a housekeeper that my rich bfs parents paid for!", "NTA your girlfriend should be grateful she even has a maid lol", "NTA- my heart breaks for Maria who was just trying to do her job. \n\nYour gf\u2019s inferiority complex over  your family\u2019s ability to afford a maid isn\u2019t your problem and she should not be taking it out on Maria.", "NTA. Your arrangement with Maria is a long-standing one and Amy needs to accept it or she can move out. It\u2019s OK if your girlfriend wants to take care of her own personal stuff but she gets no say about the rest of the house.", "NTA she knew Maria was there when she agreed to move in. What is the split for expenses?", "NTA. From what you wrote, Maria doesn't sound creepy and she has been part of your life forever. I've had a maid, and I know how hard it is to find someone you trust. Additionally, that would create problems for you AND for your parents. Amy is thinking about herself. Which would be OK as long as she didn't try to direct your behaviour. For example, she could say \"I'd rather wash and iron my clothes myself\". But the moment she pushes for you to do house chores you don't want to do, you have a reasonable reason for not doing (demanding job), AND you have the money to be able to afford a maid for, I see red flags shining bright.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a gf problem. You need to fix that.", "NTA \nI understand your gf maybe not being used to have a maid and finding it weird, BUT you have a responsibility towards your employee of nearly 20 years and even though you maybe legally could fire her, you shouldn\u2019t! As she is part of your family as you have stated yourself.\nYou need to have a talk with gf that you respect certain parts of her wishes aka Maria not touching her things, but that the relationship with Maria is way longer, keeping her employed is your responsibility, plus you don\u2019t want to do chores. So gf needs to find it in herself to compromise.\n\nPS: I have a cleaning lady since more than 10 years. I love her dearly. She saves me from living in a mess. She is also getting older so I pay her more these days, bc she needs longer. And I am putting money aside monthly so at some point I can send her into \u201cearly retirement\u201d aka me paying her still for a while, while she is not working for me anymore.Be kind to the people who work for you and make your life easier!", "NAH \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, your girlfriend knew about Maria being your maid (housekeeper?) before she moved in. And I absolutely think it\u2019s good you don\u2019t want to leave Maria hanging.\n\nBut I also get her point of view, I personally wouldn\u2019t want a maid. I don\u2019t think maids are nosy, creepy people **at all**, but I would not want someone who isn\u2019t me or my partner to see my dirty underwear, and my trash etc.\n\nYou have to understand that while Maria is like a family member to you, she\u2019s basically a stranger to Amy.\n\nThe bathroom incident was unfortunate, but imo your girlfriend\u2019s fault - the schedule was clearly communicated. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to sit down and solve this issue. If Amy absolutely does not want to ever have a maid work for her, and if you absolutely always want to have a maid work for you, maybe you\u2019re not that compatible. But maybe you\u2019ll also be able to solve that issue!", "NTA. But I would sit down girlfriend and ask her wtf is this really about, Maria is just doing her job, if your girl doesn\u2019t likes it, she doesn\u2019t has to live there.", "NTA. How does Amy treat the wait staff at restaurants? She's giving you an ultimatum. That's not a healthy response in a relationship.", "NTA but Amy is", "NAH you can both have differences on opinion but I will say that if you hired Maria while your gf was already living with you, your heading into ah territory. You can\u2019t just unilaterally decide to have a whole person at your apartment for multiple hours a day. Was there even a discussion?", "NTA\n\nI'm under the assumption Maria entered the apartment with her key not the bathroom your gf was showering in. If it was the bathroom then you need to speak with Maria about boundaries.", "NTA at all. Maria depends on this job, especially at her age she would not be able to find anything comparable, and Amy sounds high maintenance. But please be careful because Amy sounds like she will try to run Maria off, and that is not a relationship you should lose. Amy knew the situation when she moved in so she can get on board or leave. Compassion and perspective are must have qualities in a relationship.", "Tell us more about your personal feelings about maids, it\u2019s very relevant.", "But why do boundaries need to be communicated if Amy was supposed to be at work and Maria rang the bell BEFORE entering the house? I feel like OP is already doing everything he can to make the situation more comfortable for Amy, but she flipped over an innocent mistake. Would I have walked into the bathroom if I heard the shower running? Hell no! I would\u2019ve knocked but what if the shower was already turned off and there was no obvious noise coming from the bathroom? I would\u2019ve walked in to do my job and clean. Amy seems insecure for some reason that I can\u2019t put my finger on \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No, Amy needs to get over herself or move on! She doesn't get to mobe in an dictate how things go.... this is still his apartment not Amy's!", "There is already a schedule, so we know when Maria is coming and what she will do, and who is at home. Amy was supposed to be at work, but she told me she took the day off because she was tired. That's why Maria didn't expect to see Amy", ">Your girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong though\n\nThe girlfriend is being rude and unpleasant to this innocent woman for who has done nothing wrong. Of course she is wrong.", "I'm poor and would love to afford a housekeeper! Lol", "I will guess that she was about to shower or just finish showering, so there were no noise.", "No, we are all white", "The thought crossed my mind as well. I\u2019m wondering if racial stereotypes could be a factor.", "No it's been a year since Maria works at my apartment, Amy moved in 2 months ago and she already knew about Maria", "It could be.  It may be where GF is coming from but failing to communicate. \n\nStarting off living with a partner and a stranger regularly comes into your private space-  I know not everyone is gonna have an issue with that, but some people would, and GF might be one of them.", "They are just providing context for why someone might not like a maid. I would hate to never be alone in my home.", "Wait so she knew she was coming, specifically to clean the bathroom and still took a shower while conveniently leaving the bathroom door unlocked? Question does Maria listen to music while working? If not she should have heard the shower running, if she didn\u2019t hear it then was Amy already out the shower and drying off? This seems way too much of a coincidence to me and seems a bit like Amy might have set Maria up.", "I would have guessed that also, but OP specifically states, \u201cbut she was showering\u201d so I questioned it.\n\nIt\u2019s been 35+ years since I\u2019ve lived in apartments, but I recall being able to hear the shower water running from any point within the apartment. I\u2019m in a 4-bedroom house now, and I can hear the shower water in the rear bath running, from the front door. \n\nNo matter. OP is still NTA.", "Well, at least it's not that. Still, it's an odd statement without any evidence.", "Damn same, immediately thought it was a race thing based on the girlfriend\u2019s accusations.", "So your girlfriend knows about Maria and knows her schedule. You\u2019re NTA, but your girlfriend, unfortunately, is.", "They come, do their job then they leave. Just how do you think this works?", "NTA. Amy can look down on the maid all she wants but she\u2019s earning an honest living doing hard work and she earns that pay. She depends on you for job security. If you were to fire her after all her years of working for your family you would be a massive AH. Amy can get her own place and do her own chores", "I like Maria but not Amy.", "NTA\n\nAmy sucks.", "Nta. My mil is a maid has been for 40+ years. She came over from Mexico in the 80s and has been here ever since. She is the most hardworking woman I've met. She took me in when I was dating her son, who is now my husband. I'd go work with her cleaning houses. She'd work 5 days a week with at least 10 clients a week. She worked in the affluent neighborhoods, so the houses were big. The work is hard and tedious. She's like family to each of her clients. Some of her clients have moved across town, and she still cleans for them. A good maid is hard to come by, especially one like Maria. I'd keep the maid and fire your gf.", "She\u2019s been working since you\u2019re 7, and now you\u2019re 25. If it\u2019s me, she\u2019s already a family. In my country, I would even call her my aunt. Of course she\u2019s doing houseworks and chores, but she\u2019s doing it with respect from both side of her and your family, and love too.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not gonna tell you to break up with your gf immediately. But you guys definitely need a serious talk. In life mistakes always happen. Knowing when to apologize and when to forgive will always be very important. If she cannot forgive for even such a simple mistake, what else gonna happened next? Is she also gonna tell you to ditch your friends for such a simple mistake? Or your family next?\n\nWanting to do houseworks yourself are definitely not a reason to fire Maria. If anything, you can have her teach you to do them more efficiently, and she can also catch your slacks when you\u2019re really really busy.\n\nNTA", "NTA  It sounds like Amy is having a hard time adjusting to your lifestyle and feels like an outsider. It's not that she doesn't like Maria but that Maria is a constant reminder of how different you two are. You need to sit her down to find out if she can fully accept you as you are because you won't be changing.", "NTA. It is not okay to accuse a lady who has worked for your family all your life sneaky and creepy cause she comes in to do the job she gets paid for. That would absolutely make me question your girlfriend's integrity. It's one thing to not be used to having a housekeeper, it's an entirely different thing to vindictively try to get rid of a person who has been honest and reliable for two decades.", "NTA. Maria is part of the family and your girlfriend doesn't like that. I think it might be time to find another girlfriend.", "NTA. You have known Maria since you were a child. You trust her like family. And your family is her employer. What a shame that Amy is being so childish.", "NTA: You trust Maria and it seems like this is at the point the line between employee and family is blurred. Normally I support equal division of housework but if she drives Maria away, do not agree to do half the chores. (If Maria retires, that\u2019s a different story)", "NTA - I hope someday I date someone rich enough to have a maid. A part of me honestly can't believe your gf WANTS to do chores on top of having a full time job. \n\nSomeone else doing chores? For free?

Maria is beyond \u201ca maid\u201d to you. She\u2019s been a part of your life for 18 years. You\u2019d be a monster to fire her now. Amy is jealous and has no empathy. She seems quite cruel actually. I don\u2019t think I would want to be In a relationship with someone like her. NTA", "NTA... if your girlfriend is not comfortable living in this environment maybe she should continue to live in her own home.", "Look I understand being uncomfortable with the idea of having a maid, I think I would be too both because of privacy and because I\u2019d feel weird about the dynamic.\n\nHowever, what I wouldn\u2019t do is yell at that person and try to get them fired! I\u2019d probably just clean my own space and ask they don\u2019t touch it and then tip extra because I feel guilty or something.", "NTA. Having maids is kind of the common thing in my country,  and one of the first things you notice and comment on about people is how they treat those that work to help you in your everyday life. Someone who treats maids poorly is someone you immediately question your need for a relationship with, be it a new friend or possible partner. This being because, just as you said, most of them have grown up with us and are considered family; you don\u2019t disrepect family or tolerate it when others do. At best your gf has poor manners, at worst she is a cruel person.", "NTA - I\u2019d keep Maria over gf because Maria makes your life easier. I have cleaners come in to clean the house and do laundry. If they open the bathroom door because they thought we aren\u2019t home it\u2019s not a big deal. I love having a clean house and laundry done. The amazing smell of fabuloso and a clean kitchen. \n\nI bet if GF gave Maria a little niceness Maria would be happy to welcome in the next generation.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is overreacting a bit in this sitch.You are also disgustingly rich, which makes me hate you a bit, but she is overreacting nonetheless. That being said, some people are out here making her seem like the devil. I too would be wildly uncomfortable in this sitch. Maria is not my family. She is a stranger to me. I\u2019m not used to having strangers do my chores. I 100% don\u2019t expect a stranger to walk in on me when I\u2019m home alone in the shower. I would be very upset too. And maybe Maria is creepy, but you\u2019re not picking up on it cause she\u2019s your normal. It\u2019s like how guys will be like \u201cTony\u2019s a good guy\u201d and then Tony turns out to be a serial rapists and abuser. You might not know cause she\u2019s your \u201cbud\u201d but to Amy she\u2019s spooky. I get why amy is upset and uncomfortable, but instead of throwing Maria into unemployment, you could find an easy solution between the two of you. Like maybe they exchange contacts and communicate so that this kind of thing doesn\u2019t happen again. There is a solution.", "NTA keep the maid, dump the gf. She sounds awful. Don't let your GF treat your maid and any other people badly.", "Yelling at 60 year old maid.\n\ndamn please dump your GF.\n\nshe sounds horrible. IDK how no one is talking about it.", "> I try to calm her down and told that maybe she was overreacting, but she is having none of it.\n\nWhen are people going to understand that this makes things *worse*?  NTA, but you didn't handle it well.", "NTA. it's one thing to be uncomfortable with being cleaned up after-I personally wouldn't know how to treat a maid in my home aside from being polite, I just get a little anxious about not cleaning when others are, haha. but this is a different sort of resentment and I can't help but wonder if Amy is going to start saying maria is stealing or something.  \n\n\nAmy is frankly, unreasonable. try giving maria the month off and see how messy the place gets.", "Gotta go against the grain here, YTA.\n\nNot because you don't want to fire the maid, but because you aren't taking your partners feelings into account.\n\nSure, Maria may be like family to you. But to your partner, she's a stranger with a key to your shared living space who has already walked in on her while showering. It's reasonable for your partner to feel uncomfortable, but you don't seem to care about that.\n\nFrom your partner's perspective, you are choosing the maid over her comfort and security.", "Nta but you don't actually know that you can trust her m3 years isn't that long at all and there's a saying that you never truly know someone until you live with them. Girlfriend is exhibiting very controlling and territorial behavior. You have known Maria your entire life and you let this girl you've barely known call her a creep and a sneak. So hurtful. The woman is just doing her job. Have a calm and collected honest discussion with gf and get to the bottom of her issues. If she isn't willing to be evolved emotionally enough to admit she's being rude and irrational, and that her issues need to be put in check, than she shouldn't be kept around.", "NTA, but also if Amy is living with you then she deserves some say in boundaries. Can y'all decide on things that Maria leaves alone, or rooms that she doesn't clean?\n\nBut at this point y'all do kind of owe Maria for her many years of dedicated service to your family so it would definitely not be okay to fire her just because your girlfriend is being dramatic about the whole thing.", "She's jealous of a 57-year-old woman that is known you over half your life she's like a mother I think you should get rid of the girlfriend and not Maria NTA", "NTA\n\nDump the gf, keep Maria!", "NTA, why is Amy so happy to force someone to be fired? \nEspecially someone who's essentially been part of the family much longer than her?", "NTA.  Have a schedule made and ask Maria to keep it. I love having a housekeeper come once a week. I would never take a shower when she's expected.", "NTA. My family has a housekeeper that has become like family to us as well. She's as good as gold, diligent, and beautifully kind. If a significant other tried to get rid of her, I would ditch him.", "Your woman is the AH.  She needs to know this is what you want and she can take it or leave.  Also, it\u2019s no financial burden to the both of you so she\u2019s definitely benefitting from this arrangement.", "NTA dump your gf, she\u2019s toxic", "Ditch the girlfriend. Keep your Maria", "You've known Maria almost all your life and you've known Amy a few.\n\nMaria sounds like a lovely person,  Amy sounds like a petulant child.  \n\nI know who I'd ditch....and it's NOT Maria. \n\nNTA (unless you listen to Amy).", "NTA\n\nBy the way, in my experience, someone who is in love with you will not call you \"an egotistical and lazy asshole\". My guy, that's super fucking harsh of her. Also, giving you the \"cold shoulder\" ... very much a red flag too. People who care about you, and your shared relationship, will put in the effort to find peace and compromise. They also won't assume the worst of you. \n\nShe seems much too quick to interpret/frame people's behaviour in nasty, unkind ways. Calling your maid \"sneaky and creepy\", for example, in addition to how she sneeringly condemned you.", "From your English, it seems you are not in North America.  What culture are you from so that we might understand the dynamic of considering a Maria-type-person a desirable trapping, underfoot.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to do the chores yourself, actually.  You could have Maria or someone else, come by 2x a week for 2 hours to clean up.  Unless you live in a Palatial place which actually requires full time help.", "NAH. The thing about having a maid is that she's a stranger in your home, touching your stuff, seeing your routine etc. While some people are like OP, who are glad to have someone handle their house chores, others feel like their privacy is being invaded.\n\nPersonally, I had maids in my house before and I rather live in a more compact house, so there's less house chores and no need for a maid.", "Amy feels threatened. Don\u2019t ask me why. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIf Amy grew up less wealthy than you, then she should understand Maria needing the job she has. Maria has been with your family since you were a child, and she's quite useful to you being in a residency program. I can almost guarantee that if Maria was let go and you were too tired to do any housework, she'd still be complaining.", "Nta", "NTA - your gf is lying to you she said she was at work but she was home. She got caught thats why she doesnt want your maid so she can lie about her whereabouts.", "NTA\n\nYou need to tell your gf that she can move out if she doesn\u2019t like it, but Maria is staying.  Honestly, this behavior of hers is worrisome.  She is the type to give you an ultimatum.  It\u2019s all about what she wants and you will be unhappy if she is not catered to.  If she doesn\u2019t understand Maria is practically family and accidents happen, maybe you need to reconsider her as a gf, let alone a wife.  Because she will be worse after you marry if you allow her to get away with this kind of controlling behavior now.", "Exactly. GF is basically saying she wants OP to do chores. Maybe he\u2019d rather have Maria do his chores. If GF doesn\u2019t like Maria doing them, she can volunteer to do them all, but she shouldn\u2019t be saying OP must split them with her! OP is getting them done by paying Maria to do it, and he doesn\u2019t share finances with the GF. \n\nHOWEVER clearly GF feels like she doesn\u2019t have enough privacy with Maria around, so that needs to be worked out. Maybe Maria can leave her room alone or something.", ">If you were in my country, your parents would dislike your gf just for calling Maria creepy after she spent DECADES respecting their privacy and home, and that would apply even if she was the richest, poshest of them all.\n\n100% this.", "Saying that they are incompatible is a little over the top. This singular incident doesn\u2019t give you an overview of their relationship.", "This is where I sit. I'm the same way. Amy lives there now and whenever homes combine there has to be some compromise. I don't think he should fire the housekeeper but maybe adjust what she does to make Amy more comfortable, like I suggested in a different comment.", "I said basically the same thing as your comment and I'm getting downvoted for it. \n\nI do think though that the housekeeper had a little bit of responsibility here, if a shower was running she should have heard it, and I think if a bathroom door is closed she should knock. That's just a good habit to get into for anybody who's cleaning somebody else's house. I can understand why she would assume nobody's home but just to be on the safe side it's something that she should always do.", "She\u2019s not basically family, she\u2019s not basically an aunt, she\u2019s an employee. Their relationship is mostly transactional. Feeling of affection towards each other doesn\u2019t change that.", "Also, your gf\u2019s angry reaction is concerning. Angry about being walked in on while in the shower, sure. But to yell at Maria and still be so angry with her later about it is a red flag to me. Is this how she treats a lot of service industry people?", "This is what I wanna know. Unless Amy was already out of the shower and drying off.", "Exactly. People are too busy hating on the girlfriend to notice the inconsistency in Maria\u2019s defence.", "For real people are trashing the GF so much here. It's astounding.\n\nYes she overreacted but I was thinking, she's been uncomfortable with this from the start, it makes me wonder if she's feeling like OP isn't listening to her concerns and respecting her discomfort here. I of course don't think firing Maria is the answer. But neither is simply dumping the GF. They've been dating for years, this isn't a brand new relationship.", "Exactly, like does how does she not hear the water running when she enters the bathroom? You can\u2019t tell me that from the moment she entered the house to the moment she open the bathroom\u2019s door she had music blasting in her ears so loudly that she could not hear anything else. That is most definitely bullshit. Either OP is inventing this story from beginning to end or Maria is not telling the entire truth.", "People take days off work sometimes...", "I do wonder, did Amy know Maria was coming at that time with the biggest purpose being cleaning the bathroom? I just feel weird about how things went down. She was supposed to be at work, if she didn\u2019t know then fine maybe talk about what\u2019s going on, but if she did know the time she was coming to clean and the fact that the bathroom was her main goal that day maybe she did this on purpose to have an excuse to ask OP to fire her. \n\nOP you are NTA.", "In addition to what others have said, it would appear from the post that this is happening in a country outside of the US, which can change things significantly. In a lot of countries, labor can be extremely cheap (from e.g. rural population that comes to the city for work), so maids and such are accessible for people at much lower income brackets.", "Yeah I was gonna ask how we define middle class these days.", "Exactly what I was saying earlier \ud83d\udcaf", "Same, I'm working class and plan to remain so my entire life, but delegating some cleaning to a housekeeper is definitely on my list eventually!", "If someone unexpected walked in on me while I was naked in the shower, yeah, I would yell at them. It's called being startled.\n\nI understand judging the girlfriend for her general attitude, but it's absolute garbage nonsense to judge her for being upset enough to yell in the moment her privacy has been violated.", "you're giving a regular person way too much credit if you think she was scheming and plotting to get herself into that situation. jesus christ lol", "It feels like your gf set up a reason to be upset with Maria and be \"justified\" in demanding Maria be fired. Not cool", "That's quite the assumption there.", "I doubt anyone would have chosen to do more work instead of taking a week to relax. Especially considering cleaning takes a toll on the body and she is in her 50s. Besides, from what OP said, she did not volunteer her services but his parents did. It\u2019s not like she had any say in it.", "Can't argue with that logic", "Yes, the gf should move out. She sounds awful.\n\nNTA but I can't believe some of your friends are on gfs side. Nobody on reddit is. Seems odd.", "The issue is\u2026..Maria ISN\u2019T a stranger. She\u2019s been working for OP\u2019s family for 18 years. GF is the newcomer\u2026.and she\u2019s pitching a fit and making demands that this trusted housekeeper be fired? How cruel is that?", "Isn't that more a bit of guilt, that you \"could help\" because you were raised by your parents to do things together, and about \"being in the way of her work\"?\n\nWhen my mother started working again I was 8, and when I was 12 she returned to full time. Around that time a cleaning lady did her round every Thursday and I made sure to leave the house because I didn't want to be in the way while doing nothing", "Did you read the post? She was offended that the maid entered the home while she was in the shower and didn\u2019t hear the doorbell. How is that performing poorly or irreconcilable issues?", "It's a statement one might make while screaming in hysteria over an accident. Like the kind of hysteria you get when you're desperate to get rid of someone, you finally have an excuse, but the person that actually has the power to make it happen isn't cooperating.", "I would think it's common sense to knock on a closed bathroom door too. Just to be safe.", "Your doubt has no bearing on what her preference may or may not have been. She chose to take the job. Why do you want to remove her agency?", "No you are absolutely right. I was on the fence after reading this at first, because perhaps she was just really mad about the sudden walk in while showering. I had several incidents when living with roommates and I really thought one of them had a kink to 'catch' me in the shower because there was several incidents. \n\nBut this comment really struck the real issue, the real thing that OP needs to be seriously concerned about. The fact that she wants an innocent worker fired for having an attitude towards having a housemaid in the house doing a job that gets looked down on. She should have told OP that she would be home that day. She also should have expected Maria to be there sometime that day, and have an ear out or lock the door as a courtesy that the room was being used. She is having a terrible attitude about this, and is incredibly rude. OP's family has taken care of this person generously and will continue to do so with or without the son and who he associates with. \n\nHope OP continues to see how caring the parents are towards people with their money. They could use a damn service to anyone anytime, but chose someone and they got close with and kept them employed for a long time. OP, I hope you read these comments and reflect. Give the gf some time to maybe apologize and compromise. I would have a serious talk about this either way.\n\nEdit: Also, this behavior that was super over the top reaction could also root up from it being a racial profiling. Really hope she's not being racist.", "LOL, that's becos we've seen this story \"a thousand times\", and we know what the probabilities are when someone starts behaving like this.\n\nBut the OP has a relationship with her and a circle of friends (and they're all really young), so they are hoping that they can still \"work things out\".\n\nBut when you've had as much experience as many people on here have had (including myself), you absolutely HAVE TO BELIEVE WHO PEOPLE ARE WHEN THEY SHOW YOU THE FIRST TIME.", "Maria is a stranger to Amy though.", "You think a male housekeeper would solve the problem? Did you and everyone else skip over the part where she walked in on the girlfriend while she was in the shower (presumably naked)? That's the point at which she yelled at the maid. That's...actually pretty reasonable, even if the general attitude is not. A man walking in on the girlfriend is not going to make her more comfortable lmfao", "Or how she treats people close to him? The maid has been around since he was 7. Sounds like a pile of insecurities", "She probably knew Maria was coming, she just didn\u2019t know she would literally come into the bathroom. Why are you confused?", "My saying \u00ab\u00a0I doubt\u00a0\u00bb is mostly a figure of speech ffs. Besides, you\u2019re the only one making baseless assumptions talking about \u00ab\u00a0Maybe Maria doesn't want to get paid for doing nothing\u00a0\u00bb as if you know her personally lmao.
