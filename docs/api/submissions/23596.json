I love her and everything was going well until this argument.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI am very lucky to be born in a rich family, so my parents used to have a maid to do the housework, Maria (57F). She has been working for my parents since I'm 7 and became a family friend. For example we were all invited to the wedding of her daughther. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nLast year, my parents took a well deserved retirement and enjoy some trips, visit family etc, so since last year, they have spent very little time at home, so Maria didn't have much work to do in their home. My parents proposed to have Maria as a maid for my apartment. I gladly approved because I love Maria, and usually I am very tired after work, so it is nice to have someone to take care of the home. Maria was also happy to keep working for us. My parents insisted to cover the whole wage of Maria until the end of my residency, even if I could do it (she earns about 2.5 times minimal salary in my country)\n\n\r  \n\r  \nAmy comes from a more modest background and doesn't understand the principle of having a maid. She doesn't want Maria to iron her clothes, or tidying her stuff. I thought she wasn't used too but Amy seems to dislike Maria for some reason. Here is the conflict\u00a0: yesterday, Maria came to work and especially clean the bathroom, Amy was supposed to be at work, but she was showering and didn't put the lock, you know the rest. Amy got angry at Maria and yelled at her. Maria called me to explain me the incident, she told me she apologized and tried to say she thought Amy was at work  that she rang the bell before entering with her key.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nWhen I came home, Amy was still angry, she says Maria is sneaky and creepy and that I should fire and we should just split chores. I try to calm her down and told that maybe she was overreacting, but she is having none of it. Honestly, I don't want to ditch Maria, I have total trust in her, she is almost family to me, also, I know I sound a bit lazy but, both Amy and I have pretty demanding jobs so dealing with chores after work would be tiring. Furthermore, it would without doubt upset my parents. I tried to explain all of this to Amy but she called me an egoistical and lazy AH, she said that I choose Maria instead of her and her comfort. She is now giving me the cold shoulder.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI feel bad about this, I talked about it with my friends. Some sides with me but a few also say that I am in the wrong, I'm a bit torn.\r  \n\r  \nSo AITA  ?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1690842280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15eu2y2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_fire_my_maid_to_please_my/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to confront the GF and ask her what her actual issue is because Maria hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Then go from there. I would guess your GF is going to deflect back to Maria and if she won\u2019t actually talk about what\u2019s bothering her decide where to go from there. The rest of your relationship will be like this, are you prepared to deal with it? Maria\u2019s done nothing wrong though.", "NTA.  Amy shows no compassion to people who you deem as trustworthy and have been with you for a while.  You are getting the preview of what she\u2019s like when she doesn\u2019t get her way.  The way she yelled at Maria shows how she treats people.  You\u2019re not the asshole.  She is. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Wow, I\u2019m amazed that you even need to ask this. You are definitely NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds like an entitled monster without any regard for the livelihood and emotions of other. \n\nI\u2019d keep the maid and get rid of your girlfriend", "NTA.  Congrats for being able to afford housekeeping.  \n\nHousekeeping, chefs, landscapers\u2026.  those are better life enhancements than expensive toys nobody else can play with.  Hopefully someday, we all taste the joys of extra time.", "I\u2019m going with NAH though Amy\u2019s response of Maria being creepy and you being lazy was uncalled for. I think Amy is uncomfortable. You\u2019ve had Maria in your life since you were a child. Amy\u2019s had her in her life for like 20 days.  This has to be strange for her. Maybe set up some boundaries (job duties) together. What tasks you want Maria to do and which you don\u2019t. You are both benefitting from this. To let her go and split the chores is going to leave neither of you any time to relax or spend time together. Include a set schedule for Maria so Amy isn\u2019t surprised when she shows up.", "NTA\n\n\"she says Maria is sneaky and creepy and that I should fire and we should just split chores.\"\n\nI could be off here, but it seems she has trust issues more than you being \"lazy.\" That seems a little weird to me given the context of Maria that you gave, as she is not just a random maid. There is nothing wrong with hiring a maid, and especially in the context you provided.", "NTA, but I can tell you I would NOT want a maid under any circumstances.  It would be uncomfortable at best and I imagine your gf is hating having her around.\n\nAs an aside, everyone's jobs are exhausting and chores suck.  It's life.  And that's likely why your gf doesn't see this as a good reason to keep a maid.", "NTA\n\nYou are in a residency program and are understandably tired. Your family wants to help you and  help Maria, something they can afford to do. \n\nI honestly don't see the problem.\n\nIf the problem is that you are wealthier than Amy then that problem is not going to go away, and and I'm pretty sure that you want to continue living what is probably an American upper middle class lifestyle. \n\nAmy is going to have to adjust or I don't see how this can work out.", "NTA. Although I do understand her not wanting her\nstuff to be touched, personally I don\u2019t like anyone touching my clothes/items apart from my partner. The bathroom thing a genuine misunderstanding I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for her to say Maria is a creep.", "Wow. Amy is sure taking this having a maid thing badly. I personally would love one. With my problems taking care of myself is a challenge. \n\nI was thinking about it as I read. Amy may have no idea what Maria is supposed to do. She needs to understand that this is Maria\u2019s job, and she is a professional. Have you asked Amy why she wants to see Maria unemployed?  Sounds like you can only keep one of them. The choice seems pretty straightforward.", "NTA.", "NAH however for the sake of your relationship you need to communicate some boundaries with Maria.  Maria has NOT been a part of your girlfriend's family for years.  She is a complete stranger to your GF, and you are expecting GF to be okay with a complete stranger rifling through her clothes and trash and etc.  I realize to you it's not \"rifling through\" but it is to your GF.  Tell Maria to leave your GF's clothes and space alone for now, and make sure Maria is there during a set schedule so that your GF knows when to expect her.  A stranger barging in on you in the shower is mortifying and definitely can feel very creepy.  Boundaries would resolve this issue very easily.  Maria is there to work - treat her like it and don't expect your GF to act like she is family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am a little surprised at going with NTA after the title but it seems to fit!", "I can see both sides. In Amy\u2019s mind, Maria is a like family figure, even though she\u2019s hired. That could be understandably difficult for her, as you\u2019re both young, and she\u2019s likely trying to strike out on her own, and differentiate herself from family, be independent. Maids do see everything. A good one says nothing, but she IS on your parent\u2019s pay. Also, since she\u2019s from a modest background, she likely wants to see that you can take care of yourself. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you can take care of yourself on your own- ordinarily that would be a problem but it also sounds like you are wealthy enough to not have to, so, I can understand that you love Maria. Heck, I would love to have a maid, I used to be one, it\u2019s a blessing if you can afford it. And she\u2019s close to you from childhood. Given both sides of the situation, I would choose Maria over the girlfriend, if it comes down to a choice. \n\nYour girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong though. But you should probably dump her and find one who is good with Maria. If I were you. What a sick world we live in. I hate this question. NTA.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve never hired housecleaning services it can feel strange to have non family members in your home. You and your GF can talk through that. A lot of middle class Americans who hire cleaners just have them clean but do tidying themselves so it can feel invasive when someone else handles clothes. But there is nothing wrong with hiring people for domestic work as long as the pay is fair. Plus you are doing a residency. That\u2019s exhausting and stressful.", "NTA.  You've had a lifetime with Maria, your GF is insecure, class conscious and jealous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep Maria, and tell your GF she is not allowed to yell at or abuse your family's companion.  If she continues - let the GF go, not worth your time.  She's literally jealous of Maria and that is not ok or acceptable.", "NTA: You and your girlfriend are incompatible. Sounds like too much of a social class difference to be honest. A lot of people from lower/middle income backgrounds are vehemently opposed to having a maid/housekeeper and look down on it. It sounds like your GF is like this.", "A maid so trusted that they\u2019re almost like a family member is super rare. Girlfriends like Amy who like to pass judgment on lifestyles she doesn\u2019t nor tries to understand are a dime a dozen. Looks like Amy is about to be an ex girlfriend. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI think Amy isn\u2019t comfortable with having a maid since it\u2019s not something she is used too but she knew that Maria was there prior to her moving into your apartment. She cannot give ultimatums because it is YOUR space still. You can make it known to Maria to not touch Amy\u2019s things so that she can do her own chores. Maria is like family to you & obviously her family treats you the same since you were invited to her daughters wedding. What is Maria going to do if she\u2019s fired especially since she\u2019s been with your family for so long?", "NAH\n\nThere is having boundaries and then there\u2019s telling you to fire someone who has been with your family for 20 years who is basically and aunt by how you\u2019ve described your relationship with her and her family. Also basically saying cutting off her income that, if I read your post right, is 2.5x higher than a lot of people would be getting. If that\u2019s a fair wage, no idea, but Maria seems happy with it.  \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want her stuff touched, I wouldn\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine. Just show Maria what\u2019s hers and that Amy would prefer to clean the things that are hers. If she wouldn\u2019t want her in your shared bedroom, I feel that\u2019s another boundary that is reasonable. Just put things like laundry in a basket outside the door.\n\nEdit: forgot NAH was an option. Changed it.", "You are NTA, especially if you show the girlfriend the door and keep the maid. Do make a point of tidying up after yourself so her cleaning work is easier.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nInfo: is the shower room (bathroom?) soundproof? Is this how Maria entered a room with a closed (not locked) door while Amy was showering?", "NTA.  Sneaky and creepy? That sounds a little over-the-top. Any chance Maria is a different race than you two?", "NAH.  I\u2019m sure your gf is more mad/embarrassed about the maid entering the bathroom at the wrong time than anything else.  And it sounds like a temporary situation until your parents get back, so this may resolve itself.\n\nBut if push comes to shove and your gf makes an ultimatum, pick the more useful of the two\u2026", "NTA. You can\u2019t fire anybody for just doing their job. Especially almost family. If your gf can\u2019t and won\u2019t show compassion then perhaps it\u2019s the gf who should be fired.", "NTA. I'm from a Latin American country where both the highest and lowest classes would agree nothing is tackier than to get rid of the trusted stuff that has seen the family's children grow. \n\nYour parents found a way to lighten Maria's load now that she is older. She went from cleaning a big house to cleaning an apartment with only two people. She is doing everything she can to do it while your gf is out in order not to be a bother; your gf should be more understanding of a 57 year old woman who still wants to earn her bread by doing honest work. \n\nIf you were in my country, your parents would dislike your gf just for calling Maria creepy after she spent DECADES respecting their privacy and home, and that would apply even if she was the richest, poshest of them all.", "NTA. Your gf is strange. I'd be thrilled to have a housekeeper that my rich bfs parents paid for!", "NTA your girlfriend should be grateful she even has a maid lol", "NTA- my heart breaks for Maria who was just trying to do her job. \n\nYour gf\u2019s inferiority complex about your family being able to afford a maid isn\u2019t your problem and she should not be taking it out on Maria.", "NTA. Your arrangement with Maria is a long-standing one and Amy needs to accept it or she can move out. It\u2019s OK if your girlfriend wants to take care of her own personal stuff but she gets no say about the rest of the house.", "NTA she knew Maria was there when she agreed to move in. What is the split for expenses?", "NTA. From what you wrote, Maria doesn't sound creepy and she has been part of your life forever. I've had a maid, and I know how hard it is to find someone you trust. Additionally, that would create problems for you AND for your parents. Amy is thinking about herself. Which would be OK as long as she didn't try to direct your behaviour. For example, she could say \"I'd rather wash and iron my clothes myself\". But the moment she pushes for you to do house chores you don't want to do, you have a reasonable reason for not doing (demanding job), AND you have the money to be able to afford a maid for, I see red flags shining bright.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a gf problem. You need to fix that.", "NTA \nI understand your gf maybe not being used to have a maid and finding it weird, BUT you have a responsibility towards your employee of nearly 20 years and even though you maybe legally could fire her, you shouldn\u2019t! As she is part of your family as you have stated yourself.\nYou need to have a talk with gf that you respect certain parts of her wishes aka Maria not touching her things, but that the relationship with Maria is way longer, keeping her employed is your responsibility, plus you don\u2019t want to do chores. So gf needs to find it in herself to compromise.\n\nPS: I have a cleaning lady since more than 10 years. I love her dearly. She saves me from living in a mess. She is also getting older so I pay her more these days, bc she needs longer. And I am putting money aside monthly so at some point I can send her into \u201cearly retirement\u201d aka me paying her still for a while, while she is not working for me anymore.Be kind to the people who work for you and make your life easier!", "NAH \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, your girlfriend knew about Maria being your maid (housekeeper?) before she moved in. And I absolutely think it\u2019s good you don\u2019t want to leave Maria hanging.\n\nBut I also get her point of view, I personally wouldn\u2019t want a maid. I don\u2019t think maids are nosy, creepy people **at all**, but I would not want someone who isn\u2019t me or my partner to see my dirty underwear, and my trash etc.\n\nYou have to understand that while Maria is like a family member to you, she\u2019s basically a stranger to Amy.\n\nThe bathroom incident was unfortunate, but imo your girlfriend\u2019s fault - the schedule was clearly communicated. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to sit down and solve this issue. If Amy absolutely does not want to ever have a maid work for her, and if you absolutely always want to have a maid work for you, maybe you\u2019re not that compatible. But maybe you\u2019ll also be able to solve that issue!", "NTA. But I would sit down girlfriend and ask her wtf is this really about, Maria is just doing her job, if your girl doesn\u2019t likes it, she doesn\u2019t has to live there.", "NTA. How does Amy treat the wait staff at restaurants? She's giving you an ultimatum. That's not a healthy response in a relationship.", "NTA but Amy is", "NAH you can both have differences on opinion but I will say that if you hired Maria while your gf was already living with you, your heading into ah territory. You can\u2019t just unilaterally decide to have a whole person at your apartment for multiple hours a day. Was there even a discussion?", "NTA\n\nI'm under the assumption Maria entered the apartment with her key not the bathroom your gf was showering in. If it was the bathroom then you need to speak with Maria about boundaries.", "NTA at all. Maria depends on this job, especially at her age she would not be able to find anything comparable, and Amy sounds high maintenance. But please be careful because Amy sounds like she will try to run Maria off, and that is not a relationship you should lose. Amy knew the situation when she moved in so she can get on board or leave. Compassion and perspective are must have qualities in a relationship.", "Tell us more about your personal feelings about maids, it\u2019s very relevant.", "But why do boundaries need to be communicated if Amy was supposed to be at work and Maria rang the bell BEFORE entering the house? I feel like OP is already doing everything he can to make the situation more comfortable for Amy, but she flipped over an innocent mistake. Would I have walked into the bathroom if I heard the shower running? Hell no! I would\u2019ve knocked but what if the shower was already turned off and there was no obvious noise coming from the bathroom? I would\u2019ve walked in to do my job and clean. Amy seems insecure for some reason that I can\u2019t put my finger on \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No, Amy needs to get over herself or move on! She doesn't get to mobe in an dictate how things go.... this is still his apartment not Amy's!", "There is already a schedule, so we know when Maria is coming and what she will do, and who is at home. Amy was supposed to be at work, but she told me she took the day off because she was tired. That's why Maria didn't expect to see Amy", ">Your girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong though\n\nThe girlfriend is being rude and unpleasant to this innocent woman for who has done nothing wrong. Of course she is wrong.", "I'm poor and would love to afford a housekeeper! Lol", "I will guess that she was about to shower or just finish showering, so there were no noise.", "No, we are all white", "The thought crossed my mind as well. I\u2019m wondering if racial stereotypes could be a mitigating factor.", "No it's been a year since Maria works at my apartment, Amy moved in 2 months ago and she already knew about Maria", "It could be.  It may be where GF is coming from but failing to communicate. \n\nStarting off living with a partner and a stranger regularly comes into your private space-  I know not everyone is gonna have an issue with that, but some people would, and GF might be one of them.", "They are just providing context for why someone might not like a maid. I would hate to never be alone in my home.", "Wait so she knew she was coming, specifically to clean the bathroom and still took a shower while conveniently leaving the bathroom door unlocked? Question does Maria listen to music while working? If not she should have heard the shower running, if she didn\u2019t hear it then was Amy already out the shower and drying off? This seems way too much of a coincidence to me and seems a bit like Amy might have set Maria up.", "I would have guessed that also, but OP specifically states, \u201cbut she was showering\u201d so I questioned it.\n\nIt\u2019s been 35+ years since I\u2019ve lived in apartments, but I recall being able to hear the shower water running from any point within the apartment. I\u2019m in a 4-bedroom house now, and I can hear the shower water in the rear bath running, from the front door. \n\nNo matter. OP is still NTA.", "Well, at least it's not that. Still, it's an odd statement without any evidence.", "Damn same, immediately thought it was a race thing based on the girlfriend\u2019s accusations.", "So your girlfriend knows about Maria and knows her schedule. You\u2019re NTA, but your girlfriend, unfortunately, is.", "They come, do their job then they leave. Just how do you think this works?"]}
