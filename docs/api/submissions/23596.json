I love her and everything was going well until this argument.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI am very lucky to be born in a rich family, so my parents used to have a maid to do the housework, Maria (57F). She has been working for my parents since I'm 7 and became a family friend. For example we were all invited to the wedding of her daughther. \n\n\r  \n\r  \nLast year, my parents took a well deserved retirement and enjoy some trips, visit family etc, so since last year, they have spent very little time at home, so Maria didn't have much work to do in their home. My parents proposed to have Maria as a maid for my apartment. I gladly approved because I love Maria, and usually I am very tired after work, so it is nice to have someone to take care of the home. Maria was also happy to keep working for us. My parents insisted to cover the whole wage of Maria until the end of my residency, even if I could do it (she earns about 2.5 times minimal salary in my country)\n\n\r  \n\r  \nAmy comes from a more modest background and doesn't understand the principle of having a maid. She doesn't want Maria to iron her clothes, or tidying her stuff. I thought she wasn't used too but Amy seems to dislike Maria for some reason. Here is the conflict\u00a0: yesterday, Maria came to work and especially clean the bathroom, Amy was supposed to be at work, but she was showering and didn't put the lock, you know the rest. Amy got angry at Maria and yelled at her. Maria called me to explain me the incident, she told me she apologized and tried to say she thought Amy was at work  that she rang the bell before entering with her key.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nWhen I came home, Amy was still angry, she says Maria is sneaky and creepy and that I should fire and we should just split chores. I try to calm her down and told that maybe she was overreacting, but she is having none of it. Honestly, I don't want to ditch Maria, I have total trust in her, she is almost family to me, also, I know I sound a bit lazy but, both Amy and I have pretty demanding jobs so dealing with chores after work would be tiring. Furthermore, it would without doubt upset my parents. I tried to explain all of this to Amy but she called me an egoistical and lazy AH, she said that I choose Maria instead of her and her comfort. She is now giving me the cold shoulder.\n\n\r  \n\r  \nI feel bad about this, I talked about it with my friends. Some sides with me but a few also say that I am in the wrong, I'm a bit torn.\r  \n\r  \nSo AITA  ?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1690842280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15eu2y2/aita_for_not_wanting_to_fire_my_maid_to_please_my/", "score": 291, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You need to confront the GF and ask her what her actual issue is because Maria hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Then go from there. I would guess your GF is going to deflect back to Maria and if she won\u2019t actually talk about what\u2019s bothering her decide where to go from there. The rest of your relationship will be like this, are you prepared to deal with it? Maria\u2019s done nothing wrong though.", "NTA.  Amy shows no compassion to people who you deem as trustworthy and have been with you for a while.  You are getting the preview of what she\u2019s like when she doesn\u2019t get her way.  The way she yelled at Maria shows how she treats people.  You\u2019re not the asshole.  She is. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "Wow, I\u2019m amazed that you even need to ask this. You are definitely NTA.\n\nYour girlfriend sounds like an entitled monster without any regard for the livelihood and emotions of other. \n\nI\u2019d keep the maid and get rid of your girlfriend", "NTA.  Congrats for being able to afford housekeeping.  \n\nHousekeeping, chefs, landscapers\u2026.  those are better life enhancements than expensive toys nobody else can play with.  Hopefully someday, we all taste the joys of extra time.", "I\u2019m going with NAH though Amy\u2019s response of Maria being creepy and you being lazy was uncalled for. I think Amy is uncomfortable. You\u2019ve had Maria in your life since you were a child. Amy\u2019s had her in her life for like 20 days.  This has to be strange for her. Maybe set up some boundaries (job duties) together. What tasks you want Maria to do and which you don\u2019t. You are both benefitting from this. To let her go and split the chores is going to leave neither of you any time to relax or spend time together. Include a set schedule for Maria so Amy isn\u2019t surprised when she shows up.", "NTA\n\n\"she says Maria is sneaky and creepy and that I should fire and we should just split chores.\"\n\nI could be off here, but it seems she has trust issues more than you being \"lazy.\" That seems a little weird to me given the context of Maria that you gave, as she is not just a random maid. There is nothing wrong with hiring a maid, and especially in the context you provided.", "NTA, but I can tell you I would NOT want a maid under any circumstances.  It would be uncomfortable at best and I imagine your gf is hating having her around.\n\nAs an aside, everyone's jobs are exhausting and chores suck.  It's life.  And that's likely why your gf doesn't see this as a good reason to keep a maid.", "NTA\n\nYou are in a residency program and are understandably tired. Your family wants to help you and  help Maria, something they can afford to do. \n\nI honestly don't see the problem.\n\nIf the problem is that you are wealthier than Amy then that problem is not going to go away, and and I'm pretty sure that you want to continue living what is probably an American upper middle class lifestyle. \n\nAmy is going to have to adjust or I don't see how this can work out.", "NTA. Although I do understand her not wanting her\nstuff to be touched, personally I don\u2019t like anyone touching my clothes/items apart from my partner. The bathroom thing a genuine misunderstanding I definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for her to say Maria is a creep.", "Wow. Amy is sure taking this having a maid thing badly. I personally would love one. With my problems taking care of myself is a challenge. \n\nI was thinking about it as I read. Amy may have no idea what Maria is supposed to do. She needs to understand that this is Maria\u2019s job, and she is a professional. Have you asked Amy why she wants to see Maria unemployed?  Sounds like you can only keep one of them. The choice seems pretty straightforward.", "NTA.", "NAH however for the sake of your relationship you need to communicate some boundaries with Maria.  Maria has NOT been a part of your girlfriend's family for years.  She is a complete stranger to your GF, and you are expecting GF to be okay with a complete stranger rifling through her clothes and trash and etc.  I realize to you it's not \"rifling through\" but it is to your GF.  Tell Maria to leave your GF's clothes and space alone for now, and make sure Maria is there during a set schedule so that your GF knows when to expect her.  A stranger barging in on you in the shower is mortifying and definitely can feel very creepy.  Boundaries would resolve this issue very easily.  Maria is there to work - treat her like it and don't expect your GF to act like she is family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I am a little surprised at going with NTA after the title but it seems to fit!", "I can see both sides. In Amy\u2019s mind, Maria is a like family figure, even though she\u2019s hired. That could be understandably difficult for her, as you\u2019re both young, and she\u2019s likely trying to strike out on her own, and differentiate herself from family, be independent. Maids do see everything. A good one says nothing, but she IS on your parent\u2019s pay. Also, since she\u2019s from a modest background, she likely wants to see that you can take care of yourself. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like you can take care of yourself on your own- ordinarily that would be a problem but it also sounds like you are wealthy enough to not have to, so, I can understand that you love Maria. Heck, I would love to have a maid, I used to be one, it\u2019s a blessing if you can afford it. And she\u2019s close to you from childhood. Given both sides of the situation, I would choose Maria over the girlfriend, if it comes down to a choice. \n\nYour girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong though. But you should probably dump her and find one who is good with Maria. If I were you. What a sick world we live in. I hate this question. NTA.", "NTA. If you\u2019ve never hired housecleaning services it can feel strange to have non family members in your home. You and your GF can talk through that. A lot of middle class Americans who hire cleaners just have them clean but do tidying themselves so it can feel invasive when someone else handles clothes. But there is nothing wrong with hiring people for domestic work as long as the pay is fair. Plus you are doing a residency. That\u2019s exhausting and stressful.", "NTA.  You've had a lifetime with Maria, your GF is insecure, class conscious and jealous.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nKeep Maria, and tell your GF she is not allowed to yell at or abuse your family's companion.  If she continues - let the GF go, not worth your time.  She's literally jealous of Maria and that is not ok or acceptable.", "NTA: You and your girlfriend are incompatible. Sounds like too much of a social class difference to be honest. A lot of people from lower/middle income backgrounds are vehemently opposed to having a maid/housekeeper and look down on it. It sounds like your GF is like this.", "A maid so trusted that they\u2019re almost like a family member is super rare. Girlfriends like Amy who like to pass judgment on lifestyles she doesn\u2019t nor tries to understand are a dime a dozen. Looks like Amy is about to be an ex girlfriend. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nI think Amy isn\u2019t comfortable with having a maid since it\u2019s not something she is used too but she knew that Maria was there prior to her moving into your apartment. She cannot give ultimatums because it is YOUR space still. You can make it known to Maria to not touch Amy\u2019s things so that she can do her own chores. Maria is like family to you & obviously her family treats you the same since you were invited to her daughters wedding. What is Maria going to do if she\u2019s fired especially since she\u2019s been with your family for so long?", "NAH\n\nThere is having boundaries and then there\u2019s telling you to fire someone who has been with your family for 20 years who is basically and aunt by how you\u2019ve described your relationship with her and her family. Also basically saying cutting off her income that, if I read your post right, is 2.5x higher than a lot of people would be getting. If that\u2019s a fair wage, no idea, but Maria seems happy with it.  \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want her stuff touched, I wouldn\u2019t, then that\u2019s fine. Just show Maria what\u2019s hers and that Amy would prefer to clean the things that are hers. If she wouldn\u2019t want her in your shared bedroom, I feel that\u2019s another boundary that is reasonable. Just put things like laundry in a basket outside the door.\n\nEdit: forgot NAH was an option. Changed it.", "You are NTA, especially if you show the girlfriend the door and keep the maid. Do make a point of tidying up after yourself so her cleaning work is easier.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nInfo: is the shower room (bathroom?) soundproof? Is this how Maria entered a room with a closed (not locked) door while Amy was showering?", "NTA.  Sneaky and creepy? That sounds a little over-the-top. Any chance Maria is a different race than you two?", "NAH.  I\u2019m sure your gf is more mad/embarrassed about the maid entering the bathroom at the wrong time than anything else.  And it sounds like a temporary situation until your parents get back, so this may resolve itself.\n\nBut if push comes to shove and your gf makes an ultimatum, pick the more useful of the two\u2026", "NTA. You can\u2019t fire anybody for just doing their job. Especially almost family. If your gf can\u2019t and won\u2019t show compassion then perhaps it\u2019s the gf who should be fired.", "NTA. I'm from a Latin American country where both the highest and lowest classes would agree nothing is tackier than to get rid of the trusted staff that has seen the family's children grow. \n\nYour parents found a way to lighten Maria's load now that she is older. She went from cleaning a big house to cleaning an apartment with only two people. She is doing everything she can to do it while your gf is out in order not to be a bother; your gf should be more understanding of a 57 year old woman who still wants to earn her bread by doing honest work. \n\nIf you were in my country, your parents would dislike your gf just for calling Maria creepy after she spent DECADES respecting their privacy and home, and that would apply even if she was the richest, poshest of them all.", "NTA. Your gf is strange. I'd be thrilled to have a housekeeper that my rich bfs parents paid for!", "NTA your girlfriend should be grateful she even has a maid lol", "NTA- my heart breaks for Maria who was just trying to do her job. \n\nYour gf\u2019s inferiority complex about your family being able to afford a maid isn\u2019t your problem and she should not be taking it out on Maria.", "NTA. Your arrangement with Maria is a long-standing one and Amy needs to accept it or she can move out. It\u2019s OK if your girlfriend wants to take care of her own personal stuff but she gets no say about the rest of the house.", "NTA she knew Maria was there when she agreed to move in. What is the split for expenses?", "NTA. From what you wrote, Maria doesn't sound creepy and she has been part of your life forever. I've had a maid, and I know how hard it is to find someone you trust. Additionally, that would create problems for you AND for your parents. Amy is thinking about herself. Which would be OK as long as she didn't try to direct your behaviour. For example, she could say \"I'd rather wash and iron my clothes myself\". But the moment she pushes for you to do house chores you don't want to do, you have a reasonable reason for not doing (demanding job), AND you have the money to be able to afford a maid for, I see red flags shining bright.", "NTA.\n\nYou have a gf problem. You need to fix that.", "NTA \nI understand your gf maybe not being used to have a maid and finding it weird, BUT you have a responsibility towards your employee of nearly 20 years and even though you maybe legally could fire her, you shouldn\u2019t! As she is part of your family as you have stated yourself.\nYou need to have a talk with gf that you respect certain parts of her wishes aka Maria not touching her things, but that the relationship with Maria is way longer, keeping her employed is your responsibility, plus you don\u2019t want to do chores. So gf needs to find it in herself to compromise.\n\nPS: I have a cleaning lady since more than 10 years. I love her dearly. She saves me from living in a mess. She is also getting older so I pay her more these days, bc she needs longer. And I am putting money aside monthly so at some point I can send her into \u201cearly retirement\u201d aka me paying her still for a while, while she is not working for me anymore.Be kind to the people who work for you and make your life easier!", "NAH \n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong, your girlfriend knew about Maria being your maid (housekeeper?) before she moved in. And I absolutely think it\u2019s good you don\u2019t want to leave Maria hanging.\n\nBut I also get her point of view, I personally wouldn\u2019t want a maid. I don\u2019t think maids are nosy, creepy people **at all**, but I would not want someone who isn\u2019t me or my partner to see my dirty underwear, and my trash etc.\n\nYou have to understand that while Maria is like a family member to you, she\u2019s basically a stranger to Amy.\n\nThe bathroom incident was unfortunate, but imo your girlfriend\u2019s fault - the schedule was clearly communicated. \n\nYou\u2019ll need to sit down and solve this issue. If Amy absolutely does not want to ever have a maid work for her, and if you absolutely always want to have a maid work for you, maybe you\u2019re not that compatible. But maybe you\u2019ll also be able to solve that issue!", "NTA. But I would sit down girlfriend and ask her wtf is this really about, Maria is just doing her job, if your girl doesn\u2019t likes it, she doesn\u2019t has to live there.", "NTA. How does Amy treat the wait staff at restaurants? She's giving you an ultimatum. That's not a healthy response in a relationship.", "NTA but Amy is", "NAH you can both have differences on opinion but I will say that if you hired Maria while your gf was already living with you, your heading into ah territory. You can\u2019t just unilaterally decide to have a whole person at your apartment for multiple hours a day. Was there even a discussion?", "NTA\n\nI'm under the assumption Maria entered the apartment with her key not the bathroom your gf was showering in. If it was the bathroom then you need to speak with Maria about boundaries.", "NTA at all. Maria depends on this job, especially at her age she would not be able to find anything comparable, and Amy sounds high maintenance. But please be careful because Amy sounds like she will try to run Maria off, and that is not a relationship you should lose. Amy knew the situation when she moved in so she can get on board or leave. Compassion and perspective are must have qualities in a relationship.", "Tell us more about your personal feelings about maids, it\u2019s very relevant.", "But why do boundaries need to be communicated if Amy was supposed to be at work and Maria rang the bell BEFORE entering the house? I feel like OP is already doing everything he can to make the situation more comfortable for Amy, but she flipped over an innocent mistake. Would I have walked into the bathroom if I heard the shower running? Hell no! I would\u2019ve knocked but what if the shower was already turned off and there was no obvious noise coming from the bathroom? I would\u2019ve walked in to do my job and clean. Amy seems insecure for some reason that I can\u2019t put my finger on \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "No, Amy needs to get over herself or move on! She doesn't get to mobe in an dictate how things go.... this is still his apartment not Amy's!", "There is already a schedule, so we know when Maria is coming and what she will do, and who is at home. Amy was supposed to be at work, but she told me she took the day off because she was tired. That's why Maria didn't expect to see Amy", ">Your girlfriend isn\u2019t wrong though\n\nThe girlfriend is being rude and unpleasant to this innocent woman for who has done nothing wrong. Of course she is wrong.", "I'm poor and would love to afford a housekeeper! Lol", "I will guess that she was about to shower or just finish showering, so there were no noise.", "No, we are all white", "The thought crossed my mind as well. I\u2019m wondering if racial stereotypes could be a factor.", "No it's been a year since Maria works at my apartment, Amy moved in 2 months ago and she already knew about Maria", "It could be.  It may be where GF is coming from but failing to communicate. \n\nStarting off living with a partner and a stranger regularly comes into your private space-  I know not everyone is gonna have an issue with that, but some people would, and GF might be one of them.", "They are just providing context for why someone might not like a maid. I would hate to never be alone in my home.", "Wait so she knew she was coming, specifically to clean the bathroom and still took a shower while conveniently leaving the bathroom door unlocked? Question does Maria listen to music while working? If not she should have heard the shower running, if she didn\u2019t hear it then was Amy already out the shower and drying off? This seems way too much of a coincidence to me and seems a bit like Amy might have set Maria up.", "I would have guessed that also, but OP specifically states, \u201cbut she was showering\u201d so I questioned it.\n\nIt\u2019s been 35+ years since I\u2019ve lived in apartments, but I recall being able to hear the shower water running from any point within the apartment. I\u2019m in a 4-bedroom house now, and I can hear the shower water in the rear bath running, from the front door. \n\nNo matter. OP is still NTA.", "Well, at least it's not that. Still, it's an odd statement without any evidence.", "Damn same, immediately thought it was a race thing based on the girlfriend\u2019s accusations.", "So your girlfriend knows about Maria and knows her schedule. You\u2019re NTA, but your girlfriend, unfortunately, is.", "They come, do their job then they leave. Just how do you think this works?", "NTA. Amy can look down on the maid all she wants but she\u2019s earning an honest living doing hard work and she earns that pay. She depends on you for job security. If you were to fire her after all her years of working for your family you would be a massive AH. Amy can get her own place and do her own chores", "I like Maria but not Amy.", "NTA\n\nAmy sucks.", "Nta. My mil is a maid has been for 40+ years. She came over from Mexico in the 80s and has been here ever since. She is the most hardworking woman I've met. She took me in when I was dating her son, who is now my husband. I'd go work with her cleaning houses. She'd work 5 days a week with at least 10 clients a week. She worked in the affluent neighborhoods, so the houses were big. The work is hard and tedious. She's like family to each of her clients. Some of her clients have moved across town, and she still cleans for them. A good maid is hard to come by, especially one like Maria. I'd keep the maid and fire your gf.", "She\u2019s been working since you\u2019re 7, and now you\u2019re 25. If it\u2019s me, she\u2019s already a family. In my country, I would even call her my aunt. Of course she\u2019s doing houseworks and chores, but she\u2019s doing it with respect from both side of her and your family, and love too.\n\nI\u2019m definitely not gonna tell you to break up with your gf immediately. But you guys definitely need a serious talk. In life mistakes always happen. Knowing when to apologize and when to forgive will always be very important. If she cannot forgive for even such a simple mistake, what else gonna happened next? Is she also gonna tell you to ditch your friends for such a simple mistake? Or your family next?\n\nWanting to do houseworks yourself are definitely not a reason to fire Maria. If anything, you can have her teach you to do them more efficiently, and she can also catch your slacks when you\u2019re really really busy.\n\nNTA", "NTA  It sounds like Amy is having a hard time adjusting to your lifestyle and feels like an outsider. It's not that she doesn't like Maria but that Maria is a constant reminder of how different you two are. You need to sit her down to find out if she can fully accept you as you are because you won't be changing.", "NTA. It is not okay to accuse a lady who has worked for your family all your life sneaky and creepy cause she comes in to do the job she gets paid for. That would absolutely make me question your girlfriend's integrity. It's one thing to not be used to having a housekeeper, it's an entirely different thing to vindictively try to get rid of a person who has been honest and reliable for two decades.", "NTA. Maria is part of the family and your girlfriend doesn't like that. I think it might be time to find another girlfriend.", "NTA. You have known Maria since you were a child. You trust her like family. And your family is her employer. What a shame that Amy is being so childish.", "NTA: You trust Maria and it seems like this is at the point the line between employee and family is blurred. Normally I support equal division of housework but if she drives Maria away, do not agree to do half the chores. (If Maria retires, that\u2019s a different story)", "NTA - I hope someday I date someone rich enough to have a maid. A part of me honestly can't believe your gf WANTS to do chores on top of having a full time job. \n\nSomeone else doing chores? For free? Heck, she could have walked in on the shower on PURPOSE and I wouldn't have complained.", "Choose Maria. NTA", "NTA. Can I borrow Maria lol. It's hard to get someone you can trust like family. Your gf is a walking \ud83d\udea9", "NTA. It's truly special to have a long term maid who is good at her job, and so close to you and your family. You have known her much longer than the GF. Seems like you should trust Maria more than  the GF. If Amy doesn't like it, she can leave. Tell her this is the schedule when Maria will be here. Tell Amy this would be very disappointing to your parents if they learned she wanted to stop maria from helping you. (Because from the relationship you describe, I think they would not be happy with Amy)", "Nta. Now that she is moved in she is starting to make demands.   If you give into this one what will her next one be? \n\nMaria is family and your gf treats her horribly", "NTA I grew up in a house with a housekeeper, and my family had always hired help for elderly folks or anyone who's just had surgery and needs help, etc. I find a lot of Americans view this as a weakness or a hit to their pride somehow. I really can't offer advice on how to change anyone's mind, but I can confirm it's a thing. It's ok to get help!! If I had to choose between therapy and a housekeeper I'd 100% choose the latter.", "NTA but a simple solution would be to ask Amy to list some SPECIFIC ways Maria is bothering her and ask Maria to avoid doing those things. Nothing unreasonable just like, if Amy wants to fold her own clothes, Maria leaves them, knocking on doors before entering, etc.\n\nI would emphasize to Amy that Maria has worked for your family for nearly 20 years and that it isn\u2019t fair to take away her job. It does NOT look good for long term housekeepers to be dismissed at her age and she will likely never have the same opportunity. Her whole life would be uprooted and like\u2026 she hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. Two months of getting used to a maid vs 20 years of work down the drain. One of those is definitely easier.", "NTA, you and your family are giving Maria a living. Sometimes older people actually want to work( not me, can\u2019t wait to retire) but some want somewhere to go and some need money. You and your GF are not on the same page with this issue and you need to have an honest conversation with letting her know that Maria is not leaving. Be careful because she may set Maria up for theft. Not saying she will but she seems to really dislike Maria.", "NTA.", "NTA", "You nta", "NTA but honestly I see where she\u2019s coming from. If I was in my own home (somewhere that is relatively new to me especially) and I was walked in on while being in the bathroom I wouldn\u2019t be too comfortable either", "NTA. I do think it would be a challenge to get used to having a house cleaner around, since I\u2019ve never been able to afford that sort of thing. But if I could afford to pay someone well, I would hire a house cleaner in a heartbeat because I hate cleaning house. \n\nThe only thing that\u2019s a little weird about this story is Maria not hearing that the shower was on and going into the bathroom anyways. Is that how that played out?", "NTA she can do her half of the chores and Maria can do yours.", "NTA, I came from a poor family and was in my ego about hiring help, feeling like I was \"better\" than that. \n\nThen I did it once because I was really in dire straights on time before an event I was hosting due to work shit, and now we have a lady who cleans our bathrooms and sweeps and mops our floors for us every couple weeks so we don't have to. \n\nI'd bet your girlfriend is in the same headspace I was and refuses to acknowledge how much easier be wealthy enough to have help is.", "When I first read the title, I thought it was the beginning of a Lifetime Movie of the Week where the maid or nanny is some sweet young thing that is trying to move in on girlfriend's territory. Once I read your story, I decided you are NTA. If you give in to Amy's tantrums over someone who has been a significant person in your life all these years, then she will very likely start throwing tantrums anytime she doesn't get her way.  You might want to take a minute to reflect on your relationship (with all the spare time you have as a resident \ud83d\ude42) and figure out if Amy has thrown mini-tantrums in the past. You may decide that you are fine with these dynamics if that is the case. Good luck to you all.", "NTA.  If your girlfriend is not comfortable now and is causing problems (Maria is trusted like family and is earning a very fair salary).  Your girlfriend would rather Maria be out of a job.  Your girlfriend's TA.", "NTA", "No AH here. \n\nAs someone who hates having others invade their privacy, I understand why the GF is unhappy with this.\n\nShe should not have been aggressive with the maid, but you guys have to talk it out. \n\nI personally would hate having a maid in the house, even if it is helpful.", "At this point, Maria is essentially a part of your family. Full stop.\n\nIt was a regrettable encounter but Amy is blowing it up way out of proportion. She is also showing an alarming lack of empathy for someone who was trying to do her job and apologized. \n\nNTA.", "YTA for being rich", "NAH\n\nAs someone who has done my own laundry since college, I would feel that my privacy was a bit violated if someone else did it. I think the way to solve this is by working out some kind of specific schedule and establishing things that are off limits because Amy is uncomfortable. It may be that Maria can't have a key, or that you put in some kind of smart luck with a combo that only works whatever hours or has a \"do not disturb\" type function like a hotel. I feel weird if my family cleans up after me, let alone a stranger which is what they are to each other.", "NAH You're  girl is threatened by your maid because she's better at being a maid", "NTA.  \n\nBut you and Amy need to have a conversation.   She feels dismissed.  This type of treatment isn\u2019t something she is used to at all. It may be your background, but it is not hers.  She isn\u2019t going to consider - \u201chmm maybe I need to consider when Maria is coming.\u201d   It would be something you consider because you are used to it.  \n\nShe literally feels violated.  I am not at all saying Maria IS doing that - but it gives her that feeling for some REASON.  Maria is crossing a boundary with Amy.   I cannot bring to fathom why it bothers her - but there is a reason behind it.  The question is - is this something you can work past or not?  Are there tiny compromises that could happen?  Like leaving her clothes alone?  Just making suggestions here.  \n\nAlso - I don\u2019t think Maria is creepy at all. I think it was an honest mistake.  Most maids have keys to the residences. Most knock and then enter if they don\u2019t get an answer.  It\u2019s how it works.  Amy isn\u2019t used to this - at all.  Empathize with that part JUST a little bit.  If I expected the house to be empty and I was in the shower - and someone was there suddenly - that would be a little shocking.  Haha. Again - Amy isn\u2019t used to this.  Like - at all.  But it doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s had - or you are.  Just talk about this. And I don\u2019t know if Maria has a schedule or something - but maybe that would help?   Good luck!\n\n3 years is a long time to give up over this issue. Sit down and talk with her.  3 year is a big time investment.", "YTA. Hear me out. Your home is both yours AND your gfs and seems to me any decision to involve another person in that household in any capacity should be unanimous. Not everyone likes having a housemaid all up in my business, for example me I detest it. The benefits do not outweight the positives for me and I think for your gf as well. It irks me to have my things touched and moved and my personal space intruded by a stranger. You say she's a professional and also a close friend of yours which is good for you but she's practically a stranger to her and does not have the same comfort level as you. Especially when she isn't used to having maids in the house lkike you have. Some people cannot detach. It's like there is a person in the room and I'm highly aware of it because this is my personal space where I'd like to relax and let my guard down, that kinda thing and then the shower incident happens. Well I for one completely understand why she'd be upset. Perhaps she could have controlled her freaking out better, but you never gave her a chance. You practically forced her into the home and she had no veto power about it. So I completely understand that she seized on the oppurtunity to make this a big deal and freak out. You can defend yourself how you want but you are kind of steam rolling her personal comfort in ther own home and this says something about how much you value your partner and is an oppurtunity to reconsider how you take her feelings and preferences into account, if you want to stay with her in the long run that is.", "INFO: Are you able to fire Maria? It seems that she in the employ of your parents and is being loaned to you.", "NTA", "Nta,something else is going o , cause this seems rather ridiculous imo, who doesn\u2019t want a maid, and? And who flips tf out over such a small misunderstanding? I was expecting Maria to be young and busty tbh", "NTA.  If I could afford help with household chores I\u2019d absolutely have a maid.  I\u2019d sit down with the gf and try and figure out if there is some deeper issue here she isn\u2019t telling you.  But if you trust Maria and have known her most of your life, it seems extreme to dismiss her when you need the help and can afford it.", "NTA. Ditch the gf someone who doesnt have compassion can turn into crazy. Also Maria is already a part of your family.", "NTA, but do you really want to be in a relationship with someone who treats others this way?", "Bold of Amy to call you egotistical when she's demanding you fire a near family friend for **doing her job** just because she doesn't like another woman having access to her boyfriends space. And yea, that's probably the reason for it. The shower was the straw that broke the camels back I guess, but I'd place money on this being more Amy being an insecure little girl who gets her hackles up over any woman in \"her mans life.\" Frankly I'd recommend giving Amy her walking papers for being unreasonable, insulting, and an asshole.\n\nNTA", "If you're providing employment to someone who's been a valued employee AND a family friend then I think your girlfriend and you need to sit down and talk.\n\nHaving a maid does not make you an AH.\n\nIf its your apartment - not your girlfriends - its not her call. And if you're doing a residency...man, take all the help you can get.", "NTA, and there is a missing element to what\u2019s happening here with Amy. It may not be something you know at the moment. Maria has been with your family for nearly 20 years. \n\nDoes Amy know your parents are paying Maria\u2019s salary? \nIs Amy intimidated by your family\u2019s connection to Maria?\nIs she bothered by the class differences from your family to hers?\nIs it a racist or classist thing from Amy towards Maria?\nDid Maria offend her or catch her doing something she shouldn\u2019t have been?\n\nIt comes off as almost controlling or manipulative that she demands you fire her and split the chores. Like you need to be brought to her level of life or she wants to exert dominance over what kind of lifestyle you will be living. Idk man, I\u2019d love to have assistance with cleaning the house if I could swing it, but some people don\u2019t like other people cleaning. Please update on what happens!", "NTA. Your gf is the problem. Maria seems like a nice employee. You need to get rid of the problem.", "NTA\n\nGuess who\u2019s going to wish she had maid service 5- or 10-years down the line with a career and possibly children? Amy. She is literally looking a gift horse in the mouth.", "I honestly thought I was gonna read this and see that Maria was younger and very attractive (not that she can\u2019t be at 57 cuz come on! Lol) and the gf was jealous and insecure about that. It does sound like she did this on purpose and I don\u2019t know maybe had her shower before kept her hair wet heard the doorbell then went back into the bathroom and was then \u201cbarged\u201d in on. Seems very off if she took the day off when she knew Maria was gonna  be there to wash the bathroom. You say there is a schedule does that include what time Maria shows up? I would be watching your gf. She seems very sketchy I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if things start to go \u201cmissing\u201d when Maria has been there.", "NTA. If your GF come from such a humble background - she should understand she\u2019s advocating for someone to lose their livelyhood and for what? Because she refuses to adjust? \n\nAlso if for some unfortunate reason you give in to your GF - insists she 100% takes the chores since she\u2019s the only one wanting to mess up the current situation", "NTA\n\n\"To try and calm her down I said maybe you're overreacting.\"\n\nDid you think that was actually going to work?", "Maria and her biological family probably rely on that income. Bet that doesn\u2019t even cross your GFs mind. NTA", "NTA-and if your GF wants to do her own chores that's fine. Though honestly the apartment is yours and you can choose to have Maria clean it. The only chore GF should have is her personal laundry? And if she wants to make her own meals?\n\nYou do not have to be forced to do household chores if you do not want to and have the means to pay someone else to do them.", "I think you've known Maria way longer than you've known Amy.  It sounds like she's really jealous of 'the maid' who is more to you than just a maid, she's been a friend of the family for a long time.  She either needs to get over it or she'll be looking for a new bf pretty quick.  You're exhausted from your medical residency and need help.  NTAH.", "NTA. Honestly id probably resent her if I did what she asked here so would just tell her that she can get over this shit now or leave. That or get one massive prenup lined up and tell her about it, that would take care of the issue either way.", "NTA.  Take care of Maria.", "NTA. Dump her and keep Maria.", "You do need to ditch one of these women but it's not the one she thinks it is.", "NTA - but I also get where the girlfriend is coming from even if she\u2019s not expressing it very well. I would not like having someone touching my things or in my space. If you guys are planning on building a life together then you\u2019ll need to choose. Lots of girls would love to have a maid but for others it would feel very invasive", "This is something that both partners need to agree on. If your GF doesn't want to have a stranger come clean the home where she lives, that's valid. And I'm wondering why Maria didn't hear the shower running? That seems odd to me.\n\nYou need to understand that she's uncomfortable having a house cleaner. I think she overreacted a bit to the shower situation, it was an accident, but again why wouldn't maria have heard the shower running? Also it would be a good habit to always knock on a closed bathroom door just in case.\n\nIDK if I wanna say you're T A here but I think your GF's feelings are valid. Maybe a compromise is in order, Maria could not clean the more private spaces and stick to the common areas. Or at least leave your bedroom and the bathroom you use alone (assuming you have an extra bathroom or extra bedrooms that aren't used as bedrooms).", "I'm Asian. We also treat househelp (especially those that have been with us for years) like family. I can only imagine the kind of wrath my mother would unleash if she hear somebody NOT YET PART OF THE FAMILY disrespect a person she trusts and cares for - especially if the help has always been there even before us kids were born.\n\nSorry to say this, but if you ever need to clean house (pun intended), you should start with dumping your girlfriend. Maybe the next one will be more rational and knows how to lock the darned bathroom when showering. NTA.", "NTA. Outsourcing work is not inherently bad.", "Will you give a pension to Maria?", "Spot on. It's blatantly obvious that she has a massive lifestyle inferiority complex that is now causing her to lash out at Maria, who's essentially an innocent bystander in all of this. I grew up poor, studied, got into a good career and eventually married into a much wealthier family, so I can understand how irrationally uncomfortable it is to suddenly have comforts paid by or chores done by others. It takes time to adjust to. I could tell you a lot of stories about it. \n\nBut that discomfort does not justify the GF's cruelty towards Maria, not her tantrum over this, nor her disregard towards OP's family ties to Maria. \n\nOP is NTA. GF sure is.", "You know, I\u2019d love to know if they\u2019ve discussed a prenup or not. If the answer is no, OP should bring it up, I bet her reaction would be very telling", "Does GF not understand that she\u2019s trying to rob Maria of her livelihood? Doesn\u2019t she care?", "Yeah if Amy just said can you tell Maria not to wash my clothes etc, that would be fine, just get two washing baskets.

How does she treat servers?", "Same, I'll ditch the gf/bf and let Maria continue working at my apartment. Trusted staff is harder to find than a new boyfriend.
