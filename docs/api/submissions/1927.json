He gets car sick on long rides to the point of being miserable and I\u2019m terrified of flying. It's usually not so bad when he\u2019s the one driving, but he also sees it as a massive hassle - driving obviously takes way longer and is more effort than just hopping on a plane. We usually just go somewhere local if we're in the mood for a trip, maybe an hour and a half drive at most. \n\nMy husband has to travel often for work. He and his business partner fly and stay together on these trips and I\u2019ve joked in the past that his business partner sees him more than I do. I understand that it\u2019s the nature of his job and I respect that, I just miss him. \n\nI\u2019ve been toying with the idea of joining my husband on one of these trips for a while, but it\u2019s only recently that I came up with the idea of surprising him. Even if it turned out that he was incredibly busy, I figured we could squeeze in at least one nice meal together at some point and I could explore the city alone. \n\nI put this plan into action after he left for his flight. The drive from our home to where he flew to was about 14 hours, so obviously it was a long way to go. Still, I thought it would be worth it and road-tripping by myself is something I haven\u2019t done in years. \n\nWhen I arrived, thanks to traffic and some other scheduling errors, it was relatively late at night. I had the hotel name and room number from my husband for emergency purposes, so I went up and knocked. No one answered, so I called him and hoped the surprise would still be as exciting despite the late hour. He picked up, clearly half asleep, and I told him to come out of his room. He finally did with some convincing. The door my husband came out of wasn't the one I had been knocking on, but the one directly beside it. I explained I had came to surprise him and apologized for arriving when I did. \n\nHis reaction was far from the one I expected. He was incredibly angry. He said it was irresponsible of me to drive such a long way without telling him. The said this was an unnecessary distraction and that he had to be up early the next morning. He also said that there had been a mix-up with their booking details and that they had been given a single room with a king bed instead of the two rooms they had requested. That had been a non-issue with two close friends, but now that I was there we had to go to the lobby to book another room.\n\nIt's the next day.

And while I have heard of it happening in sports teams, I also know how rampant of a problem sexual harassment is in most mainstream sports so that\u2019s not exactly a good comparison for your argument.", "My fianc\u00e9 stays out of town with work with coworkers and they always put them in one room but NEVER do single bed.", "Yes.  While there are exceptions, when you're talking about business travel, people absolutely get their own room.\n\nI have never, ever in my professional career traveled and seen anyone sharing rooms.  Trips with friends to save money?  Sure.", "No company is making employees share a bed.", "No corporate business with an HR department is making two employees share a king bed. Absolutely never.", "Yeah, I also doubt this post is real. But it was pretty entertaining. Especially some of these comments. lol. BUT if it is real, I do feel bad for OP...but wow is she naive...", "I mean they do sound pretty vacation incompatible\u2026.", "Because they\u2019re in denial.", "Even the business partner was a man, OPs husband could be bi or secretly gay", "I was waiting for the art room mention lol", "LMAO, your comment killed me. This situation isn\u2019t funny but those questions are hilarious. But in all seriousness, it needs to be answered. No matter the gender, it\u2019s odd.", "Bi people exist.", "Male", "which post is it??", "oscillating fan?", "As someone that used to travel for work quite often before COVID, if I was going to a conference (as an attendee not as a vendor), I'd occassionally bring my husband (upon approval from my boss first).\n\nHowever, if I'm going to see a client then absolutely not. Visiting clients require long days in meetings, tours, brainstorms, often dinner and drinks with them afterwards. It would also be 100% inappropriate and weird to bring your spouse to a business dinner with a client, even if it's supposed to be more social in nature, you still end up talking about business at some point and everyone that's there is affiliated with said business. Even when you're not with the client and you get back to your hotel, you can end up doing two things: staying up late finishing the presentation, notes, agenda or final prep for the next days meetings OR shower, pass out and usually get up early to try and fit in some work before you meet up again. I would be furious if my husband showed up to a work trip without asking me first. Also it's good business sense to run having your spouse there by your boss first for approval.\n\nThat being said I find it very very odd that they are sharing one bed. I have never ever had to share a bed with someone on a business trip. My vote is ESH. She is clueless on what it's like to have to go on a business trip and he's shady as can be.", "It's a BUSINESS TRIP. All of ot is working hours.", "True. It has for sure happened. If she had indicated that the business partner is female it's pretty cut and dry how inappropriate that is. Male it's a little more murky but I know most men are weirded out about sleeping in the same bed as another man so to me there would have to be more going on.", "Yes. Sometimes the person who pays and does booking is not the same person checking in and it can create quite a hassle for everyone involved when things need to be amended.", "I suppose anything's possible. You can fill in the blanks with anything your head imagines. I choose to think he's a secret agent on a mission that's why the room change. About as much info to conclude that as others have to conclude he is cheating.", "I don't think you would be at risk of loosing. \n\nHe was/is checked into that room.", "If they booked a room with 2 bed but the hotel only had a king-size, all these speculations come crashing down. Some businesses give you limits to what you can spend, 2 separate rooms may have been over budget.", "Their entire post history is commenting on AITA posts, usually in a snarky manner. I don't think they are a \"full grown\" mature adult like they accuse you of \"obviously\" not being, and probably not worth arguing with. Just as a heads up.", "I know I did not say he was secretly gay I said secretly closeted which mean closeted as bi or gay either one.", "I\u2019m an admin assistant and I have booked a literal ton of hotel rooms and this has never happened to any of the bookings. Hotels make it right if they mix something up and will do whatever they can to fix the issue. At the very least they would have upgraded the room to something bigger or even brought in a roll away bed. Even after you arrived you still got your own room (so there was availability) AND you spent the night in there alone?", "And historians said they were good friends and roomates \n\n NTA- But OP your husband is either in the closet and cheating or out and about and  cheating.\n\nPlease hire a PI, lawyer up and goodluck", "NTA, maybe your husband is gay", "your husband is a cheater.", "The other guy froze and pretended to be asleep. \u201cNothing to see here\u201d except you saw it with your own two eyes, and there were other rooms available. \n\nINFO: What would have to happen for you to feel assured you saw exactly what you saw? Don\u2019t let them continue gaslight you! You caught him in bed red handed with someone else. \n\nYour shock probably didn\u2019t let you process what you were seeing at first, but you\u2019ve had time to reflect now. I assure you you\u2019ll be grateful to yourself if you confront it head on.", "Your husband is cheating and about to build an art room for his partner- lawyer up", "INFO: doesnyour husband like surprises? \n\nI seriously doubt your husband is cheating on you with his coworker. You woke your husband up in the middle of the night after a long day of working and having to start early the next day. My husband hates surprises and he hates even more to be awake in the middle of the night. If he saw me outside his room like your husband did, he would probably be first concerned, and then annoyed. If my husband and surprised me like you did, I'd probably react better but wouldn't be ecstatic either. Whenever I go on business trips in cool places, my husband flies over at the end of the period I have to work and we enjoy some time together then. Business trips are usually packed with meetings and very stressful. He's now probably also stressed that he has to make time for you, even if you say he doesn't have to.\n\nETA missing paragraph.", "Ok then most likely not cheating unless he is secretly closeted but that is unlikely. I think it could just be a bit of he was tired and overreacting in the moment but I can\u2019t be sure as I am not him I would suggest tonight just explain where you were coming from like you know it\u2019s a business trip and he will be working but that you thought maybe at night you guys could spend some time having dinner or whatever. And ask him why he was so angry and ask him to explain it to you so you can understand his feelings.", "Right! Like where can we read it! \ud83d\ude00", "No. Booking an additional room when they are available is not quite a hassle and is preferable to a company insisting two employees share a bed.\n\nMost Western companies (I'll accept this may not be true world wide) of the sort that have business trips also have tedious anti harassment videos that teach employees not to do a whole raft of behaviours that may be construed as sexual harassment. Forcing an employee to sleep in your bed definitely qualifies!", "Yikes. Hope your employer figures out how to handle employee travel better. Most employers who book a lot of travel have a number for people to call to connect with a travel agent to sort out problems , or they trust employees with a company card and sort out the details later. Your employer sounds like they\u2019re not very good at it. Just know there are employers out there who would never leave their employees in this situation. You can find a better employer.", "\u201cHe also said that there had been a mix-up with their booking details and that they had been given a single room with a king bed instead of the two rooms they had requested.\u201d", "Oh I definitely think this post is bullshit... who goes \u201croad-tripping\u201d for 14 hours to surprise their SO, finds them in a super weird \u201chotel room\u201d situation with another \u201cman\u201d (we all assumed business partner is male) & asks if THEY are an asshole.", "You said it matters a lot if the business partner is male or female. It really doesn't because bi people exist", "Bet her room has 2 queens! Op??", "Um did you miss the part where hotel has plenty of rooms with extra beds and 2 grown men chose to sleep together over asking for the \"other\" room he lied to her about??", "She rocked up to his hotel late at night while he was on a work trip and completely blindsided him when he had to wake up early the next day for work.\n\n\n\nNow, if he's not cheating, then OP is completely TA, and I'm interested to know just how much she has compromised on their travel plans to destinations.", "Lol obviously you have never worked in the music/touring industry. There is no HR, corporate office structure, sexual harassment videos. It's not like the office.\n\nIdk why people can't understand that their experiences in the world aren't the only experiences.", "Yea they were not very good at it at all. One of the reasons I left and joined another company. Thanks for your concern! \n\nThat said it is in the music touring industry so it's not regular corporate structured companies with HR and regular office hours.", "Yes because it matter in the context of this situation because if you go by him being married to her and as far as I am aware most likely told her he is straight so then it would matter because if the business partner is a woman then there would be more reason for her specifically think he could be cheating but since it is a man unless he is secretly a closeted bit or gay man then no reason for her to think he is cheating. In general no it does not matter because people have all different sexuality\u2019s. There are people who are attracted to personality not gender and some who don\u2019t have a defined gender but I am specifically referring to her situation now maybe he has always been bi and told her then it wouldn\u2019t matter but as she hasn\u2019t said that I assume he told her he was straight", "It\u2019s not her being an asshole wanting to surprise your husband a lot of mean and women do it all the time it doesn\u2019t make her an asshole. And to be fair to her she was meant to arrive earlier in the day but thank you traffic and other things she arrived late at night. So if she had arrived earlier would it then be ok and it\u2019s a surprise not a blindside", "Fine. I also find that annoying.\n\nBut now explain the 'quite the hassle' that is booking an additional room.", "Yeah I've heard that the entertainment industry can be pretty fucked up with sexual harassment.", "The rooms sometimes are booked and payed for by the promoter who is bringing us to play a show. Sometimes you check in at midnight or later due to travel. And when an issue arises with the booking it's in the name of the promoter and he is unreachable at this hour. You are a struggling musician/band and not willing to offer up your own credit card to book a new room. The front desk person can't change things without authorization from the promoter who's card it's under. \n\nThis is just one example off the top my head.\n\nNot everyone has an HR office they can call or checking in at normal hours. Sometimes you're a small business trying to make it."]}
