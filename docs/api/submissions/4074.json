Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.", "created_utc": 1670327919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze4qw3/aita_for_banishing_my_teenage_daughters_friend/", "score": 10719, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it was a genuine error of someone unfamiliar with you trying to complement your husband and accidentally offending you. She\u2019s 14 which I remember as a socially awkward and embarrassing time. You\u2019re allowed to be a bit hurt but, as long as it doesn\u2019t happen again, you should put it down to a one time slip up.", "YTA. Did it ever occur to you that the reason this girl and your daughter \u201cclicked\u201d as friends is that they\u2019re *both* socially awkward? \n\nShe\u2019s a 14 year old kid. Even with the best social skills, they often put their foot in their mouths. Let it go. Don\u2019t ruin your daughter\u2019s friendship because your ego was hurt by one off hand comment.", "YTA - she\u2019s a 14 year old girl. You are being a bully!!  \n\nIf your daughter is an introvert/socially awkward maybe the type of friends she attracts are that way too?\n\nWhat if some grown woman was demanding your child apologize to her for making a comment months ago (presumably a true observation) in exchange for being allowed to socially visit with her child?  \n\nThe tables are going to turn on your daughter because other parents won\u2019t want their child around you.", "If you wanted to choose this battle you had to do it then. Too late.", "YTA.\n\nIf 14 is old enough to apologize, 37 is old enough to communicate that at the time. You've taken an awkward moment that this girl probably wishes she could forget and made it into some huge issue. Have some grace, let it go, let her think it's forgotten. And let your daughter have a friend, ffs.", "YTA. You should have asked for an apology at the table. What she said was very rude, and I think she knew it as soon as it came out of her mouth, but she didn\u2019t know what to do to make it right. If you\u2019d said \u201cthat\u2019s was very rude, and I\u2019d like an apology\u201d she would have said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d right there, and while awkward, it would have been over. \n\nYou missed your teaching moment. Holding a grudge for months against a 14-year-old is silly, and you\u2019re punishing your daughter unfairly. Let the kid have a friend.", "You said yourself that she seemed to realize she'd messed up after she said it. The poor girl was probably mortified, especially if she's socially awkward. She wasn't trying to insult you. She's a teenager who said the wrong thing. \n\nIf she knows you're still holding a grudge and demanding an apology she will be too embarrassed to ever come back to your house. You are costing your daughter her only friend because you can't just be the adult in this situation. Get over it. YTA", "Yta. Be an adult and MOVE ON from a comment made in the past. Instead, PARENT the child if it happens again and make clear that future comments will not be appreciated. What you\u2019re doing now is just stopping to a low, juvenile level.", "I don't want to call you an A-Hole but at the same it was an over reaction. Sometimes kids will say dumb stuff when they feel under pressure or in a new situation, no matter how confident a teenager comes across there's always that sense of social awkwardness. \nBest bet would be to let it slide for now, if a similar situation reoccurs then just say that you don't appreciate comments like that because you find it insulting/uncomfortable. I doubt your daughter's new friend went out of her way to be unpleasant and was probably just trying to be \"grown up\" or \"funny\" or something. \nDon't let it bother you, it's great your daughter has made a friend and that should be the main thing of importance.", "YTA. Are you really this touchy about your weight that you\u2019re preventing your child from having friends? You say your daughter is socially awkward. Your description of how you interact with her and her friends is a massive clue as to why. She\u2019s likely not \u201csocially awkward\u201d at all and instead is constantly walking on eggshells so as to not upset anyone, as she has learned to do from you. One throwaway comment and you ban her friend from the home. She\u2019s not an \u201cintrovert\u201d, you\u2019ve taught her to be very wary of how she behaves so she keeps her self to herself. Your reactivity and insecurity is costing her her childhood. \n\nYour feelings about your body are yours to own.", "YTA. You said your daughter is socially awkward to the point of having her tested. Birds of a feather flock together. This girl absolutely did not mean to insult you. \n\nYou, as the adult, should have and could have used the opportunity to talk about appropriate comments and kindness but instead chose to ignore it. \n\nI think inviting her into your home is appropriate especially if this is your daughters only friend. If you feel so inclined, let her know how the comment upset you and moving forward you\u2019d appreciate if any jokes were made not involving anyone\u2019s weight in the house. A healthy boundary to set.", "As a bigger woman myself, YTA. Kids say dumb things. \n\nOnce a kid came up to me in the mall and said, \u201cEwwww, you\u2019re fat!\u201d  I responded, \u201cEwww, you have brown hair!\u201d\n\nShe ran off crying to her mother.", "YTA\n\nTeenagers say dumb things. And the time to correct it was in the moment.\n\nLet the faux pas slide, but if it happens again, explain why it isn't ok to joke like that with you.\n\nThis is your daughter's friendship, keep the peace.", "Yes, YTA. And I think I know at least part of the reason your daughter is an introvert.  This is a total overreaction on your part.  You have held onto this one comment for months?  It isn\u2019t even an for sure an insult.  Do you really think she was consciously thinking about how she could upset you and decided she would do so by saying you are bigger?  She pointed out something everyone can see - you\u2019re bigger.  And you took it in the harshest possible way.  You used the word banish.  Like a dark ages leave the village fend for yourself in the wild punishment.  You didn\u2019t just decline. You want her banished. \n\nI think you might be dumping years of frustration about being a bigger woman on a 14 year old girl, who, if she is friends with your daughter, might be a bit of an introvert and a little awkward herself, and probably doesn\u2019t have polished social skills you require.  I bet you  never had those perfect skills at her age either.  And I have no ides what you get out of it.  This isn\u2019t the 1700\u2019s, your honor has not been besmirched.  Let it go.  \n\nYou say you\u2019re happy your daughter has a friend. I don\u2019t buy it.  And I have news for you: no 14 year old *your daughter included* owns up to all their screw ups.  \n\nIn fact YOU don\u2019t own up to all of your screw ups.  How do I know? You\u2019re not doing it now.  Drop it and apologize before you lose your daughter.", "YTA - are you sure you are an adult?  Your kid who is socially awkward finally has a friend who is also socially awkward and you want to punish them both?", "YTA. It\u2019s been months, let it go. Not addressing it when it happened is your oversight, not your daughter\u2019s or even her friend\u2019s. She put her foot in her mouth, and holding onto it this long only makes you seem petty and insecure.", "YTA, not for wanting an apology, but for waiting until months after the fact. You should have corrected her at the dinner table, she would've apologized and it would be over. \n\nYou don't hold a grudge against a 14yr old for months and then expect them to 1) remember the situation or 2) feel remorse or learn anything from their actions. It's like when you have a toddler, you punish them quickly after the fact so they know what they've done was wrong and understand why they're being punished. I.e. \"that wasn't nice, \" \"I'm sorry\" and it's done.", "YTA kids say stupid stuff all the time and she was clearly embarrassed by it. You said yourself your daughter does not have alot of friends. Don't ruin her one friendship", "YTA. She's 14, your daughter's *only friend* and is clearly also socially awkward.  She made a gaff. It didn't sound like it was out of meanness - it was just a stupid thing to say that may have sounded funny in her own head but fell flat.   \n\nYou would have your daughter lose her only friend (which is what will happen if you push for an apology) just to get an apology from a 14 year old.  Let's be honest. You are not teaching her a lesson, you are out for revenge for a slight.  I hope it's worth the cost your daughter will pay.", "YTA and you already know it. 14 year olds are just awkward as fuck and your acting like she did something horrific", "YTA. Stop it.\n\nYou're the adult here; don't pick a fight with a 14 year old child. It's clear this kid didn't mean to upset you. Do you really want to sabotage your own child's friendships because of your ego? You don't 'need' an apology. You need to act like an adult and shake it off.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nI also think it's pretty disgusting that you're putting your daughter in the middle of this. Because you didn't properly address the perceived slight at the time, you now expect your daughter to tell her friend she has to apologise to you while you sit on your throne and wait.", "YTA. A phony apology will make you happy? I\u2019ve seen people try to get teenagers to apologize. It does not end well.\n\nI suggest you find something else to focus your anger on. The comment happened months ago, let it go.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH. But maybe you don\u2019t have to be so hard on her. You can give her another chance and see how she acts from here on out. It could have just been a one time awkward joke that did not land as your husband pointed out, and it seemed that she did realise she messed it up then. Being an awkward teenager, she might have been embarrassed and didn\u2019t know how to act after that. If after giving her another chance and she repeatedly makes such insensitive remarks, then she definitely owes you an apology (or more). Besides, it\u2019s hard for your daughter to make a friend so maybe you can let this one slide.", "YTA. Move on. You are an adult. It wasn't even a hateful derogatory statement. If anything, women of all body types are being celebrated in the media lately and at her impressionable age it might have been a well-meant, positive comment. \n\nLet your insecurities go. She's a teenager, not some coworker, and possibly one of your daughter's only friends.", "If you had talked to the friend at the time (\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on people\u2019s weight like that in this house. It\u2019s pretty hurtful.\u201d) and she didn\u2019t apologize, you\u2019d be perfectly justified. \n\nHowever, expecting an apology months later when you didn\u2019t address the issue at the time is, frankly, petty. Teenagers are not the best at reading social cues and often blurt things out without thinking them through first. The adults are supposed to guide them into more thoughtful and considerate behavior. \n\nSo\u2026right now, YTA. Let your daughter bring her friend over and let this go. The next time the friend says something awkward, address it calmly at the time.", "YTA, that seems really thin skinned and narrow minded from an adult that got - probably more due to awkwardness rather than intention - insulted by a 14-year old. You felt insulted, but you are also not willing to go to the one that insulted you and tell them but put pressure on your daughter.", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t address it at the time now is too late. If it happens again address it at the time and then move on.", "Bigger woman here. You're overreacting. Your daughter is socially awkward and so are her friends. I don't think she meant to insult you. She was just forgetting her filter. You can correct her on the spot and tell her what she should do to handle it next time. But don't cheat your daughter of this friendship. YTA", "YTA\nShe is just a kid who said something dumb. She wasnt trying to insult you. One of you is going to have to be the grownup here, why should it have to be the child?", "NTA, but also kind of YTA for different reasons.\n\nNTA for expecting an apology. She's 14, not 4, it's not beyond her skill set as a teenager to simply apologize nor is it asking for much. If she knows her \"please's\" and \"thank you's\" then she also knows how to say sorry. Ik she was likely too ashamed to say anything after the joke, but she could have come to you later or the next day and said it then. \n\nHowever, the fact this happened months ago and it's fresh in your head is somewhat childish. You know it was a *really* bad joke, but you've clearly taken it as a personal slight against you. Your daughter is awkward, so the friends she makes are likely to be similar, her socialising skills aren't going to be great and she was likely nervous as all hell meeting what could be one of her only friends parents.", "YTA here. \n\nIf you feel it necessary, you _could_ say to your daughter\u2019s hard-earned friend, \u201cHey FRIEND, I want to let you know that what you said at dinner the last time you were here really hurt my feelings, and it\u2019s stuck with me. I hope in future you\u2019ll consider what impact your words might have on those who hear them so that you don\u2019t end up hurting people who are being nice to you.\u201d \n\nThis might make it a moment where an adolescent learns a little about being a grownup and about how to walk through the world. \n\nYour choice here is just going to further isolate a young woman who by your own description is already somewhat isolated. \n\nThink about it. Please.", "YTA if you were so offended you should have addressed it then, when the kid was *spending the night* not months later. Also you are an adult holding a grudge against a teenager who made an off hand comment, but you in no way attempted to use this as an opportunity to teach her (and your daughter) that comments like that are unintentionally hurtful.", "YTA. \n\nNot sure why you couldn't have just used that moment as a teaching moment. The kid is 14. It may have been a ill-planned joke, but I don't think it was meant to be malicious. \n\nJust politely tell the kid that's inappropriate & was uncalled for. Then move on. If the kid can't move past that, then sure, stronger measures need to be taken. If the kid never does it again tho, haven't they learned?\n\nEdit to add: I get being concerned that the people your kids hang out with are good people. As a mom, I worry about that too. \n\nForcing an apology when you hardly know the kid yet *and* when the kid already seems remorseful...who does that help? Not them, not your kid. It helps *you.* \n\nYou say your kid has struggled making friends, and now they've made one. Is this apology important enough to cause that friendship to end? \n\nYour kid is right. This was *months* ago. It won't do any good to bring it up again.", "YTA. You should have asked for an apology at the time or let it go. What the kid said wasn't even rude - inappropriate perhaps, but that's kids for you, especially socially awkward ones. If you're big, own it - don't hold a grudge against some kid because you're upset about your weight.", "Insisting on an apology isn\u2019t a big deal and is appropriate.  NTA", "None of the response labels quite fit, it\u2019s a combo of ESH and YTA.\n\nThe kid misspoke and said something rude. She should have apologized, but I bet her introverted ass felt too awkward to speak. You\u2019re NTA for being hurt by this, but if you were going to demand an apology, it should have been immediately after. From everyone else\u2019s POV, you dropped it for weeks/months and are now dragging it back out. This looks petty to them. I\u2019m sure your daughter is interpreting it as you being petty to mess with her, that\u2019s how teenage girls think.\n\nYou have the right to be upset by this, but do you want to torpedo your daughter\u2019s friendship over something so silly? Being a parent means putting our kids first. Even when our pride is hurt, even when we don\u2019t want to. Even when it\u2019s hard. \n\nInvite the kid over and chat with her if you must. But be an adult. This \u201cshe can\u2019t come over until she does this arbitrary thing\u201d stuff needs to go. Just because you have the right to do crap like this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy, helpful to the situation, or the best thing for your kiddo.", "What if that friend IS on the spectrum? And that\u2019s why she missed a cue and said something  unintentionally offensive. \n\nI understand your position but I actually think you need to give her another chance. And maybe this is the stuff that causes your daughter to be more introverted. She might be terrified of saying something wrong or offensive to someone so she keeps to herself. \n\nSoft YTA.  Give the friend another chance.", "YTA. Have you thought that your daughter's friend might  also be socially awkward? She's 14yo and she realized she Fu***d up. Do you think she has the social experience of an adult to have handled the situation right in that moment? Let the girl go back to your house and see if those \"jokes\" are a bad attitude or just a mistake. \nI understand that body-shaming is bad, but come on. Suck it up and see.", "Are you really going to prevent your daughter from having this one single friend because she called you fat? Is this the hill you wanna die on?....I'm also really introverted and can confidently tell you that this will prevent your daughter from having the courage to make other friends because this is how you react to kids trying to make a joke. Their brains are still developing and sometimes they can't control what just comes out of their mouths.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like your daughters friend intentionally insulted you. You should be able to let it go and move on. If you absolutely have to you could calmly and reasonably explain to her when she comes over next that what she said hurt your feelings and give a gentle reminder that words hurt and be careful what you say to people. Absolutely do not banish her from the house because of a simple mistake. That will hurt your daughter and is completely uncalled for. Don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t say something stupid when you were 14, we all did.", "YTA only because it's been a couple months. You need to address these issues when they happen, with words, not months later, with a cold shoulder and a grudge. You could have even told her parents what she said if you didn't feel comfortable parenting their daughter, but that's not your issue here, because you clearly say that you're trying to teach her a lesson. All you're teaching her, and your own daughter and husband, is that you're petty and you hold grudges against children.", "YTA. Agreed with everyone that it should have been handled in the moment. Also, part of being an adult is having a CONVERSATION if someone hurts your feelings, not just expecting them to immediately know what they did wrong and apologize, especially if the other person is a literal child. I think it\u2019s totally appropriate to have a QUICK conversation about it, say the comment hurt your feelings but you know she didn\u2019t mean to and you forgive her, but that words have power to hurt people. Then be done with it and MOVE ON.", "YTA - the kid was being an awkward kid.  Get over it.", "ESH\nHonestly this girl sounds a bit like me. When I was younger I would try hard to give a genuine compliment, but unintentionally say something borderline offensive. It's quite mortifying to think of it now, but back then I thought I was being nice.\n\nI don't think it's wrong of you to explain why is it not okay and ask for apology. This will help her grow. However you completely missed your timing. This should have been addressed there and then. Now you just look petty.", "YTA. Teens get flustered and say stupid things. I remember my friend in high school attended a funeral and got so nervous when in the family receiving online that she accidentally said \u201ccongratulations\u201d instead of expressing her sympathies. Your daughter\u2019s friend was so focused on complimenting the cook that she put her foot in her mouth with you. Be gracious and move on. If it happens again then perhaps reevaluate.", "YTA. Your daughters friend isn\u2019t responsible for all the worlds slights against you, or for every time a mean spirited comment was made towards you. Was it insensitive? Yes, but the friend may be just as \u201csocially awkward\u201d as your daughter and didn\u2019t know how to react after she realized she had insulted you. It\u2019s been months. It\u2019s fine to gently tell the girl she hurt your feelings, but it is absolutely not okay to banish your daughters friend because she accidentally offended you. It\u2019s also weird to hold a grudge against a 14 year old instead of addressing the problem when it happened.", "YTA. A demanded apology is a fake apology. This is a 14 year old child who may have been nervous and blurted out a thoughtless remark. Besides, if you are a \"bigger\" woman, then it was a factual statement and she sees nothing wrong with a person being heavy. It's not her fault you're sensitive about it.", "YTA, she was insensitive, but it is rather odd to be holding a grudge against a kid. She most likely knows that she's wrong, and if she says something like that again you can just correct her. Don't get in the way of your child's positive friendships.", "NTA\n\nThat being said, I do think that you should have spoken up, and said something to this girl as soon as she said what she said. I think that 14 years old is old enough to realize/know that you shouldn't call someone fat, or say that they're \"a bigger woman\" because their husband/spouse is a good cook.", "YTA I had to reread to check how old you are, this is so ridiculously childish not to mention immature. Grow up.", "YTA. It *is* weird to demand an apology from a 14 year old child over a joke, albeit a joke that lacked taste. She\u2019s a kid, you\u2019re an almost 40 year old adult. It\u2019s very strange that you\u2019re not able to move past a child\u2019s bad taste humor months after the fact.", "Wow you\u2019re holding a grudge against a 14 year old?? Do you hear yourself. She made a off the cuff remark, she\u2019s a child. It obviously struck you to your core but you\u2019re blowing it out of proportion. I\u2019d say grow up but we already see you how take those things YTA", "Of course YTA she didn't even call you fat, she called you a \"larger woman\". You feel fat that's why you felt offended. You seem to be very insecure about your weight but clearly not as much to do something about it. She's 14, kids at that age are not always politically correct and say things as they see them.", "Yta. You're projecting your insecurities about your weight onto a 14yr old who probably felt awkward as hell, who tried to make a joke and who got it wrong. Who hasnt, I'm 30 and still say the wrong thing when my anxiety is really bad. I know to say sorry now, but at 14 that would have been the most terrifying scary thing. \nLet it go. For the sake of your daughter having her first friend. Do you really want to be responsible for ruining her first proper friendship because a 14yr old said the wrong thing. She will grow up and probably think about it a lot and feel sorry!", "Unpopular but NTA. At 14, you're old enough to know when something you say is hurtful and that you should apologize for it. You arent telling your daughter that they can't be friends, just that she needs to apologize before she's welcome to stay the night at your house.", "YTA, she\u2019s a child and probably didn\u2019t even mean it as a joke but just said something as she saw it and realized immediately afterwards she had accidentally been rude. You could pull her aside quietly and say it hurt your feelings, some people feel bad about being bigger so you need to be careful, but that you are happy she\u2019s friends with her daughter. She will ACTUALLY learn something about hurting people then.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking your hurt feelings out on your daughter. You said your daughter is \u201csocially awkward\u201d did you ever consider that her friend might be too? If she seemed to realize her misstep then she was probably embarrassed and being 14 didn\u2019t know how to handle it", "YTA\n\nYou don't have to like all your daughters friends and it sounds like she wasn't necessarily trying to be rude to you but complimenting your husband and it came out wrong. \n\nBeing called fat isn't an insult when it's a fact, source: fellow fat woman. If you don't like it then start working on losing weight. Also curious if she's fat as well because she may feel as I do about that not being a big deal. \n\nAnd this is her only friend? It's been 2 months, get over it.\n\nUnless she's starts making overtly insulting comments to you, then consider what happened a misunderstanding\n\nAlso - the time to address this was at the moment, not 2 months later.", "YTA. She was clearly giving you a compliment that she worded poorly because she\u2019s probably as awkward of a teen as your daughter. It\u2019s a shame as a grown adult that a 14 year old girl can still get under your skin. \n\nIf it was a problem you should address it immediately. You let it go so did everyone else.", "She didn\u2019t even make fun of you though? You\u2019re behaving like a teenager in all of this as well instead of as the adult who has experience with socially awkward teenagers who clearly meant no harm. YTA", "YTA\n\n\nIf you had an issue, you should've brought it up at the time. \n\n\nShe wasn't being derogatory, she wasn't making fun of your weight.

We have two kids; a 14-year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son.\n\nOur daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and mey daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This friendship sounds like an important step for your daughter. \n\nHowever, should the friend say something awkwardly rude again take the opportunity to kindly point it out, and make it a teachable moment.

I understand this hurt your feelings, BUT I wonder if your daughter's friend might be on the spectrum. My friends daughter is on the spectrum & I remember when she was younger, it was hard for her to understand why the truth is hurtful.  This means that if you are on the bigger side like I was, then the girl may have said this, then realized in the moment she might have said something wrong but didn't know how to handle it afterward. Seems to me you are making a mountain out of a mole hill.

We never know what someone is going through or why their body looks the way it does, so it's better not to speculate.\" This might have even opened up a conversation!

But on top of that,when you clearly notice that you have said something inappropriate, it's important to own that and apologize, not pretend it didn't happen. Even if owning it and apologizing is awkward and uncomfortable\" I'm going to guess that if you did this the next time she came over she WOULD apologize.

YTA", "YTA. It doesn't sound like she meant it as an insult, more like a compliment to your husband's cooking. And she also said \"bigger\", she didn't say \"no wonder you got so fat\". Also, yeah, she probably felt the awkwardness and didn't know what to do, so she just stayed silent. And I don't think she owes you an apology because she did not \"make fun of your weight\".

She's a socially awkward 14 year old, show her what a grown up looks like.", "YTA \n\nThough I will preface by saying what your daughters friend said was rude and clearly hurt your feelings - which is perfectly understandable.\n\nI was considering ESH but here\u2019s the thing: this girl is 14. Judging by your description of your daughter, I\u2019m assuming her friend is pretty similar - introverted, perhaps a little awkward? I don\u2019t think she meant to hurt your feelings, I think she was just trying to make a compliment to the food and didn\u2019t realize how she said it is my assumption. Then, once she realized, she likely thought an apology would be awkward as she\u2019d have to bring it up again. For that reason I think she is NTA, she made a mistake and was probably hoping you\u2019d forget to avoid confrontation and making the situation awkward again. I\u2019m not saying this was the best way to approach the situation, but please keep in mind she is 14 so her brain is not even near fully developed and she was shy upon meeting her friends parents for the first time. She will learn how to better approach these things with age and I\u2019m guessing she felt very awkward and learned from this experience.\n\nAs for why you are TA either way - you\u2019re 37 and trying to force an apology out of a 14 year old girl who you barely know. Not to mention your daughter has a hard time making friends. The girl may just find this situation super uncomfortable and awkward and choose to stop talking to your daughter or at least talk to her less or might not want to come over anymore. Is it really worth it? I already explained the (likely) rationale of the girl. I highly doubt her intentions were malicious. I understand your feelings were hurt but i just don\u2019t think this is a hill worth dying on. you admitted she seemed to notice her mistake and I doubt she would make it again. If the situation was going to be such a big deal, I think you needed to address it at the time, not 3 months later. I could see the issue if this was a repeated accident but so far it has only happened once.", "YTA. The time to say something is when she said it.

If not let it go", "Let it go. \nYTA", "She said you were a bigger woman. That doesn't sound like it was supposed to be an insult, just an (possibly insensitive) observation.

Grow up.\n\nAnd as a formerly very fat person, let me tell you it's easier in this world if you manage to grow a thicker skin about factual information. Sure, you can give idiots who point it out a dirty look especially the ones who insult you and are looking for a victim. The ones who are well-meaning or clueless. . . eh. Ignoring is easier than confronting, I think.\n\nBut fat itself isn't the horrorific insult  you seem be reeling from months later. If it's not true, then you got no reason to react so strongly.

The joke your daughter's friend made was her attempt at having an in with you, and by all accounts it failed. \n\nWhat I also know about adolescents (ESPECIALLY the awkward ones) is that they don't quickly forget the embarrassing/awkward things they do. This girl is mortified by what she said. Any time she thinks of coming to your house, she experiences a wave of embarrassment because of what she said. She probably even felt a little nervous just being around your daughter for awhile afterward. She's already paid her penance in regret and shame - forcing her to apologize would only make it worse (and would likely feel like punishment).\n\nI'm not going to vote because I understand where you're coming from and I don't think you've got any ill intention.  But demanding an apology really isn't necessary. Be the grown-up this kid needs and give her a little grace.", "[removed]", "YTA. This adult *needs* a child to apologize. The child is expected to have more emotional regulation than does OP. \n\nAlso, maybe OP is socially awkward.

It could be coming from your own insecurities or perception. I\u2019d say always look at the intention. The girl didn\u2019t mean to insult you. She just got carried away and said something that came to her mind unfiltered and with the understanding of a fourteen year old. \n\nYour daughter is finally trying to branch out and has found a like minded friend. Maybe just have an open conversation and tell her that if it happens again she should speak to her friend and talk it out. Forcing an apology is the worst way to deal with this", "This so much. OP, YTA, for not having the compassion for your daughters friend that you would expect for your own daughter.", "I couldn't put it better myself.

Two peas in a pod and she's blocking one out for being socially awkward. \n\nYou have to forgive and forget with kids.

Birds of a feather flock together is a saying for a reason lol ETA : YTA OP!", "I'll add that even for purely selfish reasons, OP has a choice between showing a little grace and teaching her awkward daughter that the punishment for trying is exile.

Even if she apologizes I suspect she will feel so nervous around you now that she's unlikely to want to hang around your house much.

So I can see why the daughter worries this will ruin her friendship because it makes it awkward.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound to me like the comment was even meant as an insult, just a quirky observation. I can see how OP would see it as one, but the time to address it has well passed and the daughter is absolutely right that it\u2019s awkward now. Being a 14 year old girl is tough, and being one who is awkward, possibly neurodivergent or someone is even tougher. What does OP actually \u201cget\u201d from this apology scheme besides the girl\u2019s discomfort? Does she really think the girl was \u201cmean girl\u201ding her?

Because someone got their feelings hurt means they are automatically deserved an apology?

The girl was complimenting OPs husbands food and tried to make a stupid joke and it didn\u2019t work. I personally don\u2019t think she was trying to be rude based on the context of the comment and therefore OP, a grown ass woman, needs to get over it. The girl is 14, not 24.

She may have simply been trying to interact by using an interaction she'd seen before as a template. Plus, my friend's parents always made me nervous at that age.

I found it really difficult to make friends because I was a lot like him. My friend group once did an intervention and told me I'm a bitch. I didn't understand. They were like: it's not even really the information, it's the way you sarcastically deliver it without any regard for how it makes someone feel. Took me *a lot* of practice to mimic appropriate social behaviors. \n\nMy sister and I also got really, really close to our dad before the end of his life.

I\u2019d wager a guess that the reason she went silent the rest of the night was she was stewing in embarrassment over putting her foot in her mouth.

In another context, the kiddo might have said that and everyone laughed and said, \"You bet!\" The OP can feel how she feels, for sure, but forcing a huge embarrassing apology out of the teen is just not worth it.

OP is the *actual* adult here but she\u2019s acting like a child.", "Seriously! Personally I would have laughed it off. The kid has two working eyeballs and I am fat. If you don\u2019t have an issue with it, no one else will either. And If they do, it\u2019s their problem not mine.\n\nOP it is months later and you\u2019re still stewing about what a 14 year old said. That\u2019s a lot of mental real estate for a non-malicious comment. YTA", "\"Larger woman\".... That's almost a politically correct term! I'm dying over here.", "Especially with the whole \"teach in the moment\" thing. Even adults mess up with that, and who's to say that if she had said something and corrected the comment that OPs daughter wouldn't have lost the friend because of it?", "\u201cFind your inner Elsa and bottle up your feelings until it destroys the economy!\u201d", "The post isnt even about the husband, yet AITA still manages to turn it against the husband.", "I'm curious what you think he should have done differently.  White-knighted for his wife at the table or failed to stick up for his daughter months later?  It's not like he said, \"Well, you *are* fat,\" or even \"It's not that bad.\"  He said it wasn't *intended* badly, and clearly it wasn't.", "No let\u2019s not talk about that. Fuck off with that nonsense. She\u2019s an adult but my feeeeeelings. It\u2019s not his job.", "Why is it her husbands job to monitor her feelings about her own weight? That\u2019s ridiculous", "It's rude to make personal comments, fat or thin, about people's bodies. It has nothing to do with how one takes it. It's still rude.", "Hey, thanks!", "The ocean is for tools!", "Name one such culture please so I can retire there.", "How about the fact that the a comment from a 14 year old is living rent free in the OPs head. That\u2019s more concerning to me than the comment the 14 year old made.", "I teach 14 year olds. If I reacted to what my abuse TA say like the Op did here I would never leave my house. Kids this age say stupid and thoughtless stuff. \n\nI always tell a student, \u201cI know you but not everyone does. You need to be careful how you talk to people because they may hear what you said and think you are saying z, y or z.\u201d  Also, I don\u2019t automatically assume every comment is an insult. Maybe their grandmother or mom is larger and they associate larger with someone they know is happy.", "The DSM defines autism with the symptoms that typically present in males. Autism presents differently in females, so females are regularly misdiagnosed because their symptoms do not match the DSM symptoms. I am a female and did not get diagnosed with ASD until my 30s. Before then all my psychiatrists said I had ADHD, auditory processing disorder, and an eating disorder.", "Bad bot", "But if we boil down to WHY she would feel self-conscious about her weight, we arrive at internalized fatphobia. Society has taught her (and everyone else) that having fat on your body is bad and ugly, so she thinks fat in her body is bad and ugly. This is the definition of fatphobia. I\u2019m not demonizing her for it, I think most people deal with fatphobic thoughts and feelings, I know that I sure do, but let\u2019s call a spade and spade. It\u2019s the first step to breaking down those fatphobic thoughts.", "\"Well thank you for the compliment on the food, [name]. Just for the future though, it's impolite to talk about someone's size so we don't do that here.\" \n\nThat's it. Teaching moment, awkwardness averted, end of story.", "It wasn't even nasty or especially rude, tbh. \"A bigger woman\" isn't the same as \"lard ass\" or \"beached whale\" or any number of awful things I've heard over the years. \n\nAnd I may have read it wrong but it sounds like it was a compliment to OP's cooking?", "The ocean is awesome and for winners! You\u2019re for tools.", "30 Rock", "I overheard my mom say something to my aunt about her jiggly neck one time. I parroted it back to her later, not even trying to be mean, I just thought it was ok to be casually discussed since I heard her casually discuss it. \n\nIt was not ok to be casually discussed. \n\nAnd it was hereditary. \ud83d\ude02", "Growing up all the adults in my family were larger (by larger i mean tall and squishy.) I thought i was normal. I remember when I was younger I met my friends mom for the first time and she was short and skinny and I yelled at my friend for lying to me because \"MOMS ARE SQUISHY STEPHANIE! SHE'S SMALL! SHE'S NOT YOUR MOM!\" \n\nI lie awake some nights still thinking about it.", "and also it seems like the only acceptable time to ask for an apology like that would\u2019ve been when it was said something as easy as \u201chey I know you might be nervous but that was a little bit disrespectful in our house we just try to speak to others a little kinder\u201d but definitely not a couple of months later when the girl probably doesn\u2019t even remember what she said. And op said it was an apology to be comfortable with the girls hanging out together but they\u2019ve been hanging out at school which is what the husband said so it seems like op just wants an apology for herself not her daughter", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t even phrase it like that. \n\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean it negatively, but when you said this it sounded to me like you were commenting on my weight.  Some people may take it as an insult, so be careful how you phrase things.\u201d", "And honestly insecure. Assuming the comment was an insult and then focusing on it for so long shows there is an insecurity there.", "Mauritania, but you probably wouldn\u2019t want to live there. Their beauty standard has people force-feeding their daughters to plump them up.", "Latinos love to fatten people up!", "I'm not so worried about OP still being bothered by the comment - it's only natural for things that bother us to do so for awhile.  There are things students said to/about me 20 years ago that still sometimes pop into my head and will make me feel self-conscious, even though those comments would be inaccurate now and have no bearing on my life. As soon as I remind myself \"that was a kid saying that, they've grown since then and so have I,\" I'm completely over it.", "Quiet chalk-hands!

Her mom remarried a few years later. I had met the new step-siblings, but had not seen the mom or met the new step-dad since they got married. I was maybe 13 when I saw the mom at a school function with the oldest step-brother and step-dad. Without thinking, I addressed her as Mrs. \"Ex.\" *In front of her new husband.* She very coldly replied, \"It's Mrs. 'Husband.'\" I could have sunk through the floor. I stammered out an apology and fled. \n\nIf she had continued to treat me with the same coldness for the rest of high school, it would have ruined my friendship with her daughter and I never would have become friends with the steps. She wasn't as warm to me after that as she had been before, but she never brought that up again and I was still welcome for sleep-overs and such.", "Oh god, I'm still mortified at the things I said 30 years ago. I feel so sorry for the poor girl. When I was a waitress I accidentally called a woman \"sir.\" She looked so mortified and hurt, and I just tried to play it off like I wasn't looking directly at her when I said it. I mean I apologize too but I was just trying to reassure her that she didn't look masculine. I mean she did but...", "Ugh some of the stuff I did as a kid (not even teenager yet) still haunts me and I'm almost 40. The one that repeats in my head a lot is the time I STUCK MY FINGER into my friend's grandmother's container of limberger cheese to try it, just because. I was maybe 9 or 10.
