{"id": 4074, "submission_id": "ze4qw3", "title": "AITA for banishing my teenage daughter's friend from our house because she made fun of my weight?", "selftext": "I (37f) have two kids with my husband (41m); a 14-year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son.\n\nOur daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.", "created_utc": 1670327919, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze4qw3/aita_for_banishing_my_teenage_daughters_friend/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think it was a genuine error of someone unfamiliar with you trying to complement your husband and accidentally offending you. She\u2019s 14 which I remember as a socially awkward and embarrassing time. You\u2019re allowed to be a bit hurt but, as long as it doesn\u2019t happen again, you should put it down to a one time slip up.", "YTA. Did it ever occur to you that the reason this girl and your daughter \u201cclicked\u201d as friends is that they\u2019re *both* socially awkward? \n\nShe\u2019s a 14 year old kid. Even with the best social skills, they often put their foot in their mouths. Let it go. Don\u2019t ruin your daughter\u2019s friendship because your ego was hurt by one off hand comment.", "YTA - she\u2019s a 14 year old girl. You are being a bully!!  \n\nIf your daughter is an introvert/socially awkward maybe the type of friends she attracts are that way too?\n\nWhat if some grown woman was demanding your child apologize to her for making a comment months ago (presumably a true observation) in exchange for being allowed to socially visit with her child?  \n\nThe tables are going to turn on your daughter because other parents won\u2019t want their child around you.", "If you wanted to choose this battle you had to do it then. Too late.", "YTA.\n\nIf 14 is old enough to apologize, 37 is old enough to communicate that at the time. You've taken an awkward moment that this girl probably wishes she could forget and made it into some huge issue. Have some grace, let it go, let her think it's forgotten. And let your daughter have a friend, ffs.", "YTA. You should have asked for an apology at the table. What she said was very rude, and I think she knew it as soon as it came out of her mouth, but she didn\u2019t know what to do to make it right. If you\u2019d said \u201cthat\u2019s was very rude, and I\u2019d like an apology\u201d she would have said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d right there, and while awkward, it would have been over. \n\nYou missed your teaching moment. Holding a grudge for months against a 14-year-old is silly, and you\u2019re punishing your daughter unfairly. Let the kid have a friend.", "You said yourself that she seemed to realize she'd messed up after she said it. The poor girl was probably mortified, especially if she's socially awkward. She wasn't trying to insult you. She's a teenager who said the wrong thing. \n\nIf she knows you're still holding a grudge and demanding an apology she will be too embarrassed to ever come back to your house. You are costing your daughter her only friend because you can't just be the adult in this situation. Get over it. YTA", "Yta. Be an adult and MOVE ON from a comment made in the past. Instead, PARENT the child if it happens again and make clear that future comments will not be appreciated. What you\u2019re doing now is just stopping to a low, juvenile level.", "I don't want to call you an A-Hole but at the same it was an over reaction. Sometimes kids will say dumb stuff when they feel under pressure or in a new situation, no matter how confident a teenager comes across there's always that sense of social awkwardness. \nBest bet would be to let it slide for now, if a similar situation reoccurs then just say that you don't appreciate comments like that because you find it insulting/uncomfortable. I doubt your daughter's new friend went out of her way to be unpleasant and was probably just trying to be \"grown up\" or \"funny\" or something. \nDon't let it bother you, it's great your daughter has made a friend and that should be the main thing of importance.", "YTA. Are you really this touchy about your weight that you\u2019re preventing your child from having friends? You say your daughter is socially awkward. Your description of how you interact with her and her friends is a massive clue as to why. She\u2019s likely not \u201csocially awkward\u201d at all and instead is constantly walking on eggshells so as to not upset anyone, as she has learned to do from you. One throwaway comment and you ban her friend from the home. She\u2019s not an \u201cintrovert\u201d, you\u2019ve taught her to be very wary of how she behaves so she keeps her self to herself. Your reactivity and insecurity is costing her her childhood. \n\nYour feelings about your body are yours to own.", "YTA. You said your daughter is socially awkward to the point of having her tested. Birds of a feather flock together. This girl absolutely did not mean to insult you. \n\nYou, as the adult, should have and could have used the opportunity to talk about appropriate comments and kindness but instead chose to ignore it. \n\nI think inviting her into your home is appropriate especially if this is your daughters only friend. If you feel so inclined, let her know how the comment upset you and moving forward you\u2019d appreciate if any jokes were made not involving anyone\u2019s weight in the house. A healthy boundary to set.", "As a bigger woman myself, YTA. Kids say dumb things. \n\nOnce a kid came up to me in the mall and said, \u201cEwwww, you\u2019re fat!\u201d  I responded, \u201cEwww, you have brown hair!\u201d\n\nShe ran off crying to her mother.", "YTA\n\nTeenagers say dumb things. And the time to correct it was in the moment.\n\nLet the faux pas slide, but if it happens again, explain why it isn't ok to joke like that with you.\n\nThis is your daughter's friendship, keep the peace.", "Yes, YTA. And I think I know at least part of the reason your daughter is an introvert.  This is a total overreaction on your part.  You have held onto this one comment for months?  It isn\u2019t even an for sure an insult.  Do you really think she was consciously thinking about how she could upset you and decided she would do so by saying you are bigger?  She pointed out something everyone can see - you\u2019re bigger.  And you took it in the harshest possible way.  You used the word banish.  Like a dark ages leave the village fend for yourself in the wild punishment.  You didn\u2019t just decline. You want her banished. \n\nI think you might be dumping years of frustration about being a bigger woman on a 14 year old girl, who, if she is friends with your daughter, might be a bit of an introvert and a little awkward herself, and probably doesn\u2019t have polished social skills you require.  I bet you  never had those perfect skills at her age either.  And I have no ides what you get out of it.  This isn\u2019t the 1700\u2019s, your honor has not been besmirched.  Let it go.  \n\nYou say you\u2019re happy your daughter has a friend. I don\u2019t buy it.  And I have news for you: no 14 year old *your daughter included* owns up to all their screw ups.  \n\nIn fact YOU don\u2019t own up to all of your screw ups.  How do I know? You\u2019re not doing it now.  Drop it and apologize before you lose your daughter.", "YTA - are you sure you are an adult?  Your kid who is socially awkward finally has a friend who is also socially awkward and you want to punish them both?", "YTA. It\u2019s been months, let it go. Not addressing it when it happened is your oversight, not your daughter\u2019s or even her friend\u2019s. She put her foot in her mouth, and holding onto it this long only makes you seem petty and insecure.", "YTA, not for wanting an apology, but for waiting until months after the fact. You should have corrected her at the dinner table, she would've apologized and it would be over. \n\nYou don't hold a grudge against a 14yr old for months and then expect them to 1) remember the situation or 2) feel remorse or learn anything from their actions. It's like when you have a toddler, you punish them quickly after the fact so they know what they've done was wrong and understand why they're being punished. I.e. \"that wasn't nice, \" \"I'm sorry\" and it's done.", "YTA kids say stupid stuff all the time and she was clearly embarrassed by it. You said yourself your daughter does not have alot of friends. Don't ruin her one friendship", "YTA. She's 14, your daughter's *only friend* and is clearly also socially awkward.  She made a gaff. It didn't sound like it was out of meanness - it was just a stupid thing to say that may have sounded funny in her own head but fell flat.   \n\nYou would have your daughter lose her only friend (which is what will happen if you push for an apology) just to get an apology from a 14 year old.  Let's be honest. You are not teaching her a lesson, you are out for revenge for a slight.  I hope it's worth the cost your daughter will pay.", "YTA and you already know it. 14 year olds are just awkward as fuck and your acting like she did something horrific", "YTA. Stop it.\n\nYou're the adult here; don't pick a fight with a 14 year old child. It's clear this kid didn't mean to upset you. Do you really want to sabotage your own child's friendships because of your ego? You don't 'need' an apology. You need to act like an adult and shake it off.", "YTA. A phony apology will make you happy? I\u2019ve seen people try to get teenagers to apologize. It does not end well.\n\nI suggest you find something else to focus your anger on. The comment happened months ago, let it go.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an AH. But maybe you don\u2019t have to be so hard on her. You can give her another chance and see how she acts from here on out. It could have just been a one time awkward joke that did not land as your husband pointed out, and it seemed that she did realise she messed it up then. Being an awkward teenager, she might have been embarrassed and didn\u2019t know how to act after that. If after giving her another chance and she repeatedly makes such insensitive remarks, then she definitely owes you an apology (or more). Besides, it\u2019s hard for your daughter to make a friend so maybe you can let this one slide.", "YTA. Move on. You are an adult. It wasn't even a hateful derogatory statement. If anything, women of all body types are being celebrated in the media lately and at her impressionable age it might have been a well-meant, positive comment. \n\nLet your insecurities go. She's a teenager, not some coworker, and possibly one of your daughter's only friends.", "If you had talked to the friend at the time (\u201cWe don\u2019t comment on people\u2019s weight like that in this house. It\u2019s pretty hurtful.\u201d) and she didn\u2019t apologize, you\u2019d be perfectly justified. \n\nHowever, expecting an apology months later when you didn\u2019t address the issue at the time is, frankly, petty. Teenagers are not the best at reading social cues and often blurt things out without thinking them through first. The adults are supposed to guide them into more thoughtful and considerate behavior. \n\nSo\u2026right now, YTA. Let your daughter bring her friend over and let this go. The next time the friend says something awkward, address it calmly at the time.", "YTA, that seems really thin skinned and narrow minded from an adult that got - probably more due to awkwardness rather than intention - by a 14-year old. You felt insulted, but you are also not willing to go to the one that insulted you and tell them but put pressure on your daughter.", "YTA. If you didn\u2019t address it at the time now is too late. If it happens again address it at the time and then move on.", "Bigger woman here. You're overreacting. Your daughter is socially awkward and so are her friends. I don't think she meant to insult you. She was just forgetting her filter. You can correct her on the spot and tell her what she should do to handle it next time. But don't cheat your daughter of this friendship. YTA", "YTA\nShe is just a kid who said something dumb. She wasnt trying to insult you. One of you is going to have to be the grownup here, why should it have to be the child?", "NTA, but also kind of YTA for different reasons.\n\nNTA for expecting an apology. She's 14, not 4, it's not beyond her skill set as a teenager to simply apologize nor is it asking for much. If she knows her \"please's\" and \"thank you's\" then she also knows how to say sorry. Ik she was likely too ashamed to say anything after the joke, but she could have come to you later or the next day and said it then. \n\nHowever, the fact this happened months ago and it's fresh in your head is somewhat childish. You know it was a *really* bad joke, but you've clearly taken it as a personal slight against you. Your daughter is awkward, so the friends she makes are likely to be similar, her socialising skills aren't going to be great and she was likely nervous as all hell meeting what could be one of her only friends parents.", "YTA here. \n\nIf you feel it necessary, you _could_ say to your daughter\u2019s hard-earned friend, \u201cHey FRIEND, I want to let you know that what you said at dinner the last time you were here really hurt my feelings, and it\u2019s stuck with me. I hope in future you\u2019ll consider what impact your words might have on those who hear them so that you don\u2019t end up hurting people who are being nice to you.\u201d \n\nThis might make it a moment where an adolescent learns a little about being a grownup and about how to walk through the world. \n\nYour choice here is just going to further isolate a young woman who by your own description is already somewhat isolated. \n\nThink about it. Please.", "YTA if you were so offended you should have addressed it then, when the kid was *spending the night* not months later. Also you are an adult holding a grudge against a teenager who made an off hand comment, but you in no way attempted to use this as an opportunity to teach her (and your daughter) that comments like that are unintentionally hurtful.", "YTA. \n\nNot sure why you couldn't have just used that moment as a teaching moment. The kid is 14. It may have been a ill-planned joke, but I don't think it was meant to be malicious. \n\nJust politely tell the kid that's inappropriate & was uncalled for. Then move on. If the kid can't move past that, then sure, stronger measures need to be taken. If the kid never does it again tho, haven't they learned?\n\nEdit to add: I get being concerned that the people your kids hang out with are good people. As a mom, I worry about that too. \n\nForcing an apology when you hardly know the kid yet *and* when the kid already seems remorseful...who does that help? Not them, not your kid. It helps *you.* \n\nYou say your kid has struggled making friends, and now they've made one. Is this apology important enough to cause that friendship to end? \n\nYour kid is right. This was *months* ago. It won't do any good to bring it up again.", "YTA. You should have asked for an apology at the time or let it go. What the kid said wasn't even rude - inappropriate perhaps, but that's kids for you, especially socially awkward ones. If you're big, own it - don't hold a grudge against some kid because you're upset about your weight.", "Insisting on an apology isn\u2019t a big deal and is appropriate.  NTA", "None of the response labels quite fit, it\u2019s a combo of ESH and YTA.\n\nThe kid misspoke and said something rude. She should have apologized, but I bet her introverted ass felt too awkward to speak. You\u2019re NTA for being hurt by this, but if you were going to demand an apology, it should have been immediately after. From everyone else\u2019s POV, you dropped it for weeks/months and are now dragging it back out. This looks petty to them. I\u2019m sure your daughter is interpreting it as you being petty to mess with her, that\u2019s how teenage girls think.\n\nYou have the right to be upset by this, but do you want to torpedo your daughter\u2019s friendship over something so silly? Being a parent means putting our kids first. Even when our pride is hurt, even when we don\u2019t want to. Even when it\u2019s hard. \n\nInvite the kid over and chat with her if you must. But be an adult. This \u201cshe can\u2019t come over until she does this arbitrary thing\u201d stuff needs to go. Just because you have the right to do crap like this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s healthy, helpful to the situation, or the best thing for your kiddo.", "What if that friend IS on the spectrum? And that\u2019s why she missed a cue and said something  unintentionally offensive. \n\nI understand your position but I actually think you need to give her another chance. And maybe this is the stuff that causes your daughter to be more introverted. She might be terrified of saying something wrong or offensive to someone so she keeps to herself. \n\nSoft YTA.  Give the friend another chance.", "YTA. Have you thought that your daughter's friend might  also be socially awkward? She's 14yo and she realized she Fu***d up. Do you think she has the social experience of an adult to have handled the situation right in that moment? Let the girl go back to your house and see if those \"jokes\" are a bad attitude or just a mistake. \nI understand that body-shaming is bad, but come on. Suck it up and see.", "Are you really going to prevent your daughter from having this one single friend because she called you fat? Is this the hill you wanna die on?....I'm also really introverted and can confidently tell you that this will prevent your daughter from having the courage to make other friends because this is how you react to kids trying to make a joke. Their brains are still developing and sometimes they can't control what just comes out of their mouths.", "YTA. It doesn\u2019t sound like your daughters friend intentionally insulted you. You should be able to let it go and move on. If you absolutely have to you could calmly and reasonably explain to her when she comes over next that what she said hurt your feelings and give a gentle reminder that words hurt and be careful what you say to people. Absolutely do not banish her from the house because of a simple mistake. That will hurt your daughter and is completely uncalled for. Don\u2019t pretend you didn\u2019t say something stupid when you were 14, we all did.", "YTA only because it's been a couple months. You need to address these issues when they happen, with words, not months later, with a cold shoulder and a grudge. You could have even told her parents what she said if you didn't feel comfortable parenting their daughter, but that's not your issue here, because you clearly say that you're trying to teach her a lesson. All you're teaching her, and your own daughter and husband, is that you're petty and you hold grudges against children.", "YTA. Agreed with everyone that it should have been handled in the moment. Also, part of being an adult is having a CONVERSATION if someone hurts your feelings, not just expecting them to immediately know what they did wrong and apologize, especially if the other person is a literal child. I think it\u2019s totally appropriate to have a QUICK conversation about it, say the comment hurt your feelings but you know she didn\u2019t mean to and you forgive her, but that words have power to hurt people. Then be done with it and MOVE ON.", "YTA - the kid was being an awkward kid.  Get over it.", "ESH\nHonestly this girl sounds a bit like me. When I was younger I would try hard to give a genuine compliment, but unintentionally say something borderline offensive. It's quite mortifying to think of it now, but back then I thought I was being nice.\n\nI don't think it's wrong of you to explain why is it not okay and ask for apology. This will help her grow. However I think you missed your timing. This should have been addressed there and then. Now you just look petty.", "YTA. Teens get flustered and say stupid things. I remember my friend in high school attended a funeral and got so nervous when in the family receiving online that she accidentally said \u201ccongratulations\u201d instead of expressing her sympathies. Your daughter\u2019s friend was so focused on complimenting the cook that she put her foot in her mouth with you. Be gracious and move on. If it happens again then perhaps reevaluate.", "YTA. Your daughters friend isn\u2019t responsible for all the worlds slights against you, or for every time a mean spirited comment was made towards you. Was it insensitive? Yes, but the friend may be just as \u201csocially awkward\u201d as your daughter and didn\u2019t know how to react after she realized she had insulted you. It\u2019s been months. It\u2019s fine to gently tell the girl she hurt your feelings, but it is absolutely not okay to banish your daughters friend because she accidentally offended you. It\u2019s also weird to hold a grudge against a 14 year old instead of addressing the problem when it happened.", "YTA. A demanded apology is a fake apology. This is a 14 year old child who may have been nervous and blurted out a thoughtless remark. Besides, if you are a \"bigger\" woman, then it was a factual statement and she sees nothing wrong with a person being heavy. It's not her fault you're sensitive about it.", "YTA, she was insensitive, but it is rather odd to be holding a grudge against a kid. She most likely knows that she's wrong, and if she says something like that again you can just correct her. Don't get in the way of your child's positive friendships.", "NTA\n\nThat being said, I do think that you should have spoken up, and said something to this girl as soon as she said what she said. I think that 14 years old is old enough to realize/know that you shouldn't call someone fat, or say that they're \"a bigger woman\" because their husband/spouse is a good cook.", "YTA I had to reread to check how old you are, this is so ridiculously childish not to mention immature. Grow up.", "YTA. It *is* weird to demand an apology from a 14 year old child over a joke, albeit a joke that lacked taste. She\u2019s a kid, you\u2019re an almost 40 year old adult. It\u2019s very strange that you\u2019re not able to move past a child\u2019s bad taste humor months after the fact.", "Wow you\u2019re holding a grudge against a 14 year old?? Do you hear yourself. She made a off the cuff remark, she\u2019s a child. It obviously struck you to your core but you\u2019re blowing it out of proportion. I\u2019d say grow up but we already see you how take those things YTA", "Of course YTA she didn't even call you fat, she called you a \"larger woman\". You feel fat that's why you felt offended. You seem to be very insecure about your weight but clearly not as much to do something about it. She's 14, kids at that age are not always politically correct and say things as they see them.", "Yta. You're projecting your insecurities about your weight onto a 14yr old who probably felt awkward as hell, who tried to make a joke and who got it wrong. Who hasnt, I'm 30 and still say the wrong thing when my anxiety is really bad. I know to say sorry now, but at 14 that would have been the most terrifying scary thing. \nLet it go. For the sake of your daughter having her first friend. Do you really want to be responsible for ruining her first proper friendship because a 14yr old said the wrong thing. She will grow up and probably think about it a lot and feel sorry!", "Unpopular but NTA. At 14, you're old enough to know when something you say is hurtful and that you should apologize for it. You arent telling your daughter that they can't be friends, just that she needs to apologize before she's welcome to stay the night at your house.", "YTA, she\u2019s a child and probably didn\u2019t even mean it as a joke but just said something as she saw it and realized immediately afterwards she had accidentally been rude. You could pull her aside quietly and say it hurt your feelings, some people feel bad about being bigger so you need to be careful, but that you are happy she\u2019s friends with her daughter. She will ACTUALLY learn something about hurting people then.", "YTA. You\u2019re taking your hurt feelings out on your daughter. You said your daughter is \u201csocially awkward\u201d did you ever consider that her friend might be too? If she seemed to realize her misstep then she was probably embarrassed and being 14 didn\u2019t know how to handle it", "YTA\n\nYou don't have to like all your daughters friends and it sounds like she wasn't necessarily trying to be rude to you but complimenting your husband and it came out wrong. \n\nBeing called fat isn't an insult when it's a fact, source: fellow fat woman. If you don't like it then start working on losing weight. Also curious if she's fat as well because she may feel as I do about that not being a big deal. \n\nAnd this is her only friend? It's been 2 months, get over it.\n\nUnless she's starts making overtly insulting comments to you, then consider what happened a misunderstanding\n\nAlso - the time to address this was at the moment, not 2 months later.", "YTA. She was clearly giving you a compliment that she worded poorly because she\u2019s probably as awkward of a teen as your daughter. It\u2019s a shame as a grown adult that a 14 year old girl can still get under your skin. \n\nIf it was a problem you should address it immediately. You let it go so did everyone else.", "She didn\u2019t even make fun of you though? You\u2019re behaving like a teenager in all of this as well instead of as the adult who has experience with socially awkward teenagers who clearly meant no harm. YTA", "YTA\n\n\nIf you had an issue, you should've brought it up at the time. \n\n\nShe wasn't being derogatory, she wasn't making fun of your weight. She made a comment as a teenager that i very much doubt she'll say again, and obviously felt really awkward about it. \n\n\nIf she does bring it up again, I'd calmly tell her that commenting on someone's body is unnecessary and can be very hurtful, so she should try to refrain from doing so in future.

We have two kids; a 14-year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son.\n\nOur daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.\n\nHowever, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.\n\nSo, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; \"Are you enjoying the food?\" She responded \"Yes! \\[Your husband\\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.\"\n\nThe room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.\n\nThis was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her \"Sure; if she's going to apologize to me.\" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.\n\nShe then went to her father and asked. He said \"sure\" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: \"\\[Daughter's friend\\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?\"\n\nYes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and mey daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

This friendship sounds like an important step for your daughter. \n\nHowever, should the friend say something awkwardly rude again take the opportunity to kindly point it out, and make it a teachable moment.

You're older than my DAD.\" I immediately kinda cringed inside. Because dang, child. I'm not ashamed of my age or my looks or anything but she made me feel like I had to be closing in on 90.

(Now, I would appreciate a calm heads-up from an adult who witnessed it so I could walk him through a better approach, but not that he be cut off from friends over it.)", "YTA if your daughter is normally a loner it\u2019s likely her new friend is too, meaning she probably has less practice socializing than the average 14 year old.\nAlso, she\u2019s a kid! She was likely feeling nervous in a new friends home for the first time.\nFinally, she didn\u2019t mock you, she stated a fact. She may be insecure about her own size, most teens are, and this is a time you can re-assure her that it\u2019s ok to be yourself!", "YTA- I agree with everyone else saying YTA. I understand this hurt your feelings, BUT I wonder if your daughter's friend might be on the spectrum. My friends daughter is on the spectrum & I remember when she was younger, it was hard for her to understand why the truth is hurtful.  This means that if you are on the bigger side like I was, then the girl may have said this, then realized in the moment she might have said something wrong but didn't know how to handle it afterward. Seems to me you are making a mountain out of a mole hill. If your daughter struggles to make friends give it a chance to see if something like this happens again & if it does ask the mother if the daughter is on the spectrum try to be understanding & let her mother handleit & if not explain what has happened ONLY if something else is said or happens.", "Soft YTA\u2026 she\u2019s 14. She may not realize how hurt you were by that comment. Teenagers say dumb things all the time. The way they learn is by us adults correcting them and showing them what\u2019s acceptable. She very likely did not go home and tell her folks what she said. And because you didn\u2019t immediately say anything (hey that\u2019s a rude thing to say) she probably felt a little embarrassed but then because she wasn\u2019t corrected she brushed it off like it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Get over yourself, invite her over, make some tea or hot chocolate and tell her that last time she was over she said something hurtful and you\u2019d appreciate if she could keep comments about weight to herself. Or anything else that resembles adult behavior to a child.", "YTA. You're the adult, so you're the one who has to help children learn. In the moment, if you felt hurt, it would be your job to say: \"Daughter's friend - while I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt my feelings, it's generally rude to comment on the size of anyone's body. We never know what someone is going through or why their body looks the way it does, so it's better not to speculate.\" This might have even opened up a conversation! Instead, you decided to stew in awkward silence and cling to this memory for months.", "I feel like your socially awkward kid made a socially awkward friend. You could have said something at the time but hold a grudge against a kid like that seems weird to me. YTA", "I\u2019m going to hell because I laughed a little bit \ud83d\ude4a", "YTA, but not for expecting an apology.\n\nYou're expecting a 14 yearly old that clearly noticed she messed up and shut her mouth in embarrassment to use her words an apologize but you can't use your words and say to her \"kiddo, you might not have meant to cause harm, but what you said hurt my feelings and it's never ok to joke about someone's weight if you don't have their consent.  But on top of that,when you clearly notice that you have said something inappropriate, it's important to own that and apologize, not pretend it didn't happen. Even if owning it and apologizing is awkward and uncomfortable\" I'm going to guess that if you did this the next time she came over she WOULD apologize.  I absolutely think a 14 year old can and should learn those types of manners, but kids screw up and they need to learn. So be the adult and use it as a teaching moment. And maybe learn a thing or 2 yourself about using your words if you expect others to do the same.", "Soft YTA. One, holding a grudge against a teenager is just immature. We all said incredibly hurtful things to others unintentionally at that age. Even as adults we still require others to use their worlds when something upsets them. Two, you\u2019re a grown woman who should be able to initiate a conversation on your feelings with literally anyone. Set the example. Let her know that weight is not something you appreciate being joked about in your home. You need to be the one to set boundaries in your own household. If you want people to just know your boundaries before entering your home put a pamphlet on the porch\u2026\n\n***Not all introverts are socially awkward, they just accumulate energy not being surrounded by people. Not synonymous.", "YTA, they are 14 and lack maturity, and the father of the friend has a point!", "If this is the only thing she said and she acted super akward when she realised what she said I would let it go. Sure it isn't fun to hear but I was the same kind of weird child who would blurt out stuff ( I still am this way as an adult ). Your daughter needs a friend and if she isn't a bad influence I would just let it go.", "NTA. If she\u2019s old enough to level an insult she\u2019s old enough to own and apologize. \n\nYou\u2019re not obligated to have some who insulted you in your home.", "This.", "This.

The time to address her comment was at the time it was said.  A gentle comment in the moment and move on.  Sounds like the girl simply spoke before thinking and realized what she said after she said it.\n\nFor the sake of your kid, find your inner Elsa and let it go.", "This is so true. OP, I agree it was a rude comment. But you didnt say anything when it happened, so it is now water under the bridge. Let it go. \n\nLet your daughter have her ONE FRIEND and dont mess this up for her. This is way more important than your hurt feelings. You are a grow woman. Act like it. \n\nIf the friend is rude again, correct her gently in the moment, or not at all.", "This! She didn\u2019t know how to make it right! Her husband laughed off the joke at the time so how was she supposed to know she had upset the mum so much?", "Exactly this. We live in a fatphobic society, she's certainly internalized that, but it doesn't sound like she was trying to be offensive. Her own mom or dad might say they're bigger because of the other spouse's cooking or constantly remind her daughter about food habits. She could be on the spectrum or also be socially awkward, who knows. \n\nIf she was regularly rude, then that's something to bring up with her or her parents, but at this point, this feels like trying to parent someone else's kid or punishing your own.", "Yes to correcting it into the moment! Not harboring resentment towards a teenager for months", "Agreed. This is exactly what I wanted to say.", "This.  Exactly.", "I agree. To me, it seems like she was trying to make a light-hearted joke and after saying the words out loud she realized she said something mean. But it doesn't sound like it was with ill intent. Idk, maybe I'm being too optimistic or something\n\nAt the same time I don't think it's wrong for OP to be hurt by something hurtful that was said to her, even if the kid didn't have malicious intent", "Agreed. If, in the moment it happened, OP had said \"I don't appreciate comments about my weight, thank you...\" I'm sure the girl would have backpedalled and apologized immediately and then everyone would have laughed it off and moved on.

By staying silent she accepted the situation, she could have pulled the girls aside later and talked about it gently but she didn't. YTA", "I agree but will say we don't even know it was meant to even be a joke. I have a feeling this kid is as awkward as OPs and didn't realize it came out the way it did until said. Hence, the immediate understanding afterward. But I could be wrong and it was ill planned. Either way, as the adult, OP should have used her words right from the start. The time has passed for demanding anything. Get over your hurt feelings from months ago or make your child ditch her friend . This kid won't apologize, and even if they did, what an unnecessary situation to embarass your child over. I'd be mortified if my mother did it.", "Friend didn\u2019t come from a malicious place and I\u2019m sure that being called \u201cbigger\u201d is one of those things that not everyone gets offended by.  Is like when people ask me where I\u2019m from . A lot of people get offended by it but I just look at from a point of view of curiosity.\n\nIf it\u2019s not a big deal, she should let it go (unless her ego is more important that her daughters relationship)", "I honestly don't get this POV. \n\nThis girl made a joke that was shitty.  All the mom is asking is for an apology for insulting her in her own home.  That really isn't that big of an ask.", "There are times I feel like I\u2019m taking crazy pills on Reddit, and this is one of them.

You\u2019re holding onto this for so long \u2026 a 14-y/o is getting under your skin and you\u2019ve held onto it for months.

Kids say weird things and holding a grudge against a 14 year old, as an adult, is very telling of OPs emotional maturity.", "Agree.\n\nThis is a teachable moment. For a lot of kids that age they don't realise even what they feel are harmless \"jokes\" or backhanded compliments can be harmful/hurt.\n\nI personally wouldn't ban them or demand an apology, but each to their own and I can understand if someone else would because unsolicited weight/body comments in ones own house can be tough.  \nI'd have a conversation with the friends parent(s) about the comment, and also your own child about how comments about other people's bodies (even if they don't mean to be rude), can hurt and can be harmful and just to be more mindful of others.\n\nI can understand if the kid felt, I guess, intimidated being that was the first time meeting both parents?
