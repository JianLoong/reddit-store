I care about Eric a lot. I love him as my little brother, and one of my closest friends. While we have been stepbrothers for about 17 years, we really have gotten closer over the last 5. About 5 years ago Eric let me know that my actions were making him feel like less of a brother, and that he didn't matter as much as my bio sisters. That was hard to hear, but I've worked to fix that, so that he knows he matters to me.\n\nWhen Eric first asked if I would go on his bachelor's trip I immediately said yes, because of course I want to be there with my brother. However, Eric is really an outdoorsy person, and I now understand that for bachelor party he wants to go camping with a group of friends. He wants to do some outdoors shit like hiking, maybe white rafting or canoeing or something like that, sleeping in tents etc.\n\nThe problem is I am very much overweight (but making steady progress to be less so, for the first sustained length of time!!). harsh truth, I just started being able to put one foot in front of the other taking stairs, instead of having to go one stair at a time, if that makes sense. I'm not someone who should be hiking yet, not quite built for navigating rocks and boulders and the like. Even though I am losing weight, I do find this somewhere embarrassing not to be able to do these things - and like the thought of risking a kayak rental not having a life vest my size is not fun. or rolling an ankle on hike and then someone having to help me return to camp.\n\nI told my brother I can't go for these reasons, he's upset since I originally told him I would be down for whatever (I just didn't imagine forever meant this!). he really, really wants me there. me being present with him is important to him. my brother has said I'm not valuing our relationships and I good big brother would be willing to do this to spend such an important week together.\n\nAITA for backing out of going on this bachelor's trip?", "created_utc": 1678365471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mr4cx/aita_for_not_going_on_my_stepbrothers_bachelor/", "score": 309, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I did not back out for financial reasons or anything like that, but because I am overweight and camping as an overweight person sounds not great. it's (hopefully) my brother's only bachelor party ever in life, and I know it would mean a lot to him to be there. pulling out is upsetting him - when I could just stay at camp and read a book when they go hiking or whatever\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

They are doing activities that are physically hard for you to do and he should be more understanding of your limitations. Your are under no obligation to put your health at risk just to make him feel better. He is being immature.\n\nOffer to participate by planning a kick-off event the night before they leave, and/or a welcome back event when they return. \n(edited to make more clear)", "NTA. Your reasons being that of health are pretty valid, and your brother should understand that. Try to look for compromises if possible, but all you can do is explain your reality and hope he understands.", "NTA and Eric sounds really emotionally manipulative.  Does it seem like he uses \"you don't value our relationship\" as a way to control your behavior?  \n\nIf you can't physically keep up, you are going to have a miserable weekend and probably make it harder for the others on the trip as well.  It's odd that Eric wants you to be in an uncomfortable situation just to prove your commitment. He seems more concerned about you proving our feelings for him rather than your comfort or happiness.", "NTA.  If you can not participate safely because of your size you are putting yourself and others at risk. Several people mentioned you going to hand out at the campsite.   This is a option and you should offer if the campsite is not one you have to hike to.", "NAH\n\nTrip hasn't happened. I don't see why you couldn't show up for a night or two and hang around the camp site. Set realistic expectations for yourself. Pulling up to a site in a car and sleeping in a tent should be alright to do. All other events just hang back at camp.\n\n\nIf that's not possible, it is understandable to exclude yourself for the reasons above. Mind you lots of overweight people do go camping just fine. Your comfort does matter though. Eric just wants you there and is hurt. So give him some time.", "NTA - SO SO SO not the AH. Your brother should get to do whatever activities he wants for his bachelor party trip. But he needs to understand that if those activities are not inclusive, not everyone will be able to participate. If your presence is so important to him, then he should have chosen activities that are accessible for you. \n\nAlso, I call BS on him saying a \"good big brother\" would be willing to do this. You are both adults and not all that far apart in age. He is just as accountable for being a \"good brother\" as you are. He is being selfish and manipulative. \n\nNot to mention - expecting people to go on a WEEK LONG bachelor trip is beyond entitled. Not everyone wants to use that much of their vacation time/be away from their own lives that long to celebrate someone else. And asking people who have never been camping/are not experienced campers to go camping for a WEEK is a huge ask.", "NAH, your cutting yourself short.  You can go and be present, but you can also not participate in activities that your unable to do safely.  He seems to just want you there.  Set your boundaries on those things, but surely you can hang around the campfire and enjoy that moment.  I hope you reconsider and are able to attend for both your sakes.", "Nta!! Great work getting healthy. And hopefully he will see reason", "This is a perfect opportunity to compromise. You both want/need something different. Find a mutually agreeable solution. It doesn\u2019t have to be all or nothing. Work together to figure out a plan that makes you both happy. \n\nNAH", "NTA. OP's brother must know OP is overweight and not physically capable of the things he wants OP to do. Why did he set up the trip this way? Is he trying to shame OP? Some stupid joke? The brother's motivations concern me.", "Find out *where* your little brothers trip will be. Details are important. Maybe they will be near civilization, not way off grid, and you can drive to the campsite. There might be showers and electricity, the camping part might not be that bad. You could participate, at least in a inlimited way.\n\nThey make life vests for *big* guys. I bought one for my husband.\n\nBut if you just can\u2019t do it, then you can\u2019t do it. Your brother will have to understand that and get over it. NTA", "NTA - as someone with an invisible disability, I also cannot do the things you outline here. The key is my siblings know this and would not book this type of trip if they wanted me there. Which is not to say your s-bro is an AH, not at all, but he should understand your discomfort and not emotionally manipulate you into doing something that would be embarrassing or dangerous for you. \n\nCan you recommend that he also hold another get together, maybe even one you host in his honor? A nice dinner party or evening out? Don't call it his bachelor's party but make it all about him?\n\nI agree with others that maybe there are ways you could go on this trip and make it work, but I also take you at your word when you say this would put you in discomfort. If there is no way to make it work and keep you comfortable and safe, then I'd look at the option above. \n\nI am not going to call your s-bro abelist, but I have been told on more than one occasion that I \"should\" be able to do something that I know will flare up my condition because I \"love\" that person, and it's really disheartening to hear it. Good luck with the weight loss and good on you for working towards a healthier future!", "NTA. Would you feel comfortable going on the trip and taking care of the camp while everyone else is off rafting, hiking and related? That way you get some of the camaraderie but don't break an ankle of get washed downstream. Just a  thought, see how Brother feels about this.", "NTA", "I don't think \"asshole\" is the term I'd use, but I think you might be making a mistake - \n\nYou sound a bit down on  yourself, anxious that you would be in the way or somehow bring down the mood. I think that's completely misplaced - he clearly wants you there, and trust me, no bachelor party trip is about the hiking/rafting/kayaking parts, it's about being together with friends and close family.\n\nBy all means, stick to your boundaries when it comes to a serious hike or trying to wedge yourself into a kayak or whatever, but you might want to go anyway and do the lighter activities (and especially the hanging out by the campfire type stuff).\n\nYour choice, obviously, but it might just be what you need, and it's definitely what your stepbrother wants.", "NAH. You are totally within your right to decide that the trip and the activities are not suited for you. It\u2019s also understandable that Eric would be upset at this news since you originally told him that you\u2019d be fine with whatever kind of trip he wanted. \n\nI feel like a good way to resolve this would be to plan some kind of weekend trip for just you two to celebrate his new marriage. You can plan for activities you know you both like and are able to do and he will feel like he does matter to you since you went out of your way to do something to make up for it.", "NAH - Speak to him about your limitations and how you feel about the activities. Maybe he will accommodate you to some extent if he understands your concerns. I wouldn't approach it from saying you are going to back out entirely just voice what you did here.", "I want to say, I feel like this is the type of question this sub was made for.  \n\nRight now, I'm going to say NAH... yet.  \n\nI totally get your POV.  You wouldn't be able to do everything, and don't want to be embarassed not being able to do other things. \n\nAt the same time, I get where he is coming from.  You agreed, essentially sight unseen, to go on this trip.  You spent 5 years working on your relationship and this is something super important for him.  And you are backing out.  That would be hurtful.   And he has the right to be upset.  \n\nI'd try to figure out if there is any kind of compromise to be had.  Maybe if its a weekend thing, they can do the hikes and canoeing one day, and you can either come late or leave early.  I think even if you didn't go the entire time, that might make him feel better that you made an effort to be there.", "NAH, but could you go along for part of the time? Stay off the hiking and white water activities, and hang out with your little brother and his friends in the evening round the camp fire?", "Soft YTA.\n\nI completely understand your concerns and insecurities about going on the trip.\n\nI think since you agreed to go originally, it would make you the asshole. Is there not a way for you to go, but only participate in what activities you feel like you can? \n\nI know that might mean a lot of activities you sit out of, but I think it\u2019s just the premise of being there. Hopefully there\u2019s still so much time spent at the camp grounds itself and doing other things as a group that it doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re just chilling doing nothing all day, while everyone else has fun. I think if you could compromise with him and say \u2018I\u2019m down to go, but will you understand if I sit out of some activities?\u2019 he\u2019d understand. Maybe even be honest with him about your concerns on what you can/can\u2019t do. Maybe him/the others won\u2019t mind doing a smaller paced hike or trail with you. Maybe there\u2019s activities he can plan that are size inclusive like just swimming or something else. I know you don\u2019t want him to switch his party around for you, but if he wants you there maybe he will either make some adjustments or be okay with you sitting out of a few activities, but being there for the other activities/experience/time spent together.", "NAH but what if you went along and gave it a try? Worst case, you need a rest after two minutes of hiking or there\u2019s not proper outfitting for a day kayak outing, and you return to rest at camp for the day. The group can meet you back at camp after hiking-kayaking-outing. Is this a possibility? Do you have to miss out on the whole thing?", "NTA He\u2019s being manipulative. If you physically can\u2019t do it then you can\u2019t. It has nothing to do with how much you love him.\n\n\u201cA good little brother wouldn\u2019t have picked something I can\u2019t participate in and then treat me like shit when I can\u2019t go.\u201d  But I\u2019m a petty bitch.", "Soft YTA. \n\nYou don't have to do all the activities planned and everybody will understand.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don\u2019t risk your health for his controlling ways.", "NAH. \n\nEric is so caught up in the idea of having you, one of the most important people in his life, at his bachelor party that he\u2019s forgetting that you *can\u2019t* do certain things (as opposed to just not wanting to). The reality of the situation is that you can\u2019t go unless you\u2019re willing to risk jeopardizing your health, and Eric shouldn\u2019t ask you to do that. I wouldn\u2019t just let this go, though. Give Eric a tiny bit of time for a cooler head, and then ask him if there\u2019s any way you can switch a day or two to activities you\u2019re capable of doing. Maybe y\u2019all can do a pleasure cruise on a rented boat instead of kayaking, or maybe he\u2019s willing to spend a day drinking and celebrating at a campsite rather than hiking.

One of them actually used his words, like an adult should, to discuss how he felt, and the other person made changes to make them feel better.  \n\nPeople have the right to have hurt feelings and express that without it being manipulative.", "100% do not think he's trying to shame or play a joke on me. i do not think he's being nefarious in anyway at all. i just think he wants me there with me, its a big occasion for him.", "The brother is probably doing what he would want to do for his bachelor party and didn't really think about the brother.  I think for a bachelor party, you have the right to be a bit selfish. \n\nThat said, I also think knowing he is overweight doesn't necessarily mean he can't do certain things.  I've been on hikes and seen plenty of overweight people.  It would also be presumptious to assume what OP can and can't do", "yeah, bringing down the mood is one of my concerns. if i go, and then i dont do something - like go on some hike or whatever - i dont want someone else to feel bad and then feel like they have to stay behind with me, and then next thing you know we're splitting groups up. i also don't want for eric to change any plans for me. he's got a list of things he wants to do, and so i want him to do them!", "this exactly, if you're worried you could reduce the experience, don't. he's said explicitly he wants you to be there. he's annoyed that you're considering backing out. you should do it. it'd be good exercise, you might find a new hobby and you might get some new friends that'll last a life time.", "What about OPs need to also be supported by his brother? He\u2019s not blowing the party off for a stupid reason and he deserves the same kindness he\u2019s trying to show his brother.", "i probably wouldnt mind staying at the camp, but i dont want other people to feel guilty about me staying there and then also decide to stay, and then suddenly we're in two groups. my brother deserves to do the things he has planned", "I think it depends a lot on campsite location and conditions. If the plan is to drag OP into the woods and leave him there twiddling his thumbs by himself, holding his phone to the sky trying to get one bar every day while the rest of the boys go adventuring, it\u2019s rude to demand that as a sign of OP\u2019s love and affection. If the camp site\u2019s a 15 minute drive from town and right next to a road, I think maybe your comment is more applicable.", "he's usually not manipulative, i feel like i should note that. he's a great guy, i love spending time with him, he means the world to me.", "I didn't say anything about abuse but when someone offers a valid excuse not to attend something and the other person claims that not attending = not valuing the relationship, that's manipulative.

Its not about OP, its about his brother.  People have the right to be hurt by things.  It didn't sound like the brother is like disowning him, just telling him that he is hurt. \n\nI swear, people are talking out their feelings like adults, and people still want someone to be a bad guy.  \n\nI didn't say OP was wrong, but that doesn't mean the brother can't have and express his feelings for a party that is FOR him", "I'd either go but explain I'm not healthy enough for the activities or offer to take them for a meal after their camping trip to make up for it then if this is a one-off reaction", "Ha.

Its ridiculous", "Again, I think people are ok to have their feelings hurt when someone backs out on something they agreed to, even if the reason is valid. \n\nA couple years ago, for a big birthday, I had a little road trip planned.  I had 3 of my good friends who agreed to go back out, all within a couple of days of each other.   Their reasons all made sense.

I'm an outdoorsy person, and I have some good friends who are in similar shoes to you. You'll find almost everyone is totally fine if you let other people do what they want, and you do what you can. Obviously don't expect a large group of other people accommodate to you, but you should feel free to accommodate for yourself. If you pull up to a campsite in a car, and politely decline the hike and canoe portion, you'll probably find that step bro is happy to see you and will totally understand your limitations. There's a difference between putting in the effort you can, and showing you care by being there, and participating fully in everything. I had a friend come on a canoe trip with a trawling motor and a car battery, and he left a day early. It was hilarious, but I was so glad he came.\n\nAlso, congrats on the steady progress in your weight loss. I've been there. It's hard but worth it to put in the effort. It gets easier every day, but that's the thing,.... you have to do a little every day.", "NTA. Tell him you are an idiot for not knowing that when he said bachelor party, he wasn\u2019t talking trip to vegas, he was talking about a camping trip, not a bachelor party. Truth is: A camping trip is not a bachelor party. It\u2019s a camping trip to celebrate his upcoming nuptials. A bachelor party is a one night event, usually at a venue like a bar or strip club, involves drinking, eating, possibly singing and strippers or a performance of some kind. A camping trip as your bachelor party is NOT typical, clearly not expected, and something you personally can\u2019t do. People can be so selfish about weddings. He is TA.  Not you. He should\u2019ve accepted your change of heart with grace.", "NTA you\u2019re not backing out because you don\u2019t wanna go. It\u2019s because you can\u2019t go. Answer this: if you went, slowed everyone down considerably, got injured and made everyone else deal with it, what\u2019s he gonna say? Is he gonna say you don\u2019t care as much because you made it about you? Even though you didn\u2019t and even tried to be reasonable? Seems like a no win situation to me. Maybe offer to meet them for a day on the town or dinner or something but don\u2019t risk your life just to please him.", "NTA - But I do have a compromise that might work for you. Buy a camp cot with a memory foam matress on it. It sucks sleeping on the ground, this will give you a fairly comfortable bed that you can get in and out of much more easily. Another option is to arrange for an RV to be delivered to the campsite as a rental. \n\nNext, be the designated driver for the activities. You can drop them off at the trail head, or the white water rafting, and pick them up and drive them to the bar for a few beers before heading back to the camp site. You\u2019ll be there for the party, you will be there for the campfire stories, and you will contribute in a meaningful way.\n\nOn a side note, as someone that has lost nearly 100 lbs after a very near death experience, keep putting one foot in front of the other. The change in quality of life is worth it. You\u2019re worth it.", "NTA. It's literally not safe for you to do this kind of trip. I have recently watched a few videos on bad things happening to people on hikes and whitewater trips, which inherently have some risk involved, and that was without weight and not being in shape as a factor. It only takes a couple things going wrong for someone to get seriously injured or even die. \n\nI don't know if you'll be able to make him understand that being realistic about your limitations doesn't mean you don't value him as a brother. That sounds like a really deep insecurity on his part, and you are probably not the right person to try to fix that. Maybe if you explained to him that there is a serious risk of you getting injured if you try to do these things that are beyond your ability, that might not only ruin the trip for everyone, but then you might be unable to attend his wedding, or in a cast, or worse. \n\nIs there something that you could offer to do with him instead that would be meaningful to the both of you?", "You know your limitations, your brother should respect that.  NTA", "This is what I came to say!", "I'm also overweight, and even people who know and love me don't understand there are limitations. I can't sleep on an air mattress, for instance.

It's hard to find a swimsuit that fits, and when I do have one it's hard to be out in public in it.\n\nIt's little daily things.\n\nYou know your limitations. Stick to your guns and don't apologize. This is valid.", "Would it be possible for you to go but hang back at base camp and read or what have you? Bird watching? (Don\u2019t laugh, I\u2019m that old now.) Or would that still just kind of suck?", "At the very least, it is insensitive on his part. I hate even the idea of going camping and although I am moderately physically active, I just don't have the physical stamina nor the desire to be around others that much. It's just not my thing. It's unreasonable of him to expect everyone to be enthusiastic and available to go. That's quite a long party. It goes both ways:\n\nBrother: \"If you love me, you'll do XYZ.\"\nYou: \"If you love me, you will respect that I don't want to do XYZ.\"\n\nXYZ being no small thing and no necessity, the latter wins.", "Your brother is being a bachzilla. I get being disappointed but being a good brother goes both ways. If it's so important to him that you be there, then he should have considered your health when he made his plans. \n\nNTA. Let him have his feelings but don't give in to emotional blackmail.", "I know you said you don't want to bring the mood down but it sounds like your brother will be down when you wont be there. Maybe you could go and hang around the camp site while they go kayaking or hiking. Make lighthearted jokes about not being able to go with them on activities but offer to grill out for the gang when they return. In the meantime pull up a chair and read a book or see if there is fishing from the shore nearby. Use the time as a vacation for yourself and enjoy being out in nature and relaxing. Offer to bring some drinks that you'll enjoy as well so when they get back then you can sit around the campfire and share tales of your brother growing up and adventures yall had so he knows you still feel close. If it's a longer trip maybe you can at least pop up for a half if it and let them know that your health won't allow you to stay longer. It shows you are making effort to be there for him.", "It can be seen as manipulative but it may not be intended in that way. Sometimes people are just hurt and describe that. \n\nManipulation is intentional, but words and actions can have the same effects without being done to purposely manipulate someone.", "NAH offer to give him a huge send-off party and then show for maybe the last night so you don't have to worry about activities. \nMaybe if you show him that you really do want to be part of it and how much you appreciate how much he wants you involved, he will relax a bit. That way, you will be involved from beginning to end. \nI think it's nice, if there aren't any agendas, how he doesn't see your weight as a problem and he only sees you as you.", "NTA \nBut \nFully think you should consider going and take care of base camp and just being there for the camp fire bonding. \n\nWhen someone really wants you there... Well it's bc you really mean something to them. \n\nReally try to come up with solutions.", "NTA \n\nYour brothers response seems incredibly manipulative", "NAH but I encourage you to rethink! As someone who has been introduced to the outdoors by friends wayyyy more \u201coutdoorsy\u201d than I, I can assure you it\u2019s not as extreme as it may seem. In fact, in my experience it\u2019s more of lounging around the campsite than going on intense adventures. Of course I don\u2019t know how Eric likes to roll, but I just want to assure you that there is plenty of downtime involved when camping. :) Don\u2019t miss out out of fear that you can\u2019t keep up. That being said, do you, listen to your limits, but IMO I think you\u2019ll be able to find a good middle ground in enjoying camping while acknowledging your limits.", "Maybe bring books or something and if someone offers to stay back, express that it\u2019s fine because you\u2019re looking forward to getting some reading or a nap in. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do, as someone who loves to sit out of activities and feels bad (and doesn\u2019t want) anyone hanging behind for me. The number of times I\u2019ve had to kick my boyfriend out so he\u2019ll go do something he finds fun without guilt and I can have some time alone\u2026.", "wouldnt suck for me, i would do that. however my concern is that someone else will stay back with me, and then maybe someone else wants to stay back with that person, and then suddenly the group is split in two for certain activities. i dont want to be the cause of that happening", "If you'd be ok doing that why not discuss your concerns about that happening with him instead of just saying no to coming? \n\nI went for my friend's birthday camping trip 2 weeks after major surgery a few years ago, I could barely walk so definitely wasn't doing any activities beyond hanging out on the beach. I appointed myself chef, figured out and pre-prepped the stuff for some fancy for camping meals, and messed around with that, along with chilling in an inflatable hammock with a book, while they were hiking and kayaking. If you genuinely have your own plans that you'll enjoy (or at least can convincingly pretend you'll enjoy) while they're doing things you won't be joining them for its more likely no one will feel like they have to stay back with you. I highly recommend the camp chef route, it gave me something rather than just feeling left out (I love outdoorsy stuff, so I was pretty disappointed I was too full of staples to join in). And I learned to bake bread in a campfire, so hey, at least I acquired some new skills. \n\nOh, and if you want to go kayaking see about getting a canoe. You'll fit fine, and you can always grab your own vest to bring if you need.", "Oh oh, and what about getting some  outdoor games, that aren\u2019t very physical but still fun for a group, set up? Like ladder golf, bocce ball, giant Jenga, giant Connect-4, croquet, so many options!", "Have that honest conversation with your brother. If you\u2019re willing, perhaps offer that compromise but relay your concerns. In all honesty, some of his friends may not be up for so many physical activities, either. \n\nAlso, how about scheduling some time for an outdoor activity that isn\u2019t so physical, like fishing?", "I considered the camp chef suggestion too, but didn\u2019t want to make OP feel like he has to like, work, if he can\u2019t go on the activities. But you\u2019re right, this is what I would naturally do personally, and it would make me feel involved. Get the grill and fire pit going, have the cold beers ready, that kind of thing. Maybe set up some outdoor games, like ladder golf or bocce ball etc, that aren\u2019t very physical but still fun for a group!", "This sounds like a really great solution / approach.", "NTA but maybe there is a medium here? Designated camp host? Enjoy some nature, protect the site from thieves, be there for the pre/post activity bonding? As long as he can assure you that there won't be pressure to do what you physically can't, and you won't be hurt to pass on things you can't participate in. ??", "NTA.  I hate when people try to guilt trip someone into doing what they want.", "NTA. It doesn't sound like Eric really understands the health risks for you on this trip. It doesn't sound like you would be capable of doing this at the moment. Sucks that he doesn't understand. Makes him kind of an AH. But you should try to reinforce that you really want to celebrate with him. Maybe you can celebrate with him another way.", "NTA but I love the other posters idea of you doing a kickoff with them and then you welcome them back with some kickass bbq and s'mores and booze or w.e stuff he loves .", "NTA. You're backing out for safety reasons and when you agreed to the trip expected it to be in civilization.\n\nHe's not being fair to expect you to go hiking, etc; find out where they're going and do some research on what weight a kayak holds, white water raft and whether a life vest would be available.\n\nIf you did go, you'd slow down their hikes for sure. I was hit by a car several years ago, am overweight but losing and am terrified of stairs. I walk on asphalt paths and would be afraid to go hiking.\n\nNo idea where you live relative to each other but offer to take him out for dinner, just the two of you,", "NTA - if you go you may well be humiliated in front of the group, if you can't fit in a Kayak etc\n\nHe doesn't care about your feelings, its all about what he wants.  He bullied you into a straonger relationship 5 years and he is working you on this matter", "NTA\n\nApparently Eric doesn't value you.", "NTA. In addition to being physically and emotionally uncomfortable for you, canoes and kayaks and rafts usually have weight limits. (I like to kayak and the ones I use typically are rated for 250lbs.)\n\nImagine how awful it would be if the group went to rent this equipment and you were singled out told you could not? Even worse, what if something capsized or sank and you or someone else got hurt?\n\nI like the idea of doing a send off or welcome back celebration. And congratulations on your weight loss success!", "Don't worry, bird watching isn't just for the \"over the hill crowd\". My best friend took it up as a hobby at 25 during the pandemic, and it's become a genuine fascination for the whole friend group. Like, we'll be on a nature walk and she'll point and go \"A yellow-bellied boffin!\" and we all go \"Oooooohhhh! So pretty!\" and then she'll give a brief explanation of their eating or mating habits. Shockingly interesting subject!", "It is!! It was actually very funny when my friends and I began noticing and being interested in the birds around us, haha.", "NTA, he clearly doesn\u2019t realize that you are doing the group a favor by bowing out. I feel like they would enjoy their adventures less if you were holding them back and he is being immature and shortsighted for seeing this as offensive.\n\nAlso congrats for not only prioritizing your physical health but recognizing your limits in the process. I think you have a great shot at getting into the kind of shape where you could join them on the next one.", "NTA but I agree with the other commenter that you should go camping with them but just stay at the campsite while they go hiking and bring stuff to do", "NTA at all. It would be one thing if you\u2019d initially agreed to go camping, but you didn\u2019t. You agreed to a bachelor party - which isn\u2019t usually a camping or hiking trip. One thing you could maybe do is offer to drop him and the other guests off at a hiking trail or boat launch, or if their campsite is easily accessible, offer to bring breakfast the morning after.", "How about telling him that being a good brother goes two ways; that you would have lived doing the trip with him if you were fit.  Originally you assumed his bachelor trip would be more traditional and therefore doable for you.  Since learning it will be very physically taxing for you, it comes down to you taking considerable risk you aren\u2019t able to take on.  \n\nExplain the progress you are making with your weight loss and how much you look forward to one day going camping with him.  It is just not okay now.  Assure him you know he doesn\u2019t want you to be at risk which you would be.  Further explain (firmly) that you also feel certain that your presence on a physically rigorous trip would potentially ruin it for everyone when you could not keep up or sustain an injury far away from medical help.  \n\nTell him you know he understands how much you would live to be there for him if the trip was designed for your level of fitness.  Since it isn\u2019t you look forward to hearing all about it and you\u2019ll see him at the wedding.  \n\nIf he does not accept this, give your relationship a lot of thought.  Your relationship with your step brother should not be an endless number of occasions when you reassure him you love him.  Just as he wants that from you, you are equally entitled to his understanding toward you.", "That sounds normal enough. Perhaps if you tell him/the group just that!"]}
