I would not expose him to secondhand smoke and you should not expose your precious child to it. \n\nNormally one should not make demands while staying with others, but this is an exception, especially since your MIL promised they wouldn\u2019t smoke. Not only would I refuse to visit again, I would leave now before your child is harmed by their smoking.", "NTA\nGet a hotel and leave.\nOr just go home.\nThey lied to you about the conditions of their home being safe and suitable for their grandchilds heath needs.\nCigarettes are obviously more important than their grandkids wellbeing, or showing you the basic respect of sticking to their word. House is full of smoke, so you leave.\n\nThey have every right to smoke in their own home. But they don't have the right to demand you and your kids be subjected to that.\n\nRight now youre just sitting in the next room letting them get away with this. Threatening future theoretical consequences don't mean anything to them now, they'll roll their eyes and say okay sure and wait for you to calm down or assume you'll visit next holiday.\n\n Actual, present moment consequences right now mean something, you're that kids parent and protector and if the smoke is harmful to your kid, assert your boundaries and make it clear that smoking inside is a deal breaker and then follow through. They wanted you here for the holiday they knew what they had to do, so now that they broke their word no family for the holiday. You want to be taken seriously, you have to be assertive. And your husband should be acting like father and calling out his parents.", "NTA.  If they smoke in the house when you are not there, that means there is smoke in the house when you are there.  It lingers indoors and will be a hazard to your child", "NTA and tbh, even if they did withhold smoking with your child present I don't think that necessarily makes the situation any better. Smoke doesn't magically go away when the cigarette burns out! Secondhand smoke is in their drapery, couches, fabrics, wall paint, circulating in the air you breathe through their home. Children develop asthma simply by being held by a smoker because it permeates their clothes, and then that child has to live with permanent breathing issues for life through no fault of their own. Please continue to stick to your guns, your child relies on your protection.", "Being that its their home, they can change the rules anytime they want. You are correct in not wanting them to smoke around your child due to all the health issues he had. To see how serious they are, start packing your stuff and when they ask what you're doing, tell them you will find another place to stay since they obviously don't care about the baby. Then, if they don't stop, leave, go home, go to a hotel, whatever to safeguard your baby.", "Leave", "NTA, they should be mindful of their grandchild and follow the previous precedent they set. However, if they normally smoke indoors, it's got to smell terrible. A hotel sounds way better.\n\nEdit: typos", "NTA but your husband needs to get his shit together and stand up to his parents for the sake of his child. It's HIS parents. He needs to be the one voicing the concerns, not you. And if he doesn't see the big deal about it, leave his ass there and you go home without him.", "Based on their past behavior of not smoking indoors in the past, I say NTA for asking them to continue refraining in deference to your child's health issue. If they refuse, leave and go to a hotel. Honestly the lingering smell on them probably isn't good for your baby. I have issues when I am around a smoker when they have recently lit up. Throat scratches, nose burns and it's just unpleasant.", "Grab your baby and go home. Now. Because this is not a healthy situation for your vulnerable child to be in.\n\nArgue about future visits later. Maybe you'll be fine visiting them when your child is bigger and more resilient.

If your husband is angry at you not being willing to subject your frail infant to a known respiratory irritant, he is very much TA along with the rest of his family.", "NTA- If you can smell it, it's already a problem. Third-hand smoke is still a problem. If you can smell it on your clothes, your child is breathing it in too. So second hand is even worse. Considering your childs history of respiratory distress, this makes your in-laws the AH and then some. It's clear they aren't thinking about you and not even thinking about their own grandchild either. If they can't even consider the health and welfare of their own grandchild, then you need to do what you can to protect your family and that will NEVER make you the AH. Do what you can, and get out of the house ASAP!", "I understand why you are upset but why didn\u2019t you guys just stay at a hotel? \n\nNTA for making that exact decision for future visits though. It makes total sense. \n\nThey are not being super considerate but, like you said, it is their house. You can ask - which you did - but they can still do what they want. It\u2019s really shitty that\u2019s what they want to do is harmful to your sweet baby. But if it\u2019s really an issue\u2026 take that baby and go to a hotel. No one could fault you for protecting your child.", "NTA. Abysmal behaviour from your husband's parents. The baby's safety should come first.", "NTA for wanting to protect your own child. Unfortunately you can't make the rules of how people live in their own home. You can merely ask them politely and hope they comply. If not, you'll have to make some hard decisions.", "INFO: What did your husband say?", "NTA. Get out right now. Just go. Start driving and go somewhere to a hotel or drive in home. Your child\u2019s health is too important", "YTA for posting on Reddit and not getting your baby out of there ASAP.  What is wrong with you?", "NTA. Leave, now, in the middle of the night.", "NTA - lived with a smoker before and although they never smoked around me, it actually got into my clothes and my family and friends actually assumed I had taken it up.  Just avoid it at all costs and ignore the guilt trip you're going to get from it.  It's part of parenting you need to sacrifice, and if your husband doesn't understand, remind him with pictures of when your child was on the ventilator.  A cold tactic, but desperate times call for desperate measures.", "NTA, so what\u2019s best for your little one. You can\u2019t trust those people.", "NTA\n\nNot only are you correct for leaving in this situation, you would be correct in not going back. If they can't even bother to smoke outside when a vulnerable child is in the house, they are definitely smoking inside the house regularly, which makes it an unhealthy environment for both of your children.", "NTA\n\nI take the hard line that smokers don't get to be around babies.\n\nYou were promised a smoke free environment and the in laws have chosen to break that promise. Baby comes first.", "NTA, not only is this dangerous for your son it is simply disrespectful behavior that you do not have to accept.", "As a mom of a 1.25 pound preemie and a nurse, PACK you and your son and leave immediately.  Even the residual in their clothing is dangerous for him, much less smoking in the next room.   NTA", "NTA. Your babys health is WAY more important than your in laws getting their fix. As a smoker myself, I wouldn't be caught anywhere near your bub either with a smoke, or just after just having one (sure to wash hands, brush teeth before engaging with him) they are being extremely disrespectful.", "NTA I have asthma. Even when someone isn't currently smoking, I can smell it and feel the difference breathing. \n\nMy Dad quit smoking in the house because of this. They sound like real jerks if they can't just wait or go outside. Even if your baby didn't have health issues at birth, smoking in the house with a baby is unhealthy.", "NTA.  Fuck them, they can smoke outside.  Put on a fucking jacket, go out and smoke.", "NTA. Your baby almost died.  Has breathing issues. Pack up and leave.  They are endangering his health.

We are just leaving tonight but my husband's upset about it and isn't taking this as seriously as he should. I explained why multiple times. I brought an air purifier which being right next to us I feel makes the air safer around us to breathe but it doesn't stand up to people actively smoking and it being blown directly into our space.

And I remember a huge family fight when the 2 week old baby developed asthma. The baby mama was a smoker \"outdoor only and never around the baby\", but my ex's father did smoke in the house \"in the bathroom only with the window open\". It was a big blame game who gave the baby asthma. I just remember feeling so sorry for the helpless baby who had no control of its environment, given a lifelong condition by the adults responsible for protecting it.", "Leave your husband behind with his parents if he just doesn't get it.", "Ok, cool. I'm just double checking before I go in on him, too.\n\nIt is never ok to smoke inside a place where you have invited guests to stay, under the pretense of no smoking. It is even less ok to do it with any 5 month old inside the home. It is downright disrespectful and pathetic to do it with a 5 month old, who has known LUNG problems, inside the home. \n\nNow for your husband. Who the F cares whether or not he can smell it? It's smoking inside the house. You obviously have trauma from your son's NICU stay. He needs to start worrying about his family instead of his moms feelings, or eventually, he's just gonna have his moms feelings.", "\n\nAs a college educated person with scientific interests I really thought he would get what I'm saying and where I'm coming from but he said something so ignorant just now \n\n\" I ( a continuously congested individual with severe allergies) can't smell anything so I don't think he can either\"", "Honestly they can have eachother.  He can either come home with us or stay with them but I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only one that gives a fuck about my kid.

I hated his smoking and I never smoked. When I was a junior in high school my health class had a machine that we blew into and it would register lung function. I registered as a heavy smoker, just from second hand smoke every other weekend. It doesn't take much smoke to cause problems/damage. It doesn't matter if they are in the next room, you and your child are breathing that smoke. I realize that you are not going to be exposed as much as I was but maybe this example can help your husband to understand how little smoke it takes to cause problems. I'm really glad you are leaving but your husband is being an ass.", "I mean, he can stay there. But I dont think you'd feel happy in the end if you just ended it. I think yall need counseling (yes, I know, ew). But they're great mediators when communication is subpar.  He also just had a baby in the NICU. Both dads and moms can have postpartum depression and birth trauma. Not excusing his behavior, just saying he also might be kinda silently struggling.\n\nIf that doesn't help, then you'll feel a lot better about the future decision regarding your relationship.", "Yes. I know I'm just upset right now and I'll regret low key insulting him like that later, but what hurts the most is the feeling that he doesn't take our sons heath as seriously as I do given we both went through the same thing when he was hospitalized.  \n\nIdk.\n\n Sometimes events in life ( no matter how big or small) happen, and those events might cause one to think differently about a person ..and I think this is one of those times.  \n\nCurrently on the nearly 3 hour ride home and I'm getting the silent treatment", "He's selfish and too much so to even see it. I'm also sorry you had to endure that and for the problems it caused you later.", "Oh no I'm not leaving him, I'm just realizing that maybe he isn't as intelligent as I've always thought him to be. Science doesn't care about your opinion. Disagreeing with science without the proper knowledge and ability to do so doesn't make you superior. It just makes you wrong. \n\nIt's his opinion that the benefits outweigh the risk. It is my opinion that maybe he doesn't care as much about our son as I though he did. And that is a very shitty feeling that's hard to come back from. He's always been like this with his mom though. She's always right, everything she says and does is gold and he eats it up and this overall issue has just been a long time coming and finally came to a boil. This time it's not just about me, its about a precious baby that can't advocate for himself. So I'm putting my foot down.", "I meant the \"yikes\" fully in support of you. Your husband needs to take your son's health more seriously. Make sure to talk to the doctor together about this kind of issue. Maybe he'll believe it more if the expert says it.", "I shouldn't have, but I laughed when you questioned his intelligence. There's literally no benefit to staying there besides saving money on a trip back. Which is a small price to pay considering the current hospital bills that you probably have, and the possible new ones you might collect if your son does have problems due to the smoke.\n\nIt would also look super bad on him if your son did have problems due to her smoking. Cause it doesn't sound like you'd lie to your son's doctors.", "Oh yes, I've already told my husband to make sure to memorize everything he's said tonight ( because I will) so that he may accurately repeat it to the pediatrician when we see him. If he won't listen to me, maybe he will listen to a professional. Although his family have a bad history of thinking they know it all while dismissing medical professionals... and I fear he's no exception.", "It's okay.  I would laugh if I were in your shoes as well. \n\nAnd we're currently in the car ride home and I'm getting the silent treatment. \n\nJokes on him, I'm enjoying the peace and quiet. \n\nAnd absolutely not. In fact I've already told my husband to expect to have this conversation in front of the pediatrician and to remember everything he said tonight so he can repeat it word for word to a doctor whose job it is to know the repercussions of these types of things.", "All mom's need peace and quiet. \ud83d\ude05 Hopefully, he's also quietly thinking about what just happened. \n\nBtw, I know everyone is harping on the negative in this situation. But your son couldn't have asked for a better mom. I know new mom life is rough. You're doing a wonderful job at it.", "Absolutely.  \n\nAnd thank you so very much. You have no idea how much that means to me in a world made to make us feel like we're never doing enough!"]}
