Smoke doesn't magically go away when the cigarette burns out! Secondhand smoke is in their drapery, couches, fabrics, wall paint, circulating in the air you breathe through their home.

She's always right, everything she says and does is gold and he eats it up and this overall issue has just been a long time coming and finally came to a boil.
