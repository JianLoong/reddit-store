The arguments usually stem from my father. My Dad and I basically have zero relationship. It has been an accumulation of him being quite mean and nasty to me my entire childhood. I don\u2019t really care about our lack of relationship and don\u2019t have any desire to fix it. However, the relationship with my father is causing strain with my relationship with my mother. My mum can be quite chill, but my Dad is not. He is an extreme authoritarian and whenever me and him have a disagreement, my mum constantly betrays me and takes his side, regardless of the situation and how she really feels. It has been happening quite a lot recently and a recent situation has made me start to question a lot. \n\nI\u2019m currently in college and and live about a 2 and a half hour drive from my hometown. My Dad has been demanding I wake up early every Sunday morning to join a live-streamed church service. I\u2019ve made it quite clear that church isn\u2019t really my thing, (I\u2019m not an atheist, but I do not like the atmosphere of most churches) however whenever I am at home I still go because I have to listen to the rules when I am under their roof. However, when I am in college I don\u2019t see any reason to join and I simply don\u2019t want to. This has been a point of contention for years, and it\u2019s mostly going back and forth between me refusing to join and me trying to appease him and just giving in. \n\nThe relationship between my parents and I has gotten considerably worse recently and I\u2019ve decided that I won\u2019t give in to their demands anymore, as I\u2019m not a child. I didn\u2019t join the church call last Sunday, and in the evening my mother rang me. She was furious. She called me selfish, inconsiderate and said I only care about myself. The reason why she said this is because whenever I don\u2019t listen to my Dad, he takes his anger out on her. She says she shouts at her and that I need to just give in because she\u2019s being shouted at because of my actions. She\u2019s mentioned this before but never like this. She went on a long rant and then asked for an apology. I couldn\u2019t take the ridiculousness anymore and I guess she could hear me trying to stifle my laughs. She asked me if I was laughing and I said no, but I guess it wasn\u2019t convincing enough. She went silent for about 3 minutes without saying anything, and at that point I just ended the call. We haven\u2019t spoken since. I mostly laughed because of the shock, but really I am quite hurt and angry. I don\u2019t think I should be responsible for fixing my parents marriage. It makes me sad that my own mother is choosing  to appease my horrid father over a relationship with me. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I\u2019ve mentioned in the comments that I am partially financially dependent on them, as they pay my rent out here. This information has led to people telling me that I am indeed the asshole. I would like to pay my own rent, however, my parents were VERY adamant about me not working, they said it would interfere with school. I had a part time job lined up, told them about it casually, and they went nuclear and told me to quit.", "created_utc": 1695668315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16s0mv9/aita_for_laughing_at_my_mother_and_then_ending/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't blame you for her husband's behavior, everyone is responsible for their own actions and you're not responsible for his.\n\nIt's quite possible that your mom is in denial and stuck in an abusive relationship, it's sometimes hard to open your eyes to your SO's true nature. She doesn't see your dad as the problem, so she blames you. I hope you can move out soon and feel free to live your life without constraints.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t responsible for how your father treats your mother. If they are supporting you financially they may have leverage over you, but I ultimately wholeheartedly agree regardless that they shouldn\u2019t force you to go to church.", "NTA - your father sounds like an abusive AH. I would highly suggest going LC or full NC with him if you can, and let your mom know she is in an abusive relationship she should consider ending. If he yells at her for things that aren't under her control, imagine what else he does she won't admit to. \n\nEveryone responds to stress differently, your laughter wasn't at your mother, but more the absurdity of the situation.", "NTA,\n\n  \nYou are not responsible for your father's bad behaviour. If you do not want to go, they cannot force you to. I think forcing someone to join you for church is the real selfish thing to do.\n\nAlso people who point out he is the asshole because he laughed,\n\n> I mostly laughed because of the shock, but really I am quite hurt and angry. \n\nIt is called Nervous Laughter, it can happen. He is not mocking her.", "NTA.  You have to set boundaries. BUT you also need to follow up with your mother and explain that you love her and you feel hurt. She needs to know that you do not think you will have a meaningful relationship with your father, and you understand that she wants to stay with him but that you refuse to do what he wishes.", "Well, I can certainly see why you don\u2019t go to a commuter school. \n\nOf course you don\u2019t have to live stream anything on Sunday morning, (unless you want to keep the peace). But since you are two and a half hours from your parents, when they get all upset at you, you can just hang up the phone. What are they gonna do, drive five plus hours round trip to berate you? \n\nI do hope your independence from their flavor of organized superstition doesn\u2019t jeopardize your college career. It would suck for you if they pulled your funding. But if that is not a problem, lol, you can turn your ringer off and sleep in on Sunday. NTA", "NTA.  You are not selfish, your dad is yelling at her because you are a person with your own desires and not some robot following commands.  SHE is choosing to stay with her abuser (YES ABUSER) and instead of blaming her own choice to stay with him, she is blaming you.  She doesn't have to take being yelled at, but she chooses to.  This is all on her and her choices, not you.", "NTA and I am sorry your mum won't stand up for you (and herself).", "NTA. honestly, i feel sorry for you. your mom takes everything out on you which isn\u2019t right at all.", "NTA\n\nYou mom sounds like it may be an abusive situation for her.  Why would your father blame her if you do anything?  \n\nGood Luck Op, but watch out for your mom, I hope all is well with her also.", "NTA- I am assuming you were experiencing nervous laughter from your description of the situation and you also directly stated \"because of the shock\".  When younger people get overly stressed, the brain can flood with endorphins as a physiological coping mechanism and cause inappropriate laughter or other expressions in the moment- having nothing to do with whether they find it funny or not.  Been there- it's awful! I imagine that your mother laying the blame for your father's abuse of her on your shoulders is likely the stressor/trigger.  As you said, you aren't responsible for fixing their marriage, but it may be helpful for you and your Mom to talk to a therapist or counselor together as you transition into full adulthood. Now that you aren't the child buffer anymore, she will be able to manage the situation with him less and less effectively and you both will need the tools to preserve your relationship.", "YTA. Because you still use them for their money.", ">She called me selfish, inconsiderate and said I only care about myself. The reason why she said this is because whenever I don\u2019t listen to my Dad, he takes his anger out on her.\n\nShe chose to marry him. She chose to have you. She chooses to stay. You need to cut contact for awhile.\n\nOh they're paying your rent. Dude. Come on. YTA.", "YTA. Your laughter during that call was incredibly insensitive.

You need to put it to your mom this way: She is not being verbally abused because of anything you are doing. She is being verbally abused because your father CHOOSES to take his anger out on her. But don't laugh at her... she's not being ridiculous, she's just trying to make a intolerable situation a little safer for herself. She's reacting how he's trained her to react - put pressure on you to do what he wants in order to lessen his wrath. It doesn't make it your responsibility, but be kind to her.", "NTA", "your mother is just as bad as your father. She put up with the way your father treated you all these years and still does. Why do you even want to have contact with a person like that? In so many stories, one parent is the \u201cdevil\u201d and one is the \u201cangel,\u201d which cannot be the case with such treatment. The good parent should separate from the real one to protect the child. If the good guy doesn't do that, he's just as bad as the bad guy.", "NTA.

I hope you can maintain a connection with your mom so that she can have a relationship with you and your future kids on your terms.

OP does say in comments below that they support her. *That's an assumption, OP doesn't say one way or the other.  OP could be on a scholarship, or loans, or working.

I don\u2019t consider her to be \u201ccaught in the middle\u201d or an innocent party because she constantly takes his side and adds her two cents.
