The person this post is about is Luke.He\u2019s severely dyslexic and is practically illiterate. My mom use to force me and my older brother to teach him until he\u2019s finished his work. Sometimes he\u2019d finish at midnight and we were not allowed to eat until he was done (this usually meant no dinner or lunch) the hardest part of teaching him was getting him to listen he\u2019s my mom\u2019s favourite and a spoilt brat if he has to do any work at he\u2019ll through a fit and we will all get in trouble or be forced to do the work for him. The only reason he\u2019s even able to count is because I had to spend a whole day when I was maybe 9 or ten with a bit of my dads help to teach him. Luke is also useless at helping out with chores you ask him to wash HIS dish he starts crying ask him to clean HIS mess he starts crying and so on. In my mum\u2019s defence she sometimes is very sick due to her high blood pressure and we have to sort our own food out. He screams and cries if me or my brother make ourselves food but don\u2019t make for him. The problem with making food for him is that he\u2019s picky we either have to make a new dish or eat whatever he wants. Today Ava and Luke had lesson with their tutor. Ava was very rude to her teacher basically just being her a normal spoilt self. When their tutor dropped them off Ava ran in to get my mom and talked to her about how her teacher was \u201crude\u201d. My mom talked to the tutor and long story short my mom stopped my sisters lesson as punishment. My mum is now saying that I have to teach Luke and even if I wanted to do that I don\u2019t have the time. I am in top set science and I want to stay there so I\u2019ve got to revise ,I have a test coming up ,4 days a week I have tutoring for 2 hours,I have to do my chores (bathroom kitchen dining) and I need to do my tuition homework. I also watch my (12f) sister she\u2019s non-verbal autistic but I love her to bits but she\u2019s difficult to look after especially when I have to clean her by myself.I do not have time but she would not take no for an answer. Normal I try to hid my feelings deep down but I hate my brother so much I wish I never had to see him again him and Ava have taken up so much off my life I have to do nearly everything for them.\n\nWill I be the AITA if I refuse to help my brother and leave him to learn and sort himself out.", "created_utc": 1687025504, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14bxonv/aita_for_hating_my_younger_brother/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Of course you're NTA for your feelings. They are valid. You are effectively parenting your siblings, which is child abuse on the part of your mother.\n\nYou can discuss your concerns with a teacher. They have resources at their disposal and are required to report abuse to the proper authorities. However, I will warn you that the outcomes of these calls are not guaranteed. While usually they make an attempt to keep siblings together in a foster scenario, you could be separated from O and A both, or even G also. I don't necessarily think that's what you want, even in the short term.\n\nYour mother absolutely needs to get her shit together, though. This is a completely unreasonable situation to put you in. I'm sorry.", "Your mom is an AH; talk to an adult at school or someone you trust. This is not an acceptable way to raise children.", "NTA-- I don't think you actually hate your brother, I think that's the emotion you're most feeling because processing your feelings towards your mom is too overwhelming. She is the parent, you are the child. Yet she seems to be expecting you to act as a parent and that's not fair. Also, she's clearly pitting you against each other. Not letting you eat until he's finished something meaning you're skipping meals is abusive. Full stop. \n\nFocus on yourself and what makes you happy as much as possible. Focus on learning a professional skill or getting into college and embarking on an independent life as soon as you're 18.", " NTA it is not your job to parent your siblings and your mom needs to figure something else out. High blood pressure is not an excuse.", "NTA op. I'm so sorry you've been put in this position. This parentification is actually abusive. Do you have school counselors or a trusted adult you can talk to about this with? You are NOT a parent to your siblings and should never be treated as such. \n\nI know it's hard to believe right now but your hatred is misdirected at your sibling. He doesn't know this situation is wrong because he's been trained that it's normal.  Regardless, you are not his caretaker/parent and should not be treated as such.  Good luck op, I hope this works out for you.", "Oh, op, I'm sorry that this is your life, and I can't really give judgement here. Your mom is doing the absolute wrong thing by forcing you and your brother to parent your other siblings. It is only natural to have a lot of built up resentment towards him, but it's really your mom you should be mad at. Please try and find another adult, either relative or school counselor, maybe even a friend's mom, who you could at least talk to about all this stuff. My heart goes out to you, you're doing an awesome job under some very tough circumstances, this internet stranger is very proud of you.", "NTA; it\u2019s not your job to parent your siblings. It\u2019s your job to be a kid. High blood pressure is not an excuse and where is your dad in all of this?!", "Your brother's behavior is a product of his upbringing.  Your parents and the way they have enabled him and neglected you are 100% at fault.  I know you see your brother as the cause and it would honestly be hard not to.  But he isn't at fault.  You're young and I understand how hard it must be to separate him from your feelings.  Try your best.  NTA for giving in to those feelings at your age or anything else.  You seem to have done your best in an awful situation.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I don't think it's hatred towards them rather than resentment towards your mom for making you and your older brother the teachers and parent them. \n\nYour mom using her high blood pressure is an excuse to not teach or parent them herself.", "NTA. While it's important to help family when we can, it's not fair or realistic to expect a 14-year-old to act as a caregiver, tutor, and housekeeper, especially when it's negatively impacting your mental health and academic progress. You need to focus on your own life too. I recommend discussing these feelings with your parents or a trusted adult.", "NTA - So I'm severely dyslexic and having severe reading difficulties in that age range. So first... you can't help a dyslexic person the way you would a non-dyslexic person. The ways you need to teach a dyslexic person are different. If you don't know those ways, then you are likely not actually helping him. That isn't your fault. He needs the help of someone who is a professional who knows how to teach dyslexic people. \n\nDoes he get help in school? If not, your mom needs to get him diagnosed and get him in special education. If he is, then your mom needs to get his plan updated and worked on. This isn't something you can fix or should be asked to.", "NTA. This is the unfortunate reality of disability. It's easy to wax lyrical about how other people in situations  you'll never personally have to deal with are assholes, but 95% of the people who'll condemn you for this would act the exact same way if they were in your shoes. Disability is hard on the people who feel  obligated to support the disabled person too, ie family. You didn't  ask for it any more than your brother did, and it impacts your quality of life to a significant degree too. \n\nYou've had a really rather unfortunate circumstance of birth, as have your siblings, and you have to remember that emotions are inherently irrational - people in these situations often have moral values that would say their unchangeable emotions make  them  a bad  person, but by definition, you can't be immoral for your emotions because you can't choose what your emotions are.  Just remember that while the emotions are valid, it's not your siblings' fault. You can hate their conditions, you can hate being forced to take care of them, you can hate having to spend  time with  them or live with them, but try not to take that anger out on  them, because there's  not really anything they  can do about  it.\n\nIf there's any asshole in this situation, it's your mother for having too many kids and using the  oldest ones as substitute parents. And there is at least a silver lining here - I bet  you end up having a very close relationship with your  older brother, cos there's probably a lot of  shared trauma there, and  if Luke's only real problem is the dyslexia, and Ava has no developmental disabilities besides being an obnoxious tween, those two'll  probably be a lot nicer in ten or fifteen years when they've grown up and entered the portion of life where you can actually do alright even with severe dyslexia. The non-verbal autistic sibling might  be more of a challenge long-term, but hopefully there'll be four (or even eight of  you, counting partners) to spread the load.", "NTA", "NTA. it's not your job to teach your brother but your mother's job which she is avoiding by making excuses . I want to ask what will happen if you to teach him . you can tell your mother that you find it hard to manage time for studying your own course .", "ESH\n\nLook, your post is about hating your brother, but the reasons you brought up are actually caused by your mother's questionable parenting.\nSadly, it is a very common thing among siblings to grow hatred towards each other while the ones at fault are actually the parents. \nYour brother isn't to blame for his condition and while he's still responsible for his own behaviour and you're allowed to and should tell him when he's being an asshole towards you, it very much sounds like your mother raised him to be like that.\nAnd you're resentment is totally valid and understandable because there's everything wrong about your mother forcing you and your other sibling to basically do her - or a professional's - job. But again, that's not your brother's responsibility, is it?", "YTA, in a way, for blaming your brother rather than your parents. Sounds like he has some significant issues that he is not getting enough help for. I understand your resentment and exasperation but you're aiming it at the wrong person.", "YTA For hating your brother, that's messed up, but your mom is the bigger AH for putting this on her children. This is her responsibility as a parent to provide the best for her kids, and that means she needs to take on more. I get she has a condition, but if that's the case, she needs to admit she needs help for your brother beyond the tutoring. He needs to have an aide if he is this way, and there was no mention of dad, so he needs someone to monitor and mentor him since mom might not be capable. Also, you're not an adult, so this is way out of your league to begin with. Watching O and A when mom's out on errands or in the bathroom/on a call is the extent of the care you can provide for them, as you weren't trained to handle meltdowns and tantrums. You are an overextended 14 yr old who is on the verge of a breakdown, and this needs to be addressed now. Mom needs to get help.

It might be he is a spoiled brat. But for the whole situation you have your parents to thank for who seem to have very questionable education methods.  \nNo food as a punishment for a task that is not even yours in the first place? There is absolutely no reason to deny food to children, least the own ones. In no situation!  What your parents do is worth a call at child support. They mistreat you.  \nAlso your brother cannot do much about it, since being dyslexic means he needs very special paedagogic approaches to learn how to read and write. People doing that as a job have a certain good education to help with that. Expecting something like that from children leaves me speechless the second time.  \nThe whole situation sounds as if your parents cannot handle life with children at all and your family needs serious help, most of all you and your siblings, including your brother.  \n\n\nPlease try to find a help hotline of your country if situations become too much for you. Several countries offer these. But the only person who can decide if you want to do this, is you.", "NTA you should tell this to a trusted adult.

I understand that the way our country is set up doesn\u2019t really allow for that level of consideration at any point in the process.

Luke himself is an 11 y/o boy acting like an 11 y/o boy and likely acting out further DUE to not having appropriate support or accountability - this is a result of your mum\u2019s actions, it\u2019s not because he\u2019s an inherently bad kid. Make sure your blame falls where it\u2019s due. You shouldn\u2019t be having to feed, educate, or clean your siblings - that is your mother\u2019s job.
