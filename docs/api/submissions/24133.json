If it's hurtful and significant to your husband, he's the one to put the time and energy into, maybe. Planning a trip on your own around that time, supporting him if he wanted to raise it with his brother and get more information, venting about how it's confusing etc. It is much more sympathetic if you reached out to BIL because this is upsetting to your husband, vs to provoke conflict, but given what your BIL seems to be like it's hard to see how it would go well or be productive, and it's ultimately your husband's relationship to manage and address.", "You have said this twice at this point.\n\nTHIS IS YOUR HUSBANDS ISSUES NOT YOURS.  \n\nYou do not talk to  BIL.

I appreciate that perspective. I did frame it that my husband was upset and really saddened by the non-invite and that my husband deeply values their relationship.

His response tells us who the asshole is.", "I'm wondering why you're so shocked that a \"man\" who would cut his own children out of his life to placate a girlfriend would not invite his brother to his wedding. Regardless, NTA. But, since you stated that you and your husband are comfortable financially and considering how his children might feel while their father is off marrying this...

Show them that their Uncle values family, even if their father does not.", "OP, a really good friend of mine and my husband's was essentially in the same position your nieces are in right now. I think you're probably NTA for this, but I think a wedding invite should probably be the least of yours and your husband's concerns. \n\nReally, the best input I have is that you two need to be there for your nieces. If that means your BIL and his new wife are upset, so be it. As someone who's really close to the abandoned kid (even if they were abandoned as an adult), it's brutal, and it's made even more brutal if that side of the family goes along with it. \n\nSupport your nieces, give them the love their father has decided not to give them.", "NTA. Drunk or not, I think the question was actually a fair one. The swift, angry response, as well as everything else you've said here makes me believe that your BIL is about to trap himself into an abusive relationship.
