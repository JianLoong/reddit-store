If you need a pet, start looking for a different living situation with a roommate who's okay with it.  \n  \nSecondly, Snakes and reptiles are also common phobias for people - if your roommate has a phobia, she will never be comfortable in her own home.

Did you discuss pets in general prior to rooming or shortly thereafter? \n\nMy son has had a python for years but the care has now fallen to me because he lost interest.

If you get a snake there is still a possibility it will get out and end up either in the shared living space or even in your roommate\u2019s room. \n\nNever bring pets in a home before everyone agrees to it. I have an extreme fear of snakes. I don\u2019t talk about it because I\u2019ve never put myself in a situation where I would see/interact with them. Seeing one will send me into a panic attack. What if your roommate is the same way or has a similar reaction to snakes. If you get one it could lead to a lot of problems. For instance, she could have a panic attack which cause her to have problems with breathing or just stop breathing all together. She could faint and hit her head and it leads to her dying (either via head trauma or blood loss)\n\nThose injuries would end up being your fault, since you brought in the pet without consulting your roommate.

Introducing an animal is a big deal, especially if it's something that freaks her out.

I think it\u2019s pretty clear by OPs writing they have a very childish and short sided point of view. I am not confident in their ability to keep reptiles. \n\nThese are not animals to be on a tight budget for. Really no pet is, but especially not snakes.", "So where is the snake now? They live a long time.", "The majority of pet owners don\u2019t think their pets smell. \n\nThat\u2019s because they got used to the smell. \n\nTrust me, when I enter a house with pets, I know it immediately.", "Yes chemically they are both caritin but the explanation I provided is what most people use since most people don\u2019t care to much about the chemical make up of things, they care about the easily observable characteristics. \n\nAdditionally \u201cHair\u201d vs \u201cfur\u201d doesn\u2019t effect allergies that much beyond: longer/thicker variants hold more oil/ dandruff, when compared to shorter/thinner variants.", "I had a python and a corn snake, but I handled them regularly even when I wasn\u2019t feeding them. This was so they got used to people and didn\u2019t display any aggression, it also helped if they needed my assistance with shedding. A friend took in her brothers snake after he died and he\u2019d basically had no interaction apart from cleaning and he was vicious to the point that to clean his viv you had to push him to one side and hope he didn\u2019t bite, he couldn\u2019t be handled at all. In the end she had to give it to a snake rescue as they were the only ones that could deal with him", "Right but the point is you abandoned it to do what you want only two years in. You signed up for a creature who lives a decade at least. Certainly things happen and circumstances change, but you gave up after barely 1/5th of that commitment time because it no longer fit what you wanted to do. \n\nThat\u2019s bad pet ownership. And it shows that you aren\u2019t ready for the responsibility.", "Moved across the country and didn\u2019t want to put it through the stress of traveling that far so I rehomed him", "A snake doesn\u2019t give a shit about having a different caretaker. It\u2019s not a dog lol", "I\u2019m addressing the issues with that on another comment thread regarding the same questions, so you can read that response.", "That\u2019s also not the point. It\u2019s that you gave a living thing away because you\u2019re tired of it. this is a morality sub. \n\nIt is morally wrong to purchase animals as temporary toys to be passed off or forgotten about later. They\u2019re living things that should be valued in a way that shows you understand the responsibility and commitment of another life. \n\nYou sound like the people shelters beg not to get puppies for Christmas or bunnies for Easter.", "Get a new roommate if you want but don't get something you're gonna neglect before your next lease is up. I would want to live with you snake or no snake"]}
