Not even with your parents.\n\nNTA", "I didn't accuse you of anything, I was explaining my line of thinking concerning the crazy sister wanting to lob off entire inches. \n\nAnd trimming hair isn't a haircut. At no point is it said that the hair doesn't get trimmed, just that it's long, hair can be trimmed and stay long. I should know, I have long hair and I trim it. \n\nYou are aggressive for no reason and making a false presumption. Literally nowhere does it say that the girl's hair has never gotten a trim after mom's death.", "They want her to cut her hair to shoulder length - it\u2019s not currently shoulder length. We don\u2019t know how long it is.", "Your sister\u2019s definitely, 100% jealous of your daughter\u2019s long, blonde hair.\n\nNTA.", "NTA what the heck is wrong with your family? Is your sister the golden child because trying to accommodate an unreasonable request at the cost of your child's grief is unbelievably cruel. You're doing the right thing by protecting her from such horrid people.", "NTA sounds like your sister is jealous and acting like a brat", "Be careful. There\u2019s another post on here with a woman whose sister got her drunk and cut her hair while she was passed out (also \u201cfor her wedding\u201d). Don\u2019t let your daughter around any of these people, you never know. \n\nAlso, what\u2019s creepy is your sister seeing a young pre-teen\u2019s physical appearance as intimidating to her \u201cspecial day\u201d. She\u2019s the one adultifying your child, and it\u2019s gross as hell.", "NTA. Why TF are brides so ridiculous? \n\nKudos to your daughter for caring for her hair. And I'm sorry for the loss of wife and mom for your and your daughter.", "NTA if this situation is exactly as presented. However reading between the lines is it possible that this is your family being worried that you are subtly, though perhaps inadvertently, encouraging your daughter to keep her hair like her mother's? It could be they've jumped on the opportunity created by the wedding to try and help her.  Chat to your daughter about the haircut if you haven't already, presenting it in a completely unbiased way, and give her the final say.", "NTA -since when is resembling a biological freaking parent \u201ccreepy\u201c in any way whatsoever? \n\nNOTE: Better keep daughter away from sis if sis has scissors in her hand. For real. \u201cOops\u2026 I only wanted to trim a bit that needed it: Now you have to cut the rest of it short to even it out. Oh, well!\u201d", "NTA...who tf ask something like this? How ? Why? So weird", "NTA. You were understandably taken aback by the inappropriate request, and then your sister tried to manipulate you by claiming you were the one being inappropriate. \n\nIf your sister has stumbled onto some kernel of truth regarding your own attachment to your daughter's hair and how that may give her a sense of guilt or obligation, well that's for you to work through with your daughter and a therapist. It certainly isn't okay to use your grief against you to make you acquiesce to unreasonable demands.", "NTA.  Your sister & family are weird.", "Happy cake day!!", "The insinuation that he's trying to keep her as some kind of mini-me of his late wife is the nugget atop this shit sundae. OP is definitely NTA, tell her to get bent.", "Not only would cutting the daughter's hair against her will be evil, but it will likely make things worse. Hair can take *years* to grow long, and that's if the family does not keep insisting on her keeping it short. What the actual bleep does the family think it's doing???\n\nOP, do not ignore your daughter's wishes on this. It will set a bad precedent with your family and damage your relationship with your child.", "Good advice! What's creepy is a grown woman about to get married focusing on a preteens hair style. To the point she engages the child's grandparents in trying to put pressure on and the grandparents go along with it!?!\n\nI'm so glad OP is standing up for his daughter. Definitely NTA and I hope you take this opportunity to make some new traditions with your daughter that keep her well away from this toxic behavior over the holidays. \n\nSo sorry that your family is making an already difficult situation worse. I'd walk away for both of your mental health.", "This right here I didn\u2019t cut my hair until I was 14 I got it trimmed but never cut it, I knew how to take care of it and manage it but my aunt got jealous because she had to cut hers off due to a bad dye job and she took me for my trim my hair went from below my butt to just above my shoulders. I was a mess for months.", "[removed]", "Your sister was so mad that she couldn't force a bodily change on a child she is clearly jealous of that she accused you of inappropriate thoughts regarding your own daughter. \n\nDid I miss anything?\n\nYour daughter has as much right to bodily autonomy as any adult.\nYou are being a good dad by acknowledging and respecting that.\nYou are protecting your daughter and the memory she has of her mother.\n\nYou have done NOTHING wrong. \n\nYour sister and parents are wrong. They are the ones being creepy. It's not normal to think a child and her hair will outshine a full grown adult. It's shitty to enable that thinking like your parents are doing. What they are trying to minimise as just a \"new hairstyle\" will affect the positive associations your daughters has with her hair and may even cause her to develop negative feelings about her appearance. You cannot let this happen,  especially at her vulnerable age. Body issues can last forever. I still remember my mother making a huge deal about me having a fringe when I was 7. I'm nearly 40 now and I've hated my forehead ever since.\n\nYour daughter's body, her choice. She needs this affirmed now so that she knows she can say no in the future when someone tries to push her into doing something with her body that she's not comfortable with. And believe me, it will happen. Whether it's unwanted touching, remarks, or demands for images... it happens to all girls and women at some point. Do not break her faith that she controls her body now.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n>I called her out on it and she told me it's her wedding and that it almost seemed as if I was the one who has an issue with the idea since my daughter's hair looks a lot like my wife's. She thought was creepy.\n\nNo its not creepy. Its really not a big deal to have a long hair. If your daughter wants to keep it then she should. Your sister is being weird tbh", "NTA", "NTA - not in wedding party so no say open hair style for wedding. Even if in wedding still no right to say cut the hair. Your daughters body her choice.", "NTA. Your sister is creepy as hell to be jealous of a child\u2019s hair. Ew.", "GOD I'm so sorry your family is being this horrible to your daughter and you. NTA", "NTA- I would NEVER expect anyone to EVER change their hair (esp CUT it for an event of MINE). It doesn't matter what's going on or what event it is- that's NOT a thing. Your sister is deranged. I'm sorry, but she is. That's creepy, destructive, and controlling. Who in their right mind would do that?", "Wow I\u2019ve heard of bridezillas and understand that the bride has the final say on her special day but this is a little much. She\u2019s really crossing the line asking\u2026sorry, demanding your daughter cut her hair! Liked you said, your daughter isn\u2019t part of the wedding party and even if she were demanding a haircut for a one day event is just plain rude. You\u2019re definitely NTA here but your sister sure sounds like one.", "Exactly! I don\u2019t even know how a bride has the audacity to even suggest someone changing their hair drastically. \n\nOP, your sister is using her wedding as a way to be controlling over you and especially your daughter. Not you but she is the one who is creepy. Protect your daughter. I hate for you that you have lost your wife and your daughter her mother. I bet your daughter likes the way she looks like her mom. For this issue with your sister it does not matter though. Her suggestion was out of line anyway.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Don't let them near her without your presence until after the wedding! You're doing the right thing by declining to go to the wedding, but if it were me I would be petty and tell extended family why I was not going to sister's wedding just to make her look bad! Lol!", "I have long hair myself and am pretty protective of it. \n\nI disowned the family hair stylist for lobbing entire inches off me because she thought giving me shorter hair would be cute. As her regular, she knew damn well that I have rules about how short my hair gets to be. \n\nI know do my own hair at home because I know how to cut it and I refuse to have a repeat of my hair stylist.\n\nPeople with long hair usually take great care of it, so someone wanting to lob off a person's pride and joy that they cherish is just evil."]}
