{"id": 15875, "submission_id": "1312ika", "title": "AITA for not wanting to live with my mother anymore?", "selftext": "My (22F) mother (40F) is an alcoholic. I\u2019ve been through a lot because of that, from tracking her phone because she got drunk and disappeared, to staying up until 4a.m because she brought home a man I don\u2019t know (more than once). Besides that, her friends basically live at our place, and as an autistic person, it\u2019s specially hard for me to deal with people I don\u2019t know smoking weed and listening to blasting music in my living room. \n\nLast week, she went on a date with a guy and brought him home. He left around 1a.m, and she was beyond drunk at that point. I asked her to stop bringing people she barely know to our house, mainly due to safety reasons, and she then proceeded to tell me how it\u2019s her house (even though we share the bills), and how she can do whatever she wants and bring whoever she wants. \n\nWhen my mom gets to that point, it\u2019s hard to argue with her, so I just accepted it, locked myself in my room (she was yelling and tried to break my door) and went to sleep. I was planning on talking to her on the next day, but she texted me while I was at work telling me to pack my things and get out of her house. After that, I moved in with my grandparents (from my father\u2019s side), and they were beyond happy to have me.\n\nDue to my mother\u2019s history, they\u2019ve asked me to go live with them a few times over the years, but I\u2019ve never agreed because I didn\u2019t want to leave her alone. \nBut now things are great. They live 5 minutes away from my workplace, and for the first time I can just go home and not have to worry about who's passed out on the couch, if the doors are locked, how much my mom had to drink, or anything like that. I get to just have tea with my grandma, watch something funny, search for recipes to make, or even do some painting. There\u2019s always people at home and they listen to me, care about me, and it feels so good, because I don\u2019t even remember the last time I had that. They're really happy too, since I help with the bills, the house chores and keep them company. \n\nI\u2019ve talked to my uncle this week (mom\u2019s brother) and he said that to her it was just a fight and I'll come back in a few days. Last time it was the same thing, she called me after a couple days telling me to come back home, but this time I don't want to.\n\nIt's a horrible thing to admit, but I\u2019m happier without her. My uncle wasn\u2019t happy at all when I said that I don't intend to go back, and called me an asshole because to him, I should be there to support her through that. According to him, as my mother, she's my responsability, and I should help her. The thing is that I\u2019ve tried so many times throughout the years that at this point I'm just sick of it.

All she can offer you at this stage in her life is permanent mental health issues. She needs to seek treatment because that cycle of abuse will not end while she drinks.
