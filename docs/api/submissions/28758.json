In the original post you glanced over what exactly your finance did to help you get your start and you've also been together 8+ years so this isn't a new relationship. Your brother provided you a loan and assuming you paid him back and the college fund was in addition to that I can absolutely see where your wife is coming from. Your disregarding everything she did to help you become the success you are now and rewarding your brother for providing a loan. In one comment you said that you could have hired a someone 16k to do what she did, you also could have gotten a loan from a bank instead of your brother. You are complete disregarding all her contributions to helping you become successful, anyone can throw money at a problem when they have it time is more valuable than money in certain situations, did your brother do anything else other than write you a cheque? Did he invest time or effort?

I\u2019m thinking there is a vast difference in concept of investment and relationship here. Many couples engage in we thinking. As long and both are open and honest that\u2019s fine. There is a problem when you have a we and me person in a pair that is ambiguous about investment and expectations and doesn\u2019t communicate. Partners do more than cook and clean and advise. Rather than cast blame about the unspoken. I think you guys should do some couples therapy to work on communication and expectations. Lay this out with a professional. You have the financial privilege to invest in this. This is an 8 year relationship where one partner thought they were investing and supporting (and at the same time willingly taking in responsibilities and and trusting in their partner  while sacrificing their independence) and they other partner thought of it as a transaction. And that partner puts a value on their contributions at a rate less than the federal U.S. poverty standard. The nephew was an aside way to ask if you valued her contributions. She didn\u2019t ask for you to give up those college funds. She asked you to invest in her family. I hope you love her. I hope you do. I hope you love the partner you are about to marry. I hope she is as invaluable and priceless to you as you and your brother are to each other.

It would only be fair if her brother had gave you a loan as well. Did he? No? Then the situation is not the same. So setting up a fund for the nephew would be unfair, as his dad did not help you like your brother did. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHer attitude towards your business and money makes me think a pre-nup might be in order to protect your business and assets.", "\nI'm leaning towards NTA, but it sounds like your GF might have some unresolved financial resentment in some form.\n\nThey could either be the feeling that she 1, can't do what you're able to do for your family or 2, whatever her support/contributions were for you towards your business she feels she wasn't properly compensated.\n\nYour brother was VERY fortunate to be able to help you, and as you said you did something to pay him back that I'm sure he's extremely thankful for. However, I want to remind people that help in starting something as time-consuming as a business does not always equate to finances. That's why laws make employers pay for labor and why people will sue for rights to a business if they've done work but never received anything back.\n\nIn my opinion, I think you should look at her contribution/support towards your business as though you're assessing an employee/business partner or whatever you want to call it. If she was never compensated for actually helping you with it, it's safe to say she's probably a little hurt by it.\n\nWas she taking time to help you with actual work? Was she putting in hours to help you? Did she manage other things in your life/relationship so you could focus on growing your business? Or was she simply a shoulder to lean on and giving you encouragement?\n\nIf she was doing anything actively to help your business, I would suggest finding a fair dollar value to attach to that labor. Maybe have a neutral party help you do this, like a trusted employee at your business or something. Put it in writing and present it to her with the option that she can choose to have a fund set up for her nephew. This does NOT have to equal the amount you gave to your nieces unless the numbers work out that way.\n\nAfter that, I think you two do need to have a sit down about finances. Money is one of the biggest points of contention in relationships if you're planning on getting married to this woman (which given you've been together for nearly a decade this isn't some new relationship)  then it's a conversation that should be had before you two end up tying your assets together. It's a big web you'd end up having to untangle if you ended up splitting after marriage.\n\nEither way, you absolutely need to have a sit-down and discuss what is going on. I agree with your initial comment that any huge financial decisions, no matter who is making the purchase, should be discussed.\n\nThere are a lot of people in the comments saying she's displaying a \"huge red flag\" but you've given us no information about her and what she does other than she's hurt and would like to do something similar for her nephew. The decision to thank your brother by paying for your nieces' collage funds is great and that absolutely is not on her nor would it be on you if the situations were reversed, but just from the tiny bit you've given us it sounds like there's more going on.\n\nDon't equate her to being a greedy money-grubbing gold digger just yet, you've been with her a long time so you should know her fairly well by this point. You said you started your business 8yrs ago, and that she helped support you in getting it going so I'm assuming you've been together for at least as long as you've had this business. If she were just with you for your money, you would know by now and I'm sure your family would have said something to you.", "It's easy to dismiss the labors of someone else when they aren't attached to a monetary amount. While your wife was staying at home making your life run smoothly and giving you advice that helped your company succeed, she missed out on opportunities that could have meant she could give her nephew a college fund.\n\n(Plus if your brother could afford to give you such a large loan he probably can pay for his kid's college himself. Is that the same case for the nephew?)\n\nFinally, it's not just your money and you should have run such a big expenditure past her. She put her career on hold to support you.
