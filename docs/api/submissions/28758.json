You\u2019re not even married to this woman yet, you have no relation to her nephew - by blood or marriage at this point. \n\nThis is a thank you gift for your brothers family.", "Whoop whooop whooop. Hear that? Those are alarm bells.\n\nDefinitely NTA. Completely different circumstances.", "You\u2019re not married yet. Are you getting a prenuptial agreement?  How much did she help you with the business?  Is the business fully in your name?  I\u2019d say NTA.  I also wouldn\u2019t tell the nephew. He\u2019d probably feel left out.", "NTA, assuming her contributions weren't the same level as your brother's \n\nTell her you will pay for her nephew's college when the kid's parents help with money as well, and remind her that she is asking you to commit on a large investment for a branch of her family you're not even intimate with, unlike your **brother**. Different conditions, I don't know why she feels entitled to ask for this\n\nAlso, have you gotten a prenup?", "I don\u2019t get why she expects you to pay for her nephew. It\u2019s not like you asked her to pitch in for your nieces. Def NTA.", "Nta she does not get a say at this point, and you've told her it was specifically a thank you gift.", "Did she help contribute to your niece's college fund?\n\nNo, you say, shocking! \n\nWell, you got your answer contribute as much as she did for the niece's. NOT A DAMN THANG.\n\nNTA and I think what you are doing is a very nice thing for your brother and niece's!", "NTA I can\u2019t fathom why she thinks you should pay for her nephew\u2019s college. It sounds like you appreciate that you might not have the business without your brother\u2019s help and wanted to show that by helping the nieces you have known their entire lives.", "NTA - You\u2019re not married, you have no relationship or little relationship with her side of the family? She can absolutely start a college fund on her own\n\nPs: unless she worked for free for you for hours / weeks and months and was key factor in your success. Then she may deserve some equity or payout but that\u2019s for to do whatever she wants with", "NTA. Run while you can!", "For this particular issue, you\u2019re NTA.  But, it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 has some financial resentment with you that needs to be resolved.  It may be your money and you\u2019re not married yet, but you\u2019re in the process of transitioning towards marriage.  So, as you stand your ground on this, I ask that you also use this issue as an opportunity to respectfully discuss how you two can have a stronger mutual understanding with each other\u2019s finances  for now on. It\u2019s unbelievable how many engagements and marriages end over money\u2026.especially when businesses are involved.", "NTA......\n\nThis woman sounds pure greedy! You're not married to her and not related to her nephew and her nephews parents have not helped you in any way with your business. And I don't know for sure, but somehow I doubt that she freely helped you $45,000 worth of help when you got it started.\n\nAlso, if you ever marry this woman absolutely get a prenup!", "NTA. Only agree if she first pays for half of your nephews college funds. \n\nEverybody wins and you save some money.", "NTA. One think has nothing to do with the other! She can find her nephew\u2019s education herself", "NTA \n\nNot only was it a thank you, he is your brother and they are your bio neices.\n\nShe is not currently married to you, but wants you to start a college fund for *her* nephew?! \n\nAll things being equal, either she starts a college fund for her bio nephew OR you start one for him, and she matches the amount and puts it into your neices.\n\nBut I have a feeling neither will happen. So just nooooo.\n\nAnd maybe extend the engagement a bit", "NTA. And you should be considering a pre-nup.", "NTA\n\nShe can run the fund by herself like you did.\n\nFor compromise since she helped you start your business you can help for half.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you do get married, then you could decide to set up a fund for the child that would become your nephew through marriage.", "Nta\n\nYour brother took money that could have been used for his kids education and put it in your business. You\u2019re simply repaying him for that", "No I live in a place where premarital assets arent considered shared property", "Sounds like where I am from as well,  only what is earned or made in the marriage is taken into consideration.  \nStill a good idea to discuss big ticket items anyway."]}
