Some back story, my partners parents are homophobic and will not be attending our wedding. My mother had a liver transplant in 2021 after being extremely sick for a while.\n\nFlash-forward to this year and my fianc\u00e9e and I will be getting married in September. We will be sending out invitations in a few months and recently met with an invitation designer. My parents have been very gracious in helping pay for the wedding which I appreciate more than I can say. However, my partners parents are homophobic and have told him they will not be attending the wedding. They have also forbidden any out of town guests from staying with them or even visiting while they are here for the wedding. My partner has been very upset about this and decided to not send a save the date or invitation to his parents.\n\nMy parents have told me before that since they are paying for the wedding, they would like their names to go on them saying that they would \"request the attendance\" of guests at the wedding. They've said it's tradition and the right thing to do. As we were discussing the invitations, my fianc\u00e9e said how upset the situation with his parents has been making him. We spoke and decided it would be best to not put my parents names on the invitations for two reasons. 1. Since his parents are extremely hurtful when it comes to our relationship, they do not deserve to be on the invitations, especially since they will not be coming to the wedding and 2. Because we both agree it would be awkward to have one set of parents on the invitation and at the wedding. In other words, my fianc\u00e9e will have no parents at the wedding and will not get a first dance with mom, etc., already.\n\nHowever, my parents are very upset. They say I'm being hurtful by not having them on the invitations and that I should stand up for them to be on the invitations. However, they know the situation and I've told them that our invitation designer even said we shouldn't do the parents names given the situation.

They are effectively the \"hosts\" of the celebration. \n\nThat is why traditionally wedding invitations were issued by the brides family, since they were the ones paying.

Leaving your parents names off when they are paying for it is kinda rude. \n\n\nYour parents are giving you a huge amount of support both emotionally and financially. His family is not.

You could have just put your parent names on it.  I don't think anyone is 100% right or 100% wrong here because this is a sticky situation with his parents.

You should get the final say before anything is confirmed. \n\nWhile I agree that it would look odd with only one set of parent's names on the invites, I can't help but think the real issue would be the trauma your partner is currently feeling. I have interesting parents, and while I'm glad a lot of my friends don't, it's still sometimes hard to be the odd \"man\" out.

It is so much more joyful to have a wedding invitation that isn't just the two of you celebrating yourselves, but your parents saying, \"We want to invite everyone to help us celebrate as we welcome \\[partner\\] becoming spouses with our child!\" Let them do that, not for themselves but for you and him!
