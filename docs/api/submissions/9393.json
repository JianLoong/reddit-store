My parents have been very gracious in helping pay for the wedding which I appreciate more than I can say. However, my partners parents are homophobic and have told him they will not be attending the wedding. They have also forbidden any out of town guests from staying with them or even visiting while they are here for the wedding. My partner has been very upset about this and decided to not send a save the date or invitation to his parents.\n\nMy parents have told me before that since they are paying for the wedding, they would like their names to go on them saying that they would \"request the attendance\" of guests at the wedding. They've said it's tradition and the right thing to do. As we were discussing the invitations, my fianc\u00e9e said how upset the situation with his parents has been making him. We spoke and decided it would be best to not put my parents names on the invitations for two reasons. 1. Since his parents are extremely hurtful when it comes to our relationship, they do not deserve to be on the invitations, especially since they will not be coming to the wedding and 2. Because we both agree it would be awkward to have one set of parents on the invitation and at the wedding. In other words, my fianc\u00e9e will have no parents at the wedding and will not get a first dance with mom, etc., already.\n\nHowever, my parents are very upset. They say I'm being hurtful by not having them on the invitations and that I should stand up for them to be on the invitations.

They are effectively the \"hosts\" of the celebration. \n\nThat is why traditionally wedding invitations were issued by the brides family, since they were the ones paying.

Leaving your parents names off when they are paying for it is kinda rude. \n\n\nYour parents are giving you a huge amount of support both emotionally and financially. His family is not. You do not indicate any controlling actions on the part of your parents, they just want some public recognition for the contributions they made. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 parents have nothing to do with it.

It's your wedding and you can do as you please but I can understand why your parents would be hurt.

I would love to say I wish all parents were like my mom and in-laws who made no strings, but that's often rare.  As much as it sucks, if you want to make a stand, don't accept the money.   You could have just put your parent names on it.  I don't think anyone is 100% right or 100% wrong here because this is a sticky situation with his parents.

This is much better than many people in your situation in which they won't attend/pay/or ban you from existence.  \n\nYou have the option to not accept their money but you don't want to because it would make things harder for you.  Simply put you are being entitled.  Anyone saying NTA is simply saying it because they dislike the parents.

Otherwise, pay for your own wedding/pay them back! \n\nIt\u2019s not awkward to put the hosts names at all and very common. \n\nI don\u2019t understand why you can feel okay accepting the money WITH the strings attached.

You should get the final say before anything is confirmed. \n\nWhile I agree that it would look odd with only one set of parent's names on the invites, I can't help but think the real issue would be the trauma your partner is currently feeling. I have interesting parents, and while I'm glad a lot of my friends don't, it's still sometimes hard to be the odd \"man\" out. Potentially seeing just your parents names, and not his because his parents don't accept him for who he is, could be triggering. \n\nI would explain this to your parents, with full knowledge they may revoke helping you pay for the wedding. \n\nGood luck, and congratulations.

But it is your wedding.", "That's pretty standard stuff to have on an invitation tbh. I wouldn't say it's weird to have your parents on the invitation and not you partner's.

It's about the opportunity to avoid ugliness by allowing your parents to welcome your partner into the family . . . to have invitations that show that at least one set of parents are celebrating the two of you as a couple, openly and warmly.  It is so much more joyful to have a wedding invitation that isn't just the two of you celebrating yourselves, but your parents saying, \"We want to invite everyone to help us celebrate as we welcome \\[partner\\] becoming spouses with our child!\" Let them do that, not for themselves but for you and him!
