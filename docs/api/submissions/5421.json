I have a friend who is white and her husband is Japanese, and their kids look a lot like her husband.  She used to always get asked if they were adopted from China.  Different situation, but people need to get through their heads the concept of inter-racial couples or exercise the option that is always available - keep their mouths shut.", "NTA there are plenty of reasons why kids sometimes don\u2019t look like their parents. The kids weren\u2019t fighting you, you weren\u2019t aggressively trying to leave with them, or anything that could even possibly suggest you were kidnapping them. She was being a nosy busybody and was upset to be called out. Your and the children\u2019s safety should always be the priority over someone else possible feelings like that.", "Your sister in law said you overreacted to a woman following you and your kids around because your kids don't look like you?

Really, how will people learn their behavior is unacceptable if not confronted. Hopefully she will think twice and not think skin/hair/eye color is a reason to doubt legitimacy. Not only are mixed children any and all colors of the rainbow, fostering and adoption is a thing.", "NTA.\n\nThat lady has no business following you around. She is the one who is creepy and appearing like a stalker or a kidnapper.\n\nShe first started awing your kids and making them awkward, then following you guys around.\nThe right conclusion is potential kidnapper and to inform the authorities. Her crying is just pretending to be innocent. She deserves learning the lesson of not stalking innocent families. \n\nThe amount of stress she received is much lower than the amount of stress she gave.", "NTA, but your SIL is a major one.

The old lady was scaring you by skulking around after you.", "NTA\n\nMaybe she has an argument for thinking your kids were in danger if they really don\u2019t look like you and they were acting shy and you hurried them away.  But the response to that is to do what *you* did and alert an employee.  By stalking you around the store, she made *you* feel unsafe.", "NTA. She could have caused a lot of trouble if she acted on her (unfounded) allegations, and there's never an excuse to menace a mother and her children in a public space (yes, whether she was intending to or not, following a family around in a store is menacing them). \nOld lady sounds well-meaning and racist.", "NTA. Your SIL is wrong. You\u2019ve received threats and insults from racists before. You did not overreact. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with ignorance and racism.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t over react. That old woman was working up to calling the cops on the scary dark-haired which who had stolen the pure white children. If she was telling the truth, that\u2019s the only logical conclusion.

So it\u2019s fine for her to scare you and make your kids uncomfortable but not ok for you to report her and cause her \u201cstress\u201d?
