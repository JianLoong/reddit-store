It was pretty weird to follow you around and made you uncomfortable\u2014and it probably creeped out the kids too! She was embarrassed and trying to cover for her weird behavior. SIL\u2026.might not be the person to ever talk about this to. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "What the hell?  NTA.  The woman confirmed that she was borderline harassing you.  You alerted the store, so you could feel safe.  Sorry you had to deal with this, and that your SIL was unsupportive.  I have a friend who is white and her husband is Japanese, and their kids look a lot like her husband.  She used to always get asked if they were adopted from China.  Different situation, but people need to get through their heads the concept of inter-racial couples or exercise the option that is always available - keep their mouths shut.", "NTA there are plenty of reasons why kids sometimes don\u2019t look like their parents. The kids weren\u2019t fighting you, you weren\u2019t aggressively trying to leave with them, or anything that could even possibly suggest you were kidnapping them. She was being a nosy busybody and was upset to be called out. Your and the children\u2019s safety should always be the priority over someone else possible feelings like that.", "Your sister in law said you overreacted to a woman following you and your kids around because your kids don't look like you? What in the bigoted fuck family did you marry into? I'm assuming your husband is not like that since he was the one who told you alert someone when this happens. NTA.", "NTA but your SIL is. She doesn\u2019t have to walk a day in your shoe and will never come close to understanding your experience!", "NTA the other lady is a freak you were just looking out for the kids", "NTA - That lady was a big AH. If you scared her, good, hopefully it taught her something. It really doesn\u2019t matter if your kids look like you or not, it\u2019s absolutely none of her business.", "NTA. Really, how will people learn their behavior is unacceptable if not confronted. Hopefully she will think twice and not think skin/hair/eye color is a reason to doubt legitimacy. Not only are mixed children any and all colors of the rainbow, fostering and adoption is a thing.", "NTA.\n\nThat lady has no business following you around. She is the one who is creepy and appearing like a stalker or a kidnapper.\n\nShe first started awing your kids and making them awkward, then following you guys around.\nThe right conclusion is potential kidnapper and to inform the authorities. Her crying is just pretending to be innocent. She deserves learning the lesson of not stalking innocent families. \n\nThe amount of stress she received is much lower than the amount of stress she gave.", "NTA, but your SIL is a major one. You didn't scare an old lady, you protected yourself and your children. But for your SIL to defend someone for reminding you that your kids don't resemble you is unnecessary.", "NTA. She didn't know if you were their mom or not? How is that not EVERY stranger with a child she sees???", "NTA, but damn your SIL is as well as the elderly lady.", "NTA \n\nIn the slightest.", "NTA. She is a racist.", "NTA. You can't be too careful with your kids. This world has gotten crazy lately.  If she truly was concerned what the heck was she going to do anyway??", "OMG.  NTA and I'm sorry you experienced this.   I find it comical that the older woman felt justified in worrying about your kids for no valid reason,  but feels SHE is the victim.   Your SIL also lacks empathy.\n\nGiven what's going in the world these days, you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNExt time, call the police", "NTA. The old lady put on quite a show when she got caught. You can't be too cautious about strangers following you around. You did the right thing getting those employees to help you. Who knows what she might have tried to do.", "Hell no you are NTA! She didn\u2019t like getting called out on her own bulls**t. Maybe now she will learn to mind her own damn business.", "Lady crying because she is a shitty person, checks out", "NTA. Lots of people don't look like their kids. The old lady was scaring you by skulking around after you.", "NTA\n\nMaybe she has an argument for thinking your kids were in danger if they really don\u2019t look like you and they were acting shy and you hurried them away.  But the response to that is to do what *you* did and alert an employee.  By stalking you around the store, she made *you* feel unsafe.", "NTA. She could have caused a lot of trouble if she acted on her (unfounded) allegations, and there's never an excuse to menace a mother and her children in a public space (yes, whether she was intending to or not, following a family around in a store is menacing them). \nOld lady sounds well-meaning and racist.", "NTA. Your SIL is wrong. You\u2019ve received threats and insults from racists before. You did not overreact. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with ignorance and racism.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t over react. That old woman was working up to calling the cops on the scary dark-haired which who had stolen the pure white children. If she was telling the truth, that\u2019s the only logical conclusion. She used her age and her perceived frailty combined as a weapon to threaten you with \u201csomething happening\u201d and telling you that you\u2019d better be sorry. \n\nYou did right.", "NTA the old lady might have had the best intentions but she was making your kids and you uncomfortable and she needed to know that. Kids often don't look like one or either parent and even if you live in an all white town they don't get to assume without repercussions.", "NTA.  So it\u2019s fine for her to scare you and make your kids uncomfortable but not ok for you to report her and cause her \u201cstress\u201d?  She\u2019s a bigot, she got called out, and she didn\u2019t like it.  Hopefully she\u2019ll learn her lesson.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your kids look nothing like you so that means other people get to stare at you in public and make you uncomfortable? I don\u2019t think so. There are so many reasons for an adult to be out with children they don\u2019t look like. Kids could be adopted or in foster care, the adult could be a babysitter, the adult could be a relative of the kids but not their parent, kids could inherit more visible genes from one parent and look less like the other. So many perfectly reasonable explanations. This lady, and anyone else who treats you this way, have no business acting this way. Your kids were obviously not in danger or acting scared and they were willingly following you in the store.

In defending the old woman she has implicitly stated that she feels like non-white adults in the presence of white or white-passing children are dangerous interlopers until proven otherwise.\n\nPeople don\u2019t generally do this to a white parent who otherwise doesn\u2019t resemble their white children \u2014 especially a mother.

The daughter was her niece and she and her husband adopted her after some trouble. I know she gets harassed all the time over the difference in color, because she talks about it. Yes, that woman in the store was racist. And maybe your sister in law who took the stalker's side is racist. We are a mixed race world and people who do this, or feel that only one color may adopt another color, or sympathize with those that get called out on this instead of those that get stalked need to take a long look at themselves.", "Nta.

Absolutely NONE of that mattered to that nosy old woman because she felt entitled to be racist. Tell your SIL to lick paint and your husband is 100% correct.

My wife and I nannied 3 kids when we were in our early/mid 20s (the oldest kid was 14). We ended up going to Wal-Mart with them once or twice.
