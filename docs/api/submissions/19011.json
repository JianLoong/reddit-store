This mum was obviously unaware that SIL was telling people something else. \n\nFor the rest of the party, whenever I was mingling and anyone brought up something along the lines of \"shame BIL is working\", I immediately corrected them and told them where he actually was. The rest of the party went fine, but I later got an angry phone call from my ex who who told me I had \"blabbed\" to SILs boss about things, and how they were \"disappointed \"in their parental priorities.
