That title gets earned. It\u2019s up to you. I didn\u2019t even use Stepmother.

It sounds like your dads put in the work with your two boys. Your step mom hasn\u2019t put the work in yet.", "Sweetheart, I'm a stepmum and you haven't done ANYTHING wrong.  I have known my step son for over 10 years. His Mum is alive and he lives with her during the school term. He calls me by my first name (I told him it's his choice and there is no pressure) and I don't feel any less loved. \n\nThat's a special title and it's YOUR choice who you give it to. Definitely NTA.", "NTA.\nYour stepmother is behaving entitled and trying to foist a closer relationship on you. You have a mom and would prefer not to call her by that title. That should be that. If you feel so inclined you could have a nickname for you that's special. Dump this problem on your father if she keeps pushing.", "Nta and your SM sounds like a loon", "NTA.

NTA. \n\nMy fathers father (my grandfather) remarried back in the early 90s and my father never saw (fake names) Joe's wife, Mary, as his mother or a mother figure.

The grandkids in both sides call them Grandpa/grandma+first name (so \"grandpa Joe\")\n\nOther friends of mine who married when kids were still young and still at home, all had grownup conversation with the kids in what to call the other parent. They all found solutions that worked *for them* like papa or papa+first name if they already use dad for their bio dad.", "NTA\n\nShe can\u2019t demand that you call her mom.

You call her whatever you feel appropriate, not whatever she wrongly thinks she's entitled to.", "Lol NTA\n\nShe isn't the one who makes that decision. You are. Your mom is still around from the sounds of it so why tf would you call this woman mom?\n\nTell your dad have his new wife knock it off and that it's not appreciated.", "NTA at all. Calling someone Mom is incredibly personal. You sound lovely and genuine. She is being immature, selfish and really thoughtless - not like a good mom would act. It\u2019s her job to get to know and understand you, that is the responsibility that she has taken on. She shouldn\u2019t have asked you.", "NTA.\n\nMom, mum, mommy mother etc are a title to be earned not demanded. \n\nStepmom clearly hasn\u2019t earned that title given her behavior", "NTA\n\n>I should call her mom because she feels like she is my mom.\n\nFunny how she's allowed to \"feel\" and express what she wants, but you aren't.

The situation is not the same as for your step-brothers. It's up to you whether you want to call her mom or not. It not something that's required or that comes on demand.

He's really nice, he's just not really a father figure to me. \n\nHint that he's really nice: He's told me he'd like it if I called him dad but only if I wanted to and meant it. He said it once.
