{"id": 2109, "submission_id": "yt4euo", "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter her father's last name?", "selftext": "I'm going to keep the background information to the facts as much as possible:\n\nI (33f) have a daughter (4f) with my ex-partner (33m). The pregnancy was unplanned and happened despite using contraception. We spoke about what we wanted to do, and he was clear he didn't want to be involved. While I'd never really considered having children, actually being pregnant changed my mind and I decided I'd like to keep my baby.\n\nWe parted on *not horrendous terms.* I obviously wasn't happy about becoming a single parent, but I respected his decision. My ex-partner was not involved in the pregnancy or the birth, or the first six months of our daughter's life.\n\nHe then had a car accident which I won't go into, but it changed his view on things. He sought me out and asked if he could be involved in his daughter's life. It was very difficult at first. I had just struggled through pregnancy, birth, and taking care of a newborn alone, so I wasn't thrilled he'd just waltzed back in. But I wanted my daughter to know her father, so agreed to let him see her.\n\nHe was genuinely remorseful and has, from that point onwards, been a fantastic father. He contributes financially and emotionally and shares half of all the parenting duties (dropping her off at school, picking her up, looking after her when she's poorly etc). We now have a good custody agreement (a legal agreement, we didn't go to court but we did speak to solicitors to have an agreement written up), with our daughter spending about 60% of her time with me versus about 40% with him. Things between us are good (we aren't together romantically, but we're on very good terms), and our daughter is happy, which is the key thing for both of us.\n\nRecently he's asked me if I'd consider changing our daughter's last name to his (right now, she has my last name).\n\nI said no. I tried to be nice about it, but I'm the one who grew and gave birth to her with no support from him. He was not involved in that part of her life at all, and I don't feel comfortable changing her name to his for a few reasons.\n\nFor one thing, she's very young, and I think it would be confusing to her at this point to change her name, especially as she's just started school, and secondly, it could cause issues for me if I don't share my daughter's last name.\n\nI said I'd be happy to consider double-barrelling our names, as he has proved himself to be a fantastic father, but that I wasn't changing it to solely his name. I also told him we could give her the choice of choosing his name if she'd like to when she's older. (We're British, so the custom is for children to take their father's name).\n\nI spoke to my parents about this expecting them to be on my side, but they both made it clear they think I should change her name and that I'm being unreasonable because it's normal for children to have their father's name.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668252343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt4euo/aita_for_not_giving_my_daughter_her_fathers_last/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In the past it was also tradition that the woman took her husband's name so therefore the child still had the mother's name. It is not tradition for the father to piss off for months and then come back demanding stuff.

NTA", "NTA- trust me, it WILL cause damage to your daughter. I studied early childhood development and names are VERY important when it comes to self-esteem and identity. Your daughters name makes her who she is, it\u2019s now part of her identity. If you were to change it, it would confuse her and damage her self-esteem, trust me. If she was only a few months old, it would be different, but she\u2019s 4 now. It would cause her to not know who she is anymore and will scare her somewhat. I cannot stress this enough, DO NOT CHANGE HER NAME!", "Love how your parents say it\u2019s normal for children to have their fathers last name, it\u2019s also normal to not have your father walk out on you even before your born. OP you are completely NTA here, even though he has come back into your daughters life it was only because of a car accident that he did so. imagine he never was in it, I very much think you would still be raising her by yourself. You\u2019re correct in stating your went through your pregnancy, birth and the struggle of being a single parent for 6 months most certainly deserves your daughter having your last night", "NTA. Double-barrelled is a perfectly reasonable compromise. And your parents are ridiculous.

Is zero benefit to your daughter to change her name. Your ex partner bailed at the beginning, and changed his mind after a potentially life altering event. It\u2019s good that he\u2019s in her life. The offer to hyphenate is generous. Plus to change it now may be confusing to her. Give HER the option when she\u2019s a bit older.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in similar circumstances to your daughter and have my mother's last name. It made sense since she was my primary caregiver. It's also great of you to offer to use both names which is a good compromise but in no way did you have to offer that. He shot the idea down, so that would be the end of the conversation for me if I were in your shoes. If your daughter decides she wants his name when she's older then that should be solely her decision.", "NTA. A good compromise would be to just give her both last names. Is that acceptable in your culture?", "NTA for both of your reasons.", "NTA, at all. \n\nIt is great he stepped up. It is great that you two are coparenting so well. You happily agreed to give your child both names. \n\nYou should not be expected to just *drop* your own last name from their name tho. That is completely unfair, and kind of a slap in the face to all of the solo work you put in to parenting before he had his change of heart. \n\nSidenote tho: aside from this current issue, it's GREAT to see parents working together to coparent like this. I've seen the opposite too many times, your child is very lucky & by the sounds of it, very loved.", "NTA. Nope, don\u2019t change it. Let her make that decision for herself when she\u2019s an adult.", "NTA. Look, it'd be different if while you were pregnant, even if he didn't want to be a father, he put himself on the birth certificate and acknowledged that he was a parent. He didn't. He yeeted himself off to go live a happy child-free existence without you, even though he knew he was a bio father. Ask yourself this; if he hadn't had his accident, do you think he'd be there now? Probably not. He had a life/death situation that made him reevaluate what was important and he fortunately figured out he should try to do right by his child. Great for him. But he wasn't there when you were pregnant and vulnerable, or giving birth and vulnerable, or the first six months when you were likely running on zombie and panic mode. If he'd wanted her to have his last name, he should have stepped up when naming her was happening, not after the fact. \n\nWe call this a consequence of actions. Not being married has nothing to do with this. If you'd been married and opted to give her your maiden name if you also opted to revert to it after a divorce and he came back in later and demanded it changed, I'd say the same thing. And the fact that he's being a grumpy sulker about it proves my point. He wants some kind of controlling claim on her. He wants to be the one in control, just like he was when he left. He hasn't earned that. And frankly, at this point, it's her decision to make. If she gets older, maybe she'll ask you to change it. Maybe she'll be old enough to change it herself. Maybe she won't. But he's getting hung up over the wrong thing. \n\n\"You're upset she doesn't have your name. That's because it's a constant reminder that you bailed when we both needed you most. Maybe you need to talk to someone about it because this all sounds like a you problem and not an us or me problem.\"", "NTA. You did all the work before and around the time of naming. You also gave a very good reason (it can cause issues have different last names) as to why you don\u2019t want to change it. You shouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy partner and I are together (happily I think) and I insisted on double-barrelling so that both names were there as opposed to one or the other. Had I done it alone like you did, I\u2019d have done exactly the same as you and wouldn\u2019t change.", "NTA and don't back down just because people are telling you it's \"normal\".\n\nYou grew her, you birthed her, you *named* her,  alone. You still have her more than 50% of the time. It is likely to cause annoyances for you if you don't share a last name. \n\nPlus there's little to stop him bailing again. My friend has the last name of a father who did a vanishing act when she was 10. She resents it and would change it if it wouldn't be a whole load of effort professionally/practically.\n\nDouble barrelling is more than reasonable.", "Don\u2019t do it. \nMe end my ex split when my little one was 6 months old he\u2019s now 5 and I really really regret my son not having my last name or at least having my last name too, I\u2019m not going to change it because now he\u2019s an actual person and not just an idea and I think it should be his choice but I do regret it.  \nI\u2019m British too btw \nNTA", "NTA don't do it", "INFO: How did the father react when you said you didn\u2019t want to change her name?", "NTA and if he keeps pushing then consider going back to the solicitor\u2019s and making him legally GTFBO", "NTA", "NTA. You are being reasonable but your parents aren't.", "Don\u2019t ever let people tell you what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d.

You gave great alternatives and your reasons for not changing it right now are perfectly reasonable", "NTA, her name was chosen at a time when you had to do everything alone. It's great that he is a good father now and hopefully he will always be. \nWhy should you change her name? I think it's very strange that it's normal to give a child the name of the father, but hey, that's tradition. But I certainly wouldn't suddenly change her name right now.\nIf she did have his name and you would now suddenly want to change her name to your last name, I would have advised against that too.\n\nI would, if possible, look into a double surname  (when she's older) or wait until she is old enough to decide for herself (at 18).", "Nope NTA\n\nYou offered a viable compromise, which was the double barreling your names and since you arent married, that seems excellent, as that way your daughter has both your names and can choose to keep it that way or take on just one or the other when she is an adult.\n\nYour parents are from an older generation where the 'nuclear family traditions' were in place, hence their belief that you should name your child after her father. Those values arent the 'norm' now.\n\nHopefully her father can understand the compromise and accept it. The important thing is to BE the father, which it sounds like he is doing.", "NTA. I wouldn't change your daughters name to his even if he has been a great father lately.", "NTA. Double-barrel is a perfectly reasonable compromise, which you weren't obliged to offer in the first place. Any reasons he might have to want your daughter to have his name are equally valid if we reverse it to you and your name.", "NTA \n\nyou carried her for 9 months and was responsible for 4 years of her life, that\u2019s still 4 years that he missed out on.\n\nHe should be very thankful that you allowed him to be part of your daughters life after he said he wanted nothing to do with her. \n\nStand your ground op, I would not even consider a double barrel name if I were you. If he was there from the beginning it would be different but he wasn\u2019t.", "NTA bc of your own reasona he left and bc of that she has your name, also you live in the same household.", ">he was clear he didn't want to be involved.\n\nHe made his choice when you became pregnant and has to live with that decision.\n\n>I'd be happy to consider double-barrelling our names\n\nThis is a great compromise, one he should settle for. \n\n>I also told him we could give her the choice of choosing his name if she'd like to when she's older.\n\nAnother good option. \n\nYour parents opinions don't matter, yours does. He wasn't there for you when you needed him. He only changed his mind because he realized life is short and anything can happen.

Youre give a valid options and you are you reasons to doit.\nYoure a good mom.", "NAH, besides your parents. Your ex can ask but your reasons for not changing her name make the most sense.

After all, it's not YOUR name, it is HERS.  So this isn't a decision that should me made by father (alone), mother (alone) or even parents (without input from daughter).  Considering her age, I think the best thing is you have one vote, father has one vote and daughter also has one full vote.   2 out of 3 decides the issue.  Oh, and it would only be \"confusing\" for her if you did it without discussing it with her and asking her opinion, first.  But to be fair, both you and the father should discuss it with her.  (You both have a chance to explain to her your feeling on the issue)\n\nOh, and it's not going to cause \"issues\" for you if her name is changed.  Approach any 100 random women in a shopping mall who have children.  Ask them their names.  If you can find one family where the woman gave birth to more than one child and all the human beings have the same last name?  You'd better buy a lottery ticket...\n\nThese days, it's more likely the mom will have a different last name than it is for her to have the SAME last name as all of her children.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
