{"id": 2109, "submission_id": "yt4euo", "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter her father's last name?", "selftext": "I'm going to keep the background information to the facts as much as possible:\n\nI (33f) have a daughter (4f) with my ex-partner (33m). The pregnancy was unplanned and happened despite using contraception. We spoke about what we wanted to do, and he was clear he didn't want to be involved. While I'd never really considered having children, actually being pregnant changed my mind and I decided I'd like to keep my baby.\n\nWe parted on *not horrendous terms.* I obviously wasn't happy about becoming a single parent, but I respected his decision. My ex-partner was not involved in the pregnancy or the birth, or the first six months of our daughter's life.\n\nHe then had a car accident which I won't go into, but it changed his view on things. He sought me out and asked if he could be involved in his daughter's life. It was very difficult at first. I had just struggled through pregnancy, birth, and taking care of a newborn alone, so I wasn't thrilled he'd just waltzed back in. But I wanted my daughter to know her father, so agreed to let him see her.\n\nHe was genuinely remorseful and has, from that point onwards, been a fantastic father. He contributes financially and emotionally and shares half of all the parenting duties (dropping her off at school, picking her up, looking after her when she's poorly etc). We now have a good custody agreement (a legal agreement, we didn't go to court but we did speak to solicitors to have an agreement written up), with our daughter spending about 60% of her time with me versus about 40% with him. Things between us are good (we aren't together romantically, but we're on very good terms), and our daughter is happy, which is the key thing for both of us.\n\nRecently he's asked me if I'd consider changing our daughter's last name to his (right now, she has my last name).\n\nI said no. I tried to be nice about it, but I'm the one who grew and gave birth to her with no support from him. He was not involved in that part of her life at all, and I don't feel comfortable changing her name to his for a few reasons.\n\nFor one thing, she's very young, and I think it would be confusing to her at this point to change her name, especially as she's just started school, and secondly, it could cause issues for me if I don't share my daughter's last name.\n\nI said I'd be happy to consider double-barrelling our names, as he has proved himself to be a fantastic father, but that I wasn't changing it to solely his name. I also told him we could give her the choice of choosing his name if she'd like to when she's older. (We're British, so the custom is for children to take their father's name).\n\nI spoke to my parents about this expecting them to be on my side, but they both made it clear they think I should change her name and that I'm being unreasonable because it's normal for children to have their father's name.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668252343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt4euo/aita_for_not_giving_my_daughter_her_fathers_last/", "score": 3024, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Double-barrelled is a perfectly reasonable compromise. And your parents are ridiculous.

It's also great of you to offer to use both names which is a good compromise but in no way did you have to offer that. He shot the idea down, so that would be the end of the conversation for me if I were in your shoes. If your daughter decides she wants his name when she's older then that should be solely her decision.", "NTA. A good compromise would be to just give her both last names. Is that acceptable in your culture?", "NTA for both of your reasons.", "NTA, at all. \n\nIt is great he stepped up. It is great that you two are coparenting so well. You happily agreed to give your child both names. \n\nYou should not be expected to just *drop* your own last name from their name tho. That is completely unfair, and kind of a slap in the face to all of the solo work you put in to parenting before he had his change of heart. \n\nSidenote tho: aside from this current issue, it's GREAT to see parents working together to coparent like this. I've seen the opposite too many times, your child is very lucky & by the sounds of it, very loved.", "NTA. Nope, don\u2019t change it. Let her make that decision for herself when she\u2019s an adult.", "NTA. Look, it'd be different if while you were pregnant, even if he didn't want to be a father, he put himself on the birth certificate and acknowledged that he was a parent. He didn't. He yeeted himself off to go live a happy child-free existence without you, even though he knew he was a bio father. Ask yourself this; if he hadn't had his accident, do you think he'd be there now? Probably not. He had a life/death situation that made him reevaluate what was important and he fortunately figured out he should try to do right by his child. Great for him. But he wasn't there when you were pregnant and vulnerable, or giving birth and vulnerable, or the first six months when you were likely running on zombie and panic mode. If he'd wanted her to have his last name, he should have stepped up when naming her was happening, not after the fact. \n\nWe call this a consequence of actions. Not being married has nothing to do with this. If you'd been married and opted to give her your maiden name if you also opted to revert to it after a divorce and he came back in later and demanded it changed, I'd say the same thing. And the fact that he's being a grumpy sulker about it proves my point. He wants some kind of controlling claim on her. He wants to be the one in control, just like he was when he left. He hasn't earned that. And frankly, at this point, it's her decision to make. If she gets older, maybe she'll ask you to change it. Maybe she'll be old enough to change it herself. Maybe she won't. But he's getting hung up over the wrong thing. \n\n\"You're upset she doesn't have your name. That's because it's a constant reminder that you bailed when we both needed you most. Maybe you need to talk to someone about it because this all sounds like a you problem and not an us or me problem.\"", "NTA. You did all the work before and around the time of naming. You also gave a very good reason (it can cause issues have different last names) as to why you don\u2019t want to change it. You shouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy partner and I are together (happily I think) and I insisted on double-barrelling so that both names were there as opposed to one or the other. Had I done it alone like you did, I\u2019d have done exactly the same as you and wouldn\u2019t change.", "NTA and don't back down just because people are telling you it's \"normal\".\n\nYou grew her, you birthed her, you *named* her,  alone. You still have her more than 50% of the time. It is likely to cause annoyances for you if you don't share a last name. \n\nPlus there's little to stop him bailing again. My friend has the last name of a father who did a vanishing act when she was 10. She resents it and would change it if it wouldn't be a whole load of effort professionally/practically.\n\nDouble barrelling is more than reasonable.", "Don\u2019t do it. \nMe end my ex split when my little one was 6 months old he\u2019s now 5 and I really really regret my son not having my last name or at least having my last name too, I\u2019m not going to change it because now he\u2019s an actual person and not just an idea and I think it should be his choice but I do regret it.  \nI\u2019m British too btw \nNTA", "NTA don't do it", "INFO: How did the father react when you said you didn\u2019t want to change her name?", "NTA and if he keeps pushing then consider going back to the solicitor\u2019s and making him legally GTFBO", "NTA", "NTA.

Those values arent the 'norm' now.\n\nHopefully her father can understand the compromise and accept it. The important thing is to BE the father, which it sounds like he is doing.", "NTA.

After all, it's not YOUR name, it is HERS.  So this isn't a decision that should me made by father (alone), mother (alone) or even parents (without input from daughter).  Considering her age, I think the best thing is you have one vote, father has one vote and daughter also has one full vote.   2 out of 3 decides the issue.  Oh, and it would only be \"confusing\" for her if you did it without discussing it with her and asking her opinion, first.  But to be fair, both you and the father should discuss it with her.  (You both have a chance to explain to her your feeling on the issue)\n\nOh, and it's not going to cause \"issues\" for you if her name is changed.  Approach any 100 random women in a shopping mall who have children.  Ask them their names.  If you can find one family where the woman gave birth to more than one child and all the human beings have the same last name?

I am glad he has been a good father, but I would personal think he threw tradition out the door on requesting last names when he first left.  The two of you co-parents, not got back together.  For the fact that you offered what you did on possible last name changes is commendable in my opinion.\n\nIs the only reason he wants the name change for tradition or to try to erase the last solid evidence that he was not their for the two of you during the pregnancy & birth? If it is a bit a both, I think he needs to get over it.  That time was lost and to just change it now would also gloss over what you had to go through.  There are always consequences for actions even after amends have been made.  Again I respect that you would be ok with double-barreling both last names for her, or let her deiced later on if life if she wants to change her last name.

That's not your circumstance. There is no tradition here. \nAlso - if he has a 'bad' last name - don't do it. The last name Butts is not something a 6yo should have to go through.", "Yep. NTA OP. The baby is named. That's it. He's doing great now and I applaud that, but he's shown up after the cake was mixed, baked,  iced, and served. Now he wants the icing changed? Nah.", "Ah yes! I often hear arguments like \"Family should share their last name\" as pressure and an excuse.\nSo, 2/3 of his family already has a last name, he can join himself in lol", "My neighbor recently posted a meme: Tradition is just peer pressure from dead people.", "You're thinking of Spain.", "I\u2019m betting he was involved in his daughter\u2019s life from birth, though.", "He\u2019s embarrassed now that he bailed on parenthood and left you to do the hard labor/infant stage by yourself. \n\nThe fact that the kid doesn\u2019t bear his name is a constant reminder of how he wasn\u2019t there for her in the beginning. And the reminder makes him uncomfortable. He thinks he\u2019ll be able to forget if he can paper over that absence by changing her last name.", "Too bad, because that's the most that he deserves. Hyphenating.", "Robin Hobb?", "Not exactly true, when they share a last name in the US. \n\nTechnically it's supposed to be questioned but if the child shares a last name with both adults traveling with them in the US. It's assumed they are a family unit. \n\nIf it's just one parent that shares the last name they will get questioned. \n\nI had full custody of my kids. My divorce was done correctly and I was able to obtain their passports without any interference from my ex. He did not have the same rights. I had to write a notarized letter to allow him to take them our of the country without me. \n\nBut because they shared his last name, and the last name if his new wife, they never had to produce that letter. \n\nMy kids were older by that point (15 and 13) and were never asked if they were with their parents. \n\nIt bothered me alot because, although my situation was fine, there are many that are not.", "My mom kept her maiden name, my parents are divorced, as a child we traveled internationally with no issues even with different last names. I think it depends. Some people make it a big deal and some people don\u2019t care", "I don\u2019t mean change their system to stop checking, I mean rely on something other than matching last names. If a non-custodial parent with the same last name flees with a child via plane they won\u2019t get caught if all they are looking at is names. Some airports require every parent to bring a letter from the other parent if you travel alone with your kid\u2026not the best solution but it\u2019s better than just checking last names. Maybe it\u2019s time to use all this technology we have to get approval\u2026like when you check in it pings the other parent and they approve\u2026something like that, I dunno.", "I know here in Europe, due to increased awareness of child trafficking there are more checks. Which is great for safety, but can make people uncomfortable to be challenged.", "Yeah I\u2019m sure we would\u2019ve been fine with it too. Especially since we\u2019re in a pretty heavy area for trafficking in the US", "NTA. Exact same thing happened to me and my daughter has my last name. Stick to your guns.", "NTA but I would always leave the option. I had my mother's name when I was born and had to wait till I turned 18 to switch to my father's last name because she refused to sign the papers. Don't be that person and don't be offended if that's what they choose.", "Nta \u2026 yeah he\u2019s a good father but whatever even about who did what first , why should you have to give up you sharing your last name with your daughter . It doesn\u2019t make sense unless all of you had the same last name . Or you were with him . Your coparenting . If your fine with hyphenating your a Saint but I wouldn\u2019t go farther than that .", "Absolutely. DON\u2019T second guess yourself.", "Said it better than I could. You\u2019re the main parent; your girl should have your last name. It\u2019s your choice now and hers when she\u2019s older. Nobody else\u2019s.", "This! This! A thousand times this! NTA", "I should unblock my biological father to send him this. He was pissed that when he finally had to start paying child support when I was 5, I didn't have his last name. He was still pissed about it when I finally met him at 17, he bitched about it the entire time. His only consolation was \"I'll be married soon so I'll change it anyways.\" Now I will die with MY last name as my final act of spite. Suck it Steven!", "Hyphened last namer here chiming in to say YWBTA if you doubled her last name. It\u2019s a bureaucratic nightmare, it\u2019s clunky, ugly, annoying and she will resent you for this. One name. Yours.", "Traditions change but this one hasn\u2019t. So that\u2019s not a valid defense.", "Same! And it makes me so happy to see others who have done the same. We\u2019re the only family I know IRL who has done things this way and it fills me with joy to see you all here!", "I have a different last name than my kids, and it's never caused a problem. Of course, I also live in a town with more deer than humans, so there's that. We have less than 1k people; less than 15k in the whole county.", "Exactly \u2764\ufe0f", "NIGHTEYES!!!", "Same for my son! \n\nI carried the little dude for 9 months and did all the work, thought I deserved to share his last name just a little more as a reward for all that. Plus, my last name is objectively prettier and very rare so hubby happily agreed. Also because he's not a misogynistic sexist who buys into the myth that the child should have the father's last name, just because he's a man.", "> as a child we traveled internationally with no issues \n\nPre- or post- 9/11? \n\nPre- or post The Hague Convention?\n\nBecause I can tell you that travel with children has really changed.", "Exactly. Dude put in a few mLs and 10 minutes of effort, then nothing for 15 months.\n\nIt doesn't matter if they've been 60/40 since.\n\nThose 15 months were when the naming happened.", "Because he's 'the man' and it's 'tradition'.\n\nIt's so ridiculous how a lot of people still blindly give a kid the father's last name *just* because he's the male parental figure. So sexist.", "PLEASE tell us you pointed out to him that you\u2019re under no obligation to take your husband\u2019s name.  Please please please.  \ud83d\ude08", "My daughter is 2. I just married her father. I had issues taking her to appointments nearly every time including the hospital i gave birth at.", "Traveled outside the country with her all that time too? No? Didn't think so.", "I'm sorry to disappoint \ud83d\ude1e It really caught me off guard and I asked what he was even talking about. I was only 17, I hadn't even graduated high-school and I was not getting married soon. I'm still not married. He just made up some weird hypothetical situation to make himself feel better I guess."]}
