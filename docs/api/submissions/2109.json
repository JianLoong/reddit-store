{"id": 2109, "submission_id": "yt4euo", "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter her father's last name?", "selftext": "I'm going to keep the background information to the facts as much as possible:\n\nI (33f) have a daughter (4f) with my ex-partner (33m). The pregnancy was unplanned and happened despite using contraception. We spoke about what we wanted to do, and he was clear he didn't want to be involved. While I'd never really considered having children, actually being pregnant changed my mind and I decided I'd like to keep my baby.\n\nWe parted on *not horrendous terms.* I obviously wasn't happy about becoming a single parent, but I respected his decision. My ex-partner was not involved in the pregnancy or the birth, or the first six months of our daughter's life.\n\nHe then had a car accident which I won't go into, but it changed his view on things. He sought me out and asked if he could be involved in his daughter's life. It was very difficult at first. I had just struggled through pregnancy, birth, and taking care of a newborn alone, so I wasn't thrilled he'd just waltzed back in. But I wanted my daughter to know her father, so agreed to let him see her.\n\nHe was genuinely remorseful and has, from that point onwards, been a fantastic father. He contributes financially and emotionally and shares half of all the parenting duties (dropping her off at school, picking her up, looking after her when she's poorly etc). We now have a good custody agreement (a legal agreement, we didn't go to court but we did speak to solicitors to have an agreement written up), with our daughter spending about 60% of her time with me versus about 40% with him. Things between us are good (we aren't together romantically, but we're on very good terms), and our daughter is happy, which is the key thing for both of us.\n\nRecently he's asked me if I'd consider changing our daughter's last name to his (right now, she has my last name).\n\nI said no. I tried to be nice about it, but I'm the one who grew and gave birth to her with no support from him. He was not involved in that part of her life at all, and I don't feel comfortable changing her name to his for a few reasons.\n\nFor one thing, she's very young, and I think it would be confusing to her at this point to change her name, especially as she's just started school, and secondly, it could cause issues for me if I don't share my daughter's last name.\n\nI said I'd be happy to consider double-barrelling our names, as he has proved himself to be a fantastic father, but that I wasn't changing it to solely his name. I also told him we could give her the choice of choosing his name if she'd like to when she's older. (We're British, so the custom is for children to take their father's name).\n\nI spoke to my parents about this expecting them to be on my side, but they both made it clear they think I should change her name and that I'm being unreasonable because it's normal for children to have their father's name.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668252343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt4euo/aita_for_not_giving_my_daughter_her_fathers_last/", "score": 691, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Double-barrelled is a perfectly reasonable compromise. And your parents are ridiculous.

It's also great of you to offer to use both names which is a good compromise but in no way did you have to offer that. He shot the idea down, so that would be the end of the conversation for me if I were in your shoes. If your daughter decides she wants his name when she's older then that should be solely her decision.", "NTA. A good compromise would be to just give her both last names. Is that acceptable in your culture?", "NTA for both of your reasons.", "NTA, at all. \n\nIt is great he stepped up. It is great that you two are coparenting so well. You happily agreed to give your child both names. \n\nYou should not be expected to just *drop* your own last name from their name tho. That is completely unfair, and kind of a slap in the face to all of the solo work you put in to parenting before he had his change of heart. \n\nSidenote tho: aside from this current issue, it's GREAT to see parents working together to coparent like this. I've seen the opposite too many times, your child is very lucky & by the sounds of it, very loved.", "NTA. Nope, don\u2019t change it. Let her make that decision for herself when she\u2019s an adult.", "NTA. Look, it'd be different if while you were pregnant, even if he didn't want to be a father, he put himself on the birth certificate and acknowledged that he was a parent. He didn't. He yeeted himself off to go live a happy child-free existence without you, even though he knew he was a bio father. Ask yourself this; if he hadn't had his accident, do you think he'd be there now? Probably not. He had a life/death situation that made him reevaluate what was important and he fortunately figured out he should try to do right by his child. Great for him. But he wasn't there when you were pregnant and vulnerable, or giving birth and vulnerable, or the first six months when you were likely running on zombie and panic mode. If he'd wanted her to have his last name, he should have stepped up when naming her was happening, not after the fact. \n\nWe call this a consequence of actions. Not being married has nothing to do with this. If you'd been married and opted to give her your maiden name if you also opted to revert to it after a divorce and he came back in later and demanded it changed, I'd say the same thing. And the fact that he's being a grumpy sulker about it proves my point. He wants some kind of controlling claim on her. He wants to be the one in control, just like he was when he left. He hasn't earned that. And frankly, at this point, it's her decision to make. If she gets older, maybe she'll ask you to change it. Maybe she'll be old enough to change it herself. Maybe she won't. But he's getting hung up over the wrong thing. \n\n\"You're upset she doesn't have your name. That's because it's a constant reminder that you bailed when we both needed you most. Maybe you need to talk to someone about it because this all sounds like a you problem and not an us or me problem.\"", "NTA. You did all the work before and around the time of naming. You also gave a very good reason (it can cause issues have different last names) as to why you don\u2019t want to change it. You shouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy partner and I are together (happily I think) and I insisted on double-barrelling so that both names were there as opposed to one or the other. Had I done it alone like you did, I\u2019d have done exactly the same as you and wouldn\u2019t change.", "NTA and don't back down just because people are telling you it's \"normal\".\n\nYou grew her, you birthed her, you *named* her,  alone. You still have her more than 50% of the time. It is likely to cause annoyances for you if you don't share a last name. \n\nPlus there's little to stop him bailing again. My friend has the last name of a father who did a vanishing act when she was 10. She resents it and would change it if it wouldn't be a whole load of effort professionally/practically.\n\nDouble barrelling is more than reasonable.", "Don\u2019t do it. \nMe end my ex split when my little one was 6 months old he\u2019s now 5 and I really really regret my son not having my last name or at least having my last name too, I\u2019m not going to change it because now he\u2019s an actual person and not just an idea and I think it should be his choice but I do regret it.  \nI\u2019m British too btw \nNTA", "NTA don't do it", "INFO: How did the father react when you said you didn\u2019t want to change her name?", "NTA and if he keeps pushing then consider going back to the solicitor\u2019s and making him legally GTFBO", "NTA", "NTA.

Those values arent the 'norm' now.\n\nHopefully her father can understand the compromise and accept it. The important thing is to BE the father, which it sounds like he is doing.", "NTA. I wouldn't change your daughters name to his even if he has been a great father lately.", "NTA.

After all, it's not YOUR name, it is HERS.  So this isn't a decision that should me made by father (alone), mother (alone) or even parents (without input from daughter).  Considering her age, I think the best thing is you have one vote, father has one vote and daughter also has one full vote.   2 out of 3 decides the issue.  Oh, and it would only be \"confusing\" for her if you did it without discussing it with her and asking her opinion, first.  But to be fair, both you and the father should discuss it with her.  (You both have a chance to explain to her your feeling on the issue)\n\nOh, and it's not going to cause \"issues\" for you if her name is changed.  Approach any 100 random women in a shopping mall who have children.  Ask them their names.  If you can find one family where the woman gave birth to more than one child and all the human beings have the same last name?

The consequences of his choices are also his to own - (1) that there was no reason to give child his last name when she was born and (2) child still doesn't have his last name.\n2. Your parents must just be operating on old school norms. There are plenty of children who do not have a father's last name as their own, and there are plenty of different situations/reasons why. (You could point to kids who don't know who their fathers are as an example. Parents could say well that's not the case for your child. Then you can say the dads whose kids are named after them were present and involved when those kids were born, and that is NOT THE CASE for your child.)\n3. You are not denying ex the chance for child to have his last name. (He is. It's has ALWAYS been ex's choice that resulted in the child not carrying his name.) Nor are you being vindictive. You have legitimate reasons for keeping your name as (at least part of) your child's last name.\n4. Even without the backstory (if you had been a happily married, mutually supportive couple at child's birth); it would have been perfectly reasonable and not unusual for you, as one of her parents, to want her to carry your last name, too.\n5. It's important to note that ex didn't care one whit about this child until he had a near death experience. His obsession with her having his last name seems to be a continuation of his reaction to almost dying. He sees her as HJIS legacy, and he wants desperately for her to carry his name into the future. You are offering him a way to do that' but that's not good enough for him. He wants to OBLITERATE YOU from the thing he wants so desperately for himself. He doesn't want your child to carry YOUR name into the future at all. (Screw that!!!) He may be a good dad, but he is incredibly self-centered and selfish.\n6.

Why Would you change her last name? Just because it\u2019s typical or traditional? Not a good enough reason.
