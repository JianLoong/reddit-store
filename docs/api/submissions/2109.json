{"id": 2109, "submission_id": "yt4euo", "title": "AITA for not giving my daughter her father's last name?", "selftext": "I'm going to keep the background information to the facts as much as possible:\n\nI (33f) have a daughter (4f) with my ex-partner (33m). The pregnancy was unplanned and happened despite using contraception. We spoke about what we wanted to do, and he was clear he didn't want to be involved. While I'd never really considered having children, actually being pregnant changed my mind and I decided I'd like to keep my baby.\n\nWe parted on *not horrendous terms.* I obviously wasn't happy about becoming a single parent, but I respected his decision. My ex-partner was not involved in the pregnancy or the birth, or the first six months of our daughter's life.\n\nHe then had a car accident which I won't go into, but it changed his view on things. He sought me out and asked if he could be involved in his daughter's life. It was very difficult at first. I had just struggled through pregnancy, birth, and taking care of a newborn alone, so I wasn't thrilled he'd just waltzed back in. But I wanted my daughter to know her father, so agreed to let him see her.\n\nHe was genuinely remorseful and has, from that point onwards, been a fantastic father. He contributes financially and emotionally and shares half of all the parenting duties (dropping her off at school, picking her up, looking after her when she's poorly etc). We now have a good custody agreement (a legal agreement, we didn't go to court but we did speak to solicitors to have an agreement written up), with our daughter spending about 60% of her time with me versus about 40% with him. Things between us are good (we aren't together romantically, but we're on very good terms), and our daughter is happy, which is the key thing for both of us.\n\nRecently he's asked me if I'd consider changing our daughter's last name to his (right now, she has my last name).\n\nI said no. I tried to be nice about it, but I'm the one who grew and gave birth to her with no support from him. He was not involved in that part of her life at all, and I don't feel comfortable changing her name to his for a few reasons.\n\nFor one thing, she's very young, and I think it would be confusing to her at this point to change her name, especially as she's just started school, and secondly, it could cause issues for me if I don't share my daughter's last name.\n\nI said I'd be happy to consider double-barrelling our names, as he has proved himself to be a fantastic father, but that I wasn't changing it to solely his name. I also told him we could give her the choice of choosing his name if she'd like to when she's older. (We're British, so the custom is for children to take their father's name).\n\nI spoke to my parents about this expecting them to be on my side, but they both made it clear they think I should change her name and that I'm being unreasonable because it's normal for children to have their father's name.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668252343, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yt4euo/aita_for_not_giving_my_daughter_her_fathers_last/", "score": 189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Double-barrelled is a perfectly reasonable compromise. And your parents are ridiculous.

It's also great of you to offer to use both names which is a good compromise but in no way did you have to offer that. He shot the idea down, so that would be the end of the conversation for me if I were in your shoes. If your daughter decides she wants his name when she's older then that should be solely her decision.", "NTA. A good compromise would be to just give her both last names. Is that acceptable in your culture?", "NTA for both of your reasons.", "NTA, at all. \n\nIt is great he stepped up. It is great that you two are coparenting so well. You happily agreed to give your child both names. \n\nYou should not be expected to just *drop* your own last name from their name tho. That is completely unfair, and kind of a slap in the face to all of the solo work you put in to parenting before he had his change of heart. \n\nSidenote tho: aside from this current issue, it's GREAT to see parents working together to coparent like this. I've seen the opposite too many times, your child is very lucky & by the sounds of it, very loved.", "NTA. Nope, don\u2019t change it. Let her make that decision for herself when she\u2019s an adult.", "NTA. Look, it'd be different if while you were pregnant, even if he didn't want to be a father, he put himself on the birth certificate and acknowledged that he was a parent. He didn't. He yeeted himself off to go live a happy child-free existence without you, even though he knew he was a bio father. Ask yourself this; if he hadn't had his accident, do you think he'd be there now? Probably not. He had a life/death situation that made him reevaluate what was important and he fortunately figured out he should try to do right by his child. Great for him. But he wasn't there when you were pregnant and vulnerable, or giving birth and vulnerable, or the first six months when you were likely running on zombie and panic mode. If he'd wanted her to have his last name, he should have stepped up when naming her was happening, not after the fact. \n\nWe call this a consequence of actions. Not being married has nothing to do with this. If you'd been married and opted to give her your maiden name if you also opted to revert to it after a divorce and he came back in later and demanded it changed, I'd say the same thing. And the fact that he's being a grumpy sulker about it proves my point. He wants some kind of controlling claim on her. He wants to be the one in control, just like he was when he left. He hasn't earned that. And frankly, at this point, it's her decision to make. If she gets older, maybe she'll ask you to change it. Maybe she'll be old enough to change it herself. Maybe she won't. But he's getting hung up over the wrong thing. \n\n\"You're upset she doesn't have your name. That's because it's a constant reminder that you bailed when we both needed you most. Maybe you need to talk to someone about it because this all sounds like a you problem and not an us or me problem.\"", "NTA. You did all the work before and around the time of naming. You also gave a very good reason (it can cause issues have different last names) as to why you don\u2019t want to change it. You shouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy partner and I are together (happily I think) and I insisted on double-barrelling so that both names were there as opposed to one or the other. Had I done it alone like you did, I\u2019d have done exactly the same as you and wouldn\u2019t change.", "NTA and don't back down just because people are telling you it's \"normal\".\n\nYou grew her, you birthed her, you *named* her,  alone. You still have her more than 50% of the time. It is likely to cause annoyances for you if you don't share a last name. \n\nPlus there's little to stop him bailing again. My friend has the last name of a father who did a vanishing act when she was 10. She resents it and would change it if it wouldn't be a whole load of effort professionally/practically.\n\nDouble barrelling is more than reasonable.", "Don\u2019t do it. \nMe end my ex split when my little one was 6 months old he\u2019s now 5 and I really really regret my son not having my last name or at least having my last name too, I\u2019m not going to change it because now he\u2019s an actual person and not just an idea and I think it should be his choice but I do regret it.  \nI\u2019m British too btw \nNTA", "NTA don't do it", "INFO: How did the father react when you said you didn\u2019t want to change her name?", "NTA and if he keeps pushing then consider going back to the solicitor\u2019s and making him legally GTFBO", "NTA", "NTA.

Those values arent the 'norm' now.\n\nHopefully her father can understand the compromise and accept it. The important thing is to BE the father, which it sounds like he is doing.", "NTA. I wouldn't change your daughters name to his even if he has been a great father lately.", "NTA.

After all, it's not YOUR name, it is HERS.  So this isn't a decision that should me made by father (alone), mother (alone) or even parents (without input from daughter).  Considering her age, I think the best thing is you have one vote, father has one vote and daughter also has one full vote.   2 out of 3 decides the issue.  Oh, and it would only be \"confusing\" for her if you did it without discussing it with her and asking her opinion, first.  But to be fair, both you and the father should discuss it with her.  (You both have a chance to explain to her your feeling on the issue)\n\nOh, and it's not going to cause \"issues\" for you if her name is changed.  Approach any 100 random women in a shopping mall who have children.  Ask them their names.  If you can find one family where the woman gave birth to more than one child and all the human beings have the same last name?

Why does he think asking this would be even appropriate after he left the two of you behind? Because he was in a car accident? Really! That's just outrageous.\n\nNTA", "NTA. People who don\u2019t accept this (your parents) and think otherwise can never give anyone reason except \u201ctradition\u201d. Honestly f them. Also YOU were there for her since day 1 without having any epiphany to change your views, so don\u2019t back down now.", "NTA- don\u2019t change her name. It\u2019s true you should keep it same as yours and give her a choice later. Your parents are wrong to say that to you, he\u2019s wrong to ask, and your right that it would be confusing to daughter this early and also disrespectful to you and all you did. I think double barreling the last names would be a great compromise.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry but she\u2019s not a toy for him to play with. What if he changes his mind again?", "NTA. He is.  She isn't a puppy.  It is a huge request.  You were and are the primary parent.  Just because he figured out that he actually wanted a kid doesn't mean he gets to dictate her name.", "NTA\n\nFellow Brit here. My fianc\u00e9 has been with me every step of the way in our sons life and we still double-barrelled his surname.", "Ask him *why* she should have his last name and not yours. Can't think of a single reason, also British and that 'tradition' is usually for married couples who both have same surname anyway.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t think you should change the name at all. There\u2019s no benefit to your daughter. \n\nSome things you can\u2019t get back. He missed the birth and the first months of her life and those are experiences he can\u2019t recreate. This falls in the same category\u2014 he can\u2019t get a do-over. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s your job to inconvenience yourself and your child to help his ego. When your daughter is older she can decide to change it if it\u2019s important to her.", "NTA, the custom in the UK or anywhere is the baby takes the family's name. And it was initially just you who had to took all that burden. If you remarried, it would make more sense to change it to the person's last name instead of your ex-husband; that's how little sense it is for her to inherit his last name.", "NTA.  Naming children after their fathers is just a societal convention, not a natural law that cannot be repealed (eg like gravity).  You can choose whatever surname you want as your daughter is part of your family too.", "It's great that he's stepping up now, but he's also learning a important lesson - if you miss key milestones as a parent you don't get a do-over. He wasn't her parent when she was named. To re-name her now would be all about him and not about her (or you!). You offered some great compromises. I'm sure he really regrets his early behaviour, but he can't wipe it out. \n\nNTA.", "NTA. Children who have their father's last name usually have their fathers involved from the get-go. That ship has unfortunately sailed for him.", "NTA \n\n\nI'm a teen dad. Had my oldest at 16(35m now). He has his mom's last name. I never tried to fight this as she was the primary perant but also I was a dumb teen myself and wasn't in his life fornthe first couple years(her perants had a hand in this also as they hated me). When she gave me the chance to be a dad again m, we talked about this very topic. We decided to wait til he was old enough to decide for himself. She has since married so now he is the only guy to carry there last name(rather rare name with a big family lineage)so be decided to keep the name. \n\n\nIn the end, guess what...\n\nHe is still my son, last names don't change that.", "NTA. You named her when she was born the way it made sense, because she was yours, and yours alone.  \n\nIt\u2019s terrific that he\u2019s now in her life, but why does he think four years later a change should be made? What is WRONG with her having your last name?  \n\nFor him not to consider and appreciate that your offer and compromise of a hyphenated version is very generous because it\u2019s unnecessary and insist on it being ONLY his name makes him the asshole.   He doesn\u2019t like that it\u2019s only your name, so his \u2018solution\u2019 is to turn it around on you and do something that you and your daughter both won\u2019t like and feel the same way about that he currently does.   Makes no sense, so he\u2019s a complete ass for asking and wanting to force it\n\nHe\u2019s literally saying \u2018I don\u2019t like it like this, so you and daughter should feel that way now yourself now for ever after instead\u2019", "NTA. We\u2019re you married to him? If not then his name wouldn\u2019t be on the birth certificate. Unless you added him later when he became involved in her life.

He probably just doesn\u2019t want her to know that he didn\u2019t want to be in her life.", "NTA, he checkout out and he comes back now, doesn't really deserve it. The compromise of double-barrelling the names is good enough.", "NTA. Pfft. He has not \u201cearned\u201d the right for your daughter to have his last name.  That life changing event does not erase this. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to be involved.\u201d Stand your ground OP!", "NTA at all", "NTA. Please let your daughtr decide for herself later on. My mom was a single mother and I was always glad that I had her surname and not my dead beats father's.", "NTA. So he was an absent parent and now that it suits him he wants to change her name? Rather see if he actually sticks around.", "NTA youd be making things harder on yourself and your daughter.\n\nWho deals with the schools? Doctors? Dentist?", "NTA. You did the work. But side note: my mom and I have different last names and it\u2019s never been a problem, not even once", "NTA.", "NTA.  \"Tradition for tradition's sake\" is a stupid reason to do things.  When you got pregnant, he wanted no part.  You went through the pregnancy on your own with no support from him.  You gave birth with no support from him.  You began raising a child with no support from him.\n\nNone of that is to belittle the fact that he had a genuine life-changing moment and is now a wonderful father, but also the fact that he had a genuine life-changing moment and is now a wonderful father should not erase the past and what you went through.\n\nI think offering to hyphenate the last name and giving the child the opportunity to decide for themselves when they're old enough is an appropriate compromise.  (Not even saying that compromise was needed, especially, but you definitely don't need to feel obligated to go any farther than that.)", "Nta. It\u2019s easier for you to share a last name with her and tradition is just peer pressure from dead people. Adding his name so she has both or waiting until she\u2019s older and letting her decide are both reasonable.", "NTA - have her keep your name.  Otherwise it can be awkward when you have your name and she has a different name", "NTA. Your daughter has a name. Where I live, unless the parents are married at the time of birth OR the father is there and signs the paperwork to have his name added, the baby will automatically receive its mother\u2019s surname. You offered an amenable solution. He refused.", "NTA.  Tradition is that the future or so-to-be parents agree on name in advance of birth.  He passed on the tradition and rejected the opportunity to negotiate this point.  Time has moved on.  The child was born and named.  Too late for him.", "NTA\n\nShe will have your name or his name. The only reason to change it to his name is sexism. Keep the name.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nMy child doesn\u2019t have the same last name as I do.  It\u2019s annoying to deal with having different last names for making appointments etc.  In hindsight, I wish I had used my last name instead of the father\u2019s last name.", "NTA she is your daughter", "NTA. I may be wrong, but 4 might be just old enough for the name change to be confusing. I think I d wait a few years and then ask the child which name she'd like to have.", "NTA. You are the one who went through the pregnency and raising a new born for the first six months all alone. Its like you are the Mother and the father rolled into one. \n\nAbsolutely stand your grounds. She is your daughter. \n\nThe sperm donor just got a rude awakening about the fragility of life and decided he wants to be involved. Which you grasciously accepted. Thats it.", "NTA. I have my mothers last name as do all her kids. She's never been married and wasn't going to give us someone else's name. I think my father has always been a little salty about it but they weren't married and she had no interest in marrying him(for good reason).", "Why on earth is the child\u2019s last name being the fathers relevant?? In what way?? NTA. But man your parents aren\u2019t the people to go to for advice like this.", "NTA- I read the title and was like no and then had to finish your post to see if there was anything compelling to change my mind.  Even if your ex accident causes him to not have anymore offspring, he isn't entitled to anything.  This is your daughter and she came into this world where her father abandoned her so just no. \n\nIt is up to you on what you want to do but know you're NTA.  Your parents say it's normal that your kid gets the father's last name, well it's also normal that the father be there for their child's birth.  Or at least be there after the child's birth.  Name change is also a headache and don't get steamrolled by what is \"normal\".", "NTA. You didn't need a life-changing accident to be 100% dedicated to your daughter. He still cannot be relied upon. He could turn around and change his mind again. You still do more and have done more for your child. She keeps your name. If he wanted a day, he should have been there at the beginning. This is a consequence, not a punishment.", "NTA. Him being born with a penis does not entitle him to having his children be given his last name, especially when he was an absentee father for the pregnancy, birth and first 6 months. \n\nYou are being more than kind by offering to double barrel.

My busband and I both have a different last name than our son. We haven't had a single issue except one doctors appointment where they assumed he had my lastname. Once corrected they never assumed again.\nYTA. You just don't want your ex to feel like he's equally her parent because you are still holding a grudge. That's petty. And once your daughter is grown and decides to take his name anyway you will be devastated at losing one thing you had total control over. Some parents shouldn't be parents if all their desire is to co trol every aspect of that child life. Starts with the name and evolves to more serious matters later in life.", "Long story.
