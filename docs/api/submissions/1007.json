At this point I think it's a straight no. NTA.", "INFO: \n\nHave you discussed your hesitation with hosting again, vis-\u00e0-vis the last visit\u2019s events? Like a human adult? What was the response? \n\nDo you want to have a relationship with the daughter you admitted you basically abandoned? What about grandchildren? At some point, are you willing to accept that you\u2019re reaping what you sowed, and chose not to have more involvement in making sure your daughter grew up as a responsible adult, in exchange for a relationship with her and your grandkids? \n\nMaybe the price of that is sucking it up and hiring extra help. \n\nAnd/or going back to question 1 and having an adult conversation about your concerns with an adult\u2026.", "Nta.", "They had us in the 1st half not gonna lie", "If you have photos of the terrible state they left the place in when they left, share them. \"I don't want repeat business from people that trash the place. Doesn't matter if they're family or not.\" I suspect the flying monkeys they've sent will start singing a different tune.", "If only they had a father figure in their lives to help teach them right from wrong. He's nta in this instance but probably totally ta in most other instances.", "Are you on drugs?", "Do you know anything about humans, at all?   I'm kinda confused", "You think they sound like civilised people who'd agree to that? They are freeloaders who see OP as a free holiday where they can get drunk and destroy his property.", "He's out of line, but he's right.", "While I won't jump to comclusions as broadly as you, I do wonder how they became such entitled, thoughtless adults in the first place.", "I think it's shitty of him to essentially be an absent father but they all also had mothers who could have taught them basic manners.", "Lol so their friends also became horrible guests cuz Op was an absent father to them as well? \nAnd besides, you shouldn't use trauma to excuse becoming an entitled, bratty person.", "This is the crux of the matter. You've made your home in that country. You've presumably made an attempt to fit in. Your children are acting like the very worst of first world tourists. NTA. Your children don't deserve to use your property until they learn to respect the country you live in.", "If you dont mind me asking, why werent you around? Work, or just, mixed priorities?", "He's not in line, but he's not wrong.", "What conclusions did I jump to? Op mentions he was an absent father who spent little time with his kids and when he did, he spoiled them. Op, meet your own petard.", "\u201cIt\u2019s one banana tree, Michael. How long could it take to grow, 15 months?\u201d", "Actually a grass.  They are herbaceous.", "Ah, I hadn't seen that comment. Yes, unfortunately sounds right :(", "I\u2019ll preface by saying I am by no means an expert on bananas lol. Does this banana have several bunches branching off of one singular stalk? Or like a bunch of stalks growing from the same base?", "The \"tree\" is much like a short bush with fronds coming out every direction from a central point. Then the bushels are kinda random, id argue off separate fronds\n\nI appreciate your continuance of the banana conversation despite that you are not an expert lol", "If it looks like a bush with multiple fronds then what you have is a clump of banana plants. A single banana plant will only ever produce 1 huge bunch. That's its life cycle. While the mother plant is fruiting, it will also produce baby clones all around its base. Once the mother dies, you're left with a whole bunch of new plants that kinda look like fingers of an underground hand. That central point you mentioned is where mum used to be.", "I am also by no means an expert but I grew up with bananas so-\n\nThe \"tree\" that everyone pictures is like a stalk with, as you said, fronds/leaves coming off in multiple directions. Then the tree will have like little shoots growing around the stalk. These are the \"suckers\" that u/reallybiglizard was talking about. \n\nDid you mean bushels like bananas? The stalk should be one straight cylindrical stalk with no irregularities. If there is like twisting or lumps like multiple stalks fused together then yes, it could be more like 3 trees.", "This is super cool and I appreciate both the knowledge and your delivery of it, I almost wish I had more banana questions, do you have any other fun facts about bananas? I know bananas are actually a berry, slightly radioactive, and high in potassium, but that's about it", "Yes my plant terminology is likely very inaccurate. By bushel, I mean the 60 bananas that are growing at once clumped together\n\nI never get close to them, because, spiders, so I cannot give any details on the stalk, there's so many fronds I can't say I ever even noticed the stalk, I gotta go see if I have a picture or something"]}
