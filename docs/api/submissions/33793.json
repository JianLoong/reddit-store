The issue isn't really that the Aunt noticed OP's toys, it's that Auntie and Mom decided to go after OP about it. \n\nIf you're looking through someone's things, even if you think your rummaging is justified, the polite thing to do is to pretend you saw nothing. OP shouldn't have to choose a different location for her belongings, her grown ass relatives should have the maturity to not gossip about dildos.", "I absolutely expect that guests in my home do not go through shit that isn't theirs. \n\nNEVER have I gone through anyone's bathroom drawers! If you need something , you discreetly ask, don't fucking rummage and steal. What grubby little grotworld were you rasied in?", "Actually it\u2019s not odd at all to not have your own with you. Women actually get their periods unexpectedly or run out. Probably shouldn\u2019t mansplain to women something you don\u2019t have personal experience with in the future.", "Definitely.  Be as pushy about it as you fancy.\n\nThat way you can feel good about digging through HER personal stuff! \ud83d\ude33", "Yeah, she was snooping", "Just thinking that she may have been looking for a pad and not a tampon.\n\nWhy so angry?", "I think someone needs a tampon", "And put a lock on that bedroom door that mom can\u2019t override. Sounds like IP\u2019s mom has some shame regarding natural sexual desires.", "I mean, it was just a comment. Like, I\u2019d rather someone not be able to find my vibrator so I don\u2019t think the bathroom drawer is the place I would store it. \nNothing I said supported the aunt snooping or being offended. It was literally just a suggestion for the future.", "One where you welcome guests into your home and say \u201cmake yourself at home\u201d and mean it.", "I do have experience with it. My wife, who does prepare. my mother, my MIL, my Step mother, my sister, my grandmother, etc. all who routinely carry around a few tampons or pads in the purses or bags of sorts to have them accessible. When basically all the women in my life are KNOWN to prepare, you would think it would be common practice. \n\nAnd on top of that, I didn't state it as fact, I said \"as far as I know\" because guess what, as far as I know, it is common. So how about you stop mansplaining mansplaining.", "If it helps, I'll womansplain it to even things out.  A 59 year old woman has enough experience getting her period to know to carry some emergency tampons. Periods can be irregular, we *know* that, and we do what we can to avoid being caught out. Do you really not carry a spare pad or tampon in your purse in case your period shows up early? You really ought to, it could save you from having to dig through someone else's stuff.", "she can use her big, grown 59 year old words and ASK or if not, keep her mouth shut about what she found UNDER a makeup bag in the bottom drawer of her nieces bathroom.", "You ask the person who is hosting you then. You don\u2019t just go looking thru their stuff.", "bc it's gross to go digging through people's shit instead of either asking them or bringing your own toiletries", "Think you might need a few to keep your mouth shut.", "Kindly take your misogynistic bullshit and shove it.", "Oh, must be a cultural difference -  Around here \"make yourself at home\" doesn't mean you should feel free to go through private spaces like bathroom drawers, it means be comfortable, help yourself to a beer, scritch the dogs belly etc", "The number of pads and tampons I have handed out to friends and strangers definitely says otherwise.", "At 59, does any reasonable woman actually believe she could still be getting a period??", "Yep, and yet we\u2019ve all been caught without them before.", "I get that. By why be angry at me for saying that menopause can take years. It was just simple comment.", "not sure why you're so riled up.  I simply stated that Menopause can take years, and you called me a pedantic asshole.  I never said anything about the woman having a right to snoop. So, maybe you are the one that needs to learn to read and stop being so angry.", "At 59, she knows better than to just rummage when she should use her words.", "I don't know any 59 year olds who still get their period, but I couldn't say with certainty that it isn't possible. \n\nI only commented because the other commenter made a good point, but you apparently needed to hear it from a woman in order for it to count.", "You responded with a plainly misogynistic trope. I tend to dislike sexist bigots.\n\nYour original point that menopause can take years was irrelevant (as OP had already stated period products were in the open) and did nothing other than potentially question OP's assessment that the aunt was snooping.", "Just making a point. I agree with you as well. I always asked.", "[deleted]", "Sorry, I was just adding to your comment.", "I have no idea what gender you are. But you ignore their point under the claim that they were mansplaining. Figured I could help \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f"]}
