I refused and said that my grandma gave it to me and she had no right over but she started crying and said that a fagot and wierdo like me doesn't deserve something so good looking. I was taken aback by this. That's when my grandma from my dad's side came forward and told me to give her the ring as I had already received alot of things from my grandpa and grandma she said I had inherited alot of good things and if I gave this one ring to my cousin it won't a difference in my wealth but this is about wealth my grandma always told that she loved the ring more then anything because when my grandpa had started a good sum of money he saved up and bought her this ring and she said that even if I don't like rings if I just kept the ring with me she will be very happy but some of my family have calling me mean names saying that I have no use of the ring.

When the guilt tripping doesn't work it is very common to move onto nasty name calling. It happened with my family towards the youngest female cousin by her uncle, who tried guilt trips like this, saying her mum was his favourite sister and he deserved her share of the house more than she did. She owed it him him, blah, blah, blah. Fortunately he already had a very bad reputation for getting money out of family so she didn't fall for all the guilt tripping, but he did switch from guilt tripping to more strong arm nastiness and trying to send flying monkeys to berate her.
