{"id": 27777, "submission_id": "16u1zej", "title": "AITA for telling my friend she and her bf can no longer stay at my apartment while I\u2019m gone?", "selftext": "I (25F) live in NYC with my bf (27M). A friend from home asked me a few months ago if she and her bf who I\u2019ve never met could stay with me SPECIFICALLY 5 or 6 days sometime at the end of September/early October. They would be in the city for a total of 12 days, but they had somewhere else to stay for half their trip. \n\nShe was coming because she had a wedding to attend and probably assume that because I live here we could hang out a couple times, which is fine with me. \n\nMonths passed since that conversation. Two weeks ago, I asked what days her trip were and what days she needed to stay with me because I would need to go out of town while she was here. I didn\u2019t plan a random vacation for this time, it\u2019s something I can\u2019t avoid. My bf also won\u2019t be in town for his own reasons. \n\nWhen I told her this, she told me she no longer had another place to stay because the friend she was going to stay with lives with 3 other people and a dog who isn\u2019t potty trained. She added in how she REALLY can\u2019t afford to get an AirBnB because they\u2019re both broke.\n\nI felt backed into a corner. I have a people-pleasing tendency, so I said she could stay here while I was out and for the remainder of her trip, but to get an Airbnb for 2-3 days so I could prepare the apartment and myself for travel. \n\nThis is where I messed up. I know how I am, I\u2019ve never met her boyfriend, MY boyfriend has never met either of them, I knew I wasn\u2019t comfortable with them being here while I\u2019m out and for so long. It\u2019s a minuscule apartment, it\u2019s incredibly old, in crappy condition, and having two cats doesn\u2019t help because it means I\u2019m constantly cleaning to keep it in shape. \n\nStill, she was only giving me about a week and a half notice about her situation, which is another reason why I felt backed into a corner. My boyfriend let me know he wasn\u2019t comfortable. I messed up here as well by not asking him first. \n\nFor a week I\u2019ve been trying to contact her to work this out, but she straight up ignored me until Sunday. Now it\u2019s Wednesday night, she\u2019s arriving in the city tomorrow, and all she\u2019s told me is that she can\u2019t afford to stay anywhere. She has an Airbnb for 2 nights and that\u2019s it. \n\nI feel like it was unfair of her to ask me for so much and to not communicate with me properly. I would still be letting her stay here 4 days when I\u2019m back, but that doesn\u2019t seem to matter because I\u2019m not giving her fully what she wants. \n\nI believe that if you can\u2019t afford to travel for fun then you shouldn\u2019t. I struggle with money and I only travel when I absolutely must to see family or something. I feel like she backed me into a corner with her financial situation and the last minute timing, but now she doesn\u2019t even have the decency to talk and work something out with me. \n\nI\u2019d never ask one of my friends to house me and someone who is a stranger to them for such a long time, especially if they won\u2019t be home. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1695862933, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16u1zej/aita_for_telling_my_friend_she_and_her_bf_can_no/", "score": 207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You\u2019ve gotta learn to say no when you want, because doing something like this - having someone make plans that are contingent on your help and then backing out - really, really sucks.  It leaves people stuck and they get very understandably angry when your assistance is necessary to their plans and they fall apart (or get much more expensive) when you pull out.\n\nShe should\u2019ve given you dates as soon as she had them.  When her other place fell through (or she realized it was unsuitable), she should have immediately contacted you to see if she could stay longer or needed to alter her plans to find other accommodations to replace the first place.\n\nDid you let her know as soon as you knew about this unexpected, unavoidable travel of your own?  That\u2019s not clear.\n\nYou\u2019ve already noted the other ways your people-pleasing behavior caused trouble.", "ESH.\n\nYour friend can ask to stay with you, but shouldn\u2019t try to guilt you into it.\n\nYou should have checked with your boyfriend before offering your apartment, and you should have immediately contacted your friend when you found out you were going to need to travel during their stay.\n\nIn the end, you don\u2019t have to allow your friend to stay in your apartment. It\u2019s something you were doing for free as a favor. She planned a VERY long trip to NYC when she couldn\u2019t afford to stay and she didn\u2019t consider that almost nobody in NYC has room for guests.", "ESH learn to say no. You could have easily said give me time I need to speak with my partner. Her accomodations are not your problem. Now it's last minute of course she is gonna ignore now. You need either day change of plans and you can't house and hem which is why you have been trying to contact her. You can her your sorry for her circumstances but you can't. Or let them say St and deal with it.", "ESH, grow a backbone! You even had a perfect excuse. Also, I can tell from here that your friend is a mooch.  She wasn't responding because I bet she doesn't have an Air bnb and is just waiting to tell you until she shows up, so you'll be obligated to house her.  If it", "ESH. I know you felt pressured, but I don't think she did anything to pressure you at the time you agreed to let her stay, she just stated that she had no where to go. It's your right to change your mind, but saying they could stay with you and THEN change your mind about it makes you the AH. It's okay, we all have likely done something like this. Just be sure to say no next time. You don't need to solve other people's problems, and you'll still be a kind person. \n\nShe stinks because she's not backing off once you've said they can't stay for that whole time or being gracious about it.", "ESH\n\nChanging plans at the last minute with no real communication is a dick move on your friend's part. However, inviting people your BF has never met to stay with you for that long without even discussing it is definitely the bigger AH move. I would be livid if my SO did that.", "In a nutshell:  she asked, you said yes.  She asked for longer, you said yes but get an Airbnb for 2-3 nights, which she did.  In the interim, you realized how big of a mistake you made, tried to call cancel it, and now you are mad at her and want her to be the asshole.\n\nShe is an ah for not responding for the last week.  You are an asshole for everything else and for being too cowardly to say \u201cno\u201d the first two times.  And you are an asshole for blaming her for \u201cbacking you into corner.\u201d  And for not bothering to ask your boyfriend.  And for taking no responsibility in this situation whatever.", "NTA. If she\u2019s refusing to answer your calls, refuse to answer the door.", "NTA and honestly, this doesn't sound like a great friend. Sounds like she intentionally left it till last minute to 'inform you' because she knows how you are. Just tell her that your bf has initiated a veto momentum and that they're no longer allowed to stay because no one will be there and neither of you are comfortable with that. If she whines, just say \"That sounds like a you problem and one you should have really thought about before trying to make it a me problem.\"\n\nYour 'friend' sounds manipulative, tbh.", "ESH.  Grow a frigging backbone already.", "NTA. Learn to say no. It'll free you.", "This \"friend\" sounds shady as heck. blow up her phone with a straight up I can't host you there has been a problem with our place, we have to vacate too. Then if she doesn't answer her phone, hey you tried. She shows up at the door, don't answer. If it persists, send a message to the neighbors to call cops; with that make sure you know your neighbors contacts. If the building is only accessible through needing to be buzzed in, then don't answer the buzzer. \n\nNext, get to therapy and work on the people pleasing. You're an adult and it time to have a spine and balls. Many good therapists and therapy resources in NYC.", "NTA - I agree that people who cant afford to pay for their own stay probably shouldn't be traveling to begin with. I also don't think anyone should burden anyone else if they cant find another accommodation. \n\nI have a friend that is a people pleaser, and it's really hard for her to say no but it's really important to start practicing that. Boundaries and communication on how you truly feel will help you feel a lot better in the long run. I hope you guys work through it!", "Absolutely NTA.  Your concerns about the unknown BF are very reasonable, as is your reluctance to host people in your apartment in your absence.\n\nJust because your friend waaaaants what she wants doesn't mean she's entitled to it or that you're somehow obligated to give it to her.  Her communication was lousy and her demands are unreasonable.", "ESH but her more than you honestly. You need to stand up for yourself and tell her you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her staying while you\u2019re gone.", "nta. if u can't have them stay with u, u shouldn't feel obligated to accommodate them. the price they pay for traveling is spending money on a place to stay. it should not rest on u to figure all of this out.", "ESH\n\nShe was kind of an ass for assuming and pressuring you and not being organized and dodging your calls. \n\nBut girl. You did not communicate that there might be an issue and you need to clarify dates until two weeks out. You then tell her it's cool for her to stay, without clearing it with your partner. Per your comments, she is arriving TOMORROW and still thinks she is staying with you, and you're now planning to pull the rug out literally the day before she arrives. Depending on her travel arrangements (it's not exactly easy to change flights) you could leave her seriously fucked and stranded.", "YTA. First off, you knew she was coming for months but didn't set clear boundaries. You asked for her schedule just two weeks before her arrival, but you should've clarified this long ago. Plus, you agreed to let her stay while you're not even there\u2014without consulting your boyfriend, who also lives in that space. Then you went back on your word at the last minute, leaving her in a tough spot. Sure, she's not great with communication either, but you made commitments you weren't comfortable with and that's on you", "NTA/ESH. Well, you you know you shouldn't have let this go on so long so murkily. But, still, I think you've got to put your foot down and just tell her that neither you nor your roomate are comfortable with strangers staying there especially while you're gone.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed to 5-6 days. You didn't hear from her for MONTHS leading up to this trip. That's on her.\n\nYou then find out that you have to travel yourself (? or is this you choosing to not be in your house so there's space for her?) on the days she now tells you she wants to be at yours for, and instead of 5-6 days, she's looking to stay 10 days because the other arrangement fell through and she has no money. That's on her.\n\nSorry, if she has no money for accommodation, she has no money for this trip. This is her problem, not yours.\n\nYou were an ahole to your bf by making promises to someone else about using your shared accommodation, but I think the larger issue is the lack of communication from your friend and the fact that she's springing on you now that she wants to stay for twice as long as she initially asked you for. If I understand your post correctly, you and your bf would need to leave your own place to make space for your friend and her partner because the space is tiny? Especially with that kind of situation she should have been much, much more communicative.\n\nShe has refused to communicate with you in the past week or so when she's about to arrive at your doorstep. That's on her.\n\nI feel like you no longer want to help her out because of her lack of communication and her making her problem, your problem (by insisting she stay twice as long because her other plans fell through).\n\nI totally understand if you want to back out of this. But you might end up falling out with her over this.\n\nI'd message her something like: \"Hi, sorry but this isn't going to work for me. You asked me many months ago whether you and your partner could stay at mine for 5-6 days somewhere around the end of Sept/early Oct. I then didn't hear from you for months, despite me reaching out to you to confirm dates. Unfortunately your other plans have fallen through and you are now pressuring me to stay at mine for 10 days. You have also refused to communicate about this with me for the past few days despite your imminent arrival. This isn't working for me. I feel that you are unable to afford this trip and are now imposing on me to try to make this work for you. You also didn't consider the fact that I would have to make my own arrangements to clear out my place so there's space for you and your partner to stay, and you are now pressuring me to stay for a week and a half, something I never agreed to. I'm sorry but this isn't going to work out. You and your partner are no longer welcome to stay at my place. I'm sorry if that means you can't go on this trip, but if this trip was so important to you, then you should have been much more communicative with me and much more considerate to me regarding the arrangements I would have to make to be able to accommodate you. I hope you can find arrangements with family or other friends, but please do not come to my place.\"\n\nDon't bother letting her stay for those 4 days that you can make work. She seems ungrateful and a major pain in the behind. Sorry, but someone like that, I wouldn't trust around my personal belongings.", "ESH/NTA - you gotta learn to say how you feel or if you are afraid of hurting feelings, you could say you needed to think about it and talk to your BF. That would give you time to pull your thoughts together. BUT since she isn\u2019t responding to your calls, texts and whatever communication, she is now the AH. Please try every way to get to her, email or social media if you have to and tell her plans changed and your house is no longer available. If she still doesn\u2019t respond, just don\u2019t answer the door and consider that friendship over", "NTA but YTA for not saying no and not telling your boyfriend who lives in the same house about it. \n\nYeah you can help your friend in need but if it\u2019s forced then you shouldn\u2019t. And the no communication is weird too. And you don\u2019t even know her boyfriend. Don\u2019t do it . Say no and move on", "It wasn\u2019t unfair for her to ask. Your inability to say no is not her problem.", "NTA but you will be if you let them stay there when your bf is uncomfortable. Ignore her like she ignored you. This sounds like her problem. It's not your fault she can't manage her finances, if she could not fit housing into her trip she should have stayed home. I think she should have let you know the specific dates of the trip (like why did you have to ask her, it was her responsibility) but also you shouldn't have agreed without knowing the specific dates. Don't let her guilt you, you have every right to turn anyone you or anyone your partner might be uncomfortable with away from your home for whatever reason because it's your home. If she wanted something more secure should have booked a hotel or something.", "Esh. Video every room to note condition and if items are moved or removed.

This is just one of many things I know it\u2019ll help me deal with better.", "No no no, I\u2019ve been trying to let her know for a week now about the situation, but she hasn\u2019t been responding to me. The only thing she has said is \u201cI can\u2019t afford it.\u201d I did not wait until the day before she arrives to tell her. She has been ignoring me. I stated to her plainly, but she literally won\u2019t talk to me to work anything out. Now I\u2019m left feeling like she\u2019s going to just try and show up because she avoided doing anything about it. \n\nI also think it was on HER to communicate to me her travel plans. Our initial conversation happened months ago where she asked me if she could stay for a few days, but she didn\u2019t specify dates and didn\u2019t really talk to me at all again until I had to ask her what her exact plans were because of my travel circumstances. If that makes sense.", "I don\u2019t disagree. The only thing I will say is that I initially agreed to 5-6 days. This is HER trip, not mine, so I believe it\u2019s her responsibility to communicate to me dates and whatever other plans of hers would implicate me as soon as she knows. The first time we spoke she only gave me a rough estimate, but didn\u2019t know anything at all for sure. I don\u2019t think I should have had to be the one to reach out. Because like what was she planning, you know? To arrive and then ask me for 10 days?", "I agree that things would have been easier if OP had set clear boundaries, but failing to do, while not optimal, is not what caused this situation.  If you are asking someone for a favor this large, you do your goddamned best to minimize the imposition you're putting on someone.", "Do this! Copy this verbatim! NTA.", "I didn\u2019t include this in the post just because I was running out of characters, but for you and anyone else who needs clarity: \n\nMy boyfriend is going on a work related trip. He\u2019s a performer and this event would be a very big deal for him. I was originally going to go along when we first found out, but financially it wouldn\u2019t work because it\u2019s a very expensive trip. \n\nThank you as well for the suggested text. I believe I\u2019ll have to send her something like that very soon considering she\u2019ll be in town tomorrow and I hope and pray she doesn\u2019t still think she\u2019ll be staying at my house all that time because I just can\u2019t have it. \n\nMy sister just had a baby a month ago. My family has been going through a lot (my parents have been feuding with her non-stop) but THEY are going to be away at this time and my sister really desperately wants me to come meet the baby and spend time with them. She\u2019s going through a lot because of the family drama and I feel like I owe it to her. \n\nI work a lot, full-time plus weekend work, so this is the only time I could make work. And my boyfriend being out of town as well makes it even easier. \n\nWhen I visit home, my parents usually pay for my travel so this comes at no cost to me (because I mentioned not going to his event because of the money.)", "If you need to resort to those measures because you don't trust people, then simply don't invite them into your home.", "You might have misread. There\u2019s no dogs coming to my house!", "Uh\u2026I\u2019d say this one situation is not a representation of my entire attitude overall lol. I don\u2019t tend to be a pushover for people I don\u2019t know and the majority of my friends here are still not super close, so things like this don\u2019t come up. \n\nI think given our history and the fact that I\u2019ve reached out to her 4 separate times in the last week trying to resolve this situation with no real response from her other than \u201cI can\u2019t afford it\u201d, it\u2019s okay if I lose a friend.", "That period of time she was ignoring you, that was the point where you literally type out the words \"you can't stay here, arrangements are too late and too complicated and anyways my guy said no\", straight and clear", "It sounds like she's been deliberately keeping you in the dark then dropping the actual plans on you last minute so you feel you have no choice.\n\nWeasely behaviour if so.", "No, you\u2019re not obligated to let anyone stay in your home. Straight up tell her that it won\u2019t work.", "You have no obligation. She is an adult who stopped communicating with you. Kick her out.", "In reality, your friend shouldn't even be taking this trip. If she can't afford to be gone 12 days then she should stay her ass at home. She is imposing on you and I wouldn't let her stay there for 5 minutes.", "Well, you shouldn't have had to contact her that was her responsibility but you also shouldn't have prematurely agreed without knowing the specific dates.", "She was \"not upfront with you\" first.\n\nI agree with you -- plane fare and accommodation costs are part of a vacation's costs, and if you can't afford them, you can't afford the vacation and you need to either wait and save up sufficient money, or scale back on your vacation.\n\nShe's changed the parameters of this entirely and is asking for ***way too much***, and you're not obligated to give it to her.\n\nStop feeling guilty. Contact her RIGHT NOW and say \"I'm sorry, but this is not going to work for me, and you're going to have to make other arrangements for accommodation.\" Then ignore any attempts to get you to change your mind. Just keep saying, \"I'm sorry, but this won't work for me.\" \"I'm sorry, but it's just not possible.\"", "There is a huge amount of space between people pleasing and telling someone to F off. \n\n\"I'm sorry, it was already a stretch to have room for you for X days.

Because it would be very one-sided if not. \n\nBut yah, you friend totally ignoring you when you tried to reach out to correct the mistake, that's totally on her. If she had answered she wouldn't be in that situation. Seems like she knew what was going to happen and just figured if she ignored the calls she could play dumb or something. \n\nAll just conjecture here, I could be totally reaching. Lol \n\nBut yah, you're allowed to change your mind, especially when plans change or hell you don't feel like it. \n\nTrust your gut. \n\nI'm sure they'll figure something out. \n\nFeel bad if you want, it's allowed, you have a conscience. But learn from it.", "I think the key thing is that \u201cyou felt obligated.\u201d  You weren\u2019t.

You'll find that your stress levels go way down when you cut them out entirely.", "Absolutely! You got this! Sending you positive energy \u2728", "You told her to get an Airbnb for the last 2-3 nights and she did.  You reached out, she responded.  Now, you are getting angry over the whole the way the whole thing unfolded.  Maybe just accept the part you played in this and learn from it.", "Ok, so it sounds like you and bf will both be gone for a few days and you would not want to host someone in your house without either you or our bf present. I think that's a fair concern, but looking only at that, I would say it's an ahole move to then change your mind about when you would be willing to host your friend and her bf. When did you plan to visit your sister? Was this after your friend told you her exact dates, or before? If you decided on this sister trip BEFORE your friend told you her dates, then you are not an ahole. If your friend told you her dates, and then after that you promised your sister you would come during some of those dates, then you would be the ahole.\n\nI think that within the context of your friend not keeping you in the loop at all regarding her dates, the fact that she has been so hard to communicate with overall and also these past few days despite her arrival being imminent, the fact she's now expecting to stay at yours for ten days (her other accommodation fell through, she only has a bnb for 2 nights, she said her trip is for 12 nights/days, so that leaves 10 days with you, no?!), you are in your right to say that this isn't working for you.\n\nIF you decide you don't want to host her at all right now, you need to tell her NOW. Although she has been terrible at communicating, I would 'be the better person' and be excellent at communicating YOUR situation/decision to her. You need to tell her right NOW whether she is welcome at all, or only for those 4 days (make sure you tell her exactly which dates and what time on the first of those she can arrive, and when you expect her gone on the last of those 4 days). Explicitly tell her that you can not host her for any longer/outside of those 4 days. If that's not good enough for her, just retract the offer altogether. If she is only happy with the full 10 days, tough luck but I wouldn't host her at all. You never agreed to this, and you can't accommodate this because you/your bf are going to be gone, and it's totally reasonable to not want guests in your house when you are absent for days.", "I'm sorry, I must have.", "Yeah I'm a bit confused on the ignoring part. If OP tried to call and didn't get a response, why wouldn't she text and say \"there's a problem with you staying here - call me when you have a chance\".\n\nOf course if OP _did_ text indicating the friend wasn't going to be able to stay and the friend never responded then OP is NTA.", "Friend took way too long to circle back on the stay and confirm dates.  All bets are off", "He definitely does. He knew they\u2019d be coming to stay after I first spoke to her. What I didn\u2019t ask was about them staying here while we were out. I tried to make it so that we wouldn\u2019t both be out of the house at the same time, but it worked out that way unfortunately and made things harder. \n\nI\u2019ll definitely take this into consideration moving forward. My sister advised me not to give any definitive answers to requests like these until I\u2019ve stepped away and thought about things first. I tend to jump the gun so this might be helpful.", "I\u2019m not angry. I\u2019m just stressed because she\u2019s not talking to me about anything anymore. I\u2019ve already accepted my role in this as I\u2019ve admitted where I\u2019ve gone wrong several times.", "So she told me originally she would be here very late September/early October for 12 days. And so when we were confronted with our own travel situation, I did NOT solidify my exact dates before talking to her. My bf did but that\u2019s because he really doesn\u2019t have any other choice. \n\nI figured that because she had a secondary place to stay, me being gone half of her trip wouldn\u2019t really be a big deal. But it was the whole \u201cI have nowhere else to stay now\u201d that threw a wrench into the whole thing because it felt like I was now obligated to extend to her much more than I signed up for. \n\nI\u2019ll be texting her one more time now despite her not responding to me and just state plainly AGAIN what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m willing to discuss it with her and work something out, but not if she keeps ignoring me.", "But the problem is that you\u2019ve admitted where you went wrong but you\u2019re still blaming her ultimately.", "I\u2019m only saying her lack of communication has made it more difficult to resolve. I\u2019m not placing full blame on her or myself.", "NTA Sorry but you have to tell her can't stay at all. Tell her your bf is not comfortable with the situation. For one thing, you have 2 cats to worry about. You are right if she can't afford this, she should have said no to the wedding. You live in the city, everything is very expensive, suggest she go across the bridge into NJ and look for a hotel, it will be cheaper.", "ESH\n\nYes your communication skills need to grow a spine and learn to not make things difficult for yourself.\n\nBut I want to get this clear - there was been no communication from her to you (ie she ignored your messages for a week) and then on Sun sent you a text to say she's coming on Thurs but only has 2 nights at an air bnb...  \n\nMakes you want to not be there when she turns up.. but that's really not nice.\n\nWhen she finally sent you a text on Sun that's the latest you should've sent back one to say you've been trying to contact her for a week and unfortunately she can no longer stay.  But really that text should've been sent earlier.\n\nSeems like the only option you have is to make the house quite uncomfortable for their stay.... which it will be... so they may suddenly find somewhere else to stay.  You want to be hospitable but not too hospitable.... \n\nOr find yourself needing to go to your sisters tonight so you won't be there and neither will your boyfriend.... so you'd need to send that text now.", "ESH but you have admitted where you went wrong, and what you need to do in the future to avoid this type of situation. Honestly OP - I think it's time to let this friendship go...per your statements about past situations, not being able to discuss how she's made you feel, lack of communication from her on her plans, refusing to respond to your texts/calls, she doesn't seem like much of a friend at all. Cut your losses and resolve to never put yourself in this situation in the future - lots and lots of good advice has been offered.", "Nta.", "ESH. But you more than her. You messed up. But the last two paragraphs are nothing but an attempt to shift the blame from your mistake. The issue here is poor communication from her end and making bad call from your end. Don\u2019t promise something if you cannot keep it. And if you cannot keep it, you should immediately let her know that. Unless she can read your mind, there was no reason to ignore you. Probably she was busy. You tell her your conditions and she did that. She didn\u2019t know you changed your mind. You should have texted her asap notifying her she cannot stay at your place instead of wasting 1 week.", "Nta, she probably planned to drop this bomb on you so she can have more private time with her bf. She knows you have no back bone and used that against you. Plus her ghosting you when you tried to work it out with her, yeah that's suspicious and she is so using you! Drop her like a fly", "ESH\n\nWhy didnt you text her immediately saying unfortunately its a joint home and as your bf is away too those nights you can no longer host them.\n\nBig deal she didn't pick up - that's her problem not yours, you should have texted her saying she isn't pick up and that unfortunately you've discussed it and since you are both away on those dates you cant host them for x days and that she should call you back immediately.\n\nShe's not really a friend in the way she is acting, she didn't give you the dates, she is bringing a stranger into a home that is not just yours, a wedding is just one day - she doesnt need to be in NY more than 2-3 days and if they cant afford it they don't go. The worst is her ignoring your calls but you are equally as bad for not texting her, agreeing about something when its not 100% your home, not being upfront in that call and saying we can't host you if we are both away - those days you will need to find somewhere else. And stop being guilt tripped - she isn't coming for an operation - she's coming for a vacation and a wedding that only takes up one day.", "YTA of course, you are a \"peoplepleaser\" but you could have avoided the situation if you just had said, it sounds good but I have to consult my boyfriend first. That is all. You promised something and you backed out.  Thia is your mess completely", "NTA. Your friend purposely didn't answer in case you were calling to say no. She is being manipulative and waited until the last moment.", "NTA but she is taking advantage and you may have to burn this friendship to get out of this", "Soft YTA because your friend asked, you said yes. Your friend asked for more time with you and you said yes. You didn\u2019t check in with the appropriate person who also lives there until very late in this process. You also \u201chave been trying\u201d to resolve it by hinting unclearly that you are backing out. You are not a total AH, but generally your behavior\u2026 it is. Be honest with people next time instead of saying the thing that you think makes you look good, you clearly struggle with this and it makes me question your story details about the friend.", "YTA", "Agree with this. ESH. You need to learn to not say yes to people when it\u2019s a situation that you need another person to sign off on. Your BF who actually lives there isn\u2019t happy and you should have asked him first. Practise assertiveness and stuff in the mirror \u201cthat sounds nice friend but I need to check with BF, will get back for you\u201d, \u201csorry but that won\u2019t work for us, we can only host on x day.\u201d \n\n\nYou are correct that if she can\u2019t afford a place to crash for a few days then she shouldn\u2019t be coming. I live across the pond but I know NYC is expensive. With tipping culture in the US, her meals alone will be costing her more money as will transport, activities, etc. She can\u2019t afford this trip. \n\n\nAlso she ghosted you because she didn\u2019t want to be told no. She sounds like she wanted to use you for a place to stay rather than come see you as part of the trip.\n\n\nTime for be straight with your friend and then do something about your people pleasing ways!

The automatic feeders and water come out when we travel just in case as well and we have a camera set up to watch them. \n\nI told her she would need to look after them and she agreed because it would be a small price to pay in comparison for a hotel.", "Maybe I didn\u2019t make this clear, but I did tell her immediately when we knew about the travel on our end and my boyfriend\u2019s discomfort. As I said, I\u2019ve been trying to talk to her for a week now, which isn\u2019t great, but it\u2019s definitely better than a day. She has known, if she\u2019s reading my text, since last Wednesday about what\u2019s going on, but has repeatedly failed to respond to me in a cooperate or timely manner. \n\nI also admitted blame for 2 separate parts of this and then just said how I feel. I\u2019m not trying to \u201cshift\u201d anything.", "The strange this is that I don\u2019t tend to people please so much with others, but the nature of my relationship with her has made me a pushover. I\u2019ve known her a long time and there\u2019s a lottttt of history there of times she\u2019s made me feel inadequate or like our friendship was conditional. I definitely need to get over that, but she\u2019s had a lot of shitty things happen to her in life that have made it difficult for me to ever express to her the ways she\u2019s made me feel.", "Maybe I made this unclear, but I did text her as soon as I knew about the travel and my boyfriends discomfort with the situation. I didn\u2019t sit on it. I told her a week ago, which isn\u2019t a GREAT amount of time, but definitely better than a day. \n\nI opened with asking if there was any way she could extend her stay elsewhere because things had come up for us, but she basically chose to tell me no, which from my side of things isn\u2019t really an option.", "For the record, I wasn\u2019t being unclear with her at any point. I definitely told her a week ago what was going on in a very clear way. \n\nThere\u2019s also nothing about this that makes me look good. I\u2019ve admitted where I screwed up plenty, but me acknowledging her faults as well doesn\u2019t take away from that.\n\nWe\u2019ve both clearly been at fault for different parts of this and lying on Reddit doesn\u2019t really serve me any good lol.

Can you extend your stay elsewhere is giving her an option. It should be its not possible for. you to say whilst we are both away - these are the dates I can help you with, you must find alternative arrangements immediately for the other days.\n\nIts not optional - you have to be clear and not allow someone a yes no choice.

Saying that doesn\u2019t automatically shift the blame for my decisions onto her, obviously.

The wedding is just one day like most. I didn\u2019t understand why the trip was going to be so long to begin with, but I figured it\u2019s none of my business to question their financial decisions. But as someone who struggles a lot financially as well, I have definitely not tried to make that anyone else\u2019s problem or rely on other people without a backup plan."]}
