Unfold your shit  if you really care.", "NTA. If he has a problem with how you do his laundry he can do it himself", "NTA you\u2019re not the mommy of a four year old.

As a man whose wife has done his laundry for forty-plus years, I can offer advice to your hubby. \n\nThere\u2019s a saying, Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.   Only say Thank You.  Untangle your own clothes and be prepared to wash them yourself, just in case your demanding attitude causes your maid to retire.", "Absolutely NTA! You're not his mum, I would stop doing his laundry, buy a cheap hamper, dump his stuff in there as he leaves it, all scrunched, and leave him to do it.

I'm all for petty where it makes sense, but this is an absolutely stupid passive-aggressive hill to die on.", "YTA. Don\u2019t wash his clothes if you\u2019re going to do this. Also it\u2019s likely more expensive to wash your clothes during the middle of a work day, so your double the asshole", "Sort of YTA? \n\nYou CHOOSE to do his laundry. So, entitled or not, he's expecting you to do it properly and not have gnarly wrinkled clothes. \n\nYou don't like doing it or dealing with his clothing knots? Then just stop. And it doesn't have to be a fight either. Personal laundry is PERSONAL. It's absolutely fair for each of you to manage your own laundry.", "YTA - you don't owe him the favor of doing his laundry, but if you're going to do it, it's an AH move to deliberately do it wrong because you're annoyed by doing it right. The solution there is *stop doing him the favor.* If he can't or won't take care of prepping his clothes for the laundry, then he'll have to do his own laundry. \n\nDoing it wrong on purpose is petty, and being petty is pretty much always the AH move. \n\nYou would not be the AH if you decided that the hassle of doing his laundry was too annoying to continue and told him to start doing his own laundry.", "If you're an asshole, then I'm an asshole. I routinely fold my husbands clothes in whatever orientation that come out of the drier in, because I simply do not see the big deal and don't care. It's a bigger hassle to turn an entire load of laundry right side out when you're folding than it is to turn a single shirt right side out before you put it on so he can deal.\n\nNTA", "YTA. Doing laundry isn't doing him a favour. It's your portion of the household chores. \n\nEveryone has annoying habits, the mature thing to do is just get over the perceived injustice of being minorly inconvenienced by your SO and expect and appreciate that he does the same.\n\nIf you start counting the minutes you spend doing things for him so you can throw it in his face your relationship is doomed.", "YTA. You can just skip washing his clothes, and then you would be N T A. But whoever takes on the washing, takes on doing it fully and correctly. Who ever cares how things are thrown in the humper, they all will be shuffled and mixed many times, as you dig through the pile to get specific things for the load. You take them out, shake them so they are all neat, put them in the washer. 2 seconds per shirt or whatever. No big deal.\n\nSo, do wash or don't wash, but if you wash his things, do it properly. You're wasting way more time, effort, power, and detergent by washing things in such a way they are still dirty afterwards. How long does it take to straighten a sock?", "ESH. Are you two really mature enough to be married?", "YTA...... Most assuredly.... the time to make things \"right side out\" is when you fold the laundry!", "ESH. He needs to grow up and listen. You've already asked him to put things in the hamper in an efficient/effective manner and he has disregarded you, preferring to reap the benefits of the mommy treatment rather than respecting you.  Choosing to launder the items in a manner you know will not get them properly laundered is a waste of water, detergent/etc, electricity/gas, time and your energy.  Either continue to act like a bonus mother and do the laundry correctly so as to respect the limited resources of the earth, or tell him you will not be washing items that are not properly prepped for washing. He can do his own laundry. And follow through with it. Be advised this option has the possibility of him throwing a temper tantrum over it but if that happens, he is showing you exactly who he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I *just* had a conversation with my four year old about this like two days ago.  He was very open to feedback, so I'm hoping it goes better for me than the OP.  He does this thing where he pulls off his pants and underwear at the same time so the underwear is stuck on his inside out pants.", "I was going to say that I\u2019ve started teaching my four year old how to turn things right-side out before putting in the laundry basket. Long sleeves and socks are still hit or miss but we\u2019ve only been working on it for a week or two! OP\u2019s boyfriend is ridiculous. And things aren\u2019t going to improve from the current status unless he gets a big wake up call. Even then I wouldn\u2019t count on it.", "I used to work hard to keep my husband\u2019s things organized and dusted. Then one day I realized I was giving myself more work and was worrying about things that weren\u2019t mine to organize or clean. I might tackle his shelves and drawers in our room maybe once a year, but if he wants them a certain way or cleaned, he can do it. He always thanked me for doing those things for him but it was so time consuming for me to do on top of the chores that did need to get done. If he is content with not organizing or putting things away right away, that\u2019s okay. Same with my kids. I have learned that it\u2019s okay for my kids to leave their block cities and Lego towns and train tracks on their floors. I used to fret about them cleaning each day but was just stressing myself out for no reason. If they want their spaces clean, they can do it themselves. Which is super cute when my youngest decides on his own to put everything away where it goes. Less things for me to worry about.", "This.

Do you want to spend that much time folding laundry?", "How is it more expensive to wash clothes in the middle of the work day?", "And she expects him to take off his clothes in a normal manner so that he does not cause her more work which is unnecessary. If he wants his laundry done properly, she is asking for it to be put in the hamper properly.", "i agree she\u2019s the AH, my bf does this too, but i prefer to fix it prior to washing and drying to make the folding process a little quicker.", "LOL, yeah I don't get it either.

I'm trying to remove small frustrations out of my life!", "Yeah this is something that you shouldn't have to deal with when doing someone a favor.

NTA", "my 8yo's laundry is like this \\*TEARS.", "I would say that I am similar to your boyfriend in how he undresses. When I get home there\u2019s nothing I want less than to put something hung up. I usually make a ball of whatever I took off and throw it in the hamper. It is absolutely counter intuitive, affects the dry cycle, and makes more time for me in the long run. But I just can\u2019t think about that after a long day. With that being said, I do as much laundry as my fianc\u00e9 who works from home. I also don\u2019t get in a fuss if she leaves my stuff for me. I know my weakness here, and I appreciate that she tolerates me despite it.", "I'd just start throwing his stuff in baskets without any folding at all, if he doesn't care why should you?", "At least ask him to fix his clothes after he undresses, that's what my mom told us when we were 5... so I think he should be able to do it too", "My girlfriend does the same thing, to the point where if I'm folding something that came out normal, I'm almost surprised.\n\nThing is... my girlfriend is also my wife and mother of my amazing baby, so I just shut up and turn everything the right way when I fold cuz it's a small thing in the grand scheme of things, especially when she's also a badass in everything else she does!", "FYI\u2026you can athletes foot from turning socks right side out!! I absolutely refuse to do anything but throw my husband\u2019s socks in the washer as is!!!!\nBesides if can\u2019t give you an inch to help you out then why should you go out of your way for him!! \nIt comes down to one thing really\u2026how important is this?

They tried to whine and say \u201cit\u2019s just a shirt\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s just some socks\u201d. I started folding the laundry myself and making piles of anything not right side out. I the. Called them over and said to get to it, it\u2019s just a shirt, it\u2019s just a few socks. They got frustrated because they saw it was several shorts and several socks and several pants. Their piles took a long time while my pile of right side out clothes was finished pretty quickly. Then I pointed out to them that was just one load of laundry and to imagine how many loads of laundry get done each week. They have gotten pretty good at doing that and know not to get mad at me if I don\u2019t fold the inside out stuff.", "Shirts with pictures on them should be turned inside out, to keep the picture longer.", "This is the laziest approach to laundry.   In my experience the person doing the laundry should be   making sure the clothes are untwisted, and either right side out or inside out (depending on whats being washed, like graphic Tshirts go inside out so the print doesnt get ruined) and also checking pockets for change, pens, lighters, phones, etc.  Determining what needs bleach and what doesn't.  Spraying any stain remover as needed.  Determining what goes in dryer vs hang to dry.\n\nSo in my opinion if you are doing the laundry you should be doing these steps.  Else, maybe you need to have a conversation around who should actually be doing the laundry.\n\nMy vote is ESH.  Him for not being an adult and handling his own chores, and you for the lazy passive aggressive approach to the chore.", "Tell that to someone who isn't doing 7 people's worth of laundry, many of whom go through several outfits a day. It takes hours. If you want to blame someone for being lazy, talk to the people who can't be bothered to undress themselves properly. Oh and I can tell someone else must do your laundry for you because of how clueless your comment is.", "Yep that was why I said I sometimes do it on purpose.

I don't machine dry those shirts either.", "I mean, screaming at someone else is also technically \u201ccommunicating\u201d if we\u2019re going to get exceedingly literal lol \n\nWhat she should\u2019ve said to him is \u201cI\u2019m not going to do your laundry if you can\u2019t get your clothes sufficiently ready for me to wash them,\u201d and then she should\u2019ve refused to do it at that point until they could have an adult conversation about the issue \n\nInstead, OP decided to just get passive-aggressive instead of just being assertive and actually setting a clear boundary with him. This is not how emotionally healthy adults behave in committed relationships", "The same could be said of most people, but typically in a relationship one partner does it for both. In my house for example, my husband does. If she has asked him to do something different and he won't, then instead of half assing the laundry she should just tell him to do it himself you are absolutely correct!", "why the fuck you doing laundry for two people 5 days a week?! i do all the laundry in my house, my clothes & my boyfriends, my sons, sheets, & towels. 4 separate loads. i do laundry twice a week.. minus wash & dry time, adding turn right side out time it\u2019s about an hour a week, maybe, to fold all of that & put away.", "I do all the laundry in my house.

That doesn\u2019t work for me. I take care of all that stuff before dirty items go in the hamper. That would be overwhelming for me.
