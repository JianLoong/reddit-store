I have asked him several times to please at least make his clothes are all inside out or all right side out before he puts them in the hamper.

Unfold your shit  if you really care.", "NTA. If he has a problem with how you do his laundry he can do it himself", "NTA you\u2019re not the mommy of a four year old.

Sounds like it isn\u2019t getting cleaned properly anyway. My husband used to complain I didn\u2019t fold his underwear so now I Don\u2019t wash his stuff and it is his problem if he doesn\u2019t have clean underwear.

As a man whose wife has done his laundry for forty-plus years, I can offer advice to your hubby. \n\nThere\u2019s a saying, Don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth.   Only say Thank You.  Untangle your own clothes and be prepared to wash them yourself, just in case your demanding attitude causes your maid to retire.", "Absolutely NTA! You're not his mum, I would stop doing his laundry, buy a cheap hamper, dump his stuff in there as he leaves it, all scrunched, and leave him to do it. He will not want to stink or look dirty so won't take long for him to realise!

I'm all for petty where it makes sense, but this is an absolutely stupid passive-aggressive hill to die on.", "YTA. Don\u2019t wash his clothes if you\u2019re going to do this. Also it\u2019s likely more expensive to wash your clothes during the middle of a work day, so your double the asshole", "Sort of YTA? \n\nYou CHOOSE to do his laundry. So, entitled or not, he's expecting you to do it properly and not have gnarly wrinkled clothes. \n\nYou don't like doing it or dealing with his clothing knots? Then just stop. And it doesn't have to be a fight either. Personal laundry is PERSONAL. It's absolutely fair for each of you to manage your own laundry.", "YTA - you don't owe him the favor of doing his laundry, but if you're going to do it, it's an AH move to deliberately do it wrong because you're annoyed by doing it right. The solution there is *stop doing him the favor.* If he can't or won't take care of prepping his clothes for the laundry, then he'll have to do his own laundry. \n\nDoing it wrong on purpose is petty, and being petty is pretty much always the AH move. \n\nYou would not be the AH if you decided that the hassle of doing his laundry was too annoying to continue and told him to start doing his own laundry.", "If you're an asshole, then I'm an asshole. I routinely fold my husbands clothes in whatever orientation that come out of the drier in, because I simply do not see the big deal and don't care. It's a bigger hassle to turn an entire load of laundry right side out when you're folding than it is to turn a single shirt right side out before you put it on so he can deal.\n\nNTA", "YTA. Doing laundry isn't doing him a favour. It's your portion of the household chores. \n\nEveryone has annoying habits, the mature thing to do is just get over the perceived injustice of being minorly inconvenienced by your SO and expect and appreciate that he does the same.\n\nIf you start counting the minutes you spend doing things for him so you can throw it in his face your relationship is doomed.", "YTA. You can just skip washing his clothes, and then you would be N T A. But whoever takes on the washing, takes on doing it fully and correctly. Who ever cares how things are thrown in the humper, they all will be shuffled and mixed many times, as you dig through the pile to get specific things for the load. You take them out, shake them so they are all neat, put them in the washer. 2 seconds per shirt or whatever. No big deal.\n\nSo, do wash or don't wash, but if you wash his things, do it properly. You're wasting way more time, effort, power, and detergent by washing things in such a way they are still dirty afterwards. How long does it take to straighten a sock?", "ESH. Are you two really mature enough to be married?", "YTA...... Most assuredly.... the time to make things \"right side out\" is when you fold the laundry!", "ESH. He needs to grow up and listen. You've already asked him to put things in the hamper in an efficient/effective manner and he has disregarded you, preferring to reap the benefits of the mommy treatment rather than respecting you.  Choosing to launder the items in a manner you know will not get them properly laundered is a waste of water, detergent/etc, electricity/gas, time and your energy.  Either continue to act like a bonus mother and do the laundry correctly so as to respect the limited resources of the earth, or tell him you will not be washing items that are not properly prepped for washing. He can do his own laundry. And follow through with it. Be advised this option has the possibility of him throwing a temper tantrum over it but if that happens, he is showing you exactly who he is.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's TA and you're not if he's throwing his clothes into machine / basket like that. But my clothes always turn themselves inside out no matter how I put them in the washer / dryer. It's like 75/25 % of the time for underwear and at least 50/50% for one or more sleeves / legs for other clothing.

One of my daughter does this, too. After asking so many times, I started doing what you do - give it back in the same state it went into the laundry. Now that she is doing her own laundry, she has not really improved. She actually - just this evening - ended up with a sandal in the washing machine, along with her clothes. She has put in a pair of jeans that still had a leather belt through the loops. When the belt disintegrated (not sure how many times before she had done this), I looked at her and said, \"*I guess you'll be buying a new belt for work. They last longer if you take them out before doing laundry.*\" \\[ETA: husband and I have each spent a lot of time teaching her/showing her/reminding her how to do laundry better than that. It's only a matter of whether she wants to take care of her stuff or not.\\]\n\nI know your bf is not your teenage child, but I'll share a few ideas that I picked up from some parent/child counseling we did:\n\n1. You should not be putting in more effort, more caring for their stuff, than they do. (That is easier said than done. And we are talking about almost adult teens, not little ones.)\n2. If they know that you are worrying/caring about their stuff, then they free not to worry about it. (Why should they when you are doing that for them?)\n\nI'll also share how impressed I was with a post from earlier this year. The bf was doing a crappy job of stuff and saying, \"It's fine.\" So the gf decided to go along with that. She let him do a crappy job of laundry, dish-washer loading... He visibly shuddered when dishes weren't cleaned well and she still served him food on those plates. She simply said, \"It's fine.\" When she put on a horribly laundered dress (he got bleach on it) to wear to his parents' house and said, \"It's fine;\" that's when the bf started putting some care into doing the chores.\n\nI think you tell your bf, \"*I'm washing your clothes as a kindness, but I'm not going to put more effort into straightening out your clothes than you do. If it matters to you, straighten them and make them right-side out. If you don't care enough to do that, then I certainly won't, either.*\"", "Cuz he\u2019s not inconvenienced by washing them because you do so he never has to think about taking them off properly.
