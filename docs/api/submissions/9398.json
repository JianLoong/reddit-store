He's being needlessly pedantic for no reason, he must surely understand there's no practical difference in you calling the cup noodle 'ramen' other than he wants to be the guy who is the most correct in the situation (and that guy stops getting invited to parties).", "NTA, cup noodles are instant ramen generally speaking. Besides, considering how many food items from all over the world are made wrong and still named with the original name i fail to understand your so's argument OP. I mean, there must be better things to focus on.", "NTA", "NTA he\u2019s picking a weird hill to die on.", "NTA for calling it different names but you may want to stop calling it just purely \u201cramen\u201d. Ramen has become significantly more common around the world now and a lot of people are going to assume you are referring to real ramen and not the instant kind. As a Canadian living in US, we just call it \u201cinstant noodles\u201d because that\u2019s what they are. Ramen is a Japanese word, ramyun is Korean and lamian is Chinese. All these countries make their own versions of instant noodles so we just lump them all together.\n\nETA: Pretty much all of my friends will assume you have some broth in the fridge and you are going to boil some dried ramen noodles to put into the broth when you say you\u2019re cooking ramen. Dried ramen noodles are different from instant ramen noodles too. Instant noodles are generally fried and already cooked. Dried noodles are not and require longer boiling time.", "It's like calling all tissues Kleenex or all bandages Band-Aids. Yes we know it's not the right name but it is the right thing", "NTA. Ramen is literally Chinese style wheat noodles in broth. Doesn't matter if it's the 50 cent just add hot water variety or the awesome ramen shop bowl with a soft boiled egg, broth that 's been simmering for 24 hours and hipster ambiance. Your boyfriend needs to understand the difference between fact and his opinion.", "Kleenex is what I thought of too, like is he that much of a snob that if you asked for a Kleenex he wouldn't give you one and would instead mock you because 'these are tissues, not Kleenex brand'?", "Yes, that's our reputation. In reality, Canadians are supremely passive aggressive. We just do a really great job at the passive part so I guess it reads as politeness? This to me looks like Canadian boyfriend is insecure about what he assumes is his girlfriend's superiority complex because she's from the US. It's unfortunately not uncommon.", "HAHAHA!! Hook and loops!!!", "Canadian here. We've always called it instant noodles or instant ramen. If my partner says he's making noodles, I know he means instant ramen. If one of us just refers to wanting ramen, we mean the full, restaurant-style ramen. BF is definitely just being pretentious.", "Maybe it comes from the brand name Elastoplast. Or maybe the brand name came from the actual name, idk but there's a connection", "I sell on Ebay, and they took down a listing I made for copyright infringement because I described the shoes closure as Velcro. I was absolutely floored. I had no idea what else to call that type of closure.  Also I think you are NTA and your boyfriend was completely in the wrong, both factually, and in how he acted.", "Um... Coca-Cola is based in Atlanta \u2013 it was founded there in 1886. Literally everyone in Georgia knows what Coke is.", "Also Canadian and I agree. If someone just says 'ramen', I'm going to assume Mr. Noodles or something like it. If they mean 'real' ramen, then people specify that it's the real deal. (And are usually pretty excited about it lol. Real ramen is a treat!)", "Those are like the best two kinds of ramen as well, kudos", "It\u2019s real ramen but not \u201creal ramen.\u201d Due to the ubiquity of packet ramen, disambiguating is required if it\u2019s not clear from context.\n\nLike if I said \u201cI\u2019m having real mac and cheese for dinner,\u201d would you think for one second that I meant KD? \u201cReal\u201d in this context refers to authenticity, not its state of existence.", "Agreed! Paldo's rabokki noodles are really damn good too.\n\nFor photo reference, this is a terrible price: https://www.amazon.com/Paldo-Korean-Ramen-Family-Rabokki/dp/B06XVL53VW", "Also samyang buldak", "Had the same experience in NC! I asked for iced tea, she asked me sweet or unsweet, I had no idea what she meant, so I said regular. I got sweet tea, and I was very unprepared for the experience. Liquid diabetes, and so delicious.", "I actually don't like those, I think I'm broken. I've tried a few few of the different varieties and don't find any of them to taste good, especially not good enough to make the spice worth it. But that definitely seems to be a me problem, judging by how popular they are!"]}
