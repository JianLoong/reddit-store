I had a great job in sales before covid, but we found during the pandemic that things just worked better with H at work and me at home (he earns enough to support us both).\n\nI never thought I'd end up being a \"traditional\" wife, but given that he's the breadwinner, I sometimes feel as though i should pick up a lot of the slack at home. I'm not a great cook, but I'm sociable and enjoy being the hostess. When H has friends over to watch soccer, I prep a huge tray of snacks, keep the beers on ice, and pop in with drink and food top ups during the game. I don't stay to watch, but I do ask the guys how they're doing etc, just polite chit chat. They all seemed into it and often comment that H has done well to have such a great wife. It's a nice set up.\n\nLast week, H came home with a beautifully gift wrapped box and said he'd got me a little something to wear when his friends are next over. I do my best to dress nicely when they're round, so I figured it would be a pretty dress or something. He had this huge grin on his face so I was SO excited. I opened the box to find a red latex mini dress and a ball gag. The gag was designed to look like a soccer ball and the dress is in his teams colour. I didn't know what to say at first, I was so confused (he's never been into anything like that, he's very vanilla). I asked if it was a joke and at first he said no and told me his friends wouldn't believe how lucky he was if I walked in with the snacks like that. I can't remember what I said next, but then he told me it would be hilarious if i wore it and I should lighten up. I gave it a nervous laugh and told him I thought it was funny too.\n\nThis morning, he'd put both items on my dresser and said he's looking forward to seeing me in them when the guys are round tomorrow. I reminded him that he said it was a joke, he got a bit sulky and said he can't believe I don't have a sense of humour. But from what he's saying, it sounds like he's expecting me to wear it? I'm so confused because 1) I don't know if he's done this as a joke because his friends think I talk too much, or 2) If he'd get off on me being humiliated.

Abusive men frequently pimp out their victims. Your husband wants you to wear BDSM attire FOR THE ENJOYMENT OF HIS FRIENDS. No. Hell no. \n\n  You need to put your foot down. If there\u2019s someone in your life that you can trust, I would tell them what\u2019s happening, and make a backup plan in case you need to get out quickly.
