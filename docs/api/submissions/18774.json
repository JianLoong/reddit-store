I'm not a great cook, but I'm sociable and enjoy being the hostess. When H has friends over to watch soccer, I prep a huge tray of snacks, keep the beers on ice, and pop in with drink and food top ups during the game. I don't stay to watch, but I do ask the guys how they're doing etc, just polite chit chat. They all seemed into it and often comment that H has done well to have such a great wife. It's a nice set up.\n\nLast week, H came home with a beautifully gift wrapped box and said he'd got me a little something to wear when his friends are next over. I do my best to dress nicely when they're round, so I figured it would be a pretty dress or something. He had this huge grin on his face so I was SO excited. I opened the box to find a red latex mini dress and a ball gag. The gag was designed to look like a soccer ball and the dress is in his teams colour. I didn't know what to say at first, I was so confused (he's never been into anything like that, he's very vanilla). I asked if it was a joke and at first he said no and told me his friends wouldn't believe how lucky he was if I walked in with the snacks like that. I can't remember what I said next, but then he told me it would be hilarious if i wore it and I should lighten up. I gave it a nervous laugh and told him I thought it was funny too.\n\nThis morning, he'd put both items on my dresser and said he's looking forward to seeing me in them when the guys are round tomorrow. I reminded him that he said it was a joke, he got a bit sulky and said he can't believe I don't have a sense of humour. But from what he's saying, it sounds like he's expecting me to wear it? I'm so confused because 1) I don't know if he's done this as a joke because his friends think I talk too much, or 2) If he'd get off on me being humiliated.

Others have said most/all of it already but I'm going to put it together for you.\n\nFirst, he is not vanilla. I'm not sure exactly what his kink is here (there are multiple choices), but he's been into it for a while and you're just now hearing about it. As others have pointed out, he probably also has a major porn habit. How do I know? Because (a) this is hardcore fetish stuff and not easy to find, and (b) he has a REALLY skewed opinion of what people will think about it. The fact that his eyes lit up before you opened the package is a big clue: in the world of stuff he watches, you \\*would\\* have been delighted.\n\nSecond, as much as you think it was your decision to stay home, it was probably his plan all along. There were probably plenty of subtle reminders, if you look back, that you didn't really need your income, that your job was a problem in some way, whatever. It's part of a classic abuser pattern to isolate you and take away your capacity to leave. He probably controls the money too, right? Even if you have access to all of it and audit it... this is probably really important to him. Why do I suspect he controls the money? Because you would have seen this coming if you did.\n\nThird, I know this seems so outrageous you have no idea how to react. That is the POINT. It's a technique for wearing down boundaries -- you do something so crazy your partner gets into freeze mode, and then they tend to underreact. He chose this path because he didn't think you'd go along with it if you just talked about it first like a normal couple. Unfortunately, this gets results sometimes, especially on short notice. And then, as a partner, it's hard to reestablish that boundary, especially if you start also dealing with psychological damage for doing something that crossed where you ultimately think it should have been drawn.\n\nWhat comes next is not pretty. Either you go along with it all and start hating yourself for it, or you try and split the difference and start hating your life, or try drawing boundaries and then he cheats on you to get his kinks satisfied and blames you for it. Actually, the latter will probably happen regardless, unless you share them. \n\nThese are very, very common patterns. I've been in a freaking support group of women who found themselves in similar situations. As tempting as it is, you can't communicate your way out of this -- he's already shown he doesn't respect you with calling you uptight and an AH and trying to guilt you into wearing it for his friends. You can only communicate your way out of problems with a partner who truly respects you.\n\nI guarantee there is far more going on here than you know right now. Get your vital documents and any valuables out of the house. Make sure you have some money you can access and he cannot. Get a lawyer and find out your options. I know leaving seems like overreacting right now, but it's NOT. I'm a little surprised he's pulling this before you have kids, but believe me, the scenery on this path just keeps getting crazier and more demeaning.", "Agreed!  \n\nAnd OP, NTA but please please go back to work.
