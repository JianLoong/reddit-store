We discussed her not paying rent until she was able to find a job and then we would split rent and utilities 75-25 as I make more than she does. She found a job in April 2022 making $20/hr but hasn\u2019t contributed ($350/month is her share) to rent/utilities since and always has an excuse (pink tax, spent too much on Christmas gifts, cost of living in my city is higher, she needs to rebuilt savings after not working 4 months) I pay for dates, vacations, rent, utilities, insurance, and bought her a car when she moved here. She chooses to only work 20-25 hrs a week, typically works 11-4 or 12-4. \n\nWhen she first moved in we split household chores basically 50/50 for daily items. However I noticed when ever it came to deep clean days once a quarter she would have cramps, a headache, pick a fight over something and leave the house before even starting or within the first hour. \n\nShe fractured her foot last December and I took over doing everything, shopping, cleaning, cooking, taking her to and from work. Her foot has healed and physio finished end of April but my job has gotten crazy and I work 60+ hrs a week and spend 3-4 nights a week in a different city on a project. I come home and the house keeps getting worse, fridge empty, dishes piled up in sink, plates, cups, garbage on her nightstand, by the tub, on the end table downstairs, and have to tidy, clean, shop. She has started cooking dinner again because when I am home I am at the office until 7-8pm trying to get caught up, but she needs me to plan out what she should cook. \n\nEverything boiled over this last Sat when I asked her to sweep and mop/wetjet the floor while I went to go to hardware store and Costco after she got out of bed finally at 2:30 in afternoon. I had been cleaning and tidying house all morning. I came home and she hadn\u2019t done it and was drinking & watching friends for the millionth time. (She watches 3+hrs a day of friends episodes). I admit I lost my cool and yelled that I supported her thru the last 6 months and I can\u2019t keep doing everything. She yelled at me I was sexist and old fashioned to tell her to do house chores and that I should hire a maid if I want it done. I told her that I\u2019m tired of her not helping out anymore so she can start paying rent like we agreed when she moved here or she can start doing the bigger share of household chores. I feel unsupported as a partner and am burning out between work and household responsibilities.

She is trying to be in a relationship where she has everything done for her. Get a new girlfriend because it won't end well.", "In the last 18 months she's moved in, she paid no rent, utilities, you pay for all bills, food, vacations and you bought her a car.  And now she wants you to get a maid.  \n\nIt's been 18 months.  She's shown you her true colors.  \n\nGet out now. \n\nBecause she's going to want a chef next.  And if you two have kids, a nanny for them too.\n\nEdited to add NTA", "NTA but this is a wider relationship issue that you guys need to sort out sooner rather than later. You seem to have completely different views about what being an adult and one half of a partnership is. Sorry.", "NTA - someone needs to put on her big girl pants.  She might need a little help with that, please put yourself first since no one else will.  \n\nI tend to give in to those that I love so I know how hard this can be.  This doesn't sound like a very good way to live.", "NTA\n\nShe's using you.... Whether she means to or not. You bought her a car and then allowed her to live in your home rent free for the last year and a half.... The fact that she isn't contributing anything financially is not cool at all. But to say \"hey, since you're not paying anything at all, you should step up in other ways.\" That isn't even remotely close to sexist. And she's just saying that cause she doesn't want to help more. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might want to re-think this relationship if she's not even willing to do more around the house if she's not going to pay.", "NTA\n\nYou should be a little more insistent on her paying the rent. Maybe her reasons are genuine too but she is an adult herself and should take the responsibility to either spend less or work more.", "NTA but you have two options..... Either leave her or accept the situation since she has shown you her true colours. She is living the life she wants enabled by you supporting her. A decent human being would have done all they can to get a full time job and shared the household chores with you, unfortunately you have been taken for a one sided ride here.", "NTA\n\nYou need to set firm boundaries. She needs to be contributing X amount by Y date or find a place of her own. Trading chores for rent will not make you feel equal. I personally would stop paying for dates and vacations until she picks up the slack or you come to a new agreement. She clearly can't afford to travel if you're paying for everything.\n\nThis all changes if this is a lifetime/longterm relationship and you want to accept caring for her financially as part of it.  But in a basic bf/gf scenario she's out of line.\n\nShe also sounds possibly depressed. Moving a long distance can be depressing in ways you never anticipated. It happened to me, to my BIL, to my mom... It's a big adjustment. I'd encourage her to see her doctor about this. But, in the meantime, she lives there too and needs to contribute financially and to the maintenance of the home.", "I mean she needs to GTFO if she's not going to contribute what she agreed to AND she's not going to participate in the household. What does she even bring to the relationship then? YTA if you let her stay.", "Nta. I'd get a new gf.", "NTA, but damn are you stupid if you keep allowing her to take advantage of your hard work. You need to set firm boundaries and expectations, and if she won't comply you need to remove her from your life. You are doing neither yourself or her any favors by allowing her to coast through life by taking advantage of you.", "NTA and when I was 20 I had a boyfriend just like that.  Took me about 18 months to figure out he was a bum and I was going to work myself to death supporting us.

Put her out let her make her own way or threaten to and see if she changes. It's sad when a relationship is one sided and this one is very much one sided", "NTA but also this sounds like depression potentially, I honestly highly suggest talking to a doctor and possibly a therapist. I can be just as bad or worse when I am going through a mental health episode so I relate to the description of her. You're not wrong, but she might need help. She also has to want to get help, if that is the case, and that part is 100% on her.", "You\u2019ve allowed her to ignore your agreement for this long, and so you\u2019ve shown her that she can get away with doing far less than she agreed to do. Now you\u2019ve changed the rules and are insisting, suddenly, that she honor the agreement you\u2019ve let her ignore for over a year. \n\nOn the one hand, insisting that she honor the agreement seems pretty reasonable. On the other hand, she might feel legitimately aggrieved that you\u2019re suddenly changing the rules and expectations. \n\nUsually, in the \u201cwhat\u2019s expected\u201d fight, the tie goes to the \u201cwhat is / isn\u2019t enforced\u201d rather than \u201cwhat\u2019s written down\u201d, morally. In effect, by not enforcing the agreement, you showed her with your actions that it wouldn\u2019t be enforced. In that sense, you\u2019re \u201cchanging the rules\u201d. \n\nSo, while any objective lens on fairness might be biased towards you, for agreeing to pay 75% and for having what most of us would hear as pretty low expectations, the fact that you\u2019ve set and enforced even lower expectations mean that you\u2019re at least partially on the hook for them. \n\nBecause you\u2019re just as responsible as your GF is for the status quo of her not meeting your stated but unenforced expectations, ESH.", "NTA.

When people show you who they are, listen.", "NTA.. you shouldn't have to do and pay for everything. That's not a partnership. Insist on the rent, don't wash her clothes, and perhaps look into counseling. You need to get some self esteem and stop putting up with her crap.", "NTA It\u2019s time to say goodbye to her.", "NTA. My partner pays the mortgage,  utilities,  groceries. We have a joint account where my money goes, and I pay for animal care (we have senior pets who require weekly treatments at the vet), my personal expenditures (which are like, gas to get to work and a haircut every 3 months). \n\n He does not need to lift a finger in this house as far as cleaning goes. I work 30-38 hours a week in a physically demanding job, but I would never think to have him scrubbing dishes or mopping floors when he pays for almost everything. In fact, he told me the other day that he was glad I was home because he spilled on the floor and didn't know how to turn my vacuum on (I've lived here 2 years) since he's never needed to use it before. He does the yard work and cooking because he likes to, we split shoveling (though I shovel most because he just drives through it). You are NTA at all to expect your partner to pitch in. Watching TV for 3 hours a day is fine, as long as your chores are done.", "I really can't believe the length of time some people put up with things like this", "This is so true. Also cool name.", "I think OP said he did ask her. He didn't mention how many times or if he was insistent or not.  I mean how many times do you have to remind a grown-up to do their share?  I am sure the person knows and just trying to evade it by giving vague excuses and when the work part comes, she just runs away.  Me and my wife have an agreement.  I make the most money so I contribute more but she will do one or 2 extra chores to compensate but in saying that she did it on her own I did not force her or asked. OPs SO seems like she wants her cake and eat it to.", "Sounds like she just wants to coast by on OP's hard work to me. I was depressed in the past when my life was shit as well this is not me taking that possibility lightly.\n\n Depression did not make me ungrateful to those close to me, I still loved them and put my best foot forward for them. I just didn't do anything for myself because I hated myself. I understand it's different for everyone, but I still don't think depression should be used as an excuse for that type of behavior, even if she is depressed.", "No, just no. He's an idiot for letting her take advantage of him for this long but he's not an AH. Allowing her to skate by is not the same as approving it, he is not morally responsible for her being a leech, he's just stuck with the damage she's done to his life before he removes her from it.", "lol!! OP is an ah because they supported their gf for over a year before getting upset about it...."]}
