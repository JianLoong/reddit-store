We discussed her not paying rent until she was able to find a job and then we would split rent and utilities 75-25 as I make more than she does. She found a job in April 2022 making $20/hr but hasn\u2019t contributed ($350/month is her share) to rent/utilities since and always has an excuse (pink tax, spent too much on Christmas gifts, cost of living in my city is higher, she needs to rebuilt savings after not working 4 months) I pay for dates, vacations, rent, utilities, insurance, and bought her a car when she moved here. She chooses to only work 20-25 hrs a week, typically works 11-4 or 12-4. \n\nWhen she first moved in we split household chores basically 50/50 for daily items. However I noticed when ever it came to deep clean days once a quarter she would have cramps, a headache, pick a fight over something and leave the house before even starting or within the first hour. \n\nShe fractured her foot last December and I took over doing everything, shopping, cleaning, cooking, taking her to and from work. Her foot has healed and physio finished end of April but my job has gotten crazy and I work 60+ hrs a week and spend 3-4 nights a week in a different city on a project. I come home and the house keeps getting worse, fridge empty, dishes piled up in sink, plates, cups, garbage on her nightstand, by the tub, on the end table downstairs, and have to tidy, clean, shop. She has started cooking dinner again because when I am home I am at the office until 7-8pm trying to get caught up, but she needs me to plan out what she should cook. \n\nEverything boiled over this last Sat when I asked her to sweep and mop/wetjet the floor while I went to go to hardware store and Costco after she got out of bed finally at 2:30 in afternoon. I had been cleaning and tidying house all morning. I came home and she hadn\u2019t done it and was drinking & watching friends for the millionth time. (She watches 3+hrs a day of friends episodes). I admit I lost my cool and yelled that I supported her thru the last 6 months and I can\u2019t keep doing everything. She yelled at me I was sexist and old fashioned to tell her to do house chores and that I should hire a maid if I want it done. I told her that I\u2019m tired of her not helping out anymore so she can start paying rent like we agreed when she moved here or she can start doing the bigger share of household chores.

This doesn't sound like a very good way to live.", "NTA\n\nShe's using you.... Whether she means to or not. You bought her a car and then allowed her to live in your home rent free for the last year and a half.... The fact that she isn't contributing anything financially is not cool at all.

Either leave her or accept the situation since she has shown you her true colours. She is living the life she wants enabled by you supporting her. A decent human being would have done all they can to get a full time job and shared the household chores with you, unfortunately you have been taken for a one sided ride here.", "NTA\n\nYou need to set firm boundaries. She needs to be contributing X amount by Y date or find a place of her own. Trading chores for rent will not make you feel equal. I personally would stop paying for dates and vacations until she picks up the slack or you come to a new agreement. She clearly can't afford to travel if you're paying for everything.\n\nThis all changes if this is a lifetime/longterm relationship and you want to accept caring for her financially as part of it.  But in a basic bf/gf scenario she's out of line.\n\nShe also sounds possibly depressed. Moving a long distance can be depressing in ways you never anticipated. It happened to me, to my BIL, to my mom... It's a big adjustment. I'd encourage her to see her doctor about this. But, in the meantime, she lives there too and needs to contribute financially and to the maintenance of the home.", "I mean she needs to GTFO if she's not going to contribute what she agreed to AND she's not going to participate in the household.

I can be just as bad or worse when I am going through a mental health episode so I relate to the description of her. You're not wrong, but she might need help. She also has to want to get help, if that is the case, and that part is 100% on her.", "You\u2019ve allowed her to ignore your agreement for this long, and so you\u2019ve shown her that she can get away with doing far less than she agreed to do.

On the other hand, she might feel legitimately aggrieved that you\u2019re suddenly changing the rules and expectations. \n\nUsually, in the \u201cwhat\u2019s expected\u201d fight, the tie goes to the \u201cwhat is / isn\u2019t enforced\u201d rather than \u201cwhat\u2019s written down\u201d, morally. In effect, by not enforcing the agreement, you showed her with your actions that it wouldn\u2019t be enforced. In that sense, you\u2019re \u201cchanging the rules\u201d. \n\nSo, while any objective lens on fairness might be biased towards you, for agreeing to pay 75% and for having what most of us would hear as pretty low expectations, the fact that you\u2019ve set and enforced even lower expectations mean that you\u2019re at least partially on the hook for them. \n\nBecause you\u2019re just as responsible as your GF is for the status quo of her not meeting your stated but unenforced expectations, ESH.", "NTA.

She is showing you exactly who she is, so believe her!", "NTA, your feelings are valid\n\nShe retired on you. Now she's upset that her retirement will be interrupted. Don't be a doormat, give her the ultimatum, 50/50 on everything, rent, utilities, work around the house. If she doesn't like it, tell her to kick rocks. There are many ladies who want a man who wants to live in a clean place, you'll find another.", "NTA- but your girlfriend is lazy as hell and you\u2019re just enabling her bad habits by paying for everything. 350 a month on her hourly wage is more than doable and she\u2019s just using you at this point", "Yup, how lazy. Definitely seems like she's using him for a free ride. Agree with above. NTA", "Perfectly summed up. Dump her before she ends up pregnant. . Hopefully the car is in your name. NTA", "If op comes to his senses to get her out he better stop having sex with her or she will try to baby trap him", "Came here to say this. RUUUUUUUNNNNNNN", "She's basically not his girlfriend but his kid. He does everything for her and even bought her a car.", "I agree that these are the only two options. Maybe I\u2019m a little too pessimistic, but it really doesn\u2019t seem like this is a simple misunderstanding, or that gf just doesn\u2019t realize how one-sided it is. She knows, and she is very clearly intentionally taking advantage of OP. She won\u2019t change.", "I agree. Would definitely try to rule out mental health/medical issues. I've had family members who tanked and they could not care for their surroundings. \n\nBut if it's not that or she refuses to make sure it's not something medical or mental preventing her from participating, move her out. It's an entitlement problem and will only get worse. Especially if you have unequal views of how the relationship should be functioning.", "She is a 36yo adult, she needs to adult, and look for a therapist as well. Most people these days have some kind of mental issue and do what it has to be done. This is not an excuse to burden everyone else.", "Which one?", "It\u2019s like boiling a frog (the metaphorical one, anyway). It happens gradually in real life so you don\u2019t notice how fucking ridiculous it all is until you\u2019re telling someone else and see the shocked look on their face.", "Thinking with his other head, probably.", "Excellent point. OP, don't leave responsibility for birth control up to your GF. I've known several women who 'accidentally' got pregnant when a relationship was on the rocks. Don't be naive.", "She wants a sugar daddy.", "Yeah, tbh she sounds a bit like me before I was diagnosed and medicated for adhd but I live alone so it wasn\u2019t an issue for someone else. Now I have no problems getting my chores done.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14t4a8n/aita_for_not_wanting_to_pay_rent_to_my_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1", "Very true! My pot didn\u2019t boil for 4 years, then all of a sudden it was spilling all over the place.", "and on top of that, the whole time youre expecting the hotplate to be turned off at some point", "I tend to give in to those that I love so I know how hard this can be."]}
