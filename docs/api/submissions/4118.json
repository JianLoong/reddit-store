My wife has 3 kids and while they are not biologically mine, I still care for them as though they are. So when purchasing a home I obviously have to look for something big enough to house 5 people and the pets. The loan is 100% in my name because her credit is still not great. She's working on it though. None of this really matters too much but they are little details regardless.\n\nNow when we were originally searching, a 4 bedroom was what we discussed. That way the kids could all have their own rooms. But I found a 3 bedroom that is absolutely gorgeous and I truly fell in love with it. It's a good size house. Bedroom sizes are decent, bigger than the rooms we have now. So I don't see an issue with the girls sharing a room like they are currently. They are still young anyhow. This house is $85k less than market value currently and I feel the need to jump on it. Something about the home is just drawing me in and I can't stop thinking about it. \n\nMy wife hates it. Not the house. She thinks the house is gorgeous as well but she is concerned about it only being 3 bedrooms. Says she doesn't want her kids sharing a room their entire childhood life because it's \"not fair\" and they deserve their own space. And I totally get that but realistically I could just build an addition in the future or even finish up the basement at some point to add an extra bedroom. Currently it's a dirt basement but I can re-do it. \n\nI ran these details by my wife and she just looked disgusted. Said that I was going back on our plans and that now she was going to have to deal with the backlash from the kids because they were excited about getting their own space and said I put her in a bad spot. She also made a comment about \"I don't feel comfortable putting a bunch of my money toward something that doesn't even fit my families needs\". But I'm dead set on this house and she thinks I'm an AH because she's not seeing it the way I am. AITA?\n\nETA: Clearing up some confusion on the money aspect of this. I've seen a lot of comments accusing her of not financially contributing, despite me saying she is pulling out of financially helping me providing I go for this house. She works, full time, over time, whatever. She owns her own real estate business and is fantastic at what she does. She makes more money than me. Almost $30k a year to be exact.", "created_utc": 1670362225, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zeip29/aita_for_going_against_my_wifes_wishes_when/", "score": 2724, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What is the long game? \n\nAre you buying a house with your money to split with your long term partner and her kids? Or are you buying a home with your family? \n\nI'm not suggesting either one is true or even optimal, honestly. Not everyone even wants one or the other. But don't tell her you want one thing, but then in your mind, you actually see it as the other thing.", "Yes YTA. The loan in your name means nothing if you're married. When my wife and i were buying our house we spoke at length and agreed to look for a house that met our wants and requirements. If I'd simply gone ahead and brought a different house I'd have been lucky if she moved with me. \n\nYou aren't wrong you can upgrade this house in time but that's not the point. The point that your wife is going to take away from this is you'll unilaterally make important decisions behind her back regardless of what she wants. She's your wife.

Overruling your partner in a large financial decision like this is a massive red flag and honestly might be a marriage breaker. If nothing else,  this makes you a colossal ah.\n\nAlso, speaking as a professional,  this is a terrible time to try to remodel a home.

You were very foolish to make an offer knowing she isn't happy with this house. You've tarnished the house completely because if you get it, she will move in with nothing but resentment and frustration. A house purchase requires two yeses. One no means no completely. There are other homes and the one that's right for *both* of you is still out there. How old are the kids because the only possible way I could see this working would be if you all sat down as a family, explained the situation, and got the kids' opinions *and* had a specific timeline for doing the add-on or basement refurbishment. Going in with an attitude of \"I can add on a room some day\" while vaguely gesturing around you won't work, man. ***You're not doing right by your family, regardless of how good your intentions are.*** YTA and will remain so as long as you don't withdraw your offer.

My wife has 3 kids and while they are not biologically mine, I still care for them as though they are. So when purchasing a home I obviously have to look for something big enough to house 5 people and the pets. The loan is 100% in my name because her credit is still not great. She's working on it though. None of this really matters too much but they are little details regardless.\n\nNow when we were originally searching, a 4 bedroom was what we discussed. That way the kids could all have their own rooms. But I found a 3 bedroom that is absolutely gorgeous and I truly fell in love with it. It's a good size house. Bedroom sizes are decent, bigger than the rooms we have now. So I don't see an issue with the girls sharing a room like they are currently. They are still young anyhow. This house is $85k less than market value currently and I feel the need to jump on it. Something about the home is just drawing me in and I can't stop thinking about it. \n\nMy wife hates it. Not the house. She thinks the house is gorgeous as well but she is concerned about it only being 3 bedrooms. Says she doesn't want her kids sharing a room their entire childhood life because it's \"not fair\" and they deserve their own space. And I totally get that but realistically I could just build an addition in the future or even finish up the basement at some point to add an extra bedroom. Currently it's a dirt basement but I can re-do it. \n\nI ran these details by my wife and she just looked disgusted. Said that I was going back on our plans and that now she was going to have to deal with the backlash from the kids because they were excited about getting their own space and said I put her in a bad spot. She also made a comment about \"I don't feel comfortable putting a bunch of my money toward something that doesn't even fit my families needs\". But I'm dead set on this house and she thinks I'm an AH because she's not seeing it the way I am. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Sure, sharing a room won\u2019t kill them, but one of the girls is already 11, soon she\u2019ll be needing and wanting a lot more privacy, and sharing rooms at those ages can really strain a relationship with kids in my experience sharing with a sibling, and everyone else I know.
