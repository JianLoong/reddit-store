You also did your due diligence here checking to see if you could schedule this.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy the cruise with your Granddaughter.\n\nI hope you have a great time\n\nBut expect ex DIL to be a major pain in the Arse over this.", "NTA\n\nAnd thank you for fighting for your granddaughter so she doesn't become a glass child because of her mother. You are absolutely doing good.", "NTA. \n\nEven if there weren't these health and fairness issues, it would be totally appropriate to do something just to celebrate your granddaughter. \n\nMy grandparents and other family did stuff with each one of the kids separately. My sister got to go away with my grandparents- she was the oldest and they were driving and had room for only 1 kid- and later in life, I got a trip too. It wasn't the same trip, but it was comparable. \n\nKids are not treated the SAME in life due to age, interests, and resources. They should be treated fairly- aka you got them both good christmas gifts and your granddaughter is getting a trip as her present AND to celebrate graduating. When your grandson graduates, you can offer him a trip or something else that interests his as much as a vacation would your granddaughter. But that doesn't happen NOW, it happens when the milestone happens. \n\nKids who don't understand that, or worse, the parents who don't, grow up selfish and entitled. It wasn't that hard for me to understand my sister got a car at 16 and I had to wait, or that she would get to do other things before me. Similarly, I traveled for school stuff, so I got opportunities she didn't get and while we may have been jealous (I wanted to be 16 and have the freedom of a car) we didn't think it was unfair.", "I went on a cruise with my grandmother when I was 14, I'm now 48 and I still remember that time with her. Have an amazing time with your granddaughter!", "NTA, what a lovely gift. DIL can\u2019t impose her views on you.", "NTA. You found gifts they like.", "NTA - way to spend quality time w your grand daughter. Enjoy it. You did something ostensibly nice for both of them .. and that\u2019s pretty cool.", "Nta they both got damn nice gifts.  It's not like she got a cruise and he got a pack of socks.", "NTA!\n\nMy grandmother took me and all of my cousins on separate trips when we graduated high school. It was a special thing for each of us to do together with her. My sister went on the trip with grandma alone two years after I went with her (+ my cousin, but we're the same age, so it just worked out that way). It's a /graduation/ gift, kids graduate at different times.\n\nI'd think about doing something nice, one on one, with your grandson when he graduates middle school, but in the meanwhile, I don't see any issues here (on your end).\n\nHave fun on your trip!", "NTA\n\nBut since cruises all have an international stop. Who has the child\u2019s passport?", "NTA - please do this for her.  And please keep it about her graduation so that it doesn't divide the siblings further.  Let the ex-DIL that once son is graduating middle school you will figure out something for him too.  Thank you for being there for your granddaughter.", "INFO:  What health issues does your grandson have?\n\nAlso, what do you mean by your ex-DIL has been neglecting your granddaughter due to your grandson\u2019s health issues?  For example, is it due to your ex-DIL needing to take your grandson to medical appointments, hospital admissions, etc.?\n\nWhile I can understand your granddaughter\u2019s frustrations over this, there are still 2 children at play.  Not sure if your ex-DIL is just focusing her attention on her son because she feels he needs her more or because he does not have much time left (even just a few years) due to his health issues.  \n\nPersonally, I think this is above an AITA question.  Maybe, you could start doing separate routine (even monthly) activities with your two grandchildren.  Based on what you have mentioned about your grandson\u2019s health issues, I can understand your ex-DIL feeling bad thinking of her son seeing/hearing about all of the fun things his sister\u2019s doing that he is physically unable to do.  (Maybe, if you start doing separate activities with him versus with his sister your ex-DIL will be more open to her daughter doing more activities without her brother needing to be included in them.)\n\nIt seems more like both you and your ex-DIL both need to understand more that there are two children involved and to look at things more from the other child\u2019s perspective.  Not once in this post have you mentioned how your grandson feels about any of this.  Obviously, your ex-DIL needs to focus more on her daughter and making her feel loved and important.", "You need to be more generous with your former daughter in law.  Book her an all expenses paid to beautiful, scenic Antarctica.", "NTA -- and this is likely going to get worse. please be there for the girl.", "NTA- good on you for recognizing that your granddaughter is being pushed to the side and making sure she's being seen and valued by someone in her life. Sounds like ex-DIL is enabling and dismissing your grandsons bad behaviour due to his heath issues. Continue to support your granddaughter in any way you can. She's going to need it as clearly she's not getting it from her own mother", "What are the grandson's health issues. They are close in age. All he will remember is that his grandmother does not want to spend time with him. The switch is so old that if he doesn't already have one he never wanted it. They are inexpensive at this point. Doubt the cruise was cheap. I know you may feel bad for your granddaughter, but you're over correcting at this point. It's a tough situation, but your grandson will eventually want nothing to do with you if you continue down this path. NAH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA.  \n\nYour granddaughter is actually running into something that is not uncommon.  When a kid has a disability, the kid's parents want to make sure that the kid with the disability never feels excluded because of the disability.  \n\nThis leads to unfortunate situations for the kid's sibling.  Where, for example, in an ordinary family you would think nothing of a grandparent taking only one kid ice skating if the other hates the activity, in a family where one child has a disability, the is the added layer of making the disabled feel excluded.  \n\nThis leads to a situation where the sibling without the disability feels neglected, or feels they are unable to do fun activities they enjoy because of the need to accommodate the other sibling.  \n\nOn top of that, the non-disabled sibling feels like they can't express their feelings because that would hurt the younger sibling or be exclusionary.  \n\nOver a lifetime, this can create resentment that will color the relationship between the siblings, and it can carry into adulthood.", "Get her tickets to pet the pretty bears"]}
