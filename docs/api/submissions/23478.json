I'm not really sure what went down, but afaik they had separate finances, so I don't think it would be due to money reasons. \n\nWhen I told my family we had received a donation to my daughters college fund everyone was overjoyed.. but also really suspicious, because there are times in the last few years that money would have really helped. Someone in my family started the \"joke\" that I got this from my boss for \"favours\". It's not true, but my sister and brother won't let it go. \"Let's get takeout tonight, hey, X, go sleep with your boss and get it\". I'm not doing a good job of explaining it but its really quite hurtful to have my family saying these things, even as jokes.\n\nI'm considering telling them BIL is the one behind it.

This should only be a secret if he wants it kept a secret, otherwise you need to tell your children so they can thank their uncle.", "Another family issue started  because people can't just keep quiet. Nothing had to be said.  If someone  asked, just say scholarships and grants, even loans", "can someone please help me pay my rent i promise i can get in contact and pay you back right away once i get it cause i don\u2019t get paid till next week and i\u2019m scared i don\u2019t know what to do anything helps please \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb i promise i\u2019m not scamming i just don\u2019t know where to turn to anymore", "NTA\n\nStop discussing your finances with family. Or anyone but a financial advisor. Should have just kept it to yourself.\n\nIt's none of their business, but you opened your mouth and opened yourself to attack.

Then do just that.**", "I would have said she received a grant, not a donation. They are going to accuse you one way or the other. If they keep pushing just tell them it was anonymous and even you don't know.", "Yep This \u2b06\ufe0f They will turn to potentially even blaming you for the divorce so fast that you're head will spin. \n\nMy advice is to keep your finances to yourself in the future as especially since their money was separate, it's nobody's business where it comes from.", ">You went naked skydiving for a bet.\n\nNo need to keep changing anything. I'd pick this one and it'd be my new truth!", "I found it in a boating accident.", "No no no. They don\u2019t deserve the truth. It is none of their business.", "Exactly, I\u2019ve started using the \u201cI don\u2019t get it\u201d line and it usually works great. When you have to explain your \u201cjoke\u201d it\u2019s no longer funny", "I would just go with it \"why did you tell them?\" She didn't need to disclose anything!", "My thought too\u2026 why not just say it was a scholarship?", "Agreed. OP, what good came from volunteering this information?? Of course your family would inquire and want to know more. \n\nNext time, keep it to yourself!", "Right. Next they will say you slept with BIL which is why he gave your kids money, and that you ruined your sister\u2019s marriage. Then there will be a round of paternally testing to see if BIL fathered your children. Still want to tell your family it was BIL ? Perhaps just FIRMLY ask your family to stop projecting their slutty thoughts on you ?", "Well if the sister treated her ex the same way she\u2019s treating her sister, I think I can guess why he would leave her.", "We live with my parents.. it would be hard to not tell them my daughter is going to college", "He didn't do it for OP, the kids were his niblings-in-law, he was their uncle and he did it for them.", "Some families don\u2019t work that way. Some be nosey AF and know you didn\u2019t have money two months ago, so have a slew of direct questions. Also the Venn diagram of family members who do this and family members willing to insult their kin under the guise of joking is damn near a circle.", "He didn't ask her to keep it private, she asked him.", "Are you even reading", "When your other child goes to college I would not tell them about the college fund. Your finances is not their business, just let them assume your child took out student loans like most of kids. I never share my finance information with my family.", "Why did you tell them about the money?  Only your kids needed to know.  \n\nNow they'll all come asking you for money expecting you to have some lying around.  Or they'll ask for some of the fund.\n\nThey'll pressure the kids going \"hey you aren't so selfish that you wouldn't get your mom to give me the money for XYZ right?  You can work but we need the money now for reasons!\"   You just tossed your kids as targets for family to squeeze.", "Why tell them anything? Ever? Why can't your kids go to school with whatever funds are available and offer no info on how you paid for it?\n\nI miss the days when shit like how you paid for college, that new house or car, or anything was personal and not discussed in general.\n\nAfter reading AITA for a while, I've realized that if everyone would just stfu regarding controversial, private and personal info, everyone worldwide would be happier.", "I think it is actually very nice of your ex-bil  to help you out.", "I suppose one way out is just to come up with a plausible alternative story.\n\nOne that comes to mind... Let's say you won a five figure amount from a lotto ticket. Since you're a good parent, you wanted to use 100% of the post-tax winnings for your kid's education, and you follow the standard advice of telling NO ONE where the money came from to avoid feelings of jealousy, requests for handouts and so on. Everyone knows you keep lotto winnings secret to avoid problems.\n\nSay they're all being assholes, you don't want to tell the truth but you're so fucking tired of the hurtful comments that fine, you'll tell them about the winning ticket. But just so they know, you're so pissed off at their rudeness that they sure as hell better not ask for any handouts since they definitely don't deserve any.\n\nBoom, problem solved.", "I wouldn't tell. Ur sister might feel entitled to to it, it could start a shitshow.", "Maybe just semantics but if you do tell anyone. I would say the \u201cchildren\u2019s uncle\u201d (just sounds better and puts a better frame on it than ex BIL) he divorced your sister but he was the children\u2019s uncle at the time and seems he is still fulfilling that role.", "She obviously doesn't care about your feelings", "For better impact, start an actual OF account, name it \u201cthe Golden Girl\u201d,  and make it all about tax breaks while saving for kids\u2019 college.", "Robbed an old conquistador\u2019s grave that may or may not have been cursed, time will tell.", "The Obsidian Order will be proud of you.

Afterwards you met now and then for lunch at a Mongolian grill and talked about books you\u2019ve both read. Unbeknownst to you his father had recently passed, leaving him a legacy. He had also been wrongly imprisoned for a time so your kindness touched him and he set up funds for your children, not having any of his own.", "Wouldn't they be going to college even if there was loans or they worked?   If they wanted to go, this fund would not be the deciding factor on if they went or not.  \n\nYou could have just said \"we figured it out\" and implied loans.", "Side note- if your sister gets upset enough, would your parents kick you out if they knew?   \n\nIt's likely that they'll think you're sleeping with the BIL for the money.  Can you afford to live somewhere else if they kick you out?", "But why? They aren't his blood and he just out of the blue decides to give money tom his ex's family? Just trying to understand.", "Even the kids don't need to know. Kids, like adults, can't keep their mouths shut. Send them to college, pay for it, keep the specifics to yourself.", "Yes, nice and generous, and the kids who are benefitting should be gracious, and keep their mouths shut outside the 4 people who know.", "Honestly, I would have just said daughter won a scholarship and then pretended son did the same when he went to college. With the lottery you run the risk of the family still pressuring you to use the money elsewhere.", "How about just letting people think that parents saved the money themselves? Who goes around asking how college was paid for anyway? 9 out of my 13 niece's and nephews have college degrees and I have no idea how any of it was paid for, because it's not my business!!!", "That's what I thought--say that your lottery ticket was a winner.", "Unexpected POTC?", "Just a humble seamstress.", "A party to an old class-action lawsuit. Or one of those state lists of people who have money coming to them that they don't know about.", "Just speculating\u2026maybe OP\u2019s sister couldn\u2019t have kids so this was ex BIL\u2019s way of providing for the children in his life even if they aren\u2019t his own???", "Well to some people blood isn\u2019t everything. Maybe he genuinely had good feelings for OP and kids as people. Also not everyone has bitter feelings over ex\u2019s family. \n\nI\u2019m trying to see if from both sides, yours included since I\u2019m actually from a culture that takes care of blood-related family even if they\u2019re the worst or did the pettiest, shitty things to you in the past. So I can see why you might be a little confused (?) if blood relations matter and effort/help given is determined by blood relations. But nah, there are many other factors that influenced his decision. There doesn\u2019t always have to be a conspiracy of bad intentions or anything.", "Just because you don\u2019t love the person you were with anymore, it doesn\u2019t always mean you stop loving the other people that were in your life for years. Presumably he cared/cares about OP and her family and he wants to make their lives easier. It\u2019s a really kind thing to do.", "For sure, yeah. This story was just the first one I thought of that also completely explains why OP might have hidden it at first. Hiding a scholarship and then admitting later wouldn't make sense, most parents would be proud of that and announce it immediately since it's basically a major achievement by their kids. OP's definitely got less believable options available after hiding the truth so insistently. I'm sure there's plenty of other options aside from a lotto though.", "Oh true. I was thinking more that initially I would have told them it was a scholarship rather than a donation. Not that it helps OP now. Maybe if she said it was an anonymous alumn donor from the school? So it\u2019s like a scholarship but also kind of a donation?"]}
