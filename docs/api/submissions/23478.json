I'm not really sure what went down, but afaik they had separate finances, so I don't think it would be due to money reasons. \n\nWhen I told my family we had received a donation to my daughters college fund everyone was overjoyed.. but also really suspicious, because there are times in the last few years that money would have really helped.

That is a suggestion that I can think of.  The amount of money doesn't matter.  Don't mention the amount.... \n\nBeyond this, stop talking about money to them.\n\nAlso, it is quite gross of them to shame sex work.  It is elitist of them really. \n\n Also, the detail of their assumption is quite messed up and can be damaging to your job if your boss hears about it.  This could cause some major trouble for you if their stupid assumptions got around.", "NTA whatever you choose. \n\nHowever, you don\u2019t have to reveal the source without shutting down their nasty comments.

They have proven to be quite untrustworthy with that kind of insight as it is.\n\nIf you are ever to mention your BIL's involvement, make sure that he's on board with it being revealed so he can brace for the potential drama and gossiping. Your family might make some inappropriate assumptions on why you got the money and you might regret them knowing anything at all. You don't have to disclose it, not even to your children - they can for instance get to know it somewhere down the line when it's all spent anyways and your family can't do much about it.\n\nIf you can be bothered, you could always have fun with your family and take the piss out of them with creative and outrageous stories on where the money came from. If you can't be bothered, disengage from them, let them know why, and refuse to engage with them until they stop spreading untrue and unprofessional stories about you. Either way of handling this is perfectly valid, and you should choose according to how you would like to deal with this, and what consequences there might be based on what your family is saying about you. If there is any way this might affect your work you should shut this down hard. But most importantly: stick with what you choose to do and don't back down or compromise on your boundaries.", "NTA.

He paid for kids that aren't even blood related and you're like thanks but fuck off", "My go to now. Never complain, never explain.", "Contrarian here.  I think your family should be told who supplied the money.  He deserves acknowledgment and thanks from your parents.  But only you know the level of seismic event your sister would create.

Those remarks are fucked-up.", "NTA but im just curious - why did you tell any of them in the first place? It\u2019s not really their business *how* you pay for your kid\u2019s college.", "NTA - Don't tell the truth. Honestly, I'd just embrace what they already think and tell them you slept with your boss. Just be so direct and explicit about it that it makes them uncomfortable to talk about. Then at least they'll stop trying to figure it out.\n\nAlso, you should make your daughter get a job anyways.
