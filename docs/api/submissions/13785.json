I had a middle seat between a young woman (20sF) in the window seat, and a woman (30sF) on the aisle. I'm tall and am never comfortable on planes. My knees always dig into the seat in front and it can be quite painful. I usually try to take a walk around the airport before flights to stretch my legs, but neglected to this time. It was Spirit airlines so even less legroom than usual.\n\nAbout half an hour after takeoff I found my left knee inching to the side for the sweet relief of open space -- specifically, the no-man's-land in between seats, level with the shared armrest. But I wasn't paying attention to my knee the entire time. I'll concede it's possible that at some point I was occupying space that rightfully belonged to my window seat neighbor. All was well for \\~2 hours.\n\nAt this point, the woman in the window seat called over the flight attendant. She asked her something like \"Could you tell him to keep his \\*\\*\\*\\*ing leg in his own \\*\\*\\*\\*ing seat.\" With horror, I understood she was talking about me. I instantly retracted my leg in deep shame. She added something about \"his enormous dick\" -- my understanding was that it was meant to be a snide reference to the idea that spreading your legs is about male genital comfort. But she wasn't speaking very clearly, and the flight attendant (50sF) didn't seem to understand her. The FA asked her some sort of clarifying question but she didn\u2019t answer and eventually the attendant went away.\n\nI had been shocked into silence, but when the FA left I frantically began to apologize. But she refused to speak to me. She acted like she didn't hear me. Instead she started furiously texting on her phone (yeah, texting during a flight. I thought it was weird too). Aisle Seat woman said she had some extra space on her side I could use, but then promptly went to sleep. Oh well.\n\nI tried again to apologize to Window Seat woman, but again she ignored me. I went from embarrassed to confused. I kept replaying it in my head, wondering why she didn't simply ask me to move my knee instead of calling over the attendant.\n\nI started sneaking peeks at her phone. My defense is that I was baffled by her behavior and wanted answers. I'll admit that I was being judgmental, too. Here's why: she spent the last 3 hours of the flight watching tiktoks about shaming obese people and texting someone she called papi. I didn't see all of it but a significant portion was definitely about me; she wrote \"Men really do be too much sometimes\" with a laughing emoji.\n\nShe ignored me the whole rest of the flight and I ignored her.

You know you're tall - be aware of those next to you. It's not their job to tell you they are uncomfortable as it can be really intimidating calling someone out, especially in an enclosed space like a flight - if you started acting like a dick to her, she's got nowhere to go for another 6 hours. \n\nThe snooping though.

If you can\u2019t fit in the seat you paid for, you need to pay for more space.

Those aren\u2019t the actions of an AH. \n\nOn the other hand, it sounds like you were pushy and invasive with the apology - she wasn\u2019t required to forgive you. The fact that you read her phone is also an AH move, though I certainly understand Spirit airlines shared some blame. \n\nShe\u2019s allowed to make fun of you with Papi and watch videos.

Not everything a man does is an intentional slight towards women, and kindness can go a long way. It sounds like he would have happily moved his legs if she'd asked, but instead she *chose* to make the situation much more uncomfortable than it needed to be.\n\nEdit: For all those downvoting me, I understand where you're coming from, I get that confrontation can be dangerous. However, I have a legitimate question for you. \n\nA while back I was on a plane seated next to a mother with a large toddler on her lap. She was polite, but made no effort to keep her child from making noise, constantly bumping into me, or interrupting me when I was clearly busy. In a very similar way she was invading my personal space and felt \"privelged\" to do so because of her status as a mother. Would I have been the asshole if I called over a flight attendant and acted the same way the woman in this story did?", "Yeah the snooping was not my finest moment for sure. And in future I'm definitely going to bite the bullet and shell out for a different seat. I've been uncomfortable but fine before so I foolishly thought it was okay but this time it was a perfect storm of long flight + no stretching beforehand + middle seat + the AH in front of me leaning back the whole time haha. \n\nSo how do you think I should act in future? The middle space isn't strictly mine but it isn't strictly hers either, it feels odd to ask her permission. What's the polite thing to do?", "I know it's hard to believe people on the internet, but all I can say is I made this post in good faith. I definitely didn't \"know I was in her space\" -- I thought I was taking up the middle space, maybe a naive assumption but not some weird power move. I definitely didn't \"hope she'd say nothing\" -- if she'd said something this whole thing would've been avoided! \n\n This is the first time anything like this has happened to me. I try to avoid touching anyone, I'm just big. On public transit I always sit legs together especially if it's crowded.\n\nI'm sorry you've had bad personal experiences with men, they suck. \n\nI appreciate you adding that asking makes you feel more comfortable.

There are definitely men who would take a polite request to keep their knees in their own space as somehow unreasonable.", "I didn't say anything about crossing your legs, just about holding your knees together", "No one except the AH mother would think you were an asshole in that situation.", "I think the bigger question is why should we have to.           Personally I don\u2019t like conflict and people don\u2019t always react nicely - even when asked politely.", "Ah, sexism\n\nI guess you can just block me then lmao", "Right, because she should be extremely aware of handling it in a way that he is comfortable with, to be courteous to him\u2026 But he doesn\u2019t need to be aware of where his body is physically in the presence of other people whose space he is taking and he should you know just get a gentle reminder because she owes him that. \n\nBut he doesn\u2019t owe her any consideration prior to some thing being wrong", "The man did immediately start badgering her and trying to invade her privacy once confronted.", "Maybe she went through a traumatic experience in the past, and is acting like an asshole to make sure he doesn\u2019t interact with her further. Maybe she didn\u2019t go through anything in the past but is still scared. Maybe she was doing what animals do when they\u2019re scared- making themselves look bigger.  \nOr maybe she\u2019s an asshole. The point is that we don\u2019t know her situation, and OP doesn\u2019t either. He should have left her alone when she made it clear that she wanted to be left alone.", "\u201cFemale\u201d \ud83d\udea9", "It's pretty clear from her hostile behavior that she was not scared of op. If she had been she wouldn't have wanted to stay next to him after confronting him. Imo the polite thing to do is to first ask, and then if you're ignored you can escalate. ESH", "If the woman was truly scared of being assaulted, she would not have been so hostile and accepted to continue sitting next time him afterwards. She was just being a dick", "My point exactly, both are assholes. He should of been a bit more conscious with the fact he\u2019s taller and knew and she could of simply asked like an adult", "Wait, does he mean 8 inches of empty space between them? If so, that's positively enormous in my flight experience hahaha\n\nI'm used to like 2-5 inches (and I'm a window seat person).\n\nFrankly it sounds even more ridiculous to me that the flight attendant was called over for this.", "You do indeed need to have airplane mode on, but you can turn your Wi-Fi on. Cellular stays off.", "I completely agree", "Would I be the asshole if I went straight to a flight attendant instead of politely asking the mother first? For the record I did neither, because escalating often just makes things worse.", "Because that's how you adult?! \n\nJesus..... You're always gonna find situations you're not comfortable in, or awkward, your whole life.\n\nWhy should you have to? Because everyone is different, and not everyone assumes the same and there's always gonna be conflicts, so you fuckin deal with it by addressing it head on.\n\nI feel like I'm talking to my 9 year old.", "Men commit 96% of all violent crime. Men kill women for rejecting them. Men kill women simply because they feel like it. Men assault and maim women because they feel like it. Men harass and intimidate women because they feel like it. Men are significantly stronger than women and pose a massive risk to their physical safety (whether or not they intend to cause harm their ability to do so is always there). Women who are harmed by men are blamed for not being careful enough more often than not. \n\nWoman decides to be cautious?... ah, sexism :)\n\nI bet you a hundred bucks that you're the sort of person who'd blame a woman for being murdered after rejecting a man because she wasn't nice enough in her rejection, didn't give him a chance, etc. Like I said, women can't win.", "r/whenwomenrefuse", "You just put a whole lot of words in my mouth.", "This, exactly. He didn't stretch his legs prior to the flight. He proceeded to spread his legs knowingly. Therefore it is his responsibility to check with her and he didn't.\nKnowing all this, that lady is either frustrated or upset, locked in her seat for a couple of hours. She didn't handle it \"well\", but who could really blame her.\nAlso, we know the story from OP's POV and I'm sure there's some distortion there, so I wouldn't be passing judgment on the woman.", "Badgering? Didn't he just apologize? Dude was a total ass for looking at her phone though, that was completely not okay", "He sucks the most, you second most, claiming to be a woman when you\u2019re a man.", "I don\u2019t think so what I understand and this is by my own experiences on buses trains and two flights is he spread out past his space into her seat she pushed away from him because it\u2019s fucking awkward and scary but got fed up.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable she didn\u2019t want to talk to him alone first because he might\u2019ve had creep vibes and from him saying he was reading her texts and shit (she was right on the money). People tend to lash out when scared or upset maybe it wasn\u2019t elegant of her but 2 hours is a long time to have someone in your space I would\u2019ve freaked too.", "WHAT. You're telling me, after all these years of thinking airplane mode means you can't use any form of Internet, data or WiFi, that you can still use WiFi?? This has blown my mind. My partner is going to be well chuffed \ud83d\ude02", "Nope. In fact, that's what you should do. She already knew how her child was behaving and didn't care. There's less of a chance for a confrontation going to the flight attendant.", "Really I didn\u2019t. I simply elaborated on things that probably make you uncomfortable\u2026 Hey, how does that feel?\n\nI bet not great, huh ?\n\nKind of the point.", "Idk I've been on tons of flights and her reaction seems extreme, especially considering how relaxed the person on the other side of OP apparently was.\n\nMost people on flights are pretty civil. I think it's relatively unlikely that OP would be simultaneously creepy enough for a reasonable person to feel unsafe in asking him to move while also not creepy enough for her to try and ask for some sort of change in seating.\n\nHe definitely shouldn't have been reading her texts of course.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also had flight situations where a stranger accidentally leaned onto me after they fell asleep. A small nudge and maybe an \"excuse me\" is enough to resolve 99.9% of spacing situations on a flight.", "Scary? Knees are scary? Y\u2019all need to get a grip lmao", "It\u2019s usually like $10 to use the wifi and the wifi is always crappy"]}
