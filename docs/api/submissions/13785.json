I had a middle seat between a young woman (20sF) in the window seat, and a woman (30sF) on the aisle. I'm tall and am never comfortable on planes. My knees always dig into the seat in front and it can be quite painful. I usually try to take a walk around the airport before flights to stretch my legs, but neglected to this time. It was Spirit airlines so even less legroom than usual.\n\nAbout half an hour after takeoff I found my left knee inching to the side for the sweet relief of open space -- specifically, the no-man's-land in between seats, level with the shared armrest. But I wasn't paying attention to my knee the entire time. I'll concede it's possible that at some point I was occupying space that rightfully belonged to my window seat neighbor. All was well for \\~2 hours.\n\nAt this point, the woman in the window seat called over the flight attendant. She asked her something like \"Could you tell him to keep his \\*\\*\\*\\*ing leg in his own \\*\\*\\*\\*ing seat.\" With horror, I understood she was talking about me. I instantly retracted my leg in deep shame. She added something about \"his enormous dick\" -- my understanding was that it was meant to be a snide reference to the idea that spreading your legs is about male genital comfort. But she wasn't speaking very clearly, and the flight attendant (50sF) didn't seem to understand her. The FA asked her some sort of clarifying question but she didn\u2019t answer and eventually the attendant went away.\n\nI had been shocked into silence, but when the FA left I frantically began to apologize. But she refused to speak to me. She acted like she didn't hear me. Instead she started furiously texting on her phone (yeah, texting during a flight. I thought it was weird too). Aisle Seat woman said she had some extra space on her side I could use, but then promptly went to sleep. Oh well.\n\nI tried again to apologize to Window Seat woman, but again she ignored me. I went from embarrassed to confused. I kept replaying it in my head, wondering why she didn't simply ask me to move my knee instead of calling over the attendant.\n\nI started sneaking peeks at her phone. My defense is that I was baffled by her behavior and wanted answers. I'll admit that I was being judgmental, too. Here's why: she spent the last 3 hours of the flight watching tiktoks about shaming obese people and texting someone she called papi. I didn't see all of it but a significant portion was definitely about me; she wrote \"Men really do be too much sometimes\" with a laughing emoji.\n\nShe ignored me the whole rest of the flight and I ignored her.

You know you're tall - be aware of those next to you. It's not their job to tell you they are uncomfortable as it can be really intimidating calling someone out, especially in an enclosed space like a flight - if you started acting like a dick to her, she's got nowhere to go for another 6 hours. \n\nThe snooping though.

They\u2019ve failed so far \n\nSorry you feel like you\u2019re taking up space, you literally can\u2019t help it. I wouldn\u2019t give too much thought to what some losers on spirit airlines have to say. You can lose weight, you can\u2019t change your height or leg length.", "I\u2019ve sat on planes next to morbidly obese people, men and women, and they are way more intrusive than just a tall person with long legs. \n\nI wasn\u2019t trying to make it a gender issue, the term \u201cmanspreading\u201d did it for me. Fat people and women in particular are deluded. They wear skimpy clothes, forcing strangers to see their fat clumps falling out of their booty shorts, they breathe heavily, they take up space, they literally weigh the plane down and are the reason we get charged so much for having checked luggage over 50 pounds. \n\nThey\u2019re a drag on society, but the dude with long legs, who literally can\u2019t help it that he\u2019s tall, is the asshole here, according to the comments. It\u2019s just kinda hypocritical to me and I was looking for some practical consistency", "You can share time on it? Don\u2019t use it the whole flight? All I\u2019m saying is no, the middle seat doesn\u2019t \u201cget\u201d the armrests.", "She literally didn't say that.", "There is a whole alpha man thing going on where they brag about their right to manspread.", "You can keep your legs in front of your own seat though, buddy. \n\nSo damned incompetent.", "So you're sexist and fatphobic.\n\nManspreading is an actual issue. And it is manspreading because women do not prop their legs open to take more space. But men do it often. And they can control it, but they choose not to, or make excuses when called out.\n\nSomeone's weight is not something they can help all the time. Medications/medical conditions make it harder to keep lower weights. \n\nAnd your comment on how you hate seeing women comfortable in their bodies because they happen to be fat is awful. People can wear whatever they want. You do not decide what people should wear to make you happt.", "Middle seat gets the armrests, because it is the only source of comfort in what is the most uncomfortable seat. Windows has a bit of space to lean into, and aisle gets to extend into the aisle. This is well known travel etiquette", "She didn\u2019t say those exact words, you got me. Thanks for adding to the conversation", "I\u2019ve literally never heard of it. No male in my life that I have ever known has ever mentioned something that stupid. If they did I wouldn\u2019t talk to them. \n\nI can almost guarantee OP doesn\u2019t share that viewpoint. Some women are proud to be fat, how is that relevant?", "Another woman who doesn\u2019t have a penis telling people with penises to keep their legs closer together. \n\nWhile you\u2019re at it, can you stop having periods so much too? Your constant bathroom trips and late night trips to 7/11 for tampons are an inconvenience for me. \n\nHow horrible does that sound?", "So lemme get this straight, you\u2019re making excuses for Fatties who have \u201cmedical conditions\u201d but not for dudes for having literal genitalia between their legs? You\u2019re such an open minded person, but you couldn\u2019t imagine having a penis for 5 seconds? You think men just do that to piss you off? \n\nYou seem like a very rational woman! Just like every other one I\u2019ve ever met :)", "Um. NO.\n\n\u201cIf you're stuck in the middle seat, you might be wondering who owns the armrests on a plane.\n\nHere's a hint: It's not you.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/advice/2020/09/18/airplane-etiquette-who-arms-the-armrests/3478678001/", "You're welcome! I love to interject whenever I see someone trying to willfully misinterpret someone's explanations so I'm glad you caught on!", "If your big giant dick is soooooooo fucking large you can\u2019t sit (it\u2019s not, I promise) then here\u2019s an idea\u2026..don\u2019t get on the damned plane. Buy two seats you kinda people loOoOoOoOoOove telling fat women to do that, so go for it. Spread all you want! \n\nI bet if this story was a fat woman in the next seat whose ass cheeks were encroaching on OP you\u2019d have a loud and clear opinion on who the asshole is.", "More rational than the man stating he is taking the immature route!", "Absolutely! Eat a salad for me, and I\u2019ll keep my legs closed. Deal?"]}
