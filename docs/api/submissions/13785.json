I had a middle seat between a young woman (20sF) in the window seat, and a woman (30sF) on the aisle. I'm tall and am never comfortable on planes. My knees always dig into the seat in front and it can be quite painful. I usually try to take a walk around the airport before flights to stretch my legs, but neglected to this time. It was Spirit airlines so even less legroom than usual.\n\nAbout half an hour after takeoff I found my left knee inching to the side for the sweet relief of open space -- specifically, the no-man's-land in between seats, level with the shared armrest. But I wasn't paying attention to my knee the entire time. I'll concede it's possible that at some point I was occupying space that rightfully belonged to my window seat neighbor. All was well for \\~2 hours.\n\nAt this point, the woman in the window seat called over the flight attendant. She asked her something like \"Could you tell him to keep his \\*\\*\\*\\*ing leg in his own \\*\\*\\*\\*ing seat.\" With horror, I understood she was talking about me. I instantly retracted my leg in deep shame. She added something about \"his enormous dick\" -- my understanding was that it was meant to be a snide reference to the idea that spreading your legs is about male genital comfort. But she wasn't speaking very clearly, and the flight attendant (50sF) didn't seem to understand her. The FA asked her some sort of clarifying question but she didn\u2019t answer and eventually the attendant went away.\n\nI had been shocked into silence, but when the FA left I frantically began to apologize. But she refused to speak to me. She acted like she didn't hear me. Instead she started furiously texting on her phone (yeah, texting during a flight. I thought it was weird too). Aisle Seat woman said she had some extra space on her side I could use, but then promptly went to sleep. Oh well.\n\nI tried again to apologize to Window Seat woman, but again she ignored me. I went from embarrassed to confused. I kept replaying it in my head, wondering why she didn't simply ask me to move my knee instead of calling over the attendant.\n\nI started sneaking peeks at her phone. My defense is that I was baffled by her behavior and wanted answers. I'll admit that I was being judgmental, too. Here's why: she spent the last 3 hours of the flight watching tiktoks about shaming obese people and texting someone she called papi. I didn't see all of it but a significant portion was definitely about me; she wrote \"Men really do be too much sometimes\" with a laughing emoji.\n\nShe ignored me the whole rest of the flight and I ignored her.

You know you're tall - be aware of those next to you. It's not their job to tell you they are uncomfortable as it can be really intimidating calling someone out, especially in an enclosed space like a flight - if you started acting like a dick to her, she's got nowhere to go for another 6 hours. \n\nThe snooping though.

Not everything a man does is an intentional slight towards women, and kindness can go a long way. It sounds like he would have happily moved his legs if she'd asked, but instead she *chose* to make the situation much more uncomfortable than it needed to be.\n\nEdit: For all those downvoting me, I understand where you're coming from, I get that confrontation can be dangerous. However, I have a legitimate question for you. \n\nA while back I was on a plane seated next to a mother with a large toddler on her lap. She was polite, but made no effort to keep her child from making noise, constantly bumping into me, or interrupting me when I was clearly busy. In a very similar way she was invading my personal space and felt \"privelged\" to do so because of her status as a mother. Would I have been the asshole if I called over a flight attendant and acted the same way the woman in this story did?", "Yeah the snooping was not my finest moment for sure. And in future I'm definitely going to bite the bullet and shell out for a different seat. I've been uncomfortable but fine before so I foolishly thought it was okay but this time it was a perfect storm of long flight + no stretching beforehand + middle seat + the AH in front of me leaning back the whole time haha. \n\nSo how do you think I should act in future? The middle space isn't strictly mine but it isn't strictly hers either, it feels odd to ask her permission. What's the polite thing to do?", "I know it's hard to believe people on the internet, but all I can say is I made this post in good faith. I definitely didn't \"know I was in her space\" -- I thought I was taking up the middle space, maybe a naive assumption but not some weird power move. I definitely didn't \"hope she'd say nothing\" -- if she'd said something this whole thing would've been avoided! \n\n This is the first time anything like this has happened to me. I try to avoid touching anyone, I'm just big. On public transit I always sit legs together especially if it's crowded.\n\nI'm sorry you've had bad personal experiences with men, they suck. \n\nI appreciate you adding that asking makes you feel more comfortable.

OP then snooping on what the woman he'd been harassing was doing on her phone is a third asshole move.\n\nOverall I don't entirely believe OP's claim of not having had the slightest clue his leg might be in someone else's space.

An exit row would only be around $40 extra. \n\nSo it sounds like you didn\u2019t want to pay anything extra and didn\u2019t give a thought to anyone else.

He seems to have a sense of entitlement, anger at being challenged, and an unhealthy level of vengefulness for being challenged. \n\nThe way I initially saw it: sure, it's his responsibility to book a seat that accommodates his size. So he's got asshole credentials for not doing that, and for making another passenger physically uncomfortable as a result. However if he had GENUINELY not noticed his manspreading (IF it actually was fleeting) - and he profusely apologised afterwards - he's still not off the hook in asshole terms. But not a total asshole.\n\nBut as soon as he said he was watching her Tiktoks for 3 HOURS and reading her texts - he's then a total asshole in my book. That's ridiculously intrusive. Indeed, I then thought about whether the rest of his story added up. It seems a bit of a strong reaction to go to the FA for a BRIEF and ACCIDENTAL period of 'manspreading' - and then completely refuse to speak to him (even as he's apologising). \n\nMaybe it did happen like that. But perhaps it WASN'T quite as 'brief' and 'unintentional' as he made out. He then tries to blacken her character further in our eyes, by claiming she was watching 'fat-shaming' videos for 3 hours. If she was actually doing that, obviously she has asshole credentials also. However, as I'm suspicious about whether he's minimising his own behaviour/exaggerating hers', I wonder if she truly WAS watching 'fat-shaming' videos. \n\nMaybe she was just watching discussions about weight loss, etc. - and he's twisted it as 'fat-shaming'. It's also not particularly relevant to the story, what she was watching on her phone. That's included purely to discredit her character. And indeed, the fact he was monitoring her private texts and videos for 3 HOURS \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, suggests a man who ISN'T scared of being intrusive. \n\nThat brings us back to the question, whether the original manspreading WAS actually unintentional. It also suggests some unhealthy resentment/anger about being challenged (to a point of near-obsessiveness), to monitor and judge what she was doing FOR THREE HOURS. \n\nI mean, WTF?!

And it shines through in how you chose to describe this encounter. Let's break this down:\n\n>A few months ago I (26M) was alone on a long flight, \\~6 hours. I had a middle seat between a young woman (20sF) in the window seat, and a woman (30sF) on the aisle. I'm tall and am never comfortable on planes. My knees always dig into the seat in front and it can be quite painful. \n\nKnowing this about yourself in advance, why would you not take extra steps to either book an aisle seat or fly an airline with more legroom? Why are you acting like this middle seat is something that just happened to you, and not something that you caused?\n\n>I usually try to take a walk around the airport before flights to stretch my legs, but neglected to this time.\n\nSo you realize that due to your own neglect, you are setting yourself up to be in pain for 6 hours. Cool. Let's keep that in mind moving forward.\n\n>It was Spirit airlines so even less legroom than usual.\n\nIf you knew that, then why are you even on that airline? Again, you put yourself in this situation.\n\n>About half an hour after takeoff I found my left knee inching to the side\n\nYou \"found it?\" Like it's a separate entity? You don't think you should be aware of what your own knee is doing? This is so mealy-mouthed it makes you seem like an asshole who can't take responsibility for himself.\n\n>for the sweet relief of open space -- specifically, the no-man's-land in between seats, level with the shared armrest.\n\nThere is no \"no man's land\" on Spirit Airlines. I know this. I know you know this. Everyone knows this. Again, here you're being disingenuous to avoid taking responsibility for your actions.\n\n>But I wasn't paying attention to my knee the entire time.\n\nYou 100% should have been. You know why women get so annoyed at men who \"don't pay attention\" to their own body parts? Because women are hard core socialized from a very young age to be very aware of exactly where all of our body parts are and how they are being seen at all times when we are in public cramped space. It's necessary when you have to spend your life trying to avoid getting groped/sexually harassed. So we really have no patience for men who have so much privilege that they don't have to think about this stuff at all, to the extent where their ignorance/indifference actively makes our situation worse.\n\n>I'll concede it's possible that at some point I was occupying space that rightfully belonged to my window seat neighbor. \n\nLike you don't even know? Bullshit. If you didn't know, that makes you even worse, because you should have known.\n\n>All was well for \\~2 hours.\n\nNo it wasn't. You were just too oblivious and entitled to realize that you were being an asshole for 2 hours.\n\n>At this point, the woman in the window seat called over the flight attendant. She asked her something like \"Could you tell him to keep his \\*\\*\\*\\*ing leg in his own \\*\\*\\*\\*ing seat.\" With horror, I understood she was talking about me. I instantly retracted my leg in deep shame. She added something about \"his enormous dick\" -- my understanding was that it was meant to be a snide reference to the idea that spreading your legs is about male genital comfort. \n\nAfter 2 hours of you smashing her into a corner and rubbing your leg against her like a total creep, she finally had enough and decided to speak up. 100% she was side-eyeing you and sending you signals to move your goddamn leg, but you either didn't pick up on them or chose to ignore them. She can't know which. What she does know is that she is seated next to an asshole with no regard for social norms who is bigger and stronger than her, when social norms are all that is protecting her from physical violence from you for the next 4 hours. I absolutely understand why she appealed to an authority figure in this case. She was right to do so.\n\n>But she wasn't speaking very clearly, and the flight attendant (50sF) didn't seem to understand her. The FA asked her some sort of clarifying question but she didn\u2019t answer and eventually the attendant went away.\n\nThis seems like a massive cop out on your part. You were sitting between her and the FA and you couldn't understand the convo? Sus.\n\n>I had been shocked into silence, but when the FA left I frantically began to apologize. But she refused to speak to me. She acted like she didn't hear me. \n\nShe did not want to talk to you because she thought you were an asshole. She has no obligation to talk to you. You are not owed the opportunity to apologize. Just keep your legs to yourself and leave. her. alone.\n\n>Instead she started furiously texting on her phone \n\nYes. Reporting your creepy behavior to whoever is picking her up at the airport in case you decide to escalate/follow her is the correct thing to do here.\n\n>(yeah, texting during a flight. I thought it was weird too). \n\nThe only reason it's weird is because the wifi that you can purchase on Spirit is expensive. If she wasn't texting before this point, then 100% she paid for wifi so that she could tell whoever was picking her up to look out for you. Your, at best, \"inattention\" to your own fucking leg cost her money.\n\n>Aisle Seat woman said she had some extra space on her side I could use, but then promptly went to sleep. Oh well.\n\nShe has probably been in the shit situation you were putting window seat woman in and was trying to help window seat woman. Super weird how all of your \"manspreading\" was into the younger woman's space and not the older woman's space. She \"fell asleep\" to gracefully give you an out.\n\n>I tried again to apologize to Window Seat woman, but again she ignored me.\n\nSHE DOES NOT WANT TO TALK TO YOU, DUDE.\n\n>I went from embarrassed to confused. \n\nHow did you get all the way to the age of 26 without ever being told \"no\"?\n\n>I kept replaying it in my head, wondering why she didn't simply ask me to move my knee instead of calling over the attendant.\n\nBecause you are bigger and stronger than her, and you just made it abundantly clear for 2 hours that you can't pick up on social cues and don't give a shit about social norms or the comfort of others.\n\n>I started sneaking peeks at her phone.\n\nSo you're a creep.\n\n>My defense is that I was baffled by her behavior and wanted answers. \n\nYou are not entitled to answers, and the fact that you think you are makes you a scary creep.\n\n>I'll admit that I was being judgmental, too. Here's why: she spent the last 3 hours of the flight watching tiktoks about shaming obese people and texting someone she called papi. I didn't see all of it but a significant portion was definitely about me; she wrote \"Men really do be too much sometimes\" with a laughing emoji.\n\nShe one thousand percent knew that you were peeping her phone and selected content that would SEND YOU A MESSAGE. Body shaming people who spread into others' spaces? check. Talking about oblivious men? check. Talking to someone who you would perceive as an older male figure in her life? check. You cannot actually be this dense.\n\n>She ignored me the whole rest of the flight and I ignored her. \n\nNo you didn't. You STALKED HER like a total creep. You intimidated her. You invaded her privacy. You are the worst.\n\n>I got a good but painful workout of whatever muscle it is that keeps your knees together.\n\nGood. Maybe work on that muscle some more. Sounds like you need it.\n\nYou really need to have a long, hard think on just how much of a creepy, rude, entitled stalker you were to this woman. Asshole.", "AITA for manspreading...\n\nYes. Don't even need to hear the rest of the sentence, it's a yes. Keep in your own seat and respect other people's personal space. The circumstances don't matter. What other people were doing don't matter.\n\nIf the seat is too small for you, buy a better seat. It's your problem, no one else's. Stop manspreading, it's incredibly selfish.\n\nYTA", "OP totally added the \u2018big dick\u2019 part, which I\u2019m 99% sure didn\u2019t happen.", "Omg same!! I am especially territorial over arm rest space when I\u2019m in the middle. I\u2019ll happily knock a businessman\u2019s arm off the rest. Once I was trying to sleep and the man next to me kept trying to turn on my reading light bc his was broken without asking me.", "It hurts if someone scrapes a shoe down your shin. Just random information\u2026", "I am a tall woman who still gets her leg space encroached upon, even in the exit row. The last flight I was on, the guy in the middle seat put his foot in my footwell. Sir, absolutely not. There\u2019s a significant portion of the population who is just counting on women not to say anything.", "I agree, I was ESH until I read the snooping part", ">\tLast time I was on a plane train a taller woman had herself pretty much wrapped around the pole, making it impossible for anyone else to hold onto it without making contact with her. \n\nI hate pole huggers so much. There are the full body drapers that somehow use all four arms and legs, and then the ones that use the pole as a head to toe leaning post, sticking their feet outward and bracing them at an angle, just to take up extra room. \n\n>\tI said excuse me, stuck my arm between hers to reach the pole, and she stared at me the entire time as though I were committing a grave sin.\n\n\nYou were not. I\u2019ve experienced this as well and it\u2019s so rude. If someone denies you the ability to hold on to a device aboard a moving train that was specifically placed there for people to hold on to in order to avoid falling, they\u2019re being rude. And you have every right to reach or ask or just plain grab the pole even if that means your knuckles end up in the person\u2019s back or whatever, and they give you a dirty look. The dirty look is basically them doubling down on rudeness. Peak awfulness.", "All this \u201cjustification\u201d of his actions makes him look like a bigger asshole. As a smallish woman with a husband who\u2019s 6\u20194\u201d, I\u2019ve experienced the discomfort of being encroached upon by men in airplanes, and my husband is considerate enough to always book an aisle or upgraded seat. These men operate entirely on the premise that the woman they\u2019re encroaching upon isn\u2019t going to speak up or call them out.", "Yes! If someone starts spreading their legs into my area, I just spread mine too so we can uncomfortably be touching. Usually works.", "I just kick them in the shins. Seems to get the point across", "Im a little bit tall as a woman and have long legs and that's exactly what I do back I will push back lol.", "I reclaim my space in retaliation too, but I like to wait until they doze off first, and then \"accidentally\" bump into them -  not gently - and them smile sweetly and \"apologize.\"", "I did this once. In the moment when my neighbour (a young, slim man) in the aisle seat removed his arm from the shared arm rest (his elbow poking over to my side, so even less room for me), I swooped in and put my elbow there. He squirmed and was visibly uncomfortable for 5 minutes, trying to get comfy with his arm pinned to his side like I had been doing, at which point I thought I\u2019d made my point, and removed my arm. It was less than 10 seconds before his arm was back on that arm rest. He really thought he was entitled to that arm rest. \n\nThis was years ago and I\u2019m still not over it.", "I also bring this level of rage. I purposely seek out man spreading men on the train and sit as close to them as possible.", "My sister puts her laptop vertically next to the armrest/seat border as a physical boundary against seat spreaders.  She says it works wonders!  \n\nBut small ladies out there, it isn't just you, since the number of manspreaders I've had to deal with is enormous as well.  Small comfort, I know.  But as a 6'3/260 pound guy, just shoving back usually works for me.", "I\u2019m a small woman, but, I always pay for a window seat. Now, I will only fly comfort +, bc I\u2019m sick of these giant cheapskate men spreading out in their middle seat into my space.

I hate the middle and will pay more for an aisle seat.", "I have nothing against knees in the back of the seat because being tall is out of someone's control. You can also call the airline and let them know beforehand. My brother is 6'8\", and when he had to fly from LaGuardia to Sea-Tac, he let them know while booking, and they ended up keeping the seat in front of him empty so he wouldn't have to worry about bothering someone by pressing his knees again their back.", "My husband doesn\u2019t like his ears being touched (or kissed) and he has this running (it\u2019s been 30 years) joke about how he can\u2019t see them so who knows where they\u2019ve been most of the day - they might be filthy. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t seem to realize this is a joke and not how bodies work.", "Obviously the aggressive profanity and insulting him was completely fine because a flight attendant was called over.\n\nClearly, if she had politely mentioned it once to him at all he would have promptly torn her throat open with his bare hands like at the end of Road House before anyone could stop him.", "Yeah, affecting other people\u2019s safety for your own convenience ain\u2019t it. Every other pole in the car had 5-6 people holding it, idk why she thought this was appropriate. I\u2019m all for not encroaching on other people\u2019s space as much as possible, but when you\u2019re in a public place intentionally preventing others from looking out for their own safety, you can die mad.", "Better yet, what if it had been another woman she was texting? How would he feel then?", "I think you're right.\nI'm not even tall and at this point, it's still uncomfortable.\nAnd you can't have your tray table down if the person in front of you reclines.

At least I know it's more likely we'll all stay in our own space and if an accident happens, much more likely to genuinely be an accident resolved with a brief apology.", "Yea, if it's friends/family, that's one thing (for me anyway) but not a total stranger. I don't know why they think its ok lol.", "They are definitely no frills, but I went on my first Spirit flight a few weeks ago and it wasn\u2019t really that bad.   We paid for an exit row and luggage and our flight was still 1/3 the price that Delta was charging.   It\u2019s worth being a little uncomfortable when you\u2019re saving that much money.", "Everyone flying Spirit has to embrace the suck. Misery is cheap, comfort costs extra.", "Yeah, that happened to me too. I didn\u2019t move my leg or anything, I just kept them firmly in the position I had before he sat down and tried to manspread. Man thought I was flirting and started grinding his leg towards mine and groping my waist with his hands.

I had no idea how it was supposed to work!", "This subreddit in general really highlights how 90% of commenters don\u2019t regularly interact with the outside world in any kind of normal way. It feels like they have no control over their own lives and project that insecurity onto every op that asks a question. It\u2019s weird. The woman in the window seat definitely frequents this sub.", "Although a good solution for women, how pathetic is it that men can\u2019t keep their hands to themselves for the short amount of time that it takes to ride the train? So little self control?"]}
