You should definitely go to the police with the device if it happens again. Let them sort her out.", "OP, I'm going to skip TA evaluation and get straight to the point. I have four pieces of advice that I feel are extremely important to you, right now.\n\n1) Take everything you see on reddit with a grain of salt. Any decision you make regarding this situation can have consequences that us strangers cannot predict, because we don't know everything about your life. Tread carefully before doing something you cannot take back.\n\n2) There are a number of things you can do to be prepared for legal action without actually taking it right now. I am not a lawyer, but a strict reading of most of the recording laws in the US tells us that audio recording any party without being present is most likely illegal. Furthermore, once you become aware of the recording device, there are likely circumstances where you can be considered an accessory to an illegal recording crime. The following steps are my advice based on the principle of Cover Your Ass:\n\n- Regularly screen your belongings for recording devices, and remove them when they are found. Do everything in your power to ensure that you detect these items before you bring your things into others' private spaces, including anywhere on campus.\n\n- Document everything. If you discover a device, take pictures of it. Use multiple angles, capture any identifying markings especially brand or serial numbers or barcodes, and show where the device was placed amongst your belongings. Keep a note of when it was found. Screenshot any text arguments you have with her over this subject. If you rebuke her verbally, immediately take a private note of the date, time, and content of the disagreement. Don't fill in details with guesses; simply record what you remember being said by both you and her and mention whenever you can't remember specifics. Make backups of everything you document. Email to yourself or save on multiple devices, or both. As a side note it's better, even if you don't want to, to keep a cool head when having these disagreements, even if she doesn't deserve politeness.\n\n- Do NOT tamper with, dismantle, destroy, or discard the devices. This is tempting, but it hurts more than it helps. Return the device to her EXCEPT if you suspect that the device was on your person while you were in a private space. IF that is the case, you will want to consult a lawyer before returning the device.\n\n3) If you decide to make this a legal issue, an in-person consultation with a local lawyer is the best first thing you want to do. This issue might not be that serious if it _only_ affects you and you feel that you can put up with it for now, but if it could affect someone else, then you should strongly consider a lawyer.\n\n4) Finally, from my personal opinion having been raised by and witnessed friends raised by parents like this, I hope I can offer some moral support.\n\n- Putting aside legality, recording you like this is an invasion of privacy and morally bankrupt. It _isn't normal_, and you might know that based on talking to friends but somewhere inside you think that in your situation it's reasonable. It's not.\n\n- Even if her suspicions about you are valid (I don't know if they are or not, I don't know you), she would _still!_ not be right. She would still not be justified.\n\n- Do not allow her opinions about what is or isn't responsible behavior dictate your actions. That works in both ways: don't do something risky for your future _just_ to spite her, and don't follow through on your education _just_ to prove her wrong somehow. She's not the person you have to look out for. You are.\n\nGood luck to you. Be careful, look out for yourself, think things through, and know that you deserve to be treated better.", "NTA.
