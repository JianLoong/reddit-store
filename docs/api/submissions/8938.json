She also decided to see a therapist. \n\n\nAs most of the comments suggested I talk to my brother and parents about SIL's behavior. It have been a week and we are all doing mostly good, my SIL have her first therapy session, she finds it nerve wrecking but believes it'll be effective. She tells me that she would randomly think about my boyfriend's diagnosis and get all anxious and whenever she caught herself getting anxious over this she played Tavern music and draw a medieval town (i don't know the exact term) which seems to work really well to soothe her. She also gets a better sleep and the baby is healthy. \n\n\n\nI have read all the comments in my original post though I disagree with some of the comments about my SIL, I agree that I was at fault for not setting boundaries and lying to her about my relationship. I am truly grateful for all the advices and it was such a great insight and motivation to read about people who are in a similar situation as me and my BF\n\n\n\nI also apologize to my BF for disrespecting ourrelationship.  We both agree that we should no longer disclose his diagnosis to anyone, unfortunately we have to change our couple therapist and it's hard finding a new one. Apart from that things are going well and last Friday I formally met his family for the first time, which goes beyond my expectation. \n\n\n\nAgain I would like to say thank you all for your support and advice.", "created_utc": 1675339353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ro818/update_aita_for_refusing_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 189, "replies": ["[Original post for Thirsty Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jcy8w/aita_for_refusing_my_brother_and_his_pregnant_wife/)", "Did SiL ever discuss *why* she was so invested in your relationship with your bf? Is it just because of his diagnosis then? The whole thing is a bit bizarre to me honestly, and I did read the OP. Is she older than you? Maybe just suffering from prenatal anxiety?", "Thank you for the update.  \n\nDon't worry about the negative comments you received.  Sounds like you all are working through this.  Essentially, this is all on her as it is HER issue and a weird one.\n\nIf it happens again, go low or no contact with SIL and tell your brother why.", "Link to original post:\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jcy8w/aita\\_for\\_refusing\\_my\\_brother\\_and\\_his\\_pregnant\\_wife/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jcy8w/aita_for_refusing_my_brother_and_his_pregnant_wife/)", "My theory is that she wanted to use OP as free childcare because bOnDiNg time, but she is scared of OP's bf", "Yeah I thought of that too, especially when she asked her to move in. SiL knew that if op moved in, the bf would be around", "The one person that needs to know your boyfriend's diagnosis is your therapist so I hope that's not why you're changing.", ">unfortunately we have to change our couple therapist\n\nWait, are you changing your couples therapist so you can hide his diagnosis? **Please** do not do that, it is incredibly important for the medical professional providing services to you to know about any mental health diagnoses in order to properly help you.", "What was the diagnoses?", "Our therapist have sadly passed away just a few days ago. May their soul be in peace.", "Anti-Social personality disorder", "Oh gosh, I'm so sorry!", "Oh man I thought she meant autism spectrum disorder in the first post! \n\nAnti-social personality disorder kinda changes  things, since it's a mental illness that literally causes you to lack regard for the safety of yourself and others...", "The only thing I find you an asshole about and still consider you an asshole about, is how you refused to stand up and still are refusing to stand up for your boyfriend.\n\nYou did an entire theatrics about \u201cbreaking up\u201d and now excusing her behavior cause \u201cyou know her\u201d. \n\nYou boyfriend deserves better. Someone who isn\u2019t ashamed of him and is willing to put people in their place. Someone who doesn\u2019t make excuses for their poor behavior towards boyfriend. He deserves way better.\n\nEdit: I know he doesn\u2019t have the best diagnosis and it can be scary, but it seems like he is working on it. It would be one thing if he didn\u2019t give two-fucks. But he is working on it, and that is why I think he deserves better in a partner.", "Your SIL might find the game Pentiment relaxing.", "First of all, our 'fake breakup' was me telling my SIL (and only her) we breakup. The one who came up with the idea was my BF, and I acted on that idea, both the idea and action was really stupid in hindsight. \n\n\nSecond, I don't know which part of my post can be interpret as me excusing my SIL behavior. I don't condone any of her actions regarding this situation, stating what might be the reasons for her actions is not the same as excusing her actions. Yes she did a shitty thing but that doesn't mean I have to shame and burn her for it. It's me and my BF's choice to give her the chance to grow. We are trying to have a healthier relationship and set boundaries with both of our family, which again is what me and my BF wanted.\n\n\nAnd lastly, saying I'm ashamed of my BF is a fucking reach. I don't even know how you came up with that conclusion. I think it might be the 'decide to not disclose his diagnosis anymore' part, we made this decision because disclosing his diagnosis will likely bring no good, instead he'll be scrutinized and ostracized.", "I'll tell her about it. :)", "Not if she's got an anxiety disorder and is pregnant.\n>Pentiment contains public executions, stylized gore, suicide, references to abortion, frequent strong language, references to sexual assault, and references to sexual activities.", "Yeah but the SIL could have kept her distance and kept the child at the a distance. \n\nMoreover, with psychotherapy it is manageable. The boyfriend is actively working on it. \n\nI don\u2019t think it is fair to be shun the boyfriend on this factor for something that is (1) developed through bad/traumatic childhood life experiences and (2) somewhat genetics. \n\nYou can keep your distance without being judgemental about it.", "No you can't because the decision to keep your distance requires you to have judged them. And there is nothing wrong with that, it's literally a parents job to make judgements about the safety of their child. \n\nAnd it's really not possible to just politely avoid someone who is as close as your BIL, trust me I've tried for the last several years. Someone is always going to wind up getting hurt and demanding you explain why you don't attend the same events, or why you don't celebrate his birthday, or why you don't have a relationship with his children etc"]}
