She also decided to see a therapist. \n\n\nAs most of the comments suggested I talk to my brother and parents about SIL's behavior. It have been a week and we are all doing mostly good, my SIL have her first therapy session, she finds it nerve wrecking but believes it'll be effective. She tells me that she would randomly think about my boyfriend's diagnosis and get all anxious and whenever she caught herself getting anxious over this she played Tavern music and draw a medieval town (i don't know the exact term) which seems to work really well to soothe her. She also gets a better sleep and the baby is healthy. \n\n\n\nI have read all the comments in my original post though I disagree with some of the comments about my SIL, I agree that I was at fault for not setting boundaries and lying to her about my relationship. I am truly grateful for all the advices and it was such a great insight and motivation to read about people who are in a similar situation as me and my BF\n\n\n\nI also apologize to my BF for disrespecting ourrelationship.  We both agree that we should no longer disclose his diagnosis to anyone, unfortunately we have to change our couple therapist and it's hard finding a new one. Apart from that things are going well and last Friday I formally met his family for the first time, which goes beyond my expectation. \n\n\n\nAgain I would like to say thank you all for your support and advice.", "created_utc": 1675339353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ro818/update_aita_for_refusing_my_brother_and_his/", "score": 113, "replies": ["[Original post for Thirsty Thursday](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jcy8w/aita_for_refusing_my_brother_and_his_pregnant_wife/)", "Did SiL ever discuss *why* she was so invested in your relationship with your bf?
