We said that was fine. Dropped the kids off on Friday and came back on Monday at 9am to grab them. I called periodically throughout the day to check in on them and was never told anything was out of the ordinary.\n\nWell, we got there to pick the kids up at 9am and our two sons were still sleeping, which is not normal (they are super early risers and always have been- even when going to bed late). SIL makes the comment of \"oh, it's probably because of the cough syrup\". I asked what she meant and she tells me that apparently she gave both my son's an entire cap full of cough syrup the night before because they weren't feeling well and started developing a slight cough (my youngest, 6, has asthma and had his inhaler with him). Not only that but this \"entire cap full\" of cough syrup she gave them was Adults Extra Strength Delsym PM. My son's are 6 and 11. I absolutely lost my shit. I told my husband to get the kids packed up immediately and went off on my SIL for intentionally giving my son's a very high dose of adults extra strength cough syrup when she knows for a fact we do NOT use cough syrup (my mother is a doctor and has told me doctors advise against it due to it being a cough suppressor and being unable to push out the phlegm- which can lead to pneumonia). Not only that but she didn't even tell me prior to giving it. So I said she would never ever see my kids again and we left. She was crying when we took off. \n\nI'm being told by multiple people that I overreacted because my boys are fine. I fail to see how that makes this better. AITA?\n\nETA: it's been made clear multiple times in the past that we don't give our kids cough syrup. She has argued with us about it several times because she gives her kid every medication known to man and we don't. She knew what she was doing and she knew we wouldn't be okay with it. She made comments of \"they are perfectly fine, I told you it was safe\" bullshit when I was flipping out on her. Zero remorse. And since a certain commenter seems to think it's no big deal, I do want to clear up a bit of confusion here on dosage.. an entire cap full of this adult strength delysum is 30mls. My 6yos dose of CHILDRENS Tylenol is only 7.5, per his weight class. That means she gave a dosage 4x too high, in an adults strength medication.", "created_utc": 1685456007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vrgjn/aita_for_telling_sil_she_will_never_see_my_kids/", "score": 6495, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s one thing to give a kid\u2019s dose to a kid - it\u2019s something else entirely to give 2-3x the adult dose to a kid, especially when the kid has asthma and ALL cough syrup labels provide a warning to check with a doctor before use if you have asthma. \n\nI think NTA.

That\u2019s so risky.\n\nI\u2019d advise a trip to your doctor for the kids to get checked out to make sure there are no lingering effects (if the formulation she used contains paracetamol/acetaminophen overdoses are incredibly dangerous for the liver and would not be immediately apparent).\n\nETA: also, a medical professional can check ToxBase or the equivalent poisons center for your country/region.

AND she still went over the recommended limit, which would likely have said to take between 10-20 ML. So, in other words, SIL *drugged your children.*\n\nSIL is only lucky nothing bad happened to the kids, but it just goes to show that she cannot be trusted with your boys.

That is a scarily high dose of a depressant, and I'd be concerned about how it could affect their breathing.\n\nI bring this up because my father did a similar thing to me when I was about 6 or 7, with his reasoning being, \"the more medicine you take, the faster you'll get better.\" When my mom picked me up I could barely stay awake and when I got back to her house, I went back to sleep. She called a doctor who told her to take me to the ER. It was there that they told her that it was only luck that I survived through the night and didn't stop breathing.\n\nPLEASE make sure that there are no side effects with a medical provider. Your SIL poisoned your children. Their health needs to come first right now", "NTA at all. You have a right to be mad and you are completely within your rights to lose it. I had a similar thing happen with Benadryl and a trusted friend.\n\nThat said, other than this you are a close family?  How likely is it that you will never have her see them again?   Reddit loves to tell people to cut off all contact and what she did was egregious, but in most families that's not going to be the reality.\n\nIf you imagine there will be a future relationship then I strongly recommend you take control and set boundaries.. When things calm down and if you think you will see her again or want the cousins to have a relationship, then I would plan out a course of action for talking to her with your husband. Why did she think that was acceptable? Why did she not call you? I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she honestly didn't know about the cough syrup being completely off limits to you, especially since she told you so nonchalantly. It amazes me how much people think other people know about them.  I am not letting her off the hook. However, you don't want her hiding future decisions from you if there's going to come a time when they may be together again so it's better to understand her thought process.\n\nI only say this because that friend that gave one of my son's Benadryl is a wonderful parent and still a great friend. It took a lot to repair our trust, and my kids didn't stay unsupervised with her for a long time, but we did and I'm happier for it.", "NTA.  That cough syrup not only contains dextromethorphan, it\u2019s got a substantial dose of acetaminophen and some tripolidine.  The first ingredient can make people (especially kids) stop breathing if they\u2019re overdosed, not to mention potentially causing seizures.  The acetaminophen\u2019s big risk is liver failure (and honestly, with a dose that big, I think you should contact their pediatrician and ask whether you should be concerned - they may need a blood draw to check their liver function to be on the safe side).  Tripolidine also has risk of seizures with overdose.\n\nIt\u2019s not recommended for kids under 12 at all, with good reason.\n\nAnd if she filled the dosing cup, that\u2019s typically 2-3 times the adult dose.  The dose cups for most brands is much bigger than the amount you\u2019re supposed to take.\n\nThat it appears to have not done harm is lucky.\n\nI think not letting her see them unsupervised is not unreasonable, because giving kids adult medications is really not safe, and that\u2019s something that any reasonable adult should know.  The medication has instructions that say not to give it to kids for a reason.  If she can\u2019t be bothered to check and follow the instructions for medicating them, I wouldn\u2019t feel safe leaving them with her either.\n\nHaving said that, letting her see the kids while an actual responsible adult is supervising won\u2019t put them in harm\u2019s way, so not letting her see them at all is a bit of an overreaction.  When you\u2019ve calmed down, maybe change it to that.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she used the cough syrup as a sedative - knowingly - and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t check in about alleged coughing and how to handle.

If its was an appropriate dose of a child's medicine that MIGHT be forgivable.", "The fact that your kids \"are fine\" does not make her actions in any way acceptable.  She gave them medication that was NOT intended for small bodies because an asthmatic child had a \"slight cough.\"  And, like... was that because she wanted to relieve a cough or because SHE wanted to sleep better?\n\nSaying she'll never see them again *might* be a tad much?

Having argued previously about cough medicine, SIL clearly knew OPs stance about it.  Giving it to them was trying to prove a point and a stupid one at that.  To risk overdosing them for this is absurd and dangerous, especially knowing OPs opinions, AND using adult medicine...it shows, stupiditu, recklessness, and no respect for anyone else.  Big NTA, and cutting off contact is appropriate.  Would I still attend family events that she's at...probably...but she would no longer be alone with my kids.  That would be done. \n\n\n\n\nNTA, with a caveat.  I don't think you overreacted in the slightest.  That was a massive dose for young kids, and the thought that you should let it go because they're fine now, is stupid...it's akin to her saying she drove them around town without their seatbelts but it's okay because they survived...the consequences could have been much greater.  \n\nHowever, I wouldn't personally cut off contact completely...she may not have known your stance, she may have forgotten, sounds like she needs education...does your SIL know you're own mother's stance on cough medicine and therefore your own (while I usually avoid cough syrup for my son for the same reasons, most people I know don't realize it's not beneficial...they hear a cough and move straight to cough syrup), have you talked to her about it before?  It is concerning that having at least a daughter of her own, that she gave adult medicine...she should have known better. \n\nI do think this is a good opportunity to lay down ground rules and boundaries.  She doesn't watch your kids unsupervised again until you're comfortable, and not overnight until she's proven herself with day visits for however long you want.  She doesn't give them anything other than approved foods (if diet restrictions are a factor) without checking with you first.  Anything she does give has to be appropriate for kids (I'd be asking for photos of the bottle to make sure, or provide it myself) and triple checked for right med, right dose, right timing, etc. You can lay down whatever hoops you want for her to earn trust back.  And she's going to have to do A LOT of earning.\n\nHowever, if it comes to light that she really was just trying to get them to sleep, all the above goes out the window.  It's drugging them...no matter how much she may have thought it wasn't a big deal, it is.  That's the crossed line, and no contact is absolutely appropriate.", "So what do you do when they are sick? \n\nWe all know what you don't want done, did you bother to tell SIL what you do want done? \n\nYes, it's frustrating she went against your wishes.

The likelihood of this happening again is not a zero chance \n\nAlso, who is SIL married to? I'm just curious given you base your cough syrup stance on something from your mom. Like, does SIL's partner share your mom? I was just curious. \n\nI see that you are also arguing with anybody who disagrees with you. If you just came to have your bias confirmed, why?  You don't need any of us to firm up your beliefs. Do you need people to argue with? \n\nIf the boys are fine, then they weren't overdosed or poisoned.

Not cool about the cough syrup but telling her she will never see your kids again was a bit over the top IMO.", "[deleted]", "Hm. I think this comes down to her motivations. Obviously her judgment is severely flawed, at best, to not even give you the courtesy of a phone call to check in how you'd like her to handle a symptom like that, not to mention dosing an inappropriate medicine - that's pretty horrifying.

Working with our health authorities, they agreed that it was safer for kids to have no cold meds at all than to be given too much.

Do you not own a fucking phone that takes photos that can be enlarged if you had a problem?\"\n\n* \"Can you not grasp that beside the fact you ignored our EXPLICIT demands that our sons not be given syrup ever that you gave them GODDAMN ADULT DOSES that were 4x stronger than kids are supposed to receive?\"\n\nFinally, personally, I would have added that she is damn lucky I am just yelling at her because what I would really want to do is slap the fuck out of her. No jury would convict you. \n\nWell, don't need any coffee, this entitled SIL bitch has given me the energy to start my day....", "NTA.  She can't be trusted with the safety of children.

Giving your kid melatonin to help them sleep isn\u2019t going to inhibit production later, because they aren\u2019t producing it.

(For a long time the concentration was different on the infant drops and that got really confusing and led to dosing errors, but now Tylenol/Acetaminophen liquid is standard. Go ahead and buy the bigger bottle listed as \"children's\" because it's cheaper, but get the proper dosing from your doctor.)\n\nThe problem is Infant Tylenol and Infant Motrin still have very different doses, so you always want to to keep the right dosing device with the right medicine. And the Motrin dosing is really weird. Tylenol is 2.5 ml, 5 ml, etc- easy to understand, but Infant Motrin is really weird, like .7 ml or something off like that.\n\nSo I highly recommend using a sharpie to write \"MOTRIN\" on the Motrin one and \"TYLENOL\" on the Tylenol one if it isn't marked on it already. I also recommend having a syringe for each medicine for each child, with their current dose marked in sharpie. When you have more than one kid, at different doses, it just makes it more complicated. So I will take one and write \"Lucy, Tylenol, 5ml\" or whatever her dose is, and mark the dose line all the way around the syringe, and do that for each medicine for each kid.\n\nThat way when you have a sick kiddo (or kiddos) in the middle of the night and you're tired and they need meds you can still give the accurate dose to each child and avoid mistakes.

Otherwise, unless I can run them down each day, my kids need it to doze off", "Makes me a horrible person in the mornings, on top of my already present anger issues.", "I thank the gods for trazadone, and I'm sorry it makes you hung over. I have never been a \"good sleeper,\" probably because I have ADHD and I'm 50, so I was just a pain in the ass. The traz doesn't knock me out, it just literally makes my brain slow down enough to get to sleep. It's been a life saver for me.", "Yupp.. my mom ran a home daycare and she completely understood how tough parenting can be, but, thats just it, as soon as you decide to get pregnant and keep the baby you signed up for another bout of \u201cin sickness and in health\u201d\u2026 yes the blow to wages, trying to find someone to cover your shift or finding other care is difficult and i feel for those parents; its the ones who try to work the system into their favour (dosing kids to hide illness/injury to try and blame the caretakers) are the ones that truly disgust me", "This! People think \"overdose\" is when you show simptoms. No! OD is when you take the dose.", ">You will also generally not be eligible for a transplant if your liver fails due to overdose.\n\nIs this the case if the overdose was the result of being poisoned rather than a deliberate self-inflicted OD? These are children that trusted an adult, not people with suicidal tendencies.", "975 in a single dose is too much for a 6 year old.  Also I don't assume that the idiot who gave it in the first place can be trusted to tell the truth or measure competently", "Not 640 mg. They were given 30 ml and it's 650mg/20ml. That's 975mg. Like that's an adult dose. I hope u/Fit-Assignment-6760 takes her kids to the doctor. \n\n> If it's this stuff: https://delsym.com/products/delsym%C2%AE-nighttime-cough\n>\n> Then it's got 650mg of acetaminophen per 20ml. That's WAY too much for a child. Take those babies to a doctor.", "I feel you there. I have to literally wear myself out completely before I can fall asleep. And if the weather is crappy out that isn't happening. So winters my insomnia, which I have dealt with on and off since I was 14, gets horrible. I have tried multiple brands of melatonin but it doesn't do shit for me. So I used to smoke weed, quit doing that as it was giving me anxiety which compounded my insomnia. So now I just exercise heavily before bed or throughout the day.", "I'm kind of doing that because my prescription is 6 mg but I only take one 3 mgs.\n\nOh and NTA, absolutely!", "Trazodone did (does) me so good too. Was afraid I was going to fall into a habit of misusing my anxiety medication (a benzo) to help me sleep, and my doc dragged me into a headlock to tell me he refused to let me get addicted to it, then he gave me trazodone.\n\n...I mean that's not 100% accurate but...\n\nI literally do not recall the last time I had such good sleep before this. Easy to get there for once in my life, easy to stay there finally against the recent years of crap, it's deep and restful. Wake up feeling great from being so well-rested. It's a beautiful thing.", "Trazadone is the only thing that's gotten me to sleep through the night in a while. I have a low dose, which doesn't make me sleepy but does make it so that when I wake up, I'm able to fall back asleep quickly. It's wonderful.", "Well since we're not talking about an intentional overdose situation then yes it's extremely unlikely to overdose from one instance.", "yeah the gummies do the opposite for me because i suffer from anxiety and my body senses the change and makes me freak out", "It matters because the binders used can affect how the active ingredients are absorbed.", "My kids\u2019 dentist recommended we do dissolvable under the tongue, as gummies are 1. Not great for teeth, and 2. Not absorbed as well. We use superior source.", "That\u2019s a great insight. I also have bipolar and major sleep issues. Loved melatonin for a while then I started waking up at like 3 am and it was hard to get back to sleep.", "Yep, I came to the same conclusion about melatonin tablets...Natrol is highly consistent and reliable, which matters for this supplement.", "I find it so fascinating how sleep aids affect different folks. Ambien didn't even make me drowsy. Zopiclone full dosage? Not even a slow blink. Off-label trazodone is my saviour.", "Yeah I used to wake up multiple times in the night unable to go back to sleep. Sometimes only for 15 minutes but other times for hours. I used to take NyQuil for years and it eventually stopped working so my doctor had me try trazodone. Can\u2019t believe how well it works and I would have done it sooner had I known. Now when I wake up I\u2019m back to sleep within seconds, only awake long enough to roll over. It\u2019s nice to get out of bed in the morning feeling like I actually got a good night of sleep!", "Huh, wild. Round here melatonin is a prescription medication and is thus quite well regulated!", "That's wild! I'm Nordic European, and here drugs are more regulated I guess. Melatonin up to 1,9 mg is sold over the counter, 3 mg and up is prescribed, mostly for the lower cost per gram if you need more than the OTC max dose.", "Senator Orrin hatch (UT) what's the one who made it so that the FDA could not regulate supplements until a problem showed up. He did this for the financial benefit of the supplement manufacturers. A good percentage of all the supplement manufacturers in the United States are in Orrin hatches home state of utah."]}
