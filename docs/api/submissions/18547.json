We said that was fine. Dropped the kids off on Friday and came back on Monday at 9am to grab them. I called periodically throughout the day to check in on them and was never told anything was out of the ordinary.\n\nWell, we got there to pick the kids up at 9am and our two sons were still sleeping, which is not normal (they are super early risers and always have been- even when going to bed late). SIL makes the comment of \"oh, it's probably because of the cough syrup\". I asked what she meant and she tells me that apparently she gave both my son's an entire cap full of cough syrup the night before because they weren't feeling well and started developing a slight cough (my youngest, 6, has asthma and had his inhaler with him). Not only that but this \"entire cap full\" of cough syrup she gave them was Adults Extra Strength Delsym PM. My son's are 6 and 11. I absolutely lost my shit. I told my husband to get the kids packed up immediately and went off on my SIL for intentionally giving my son's a very high dose of adults extra strength cough syrup when she knows for a fact we do NOT use cough syrup (my mother is a doctor and has told me doctors advise against it due to it being a cough suppressor and being unable to push out the phlegm- which can lead to pneumonia). Not only that but she didn't even tell me prior to giving it. So I said she would never ever see my kids again and we left. She was crying when we took off. \n\nI'm being told by multiple people that I overreacted because my boys are fine. I fail to see how that makes this better. AITA?\n\nETA: it's been made clear multiple times in the past that we don't give our kids cough syrup. She has argued with us about it several times because she gives her kid every medication known to man and we don't. She knew what she was doing and she knew we wouldn't be okay with it. She made comments of \"they are perfectly fine, I told you it was safe\" bullshit when I was flipping out on her. Zero remorse. And since a certain commenter seems to think it's no big deal, I do want to clear up a bit of confusion here on dosage.. an entire cap full of this adult strength delysum is 30mls. My 6yos dose of CHILDRENS Tylenol is only 7.5, per his weight class. That means she gave a dosage 4x too high, in an adults strength medication.", "created_utc": 1685456007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vrgjn/aita_for_telling_sil_she_will_never_see_my_kids/", "score": 781, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She called a doctor who told her to take me to the ER. It was there that they told her that it was only luck that I survived through the night and didn't stop breathing.\n\nPLEASE make sure that there are no side effects with a medical provider.

Reddit loves to tell people to cut off all contact and what she did was egregious, but in most families that's not going to be the reality.\n\nIf you imagine there will be a future relationship then I strongly recommend you take control and set boundaries.. When things calm down and if you think you will see her again or want the cousins to have a relationship, then I would plan out a course of action for talking to her with your husband. Why did she think that was acceptable? Why did she not call you? I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she honestly didn't know about the cough syrup being completely off limits to you, especially since she told you so nonchalantly. It amazes me how much people think other people know about them.  I am not letting her off the hook. However, you don't want her hiding future decisions from you if there's going to come a time when they may be together again so it's better to understand her thought process.\n\nI only say this because that friend that gave one of my son's Benadryl is a wonderful parent and still a great friend. It took a lot to repair our trust, and my kids didn't stay unsupervised with her for a long time, but we did and I'm happier for it.", "NTA.  That cough syrup not only contains dextromethorphan, it\u2019s got a substantial dose of acetaminophen and some tripolidine.  The first ingredient can make people (especially kids) stop breathing if they\u2019re overdosed, not to mention potentially causing seizures.  The acetaminophen\u2019s big risk is liver failure (and honestly, with a dose that big, I think you should contact their pediatrician and ask whether you should be concerned - they may need a blood draw to check their liver function to be on the safe side).  Tripolidine also has risk of seizures with overdose.\n\nIt\u2019s not recommended for kids under 12 at all, with good reason.\n\nAnd if she filled the dosing cup, that\u2019s typically 2-3 times the adult dose.  The dose cups for most brands is much bigger than the amount you\u2019re supposed to take.\n\nThat it appears to have not done harm is lucky.\n\nI think not letting her see them unsupervised is not unreasonable, because giving kids adult medications is really not safe, and that\u2019s something that any reasonable adult should know.  The medication has instructions that say not to give it to kids for a reason.  If she can\u2019t be bothered to check and follow the instructions for medicating them, I wouldn\u2019t feel safe leaving them with her either.\n\nHaving said that, letting her see the kids while an actual responsible adult is supervising won\u2019t put them in harm\u2019s way, so not letting her see them at all is a bit of an overreaction.  When you\u2019ve calmed down, maybe change it to that.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like she used the cough syrup as a sedative - knowingly - and that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t check in about alleged coughing and how to handle.

I'm talking about something the OP said that is an extremely common mistake people make with regards to children's medications and frequently leads to serious harm. Understanding the difference between volume and concentration when it comes to medication dosing is extremely important. \n\nJust a heads up, you can't compare mls like that. Don't get me wrong, I totally agree that your SIL was way out of line, but different meds have different concentrations, so you have to look at how mgs of a given med are in each ml to figure out the actual amount of a med given. Infant, children's and adult medications can often have three different concentrations, so it's important to recognize how to calculate this.\n\nEdit: She still overdosed your kid, but probably not 4x as much, if she gave the normal dosage of the Delsym.", "Edit: I saw the edit on OPs post.  Having argued previously about cough medicine, SIL clearly knew OPs stance about it.  Giving it to them was trying to prove a point and a stupid one at that.  To risk overdosing them for this is absurd and dangerous, especially knowing OPs opinions, AND using adult medicine...it shows, stupiditu, recklessness, and no respect for anyone else.  Big NTA, and cutting off contact is appropriate.  Would I still attend family events that she's at...probably...but she would no longer be alone with my kids.  That would be done. \n\n\n\n\nNTA, with a caveat.  I don't think you overreacted in the slightest.  That was a massive dose for young kids, and the thought that you should let it go because they're fine now, is stupid...it's akin to her saying she drove them around town without their seatbelts but it's okay because they survived...the consequences could have been much greater.  \n\nHowever, I wouldn't personally cut off contact completely...she may not have known your stance, she may have forgotten, sounds like she needs education...does your SIL know you're own mother's stance on cough medicine and therefore your own (while I usually avoid cough syrup for my son for the same reasons, most people I know don't realize it's not beneficial...they hear a cough and move straight to cough syrup), have you talked to her about it before?  It is concerning that having at least a daughter of her own, that she gave adult medicine...she should have known better. \n\nI do think this is a good opportunity to lay down ground rules and boundaries.  She doesn't watch your kids unsupervised again until you're comfortable, and not overnight until she's proven herself with day visits for however long you want.  She doesn't give them anything other than approved foods (if diet restrictions are a factor) without checking with you first.  Anything she does give has to be appropriate for kids (I'd be asking for photos of the bottle to make sure, or provide it myself) and triple checked for right med, right dose, right timing, etc. You can lay down whatever hoops you want for her to earn trust back.  And she's going to have to do A LOT of earning.\n\nHowever, if it comes to light that she really was just trying to get them to sleep, all the above goes out the window.  It's drugging them...no matter how much she may have thought it wasn't a big deal, it is.  That's the crossed line, and no contact is absolutely appropriate.", "So what do you do when they are sick? \n\nWe all know what you don't want done, did you bother to tell SIL what you do want done? \n\nYes, it's frustrating she went against your wishes. I think it's unreasonable to not further communicate with the people taking care of your kids how to help soothe them, and there is no mention of that here. \n\nI mean, does the 11 year old have sleep overs? The likelihood of this happening again is not a zero chance \n\nAlso, who is SIL married to? I'm just curious given you base your cough syrup stance on something from your mom. Like, does SIL's partner share your mom? I was just curious. \n\nI see that you are also arguing with anybody who disagrees with you. If you just came to have your bias confirmed, why?  You don't need any of us to firm up your beliefs. Do you need people to argue with? \n\nIf the boys are fine, then they weren't overdosed or poisoned.

I'll stand by defending OP in this, my exM&FIL both pulled this same stunt with my son, and my ex had an abuse problem with cough syrup so this really strikes a nerve with me and I'm sorry.\n\n\nI would like to add, it's not like SIL would be unfamiliar with the fact children don't get full doses, she's a mother too with at least 1 daughter, unless she's been overdosing her own kid in which case I don't think who TA is is a question anymore, but that is speculative entirely.", "Mistake in dosage is worthless when that medicine isn\u2019t even rated for kids under 12 anyway.

Once, if acetaminophen, isn't going to cause liver damage... thankfully!", "Not when taken below the recommended dosage a single time. Please find me a case of someone dieing or getting liver damage from acetaminophen/paracetamol from a single instance at below recommended dosage.

If i would eber make the terrible choice to have unwilling children, i would also not give them cough syrup.

But you can, by doing things repeatedly, cause liver damage that'll go past the point of no return - alcoholics for instance, tend to have this problem. \n\nIt's why liver transplants are so cool. You can take a portion of a healthy liver and treat it right, and you can eventually have a normal sized, fully functioning liver barring any organ rejection.", "This isn\u2019t true. Acetaminophen can absolutely cause liver damage in one day. Over time at suggested doses, there should be no problems. But a one time overdose can cause acute liver failure (over 4000mg/day).
