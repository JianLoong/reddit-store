I\u2019ve seen in before. But in the last few years she has had a series of bad relationships that have beaten her down. \n\nYou knew she just went through a breakup and she trauma dumps when thar happens.  You reached out to her after a breakup and now you're upset with her for trauma dumping. \n\n>Not sure what kind of healthy relationships you have since a lot of your comments are pretty derisive and show a lack of understanding of emotional and mental health struggles, but I don\u2019t live my life by those standards. And besides this situation with B, I can say that my circle is incredibly supportive and caring of one another. Take care of yourself\n\nThe kind where I don't outline exactly how someone takes advantage and then let them take advantage.  You think that's some great sign of mental health and I strongly disagree that being a sucker is. \n\nYou say she doesn't offer the same support that she expects from others but you think this I'd a healthy friendship?  Letting yourself be taken advantage of?  LOL.", "NTA. B rescinded the offer when she moved back in with her ex. She wasn't going to live in 2 places. Don't put your cat's health in danger. If B finds another guy, she may not stay at your place. Or she and her new guy will be there. Use your good pet sitter and move on. Let everyone you can know B IS NOT house sitting or temporarily living with you. Change locks if that could be an issue. Leave a notarized document for your house sitter stating no one is living at your address except you and your BF. That way if B does get in there, the sitter can call the police and report a break in. If B plants herself in your apartment for the month you are gone, you might have to evict her.", "NTA she sounds exhausting. I don't know why bother with her. Just drop her as a friend", "NTA\n\nShe sounds like she has has just as many red flags as her partners.", "NTA\n\nRescind the offer ASAP. \n\nYou would never get rid of her. Your life would be turned upside down.", "Hell, OP needs to get her out of her house AND her life", "Luckily our building is very secure with a very complicated fob and access system. We have never granted her access to our fobs and they cannot be duplicated (we tried in order to have an extra fob for our sitter/guests). Our trip isn\u2019t until later this year so she hasn\u2019t even seen the inside of our building much less our actual home.\n\nBut I will make a note to leave that document with the sitter in the event that B spirals and somehow breaks into our home and police need to be called.", "I'm sorry to say it, but you don't have a friendship. You have a leech.", "Will do and sending virtual (hypoallergenic!) pet snuggles \ud83d\udc95"]}
