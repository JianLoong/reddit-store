I'm pregnant with my second (heavily so) and a lot slower than normal, so being organized is more important than ever.\n\nMy husband invited a coworker and his wife over today. While he and the coworker were talking outside, she and I were inside. I had made us tea. She said she was peckish, and I was tired and my ankles hurt, so I told her to help herself to the fridge, but nothing on the second shelf.\n\nShe asked if she could have some hummus. I didn't think we had any left and asked what shelf it was on. She said the second. I said the second shelf was my son's food. She asked me what I meant, and I said it was preprepared meals for him. She asked if I was joking, and I said no. She ended up going back outside to talk to our husbands.\n\nWhen she was leaving and everyone saying goodbye, she made a joke about how next time she will bring her own snacks since we don't share food. Both of our husbands looked confused. I was so embarrassed. I told my husband what happened, and he said she was being rude, not me.

Kudos on the meal prep, I support the idea. Also have an easy and safe birth!", "NTA She was a very rude guest.", "NTA, you're a better person than me. Had she said that to me I would have acted like she wasn't calling me out. \"That would be such a great idea, you're so kind, since I'm heavily pregnant, and I have an autistic child that only eats certain food! You are just so thoughtful!\"", "You: \u201cHelp yourself to anything but this\u201d\n\nThe wife: \u201c But I want the thing I can\u2019t have and I\u2019m going to be rude and passive aggressive\u201d \n\nYou didn\u2019t deny her food, just a specific thing. \n\nNTA.", "NTA, but you have a mouth. You could have said, feel free to choose anything, but the 2nd shelf has been prepared for our son according to a certain protocol, as he is autistic.", "NTA,\n\nNope not at all, don\u2019t even feel bad. You have no reason to be.", "NTA she was being really rude. As a guest I would never ask for food unless offered.", "NTA. You even stated she could help herself to anything except whatever was on the second shelf. She was rude and if it were me, she wouldn't be invited back.", "NTA. I despise people who think it\u2019s cute to stomp on boundaries. Especially when it comes to food. The title is kind of misleading. You definitely were not denying her food. You were being a good host by offering her food just not the food you had specifically prepared and set aside. You didn\u2019t owe her an explanation as to why she could not have that particular snack. She was so rude for being passive aggressive like that in front of everyone. Please don\u2019t feel bad OP, she hella sucks for doing that.", "She was definitely being rude. NTA", "NTA for not sharing your son's prepped food, but I do think that if you invite someone over to visit that you should be prepared and offer drinks and snacks.", "NTA. You told her she could have anything not on the second shelf and she did exactly that. If I\u2019m going to someone\u2019s house and going to get hungry, I\u2019ll bring something.", "NTA.  If I read correctly you did offer food (though going to someone else\u2019s house and announcing that you are hungry if really rude IMO), just not certain foods.", "NTA. She on the other hand is rude and entitled.", "Nta. She could've picked another shelf...how rude to drop in on a pregnant couple and to then expect refreshments?!?! Lmao", "NTA. You\u2019re pregnant and don\u2019t need extra work and she\u2019s just rude", "NTA. It is expected to be offered tea/coffee/water/soda, most people don't offer food. If she was hungry, she should pack her own snacks just in case (I have to because diabetic, but it's a good habit for anyone to get into because you don't know when you feel hungry and are unable to get a snack) or just wait until later. She was really rude.", "NTA at all\n\nI LOVE to share, especially food. But my son and I have food allergies and I don't share specific things because they are expensive and just for him/us. Things I know he likes and will eat. My son comes before other people. \nOther people can suck it. They have money in a car, they can go get themselves a snack.", "NTA \nAbsolutely NTA. Who demands food then when offered everything but one type demands that one type? \n\nI have no idea why she tested your boundaries like this but when people do that - push boundaries for no sensible reason - I always get the ick. It just serves as a warning to distance myself from them in future.", "NTA. At all.", "Nope, OP NTA. Guest was being a rude-ass guest. Next time go to their house and just help yourself to whatever they have. Don\u2019t ask. She how she reacts.", "NTA\nYou told her anything but stuff on the second shelf. That is not hard to understand. She didn't need to eat your son's hummus. She was a jerk and maybe she doesn't need to come for a second visit.", "NTA at all. She was rude.", "NTA - I thought that you always bring food when visiting someone pregnant or with a new baby. Though unless invited for dinner, expecting food is rude.", "NTA you told her nothing on the second shelf", "NTA that lady reeeally sucks tbh put yourself in her shoes you go in their fridge as a guest in their home and they tell you pick something else, how do you not just let that go. I could understand if that\u2019s your bestie Youre gonna give them shit but that\u2019s not even your friend that\u2019s your husband\u2019s friend\u2019s wife and to be making slick comments like that is so disrespectful imo regardless of the reason of the original refusal.", "No she is beyond rude your house your food your routines far out who does she think she is", "NTA\n\nI write the following out of frustration with entitled adults, not as a serious suggestion or to reflect on you in any way. \n\nNext time she comes over let her eat something off his shelf(preferably from an opened package). Then, after, ask if she enjoyed it and then express your relief and how you usually don't let others eat his food because he sensory seeks by licking all of it or wiping his boogers on it whenever he has an opportunity, packaging and all. Express your gratitude that she's so welcoming and accepting of his behavior. Do it as sweetly and earnestly as possible, with a straight face.\n\nYeah... I'm pretty petty and think some people need to learn the hard way that in someone else's home you should mind your own damned business.", "NTA.

It\u2019s freaking hummus", "NAH except for your husband who invited guests over and didn't bother to prepare anything for his guests.

She was rude", "NTA, she was very rude.", "NTA she was just rude", "NTA. When you're at someone else's place you're not entitled to food or drinks.

If she's \" peckish\" she needs to keep snacks with her.", "they were husbands guests, he invited them over, why didn't she ask him  fix them some food instead of putting the workload on a heavily pregnant woman", "Maybe because I expect the worst of people but I believe she wanted something from the second shelf because she was told she couldn\u2019t take anything from there.", "WtH she was rude. This is triggering. I did have a lot of \u201cspecial food\u201d not even my wife touched when I was sick / recovering / getting a work up. No one messed with them.\n\nAt a friend\u2019s place his now wife was also on a diet (recovered from some stomach thing), and of course couldn\u2019t share her food.

I think not providing drinks and snacks for invited guests is also rude.", ">wait to be offered.\n\nIt probably varies depending culture, but my older relatives absolutely expected to be offered food and drink when they were visiting, and considered themselves obligated to offer food and drink to all guests. Not necessarily a meal, but something.\n\nBut *under no circumstances* would a guest *ask* for food.

Some people literally think the world revolves around them.", "Then she could\u2019ve taken her ass home if she felt that unwelcome.

As a special needs parents or a parent in general you NEVER have to explain your child\u2019s \u201ccondition\u201d to anyone! No is a full sentence and if she couldn\u2019t pick something out of anything else she had in the fridge that\u2019s her problem!
