I didn't think we had any left and asked what shelf it was on. She said the second. I said the second shelf was my son's food. She asked me what I meant, and I said it was preprepared meals for him. She asked if I was joking, and I said no. She ended up going back outside to talk to our husbands.\n\nWhen she was leaving and everyone saying goodbye, she made a joke about how next time she will bring her own snacks since we don't share food.
