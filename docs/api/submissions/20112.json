Dropping the kids off at school is a straight forward task. \n\nThe best example i can think of for a difference in mental load is cooking a meal vs planning meals for a weakly shopping trip. Cooking a meal is straightforward: acquire ingredients, prepare ingredients, cook ingredients. You may be coordinating timing, but it's straightforward.

Therefore that avenue will never yield the results you're looking for.\n\nSo ask yourself this, Mr. Math Brain sir: what percentage of the time are you actively trying to see things from her perspective, vs. actively trying to force your perspective onto her as the \"more factually correct\" one?", "I think it's more of a question of the mental weight of tasks, and I'm sure it varies from people to people how much it \"weighs\" to them. However, I'll take in your example. Driving the kids to school takes time but it's not a \"heavy\" task mentally, it's more akin to a routine. Where remembering to set up appointments, manage the schedule and remember the appointments, remember your kids' last vaccine and whatnot, requires a bit more brain power even if it technically takes less time.\n\nIf you wife has all the tasks that require planning and organizing, it can feel very overwhelming. A good example is kitchen duties. Even if cooking every day takes times, if your partner does all the grocery checks, the list, the meal plan, etc. It might take less time in a week than let's say grocery shopping and cooking, but the planning aspect takes more of your brain juices.\n\nIf your wife is consistently the parent that has to make the decision and plan things ahead, it can grow very very tiring and stressful. Or the \"where is this? where is that? what should I do with this? when is our kid's soccer game?\" wife to you, it can create an extremely heavy mental load.\n\nI think doing a simple spreadsheet is a bit AHish because it removed the human aspect from it all, and the fact that you're supposed to be a team. Time is not a great indicator of task management because not all tasks are equal to our brain.\n\nSo I'd look at each of your tasks, with your wife, and define what are \"heavy\" tasks for you brains. Your opinion might differ, we're not all the same. But you'll have to be understanding and fair, as she might say that she wishes to exchange some tasks with you to lighten her mental load, or your might decide to share some heavy tasks like meal planning because two brains are better than one.\n\nYou're a team, so use each of your strengths and share each other's burdens.\n\nI'll still say NAH because I think you can resolve the situation without either of you being the \"mean guy\". You need to understand each other's issues, rather than trying to be rigt.\n\nEdit : Spelling.", "Hm. I think YTA.

As it has been mentioned various times now, writing a grocery list might take 30 minutes and taking the kids to soccer takes 30. But writing a grocery list involves planning, considering everyones wants, what is in the house already\u2026 between putting a grocery list together and taking someone somewhere by car, I\u2019d pick the car ride any day of the week. I hate writing the list but love going shopping. My partner doesn\u2019t mind thinking about what to make but hates grocery stores. I\u2019d much rather spend 2h in a grocery store staring at the colourful produce than 30 minutes on a list. \n\nEven if the hours are fair, we all have chores we like more and less and maybe it is time to evaluate whether OPs wife feels stuck with chores that require more mental strain (planning and organizing vs mindlessly sitting in the car going somewhere) or with chores she dislikes doing. Instead of making a spreadsheet insisting on the hours, he could simply stop being defensive for one second to hear out her point and then discuss a solution with her. We don\u2019t even know if his wife is being unreasonable because he has never tried to hear her out and truly ask her what makes her feel that way, what stresses her out and if they need to redistribute their current chores between one another.", "That's not how you _should_ communicate in a relationship \n\nIt's not a yes/no thing. Its should be:\n\n\"you don't do enough around the house\" \n\n\"I feel like we do similar amounts, is there something in particular that I am not doing or that feels overwhelming to you?\"\n\nIt's not about the hours. It's about being there for your partner and acting like a team instead of acting like five year olds in a fight\n\n\"Winning\" means noting if your husband/wife is miserable and ends up divorcing you", "How can you rarely fight but also have this same fight a hundred times?", "Why did you come here? This sub only assigns who are assholes or not, if you are sure neither of you are then this sub is not the place for you.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Yeah, but you still came here for something.\n\nI think you were hoping for a lot of NTA and agreement, and you weren't met with that.", "It was pointless to come here. This subreddit ***really*** hates men for some weird reason.", "After reading some of your answers, sounds like she is as tired as you are but different reasons. Like you say here, she does things that you don't even think about. That sounds like the mental load, that women so often handle alone in a straight relationship without the help of a man. \n\nIt's not just who takes the kid to a doctor and making father's day cards, it's the planning before that, that is taxing, because you can't get away from it. For example making a grocery list, it's not just thinking what you want to eat, it's also dietary restrictions, what do you still have on the fridge, what is going bad and needs to be eaten soon, what's on sale, what are you gonna eat tomorrow, day after or week from now, how can you repurpose leftovers and so on. And not only planning, it's also about managing the whole household, giving tasks to everyone and making sure, those tasks are being done. It's lonely and taxing to be the only one responsible of the things being done. \n\nI am not saying that you don't do enough, if you are not lying, you do about the same amount of chores, but it does seem like you don't understand what she does and why it's stressing her out that much. And vice versa, since it seems like even if you get mentally easier tasks, you might end up spending more time doing these tasks.\n\nI also want to add, that mental work is something she might do throughout the day. Opens cupboard and sees there are only one egg left, makes a mental note to buy more. Shoes seem a little tight on a kid, mental note to buy new ones when sale comes. \n\nSo while you don't have enough free time for yourself and you feel tired, she is too, since she is not \"off\" from that work ever either. You say you want respect from her and while that is a decent requirement in a relationship, seems like you don't value her for all she does either.", "He's really insistent on getting credit for that time spent sitting in a car with his kids, too!", "I do the laundry when I get home from driving the kids.", "But what should he do to counter her \"I feel\"s? He says he wondered if he was doing too little, and worked it out. He didn't just do this first, to make her feel bad. I wonder did she get a chance to go over the list and make comments? It should at least be a discussion starter. If he'd just said \"I feel I do as much\", well, that isn't very useful without some data on the subject. I realise he could be underestimating times for things he isn't doing, so - discuss!", "Yeah but his wife tells him that she does Soo much more then him all the time, he got sick of it and of trying to talk to her so her so he brought facts and logic because he had nothing else to do\nThat's how I see it at least, (op if that's the case then NTA)", "This is an excellent practical solution.", "I guarantee I\u2019m not considering MY. MY. MY mental load in the calculation.  Every comment I\u2019ve seen presupposes that my wife carries the mental load and not me.  Why is that?  Is the \u201cmental load\u201d lighter for a man than a woman?", "This right here.", "Drug users I've managed in catering definitely overestimated how hard they were working. I didn't care that they took drugs, even though sometimes they were high on the job. I like pot and some hallucinogenics too so I get it. But just don't bullshit people about an honest days work.", "This is exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nI absolutely consider health concerns, work schedules, school schedules, budgetary concerns,  individual personal preferences of her and the kids, differences in learning needs/deficiencies, interests, hobbies, favorite foods, favorite colors, progress in school, school supplies, uniform requirements, grades, special events during and after school, and a million other things I\u2019m required to know as a parent.  I am involved in all the stuff.  \n\nPeople assume I\u2019m just chilling, waiting on my wife to bring me a sandwich, but that\u2019s just not how it is.", "So cooking/cleaning takes the same effort as driving kids around? All calculated as 'hours'", "Just talk to your wife and find a solution. It's not like you have other choices. Get therapy together if you need it", "Haha that's fair but they were just using that as an example.\n\nWithout more info I'm going to go with NAH. I believe she sincerely feels like she does more, and I believe you sincerely feel like your spreadsheet is correct although there are many things that it can't possibly take in to account. \n\nMaybe she's actually feeling more frustrated with the roles you've taken in the division of labour rather than the time being the sole issue. Like I'd much rather do something immediate, like laundry, than make and keep track of Dr's appointments just because of how my brain works.", "His spreadsheet is no more facts and logic than her feelings though. If he'd worked on it with her then maybe, but this is just his list of what he does (likely with all the numbers rounded up) and what he thinks she does.", "This is easy. Swap tasks and then see how it goes. By your calculation she\u2019ll be working harder.", "What else do you do besides being a chauffeur to your kids?", "You\u2019ve only described driving kids places as your load.", "Yes? If ever there\u2019s a task where you need to be 100% on 100% of the time it\u2019s driving. You cannot allow your focus to slip or to relax or drift off while driving.", "Take them to the doctor, sports, dance, theater, go camping, hiking, gardening.  We read, paint, draw.  My youngest daughter loves birds, so we look at bird books and practice bird calls, she draws birds for me.  I\u2019ve taught them how to fish, mow the lawn, do laundry, cook, build a fire, ride a bike, swim without floaties (just this past weekend!)\u2026. \n\nI try my best to be a good dad.", "Take a look at his post history. Two of few most recent seem quite relevant to marriage issues.", "Oh wow. You're either living with mom or your roommates hate you because you never cook or clean.", "You\u2019re spending a LOT of time answering these comments and not enough time in a counselling room with your wife", "Who cleans the toilets?", "Sounds like you get to do all the fun things", "There shouldn't be a conversion rate. There is no conversion rate in good parenting. There shouldn't be maths involved.  Each parent plays to their strengths and then each does other bits regardless.   As others have said to you.
