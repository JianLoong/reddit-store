That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.", "That\u2019s the thing.  I DO help.   And when she pints out something I could improve on or help with (grocery shopping, or coordinating dance practice for instance), I do my best to do better.\n\nI\u2019m not some pig who expects my wife to do everything while I watch tv.  I work hard.  I care about my family and my wife and her feelings.  \n\nThe only reason I sat down and added it up is because I thought I was being unreasonable or not contributing as much as I should.", "My wife is fucking amazing.  She does things I\u2019d never even think about, like watching a movie then having a themed picnic in the front yard, or having the kids make me Father\u2019s Day cards.  She\u2019s wonderful.  I adore her.  I love my wife with every fiber of my being.  \n\nI just want her to recognize that I contribute.\n I do little creative things with the kids too.  I do lots of little acts of kindness too.", "TALK TO HER. \n\nDelete the spreadsheet, and talk your issues out, don't argue about it.", "Then this sounds like a problem where level-headed and open communication comes into play. If you're both trying to run a household where neither of your efforts can equal to 100% without burnout, an agreement needs to be made. \n\nAnd not something as simple as \"Here is a spreadsheet. We do the same. Stop bugging me.\" \n\nOr you both keep breeding resentment toward each other till you find yourself in a laywers office filing for divorce. Those are really the only choices I can see, personally. \n\nFrom experience too. You sound like my ex-husband. 100%", "And only came out 8 hours ahead. Sounds like she must work more hours @ job. That\u2019s not question you were asked.", "Have you guys been stressed lately? It just seems you have kinda snapped a little, made this intensive spreadsheet out of anger, I mean you could sit down and talk to her, you both could have the opportunity to be honest, figure out a new plan where you both feel like you are getting supported?\n\nThis kind of behaviour only breeds resentment towards each other. I think just keep talking, communicate and try to help each other, hopefully you guys still get along and laugh and talk with each other.", "When you make these appointments for the kids, did you remember in your own that the kids were due for a doctor\u2019s appointment or did your wife tell you to make the appointment? Do you look at the school and family calendars to determine which date is best for the appointment or does your wife tell you which date to select? That\u2019s a genuine question. I\u2019m wondering if your wife is frustrated because she might be handling more of the managerial household tasks than you do.", "There is a book and set of cards called \u201cFair Play\u201d that talks all about this.   The time commitment of driving is not equal to the mental load of figuring out logistics of, say, doctors appointments or sports teams.  \n\nThe suggestion is to divvy up the full responsibility of the task to one person.   So, if you are responsible for doctors appointments, you book AND take the kids AND do the follow up meds, etc.    that\u2019s the full load of that job/task.  \n\nLike mowing the lawn might take an hour but takes almost zero mental load. \n\nIt also talks about how men continually overvalue their contributions by doing things like assessing time per task and not assessing the mental load.", "Yeah, but you said you have been married for 7 years, and this has been a point of contention? So why is she saying that you do much less? Why does she think that, have you bothered to really sit down and figure out why she keeps saying that to you? Don't you want to know why she thinks you much less, even though you don't?", "Your wife sound amazing, so do you. You both sounds like you work really hard for the family.\n\nSo you should both be able to sit down and be open to a conversation about how you're both feeling, and how you can both feel appreciated and supported.", "How many kids do you have and what are their ages? Are you both the parents of all the kids or are you a blended family?", "I\u2019m not going to show her the spreadsheet.  I know that\u2019s a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe fact of the matter is literally that I do an equal amount, of chores, appointments, bill paying, etc.  EQUAL.\n\nI\u2019m so tired of being told I do less than or not enough, it\u2019s truly demoralizing, when it demonstrably innacurate.", "I work 50 hours at my job.  She works from home and barely touches 40 hours.", "Fair play is a game changer for so many guys. I love watching men become better husbands and fathers practicing and reading it.", "She is!!!  I\u2019m not trying to one-up her.  I\u2019m sorry I even made this post.  It\u2019s not a contest, I just want her to SEE what I do.", "I have 2 kids from a previous marriage.  I take them to school 2-3 days per week depending on my work schedule, which takes 2 hours per trip.  She takes our daughter to school 4-5 days per week, which takes 30 minutes per trip.\n\nIf you read my other comments, I\u2019m not trying to prove that I do \u201cmore\u201d.  I\u2019m just trying to say I do the same, just in a different way.\n\nWe both work hard as fuck.  We both contribute.  That\u2019s all the recognition I want.", "So talk to her!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nSit down an go in with an open mind and a calm voice and tone, even if she gets a bit heated, at least try to have an honest chat.\n\nI believe you, you contribute equally.\n\nBut all this adding up on spreadsheets, making posts on reddit is time you could be spending TALKING TO HER, have you even actually sat down and told her how you feel about this??????", "Unless your wife is trying to gaslight you or she suffers from a mental illness that causes delusions, she has a reason for making those comments. Why don\u2019t you sit her down and ask her to explain why she says she does more around the house than you do? Forget you even made the spreadsheet and listen to her perspective before forming your own.", "Honestly, you should cross post to r/relationships if you are looking for possible solutions more than a judgment that you can add as additional evidence to your \u2018case\u2019.", "You're incredibly frustrating because you won't acknowledge if you have even bothered to sit down and discuss with your Wife your feelings? \n\nYou just repeat and rinse the same responses.\n\nDelete this post, and go talk with your WIFE. \n\nIf you can't have an adult grown up conversation with her about this then what's the future hold for you guys?\n\nTALK TALK TALK TALK TALK\n\nI'm done!", "In one of your replies you said she does more of the \u201cemotionally oriented things\u201d than you do. If that\u2019s the case, you\u2019re not doing equal work. It\u2019s not just about the tasks. It\u2019s about the weight of each task. If she\u2019s doing all the tasks that require emotional availability while you only have to be physically available to perform your tasks, that\u2019s a huge imbalance of responsibility between the two of you and it should be corrected.", "I\u2019m not trying to make a case.  \n\nMy \u201ccase\u201d is that I do an equal amount.  EQUAL.  Not more than she does.  She is amazing and works her ass off.\n\nI\u2019m saying I do the same.\n\nI\u2019m not some deadbeat.  I\u2019m exhausted too.", "We\u2019ve had the same argument a hundred times.  I\u2019m not trying to say I do more.  She does more emotionally oriented things, and I do more heavy lifting or just \u201cwork\u201d type stuff.  \n\nI mostly just want acknowledgment that we both contribute equally.  How many doctor\u2019s appointments equal 4 trips to dance class?  I don\u2019t know the conversion rate.  I just know she and I do enough to both be tired as shit all the time.\n\nI\u2019m just tired of the \u201cI\u2019m more tired than you because I do xyz\u201d fight.  We both do xyz.  We\u2019re both tired.  Let\u2019s both take a nap.  Fuck.  I\u2019m not your enemy.", "Look, I just saw your earlier post about issues on deed to house. As well as another earlier one relating to psychedelics that may be contributing to issues here. This is not right forum for what you are mentally dealing with right now. Best to your family.", "What have you done with the math? Did you show the spreadsheet to your wife? You can argue all you want but getting a favorable Reddit judgment isn\u2019t going to improve the situation with your wife.", "You\u2019re trying to quantifiably disprove your wife\u2019s emotions. \n\n\nShe feels a certain way, for a reason. A spreadsheet won\u2019t fix that.", "You make it sound like you're fighting for your honor. If she is amazing, you should try listening to her more and less to your ego.", "Okay so you have sat down and tried to discuss with her your feelings, but it always leads to an argument, there is no calm conversation going on then? Is that right?"]}
