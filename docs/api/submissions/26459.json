As a birthday gift to myself, I changed my name. I always hated my name, it was awful and the reason I had only three friends throughout middle and high school.\n\nMy mom and dad always wanted a girl, so when I came after four boys, and my mom knew she wouldn't have any more kids, she gave me a name that was all her favorite girl names combined. Because it's no longer my name I think I can tell you what it was. 'Nuraileighlira' (nor-ay-ee-ley-li-rah), a mix of 'Noura', 'Leila', and 'Lyra', so I went by 'Nura'. Both this and the fact that I'm African-American meant that I was bullied tirelessly at school, and I grew to hate my mom for naming me this way, and my dad for not saying no to the ridiculous name. Despite me asking her since the age of about 8, mom has never let me change my name or introduce myself as anything else because it's 'unique' and 'beautiful' and I should be 'proud' to be different. By the time I was 16 I spent almost every weekend at my grandparents (dad's side), who also thought the name was questionable, just to get away from my mom.\n\nSo my 18th birthday was the last week of August. The past 2 weeks have been changing legal documents to my new name, one I have loved forever and if i wasn't claiming it, would definitely be going to a future child of mine. Yesterday I changed my email and social media to my new name, and my mom noticed. She texted me asking what I was doing, and I told her I was changing my name. I've been going by this name whenever I'm not around my mom for almost 6 years now anyway, so the only adjustment for my friends/grandparents is naming me in front of my parents.\n\nMy mom called me downstairs and blew up on me about how 'disrespectful I am' and how I 'don't understand how awful it was to not get to use those names' on more than one child. I told her I really didn't care, that now I'm an adult I can do what I want with my name and I'm going to change it. She started crying and telling me what an awful child I am, how I'm 'disregarding her feelings' and that she always thought it was a 'wonderful' name. I may be an AH for this next bit. I lost it, screamed at my mom that she's the reason I never had a social life, was depressed with an ED (I'm currently working through this with a therapist) for most of my teen life and was bullied so badly for my entire school career. I went upstairs and went to cool down with a book. \n\nWhen I went to send a text back to my mom (wasn't too sure what the situation was like downstairs yet) I saw that she'd blocked my number.

Your Mom is completely disregarding your feelings and has been since you were 8. She is acting with very little emotional maturity here- in both her words and actions. She\u2019s asking you to take care of her emotionally while failing to do so for you- which is part of her job as a mother. It\u2019s your life, not your mothers, and you have every right to live with a name you feel comfortable with. Telling you that you don\u2019t understand not getting to use those names and basically asking you to personify all the little girls she dreamed of having but never had and that is a completely unfair burden to place on you. I\u2019m so sorry you experience that lack of empathy and respect for your loved experience.", "NTA\n\nIt's your life. You get to control it, not your mother. \n\nThe fact she has tried to play the victim, despite you spending over a decade telling her how much you don't like the name, proves she is a narcissist who cares more about her own feels than her child's.", "NTA. I'm always surprised by parents I've read about on here who seem to not only be living entirely in their own fantasy world where their quirky parenting decisions have zero real life impact on their kids, but who also show outrage when those kids express opinions about those decisions or go back on them to improve their lives. I'm sorry that you're fighting with your mum OP, I hope she comes around once she sees you thriving with your new name.", "NTA. I am gonna be honest and say that Nuraileighlira is a horrible name. Why the fuck would someone name their daughter the sound of an eldritch horror? Your mother sounds, from what I can gather from your post, rather selfish. She gives you a dumb name and you get bullied for it and then when you tell her about it she makes it about herself. I\u2019m so sorry you have had to live with that name. But hey, happy belated birthday!", "Definitely NTA. People seem to have lost sight of the fact that their children's names don't actually belong to them. \n\nIMO, giving your child a \"special, unique\" name based on what it means to you personally is a huge AH move.

Some parents don't realize that their children are independent, autonomous human beings and not property. You owe your mother nothing. Your name, your life, your decision. The fact that she's unbothered by the bullying you suffered through growing up is one of many red flags that suggest she's a narcissist. Congratulations on your new name and I hope it brings a smile to your face every time you hear someone call you", "NTA.

You deserve to be comfortable with one of the most basic things about you. Your mom is reacting, from her point of view. Not stopping to consider how this name she invented has negatively impacted your entire life. You have every right to do what you need to do to make your life better. To take the bullseye off your back. Kids are heartless little jerks. When I named my Littles, I considered each aspect of it.

You could have had each of her favorite names as separate names, and not only would that have given you a moniker that other people had a reasonable chance of being able to spell and pronounce, it would also have given you a choice of several names, any of which you could reasonably use as a call-name.\n\nFrankly, it's your name.

My eldest son asked me a few months ago if he could change his name when he is 18. I smiled and said \"Son, if you do not like your name, just tell me what it is and I'll call you that name.\" No ifs or buts. We need to realise that our children ARE human beings with thoughts and feelings of their own and as parents, we should be encouraging them to be the best person they can be. If the name we gave them causes them nothing but sadness and heartache, then WE should change the name! You will never be TA for wanting to be you, and hell, its just a name. Well done on standing up for yourself and being true to your heart. As for ur mum, kick rocks lady.", "NTA. Just because the name had meaning to your mom doesn't mean you had to feel the same way about it. She knew how much you hated the name your whole life and still insisted you be proud of it because she was upset she didn't have a bunch of girls and merged a bunch of names into a made up word. You are 18 and legally an adult so you do not need to get your mom's permission for anything. If she wants to use all her favorite girl names she can get some cats.", "NTA. Names are complicated. I'll be fair to your mom and say that the bullying you experienced because of your name wasn't her fault, but the bullies'. They have no right to torment you for your name. HOWEVER, the big problem here is that your name wasn't about you, but your mom's own selfishness. Your name was a consolation prize for not having a daughter and that's terrible. Even when you were sad about your name, you were supposed to suck it because she didn't have a daughter. What horrible, horrible thing to do to a child.", "NTA -- Children are entire humans, not billboards for their parent's quirks, fandoms, bucket lists, and other weird vibes of \"ownership\". Your mom did not endure a childhood under that name, you did. You don't exist for her validation, entertainment, or possession. Some parents never mature enough to see that. Those are the ones you most need to establish and enforce boundaries with. She will never be able to respect boundaries on her own, not if it feels like doing so is relinquishing control.   \n\n\nI'm sorry your dealing with it.

It\u2019s not their fault others made fun of you, it\u2019s the bullies fault they can\u2019t appreciate other cultures and ideas. This is where you also were the asshole, because you blamed your parents for something that pretty obviously wasn\u2019t their fault.

As you get older, no one gives a shit about your name and will only complement you on it, if they say anything at all.\nEdit: forgot to explain that your moms reaction was really awful, no reason to have such a harsh reaction. Sadness is totally valid for her, but anger is not.\n2nd edit: I should add that you are the asshole not because you\u2019re changing your name, this is totally valid.
