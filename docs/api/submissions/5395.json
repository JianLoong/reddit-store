Our son is named after my husband's maternal grandpa. As someone who never had a family (foster kid who never found a forever home) I loved that my husband had people he wanted to honor. But my husband's family is a little complicated. His mom passed away when he was 6 and he lived with his grandparents for two years because his father was seriously injured in the accident that took his mother from the family. My husband's two older siblings also lived with the grandparents. They all moved back in when their dad was back on his feet, with a roof over his head. But when his dad met his current wife the older siblings moved back in with their grandparents because they did not want a stepmom and did not want to live with her to give her the chance to claim a parental role. They were both teens at the time. My husband was younger. He was maybe 10. He never cared much for his dad's wife. His main issue with her is she forced hugs and other means of physical affection from him when he said no. His dad begged him to give her a chance to be a mom to him. He said it was a very awkward few years and he grew to become distant from both. They had children together while he was still living with them. One of the children died and that led to a very big fight in the family. My husband's siblings did not show up, either to the funeral or to the house after. My husband went straight from the funeral to his grandparents house. After that my husband's father and his wife separated for a couple of years, she had a child, and they got back together (no divorce officially happened).\n\nMy husband is not close to his dad or his dad's second family at all. He has a casual relationship with his dad but that's about it. About three or four years ago my husband's paternal grandfather died and left almost everything between my husband and his two older siblings. My husband's dad got a tiny sum. But none of the other grandkids got anything. This led to a big fight with my husband's older siblings and his dad and dad's wife. The drama just never ends.\n\nDespite them not being close his dad's wife has taken offence to the fact all his dad's grandkids are named after maternal family members and she was put out that one technically got a middle name honoring their dad, but she was not, especially with our child who she considers her first grandchild since she has never met the other children. My husband told her she's not the grandma and she's not his mother so he would never use her name or a name from her side. Now she and FIL are asking me to do something about it. I asked them to leave me alone and speak to my husband about their issues. They told me they were coming to me because I am part of the family and it's rude to dismiss them like that. I wasn't trying to be rude but this isn't my fight, which my husband agrees with. She told me I need to learn how to speak to family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1671729354, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsrcq2/aita_for_asking_my_ils_to_leave_me_alone_and_take/", "score": 401, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

By attempting to force a relationship and ultimately replacing your husband's mother he pushed him away rather than letting a relationship happen organically. Not to mention the blatant disrespect he's showing for his late wife is sickening. When my father passed away my mother never made me call the man she was engaged to \"dad\". She wanted us to hold on to the memory of my father. It's just respect for the other parent living or deceased.
