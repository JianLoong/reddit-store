I drove him every morning for almost a year until he got laid off from that job (30 minutes there, 15 mins back). After that, he started another job further out in the suburbs and started driving himself (after an initial 2 weeks of me being with him in the car until he got comfortable with the drive). This job starts at 7am. Thankfully, I no longer have to drive him now.\n\nNow, the ONE time I asked him to pick me up, he says he\u2019s too \u201cexhausted\u201d and would rather send an Uber to come get me. I tell him I can pay for my own Uber. I get home and see he\u2019s gaming. So \u201cexhausted\u201d right? If he was in bed and sleeping I could understand, but he clearly just didn\u2019t feel like driving 10 mins one way to pick me up.\n\nIs this fair? Am I the asshole for expecting a little bit of self sacrifice after I did so for him for almost a year?\n\n\nEdit: yes, we did discuss it the night before and he said he could pick me up. But then when I got to my friends house, he texted saying he would rather send an Uber.\n\nEdit 2: he didn\u2019t smoke a J or consume alcohol\n\nEdit 3: the car is manual transmission, which is why I had to drive with him until he was comfortable driving on his own (I had to teach him).

What's the deal with that?", "These y t a are confusing to me. It\u2019s not counting favours or keeping score. If I was regularly doing stuff to help my husband without hesitation and was met with excuses when I needed help, I\u2019d feel disappointed. That kind of thing can breed resentment if one party feels like they\u2019re always giving and the other party never reciprocates. I guess you have to ask yourself is this a one off or a pattern and just the latest example? \n\nThe only iffy thing would be if he was legitimately too tired to drive (as in would be in danger on the road). You know your boyfriend. Is he the type to make excuses to get out of doing something and this is the straw that broke  (in that case N T A)  or is he usually helpful and good to you and this is a one off where you are making mountains out of a molehill (and in that case Y T A)", "Unknown, as there isn\u2019t enough information to make a call.  \n\nDo you have your own transportation?  Were you intoxicated?  Could you have easily taken public transportation or an Uber?  Saying you\u2019re too exhausted to drive seems valid to me.  Falling asleep at the wheel can have serious repercussions.", "Info: what difference does him picking you up or him sending you and Uber make?", "I'm going to say YTA, because he still offered you a way home on him. It wasn't like he completely left you in the dust. But I don't think this is about the ride. \n\nYou want him to \"make a sacrifice,\" which tells me that you feel some underlying resentment and perhaps insecurity in this relationship. What you wanted here has nothing to do with the ride and everything to do with wanting a partner who will drop what they're doing for you. But, not everyone shows up in the same way or gives affection in the ways that we do.\n\nYour BF still sacrificed for you by offering to pay the money, order the Uber, and get you home. It might not be the sacrifice of time and effort that you asked for, but it's certainly a sacrifice of money. It's not like he ignored your call or refused to help at all, and I think acting like that's what happened will get you into some hot water. \n\nHave some frank conversations about the type of effort you're looking to have him put it. It's clear that you're second guessing his affection for you, and I'd be willing to bet that is obvious from areas outside of this exact scenario. Use examples of the things you feel like you've done to show up for him, but keep an open mind that he may not reciprocate in exactly the way you want, but that doesn't mean he's putting in 0 effort or doesn't care. \n\nBottom line - if you feel like you're missing something, you need to first identify it, then articulate it outside of the heat of the moment, and remain open-minded to the possibilities.", "NtA - you did it for a year. He just wanted to play his game.  I can't believe people here have an issue with that.", "It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want to put in the effort. Not a good sign", "YTA - I'm going YTA because he offered an alternative and to pay for it. A lot of people play games as a way to wind down and decompress. My point is you can still be tired, as in not wanting to do anything physical, and still be able to play video games. Sitting and smashing some buttons is entirely different from having to get up, possibly get dressed, and get in a car and be alert and drive. He didn't leave you stranded. He offered the alternative off getting you an uber and paying for it, which would have gotten you the same exact result as him picking you up.", "NTA, he's awake, conscious, and sober, so it's no excuse. If he was gaming, he could say that and come after the match/game.\n\nBut to say he's too exhausted and then find him playing games implies he's selfish and self-absorbed. You sacrificed for him and helped him out when he needed it but he couldn't do the same for you.\n\nI'd seriously be considering the relationship at this point.", "NTA. You asked him ahead of time, he agreed, and then left you hanging. It's more comfortable to drive with a partner than in an Uber, and you have to wait longer for one to show up, so it's not the same thing. If I promised I would pick my husband up and I was feeling tired I'd have some caffeine or something.", "this will probably get buried, but OP i want to let you know that i understand how you feel. i don't agree with the Y T A but i can see how your tone in the post might trigger people's defensiveness.\n\nthis isn't a straight Y T A or N T A. it's personal and cultural. i am part of a family dynamic where everyone has automatically assumed we would do anything and everything to help each other. for instance, just yesterday, i was driving home from work (from 5.30am-3.30pm and my commute is 1-1.5 hours each way) and my sister asked me if i could pick up some food for her. even though i was dead tired and the restaurant was a 15 min detour, i didn't think twice. there were no feelings of resentment or anything; i was more than happy to do that for her because i know how much she wanted that food.\n\ni assume that is the kind of dynamic you were hoping for from your partner, just pure selflessness and care for you. unfortunately, i have learned throughout years of dating that it is a spectrum, and most people fall on the more self-preservation and self-interest side rather than the altruistic side of the spectrum. it might be less stressful in the long run to try to find someone who has similar expressions of care and selfless love as you than to settle and repeatedly experience disappointment. it will only lead to resentment, and the bitterness will eat you alive as the years go by.\n\nyou have the power to enforce your boundaries and walk away whenever you feel like your efforts aren't worth the stress. where that line is is up to you; some people are super tolerant of disrespect, but from your post, it sounds like there is already a mismatch of expectations and values in your relationship. i do not think there is a right or wrong in this situation. i think if you feel like you cannot communicate with your partner or if you sense any kind of avoidance of respect (not necessarily disrespect) from him, you may want to reconsider what kind of person to share your life with. i wish you all the strength and courage to make the best decision for yourself!", "NTA you guys made a deal that he would come pick you up, he should pick you up. I'd feel uncomfortable in an Uber. \nIf he was too tired to drive safely, he could have gotten an Uber to you and taken it back together. (But Ubers are not often used where I live)\n\nAlso it's not about counting favours. Its about your partner not wanting to do for you what you did for him. You can't hold it above his head BUT it's totally okay to feel hurt by this action.", "NTA. Now you know he won't do for you what you would do for him.", "Partially YTA\n\nYou are not the AH for wanting him to come pick you up or for being annoyed he was gaming after saying he was exhausted as an excuse. \n\nYou using something you fully chose to do in the past against him for a very minor situation makes you an AH.", "You\u2019re dating an AH", "NTA, he should have kept his word", "NTA\n\nBut did you plan for him to pick you up, or did you ask him once you were already out? Does he smoke weed or drink at all? I wonder if he had a reason why he didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving. \n\nHe also might just be lazy and selfish, which is especially fucked ip when you drove him early af for a year. I don\u2019t know anyone who would do that honestly", "NTA, offering to send an Uber is literally doing nothing. Everyone knows what Uber is and most people have their own app. The game isn\u2019t going anywhere. He could have spent 20 minutes getting you then back to gaming. He simply didn\u2019t want to get you. All these people saying he was so exhausted that he would have crashed are ridiculous. He works a normal 8 hour job like the rest of us. You don\u2019t have to do anything in life, but getting her is the nice thing to do. Reddit doesn\u2019t like doing the nice thing.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re transactional or keeping score if you\u2019ve observed you\u2019re consistently doing more for your partner or putting in more effort than than they are. Don\u2019t be a doormat. It was a 10 min drive. He\u2019s a selfish AH.", "YTA. Offering to pay for an Uber was an reasonable alternative and is still him doing you a favor.", "NTA. You expect him to do what you\u2019re willing to do for him.", "YTA. Are all nice things you do for your partner transactional for you? The fact you helped him out with driving to work seemed important to you, but I feel irrelevant to what you're actually talking about. He can be exhausted and not have to go to sleep he can be exhausted and gaming, everyone deserves down time. He didn't leave you stranded, he made an incredibly nice offer and solution. \n\nThis honestly isn't something worth spending time being mad about.", "YTA\n\nBeing awake enough to game and being awake enough to drive 20 minutes in the dark are two totally different things. I've fallen asleep gaming with no problem before but if I fall asleep behind the wheel it's a BIG problem. He tried to offer a solution to help you both, you refused.", "NTA. My ex and I would always pick each other up if one of us was out for the night or having a few drinks at a friends house. Its something we really reciprocated well. I felt it served a few purposes. We trusted each other to go out and have fun with friends, her friends and mine both respected our support of each other and that goes a long way. And it feels good to do something for your partner.", "NTA - I noticed your other posts \ud83d\udc40. He sounds like a lazy and entitled dude, I\u2019m not gonna lie.\n\nI think it\u2019s time you started taking a hard look at your relationship dynamics.", "You had to acompany him for 2 weeks on the drive to work.\n\nIs he a nervious or anxious driver?\n\nIs he nervious on new driving situations? Unknown roads?\n\nNTA, but you should maybe check with your SO.", "He\u2019s a major asshole.  You had planned the evening before to have him pick you up the next day. He knew this! And he decides he\u2019s too tired. What a major, major asshole.  \n\nWhen you\u2019re in a relationship, there\u2019s give-and-take, and if one person feels like they\u2019re giving more, and the other one is just taking, there\u2019s a big imbalance. That\u2019s what couples do, you help each other out. You were 10 minutes away from home, this is not a big deal to have him stop his game, get in the car and come get you. 20 minutes tops. It would be done.  If your relationship ever moves forward and you decide to have children, he\u2019ll really know what tired is then\u2026\n\nI\u2019m curious, what was the reason a year ago that you had to ride with him to work until he got used to it? I don\u2019t understand.", "NTA but perhaps he felt anxious about an unfamiliar drive in the dark as others suggested", "YTA\n\nHolding something you voluntarily did over him is an AH move. Just is. I'm not gonna dwell on it, but relationships are rarely, if ever, tit-for-tat relationships. Transactional relationships that keep a scoreboard.... I don't recommend them.\n\nAnd in regards to coming to get you, he offered to send an Uber to get you. He didn't say \"tough shit\" and leave you to figure it out. I get that you're mad because he was at home playing video games when you got there and that you feel like if he can game he can come pick you up, but those are your feelings about it, and that's they are. For whatever reason he didn't want to come get you, but offered to have you brought home. Maybe he was tired, maybe he was lazy, maybe he was drowsy but wanted to wait up to be sure you got home so he gamed to stay awake. There are too many maybes and feelings to determine if he was just being lazy... but even if he was, it's not like he abandoned you. \n\nANECDOTAL JUNK: This isn't a big enough event for you to be this upset. I've called my husband wasted asking for a ride from several places, and more often than not he's sent a car instead... and I got in, I went home, and he knew I got home safe. My guy smokes weed and doesn't drive when he's high, but also he's just a lazy dude and constantly a vague form of sleepy. I know this, so if I will need a ride later that evening I tell him BEFORE I leave the house so he can plan, and if I run late, I let him know long before it's time to come home so he can plan and let me know how I'm getting home. Because planning and communication keep you out of fights... just as a suggestion for the future.", "YTA he was literally sending you an Uber", "YTA,he offered a solution, driving when you\u2019re tired is dangerous, playing games is not", "YTA - you need to let go of your resentment over having to drive him to work for a year.

Is he not pulling his weight in other ways?", "ESH, him a bit more I think\n\nCounting favors is a poor way to run a relationship, and only leads to resentment.

How many hours?", "YTA. He offered to send an Uber. Why wasn't that solution good enough?", "YTA - kinda.\n\nIf he is very exhausted it may not be safe for him to drive.\n\nThat being said if he is just making it up as an excuse, still not really his obligation to pick her up.

It's that you felt he wasnt sacrificing himself enough to perform an act to make you feel loved.\n\nI'm gonna NAH, you guys just have communication problems.", "NAH, verging on Y T A. OP, it sounds like there's more at work here than laziness since he's an anxious driver by your own account. I get feeling disappointed that he backed out of coming to get you but he offered an alternative. If anxiety is a factor it's all the more understandable. You need to accept that driving isn't as simple for him as it is for you. Seek his support in other ways.", "Dude\u2019s lazy and you\u2019re not a priority. You are NTA for expecting your partner to want to help you with stuff like that, even if he was exhausted.", "I feel he should have picked you up.

They\u2019ll notice when you stop doing all the extra things. You\u2019ll feel less resentful for all your effort too, because you\u2019re making less of an effort in general.

Use this step back as a way to assess your overall happiness in the relationship.", "I drive my boyfriend to work 6 days a week which means I get up at 5am to take him.

You don\u2019t need to use a lot of energy to play.", "YTA... for starters you don't do things for a partner and keep tabs so they can get you back.  You do things for them because you want to. So your driving him to work shouldn't even be a consideration about this event.  Secondly, HE OFFERED TO GET YOU AN UBER. It's not like he left you stranded. And third, and probably most importantly IT'S NEVER safe to drive if you feel too tired.  Driving tired is equally as risky as driving drunk. The fact that you're too selfish to see that makes me wonder why he's with you.", ">I get home and see he\u2019s gaming. So \u201cexhausted\u201d right?

You're making this about what you think he owes you.\n\nGaming is a low-intensity activity that doesn't require as much physical and mental attention as driving. Who cares if he's exhausted and gaming? Are you gaslighting yourself into thinking he's lying to you and betraying you over something that he owes you? On the other hand, driving while you're tired can also be stressful or dangerous.\n\nI'm not sure why this is a hill that you want to die on.

There is a difference between being exhausted and being tired. There have have been plenty of times where I\u2019m exhausted mentally and physically, but I\u2019m not tired and ready to go to sleep. Most of those times I would never go out driving because I\u2019m not ready to go to sleep, but it might happen whether I want it to or not.

You had to drive the guy downtown and drive him two weeks to a job in the suburbs until he was comfortable, that is a clear indication you are \"the driver\" out of the two of you. \n\nHowever, I empathize when it comes having someone just solve something with money that didn't necessarily need money for it to be solved. It seems like they'd just rather take the easy way out, when you were probably looking forward to having your SO pick you up, seeing them upon leaving a friend's house and having a nice quiet comfortable ride home. As opposed to a germ filled, random Uber that costs x amount to travel in when gas might have been cheaper.", "First: NTA\n\nSecond: I used to love AITA but god it seems like a lot of people here either haven't been in a serious relationship or have a weird transactional view of things.\n\nThird: if someone says they will pick you up and then they can't do it, they should be appropriately apologetic, etc. My husband and I have been together 6 years, and while he is the primary driver, we both take as many opportunities to drive each other or pick each other up as we can...because we like helping each other and seeing each other sooner! Once in a while if one of us really is exhausted or there's some competing priority we might uber etc. but if so we usually make a fuss because we don't wanna let each other down.\n\nI felt like your post had a resentful tone and so I went back and looked at some of your other posts and I see a lot about finances - you are someone who takes pride in your hard work and who is the main breadwinner in your relationship as well as the owner of your shared home. I think the uber thing is not the thing itself. If you're someone who's extremely financially diligent and your SO who makes a lot less tells you they are tired (but not too tired to play video games) and says they will call you an uber - they are kinda spending your money, right? But I think it's more about making the effort. You want him to make an effort and when a grown human claims tiredness and plays a video game instead, it just seems not very emotionally invested. Now, it might be that you're a jerk in real life and he has complaints too and there's context...but at face value, yeah, if someone said they'd get me and then bailed with an excuse to veg, I would be disappointed a bit. If it reflected a pattern, I'd question the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I drove him every morning for almost a year until he got laid off from that job (30 minutes there, 15 mins back). After that, he started another job further out in the suburbs and started driving himself (after an initial 2 weeks of me being with him in the car until he got comfortable with the drive). This job starts at 7am. Thankfully, I no longer have to drive him now.\n\nNow, the ONE time I asked him to pick me up, he says he\u2019s too \u201cexhausted\u201d and would rather send an Uber to come get me. I tell him I can pay for my own Uber. I get home and see he\u2019s gaming. So \u201cexhausted\u201d right? If he was in bed and sleeping I could understand, but he clearly just didn\u2019t feel like driving 10 mins one way to pick me up.\n\nIs this fair? Am I the asshole for expecting a little bit of self sacrifice after I did so for him for almost a year?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is this the only instance of him being lazy and inconsiderate? Exhausted or not, it wasn\u2019t a big ask, it was a simple thing and that\u2019s what you do for people you care about. This could be forshadowing to a life with him. Look for other red flags you over looked", "If it was he hasn\u2019t really driven in the dark he should have just that he wasn\u2019t confident driving at that time and as he offered let him send an Uber.  \n\nThe irritating part is he committed in advance to do it but again it may have been darker than he expected.", "Is your boyfriend 5 years old? Why does he need you to chaffeur him? What the hell?!\n\nAnd the one time you need a ride hes tired but really just wants to play video games? What a lazy fuck. Get rid of him. \n\nHes the AH. Youre not.", "Maybe he just wanted 20 minutes of extra time without you because you nag him about things like playing video games and teaching him how to drive.

Stfu and take an Uber.", "It\u2019s a NAH only because I\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt and assume he\u2019d fall asleep at the wheel (but I suspect he was prob comfy and didn\u2019t want to move rather than dangerously exhausted). However, you babysat him learning stick for two weeks? That\u2019s a huge time and energy commitment. I\u2019d assume you were also exhausted from doing this over and above your own day to day tasks and obligations. You asked for a favour ahead of time, this wasn\u2019t a last min request you sprung on him. While an UBER is nice, I get why you\u2019re annoyed. \n\nIs this a pattern? Do you give give give and he only takes? If so, that\u2019s a problem. I\u2019d be curious about the division of labour etc at home as well. Are you also doing the majority of chores / cooking? If so, then there is an imbalance and you need to have a serious conversation about it. Because it\u2019s exhausting and resentment builds if the imbalance of labour / give / take remains.", "YTA. Maybe he really was exhausted and just wanted to chill. Yes playing video games is chilling. He wasn't going to leave you stranded. However, what is bad is you using your past experience of driving him to hang over his head. Is he going to have to worry about you using that against him in the future?", "Honestly in the case it don\u2019t really matter what u did for him the past he didn\u2019t leave you stranded he was gonna but you an Uber so what\u2019s the difference in him buying you an Uber and picking you up himself besides just an excuse to be mad and pick a fight. Your the asshole", "So I agree that given how much effort you put in to help them with their own commute, it is pretty bs to balk at going 10 mins out of his way and I can totally understand why you are upset.\n\nHowever I felt like I had to address the gaming thing. Just because he is gaming and not sleeping doesn't mean he isn't exhausted. There are multiple types of exhaustion and everyone deals with them differently. It is very easy to be mentally exhausted from work and dealing with people etc, but still be able to handle a hobby that normally makes you happy. Trying to say that the gaming specifically is proof that he wasn't exhausted is inaccurate imo. \n\nTo be clear though, OP is NTA, the BF absolutely should have taken the extra 10 mins to pick her up and OP has every right to be frustrated given how much effort they put in themselves to help with the bf's commute at early hours even. If I were OP this would make me think hard about how much the bf actually cares. OP cared enough to get up early and teach him how to drive a stick shift, and he cant even do something far less arduous?

If it was an every day thing sure that would get old but it doesn't sound like that's the issue, sounds like after weeks of being helped he didn't feel like helping back.", "He is TAH.  You are NTA.  \n\n\nThis sound more and more like someone who put his own \"exhaustion\" and desire to game over you.  \n\n\nThat's not how healthy relationships work.  Like you said, if he was napping or asleep, that would be different.   OR if he'd done something nice for you to make up for not getting you, like making you some tea or a snack.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut he was gaming.  Dump the selfish and/or lazy AH and get a better partner.", "NTA people get way too caught up in keeping score or whatever, he agreed the day previous to pick you up so flaking and saying he would send an uber instead is dumb. I don't think it's a big enough deal to fight over, but expecting someone to pick you up after 1) they said they would and 2) you drove them around consistently, definitely does not make you an asshole.", "I'm sitting on NAH at the moment.

Either it\u2019s a pattern of not putting in the effort you do or he was actually exhausted. Only for op to decide", "Except he did, in fact, offer to get her home at his expense.  Her issue is that he, personally, didn't drop everything and come get her when summoned.", "I am also thinking a bit how the agreement came up. OP was clearly at a party, enjoying her night. Bf was tired and had been working all week and driving long drives every day. I don't know why he agreed to pick OP the day before, but I do know that at friday night I like to relax and sometimes just stay home and play games or watch a movie. You can be very tired but maybe not ready to just go to sleep...\nSo question is why should OP enjoy her friday night but not bf? He did agree to pick her the day before but why? Maybe he didn't know he would be in that mood, or that he had to get up in the middle of the evening and not get a chance to rest...\n\nThey don't have kids so no reason she shouldn't let him enjoy his friday just like she enjoyed hers...\n\nGetting her an uber was a fair offer...", "Right there with you. She drove him for ages, then babysat his incompetent ass while he learned to drive stick, now he won\u2019t help her out the only time she\u2019s ever asked?

These little slights can build up to become big resentments.", "He\u2019s treating you like his mom\u2026. I mean he\u2019s entitled.", "He\u2019s a lazy jerk who\u2019s rather play a video game than take a half hour out of his life to do something for someone else. Good luck with this one way relationship.", "NTA, he can't even pretend to try to reciprocate? For me, that would be a big strike in planning anything like a wedding, or having children together, or even owning a cat. He's not it", "INFO: I feel as though there is a lot more information that we're not getting in this post. Based on what you have written, I would probably say NAH. You guys did agree to him picking you up the day before so I can see where you're coming from, but being tired is also a valid excuse for not wanting to pick someone up at night.   \n\n\nDoes he have a history of not showing up for you when you need him? Because IMO in a healthy relationship this is very much a non-issue. Stuff happens and sometimes we aren't always able to fully commit to the plans that we make. At the end of the day, he still offered a reasonable alternative, even if it wasn't exactly what you wanted. Also, gaming can be extremely low-effort to do, plus there isn't any risk of dying when gaming while tired lol.", "I\u2019m going to say NTA but I have a couple notes.\n1. I don\u2019t think he owes you anything just because of what you have done or sacrificed in your past, especially if he thanked you and already showed he was grateful for your help. like yes, it\u2019s nice when someone is able to \u201crepay\u201d favors but no one should hold things over someone\u2019s head, nor should anyone DO things with the intention of getting a favor out of it in the future. \n2. he did offer to pay for an uber, which you declined, it\u2019s not like he completely left you stranded. \n3. yeah, I may be a little irritated if I come home and see my partner gaming but.. exhaustion/unwinding after a long week looks different for everyone. I have adhd, even when I\u2019m physically exhausted it usually takes my brain a few hours to catch up and tire out. and tbh if I am home and comfy after a long work week, NOTHING is getting me out of my house unless it is an absolute emergency. especially in the summer when it\u2019s hot as balls out. if I\u2019m home and comfy, I\u2019m staying in for the night. \n\nI\u2019m sorry he didn\u2019t come get you. maybe just try having an open conversation and saying it hurt you and frustrated you a bit that he wasn\u2019t able to help in this situation when you have tried to help him a lot in the past.", "YTA. Rides are about getting places, not about who is operating the vehicle. Your apparent objective wasn't to travel, your objective was for him to drive you. \n\nPlus, 8:30 at night is anywhere from really early, to average, to really late depending on your schedule. So, without more info, the time isn't relevant. And, if it's a 10 minute drive, then it's probably a 15-30 minute walk. \n\nWould it have been nice for him to do? Sure. Is he in the wrong for suggesting a different means of being driven? No.", "Definitely NTA. Coming from somone who has also played taxi driver for far too long, to seemingly ungrateful partners.

(absolutely not dissing uber drivers, just is clearly going to be more of a relaxed drive with your partner) \n\nHave you told him hiw it's made you feel and how did he react to this?  Also is this a pattern, does he often let you down when he has committed to doing something for you?", "YTA probably given he said he\u2019d arrange an uber.

You have gone out of your way to help your partner on numerous occasions and he won\u2019t do the same for you one time. I\u2019m certain you were also exhausted at 6:30am but you still drove him to work every day. Uber is not the safest thing for women, especially alone at night, and just not the same thing.

His job starts at 7AM and it's a more than 30 minute commute so he's leaving the house before 6:30AM. He starts two hours earlier than most people so he's probably as tired at 8:30PM as most people are at 10:30PM. He offered to pay for an Uber so it's not like he left you stranded. You shouldn't keep score in a relationship and expect him to pay you back tit-for-tat\n\nEdit: His job is also physical labour so no wonder he was so tired lol", "NTA.

And he won't let anyone drive it.", "Most cars in the US are automatic and with the amount of commuting the average American does, most of the people I know who drove manual cars in the past ended up going with an automatic later on just to cut out the hassle of dealing with it in stop and go traffic for an hour.\n\nWhen a close friend of mine lived out in the boonies, he loved driving manual. After moving to the city, he ditched it for an automatic because it was a pain in the ass.", "He was playing a damn video game, not running on a treadmill.", "He was playing video games.

I actually drove her every morning to work too like OP did for several months but I would never ask anything from her in return for that.\n\nBut yeah probably I'm oversensitive to people not understanding when a person is tired or just need a break.\n\nSure sometimes you HAVE to help, but this doesn't seem to be one of these times, as uber was obviously an option...", "But he did help her out. This is the part that folks are missing; he recognized his exhaustion would be unsafe for driving, and offered to provide her a way home regardless.

Also, the boyfriend offered to get an uber. OP wanted to get home, he offered her a way to do that.", "OP laid out his schedule in a comment.

So this demonstrates that he's awake enough to go and pick up his partner. \n\nIt's just selfish and shows a lack of respect for their partner after all they've done for him.", "They obviously aren't chronically exhausted as they are awake and actively doing an activity, unlike watching TV or doing nothing.\n\nThis person is obviously reading into it too much and taking everything said at face value.

OP's bf is displaying classic self-interest and lack of team effort for his domestic partner.  He was playing video games when she got home.  If he has the energy for video games, he has the energy to follow through on driving 10 minutes to pick up his spouse, like they had already agreed upon.  He's 35.

It's one instance, and he offered to call and pay for the uber.  This should be a non-issue.\n\nOnly if a pattern emerges should this become a thing.", "We think he was exhausted because we were told he said he was exhausted.  What reason do you have to doubt that?\n\nAnd despite gaming being more active than watching tv, you're ignoring one big factor.  You get tired and pass out while playing a game, you lose the game.
