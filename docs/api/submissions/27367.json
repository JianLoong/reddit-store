Myself and my 2 half siblings inherited a piece of property with a mobile home.  One of my siblings moved in to it.  An appraisal was obtained and I agreed to sell my share to them for roughly 60% of the value of my share.  Over the last 2 years, I paid for probate with no help from either of my siblings.  To keep creditors from forcing the place to be sold to pay medical costs, we had it moved to the 3 of our names.  It's been over 2 years, I have pled with them to buy me out or agree to sell.  I have a business and home I am on the verge of losing due to the economy and am struggling to keep my head above water.  The sibling living in the residence is going through a lot too, I understand this.  I have purchased things to send her to help in the past.  I've not received so much as a message letting me know she received the things I sent, even though she has.  That sibling told me if Id give her 6 months to try to get a loan, if she couldn't after that period, she would agree to put it up for sale without me needing to use legal means. That 6 month period ended in April of 2023. After she told me basically she didn't care about my situation, and would keep the place because it means more to her than to me, I decided to give her notice that if she couldn't buy me out, I would be contacting an attorney to use the court system to force it to be sold and  the price I was willing to sell before is off the table, I want fair market value.   The place is in disaray.  The little 2 bedroom houses at minimum 3 adults and 5 children.  With her share she could relocate and have a down payment for something bigger.  They both let me know what  piece of garbage I am for forcing it to be sold.  Am I supposed to loose everything I've worked for now so she doesn't have to move with money in her pocket?", "created_utc": 1695339730, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ov7jt/aita_for_using_the_court_system_to_help_me/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
