They are all very nice people.\n\n I had to explain to my husband though that there is a difference between our parents when they come over. When my parents come over they help with the house. My mom helps clean and cook, she brings food.  My dad helps with projects. They even clean their room and their sheets before they leave They even help us financially. They have a long track record of being helpful. So I'm a little bit more comfortable having them over when the baby is little and everything is hard. \n\nMy in-laws are also lovely, but when they come over I have to be a *host*. They want to come over and visit and catch up with me and their son. Normally I have no issue with that, but I'm going to be exhausted and tired and I'm not going to want to clean my whole house make everybody meals and prepare my kitchen and spend 5 hours every night chatting with everyone. I just am going to want to spend time with my baby and sleeping. \n\nI also had to explain to my husband that there is a difference between having somebody there to help you change the baby, feed the baby, burp the baby, clean the house, make food and somebody that just wants to hold the baby when the baby is happy and cooing and then give it back to mom when they poop. I want to to spend the good moments with my baby too. \n\nThis will be both of my grandmother's first grandchild and we've been trying to get pregnant for several years. So there's a lot of anticipation. We will let my in-laws over but I'm going to have to explain to them that while they can come over, I will not be *hosting* at this time. And because of who my father-in-law is as a person (loud, sits on the couch and drinks and yells at baseball games on TV,  complains alot etc) I'm going to want them as a presence around less often. \n\nAm I the asshole for saying that I would be more comfortable having my parents over more often than his parents after our baby is born?", "created_utc": 1697735910, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17bocb6/aita_for_wanting_unequal_baby_visitation_between/", "score": 81, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t actually have to host your in-laws. You will be tired and you want /*need* to spend time with the baby and sleeping.\n\nSo\u2026 *don\u2019t* host. Let your husband clean the house, entertain his parents for five hours in the evening, and either cook, get takeout, or take his parents out to dinner, (while bringing you home something of your choice from the menu of whatever place he wants to take his parents to.). \n\nYou are NTA for not wanting to play Stepford Wife to your in-laws when you have other, more important things to do and you have a husband to play host. You aren\u2019t June Cleaver. This isn\u2019t the 1950\u2019s. \n\nAnd *your husband* can explain to *his parents* what the new reality will be. You don\u2019t have to be the bad guy here.

If they complain, they gotta go. If FIL is too loud he needs to be quiet. If they can\u2019t abide they gotta go.\n\nTake your baby back from MIL whenever you want. Feel free to leave the room at any time.", "NTA. You're right in the differences you're pointing out. Having a baby is crazy. You have this major medical event and then guess what, you also can't sleep, your body doesn't belong to you, and you have to do everything for this tiny, helpless, human. Hosting family members on top of all this is ridiculous and no one should expect it of you. \n\nA compromise could be that you will not host at all and your husband makes it clear to his parents that this isn't strictly a social call. Anyone who visits more than an hour, has to help out. \n\nHowever, I don't think you should make the compromise that your husband plays host either (though that would be fair in most other circumstances). What I found was that my husband was spending so much time hosting his family that I got no help with the baby and things I needed when I was immobile.", "Info can you let it happen and not host? Tell him, you did the physical work of birthing a child, he gets to do the physical work of hosting.  And then don't do any work.  Anything they want, 'ask hubby'.  If he asks you, 'you're the host, remember?'", "NTA it\u2019s helpful for your husband to understand the difference between a support person and a visitor", "NTA because your parents will help. His need to understand that they need to help too", "NTA honestly it's hard to have stressful people around after you have your first baby.  Our families are both geographically close so there was no issue of staying with us but my parents would come help meaning my dad would stock my fridge (i would just tell him healthy and easy to make foods and he would go shopping) and my mom would straighten up and help with the baby.  My mom and bff came over one day and organized pretty much the whole nursery for me (in our culture presents are given after birth and i was struggling a bit so house was full of boxes of unopened presents). My MIL would come \"help\" and I'd always end up crying after, she would stress me out and ask me a thousand questions about everything she offered to help with and it was just the worst.  I'm on baby 3 now so IDGAF about most things lol and she's great with my older two so things definitely do change but yeah I would try to limit their visits in the beginning or ask that they stay in a hotel or something. Oh I was also struggling with breastfeeding so was trying to nurse or pumping like 24/7 and I refused to not do that on my couch because I wasn't going to move all my stuff every time we had a visitor or go hide in my room, I'd throw on a blanket but that was it so that's another reason to not have too many ILs around at first.", "What ever happened to \"make yourself at home\" or \"we don't stand on formalities here\" and put them at ease?   Nobody said you have to host anyone.     Children need to know both sides of a family and it seems like unconsciously (I hope) you're saying your parents win.", "Perhaps this is something your husband can talk to his parents about.\n\nWhen my daughter was first on her own, if I tried to help at her apartment she would feel insulted and that I didn\u2019t trust her to handle her own affairs. She wanted me to sit back and be hosted.\n\nIt may be a sign of respect and acceptance that they don\u2019t help clean or cook. But because your parents behave differently, it doesn\u2019t feel respectful to you.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work for you now, and they will need to be told.", "Info:Do you know that they will have the same expectations when you have a baby? You are talking as if you already know exactly how this will all go, even though you have no evidence to base it on yet.", "NTA as this is common, however are you assuming they will behave this way based solely on past experience with you and your partner? Some grandparents step it up and revert to mom/dad mode and do a lot to help out when grandchildren arrive.", "INFO\n\n* First, have the baby.\n* Invite your in-laws over.\n\nEven if its worst case outcome, you can deal with it one time & *then* you can be TA.... if warranted.  I know is stressful and cRaZy for you, I really do... but you need to chill just a little bit.   You're responding as if you are certain they're going to make things harder for you... no matter how they've visited in the past, you really have no clue what they're going to be like as grandparents.\n\nI consider myself very much like your parents..... but guess what... I'm passing dirty-diaper-baby back to mom... or dad... or grandma.    Even if I do that every time, YOU only have to deal with it 33% if I pass equally.", "NTA, and why on earth isn\u2019t your husband doing all the cooking and cleaning and hosting if it\u2019s his parents that aren\u2019t contributing?", "NTA but... you are setting up drama if you tell them this outright vs once the baby is there, you can say 'we aren't up for guests' etc and then provide context of your parents aren't guests when they are over ... IF NEEDED.\n\nIt is one thing to express this to your husband so he understands where you are coming from but it would be stirring the pot to spell it out before it has happened.\n\nAlso you have to also factor in that ppl do not always offer to help bc they are not comfortable doing so. Many ppl find it easier to take care of their own home. It's normal for some parents to feel that way and normal for others not to but it doesn't mean they wouldn't help if helping can be clearly defined and feasible to them.\n\n\"We would love to see you however we are just exhausted this week. Would you want to bring over dinner and we could spend time together then?\" If you MIL is a great cook at a few things - \"I know the early days are going to be nuts - would you be able to prepare us a few of your famous X portions to freeze? Or come over and assist while I do some batch cooking?\"", "Gently YTA. You do not need to host your in laws. They\u2019re are capable adults. And so is DH! He or they can entertain his parents/themselves. He and they both can cook, clean, help with baby etc. \n\nWhile i understand completely what you\u2019re saying about the difference between you parents and your in laws, but you\u2019re kind of creating a hypothetical problem for yourself here. You can change this dynamic once you baby has a arrived and it can even be discussed before they visit! FIL can be told to quiet down, MIL can be asked to help around the house or cook dinner etc, not just hog the baby. \n\nAnd if they don\u2019t like or agree with the new dynamic when they visit, then I can understand not having them over as often. But give it a chance before you go down that road. Fix the \u201cproblem\u201d before it becomes an actual problem!", "NTA at all as a new mama myself there is a huge difference between the types of visitors you are describing \ud83e\udd23 perhaps don't put it to your husband that way just make some ground rules for all visitors maybe? But I totally get it parenthood is draining enough without adding to a gigantic to do list! Congratulations btw!", "NTA. People visiting new parents should offer to cook, clean & ask what the Mom, Baby & Dad needs help with. They should NOT expect to hold baby & have Mom, OR Dad wait on them. Congratulations \ud83c\udf89 & good luck OP!", "YTA for assuming how both sides will react. Having a baby involved changes everything. They'll understand your tired, I promise. Yes, your parents might be more helpful, but you've also never seen your in-laws in this scenario. They may be just as helpful. You won't know until they come. \n\nSo, if you're willing to cause friction among the family over this (because if you've spent any time #OnHere, you know this kind of thing causes it), by all means go forward with your plan. Otherwise, give both sides the opportunity to show you how it goes. Besides, you have the ultimate \"I'm not doing that\" card: you birthed their 1st grandkid!", "INFO: Are you talking about initial visits for when you and your husband decide visitors are welcome to see the baby?\n\nBecause immediately postpartum, I can see your point of wanting the extra support. But other than that I think your expectations of visits where you invite people into your home may be a bit muddled. \n\nI am the person that when someone needs the help, I go over with the sole purpose of helping with household tasks and providing food etc. but by no means is that my *typical* way of visiting someone nor is it an expectation I would tolerate from someone.", "INFO \n\n>and somebody that just wants to hold the baby when the baby is happy and cooing and then give it back to mom when they poop.\n\nDo you have proof this is how they'll behave? It seems like up to now when your in laws come over they've been invited to visit. Visitors are not obligated to clean or help. When your parents come over they volunteer to do things. Neither set of parents is wrong.", "INFO:  you do understand that it is your husbands child just as much as it is yours, yeah?  Is he on board with you gatekeeping the child from his parents because YOU (only you) don't like how they do certain things?", "NTA - your parents sound like help and your in-laws sound like work. But I\u2019d encourage you to invite them over equally at the beginning anyway, with the clear statement that you will not be hosting - if they would like to eat while there, they should bring or make food themselves, they should expect to share the couch with a load of unfolded laundry, etc\u2026 \n\nIf they ignore the \u201cimperfections\u201d and still want to come (even if they don\u2019t actually help with chores), that\u2019s good for the baby if you can handle it. If they complain or make snide comments, they\u2019re uninviting themselves.", "ESH. You make a lot of assumptions on future behavior. Have you had a discussion with anyone about what your preferences are for house guests? Or maybe what your needs will be post-delivery? People aren't  psychic. When the in-laws start asking about coming to visit the new baby, have your husband let them know what the expectations are.", "NTA but I think you are creating a problem before one is presented, and also taking the wrong approach to fixing it. \n\nUnless both sets of grandparents are asking now for a visiting schedule, you don't have to come up with \"unequal visitation.\" The only thing you should be deciding now is who is at the birth, who is at the hospital, and when and who can come over once you are home, and for how long. \n\nWhen it comes to visits once you are home, I'd tell everyone you will decide that once you are home. You could want a lot of help, you could want to be alone with the baby. If you have medical issues, you likely will want your parents around more and that is fair. My friends have needed some...intimate assistance and they want their mom with them, not inlaws, and you aren't just bringing a baby home to be shown off, you are recovering and deserve to be comfortable. I love my partner's mom, but when I am in pain recovering, I want my mom and I want to have a meltdown with my mom.\n\nAnd then in regards to hosting the inlaws in general- or any other visitors. You can tell your husband anyone he invites over, or for his family, well he needs to host them. You will not be getting people snacks or cleaning up, anyone who comes over is getting to hold the baby for a shower, will be given a chore, and should bring food. And if your husband thinks his parents should be treated like guests, then he can fill that role.", "YTA. It's great that your parents help out, but that doesn't make your in-laws any less excited about their grandchild. Playing favorites with grandparent visitation is unfair and will only cause tension in the family. Instead of dictating unequal terms, try communicating openly and finding ways for both sets of grandparents to contribute positively. Remember, everyone's excited about the baby, and your in-laws deserve a chance to bond without feeling like second-class grandparents.", "YTA, because right now you are, as my Nana would say, \"borrowing trouble\".  None of this has happened yet and you have no idea what they will be like once a child comes along.  Maybe you are right and maybe you aren't.  Let's say you are right.  Well, you will have to adjust their expectations by saying \"I'd love to get you tea, but a person just came out of me and there's the kitchen.  Tea bags are on the left shelf\".  And \"FIL, the baby is sleeping and I'm turning down the volume of your tv show.  Stop yelling\".", "YTA. You\u2019re wanting to favor your parents and just making up reasons to do so.

Tell your husband that he is responsible for fixing them drinks, etc.", "YWBTA - your in-laws could change once the kid is here, you have no idea how they are going to act towards you and/or the child. Hell, your parents behavior could change once the kid is born.\n\nIf you are so concerned, have conversation with them about your expectations and concerns.\n\nIt\u2019s an AH move to preemptively punish them for behavior they haven\u2019t demonstrated.", "YTA.. you have no idea how they actually will act when they\u2019re there once you have the baby.

Nope. \n\nYou\u2019re judging them because you want to judge them.", "[deleted]", "I dunno here, there\u2019s some variables. I would be tempted to think about your parents\u2019 visits from your husband\u2019s POV though. Is it possible that he gets displaced, finds stuff being done he didn\u2019t want doing, or that his stuff gets interfered with? Do the three of you egg each other on into projects that are not what he wanted or at an inconvenient time for him?\n\nI suppose what I\u2019m getting at is whether the two of you have completely different perceptions of the same events.", "ESH. You because you are anticipating a problem before it exists.  You don't have the baby yet.    Them expecting you to host when they come over is normal.  we are the type that come in and offer help, but often it is refused.  Do you not host friends when they come over?  Why isn't your husband helping host when people come over?  Most people's behavior changes when they visit new parents.  Have you ever asked his parents for help?  They could change once their is a baby present.  Your husband should be the one speaking with his parents.", "Nah, you are setting an expectation with your husband. That hosting will be too much to do often for you. However do not close yourself off that they could possibly become helpful. Congratulations on the baby. Keep open communication.", "NTA. I understand what you\u2019re saying (and find it pretty patronizing that others are calling into question your 5 years of experience). \n\nBut you also can\u2019t forbid your in-laws to come over and keep the peace. I\u2019d suggest you reiterate your reasonable fears to your husband and lay out, in your conversation with him, your expectations from his behavior (which also means not spending tons of time entertaining his parents while you\u2019re dealing with a newborn). \n\nTogether, you can write something nice - definitely *not* passive aggressive - about how you\u2019re looking forward to having them come visit but, considering you\u2019re recovering and you both will have a new baby, you won\u2019t be able to host the same way. Tell them they\u2019re welcome to the fridge, provide takeout or quick dinners and that\u2019s it. Breakfast can be cereal and milk. You just need your minimize your stress.", "Kinda yta because have you talked to them yet to advise of the change in how you will \u201chost\u201d. \n\nIf you go into the convo saying \u201cand for these reasons we\u2019ll not be seeing you as much\u201d that\u2019s hella rude to them.

At first he was defensive by the premise but when I explained my above reasonings he seemed to understand my concerns with me not wanting to play hostess", "I don't really want my husband to host either because I need him to be helping me. And this is another concern because he always wants to meet their expectations.", "This all day.", ">I go to someone\u2019s home, I do expect them to host because it is their home\n\nThat's fine. But if people are going to expect me to host when I have a newborn in my house, then they will not be invited. I will not be offering to host anybody with a newborn. \n\nIf grandparents want to see the baby, then they should not expect to be hosted.", "Based on five years of experience of them coming over and expecting to be hosted. They have an exhibited any behavior to show otherwise. \n\nAlso, my upbringing in my husband's were very different. My husband and his brothers were mostly raised by nannies. Both of his parents worked. When they got old enough they were just sort of left to their own devices and expected to entertain each other.", ">would be tempted to think about your parents\u2019 visits from your husband\u2019s POV though. Is it possible that he gets displaced, finds stuff being done he didn\u2019t want doing, or that his stuff gets interfered with?\n\nMy dad calls me every time before he comes down and asks me what projects I need done so that he can bring the right tools, and me and my husband pick the projects. My husband and I usually help him and my husband has never had a problem with him working on projects. He has always been very grateful for it for him getting the thing done that he just doesn't have time or tools for", "Normally I have no problem hosting people. I love hosting people. I host my friends and my in-laws all the time. I also usually trade off with my parents when they come over and I'll make them dinner too . My in-laws came over two weekends ago, We went out to dinner, I made them breakfast, we spent time chatting for hours. We had a good time. \n\nBut when I have a newborn in my house I will not be hosting anyone. Not my friends, not my parents, not my in-laws. My husband does help host in that he helps with cleaning the dishes and keeping people entertained. \n\n>Have you ever asked his parents for help?\n\nI have asked his dad for help before. His dad is an electrician and he has come over to help do electrician work at my house twice in the last few years. The first time we got an argument for an hour about where I was going to put my water heater which had nothing to do with the work he was doing for me. The other time he spent an hour trying to convince me to do something not to code because doing it right was more labor intensive, and assuring me that the inspector would not notice. Both times it was frankly more stress than I think it was worth because he just found something to complain and argue about. (I will put an aside then at both times he was dealing with family trauma, so I swept it under the rug) \n\nI have also done work for him. I designed the website for his business.", "We used to have this problem with my FIL - post partum your husband needs to be supporting you. Have them over, but get your husband (not you), to explain how things are going to be, and he also needs to run interference during their visit. E.g - he tells them it's easy oven/microwave meals, and they're doing the washing up; he doesn't stock beer in the house (FIL can go to the shops and pick up groceries at the same time); he needs to tell his dad to turn the TV down etc.", "You can\u2019t make the choice for your husband. Does he understand how much you do when his parents visit? It could be good for him to handle everything while you sleep / care for the baby. He has to set that boundary for himself.", "After he does all the work a couple of times, he\u2019s going to be waaaaay more receptive to your point of view.", "Because OP is having a baby and they expect to be hosted. OP will be healing, she and her husband will be exhausted from adjusting to baby, who won't sleep through the night and don't have the bandwidth to host.\n\nThe idea is visitors don't make work for the new patents, hosting people is work.", "Here the issue is not having bandwidth to host people. Or people holding baby until diaper needs changing, then expect exhausted, healing mum to change it", "but you also haven\u2019t had children. i\u2019m not going to a persons house and clean for no reason, now when my sister had her baby, i did go and clean her house and help her out.", "I hope your parenting skills are not as bad as your reading comprehension", ">I also had to explain to my husband that there is a difference between having somebody there to help you change the baby, feed the baby, burp the baby, clean the house, make food and somebody that just wants to hold the baby when the baby is happy and cooing and then give it back to mom when they poop. I want to to spend the good moments with my baby too. \n\nEvidence of this? I assume you've seen them do this with your husband's nieces and nephews? Otherwise you're just making negative assumptions.", "Well you know them better than we do. Some grandparents are definitely only there to \"visit\". Those can come later. Best to avoid in the immediate term as you'll be exhausted.\n\nNothing wrong with giving them the benefit of the doubt, though.", "My husband\u2019s parents raised him the same way. Neither was really helpful with babies (or small children in general, really). It\u2019s fine, but definitely don\u2019t go out of your way and don\u2019t change any routines for them when they do visit. Do what you need to do.

That seems like creating an issue before there is one and creating conflict with your husband where you could simply just communicate with him what you would like visits to look like and your concern over hosting. No need to introduce a dynamic of ranking between your parents. \n\nI also think you could sit with your own expectations of parents visiting and work through some of that. For example, do they \"have\" to help out? Why? What is helpful and how will you communicate to them?", "Yes that's fine but you want to restrict your in laws visits without them doing anything wrong yet.", "Well he has to put you and the baby first, but you won't know if he can do that until you see it in action. His parents come over (as they should, they want to meet the baby, you want them in your life, you just decide when you want them over) and if he wants X, Y, Z for them, he takes the lead but also needs to be able to do his parenting duties. \n\nThe reality is, people are going to come over and meet the baby. You do not both need to be caring for the baby the whole time, and you can absolutely limit visitors to make sure you are taking care of yourself and the baby. But his parents should be among the visitors, and if you assume all these things will go wrong/you will host/he won't help, and therefore don't let them come over, you are creating a big problem. It is better to set expectations and see what happens, and stick to your guns (no you won't be cooking dinner, no he can't sit and chat with them for hours) and then decide what to do after the visit about the next one.", "I know this is your first... but seriously... how hard do you think this is?  Babies eat, sleep, shit, and repeat.  Toss in a few cries.  You will be exhausted for probably at least the first month... but not so much that you will need to sleep when baby sleeps unless your baby is a nightmare baby.  Your husband's every moment will not need to be dedicated to helping.  \n\nIt doesn't matter if your in-laws behave like guests in your home (as they should have) when they are visiting you and your husband.  They might actually be trying to respect your autonomy and not risk you thinking they're trying to take over.\n\nWhen grandbabies are involved... it changes.  If you are sitting there with a baby you can't soothe... try to stop a grandma from offering to help.  My ex's mom swooped on every dirty diaper my oldest had when he was little... the the point the ex believed I was taking advantage of his mother making her do all the work.  I had to explain to him that I wasn't making her... I was letting her.  She seemed to really want to do it.  So did I (it was my first after all) but I knew that I would have plenty of time when she wasn't around to do it.\n\nYou're borrowing trouble where none exists... and quite likely creating more that should never exist in the process.", "And that\u2019s true - newborn = no hosting but you have no idea how they will be when you have the baby. They may be helpful and not expect you to host, or they\u2019ll then to your husband to take over hosting duties. \n\nYou need to be a grown up and tell them they can visit but you can\u2019t host them.

Yeah, she sure as shit can.", "I mean she kind of can decide that she wants her husband to be a parent to his own child instead of playing host.", "This is all under the presumption that that is what they will expect. Nothing has been said yet it\u2019s just basing it off past experiences when the situation was entirely different.

Sure your mom helps when she's there but you can't expect all guests to act like that. I have never gone to visit some one and stayed cleaning their house or cooking for them. You also want to prohibit your husband from entertaining people because he needs to be by your side, along with your mom. You're having a baby, baring major complications,  it's not that big of a deal. Stop acting helpless and entitled.", ">Also this is their first grandbaby.\n\nSo the answer is no, it's not based on anything you've seen. \n\nI had nannies when I was a child, and my mother is the best granny ever known. \n\nHow they expect to be treated as guests in their adult child's house is not automatically how they will act when they're visiting their grandchildren. You're making a tonne of negative assumptions about your in-laws. You could well be right, but by explaining to your husband that his parents will be shit grandparents (with no idea how they'll be) you seem judgy and rude.

When you fall asleep because your medications make you tired, they tuck your blanket around you and slip out quietly. \n\nWhen Friend B comes over, they don't bring you any food or any \"get well soon\" gifts. In fact, they're hungry and tell you to get up (yes, even though you're on crutches) and make them some macaroni. They spend the whole time talking about their own problems.
