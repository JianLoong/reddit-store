A couple in their late twenties with four small children. The wife is a SAHM and the husband is a trucker. I went to introduce myself and bring them a pie right after they moved in. I didn\u2019t really like their vibe but I\u2019m a friendly person so I tried inviting the wife to things. \n\nOur neighborhood is small, a collection of ten houses. Everyone knows everyone and is generally pretty friendly. No one else has young kids though. It\u2019s mostly couples with no kids, or older couples who\u2019s kids moved out. I hang out with two of my female neighbors who are a similar age to my own (mid twenties). We go on walks, have lunch at each others houses, etc. I only work three days a week so I have a lot of free time. \n\nI invited the new neighbor, Molly, to two different things. Lunch at my house and also a walk/hike me and the others were going on. Both time she just assumed she could bring her kids and showed up to my house with them. I turned her away from lunch at my house because I don\u2019t want four rowdy kids under the age of six in my not childproof house. She was upset because she has no one who can ever watch them, and she can\u2019t come without them. She did bring them on a walk with us but we couldn\u2019t go in the forest because of her stroller so it kind of ruined things for us. There\u2019s no trees or shade in the neighborhood and the summer heat makes it awful, the forest is much better.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been avoiding Molly like the plague, I just don\u2019t want to be her friend. She\u2019s invited me over, asked to come over and bring her kids, she even asked me to watch her kids the other day so she can have a break. I barely know the woman and I feel like her behavior is pretty inappropriate and she\u2019s maybe just not picking up on social cues. \n\nToday me and my other neighbors went for a walk in the forest, and she saw us go. She texted me to ask why she wasn\u2019t invited, and I said it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want our plans to be altered by her children, and she\u2019s expressed that she can\u2019t do anything without her children. She went on a rant about how it takes a village and we don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, and she called us all assholes. \n\nI agree with her that I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, because I would personally never choose to have four kids with an absent husband. I just feel like she\u2019s being unreasonable to expect us to have a bad time just so she can have a good time. Her kids were super annoying and hard to deal with. My husband thinks she\u2019s an asshole but my mom thinks I should be more sympathetic. \n\nAITA for excluding my neighbor from activities?\n\nEdit: ok since you guys wanted me to add it, I\u2019ll add it. I asked molly if she had any food allergies and if she was okay with salmon and quinoa for lunch. She had the opportunity to mention she wanted to bring her kids and chose not to take it. I did not make enough food to feed her four kids, because I had no clue she planned on bringing them. I only made food for 4, not 8. Also, when we went on a walk the original plan was to walk in the forest. But at last minute she unilaterally decided we as a group should change our plans and walk the neighborhood instead because her stroller can\u2019t go in the forest. \n\nShe also said \u201cyou\u2019re all a bunch of bitches for not making things easier on a mom\u201d so yeah, bridge burned. Sucks to suck Molly.\n\nEdit 2: it\u2019s like some or y\u2019all have never heard of a babysitter before.

Yes 4 kids is hard, but they're not your responsibility, and Molly's wellbeing isn't as well.", "NTA. You gave her a chance; she wasn't interested enough to make arrangements for her kids.

And she\u2019s not required to be Molly\u2019s BFF.\n\nMolly, as soon as she realized none of the neighbors had children and didn\u2019t do kid friendly activities, should have pivoted and (a) asked if kids were welcome at these invitations, and (b) upon realizing this wasn\u2019t a kid friendly group, started looking for a friend group that was (playgrounds, library, etc).  I feel bad for her, I\u2019ve been in her position, but it\u2019s not ever ok to force your children into kid-free activities.", "NTA. I have kids and wouldn't presume I can bring my kids to outings with friends who don't have kids unless they explicitly invite me.

Molly brought five people total and expected op to accommodate her. What if op didn\u2019t have enough food to feed an extra four people?

She is acting like she\u2019s entitled to ur time and company but she isn\u2019t, being a neighbor doesn\u2019t equal having to be friends.  Idk why people are being ridiculous, they\u2019re trying to get you to be friends with a person that you do not enjoy being around, you and ur friends in the neighborhood had a schedule and just because she moved in that doesn\u2019t mean your life\u2019s now have to shift to accommodate her.

When you invite her to go places where tf else would the kids be? Come on now. \n\nMolly: she wasn\u2019t an asshole until the whole watch my kids thing and it takes a village. That\u2019s foolish when you don\u2019t even know the people watching your kids. \n\nBack to you. That snippy shit about having kids with an absent father is stupid and unnecessary.

Villagers include parents, siblings, extended family.", "This was a hard one to judge. I could see myself agreeing with E S H comments but ultimately, after reading your other comments, I'm settling on NTA. \n\nYou described your first encounter as the husband being rude and Molly asking help with the furniture. I think Molly is just in a terribly exhausting situation and is looking for all the help she can get, which is great if the neighbors are willing to help, but crosses a line if molly expects the whole neighborhood to help raise her kids. This is the vibe I'm getting from Molly through your comments. I feel like if you help her out with one measly task, she'll wiggle her way in and you'd become a permanent babysitter for Molly, especially because you said you only work 3 days a week. \n\nYou're right to be concerned about kids running around in your non baby proofed house, because if they did get hurt in your house, I can only imagine how Molly and her husband would react. \n\nThat being said, I think you can still try to be friendly with Molly while keeping your boundaries. If there are any kid friendly activities going on in the neighborhood, let her know. If your other neighbourhood friends want to host Molly at their house, be cordial. But be wary of any future babysitting requests.", "NTA for not inviting her on things you don't consider child-friendly. You still could be her friend though and socialize with her on other occasions, if you like her otherwise.", "NTA. I don't have children, but a lot of my friends do. We sometimes do things that aren't suitable for children and they either leave them behind or miss those events. Much like I take a pass on bounce house parties with 30 kids. It's  a lot harder for balance when only one person has kids. I wouldn't change my girlfriend time just due to one person I didn't really vibe with. But maybe you could throw her a bone occasionally.", "NTA your neighbour needed to ask \"is it OK to bring my kids?\" each time. You do come across a little judgemental here though.", "NTA. Molly sounds entitled as shit.", "NTA. I h\u00e2te that whole it takes a village bullshit. If you choose to have kids that\u2019s on you.

Not your kids, not your problem.  Your neighbour needs to build up some cred before asking for favours and free childcare. I get her frustration, but that is nothing to do with you.\n\nBut still, you are neighbours. It always pays to be cordial. Bake another pie for the kids? Maybe set up a time where you can do some outdoorsy stuff, but in her/your back yard? Keeps the little darlings out of your house and gives your neighbour a bit of \"adult time\". She probably misses having an adult to talk to. Yes, her approach was poor, but don't hold it against her. Hell, her kids might be paying the taxes that pay for YOUR Social Security some day!", "NTA.

It\u2019s hard not having support and then she would have thought she was getting support from you only to be pushed away repeatedly - how isolating for her.

Her for the village thing, but man. You started it. You knew she was home with those kids, when you invited her to lunch and on a walk, where did you think she was going to stow them?

It\u2019s definitely not safe. I would not just have shown up at a near strangers house with four little kids without asking the person about bringing them or instead asking if they could come to my house because it\u2019s childproofed.\n\nIf someone had invited me on a walk and I knew I had to bring my kids, I would ask things like how far are we going and where, because I had four kids.\n\nAnd I would never ask a child free person to watch my four little kids unless it was a very good friend or relative who knew them, knew what they were like and what it took to take care of them.\n\nIt\u2019s just a level of chaos and the need for constant attention to four tiny people that you have to get used to doing and have a tremendous amount of energy to handle.\n\nI see women out in public with their own big group of little kids, and I want to tell them their lives don\u2019t have to be this difficult, that they don\u2019t have to follow some religious BS or misogynistic idea that a woman needs to have kid after kid after kid. They always look exhausted and so stressed.\n\nSo I feel bad for that mom, but she\u2019s not entitled to  have other people help her with her kids. She made her choices.

Libraries usually have story/craft times for kids where she can meet other parents. Visit the local parks and recreation office and get info on summer camps and other activities for children. Some places like the zoo have free admission days. Everything she does should involve meeting other parents with kids.

A couple in their late twenties with four small children. The wife is a SAHM and the husband is a trucker. I went to introduce myself and bring them a pie right after they moved in. I didn\u2019t really like their vibe but I\u2019m a friendly person so I tried inviting the wife to things. \n\nOur neighborhood is small, a collection of ten houses. Everyone knows everyone and is generally pretty friendly. No one else has young kids though. It\u2019s mostly couples with no kids, or older couples who\u2019s kids moved out. I hang out with two of my female neighbors who are a similar age to my own (mid twenties). We go on walks, have lunch at each others houses, etc. I only work three days a week so I have a lot of free time. \n\nI invited the new neighbor, Molly, to two different things. Lunch at my house and also a walk/hike me and the others were going on. Both time she just assumed she could bring her kids and showed up to my house with them. I turned her away from lunch at my house because I don\u2019t want four rowdy kids under the age of six in my not childproof house. She was upset because she has no one who can ever watch them, and she can\u2019t come without them. She did bring them on a walk with us but we couldn\u2019t go in the forest because of her stroller so it kind of ruined things for us. There\u2019s no trees or shade in the neighborhood and the summer heat makes it awful, the forest is much better.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been avoiding Molly like the plague, I just don\u2019t want to be her friend. She\u2019s invited me over, asked to come over and bring her kids, she even asked me to watch her kids the other day so she can have a break. I barely know the woman and I feel like her behavior is pretty inappropriate and she\u2019s maybe just not picking up on social cues. \n\nToday me and my other neighbors went for a walk in the forest, and she saw us go. She texted me to ask why she wasn\u2019t invited, and I said it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want our plans to be altered by her children, and she\u2019s expressed that she can\u2019t do anything without her children. She went on a rant about how it takes a village and we don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, and she called us all assholes. \n\nI agree with her that I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, because I would personally never choose to have four kids with an absent husband. I just feel like she\u2019s being unreasonable to expect us to have a bad time just so she can have a good time. Her kids were super annoying and hard to deal with. My husband thinks she\u2019s an asshole but my mom thinks I should be more sympathetic. \n\nAITA for excluding my neighbor from activities?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to have to include her kids in your outings with your friends. I have nothing at all against mothers or children. On the contrary, I love little children (when they\u2019re not brats), and I raised two kids of my own. \n\nBut at this point in my life, I absolutely do not want to hang out with kids, especially badly behaved ones. I don\u2019t want them in my non-childproofed house, I don\u2019t want to have to adjust my plans to accommodate kids. I definitely don\u2019t want to go to specifically child friendly events or places, because I do not want to deal with the noise, etc. and the chance that there will be AH parents there who think it\u2019s fine to let their kids run wild and disrupt other people\u2019s relaxation and enjoyment.\n\nIf she wants or needs to take her kids with her wherever she goes, that\u2019s fine, but it means there are some things she won\u2019t be able to do. Hanging out with a group of childless young people is one of those things. Lunch at someone\u2019s home that is not childproofed or safe for uncontrolled little kids is one of those things. A hike on a trail that can\u2019t accommodate her stroller is one of those things. \n\nIf she wants to hang out, why doesn\u2019t *she* plan to do something fun that can include her kids and invite you to join in? That would be a much better way to make friends with the neighbors than acting entitled to join you in your plans and being a total AH when she isn\u2019t invited.", "NTA.

Everyone could have been a little more graceful in their responses. Outside of that, NAH.\n\nOn a side note, it's odd that the new neighbor didn't research the area better. I know the market isn't great so it's not always a choice, but if I had kids I'd look to move to an area where they might make friends on their street, especially if my spouse was going to be away as often as Molly's. But too late for that here.", ">(a) asked if kids were welcome at these invitations\n\nHow is she not the asshole for not doing so, assuming that an invite to her is an invite to her and her kids, and as per OPs edit, completely taking over their walk and changing it in a wah that nobody wanted.", "I made salmon and quinoa for lunch anyways.

She should have asked for clarification on that. It makes sense that OP, not having children, would not have expected them to come *especially* if they are noisy and rowdy, as I expect kids under age ten to be. \nOP was neighborly, in bringing the pie. And she made an effort at being friendly. It didn\u2019t work out.

Doesn't make her reaction right, but it is an understandable, human response to being excluded. It sounds like she did try to reach out and invite you over so the kids wouldn't be running amok at someone else's home. Saying no to babysitting is fair game,  but rejecting that olive branch was a mean girls move.\n\nLong term, less stressful to have a decent relationship with neighbors especially when all it'll likely take is some brief communication on your end.

Most toddlers will gladly out hike the most spry adults. Every single friend I have with children takes them hiking. What did you think she would do with her children? Hating children is not normal.

Maybe you could suggest going to something like this with her, help her find her way around town.", "OP is NTA. The new neighbor was wrong to bring her kids to lunch without asking first. It's called good manners. The new neighbor shouldn't be asking OP to watch her kids. OP is practically a stranger. The new neighbor should get involved with play groups and other parent groups so she can meet new people.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to be friends with anyone you don\u2019t want to. Simple as that. You tried to be nice but you and your friends clearly have different interests than this woman and it\u2019s not your responsibility to make sure she has friends.", "NTA. While I don't think you handled the situation with the lunch particularly well, and while perhaps you haven't had the best responses to your new neighbor, your question was if you're an AH for excluding (or not including) your new neighbor in every activity you chose to do and invite other friends in the neighborhood to. And that answer to that is clearly NTA. You don't owe this new person friendship. You don't owe her inclusion in your plans. You certainly aren't required to cater your plans to work well for four children as a childless person. Also, even if you're best friends, you are allowed to have one-on-one time with other friends and plan activities that don't involve everyone in your circle. \n\nThis person has lived in your community for a month - she barely knows you, you barely know her, you barely know her kids. The fact that she has already asked you to babysit in a non-emergent situation and she's said \"it takes a village\" is concerning. I don't disagree with the sentiment that \"it takes a village\", but you aren't her village  - at least not yet, and possibly not ever. Your village isn't the people in the physically closest vicinity - it's the people you have the closest ties to. \n\nI do empathize with your neighbor. I'm a parent to one and my husband and I live far enough from family that they can't help us out regularly and we don't have close, helpful friends. It's hard parenting without the safety net of family and friends. However, that doesn't mean that you rely on your brand new neighbors to take on that support role. Hopefully she will find people within the community who are a better fit with her family - but you aren't it.", "NTA. You tried inviting her in the past, but it didn't work out. You don't owe someone friendship and her needing a village doesn't oblige you to provide one. It sounds like what she really needs is to find a local moms group and invest her time in people with similar life circumstances. \n\nShe can't expect childless strangers to enjoy changing their plans to cater to her and her children just because they happen to live in the same neighborhood.", "NTA because it sounds like you just don't have compatible lifestyles and you're under no obligation to change your plans or the way you spend your free time to accommodate someone else's children. I would change my plans to accommodate the children in my family or the children of my close friends in many or most cases. I wouldn't change my plans to accommodate the children of an acquaintance or a virtual stranger. You tried to include her, it didn't work out. Sometimes that happens. Also \"it takes a village\" is nonsense that I've only ever heard actually used by parents trying to guilt people into doing things they have no obligation to do. \n\nAlso I can relate to not having a child friendly home. I don't either, and when there are kids in here I am on edge the whole time worrying that they're going to get hurt or break something. Now that my nieces and nephew are a little older they understand \"don't go near that laptop, it's for aunt K's job\" or \"don't chase the old, shy cat around because he gets scared\" but with younger kids it's very hard to resist the urge to follow them around telling them not to touch things or stay away from the stairs.", "NTA.

Not at all.", "NTA. You are under no obligation to socialise with anyone.", "I would say NTA.

It was nice of you to include her in the group activities as another adult woman that's new to the neighborhood.

She is an A for assuming they were invited.  She is incredibly entitled to expect everyone else to change their plans for her kids - especially when she barely knows you.  Not that it\u2019s ever okay to do so, but I would have a little more sympathy for her if y\u2019all were in an already established friend group and she was the first one to have a kid and still wanted to participate with the group.  But even then, the parent needs to accept that their life isn\u2019t going to be the same because they have different responsibilities now\u2026 instead of trying to force everyone else to cater to their kid(s).  It sounds like you have different lifestyles and you aren\u2019t required to be friends with her.", "NTA. You invited her not four kids.

Not just the people living around you. You don\u2019t need to alter your plans all the time for the children and she should have the common sense to at least ask if it\u2019s okay to bring the kids, and turn down the invite when you say no. The only time I assume my kids can go with me somewhere is with my sister, who also has a child and our plans together pretty much always include the kids anyway.

For people with no kids you generally assume when you invite someone for lunch, brunch or dinner you\u2019re talking about the adults. I went to a lot of dinner parties at my friends places in NYC and I think we would all be confused if someone showed up with kids (even if we knew they had kids).

When the child is there, we definitely have to watch our conversation... but the thing is, we treat the little girl well, we find out what she might like to eat, converse with her. Her mother usually brings stuff to keep her occupied but we also will provide something for her if we have it. She has been to almost all our homes except for the one who has grandchildren (probably the only one who's home is childproof). My home is not childproof but her mother is there as well as all of us and she does just fine.  If she was a baby, we would be passing her around, taking turns holding her before letting her nap in her infant chair. I just don't know why or how other grown adult women who are all neighbors couldn't figure out a work around during a lunch get together. It isn't even halfway hard to do. Turning someone away at the door is just so cold and rude. Most small children won't eat salmon and quinoa... she may have already fed them or had sandwiches in her bag with some cheerios.", "I didn\u2019t write y t a, I wrote esh because OP has contributed to their own conflict and doesn\u2019t seem to realize it.", "I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s an AH for withdrawing, I\u2019m saying she\u2019s contributed to the conflict she\u2019s experiencing.", "You're right in that no one is required to be friends with her, but it doesn't mean they have to be rude about it either. OP brushed off this woman's attempt at friendship after realizing her kids would always be involved, but declined to inform this poor woman of that. Put yourself in the mom's shoes, probably desperate to make an adult friend, in a new neighborhood, then she sees the women she's been trying to befriend out walking without her and inquires as to why she wasn't invited just to be told her children are a burden. There was nicer ways that OP could have handled this.\n\nAlso the whole \"she chose to have kids so she asked for it\" BS is just ridiculous. A person is still a person and subject to feelings, emotions, wants, and needs, even with children. And you don't know if she chose to get pregnant so close together either, you never know someone's story, best not to assume.", "Lmao it seems everyone is overlooking the fact that OPs house isnt childproof. If the kids got injured, then it would be another problem. If the kids BROKE something, mommy dearest most likely won't pay for shit.", "Especially to a SAHM. OP should look at it this way--- inviting a nanny for a walk during her work hours, she's going to bring the kids. Just because Molly is their mom and doesn't get a paycheck doesn't change that dynamic---daytime hours are her work hours, and she will have her children.", "It wouldn't kill her but it would make her life unnecessary Harder, just because her neighbor decided to have 4 kids with a man who is barely home and also to move into a village.\n\nIt was her choice, so no, this isn't OPs Problem and she doesn't need to me more then polite. She doesn't need to invite her for the group activities.\n\nAnd also: who the fuck give the own child someone who they met 2 times?", "It's the green light for pedestrians to cross the street. In the UK it's often shaped like a man walking. People ignore it if there are no cars but you generally wait anyway if kids are there to set a good example. \n\nSide fact: the green man in the UK is also a sort of pagan god , associated with life/nature and found on many churches here.", ">FYSA.\n\nWhat does the Florida Youth Soccer Association have to do with this?", "I'm in the same situation. I would never assume my child is invited especially if the other people don't have children. I would just say that I'd like to come but I don't have anyone to watch my daughter. That leaves it open for them to say \"That's too bad.\" Or to invite my daughter. There's things I have to miss out on sometimes. I knew that before I became a parent and accepted it. I chose to be a SAHM.", "Same here. No family and I had moved to a new area, so I didn\u2019t have a babysitter yet. I do think ESH. I have teens now, but when they were young, I would always ask if my kids are coming or should I hire a sitter. Most of my friends have kids so it was kids invited. But my neighbors do not. So I would always ask. \n\nI do wonder the tone of OP when she spoke to her. It may have set off the neighbor. Also, maybe suggest a Mother\u2019s Day out at a nearby church or Rec center. The MDO was the first step in my weekly freedom. Nope, I\u2019m not religious, but I didn\u2019t care. Those 3 hours each week was worth my sanity. Cannot imagine 4 kids, and yes, she did choose to have them, but it\u2019s gotta still be tough.", "My mom became a stay at home mom because after her first child and paying for daycare should would have made $10 for the week. It just didn\u2019t make sense to not stay with your kid for 10 bucks. Fortunately my Dad made enough that this could be a reality.", "In a group where no one has kids, why would anyone assume that her kids are invited? That is not the status quo so NTA. Also, I think it\u2019s always a bit rude to assume an invitation. If someone invites me to an event, it\u2019s not like I automatically assume my husband is being invited and take him along. \n\nThe whole \u201cvillage\u201d thing is really none of your problem lol. She chose to have the kids; you had no role in that. She has the right to feel overwhelmed and want help, but is definitely not entitled to it. I have kids and certainly don\u2019t feel like people owe it to me to take care of them (other than my husband lol).", "According to OP they're having a block party and not inviting Molly. Because one of OP's friends just happens to be the neighborhood gossip and told everyone what happened(op's version at least)", "Especially being new to the neighborhood. It takes a bit to find a sitter in a new place.", "A baby, sure. Four kids? Hell no that would ever be assumed, lmao.", "She knew she was gonna bring them and set the poor girl up to fail", "\u201cI just don\u2019t know why or how other grown adult *women*\u2026\u201d\n\nIf this was four guys with no kids getting together to drink beer and watch the football game, and a fifth guy was invited to join them but brought a child, would you have the same reaction?  Would you expect the men to just be okay with it, take turns passing the (one) baby around, rocking it and singing lullabies while drinking and cheering and yelling at the TV?  What about FOUR *toddler/young kids*?  Or would you expect the host\u2019s non-existent wife to appear out of nowhere and offer to watch the kids since the men clearly can\u2019t do both?\n\nYour comment is sexist, just because someone is a woman doesn\u2019t mean they want to hold a baby, have ever held a baby, or want to hang out with a child\u2026. Let alone four very young ones which are a lot of work.", "The simple answer is that this was written by someone in the \u201cewwww babies are gross and women with lots of young children are bad!\u201d era of their life", "I get the vibe all these Y T A people are parents who impose their children on other people all the time.", "I don't believe OP was being rude about it. She simply didn't bother to invite her to an event she wouldn't be able to participate in anyways. \n\nYes a person with kids is also a person, I'm not saying any different. But said person with kids shouldn't be upset when people don't want to be around them due to the kids. And having the 4 kids close together is most likely her choice, the odds of it being otherwise isn't very likely. It's pretty hard to imagine her making the same mistake so frequently if it was indeed a mistake.\n\nAnd lastly even if it's not pleasant to talk about and not all people believe in it, abortion was most likely an option", "Exactly", "As a mom of only one well-behaved little one I would still never assume I could bring her anywhere, especially not to a child free home.

It is shocking, and then people wonder why so many people aren\u2019t having kids! Who can afford them? I have one, I\u2019m lucky that I can stay home with her and her grandparents are nearby to watch her too.

That's not gonna be a realistic option for most.", "She shouldn't have assumed it, but it's an *understandable* assumption. It varies by region and social circle. Around here, you would most definitely specify 'no kids' on an invite to lunch at the neighbor's.", "Right? I'm childfree by choice and this neighbourhood sounds fucking rad!", "Oh God so glad to read this. I have a kid, he's grown (24), and I cannot stand to be around children anymore.  Honestly, I couldn't stand most kids when he was little (a few like my niece and our friends' kids were fine) and I despised having to do the nursery/elementary school birthday parties. I'm an only child and so is my son,  and it's the noise, screeching, running wild shit that bothers me when you have too many of them together. Went to dinner at a sushi bar just a couple of nights ago with a friend, and Jesus Christ, the screeching kids made me almost get up and leave.", "Yes. I reared my three children on my own and I wouldn\u2019t have presumed a lunch invitation included my children unless they were specifically included, which is why I also said it was rude.", "As opposed to a non-situational awareness?

If I happen to be invited to something on a day where I don't have childcare, I always make it a point to inform people that if I join I would have to bring my kid, and offer to reschedule for another day when I would have childcare.
