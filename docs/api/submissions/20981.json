A couple in their late twenties with four small children. The wife is a SAHM and the husband is a trucker. I went to introduce myself and bring them a pie right after they moved in. I didn\u2019t really like their vibe but I\u2019m a friendly person so I tried inviting the wife to things. \n\nOur neighborhood is small, a collection of ten houses. Everyone knows everyone and is generally pretty friendly. No one else has young kids though. It\u2019s mostly couples with no kids, or older couples who\u2019s kids moved out. I hang out with two of my female neighbors who are a similar age to my own (mid twenties). We go on walks, have lunch at each others houses, etc. I only work three days a week so I have a lot of free time. \n\nI invited the new neighbor, Molly, to two different things. Lunch at my house and also a walk/hike me and the others were going on. Both time she just assumed she could bring her kids and showed up to my house with them. I turned her away from lunch at my house because I don\u2019t want four rowdy kids under the age of six in my not childproof house. She was upset because she has no one who can ever watch them, and she can\u2019t come without them. She did bring them on a walk with us but we couldn\u2019t go in the forest because of her stroller so it kind of ruined things for us. There\u2019s no trees or shade in the neighborhood and the summer heat makes it awful, the forest is much better.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been avoiding Molly like the plague, I just don\u2019t want to be her friend. She\u2019s invited me over, asked to come over and bring her kids, she even asked me to watch her kids the other day so she can have a break. I barely know the woman and I feel like her behavior is pretty inappropriate and she\u2019s maybe just not picking up on social cues. \n\nToday me and my other neighbors went for a walk in the forest, and she saw us go. She texted me to ask why she wasn\u2019t invited, and I said it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want our plans to be altered by her children, and she\u2019s expressed that she can\u2019t do anything without her children. She went on a rant about how it takes a village and we don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, and she called us all assholes. \n\nI agree with her that I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, because I would personally never choose to have four kids with an absent husband. I just feel like she\u2019s being unreasonable to expect us to have a bad time just so she can have a good time. Her kids were super annoying and hard to deal with. My husband thinks she\u2019s an asshole but my mom thinks I should be more sympathetic. \n\nAITA for excluding my neighbor from activities?", "created_utc": 1688131608, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14n0ekm/aita_for_excluding_my_new_neighbor_from_stuff_and/", "score": 362, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yes 4 kids is hard, but they're not your responsibility, and Molly's wellbeing isn't as well.", "NTA. You gave her a chance; she wasn't interested enough to make arrangements for her kids.

And she\u2019s not required to be Molly\u2019s BFF.\n\nMolly, as soon as she realized none of the neighbors had children and didn\u2019t do kid friendly activities, should have pivoted and (a) asked if kids were welcome at these invitations, and (b) upon realizing this wasn\u2019t a kid friendly group, started looking for a friend group that was (playgrounds, library, etc).

I have kids and wouldn't presume I can bring my kids to outings with friends who don't have kids unless they explicitly invite me. It means I can't join a lot of outings but that's literally my problem.", "The Y ta votes are blowing my mind. If someone invites you to their house or an activity or something you can\u2019t just bring as many other people as you want. Op invited one person to lunch. Molly brought five people total and expected op to accommodate her. What if op didn\u2019t have enough food to feed an extra four people?

She is acting like she\u2019s entitled to ur time and company but she isn\u2019t, being a neighbor doesn\u2019t equal having to be friends.  Idk why people are being ridiculous, they\u2019re trying to get you to be friends with a person that you do not enjoy being around, you and ur friends in the neighborhood had a schedule and just because she moved in that doesn\u2019t mean your life\u2019s now have to shift to accommodate her.

Don\u2019t have the kids if you can\u2019t take care of them without having to foist them off on others. She needs to get friends outside her neighborhood who actually have things in common such as children of similar ages, play groups, etc. When my kids were small I lived where everyone around had grown children. My kids learned to be their own play group and got my breaks from them once they were all in school.", "BLUF: Both you are assholes \n\nYou: Now, you clearly saw that the woman had 4 young kids and the husband is a truck driver. When you invite her to go places where tf else would the kids be? Come on now. \n\nMolly: she wasn\u2019t an asshole until the whole watch my kids thing and it takes a village. That\u2019s foolish when you don\u2019t even know the people watching your kids. \n\nBack to you. That snippy shit about having kids with an absent father is stupid and unnecessary.

You both are on different paths in life and that\u2019s okay.", "NTA, her choice to marry & have kids with a dude that is never around. \"It takes a village....\" is an old proverb steeped in African societies (hence the village part) where villages are more communal than here. Villagers include parents, siblings, extended family.", "This was a hard one to judge. I could see myself agreeing with ESH comments but ultimately, after reading your other comments, I'm settling on NTA. \n\nYou described your first encounter as the husband being rude and Molly asking help with the furniture. I think Molly is just in a terribly exhausting situation and is looking for all the help she can get, which is great if the neighbors are willing to help, but crosses a line if molly expects the whole neighborhood to help raise her kids. This is the vibe I'm getting from Molly through your comments. I feel like if you help her out with one measly task, she'll wiggle her way in and you'd become a permanent babysitter for Molly, especially because you said you only work 3 days a week. \n\nYou're right to be concerned about kids running around in your non baby proofed house, because if they did get hurt in your house, I can only imagine how Molly and her husband would react. \n\nThat being said, I think you can still try to be friendly with Molly while keeping your boundaries. If there are any kid friendly activities going on in the neighborhood, let her know. If your other neighbourhood friends want to host Molly at their house, be cordial. But be wary of any future babysitting requests.", "NTA for not inviting her on things you don't consider child-friendly. You still could be her friend though and socialize with her on other occasions, if you like her otherwise.", "NTA. I don't have children, but a lot of my friends do. We sometimes do things that aren't suitable for children and they either leave them behind or miss those events. Much like I take a pass on bounce house parties with 30 kids. It's  a lot harder for balance when only one person has kids. I wouldn't change my girlfriend time just due to one person I didn't really vibe with. But maybe you could throw her a bone occasionally.", "NTA your neighbour needed to ask \"is it OK to bring my kids?\" each time. You do come across a little judgemental here though.", "NTA. Molly sounds entitled as shit.", "NTA. I h\u00e2te that whole it takes a village bullshit. If you choose to have kids that\u2019s on you.

Not your kids, not your problem.  Your neighbour needs to build up some cred before asking for favours and free childcare. I get her frustration, but that is nothing to do with you.\n\nBut still, you are neighbours. It always pays to be cordial. Bake another pie for the kids? Maybe set up a time where you can do some outdoorsy stuff, but in her/your back yard? Keeps the little darlings out of your house and gives your neighbour a bit of \"adult time\". She probably misses having an adult to talk to. Yes, her approach was poor, but don't hold it against her. Hell, her kids might be paying the taxes that pay for YOUR Social Security some day!", "NTA.

But the way you speak down about her is absolutely insufferable.

I feel bad for her but if your all pretty much child free why would you change your life around for a new friend with kids", "YTA. You turned someone away after inviting them to your home without specifying they weren\u2019t allowed to bring their children. You knew she was a SAHM so where else would her kids be during the day while her husband is working? I feel so sorry for your neighbour. It\u2019s hard not having support and then she would have thought she was getting support from you only to be pushed away repeatedly - how isolating for her. It\u2019s fine to not to like kids or want to be around then but you should have lead with that so she knew what kind of relationship you were looking for before she made the effort to organise herself and bring her kids out.", "Esh. Her for the village thing, but man. You started it. You knew she was home with those kids, when you invited her to lunch and on a walk, where did you think she was going to stow them? If the kids weren\u2019t invited too, you should have let her know up front. I bet she felt you did it purposely, to show her she didn\u2019t fit in your neighborhood, and honestly; I\u2019m not sure you didn\u2019t.", "Nah. It doesn\u2019t take much to be kind to a tired, isolated mom. You don\u2019t have to invite her on your walks or to your house but you don\u2019t have to be so mean.

He\u2019s at work. There is a difference.

It\u2019s definitely not safe. I would not just have shown up at a near strangers house with four little kids without asking the person about bringing them or instead asking if they could come to my house because it\u2019s childproofed.\n\nIf someone had invited me on a walk and I knew I had to bring my kids, I would ask things like how far are we going and where, because I had four kids.\n\nAnd I would never ask a child free person to watch my four little kids unless it was a very good friend or relative who knew them, knew what they were like and what it took to take care of them.\n\nIt\u2019s just a level of chaos and the need for constant attention to four tiny people that you have to get used to doing and have a tremendous amount of energy to handle.\n\nI see women out in public with their own big group of little kids, and I want to tell them their lives don\u2019t have to be this difficult, that they don\u2019t have to follow some religious BS or misogynistic idea that a woman needs to have kid after kid after kid. They always look exhausted and so stressed.\n\nSo I feel bad for that mom, but she\u2019s not entitled to  have other people help her with her kids. She made her choices.

Sure she has a big family but i don't think she was prepared for how lonely the burden would be. She would **love** nothing more than a caring community and set of friends to support her. Just unfortunate that your community may not be the right demographic. She has NO choice but be shackled to her children, and you're obviously avoiding her because of it.

Libraries usually have story/craft times for kids where she can meet other parents. Visit the local parks and recreation office and get info on summer camps and other activities for children. Some places like the zoo have free admission days. Everything she does should involve meeting other parents with kids. She should also invite the neighborhood ladies over for coffee or lunch and not wait for them to do the inviting all the time. \nBut, OP, you turned her away at the door after inviting her for lunch?

I know how incredibly isolating it is being a mom and I only have one kid. She probably felt like you were giving her a lifeline to something outside her new home and her kids. But then you ripped it away and now she\u2019s drowning in loneliness again. I get that she\u2019s mad but I get you too. No one is forced to be friends with anyone they don\u2019t want to.

You know that she is a SAHM and her husband is often absent. You should have put two and two together and at least asked her what her plan was for the kids at lunch. It\u2019s also pretty rude to literally turn her away at the door because she brought the kids when you had not previously informed her that you don\u2019t allow children in your home. \n\nShe\u2019s also not behaving very kindly to you, and the \u201cit takes a village\u201d comment was inappropriate.

You assumed she would know that her children weren\u2019t invited and she assumed that you\u2019d know she is home alone with them all day and therefore had no choice but to bring them.

There is plenty of middle ground between changing up your established routines in order to accommodate her and pretending she doesn\u2019t exist.

A couple in their late twenties with four small children. The wife is a SAHM and the husband is a trucker. I went to introduce myself and bring them a pie right after they moved in. I didn\u2019t really like their vibe but I\u2019m a friendly person so I tried inviting the wife to things. \n\nOur neighborhood is small, a collection of ten houses. Everyone knows everyone and is generally pretty friendly. No one else has young kids though. It\u2019s mostly couples with no kids, or older couples who\u2019s kids moved out. I hang out with two of my female neighbors who are a similar age to my own (mid twenties). We go on walks, have lunch at each others houses, etc. I only work three days a week so I have a lot of free time. \n\nI invited the new neighbor, Molly, to two different things. Lunch at my house and also a walk/hike me and the others were going on. Both time she just assumed she could bring her kids and showed up to my house with them. I turned her away from lunch at my house because I don\u2019t want four rowdy kids under the age of six in my not childproof house. She was upset because she has no one who can ever watch them, and she can\u2019t come without them. She did bring them on a walk with us but we couldn\u2019t go in the forest because of her stroller so it kind of ruined things for us. There\u2019s no trees or shade in the neighborhood and the summer heat makes it awful, the forest is much better.\n\nSince then I\u2019ve been avoiding Molly like the plague, I just don\u2019t want to be her friend. She\u2019s invited me over, asked to come over and bring her kids, she even asked me to watch her kids the other day so she can have a break. I barely know the woman and I feel like her behavior is pretty inappropriate and she\u2019s maybe just not picking up on social cues. \n\nToday me and my other neighbors went for a walk in the forest, and she saw us go. She texted me to ask why she wasn\u2019t invited, and I said it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want our plans to be altered by her children, and she\u2019s expressed that she can\u2019t do anything without her children. She went on a rant about how it takes a village and we don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, and she called us all assholes. \n\nI agree with her that I don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like, because I would personally never choose to have four kids with an absent husband. I just feel like she\u2019s being unreasonable to expect us to have a bad time just so she can have a good time. Her kids were super annoying and hard to deal with.

You and Molly obviously don\u2019t have enough in common to be friends. Just living in the same neighborhood doesn\u2019t mean you are obligated to buddy up with her. And I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to have to include her kids in your outings with your friends. I have nothing at all against mothers or children. On the contrary, I love little children (when they\u2019re not brats), and I raised two kids of my own. \n\nBut at this point in my life, I absolutely do not want to hang out with kids, especially badly behaved ones. I don\u2019t want them in my non-childproofed house, I don\u2019t want to have to adjust my plans to accommodate kids. I definitely don\u2019t want to go to specifically child friendly events or places, because I do not want to deal with the noise, etc. and the chance that there will be AH parents there who think it\u2019s fine to let their kids run wild and disrupt other people\u2019s relaxation and enjoyment.\n\nIf she wants or needs to take her kids with her wherever she goes, that\u2019s fine, but it means there are some things she won\u2019t be able to do. Hanging out with a group of childless young people is one of those things. Lunch at someone\u2019s home that is not childproofed or safe for uncontrolled little kids is one of those things. A hike on a trail that can\u2019t accommodate her stroller is one of those things. \n\nIf she wants to hang out, why doesn\u2019t *she* plan to do something fun that can include her kids and invite you to join in? That would be a much better way to make friends with the neighbors than acting entitled to join you in your plans and being a total AH when she isn\u2019t invited.", "NTA. Her kids aren't your problem and there's nothing forcing you to be her friend. She and her husband made the choice to have kids and unfortunately, they moved into a neighborhood where most families don't have kids.\n\nCould you be more sympathetic? Sure. But that doesn't mean you need to be. It's not your job to alter your plans or desires unless you want to.", "Nta. I have kids, they're teens now, but I remember the young days. She needs to find some mom friends, other moms with kids her own age. That's her village she wants/needs.", "NTA, I live in a small neighborhood. Your new neighbor is being pretty rude in this situation, just because she has kids doesn\u2019t mean you have to hangout with them.", "Agreed, although there's a little bit of AH on all sides for not being clear, and reacting strongly when they realized there was a misunderstanding. Everyone could have been a little more graceful in their responses. Outside of that, NAH.\n\nOn a side note, it's odd that the new neighbor didn't research the area better. I know the market isn't great so it's not always a choice, but if I had kids I'd look to move to an area where they might make friends on their street, especially if my spouse was going to be away as often as Molly's. But too late for that here.", ">(a) asked if kids were welcome at these invitations\n\nHow is she not the asshole for not doing so, assuming that an invite to her is an invite to her and her kids, and as per OPs edit, completely taking over their walk and changing it in a wah that nobody wanted.", "I made salmon and quinoa for lunch anyways.

OP and the neighbor are in different stages of life and that is ok. OP doesn\u2019t have to befriend someone she doesn\u2019t have much, if anything, in common with. \nThe neighbor was rude to assume her kids were included in the invitation. She should have asked for clarification on that. It makes sense that OP, not having children, would not have expected them to come *especially* if they are noisy and rowdy, as I expect kids under age ten to be. \nOP was neighborly, in bringing the pie. And she made an effort at being friendly. It didn\u2019t work out. She is not obligated to her neighbor in any way to provide friendship and certainly not childcare. \nBeing a single parent of three children with an absentee father I can absolutely sympathize with the neighbor for wanting friends and wanting a break, but she needs to work that out on her own.", "I believe the judgement you're looking for is ESH: Everyone Sucks Here.

Sometimes folks can have a myopic view that focuses being right over being kind.\n\nThere's no downside to making amends at least to the extent that things are cordial moving forwards. If she oversteps, establish your boundaries. \n\nIt sounds like Molly is pretty stressed out and reacted out of pain. Doesn't make her reaction right, but it is an understandable, human response to being excluded. It sounds like she did try to reach out and invite you over so the kids wouldn't be running amok at someone else's home. Saying no to babysitting is fair game,  but rejecting that olive branch was a mean girls move.\n\nLong term, less stressful to have a decent relationship with neighbors especially when all it'll likely take is some brief communication on your end. Doesn't mean you have to be best friends, but it wouldn't kill you to sit and have a chat with her.

Good sitters that will watch that many are also not cheap. She probably can't afford it, which means she doesn't get that much time to go do fun things with other people her age. I get that having that many kids is a choice, but your attitude towards it is extremely judgmental.
