No excuse for getting mad at a baby. That said- it can be really hard when your friend has a baby, things change. You are both pretty young- is it possible maybe your friend is feeling like your friendship is neglected? 20s are a challenging time in life because some people are at the club while others have babies. I have a few friends myself who had babies and that\u2019s either all they talk about or they don\u2019t ever hang out 1:1 and always bring the children. It does change the dynamic.

We said \"semi-formal\" which we hoped most people would interpret as \"dress up and look nice, but don't stress about it.\" As a guest, it's nice to have some expectations about how you should try to dress. It's not great to have to buy something brand new when you're financially stressed already. And sometimes you have to travel and/or pay for accommodations already too.

My wife and I eloped, and one of many reasons we did this was that we didn't want to financially impose on anyone.

Brooke Shields sent gossip rags wild by buying a white wedding dress to wear to it. The stunning Cher showed up in red with ostrich feathers.", "\nThere is ALWAYS going to be some kind of dress code for a wedding. It may be a prescribed degree of formality, a color scheme or a theme.\n\nI find it an honor to be included when people I love join together for a lifetime! If I am ever invited to an event (including a wedding) and the planned festivities are not to my taste, I have options, including staying home, but deriding a couple\u2019s choices for their ceremony using pejorative language is NOT one I\u2019d choose!", "Everyone has the option to send a heartfelt letter (or gift) and STAY HOME if the arrangements don\u2019t suit you. \n\nYou may not know the reason for a color choice. It may have NOTHING to do w/ IG or entitlement. Mb the couple selected a color palette tied to when they met (ex. pastels for Spring or red, green or black for a Christmas wedding.)  Maybe they requested guests wear black and white bc the bride will wear red as is the custom in some Asian cultures. Maybe they want everyone is black bc they are mourning the loss of the bride\u2019s recently deceased sibling or parents. YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING! \n\nThe reason does not matter anyway. If a guest can\u2019t honor the couple\u2019s request request w/ an open heart and w/out using mean-spirited language like tacky or entitled- STAY HOME!! \n\nIF it is TRULY a financial strain, options include sending 1 person to represent a larger family or putting together a lovely no/low cost gift. Ex. Use IG/FB to solicit the couple\u2019s nearest and dearest for fave recipes AND \u201cingredients for a great marriage.\u201dHave the collection made into a book using Shutterfly OR handwrite it into a journal. Explain w/ a heartfelt letter. Instant beloved treasure."]}
