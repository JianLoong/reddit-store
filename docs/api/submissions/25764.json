Let alone that they would both be dark...", "That's what I'm wondering. She has a 7 month old, brought extra clothes, why couldn't they be dark?", "Probably because most baby girl clothes aren\u2019t dark colors unless they\u2019re for fall or winter.  She probably bought one special outfit for the wedding, but I can\u2019t honestly blame her for not buying two.", "Because she then needed to BUY not one but 2 festive dark dresses. Probably a colour that she usually doesn\u2019t buy for her daughter.\nIt is really hard to get dark colors for small kids when it\u2019s winter, let alone now..\nWhy would she need to spend more money on an outfit that is hard to get and won\u2019t be used again bye the child?\nNowadays brides take their \u201cvisions\u201d way too seriously. Demanding people wear stuff they won\u2019t wear again or don\u2019t like at all.\nThe whole don\u2019t wear white thing I understand.\nBut getting angry that a baby doesn\u2019t have multiple dark colored festive dresses is just stupid.", "I understand the sentiment here but I recently had to go to a funeral with my 2 year old and honestly we hit about 6 different stores before we found dark clothes (that didn\u2019t have other things like characters, words, etc) on them.

So any backups would be lighter colors. And she said this was a darker pink color.", "Agree.  First grandchild recently born, so have spent a lot of time recently in baby clothing stores.  Finding one special outfit in a dark color for a 7 month girl would be hard enough, but given the cost of nice baby clothes, it\u2019s just crazy to buy two outfits.", "In the future if you are in a bind JOAnns crafts has a wide selection of plain t shirts in all colors (including black) in children\u2019s sizes.", "I say ESH because I\u2019m a parent and I remember what it was like to need 3-5 outfits just for a simple outing when my kid was a baby.\n\nYou feel your own way, that\u2019s cool.

This reminds me of my own wedding. I bought identical dresses for my sweet god daughters age 2 and 4. The 2 year old one had an accident on the way to our reception venue I think she vomited. Her mum changed her into another dress. I felt so bad at her own distress never cared about the dress. What kind of person throws hateful comments towards a 7 months old?", "Your friend is the AH. It's a baby!", "She\u2019s not your friend. She secretly hates you. Because WHAT?", "You and your daughter should be crucified.", "NTA  if the bride is so mad that your seven month old daughter is going to steal her thunder at her wedding then it really would not matter what your daughters wearing, I'm quite certain that your baby is far more beautiful and has a much sweeter temperament than the bride so she has no chance against your baby even if she was wearing just her nappy/diaper and a burlap sack! If all the guests are going to be enthralled by your daughter in a pink dress and not the bride, it's not the dress causing it, I hope your little one looked absolutely beautiful and got everyone's attention all day.

First, dark clothes for children(especially this young) are almost impossible to find. Secondly, the bride must be a psychopath, and took her idea of a perfect wedding aesthetic (and insecurities) way too far, because who tf dictates how the guests have to dress???

If I ever get married, I plan to throw a shindig in my backyard. Come in your pjs for all I care! People are there to see the bride and groom get married, they don't give two f's about what the other guests are wearing (unless it's super inappropriate of course). \n\nTo throw a tantrum over what a 7 month old baby is wearing is RIDICULOUS.", "This would make sense if she didn't had another dress at her to change the baby into. But obviously she in fact did predict the future by packing an extra dress - so the question is valid why she didn't just packed a dark extra dress when she packed the baby bag.", "Because she ruined this beautiful bride's wedding day and tainted her daughter along with her.

Your friend is off the meat rack.", "Honestly - and this is the hill I am willing to die on - anyone who enforces a dress code because otherwise their perfect day won't be perfect is an asshole.

The rule (\"no light colours, no exceptions\") isn't unreasonable; it leaves literally half of all colours available. Yet you chose to break it anyway.

That\u2019s like totally gross! You absolutely did not do anything wrong! If she can\u2019t understand that you young child hand an accident and HAD no other choice.

That must have been one hell of a tiny pink dress!\n\nAlso, a few days ago it was August!  Unless you're in the southern hemisphere and it's winter, it's been hideously hot all across North America, Europe, and parts of Asia.

I mean, would the bride really rather have had her in soiled clothes? I guess poop is dark colored...", "What? Events have dress codes all the time. OP is still NTA, but saying you can't have a required dress code for a wedding is wild.", "Those are the weddings that will end in divorce rather quickly.", "My girls usually had one dress per size at that age. They usually wore romper at 7 months. This bride is nuts. A darker pink isn't even a light colour.", "I really can\u2019t imagine many 7 month olds have multiple dark, summer-appropriate dresses in their closet, can you? Unless OP dresses her daughter like Baby Darkness year round, she probably had to specially buy the first dress. I def wouldn\u2019t buy multiple dresses for a kid that age since it would almost certainly be a one-time wear before baby grows out of it.", "Maybe she was to busy raising a 7 month old baby that it was a priority to have a dark back up dress. Only a maniac would care what a baby wore as an emergency back up. The fact people are even saying this like she\u2019s doing something wrong blows my mind.", "I can\u2019t even believe you think that. Assuming you must be just like the bride.

Be grateful for the friend with a small baby is still willing to make the effort to come. \nWhen I get married, I telling my friends to dress up all the babies and kids who come as little brides and grooms. It will be adorable. Especially as they will all be about 2-3 years old and most of my friends with kids are also friends. Not sure if it makes me more of a sociopath or less! But my friend dresses her niece up in s mini wedding dress and it was adorable", "Having a dress code is one thing, that's like saying, please don't wear jeans or short pants to my wedding. \n\nSaying \"this is the approved color for my wedding, and if you don't oblige, you will ruin the most important day of my life\" means there is something wrong with you.", "Maybe because she thought that a baby that is not yet walking would be exempt from a dress code.", "Well I call it being prepared she knew where she was gonna and even made her baby wear a dark set of clothes but still her friend over reacted n should be more understanding or her friend should have just made it adults only.", "I probably wouldn't have photos because I have issues surrounding having my picture taken. But I think a pop of red in a sea of black would make for a visually striking experience, which is important to me. Black clothing--as opposed to something like puce, green chartreuse, stygian blue, or pale octarine--is not fussy and very easy to find.\n\nEvents have dress codes all the time. \"Something black that doesn't have holes in it\" isn't nearly as finicky as black tie or formal. It's essentially traditional American (and maybe elsewhere too) funeral attire but even less formal, which is pretty accessible.", "It's pretty normal for weddings to have a dresscode for guests. It's usually for candid pictures, so the guests match nicely with the 'wedding colours' for flowers etc. Also showing up to a castle wedding in ripped jeans is inappropriate most of the time, so it's helpful to let guests know what to expect.", "I liked the couple on here months ago who were requesting the kids wear their pjs to the wedding and then were planning a slumber party in an adjacent room for the kids to enjoy while the reception happened. \n\nThe kids are comfy and it didn't matter if they fell asleep before getting home (or leaving the wedding) because they were already dressed for bed.\ud83e\udd23", "That's a cute idea, but keep in mind that wedding dresses and suits for toddlers could be expensive and difficult to find and might exclude a lot of people.", "Funerals (at least in the US) have a required formality level and color.
