No excuse for getting mad at a baby. That said- it can be really hard when your friend has a baby, things change. You are both pretty young- is it possible maybe your friend is feeling like your friendship is neglected? 20s are a challenging time in life because some people are at the club while others have babies. I have a few friends myself who had babies and that\u2019s either all they talk about or they don\u2019t ever hang out 1:1 and always bring the children. It does change the dynamic. Maybe she felt like this was her special day where she is the center of attention and got triggered by the baby out of jealousy for seeing less of you lately. Again not excusing her behavior, I would just question if something deeper is at play here (if you want to continue the friendship).", "I feel like everyone has missed the most important point.

So I am also wondering why the backup packed wasn\u2019t a dark colour too. Did she forget to communicate to her husband? Did her husband forget? Or did they not have any other dark coloured dress?\n\nTbh, I do think it was a bit much for the bride to insist on the dress code for a baby who had a perfectly natural accident, but I would like to know if it was hard for OP to accommodate the dark colour dress code for the backup too.", "if someone confuses your baby for the bride baby is AH ( I kid )", "Nope, they don't get any SNAP funds either, that all went to Brett Farve.", "I don't know. It feels presumptuous and entitled to tell other people which color to wear, and ask them to spend money on something they perhaps won't even like or wear ever again. \n\nI mean, if the color pallet is that important to some people on the day when they are starting a new important chapter in their lives, then I guess I would say those people are pretty shallow and self-absorbed.", "I hadn't even heard of this.

Just stay home and don\u2019t bring this energy to someone\u2019s else big day.", "Or the bride can be considerate of her guests to make sure people want to go to her wedding.", "Uhm no, the couple can dictate whatever dress code they want cause it\u2019s their wedding day, they are paying for this big expensive party and if it\u2019s too much effort for you to respect the dress code you can just stay home. I can\u2019t imagine getting so butthurt over such a simple dress code as \u201cwear anything black\u201d. This is literally the simplest dress code ever. \n\nI work as a wedding photographer and in my country it is extremely common to have a dress code for a wedding, and total black is one of the most popular dress codes in recent years. Guests who don\u2019t respect the dress code always look out of place because the majority of people happily follow the dress code with no complaints."]}
