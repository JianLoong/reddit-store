I tend to be pretty pro bride on this sub. I think it's fine for brides to pick their party's outfits, the parent outfits, etc.  But making a dress code for the entire audience!?

First of all, your baby was only wearing a light color because the accident left no other choice. Second, if you are trying to impose dress codes like this on a literal infant, you\u2019re an absolute sociopath.", "Nta.  She got mad at a baby. Lol.", "NTA.  Your friend is one though with a freaking dress code for guests, especially for a seven month old baby.", "NTA. No one should be concerned about what a baby is wearing.", "NTA.

Yes, she was being a brat, but you knew from the beginning that she was very serious about the wedding", "NTA as ur friends sounds like manipulative maniac who wants everything to be about herself after she got engaged but also why didn\u2019t u prepare another dark coloured clothes?

We don't always remember to pre-pack appropriate clothes. I know our diaper bag always had the same sort of clothes in them in case of accidents. We never pre-packed special event extras. We never even thought of it.", "Because she probably has 20,000 details to manage in every day life and can't predict the future.", "I'm already surprised a 7 month old has not one but two nice dresses! Let alone that they would both be dark...", "That's what I'm wondering. She has a 7 month old, brought extra clothes, why couldn't they be dark?", "Probably because most baby girl clothes aren\u2019t dark colors unless they\u2019re for fall or winter.  She probably bought one special outfit for the wedding, but I can\u2019t honestly blame her for not buying two.", "Because she then needed to BUY not one but 2 festive dark dresses. Probably a colour that she usually doesn\u2019t buy for her daughter.\nIt is really hard to get dark colors for small kids when it\u2019s winter, let alone now..\nWhy would she need to spend more money on an outfit that is hard to get and won\u2019t be used again bye the child?\nNowadays brides take their \u201cvisions\u201d way too seriously. Demanding people wear stuff they won\u2019t wear again or don\u2019t like at all.\nThe whole don\u2019t wear white thing I understand.\nBut getting angry that a baby doesn\u2019t have multiple dark colored festive dresses is just stupid.", "I understand the sentiment here but I recently had to go to a funeral with my 2 year old and honestly we hit about 6 different stores before we found dark clothes (that didn\u2019t have other things like characters, words, etc) on them. It was harder than I thought it would be. I mean we would have settled for a plain black shirt but it was brightly coloured everything for kids. \n\nJust pointing that out.", "So she needed to buy 2 new outfits for a baby in a color she wouldn\u2019t usually buy?\nNah.. the bride can ask. But not dictate what people wear.\nNowadays brides just take their \u201cvisions\u201d way too far.", "I understand she can\u2019t predict the future, but it seems to me that most people know with an infant or toddler there is a high likelihood of an accident happening, apparently including OP bc she had a spare just not one that was the right color.", "Yeah, I figured maybe she had to go out and buy a dark dress for the baby for the wedding. So any backups would be lighter colors. And she said this was a darker pink color.", "Agree.  First grandchild recently born, so have spent a lot of time recently in baby clothing stores.  Finding one special outfit in a dark color for a 7 month girl would be hard enough, but given the cost of nice baby clothes, it\u2019s just crazy to buy two outfits.", "In the future if you are in a bind JOAnns crafts has a wide selection of plain t shirts in all colors (including black) in children\u2019s sizes.", "I say ESH because I\u2019m a parent and I remember what it was like to need 3-5 outfits just for a simple outing when my kid was a baby.\n\nYou feel your own way, that\u2019s cool.  Just post it up.", "It could also be that there are already extras packed in the diaper bag and she didn\u2019t think to edit the outfits. Or maybe the baby had more than one blowout.", "NTA - I was scrolling around looking for your daughters age! Omg a 7 month old in a pink dress is not going to steal her spotlight! I\u2019m not entirely sure what she expected you to do, have multiple black baby dresses??", "NTA and this friend is an absolute control freak and needs some serious help and therapy. This reminds me of my own wedding. I bought identical dresses for my sweet god daughters age 2 and 4. The 2 year old one had an accident on the way to our reception venue I think she vomited. Her mum changed her into another dress. I felt so bad at her own distress never cared about the dress. What kind of person throws hateful comments towards a 7 months old?", "Your friend is the AH. It's a baby!", "She\u2019s not your friend. She secretly hates you. Because WHAT?", "You and your daughter should be crucified.", "NTA  if the bride is so mad that your seven month old daughter is going to steal her thunder at her wedding then it really would not matter what your daughters wearing, I'm quite certain that your baby is far more beautiful and has a much sweeter temperament than the bride so she has no chance against your baby even if she was wearing just her nappy/diaper and a burlap sack! If all the guests are going to be enthralled by your daughter in a pink dress and not the bride, it's not the dress causing it, I hope your little one looked absolutely beautiful and got everyone's attention all day. Bride is sociopathic and needs to chill lol  :)", "NTA... your friend has issues.  You abided by her... silly strict dress code, but infants have accidents and she had to be changed.\n\nOur wedding was child free, my cousin showed up with his newborn infant, you know what we said \"He is such a cute baby\" because he was an infant!", "INFO what\u2019s an \u201caccident\u201d for a 7 month old? You weren\u2019t expecting her to potty?", "It's a freaking baby. Imagine thinking a baby outshines you. Girl needs therapy. Nta.", "Dark clothes for a 7 months old?? They are very difficult to find, and no one uses them. The OP probably already had  to buy a new dress for the child, but buying 2??? And in a dark colour? I think the OP was already VERY kind in making their 7 months old(!!!) child follow the \"outfit rules\".", "Easy? First, dark clothes for children(especially this young) are almost impossible to find. Secondly, the bride must be a psychopath, and took her idea of a perfect wedding aesthetic (and insecurities) way too far, because who tf dictates how the guests have to dress??? And lastly, even if she had found 2 dark coloured dresses, why would she had to buy 2 dresses in a colour that no one uses for a child of that age just to follow the instructions of a control freak?", "\ud83d\udc80 why?", "I hate being the center of attention. If I ever get married, I plan to throw a shindig in my backyard. Come in your pjs for all I care! People are there to see the bride and groom get married, they don't give two f's about what the other guests are wearing (unless it's super inappropriate of course). \n\nTo throw a tantrum over what a 7 month old baby is wearing is RIDICULOUS.", "This would make sense if she didn't had another dress at her to change the baby into. But obviously she in fact did predict the future by packing an extra dress - so the question is valid why she didn't just packed a dark extra dress when she packed the baby bag.", "Because she ruined this beautiful bride's wedding day and tainted her daughter along with her. Only the cleansing flames of hell will purify them.", "Lmao, you either are joking, or are a psychopath"]}
