No excuse for getting mad at a baby. That said- it can be really hard when your friend has a baby, things change. You are both pretty young- is it possible maybe your friend is feeling like your friendship is neglected? 20s are a challenging time in life because some people are at the club while others have babies. I have a few friends myself who had babies and that\u2019s either all they talk about or they don\u2019t ever hang out 1:1 and always bring the children. It does change the dynamic. Maybe she felt like this was her special day where she is the center of attention and got triggered by the baby out of jealousy for seeing less of you lately. Again not excusing her behavior, I would just question if something deeper is at play here (if you want to continue the friendship).", "I feel like everyone has missed the most important point.

But those are great suggestions for others who might be looking.", "I am not even dating anyone or looking to. \ud83d\ude02", "I'm a nonpracticing goth, but I don't associate black only with goths or funerals. Even if it does look like a funeral, it'll be a stunning and joyful one.", "I can just imagine them greeting people and seeing this family and saying \"wow you all look great! *looks down at the baby* except you, you are vile and you are uninvited. Rest of you, welcome!\" Can't even cut some slack for an accident, smh.", "I always keep some extra kids clothes in my car for my toddler. For a baby I kept even more. She probably just had an extra outfit in the car that she always keeps.", "As others said, often the extra clothes just live in the diaper bag until needed. I\u2019m lucky if mine aren\u2019t a size she\u2019s just outgrown, much less matching a level of formality and a color code for a specific event.", "Thank you for the tip but I\u2019m in Canada. But I\u2019ll drop by my nearest crafts store next time thanks!", "Oh, SNAP.", "\u201cCome to my wedding where we shall mourn the demise of my single life\u201d\n\nI love it", "Dress code yes, color palette no. Not really \"pretty normal\" for most events", "No, it\u2019s not normal to dictate colors for dress. Having a basic dress code like \u201cblack tie\u201d is one thing, but this idea that everything has to be choreographed down to the guest\u2019s colors is out of hand. It\u2019s possible to have a beautiful wedding with everyone wearing whatever colors they want.", "I have never heard of such a thing. It reeks of humongous egos and nothing to do with love and sharing with the people you love.", "There is a big difference between having a dress code and dictating colors", "I really appreciate your response! If I ever get married again, please please come in a sari/lengha \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "So real! I had a pinterest board long before the ex-husband came into the picture lol", "That wasn't meant as criticism, although I realize it came across that way. You do you. If you do ever get married I'm sure it will be a blast and a cool look!", "I agree with you. Its not that big of a deal to want the color people wear to match the theme.", "Ha! I do love the single life.", "Even if it's not normal, it's reasonable. Black tie is a  much stricter standard than just black.", "They are beautiful! It would be an honor to wear one.", "No offense taken. My attempt at humor just didn't come through.", "No, it\u2019s not reasonable. Many people go to weddings and wear what\u2019s in their closet. For many, it\u2019s a financial burden to have to go out and buy an outfit they may never wear again, especially if it\u2019s in a color they don\u2019t like or not look good in. Brides these days have gotten so selfish in the name of Instagram that they fail to recognize the burdens they place on their guests.", "I'd bet more people have something black in their closet than something black tie. I know that's true for my friends, and those are the people I'd be inviting, so that's all that matters to me.", "So asking someone go out and buy an expensive black tie outfit is fine but asking them to wear something black is a financial burden?", ">who doesn't have black clothes? if you don't and can't buy or borrow a black outfit just don't come i guess. but a dress code to go with the theme isn't crazy, especially when the theme is black and not some random color like purple or something people are less likely to own", "I completely agree!!", "Yeah I look like hell in black", "I think all of my friends would have a black outfit. But if they didn't, I'd buy them one. Easy peasy."]}
