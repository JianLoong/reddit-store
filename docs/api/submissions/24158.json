He will manage on his own and I should only cook for him if and only if I want to' I was a bit taken aback by this but we continued with this arrangement. \n\nFor the first 6 months we didn't have any problem but I got sick for a day or two and I couldn't cook so I had to ask him if he can do it. He refused and said he don't worry I will order something and he did. From that day onwards I have been occassionally nudging him to learn cooking and he has refused immediately. He has made it clear so for that last few months I have only been making dinner for myself and he has not complained about it at all. \n\nOn Sunday he proposed to me and I really wanted to say yes but I said that I will say yes only if he learns how to cook. He waited a moment and said \"I guess that's a no\" and went to the living room I followed him and we had the following conversation\n\nMe: it's not a no, I am sorry but it's just about the food, I am not sure how long you can stay without learning to cook.\n\nHim: it's okay, you don't need to apologise, and I have lived so long without learning it, I think I can manage.\n\nMe: are you really adamant about not learning it? Even I said I don't want to be with someone who doesn't cook atleast something basic.\n\nHim: I am not learning it. And if you feel so strong about it then I guess we are not a good match.\n\n\nWe broke up and I moved out.it was a calm discussion but I was a lot emotional and upset because we have spent last 5 years together and he was so unwilling to learn.\n\nYesterday his mom called me to check on me and we talked and she said she understands my point of view but she thinks I am wrong to add a condition like that. I should have said no to his proposal. \n\nI am devastated and I really miss him apart from this one issue we had never had any differences.

He\u2019s childish for whatever his hang up with cooking is, but he was honest and up front about it.  You\u2019ve dragged this relationship on for 1.5 years when you knew this was a big issue for you.", "INFO: what does he eat now then, if you\u2019re not cooking for him and he refuses to? Does he just have cereal for dinner or does he order takeaway every night? If it\u2019s the takeaway thing I can see how that might be an expensive lifestyle to maintain if you\u2019re eventually going to join your finances", "Yeah, YTA. Adding a condition to a proposal? You had to know that wasn't going to fly. \n\nLook, he told you he doesn't cook. You thought you could get him to, but you couldn't, so you try to make it a condition of marrying him? His mom is right, you should've just declined.", "NTA He'd rather leave a 5 year relationship than learn to cook??? That's insane for me.", "NTA, no, if this is a deal breaker for you. I hate cooking but have a deal with my significant one, he always cooks and I always clean. It works for us, he loves to cook and I have no objection to cleaning.\nMaybe you can find a compromise?", "Most outsiders (including me) will think this is a really weird place to end up, but, weirdness aside and taking your situation as presented .... NTA.  You were both clear about your position, now you just have to accept the consequences of the condition you imposed, just as he appears to accept the consequences of his position.", "YTA. Him not cooking means you have to break up? I knew some men who loved to cook. I know MANY who do not. Why is that such a big deal? He isn't forcing you to make him a meal everyday. If it isn't breaking his bank to eat out, I don't get why you're so pressed to force him to learn how to cook.", "Soft YTA. He was very clear upfront he didn\u2019t like to cook and had no intentions of cooking. Now, as a guy, I do honestly find that a bit ridiculous. But he was honest and didn\u2019t expect to burden you with it either.\n\nIt is okay that this would be a dealbreaker for you. But it is unfair you held onto this for five years and only brought it up when he proposed. If it was that much of an issue, it should have been brought up years ago. I think you were unfair to him for making his proposal conditional on something he was clear he was not changing.", "NTA And right condition if it is a dealbreaker for you. \n\nMy mom got married my father who have never wanted to learn how to cook and she always basically have a 3-rd child who always ask ways for dinner and if she is not there goes to cafe every day or take out. That\u2019s important", "YTA. \n\nHis stance is that he does NOT WANT to cook. While you keep talking about him LEARNING to cook. Lets say that you pressured him to LEARN to cook. It doesn't change the fact that he does not WANT to cook. \n\nBut what makes it 10 times worse is that you made it an ultimatum for accepting proposal. Way to kill of the mood.", "YTA. He\u2019s pulling his weight everywhere else. He doesn\u2019t want to cook and on the days you can\u2019t cook he orders takeout. That\u2019s a perfectly good alternative. If you were doing everything and him sitting on his arse watching I\u2019d have a different opinion but geez, you\u2019ve lost this person over such a ridiculous issue.", "YTA - what is the big deal if you cooked for the family for the entire relationship, but when you are unable to or simply do not want to, he orders takeout?", "YTA \n\nHe was upfront about this from the start. He doesn\u2019t expect you to cook for him and takes care of his own meals. There are 1000 places to get premade meals, which he has clearly been doing thus far and been fine. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t continue a relationship under the guise \u201cwell he\u2019s told me he doesn\u2019t want to do this, but I can CHANGE him\u201d. You wasted his time and your own.", "NTA there\u2019s a big difference in not liking cooking and absolutely refusing to ever do it. If you were to have kids would he just refuse to cook for them? You\u2019re not guaranteed to always afford takeout so if you\u2019re sick and you can\u2019t afford take out are you just not going to eat? This seems like if you both want the relationship to continue that you\u2019re going to have to have some pretty large conversations about what the future will hold though perhaps there\u2019s a compromise for example if you were to meal prep freezer meals would he be willing to pop them in the oven and watch them? Maybe it\u2019s the prep aspect that he\u2019s uncomfortable with but either way it\u2019s not really feasible to just get take out whenever you don\u2019t feel like cooking.", "He was very upfront about not cooking. Buys food when you can\u2019t cook. Doesn\u2019t complain if you don\u2019t cook for him. I don\u2019t see the problem? Man doesn\u2019t want to learn. I think you\u2019re not an asshole but I don\u2019t understand why this is so important to you. To each their own I guess. If you really do want a partner who cooks, you did the right thing, just as he did by sticking g with his choice not to - incompatible", "NTA. He's closed-minded by not even agreeing to try. He can make simple food instead of cooking something fancy. Every capable adult should be able to do that at the bare minimum. Takeout is expensive and the costs add up.\n\nIt sounds like part of the issue is him being able to take care of you when you can't take care of yourself. He should care about you enough to at least try something outside of his comfort zone. It's not an outrageous or scary thing to ask of someone.\n\nA normal man who loves you wouldn't want to lose you over something like this.", "I\u2019m torn between NAH and ESH. \n\nNAH because he doesn\u2019t want to cook, and you chose to make it a condition of marrying him which he doesn\u2019t want to do- he is free to say no. As you both have different priorities and are not a good match if you need to add on a condition to an engagement after five years. It\u2019s clearly so important to you that you had to communicate it at that moment, fair enough. \n\nAnd yet I sort of feel ESH: he\u2019s been clear about never wanting to cook, he buys you take out so presumably you aren\u2019t out of pocket, and yet you make it a condition of marriage. Should he choose this hill to die on? Maybe not, being able to make toast or a Mac and cheese or pesto pasta shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal to him. Should you have chosen to make this a \u2018condition\u2019 to your supposed to be lovely moment of engagement? Maybe not. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what it feels like to ask someone to marry you and they condition it when you\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t want to do that thing. No romantic yes I would love to we are a great match, but let me dig about cooking. I also can\u2019t imagine asking someone to learn how to make Mac and cheese when I\u2019m sick and they say no, I won\u2019t even heat you up soup.\n\nAnd yet, I see YTA comments and I\u2019m quite persuaded by it. You chose at that moment to put forth a condition of something he clearly wants to not do, and you try to force it as a condition of marriage. I think you\u2019ve thrown away a relationship that otherwise sounds great. If he was forcing you to cook, maybe I\u2019d feel differently (for eg misogynistic men who do that) but he hasn\u2019t. So YTA", "YTA. Going into a relationship with the thought \"I can change this about or improve this person\" was your first mistake. Investing 5 years into it, despite repeated discussions where he clearly stated his position and you were okay with it, since you continued in the relationship was the second. Making it a condition of a proposal, that's 3rd and final. If it's such an issue for you, why didn't you leave when he previously refused... makes absolutely no sense.", "YTA because you let it go 5 years without addressing the issue fully. He made it clear that he didn\u2019t want to learn. If it bothers you that much you should\u2019ve left already.\n\nHowever, I personally don\u2019t blame you for how you feel. IMO it is embarrassing to not have even a basic level of cooking ability as an adult. This is an essential life skill and his unwillingness to learn it is childish. Not saying he has to be a chef by any means, but have the ability to make food some types of food for yourself.", "His Mom thinks OP is wrong to add a condition and should have said no. Or maybe Mom's son should not have proposed if he wasn't prepared to be a husband.\n\nNTA", "If you\u2019re devastated you probably should have thought more about the ultimatum you gave him.  If you were happy with your decision you wouldn\u2019t be rethinking it.  From the sound of you questioning yourself I believe you think you are the asshole.  So I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say you\u2019re the asshole.", "You were with someone for 5 years and were about to get married, and you broke up because he didn\u2019t want to learn to cook? Sounds like there is a lot more to this story.", "this is difficult \n\non the one hand he made it clear from that start he\u2019s not doing that and you guys seem to have worked around it pretty well for five years \n\non the other, really? he believes so strongly about not even learning to cook a little pasta dish that he would throw away an entire life with someone? \n\neither there\u2019s something deeper here about the cooking (but i honestly can\u2019t imagine what it is?) or the entire proposal was an ill thought out mistake because no one comes to the decision to want to spend their life with someone and make a legal, marital commitment and then have their mind changed by something so frivolous", "I sort of get the YTA's and the NTA's.\n\nAnd I can't be the only one that's thinking, is there something else that happened?\n\nI get the ones who said, well he was honest upfront and you knew this about him, but I also get that you should be able to cook a home made meal sometime in the relationship, yes you can get away with ordering take out if she is sick, but like she said, take out isn't always the best option.\n\nI mean what is he eating when she isn't cooking for him? Is he just ordering take out all the time? Over time that costs money, and if they plan on living together and budgeting together that can become a problem, if they have kids and she needs him to pitch in and share the cooking, he should know how to cook some healthy well balanced meals for them?", "NTA - Aside the fact you should've addressed this much, much sooner, it's such a fundamental skill that it's utterly bizarre that he won't cook, won't even entertain the idea of doing anything towards cooking etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm guessing he either has some MASSIVE psychological issue regards it in terms of fire=bad, water around electricity and the like OR it's cultural and he/both of you are from a culture where it's deemed that women do the cooking - and therefore he won't entertain the idea because it's deemed \"womens work\" or something?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEither those options or he's just odd. Does he do his own breakfast cereal? Will he make a coffee/tea? Or does he just refuse to do anything in the kitchen like some kind of kitchen-phobic vampire?", "YTA\n\nHe communicated it from the beginning of the relationship, you was taken care of, whilst he personally did not make you any food, it was prepared for you.\n\nHe offered solutions, you rejected them even though you knew what you was getting into at the beginning of the relationship.\n\nYou did not even bother to respect his decision which did not harm you in the slightest or bother to ask him why.\n\nYou\u2019re selfish.", "If real, this is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. I have trouble believing it\u2019s real. YTA", "I mean he said this when moving in together right? You could've just as well broken up then. But it wasn't a problem. You made it your problem yourself, and forced it upon him. And to put it as a condition to accept his proposal, just WOW.\n\n  \nYTA by a mile sorry.", "NTA.  if he's unwilling to learn, you did the right thing by being honest.", "ESH.  This is an outdated hill to die on.  FWIW, I'm a very decent cook.  I have great knives, appliances, cookbooks.  And you know what?  I barely cook -- far too busy/tired at work.  There are so many more important life skills these days, with so many ready-made food options available.\n\nIf a SO didn't cook, my questions would be -- is (s)he a functional adult, able to shop / obtain healthy food within her/his budget?  Or does (s)he expect me or someone else to take care of feeding her/him?  If (s)he's a responsible/reasonable person, not cooking is just not a big deal.", "NTA overall. Cooking is a life skill. You don't have to like it, I don't, and I have a catering service 6 days a week, (which is cheaper than constant takeout) but if I couldn't afford to do so at any point I am fully capable of feeding myself.\nWhat happens if you have kids(if you want them) ? And you get sick? Are they living on takeout and fast food? \nYou're allowed to have standards and dealbreakers. This was one. \nOr if you moved to a more rural area and takeout wasn't the option it was in cities? \nPeople who refuse to learn life skills make 0 sense to me. You need to be capable of living on your own and taking care of yourself if you're an adult. (unless you're disabled)\n\nSoft YTA for dating someone who doesn't cook in the first place and who was clear with his boundaries. You can't change people. It's better to only date those who are compatible with you as they are.", "NTA\n\nWhat man in this day and age doesn't know how to cook? I cook most meals and my son likes to cook with me.\n\nMarriage is a partnership and you were right to have these discussions before it was too late. His stubbornness probably cost him a great wife.", "He doesn't want to learn to cook. He doesn't want to cook. He has adamantly stuck to that your entire relationship. I personally think that's asinine, but it's his decision. You knew that going in. So yes, trying to force him to learn to cook, for what, reasons? is a dick move. What if he were demanding you start doing something you don't want to do as a condition of marrying you? YTA.", "ESH- he\u2019s a child for be so unwilling and YTA for saying that during a freaking proposal.", "NTA, cooking is not optional in life", "YTA. As long he was pulling his weight in other areas, it shouldn\u2019t have mattered whether he wants to cook or not. It\u2019s one chore, you both could\u2019ve distributed chores in a way that him not cooking wouldn\u2019t put extra burden on you. I guess you didn\u2019t love him enough if you were able to throw away 5 years over this.", "NTA. What a stupid fucking hill to die on.", "YTA I think. You\u2019ve know for a long time that he doesn\u2019t cook and you should have told him earlier if it is a deal breaker. I get it\u2019s annoying, but if you\u2019re really that upset it\u2019s over then yes it\u2019s a very small hill to die on. You\u2019ve had many times to discuss this with him and only doing it during the proposal kinda sucks. This is just the person he is and you\u2019re trying to change him and he doesn\u2019t want to change and you either have to accept that or break up. It sounds like you expected by giving him an ultimatum he would drop everything and change to be how you want him to be.

Cooking is a very basic life skill, and if you want to have a future together it's ok to make sure you're on the same page. If you have children, does that mean he would never cook for them?

I am also thinking whether am I the asshole to expect him to learn cooking and adding that as a condition to his proposal?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA. He was very, very clear on the fact he would not cook. You decided you could change him. If him not cooking is the only bad thing in your relationship, you just threw something amazing away.", "NTA.\n\nYou're allowed to have your standards/expectations for what you want in a relationship... perhaps it being a condition of marrying him is not the best time/event to communicate it, but I wouldn't consider it an asshole move either... especially given how immature he's kinda playing out in this situation.", "Enh he said he doesn't like to cook based on how you wrote it. Not that he wouldn't cook. Now that you have stopped cooking due to sickness I wouldn't expect him to cook for you. You haven't for months. I honestly would have had an in depth discussion about life skills and how you guys will move in future if you had children or a severe illness or something. You need to know your partner can handle it and care for you especially if you have a strict diet. Just an example but smart to think about it. However his reluctance to not learn at all wouldn't be attractive to me and if that's a deal breaker then that's okay. Like I said the way it was written was that he didn't like to not that he couldn't. If you have to hesitate on a yes it's for a good reason. The deed is now done. Feel and let it out and love forward or rekindle.", "It seems to me that you both let go without a struggle. I think if you really wanted to marry him you would have said yes without reservation. So the pain you are suffering now is just because of the separation after living together for so long.", "FAIV YEARS of their lives she wasted because she thought she could change him, despite him never misleading her once. He didn't say he couldn't cook, he said he didn't like to.\n\nPeople can think what they want about what a man should and shouldn't do but ultimately if the verdict between two people is different and it's that important, this relationship should have ended years ago :(\n\nThis makes me a little sore because something similar happened to me and I ended up homeless after 5 years of what I thought was a relationship going well, so I'm a little overemphatic but YTA from my perspective.", "NAH. You want someone who at least wants to give an effort  to cook and he adamantly refuses to learn, which are both fair points. Though I agree that this could have been done sooner, you also stated you have been nudging him so it's not as if this was completely out of the blue. It's good that you learned your dealbreakers before marriage.", "NAH here with the caveat that you should never, ever move in with someone thinking you can change them.", "NAH, you are right to refuse to marry him. I m just wondering why you 2 live together. You are pretty much like a wife allready. You do wifey shit for your BF. Live by yourself. Right now he has no reason to change and do this little thing for you. if he allready refuses such a little request i wouldnt count on him on bigger stuff.", "INFO: do we know WHY he\u2019s so opposed to cooking? Does he think it\u2019s women\u2019s work? Did his sister die in a freak cooking accident? Has he tried in the past and just sucks at it for some reason, like he doesn\u2019t understand measuring or something?", "I think you mean NAH, then (No Assholes Here)", "He's not an asshole though. Should be NAH", "Nah that is fine for a temporary boyfriend but not okay for a lifetime partner. Like what about when she gets sick, or they have kids or she becomes disabled when they're old and he literally cannot manage to feed them properly. Even the burden of being the planner and cooker takes a toll. You say if it's not breaking the bank, it's still a huge waste of money over a lifetime. \n\nIts absolutely a deal-breaker for a life long partner to not be willing to learn one of the most fundamental skills. I would also say it reflects incredibly poorly on his parents and their child rearing skills to have failed to raise a well rounded person which is the biggest red flag be also won't be competent as a long term option.", "She could've broken up or talked about it when they were moving in together instead of putting it as a condition to accept his proposal.\n\nShe wanted to change him for her own wants, and it didn't work.", "Nope. This is a classic example of \"I can change him\". That makes OP the asshole.", "Why is it embarrassing to not know how to cook? Some people live in cities where they can order food delivery easily or buy meal deals/frozen foods from supermarkets. I know how to cook but I never consider this as an essential life skill.", "No it doesn't \"sound like there is more to the story\". Some people just don't like to cook.", "Yeah, does he have some sort of trauma related to cooking lmao? This is just weird on his part.", "That's what I'm thinking, too. To just completely shut down the idea so quickly... there's a reason.", "The moment she made the mistake of giving him an ultimatum she was the one that through the relationship away.", "I mean he can be odd right? He can live fine on his own, and he mate it clear he was like that. How is that a surprise?\n\nHer trying to change him is the point here. Just why? Didn't he inform her? Why didn't she take this seriously before? Seems important since she made it a condition for his proposal. So many red flags on her side whilst he was open about everything.\n\nIt's not his fault she kept assuming she can change him and then be let down. It may be odd that he doesn't wanna cook, but he did say that's what he wanted from the start. Nothing wrong with being odd.", "We have a coffee machine and most days he will not have breakfast directly move to lunch or will have a light snack like chips, pretzels, etc.", "He's unwilling to learn because she waited until the moment he proposed to give him an ultimatum. Id be heartbroken if my wife used that situation as leverage to get something she wanted.", "A 'great' wife that can't communicate, issues ultimatums and wants to change her partner's boundaries.  What is the problem if he can't cook? In the post it says that he never bothered her, he never asked her to cook for him so why should it matter.  He had made his boundary clear from the get go, she was the one who wanted to trample on his boundary.", "We don't know if he can cook, he just doesn't like to.\nNot everyone needs to like to do everything. Especially in a partnership, where both can complement each other.\n\nI know chefs that refuse to cook in their free time.", "I mean he even said in no way she has to cook for him just herself, she tried and he wasn't bothered by it. She was just trying to find an excuse.", "Everything else is divided between us very evenly and it has worked for us and I don't wish to change that but my only complaint to him was to learn how to cook basic meals. I am not asking him to cook regularly only when I can't or I am not able to because I am I'll or some shit. And about your point of me not loving him enough doesn't that apply to him as well that he is unwilling to learn even if it costs him this relationship?", "For both of them.", "What she need to do is not to start a relationship off thinking she will change someone to whinshe wants them to be instead of accepting him for whichever was. \n\nAt best, it would be N A H but because she started this relationship as AH immediately wanting to stomp on his boundary and change him", "Look I am not asking him to cook regularly but if I ever get sick I don't want to eat takeout and probably get more sick.", "Yes I have asked him to cook or atleast start learning basic things because if I ever get sick again he will just order takeout for us and I don't wanna eat takeout while being sick and get more sick", "Agree.  That's my take, too. She went into the relationship with the goal that she will stomp all over his very clear boundary and she will change him. For that alone, she is an AH. But then after 5 years, she doubles down and gives an ultimatum. He handled it perfectly", "I mean how can you marry someone that can't cook? Does he only eat take out? There's no way he is eating a healthy diet if he can't cook anything for himself and she doesn't usually cook for him. Plus then you run into issues where what if OP gets in an accident and can't cook for days or weeks or even months? He can't even cook her up some eggs or toast? You're gonna be ordering UberEATS at 6am?\n\nBut I do agree they should certainly have discussed this far sooner than 5 years into a relationship.", "After 5 years it shouldn't have been a deal breaker", "Really, and what happens with the next issue he refuses to compromise/budge on? \n\nNope ESH", "You don't have to be passionate about it to learn a basic survival skill. Covid came out of no where, what if that happens again and he's single? He'll sit and die?", "Then shouldn't your judgement be N-A-H? Cause i fail to see how he is the A? You say she is allowed to have expectations, but the second he has expectations he becomes the A?  The only difference is that he was honest from the get go about not cooking, but she was the one that springed the fact that him not cooking was a deal breaker. That is what makes her YTA", "Can't wrap around my head how people can rule N-T-A on this.\n\nThey're saying like it's basic, if he won't even learn that, you can't marry someone who cooks...LIKE HE SAID IT FROM THE START THATS NOT THE POINT.\n\nShe knew and she kept te relationsip going, and now at the and when she tried to change him and he didn't agree, it's his fault cuz he won't learn something so simple. I mean...", ">Like what about when she gets sick,\n\nHe already handled that, by getting food for her elsewhere. Not being able or willing to cook isn't the same as starving.\n\nIt's fine for her to set that boundary around her life partner, and it's fair for him to decline following it and breaking up. But making it a condition to marrying him is the wrong approach - you don't try to coerce your partner into complying with your ideas of your life together.", "What happens when they can't afford to constantly eat out/order in or if they move to a rural area without those options for work?", "an ultimatum.. about learning a basic life skill? \n\nan ultimatum, *to me* requires sacrificing one thing for another, learning to cook a few easy meals is hardly a sacrifice. although i do completely get that he\u2019s already said he won\u2019t from the start and it\u2019s worked thus far. \n\ni understand your point but i think condition is a better descriptor than ultimatum.\n\ni believe OP was in the wrong, really wasn\u2019t the time or place to bring up something like that and if it was that serious to them then they should\u2019ve brought up the issue with their partner long before the proposal but i don\u2019t believe ultimatum is correct", "I mean is he at least getting healthy take out options? If he was willing to cover 80% of old roomies rent then he is must be dead serious about never wanting to cook, it's so BIZARRE he would go to such lengths!", "How is he an asshole? She Knew going into this that he doesn't want to cook and he didn't force or coerce her to cook for him. YTA op", "He made it clear to you since the day he moved in that would never cook. While you didn\u2019t make it clear to him that this would be a dealbreaker for you. So no, the same logic doesn\u2019t apply to him.\n\nIf your problem with him not cooking was this severe, why didn\u2019t you talk to him directly instead of dumping this on him the moment he proposed? Did you never try to find out WHY he\u2019s so against cooking?", "Did you ask WHY?", "What does he eat when you don't cook for him? I mean is he living off take away?", "The question wasn't what you tried making him do, but why he doesn't want to cook.", "Oh, for sure. I would marry someone who won\u2019t learn basic life skills. My issue is that she knew this was a hard line for her and thought she was going to change him.", "It must have been really grinding on her, and they must have been having arguments over it, because why on earth when your BF is proposing to you would you bring that up as a stipulation. It had to have been a really sore spot for them. \n\nI'm not saying she is in the right 100% for bringing it up when he proposed, but I have this feeling he might not have been shocked that this ended things??", "**Then shouldn't your judgement be N-A-H?** \n\nYeah? I *did* said NTA/\"NAH\"...?\n\n**Cause i fail to see how he is the A?**\n\nI didn't say he was the AH though.

And yeah sure, it's probably unfair that she suddenly changed her mind and sprung it on him during the proposal.. Like I said, it probably wasn't the best timing/event to say it, but is changing your mind an ASSHOLE thing? I don't think so. Did it mean she wasn't honest/lied? Not necessarily either.", "In his current income bracket. Add a child, unemployment or retirement into the mix and it's a huge liability. \n\nThe hill he is willing to die on is learning a basic life skill. Honestly it's as bad a not being toilet trained.", "I stand by what I said but I agree on the second portion. Making it a \"condition\" is ridiculous. I also think it's something that should have been stated before they got serious as a couple. If she honestly believed there was no part of her that would marry him, KNOWING he refused to cook or even learn, she should have ended it a long time ago.", "I guess the said boyfriend will just buy cheap premade meal/frozen food and NOT move to a rural area. Still, what you said are hypothetical scenarios that don\u2019t constitute as sound arguments. Plus the boyfriend clearly was doing fine without knowing how to cook. It will be embarrassing if he doesn\u2019t even know how to do laundry, but cooking is a whole different matter. I just don\u2019t understand how it is an essential life skill when there are so many alternative ways to get edible food without knowing how to cook.\n\nedit: typo", "Condition or ultimatum.

I didn't mean to imply he was, if I did.", "I didn't dump this in him out of nowhere I have been asking him to atleast learn basic things and he has refused every time and I did not know he was gonna propose so when he did I wanted to say yes but I couldn't without making my opinion clear", "It doesn't matter why. A no is a no.", "Yes ofc I have, he always says the same stuff \"I don't like it, I don't want to...blah blah\"", "Before I moved in his roommate was doing all the cooking and in return my bf would cover like 80 percent of the rent. And after I moved in he has had takeout almost all days", "Yeah, for this to be a \"calm\" breakup as well, no way this was a surprise. If she threw that condition at him out of nowhere, there would be a massive fight you would think?", "I believe when you use \"nta\" thet means ther other part is. \"Nah\" is \"no asses here\" or something like that..", "There is no way this was a surprise to him, you guys must have been arguing about this ALOT for you to bring it up in his proposal, like it was a sore spot in the relationship. \n\nHe can't have been that naive to think she isn't going to keep going on about this, I bet you argued about this a fair bit?", "> I didn\u2019t dump this on him out of nowhere \n\nYou literally did. You may have been pushing him to cook, but you never told him you would break up with him or reject his proposal over this. He had no clue you\u2019d do this if he refused to cook. That\u2019s called dumping shit on someone. And you didn\u2019t answer my question, did you bother asking him why he doesn\u2019t want to cook?", "Way to take on board his reasons for not wanting to cook or learn\ud83d\ude44  how would you feel if shoe was on the other foot, not too happy I'd bet. If this is how he is and always has been, for his reasons as bizarre as they may seem to folk, they're his reasons and you went into this for 5 years with your eyes wide open and STILL thought you could change him", "It's definitely weird,  I mean yes, lot's of people don't cook because they don't like, but to be this adamant about not even trying to  learn to cook some basics on the off chance you may need him to cook you some nice home made meals is strange?\n\nAlso, the financial implications of you two getting married, spending all that money on take-away must be an issue that would come up?", "Man, you'd think he'd sign up for one of those fresh ready made meal delivery services at that point.

And I do make dinner for both but due to our schedule it's not possible for everyday", "He literally does other chores. It\u2019s not like he\u2019s asking OP to do everything.

THIRTY. almost half a century old. and refusing to learn how to cook like he\u2019s a fucking child. that\u2019s legitimately insane to me how someone can have that mindset and then expect that their relationship will work out."]}
