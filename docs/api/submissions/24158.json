He will manage on his own and I should only cook for him if and only if I want to' I was a bit taken aback by this but we continued with this arrangement. \n\nFor the first 6 months we didn't have any problem but I got sick for a day or two and I couldn't cook so I had to ask him if he can do it. He refused and said he don't worry I will order something and he did. From that day onwards I have been occassionally nudging him to learn cooking and he has refused immediately. He has made it clear so for that last few months I have only been making dinner for myself and he has not complained about it at all. \n\nOn Sunday he proposed to me and I really wanted to say yes but I said that I will say yes only if he learns how to cook. He waited a moment and said \"I guess that's a no\" and went to the living room I followed him and we had the following conversation\n\nMe: it's not a no, I am sorry but it's just about the food, I am not sure how long you can stay without learning to cook.\n\nHim: it's okay, you don't need to apologise, and I have lived so long without learning it, I think I can manage.\n\nMe: are you really adamant about not learning it? Even I said I don't want to be with someone who doesn't cook atleast something basic.\n\nHim: I am not learning it. And if you feel so strong about it then I guess we are not a good match.\n\n\nWe broke up and I moved out.it was a calm discussion but I was a lot emotional and upset because we have spent last 5 years together and he was so unwilling to learn.\n\nYesterday his mom called me to check on me and we talked and she said she understands my point of view but she thinks I am wrong to add a condition like that. I should have said no to his proposal. \n\nI am devastated and I really miss him apart from this one issue we had never had any differences. I am also thinking whether am I the asshole to expect him to learn cooking and adding that as a condition to his proposal?\n\n\nEdit: Since many people have commented about having kids in future. I just want to add that we have discussed kids and he has also made it clear that he doesn't want any. I too have agreed with him about kids but I am not as sure as him regarding kids", "created_utc": 1691482795, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lbti7/aita_for_adding_a_condition_to_my_bfs_proposal/", "score": 896, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s childish for whatever his hang up with cooking is, but he was honest and up front about it.  You\u2019ve dragged this relationship on for 1.5 years when you knew this was a big issue for you.", "INFO: what does he eat now then, if you\u2019re not cooking for him and he refuses to? Does he just have cereal for dinner or does he order takeaway every night? If it\u2019s the takeaway thing I can see how that might be an expensive lifestyle to maintain if you\u2019re eventually going to join your finances", "Yeah, YTA. Adding a condition to a proposal? You had to know that wasn't going to fly. \n\nLook, he told you he doesn't cook. You thought you could get him to, but you couldn't, so you try to make it a condition of marrying him? His mom is right, you should've just declined.", "NTA He'd rather leave a 5 year relationship than learn to cook??? That's insane for me.", "NTA, no, if this is a deal breaker for you. I hate cooking but have a deal with my significant one, he always cooks and I always clean. It works for us, he loves to cook and I have no objection to cleaning.\nMaybe you can find a compromise?", "Most outsiders (including me) will think this is a really weird place to end up, but, weirdness aside and taking your situation as presented .... NTA.  You were both clear about your position, now you just have to accept the consequences of the condition you imposed, just as he appears to accept the consequences of his position.", "YTA. Him not cooking means you have to break up? I knew some men who loved to cook. I know MANY who do not. Why is that such a big deal? He isn't forcing you to make him a meal everyday. If it isn't breaking his bank to eat out, I don't get why you're so pressed to force him to learn how to cook.", "Soft YTA. He was very clear upfront he didn\u2019t like to cook and had no intentions of cooking. Now, as a guy, I do honestly find that a bit ridiculous. But he was honest and didn\u2019t expect to burden you with it either.\n\nIt is okay that this would be a dealbreaker for you. But it is unfair you held onto this for five years and only brought it up when he proposed. If it was that much of an issue, it should have been brought up years ago. I think you were unfair to him for making his proposal conditional on something he was clear he was not changing.", "NTA And right condition if it is a dealbreaker for you. \n\nMy mom got married my father who have never wanted to learn how to cook and she always basically have a 3-rd child who always ask ways for dinner and if she is not there goes to cafe every day or take out. That\u2019s important", "YTA. \n\nHis stance is that he does NOT WANT to cook. While you keep talking about him LEARNING to cook. Lets say that you pressured him to LEARN to cook. It doesn't change the fact that he does not WANT to cook. \n\nBut what makes it 10 times worse is that you made it an ultimatum for accepting proposal. Way to kill of the mood.", "YTA. He\u2019s pulling his weight everywhere else. He doesn\u2019t want to cook and on the days you can\u2019t cook he orders takeout. That\u2019s a perfectly good alternative. If you were doing everything and him sitting on his arse watching I\u2019d have a different opinion but geez, you\u2019ve lost this person over such a ridiculous issue.", "YTA - what is the big deal if you cooked for the family for the entire relationship, but when you are unable to or simply do not want to, he orders takeout?", "YTA \n\nHe was upfront about this from the start. He doesn\u2019t expect you to cook for him and takes care of his own meals. There are 1000 places to get premade meals, which he has clearly been doing thus far and been fine. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t continue a relationship under the guise \u201cwell he\u2019s told me he doesn\u2019t want to do this, but I can CHANGE him\u201d. You wasted his time and your own.", "NTA there\u2019s a big difference in not liking cooking and absolutely refusing to ever do it. If you were to have kids would he just refuse to cook for them? You\u2019re not guaranteed to always afford takeout so if you\u2019re sick and you can\u2019t afford take out are you just not going to eat? This seems like if you both want the relationship to continue that you\u2019re going to have to have some pretty large conversations about what the future will hold though perhaps there\u2019s a compromise for example if you were to meal prep freezer meals would he be willing to pop them in the oven and watch them? Maybe it\u2019s the prep aspect that he\u2019s uncomfortable with but either way it\u2019s not really feasible to just get take out whenever you don\u2019t feel like cooking.", "He was very upfront about not cooking. Buys food when you can\u2019t cook. Doesn\u2019t complain if you don\u2019t cook for him. I don\u2019t see the problem? Man doesn\u2019t want to learn. I think you\u2019re not an asshole but I don\u2019t understand why this is so important to you. To each their own I guess. If you really do want a partner who cooks, you did the right thing, just as he did by sticking g with his choice not to - incompatible", "NTA. He's closed-minded by not even agreeing to try. He can make simple food instead of cooking something fancy. Every capable adult should be able to do that at the bare minimum. Takeout is expensive and the costs add up.\n\nIt sounds like part of the issue is him being able to take care of you when you can't take care of yourself. He should care about you enough to at least try something outside of his comfort zone. It's not an outrageous or scary thing to ask of someone.\n\nA normal man who loves you wouldn't want to lose you over something like this.", "I\u2019m torn between NAH and ESH. \n\nNAH because he doesn\u2019t want to cook, and you chose to make it a condition of marrying him which he doesn\u2019t want to do- he is free to say no. As you both have different priorities and are not a good match if you need to add on a condition to an engagement after five years. It\u2019s clearly so important to you that you had to communicate it at that moment, fair enough. \n\nAnd yet I sort of feel ESH: he\u2019s been clear about never wanting to cook, he buys you take out so presumably you aren\u2019t out of pocket, and yet you make it a condition of marriage. Should he choose this hill to die on? Maybe not, being able to make toast or a Mac and cheese or pesto pasta shouldn\u2019t be such a big deal to him. Should you have chosen to make this a \u2018condition\u2019 to your supposed to be lovely moment of engagement? Maybe not. \n\nI can\u2019t imagine what it feels like to ask someone to marry you and they condition it when you\u2019ve made it clear you don\u2019t want to do that thing. No romantic yes I would love to we are a great match, but let me dig about cooking. I also can\u2019t imagine asking someone to learn how to make Mac and cheese when I\u2019m sick and they say no, I won\u2019t even heat you up soup.\n\nAnd yet, I see YTA comments and I\u2019m quite persuaded by it. You chose at that moment to put forth a condition of something he clearly wants to not do, and you try to force it as a condition of marriage. I think you\u2019ve thrown away a relationship that otherwise sounds great. If he was forcing you to cook, maybe I\u2019d feel differently (for eg misogynistic men who do that) but he hasn\u2019t. So YTA", "YTA. Going into a relationship with the thought \"I can change this about or improve this person\" was your first mistake. Investing 5 years into it, despite repeated discussions where he clearly stated his position and you were okay with it, since you continued in the relationship was the second. Making it a condition of a proposal, that's 3rd and final. If it's such an issue for you, why didn't you leave when he previously refused... makes absolutely no sense.", "YTA because you let it go 5 years without addressing the issue fully. He made it clear that he didn\u2019t want to learn. If it bothers you that much you should\u2019ve left already.\n\nHowever, I personally don\u2019t blame you for how you feel. IMO it is embarrassing to not have even a basic level of cooking ability as an adult. This is an essential life skill and his unwillingness to learn it is childish. Not saying he has to be a chef by any means, but have the ability to make food some types of food for yourself.", "His Mom thinks OP is wrong to add a condition and should have said no. Or maybe Mom's son should not have proposed if he wasn't prepared to be a husband.\n\nNTA", "If you\u2019re devastated you probably should have thought more about the ultimatum you gave him.  If you were happy with your decision you wouldn\u2019t be rethinking it.  From the sound of you questioning yourself I believe you think you are the asshole.  So I\u2019m gonna go ahead and say you\u2019re the asshole.", "You were with someone for 5 years and were about to get married, and you broke up because he didn\u2019t want to learn to cook? Sounds like there is a lot more to this story.", "this is difficult \n\non the one hand he made it clear from that start he\u2019s not doing that and you guys seem to have worked around it pretty well for five years \n\non the other, really? he believes so strongly about not even learning to cook a little pasta dish that he would throw away an entire life with someone? \n\neither there\u2019s something deeper here about the cooking (but i honestly can\u2019t imagine what it is?) or the entire proposal was an ill thought out mistake because no one comes to the decision to want to spend their life with someone and make a legal, marital commitment and then have their mind changed by something so frivolous", "I sort of get the YTA's and the NTA's.\n\nAnd I can't be the only one that's thinking, is there something else that happened?\n\nI get the ones who said, well he was honest upfront and you knew this about him, but I also get that you should be able to cook a home made meal sometime in the relationship, yes you can get away with ordering take out if she is sick, but like she said, take out isn't always the best option.\n\nI mean what is he eating when she isn't cooking for him? Is he just ordering take out all the time? Over time that costs money, and if they plan on living together and budgeting together that can become a problem, if they have kids and she needs him to pitch in and share the cooking, he should know how to cook some healthy well balanced meals for them?", "NTA - Aside the fact you should've addressed this much, much sooner, it's such a fundamental skill that it's utterly bizarre that he won't cook, won't even entertain the idea of doing anything towards cooking etc.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm guessing he either has some MASSIVE psychological issue regards it in terms of fire=bad, water around electricity and the like OR it's cultural and he/both of you are from a culture where it's deemed that women do the cooking - and therefore he won't entertain the idea because it's deemed \"womens work\" or something?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEither those options or he's just odd. Does he do his own breakfast cereal? Will he make a coffee/tea? Or does he just refuse to do anything in the kitchen like some kind of kitchen-phobic vampire?", "YTA\n\nHe communicated it from the beginning of the relationship, you was taken care of, whilst he personally did not make you any food, it was prepared for you.\n\nHe offered solutions, you rejected them even though you knew what you was getting into at the beginning of the relationship.\n\nYou did not even bother to respect his decision which did not harm you in the slightest or bother to ask him why.\n\nYou\u2019re selfish.", "If real, this is the stupidest thing I\u2019ve ever heard. I have trouble believing it\u2019s real. YTA", "I mean he said this when moving in together right? You could've just as well broken up then. But it wasn't a problem. You made it your problem yourself, and forced it upon him. And to put it as a condition to accept his proposal, just WOW.\n\n  \nYTA by a mile sorry.", "NTA.  if he's unwilling to learn, you did the right thing by being honest.", "ESH.  This is an outdated hill to die on.  FWIW, I'm a very decent cook.  I have great knives, appliances, cookbooks.  And you know what?  I barely cook -- far too busy/tired at work.  There are so many more important life skills these days, with so many ready-made food options available.\n\nIf a SO didn't cook, my questions would be -- is (s)he a functional adult, able to shop / obtain healthy food within her/his budget?  Or does (s)he expect me or someone else to take care of feeding her/him?  If (s)he's a responsible/reasonable person, not cooking is just not a big deal.", "NTA overall. Cooking is a life skill. You don't have to like it, I don't, and I have a catering service 6 days a week, (which is cheaper than constant takeout) but if I couldn't afford to do so at any point I am fully capable of feeding myself.\nWhat happens if you have kids(if you want them) ? And you get sick? Are they living on takeout and fast food? \nYou're allowed to have standards and dealbreakers. This was one. \nOr if you moved to a more rural area and takeout wasn't the option it was in cities? \nPeople who refuse to learn life skills make 0 sense to me. You need to be capable of living on your own and taking care of yourself if you're an adult. (unless you're disabled)\n\nSoft YTA for dating someone who doesn't cook in the first place and who was clear with his boundaries. You can't change people. It's better to only date those who are compatible with you as they are.", "NTA\n\nWhat man in this day and age doesn't know how to cook? I cook most meals and my son likes to cook with me.\n\nMarriage is a partnership and you were right to have these discussions before it was too late. His stubbornness probably cost him a great wife.", "He doesn't want to learn to cook. He doesn't want to cook. He has adamantly stuck to that your entire relationship. I personally think that's asinine, but it's his decision. You knew that going in. So yes, trying to force him to learn to cook, for what, reasons? is a dick move. What if he were demanding you start doing something you don't want to do as a condition of marrying you? YTA.", "ESH- he\u2019s a child for be so unwilling and YTA for saying that during a freaking proposal.", "NTA, cooking is not optional in life", "YTA. As long he was pulling his weight in other areas, it shouldn\u2019t have mattered whether he wants to cook or not. It\u2019s one chore, you both could\u2019ve distributed chores in a way that him not cooking wouldn\u2019t put extra burden on you. I guess you didn\u2019t love him enough if you were able to throw away 5 years over this.", "NTA. What a stupid fucking hill to die on.", "YTA I think. You\u2019ve know for a long time that he doesn\u2019t cook and you should have told him earlier if it is a deal breaker. I get it\u2019s annoying, but if you\u2019re really that upset it\u2019s over then yes it\u2019s a very small hill to die on. You\u2019ve had many times to discuss this with him and only doing it during the proposal kinda sucks. This is just the person he is and you\u2019re trying to change him and he doesn\u2019t want to change and you either have to accept that or break up. It sounds like you expected by giving him an ultimatum he would drop everything and change to be how you want him to be.

Cooking is a very basic life skill, and if you want to have a future together it's ok to make sure you're on the same page. If you have children, does that mean he would never cook for them?

IMO, if the chore distribution is equal (maybe bc he does more dishes and grocery shopping or whatever while you do the cooking and meal planning), and he is able to get takeout on nights you are unable to cook, that is still a fair and healthy enough arrangement.\n\nETA: having read your comments I think I\u2019m even more solidly in this camp.

It's not like she demanded he disown family/children/sign over all finances/kill the firstborn sons of their country. It's cooking. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Her trying to change him is the point here. Just why? Didn't he inform her? Why didn't she take this seriously before? Seems important since she made it a condition for his proposal. So many red flags on her side whilst he was open about everything.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nJesus. She's not demanding he cease contact with friends, family or forgoe anything. Cooking is such a fundamental, simple, life skill that it's beyond fucking weird someone point blank refuses. **That's** the biggest red flag. Her saying \"Well, yes, but can you do some cooking, just sometimes, maybe, a little?\" isn't a red flag. Yes, she should've just fucking laughed at his inane and weird stance on it the very first time it was brought up - laugh him out the house tbh - but she didn't. But it's not some arbitrary condition of marriage she just thought up on the spot for shits and gigges to make him jump through hoops just because. It's something thats a continued issue between them, just it's come to a head - better now than post-marriage surely?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> It's not his fault she kept assuming she can change him and then be let down.

Which is perfectly fine. He's the one being a toddler and throwing his toys out the pram so he gets his little way.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd of course his view on cooking is his fault. No-ones holding someone ransom under threat of death if he dares bake a cake. He's made a decision, for whatever bizarre reason, that he shall never combine ingredients in a kitchen for the purpose of making a meal. That's not just odd, that's full on red-flag waving \"run while you still can\" stuff. Odd is not liking a specfic dish, being phobic of spoons, only eating meat on certain days so you don't anger certain sky fairies or whatever.

At that point, it\u2019s not about boundaries or your own meals, it\u2019s about the shared project of raising children and running a family. \n\nLike, I mostly cook. I generally enjoy it, I\u2019m much better at it, so I do most of the cooking. However, it\u2019s tiring! And it also means I\u2019m generally planning our grocery lists and thinking about what\u2019s in the fridge and what we need to use up. Because my husband and I share responsibilities and it\u2019s his food too, he\u2019ll cook if I\u2019m unable, and he also usually washed the dishes and buys the groceries half of the time. Which is great, and usually works out!

If my partner couldn\u2019t cook a balanced, nutritious meal for our family when I was unable (or just didn\u2019t want to), that would be stressful for me. I would be in bed trying to recover and worrying, and I would probably be pushing myself to cook before I otherwise would have or had the energy to because of that. \n\nI encourage you to go read about mental load and about how women generally experience housework. When women started working more, their share of housework and household management basically didn\u2019t decrease.
