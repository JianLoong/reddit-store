And she was incredibly rude, demanding, and entitled.  \n\nHaving said that, don't engage with crazy.  It doesn't work and you end up getting the blowback (as you are finding out).\n\nMy  little sister always has an opinion.  On every.single.thing.  And she is always \"right\".  My parents have always said that since we are sisters we should be best friends.  That we should be super close--that our relationship should be the closest relationship we have.   \n\nWell, we don't.  She is a putrid wave of incessant drama and negativity.  She never shuts up.  She talks hatefully behind people's backs while being sweet to their face.   We have literally nothing in common--not even our relationship with our parents since they always treated us so differently.  So now my mantra is that since her philosophy seems to be \"my way or the highway\", I am choosing the highway.  \n\nMy suggestion?  Also choose the highway.  Have a pleasant relationship with your parents if they allow it, but generally ignore your sister.  Be polite when you must interact.  Just don't go out of your way to be around her.  \n\nRight now, my sister is mad because I refused to do something stupid that she insisted I must do (which would have been a terribly decision as I tried to tell her at the time).  So she lobbed a final insult via text and has barely acknowledged my existence since then.  Which, actually, has been a great source of amusement.  Esp. when she talks to the general air trying to tell me what to do or what to buy her for Christmas/birthdays/etc.", "NTA. You may have been a bit harsh in your response,,,,,well actually for mentioning the blood related thing you're probably a soft YTA.  But seriously, she started it with her snotty demand. Why should you be the only one to apologize?  Enjoy your party.", "NTA.  May be a good time to go LC or NC with her and explain this to your parents. I used to have a lot of issues with my sister because she would constantly put me down and treat me terribly.  And my parents would always just tell me to put up with it.  I finally told them that they needed to stop telling me that because they were treating the symptoms and not the disease. And that I would no longer put up with her attitude, so either she changes or I was no longer going to keep contact with her. To their credit, they actually did speak to her. Things are decent now. And even if they weren\u2019t, I would not regret telling my parents because it\u2019s just wrong to put pressure on one child, especially when the source of tension is the other one.\n\nSeparately, your BIL charged you 180% interest?! WTF.", "NTA. Just go NC. Not worth it.\n\n>my parents are telling me to just apologize to shut her up \n\nThat is probably why she acts like this.", "NTA!", "NTA", "NTA just disinvite her and be done with her bs. Doesn't sound like anything good will come out of this relationship", "Nta. Don't force a bond that isn't there.", "NTA", "NTA and you can have any kind of party you want.

Great response to her holier than thou attitude.", "NTA. However if she's married to them they're your nephews through marriage (whether you acknowledge that or not is on you but they are) and unless her husband was cheating with her she didn't steal another lady's family she married into a family. Big difference.", "Everyone here kinda sucks, but I guess I\u2019ll land on NTA.\n\nHer behavior and expectations are bs. Her example of generosity is thinly veiled narcissistic bs at best.\n\nAll that said, maybe be a little less dismissive of her adopted/step kids eh? If she considers them hers, and their father considers her a mother-figure, and the kids are ok/welcoming/attached to her, their her kids. It\u2019s kind of crappy to toss it in her face that she\u2019s somehow less than a parent just because of DNA\u2026", "NTA\n\nThere is a difference between being around people drinking,  and being around drunk people.\n\nThe former is fine for children and what should be happening at your party.", "NTA. She can't dictate how you host a party. If she doesn't like it, she doesn't have to go. Maybe the harshness of your comment will keep her from at least trying the same thing in the future. It also sounds like other people only want you to apologize to make her shut up, not because you were in the wrong. Stand your ground, because until someone does, she's just going to continue to pull this kind of crap.", "NTA, if she\u2019s ranting all over Facebook, make you\u2019re own post, tag everyone she has tagged or responded to her post with exactly what happened. It\u2019s an unreasonable request, and what makes it worse was that it wasn\u2019t a request but a demand about something happening in a house that isn\u2019t hers.", "Her husband isn't generous. He gave you a loan at an 180% interest rate. A good loan is one below the average which is 10% in the US. That isn't generosity, that is a very scummy business transaction.\n\nThat being said, saying she stole her family is a bit far unless she is a homewrecker. If they divorced then it isn't her stealing the family rather that she was accepted into the family and her wanting to be a mother for them isn't something to discourage. She should want to get close and become a mother figure considering she literally is a legal guardian and has a duty to raise them.\n\nESH - You are an AH for the rude comments about her stealing the family. She is for her demands/attitude.

And I follow my mother in the sense that she is always the peacemaker, whether in her extended family or in our nuclear one. But at some point, asking somebody to blatantly do that with toxic family members is just emotionally manipulative. In my case especially because my parents counted on me to listen to them (they\u2019re actually a bit afraid of my sister)? And back then they used the fact that I was school and financially dependent upon them. Which is just terrible, honestly  speaking.  It\u2019s weird because I don\u2019t think they ever thought of pushing back on their adult child (my sister), but I think me pushing back on them was sort of a wake up call.
