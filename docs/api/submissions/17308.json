Ever since, i haven't really contacted either of my parents too much. \n\nBoth my parents had horribly marital issues and are still together for God knows what reason, the constant fighting and \"who do you love more\" has been a part of my life ever since i can remember.\n\nMy dad was probably the worse of the two. He has OCD and some form of adhd coupled with a horrible anxiety disorder. He was incredibly abusive and although he's only hit me a couple of times the verbal abuse was non stop. He's made me so insecure that at one point i almost begged my mom to get me a skin bleaching serum. He's Indian and this kind of stuff was apparently okay because somehow it's the norm or some bs.\n\nI don't even want to get started on how much of an ass he was to my mom. This stuff continued till i was fifteen, until my mom had had enough and took us to her mother's place for a three month vacation, where they somehow still managed to fight. He was probably shaken to the core because he became incredibly affectionate when we returned. \n\nAnyway I wished my mom a happy mother's day and In return i got fifteen missed calls from my dad and a very angry message regarding how hurt he was because even after he had changed and tried to be a better father i refused to acknowledge it and shouldn't hold those things over his head because he was mentally ill. He begged me to just give him an opportunity to show that he's changed. \nI just told him that i can't let go of all the pain he caused and still causes me and that I'm adamant on my decision, i then politely told him that I'd rather not have any contact with him whatsoever \n\nMy mom tells me to let it go because it was all in the past and that he's a changed man, i just feel it's too quick for him to change this drastically. And regardless if he does or doesn't i dealt with his shit for long enough and i really can't get over how hellish my life was in his presence. \nMy whole family is currently incredibly mad that i cut him off and are desperately trying to convince me to give him another chance. I'm getting call after text. My uncle even went as far as calling my roommate when i wouldn't answer the calls. I might have to cut off my whole family if this continues\n\n WIBTA for not giving him another chance?", "created_utc": 1684163071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13iaw3f/aita_for_telling_my_dad_i_dont_want_to_have/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When I was 12 I found out he was addicted to heroin. He was in and out of my life for years, my parents separated and later divorced. For years I hated him and what he did to my mom and I. I went low to no contact with him, only speaking every few years.\n\nI told myself that I would get my life together, and then I would think about making amends with him so we could both be at peace. 2 months ago he had a stroke and was terminally diagnosed with brain cancer. He is currently laying on his death bed with aphasia so bad he cannot speak clearly or even write letters that form real words.\n\nWhat I thought I had, I didn't. Time. We are always running out of it. Now I have had to deal with all of the trauma again. A couple years ago I would've been more than glad to live without him in my life. Now I fear not finding peace before it's too late.\n\nYou should do whatever you feel is necessary to make peace with your parents and get some closure. You don't want to go the rest of your life holding onto any negative and unproductive emotions.", "NTA. Mental illness can be the reason but never the excuse.\n\nI have dealt with depression, anxiety, and PTSD in some combination or another for more than a decade, but I would never treat anyone your father treated you and I would never expect anyone to put up with it, if I did.\n\nFurthermore, if he truly changed, he wouldn't be using the same manipulative and abusive tactics to get you back in his life. If he truly changed, he would offer heartfelt and specific apologies and then let you set the parameters of the relationship with no pressure to let him back in your life.\n\nThe fact that he immediately became abusive again when things didn't go his way is a clear indicator that he hasn't changed.\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTRKs4Yk7/\n\nI highly recommend working through this flow chart. It's about how to set boundaries in a relationship in a way that reflects your person values."]}
