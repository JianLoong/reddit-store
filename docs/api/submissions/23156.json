When I found out that I was pregnant with my first child the first person I called was my sister 19f. Her first words \"where how could you?!\" I cried and hung up on her. Shes been trying to get pregnant with her situation ship for about 5 months. She still lives at home with our mom. Shes talking about quitting her job also. \n\nFor a little context my sister and me went through school in the same grade. We are both adopted from infancy from the state. Shes a tall natural blonde with blue eyes. I'm a short brunette with brown eyes. We are opposites in the full meaning. From middle school and up she got a lot of attention from boys and had a lot of girl friends. She was a cheerleader and all around popular girl. Which is fine. What wasnt fine was her constant bullying towards me. I was and still am an art nerd. I liked to be on my own mostly. I'm autistic and crowds just were never my thing. I also did matching band and JROTC. She used to help people throw rocks at my head when we would walk home from school. She started a rumor that I was pregnant our senior year. Theres a lot more that I don't want to discuss. She apologized for it when I moved out. I thought our relationship was on the mend. Until today.\n\nToday she had to get me from a work meeting because my boyfriend had the car at his work in a different city. We have one car because I dont drive. While in the car with her she asks how I've been feeling. I tell her I've been okay, but was still thinking about what she said and how it hurt my feelings. Her reply was she wanted us to be pregnant together because our childhood wasnt the best together and she wanted our kids to have a better relationship than we did. I reminded her that was her fault for being a bully to me growing up. She said I made it impossible to be nice to me because I was \"weird\". I asked what she meant and she basically said because I wasnt interested in the things she was, I was weird and deserved the bullying. I told her I did not want her to be pregnant anytime I was and I didnt want our kids growing up together.  I'm considering not letting her around my child. My boyfriend said he doesn't have an opinion,  and that if that's what I choose to do that's okay.\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1690336860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159sde4/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_her_being/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
