When I found out that I was pregnant with my first child the first person I called was my sister 19f. Her first words \"where how could you?!\" I cried and hung up on her. Shes been trying to get pregnant with her situation ship for about 5 months. She still lives at home with our mom. Shes talking about quitting her job also. \n\nFor a little context my sister and me went through school in the same grade. We are both adopted from infancy from the state. Shes a tall natural blonde with blue eyes. I'm a short brunette with brown eyes. We are opposites in the full meaning. From middle school and up she got a lot of attention from boys and had a lot of girl friends. She was a cheerleader and all around popular girl. Which is fine. What wasnt fine was her constant bullying towards me. I was and still am an art nerd. I liked to be on my own mostly. I'm autistic and crowds just were never my thing. I also did matching band and JROTC. She used to help people throw rocks at my head when we would walk home from school. She started a rumor that I was pregnant our senior year. Theres a lot more that I don't want to discuss. She apologized for it when I moved out. I thought our relationship was on the mend. Until today.\n\nToday she had to get me from a work meeting because my boyfriend had the car at his work in a different city. We have one car because I dont drive. While in the car with her she asks how I've been feeling. I tell her I've been okay, but was still thinking about what she said and how it hurt my feelings. Her reply was she wanted us to be pregnant together because our childhood wasnt the best together and she wanted our kids to have a better relationship than we did. I reminded her that was her fault for being a bully to me growing up. She said I made it impossible to be nice to me because I was \"weird\". I asked what she meant and she basically said because I wasnt interested in the things she was, I was weird and deserved the bullying. I told her I did not want her to be pregnant anytime I was and I didnt want our kids growing up together.  I'm considering not letting her around my child. My boyfriend said he doesn't have an opinion,  and that if that's what I choose to do that's okay.\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1690336860, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/159sde4/aita_for_telling_my_sister_i_dont_want_her_being/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She can't MAKE your children be friends.Your children don't have to be around each other. Unless you force your child to be around this child that doesn't exist it really isn't a problem.

It's not entirely uncommon to not need a car - this obsession with everyone must drive is part of the problem - public transport exists, other people who drive exist. Not everyone needs to drive.\n\nI'll agree that I think it's a bit young to be getting pregnant and so on but people live different lives and have different outlooks for their lives that it's not immediately a bad decision.", ">You can be bullied by a sibling during childhood and still lean on them for personal things, certainly when as OP says in their post that the relationship is on the mend.\n\nIt's ok the mend but the sis said she deserves the bullying and OP said she doesn't want their kids growing up together and is contemplating cutting her out of her life completely.... That's some mend. \n\n>public transport exists, other people who drive exist. Not everyone needs to drive.\n\nThis is true. But if you have to take the bus to get around, you probably shouldn't be having kids. Sure you CAN but it's not an advised move, especially at 19.", "Wow elitist much? Can't have children if you use public transport, Jesus Christ, so much to unpack there that i just don't see you being worth the time.\n\nAnd good way of spinning what I said. Since you like your quotes here is the point I made about their OP thinking relationship on the mend and thus trusting her sister:\n\n>  She apologized for it when I moved out. I thought our relationship was on the mend. Until today.\n\nSo how about stop trying to be an elitist and spinning the conversation to suit your incredibly narrow worldview and admit you made a mistake and failed to read the post properly."]}
