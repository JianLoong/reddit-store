There bags shouldn\u2019t have been on your truck, so throwing them off of your truck is reasonable. Sounds like a great life lesson to me.", "NTA if anything you should sue the parents,  if that is a thing you can do. \n\nhow shitty of a parent are you,  where your kids doesn't respect other people's property,  and when you find out,  you get mad at the owner,  I know I kinda answered my own question,  but still. \n\nand it is not only kids. like how many videos is there on reddit iof people feeling entitled to one way or another interact with other peoples property without permission,  is there really that many that have shitty parents like this", "Dude, those kids were totally assholes. I mean, who the hell messes with someone's truck like that? And now their parent is trying to get you in trouble? That's some bullshit right there. You're definitely not the asshole in this situation.", "NTA.\n\nbut maybe you neednt have thrown their bags out of the back of the car. at least try not to get physical when kids are in the picture. you can also inform the parents and school about it as well.", "Good thing is if there is a video you have proof they were in your truck and vandalized it. \n\nThis mother does not have a case. \n\nI'd call the cops on those kids for trespassing and damage of property.

Instead of handling it like an adult, you let your anger take control.
