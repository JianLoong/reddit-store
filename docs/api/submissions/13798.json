My friend (18M) and I (18M) have been best mates since we were like 6. We used to do everything together and we've always been super close. For this reason he was the first (and so far only) person that I came out as gay to.\n\nWhen I told him it was all chill and he was super supportive and then we stopped talking about it. A few days later I saw him again and he started asking me a bunch of questions about it (mostly just curiosity stuff) and eventually he'd ask me if I'd ever go for him. I said no because he's my best mate and he's got a girlfriend, who I am also close with, but he kept pressing me for a different answer. Eventually I said that if I knew a guy like him who I didn't think of as a brother and who was single, that I'd go for it.\n\nFor the next few months he'd tease me relentlessly and one night he brought it up when we were both super drunk. On that night I made the mistake of letting him kiss me, and the next morning we had to have a very awkward conversation about why it was wrong and how he has a girlfriend etc. Not a huge deal and we agreed to keep it a secret but I still felt super duper shitty afterwards because I'm very close with his girlfriend.\n\nA couple weeks later he calls me saying they've broken up - supposedly he told her that he's attracted to guys and girls and she asked for a break (which I thought was weird because she's always been super chill). I invited him over to have some drinks with me and just chat to try and feel better. \n\nBefore long we were super drunk again and he opens up to me about how he's always had feelings for me deep down and he's just been trying to ignore them. The sad reality is that this is pretty much the truth for me as well - I've had feelings for him for a long time too. \n\nOne thing leads to another and he started to kiss me again. At first I protested saying he just broke up and he doesn't know what he's doing. He pretty much just said he knows what he's doing and tells me to relax. I'm drunk enough to let that happen and the next thing you know I'm down on my knees living out my longest running fantasy. \n\nHe spent the night, we got up to quite a bit of mischief and the next morning he left for work. I didn't hear from him much that night, but the very next night he texted me saying he and his girlfriend were back together and that what we did was a mistake. I reached out to her just to find out how things had been between them recently and she said they've been fine and asked me what was wrong. I've also asked him if they ever really broke up but he just keeps dodging the question or ignoring me \n\nNow I'm tossing up whether I should tell her what happened. I really want to because I like her and respect and I'm EXTREMELY pissed about the whole situation. But I'm also deep deep in the closet with a fairly conservative family in a very conservative area.

You\u2019ll have to decide that.

That\u2019s why we live in a time with so many issues, including being honest about sexuality, because people don\u2019t stand up and do what\u2019s right, they let others make their wrong choices and silently support them even when they disagree by doing nothing and going along with it.", "My guy, I have lost a friendship of almost 30 years due to a similar situation.  Your \"best friend\" does not give a shit about anyone but himself, and it will only become more apparent as time marches on.  Don't bother telling the gf, he will spin it into you coming onto him while he was incapacitated.

You were used, terribly. \n\nYou\u2019re also going to have to consider: you\u2019re close with her and yet you slept with her ex at the earliest possible moment. \n\nPersonally? I would take huge distance from them both. If you aren\u2019t yet out, and aren\u2019t willing to be, you need to walk away from the entire mess. \n\nBut at the end of the day this is less about sexuality and more about being a bad partner and a bad friend. A has used you and his gf. He has lied and been really slimy and you can expect continued behavior. Walk away. Be busy.", "You are NTA. This is such a complicated situation. On the one hand, she deserves to know that he cheated on her. On the other, outing someone before they are ready can be horrible. Either way, trust your gut to do what you think is best. This \u201cfriend\u201d put you in a bad position and prioritized his own self interest over both you and his gf. Keep that in mind before you let him back in your life.\n\nETA: I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Even without the gf in the picture, having someone make you feel safe enough to be intimate with them, only to break things off so suddenly, is a shitty feeling. Be sure to take care of yourself.", "**NTA**. You keep it to yourself and you keep yourself safe. \n\nWhat your friend did is a real asshole move. I know you guys have been friends your entire life, but you need to keep in the back of your mind always now when interacting with him that he's the kind of person who would lie to you like this, who would use and manipulate both you and his girlfriend, to get what he wants.\n\nJust because you're been friends for so long does not mean he automatically gets a pass to treat you like this. Childhood friends are funny- sometimes it's a lifelong bond, and sometimes it's a bond that happens because you both knew each other so long that it just seemed to make sense. You can't know which kind it is until you're older, but as you get older and expand your friend group and meet new people, it'll become clearer. \n\nYou're 18. Hopefully you're going to college next year, or you're in a position where you can move somewhere farther away and where it's safer to be yourself. You have an entire new world waiting for you out there. \n\nA lot of my friends have experiences similar to yours. Closeted best friends who kind of manipulated them into situations almost exactly like you describe here. It's not uncommon, especially in places that are so unsafe for young adults to express their sexuality that the only way they can do it is in situations like these. \n\nSo no, you are NTA. You do what you need to do to stay safe until a time when you can get out. But you also need to distance yourself from your friend.", "This is tough. You\u2019re all very young and unfortunately live somewhere where you aren\u2019t free to be yourselves. It could be that your friend is ricocheting between being honest about who he really is and then deep denial. What he did was really shitty but he\u2019s young and possibly in a moment of absolute personal chaos. If he was given the full freedom and support to just be who he is, I wonder where he\u2019d be right now? \n\nMy take is to put some space between you right now, tell him that you feel used and need some space. \n\nAnd get out of that town / area ASAP and somewhere where you can surround yourself with people who are not ashamed of who they are and won\u2019t shame you for who you are. \n\nMaybe the friendship can be salvaged. Unsure. \n\nUnfortunately for the gf, I don\u2019t think you can tell her without endangering yourself. Sucks all round. \n\nPerhaps you can tell your friend that he needs to do the right thing and let her go. \n\nBut you definitely are NTA and wouldn\u2019t be if you didn\u2019t tell in this instance. \n\nBig hugs!!", "NTA\u2026I would keep it to yourself for 6 mths at least.

What do you hope to gain from each course of action?\n\nTelling her. Would this be about alleviating your guilt or because you think she deserves to know he's willing to lie and manipulate to cheat on her.\n\nNot telling her. Is this to protect yourself and/or her. Do you intend to remain friends with either of them?\n\nEtc.\n\nI think yes it would make you an AH. However, you didn't make the bow of fidelity to his gf. Assuming they are monogamous, then when they decided to date he made the promise. He is the one that violated that.\n\nQuestion comes down to what do you do about your role? And don't misunderstand you can be an AH and be right. Like if telling her puts you at bodily risk, please by all means be an AH. Maybe you can figure out a way of letting her know he's been unfaithful in a different way, IDK.\n\nBut if it ever comes out in the future you will likely lose your friendship with her for not telling her. You may lose it if you do.\n\nThere might not be a win in this situation", "NTA. First he's not your friend. Friends don't use their friends to get physical satisfaction by lying and manipulating. Second he's a selfish asshole. He doesn't care about you and his gf. I would suggest to do your part: tell his gf and block him. What happens after that is his and her karma. I read your comment that you are buddies for 12 yrs and you feel he will come around but think what he's done. He didn't think about the 12 yrs while all his bs. Why are you thinking about it? It never too late to cut off toxic people from your life. It's not easy as it sounds but at the end your peace and mental health is important.", "NTA. This is majorly fucked up on your friend\u2019s part. Either way, whether or not you told is up to you, but keep in mind that your \u201cfriend\u201d might use this information as leverage against you, especially if you\u2019re afraid of your family finding out.

Don't get caught in it.", "NTA either way. Sorry, your friend is a major AH for lying, manipulating and using you for sex", "NTA, what he did was selfish and cruel to you both. He's not a good person at all.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your decision about whether to come out or not. You could always tell her that he told you in confidence that he\u2019s cheated on her. \n\nBut you should drop him. This guy is not your friend. He\u2019s probably in denial and in the closet, but that\u2019s not an excuse to lie and use people. He manipulated you into sex. You gave consent because you thought he was not in a relationship. But that\u2019s not true. He lied to achieve his goal and his goal was to get his rocks off with you, with absolutely no regard for your feelings or autonomy. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s in denial about his sexuality or dealing with internalized homophobia, all he had to do to be a good person is nothing. But he was incapable of even that.", "NTA but you need to distance yourself from this friend. He is lying to both you and his GF to take advantage of you both.

He\u2019s trying to have his cake and eat it too, but the reality is that he can\u2019t have you both. He lied to you so that you\u2019d hook up with him, which is manipulation at its finest. You and his (again, hopefully very soon ex) girlfriend should leave him to figure out his sexuality on his own. I\u2019m all for discovering who you are and who you want to love, but this is absolutely not the way to go about it. The only way you\u2019d be TA is if you kept all of this from her.

Your hopefully-ex \"friend\" is fifteen levels of asshole though.", "NTA at all, OP. It sounds like you trusted your friend and he took advantage of that trust. I'm very sorry.", "I don't think you'd be the AH either way. In most circumstances I'd say you should tell her the truth, but not if it means outing yourself and having to deal with the ramifications with your family. You tried being responsible and stopping things with your friend before they went further, and instead he's choosing to lie to his GF so he's definitely the AH. I know you've been friends for a long time, but you may want to reconsider his place on your life after putting you in such a difficult situation. NTA", "Well, I understand he's like a brother to you and you wouldn't want to mess up that relationship. \n\n But are you sure that this person respects you in the same manner? Be careful, be safe, and be honest with yourself and others.", "NTA. I'm sorry, but your best friend is a bad person. He played your emotions and took advantage of things. I don't know if telling his GF is the right call, honestly, but you might be doing her a favor if hes doing stuff like this to people, but that said, she may 'shoot the messenger' as it were, so proceed with caution, you know her better than strangers on the internet, obviously. This is a rough thing to carry, and plenty of us have been there. If its safer, keep it to yourself until you are somewhere physically and mentally where unpacking it is safe, but in the mean time, maybe find some resources so you don't have to deal with it alone 100%, a therapist, a friend you can trust, hell, even writing it down in a journal and sorting through your feelings on everything on your own can be helpful.\n\nIt's an awful situation, good luck.", "NTA, but I would definitely stop being friend with someone who finds so easy to manipulate people who loves them", "You should tell him that he has a certain amount of time to talk to his girlfriend about this, and if he doesn't in that amount of time, you'll tell her.", "NTA Because keeping this secret is about more than just the situation with his girlfriend. Revealing it would mean outing the both of you.\n\nWith that said, your friend lied to you big time, to essentially get you to do something you otherwise wouldn't have agreed to. You are now in the shittiest position ever. That's just unforgivable imo. Which sucks immensely coming from the guy you love, so.. Yeah I'm very sorry about that.\n\nImo, get away from him to take time to process that. And you wouldn't be an asshole for keeping the secret.", "Dude, imma be real, your friend just used you for sex. I'm not questioning whether his feelings were true or not, I'm saying that he used you for sex. And he most likely lied to his gf about it.", "NTA .. he is no longer your friend anymore.. a friend wouldn\u2019t do that to you. I\u2019m so sorry", "Nta. But before you do something. Have a serious talk with him first. He is forsure an asshole, no doubt about it, but so is everyone at one point in life. Talk to him and try to air everything out before deciding to cut him out completely.", "Goddamn, he did this all knowing you were trapped. What a selfish asshole. I don't know what you should do, but he definitely shouldn't be in your life anymore. I'm sorry.", "NTA. But you're both irl broke back mountain. Both having a secret life and desires. \n\nI hope for everyone's sake that you manage to come out and live your lives openly at some point.\n\nHowever, as shitty as what your bff did to you, as fucking painful and cruel it was, you do not get to out anyone. Not even him.  He cheated. He wants to hide for the rest of his miserable life. That's on him. You both know the truth.  If you tell her, that's only gonna get worst for everyone including you.", "NTA. \n\nI think you should ask her if they broke up earlier first to find out if he also lied about that since he was so dismissive of your question. That would make the situation much worse. It also might mean he never told her he was bisexual. \n\nYou\u2019re also the first guy he\u2019s been with and maybe he wanted to be with you because he had these feelings but then when it actually happened (you were both drunk and looser then normal) he regretted it and went back to her. Unfortunately lots of people, even gay people have internalized homophobia because of society and worry what life will be like and what others will think if they come out and have an actual relationship. \n\nThat being said, he could very well have just used you to figure out if he is really gay or wants to be with men, as you\u2019re a really close friend to him that is gay and since no one else knows, he might believe you would never tell anyone if he decided not to be with men (I say decided because he said he was bisexual, not because I think sexuality is a choice) \n\nIt is wrong that it happened, it is your choice if you tell her or not and I am not pushing you towards either choice. I simply want to give you information, possibilities, and thinks to consider before you make a choice. \n\nIf you tell her, you will be telling her you betrayed her and you will be outing yourself to her. As a result, your friendship most likely won\u2019t be the same with her, your friendship with him will most likely be ruined as well, and another important thing to think about is you haven\u2019t been ready to come out to anyone but him, but my coming out to her in this context, it is possible that you will be outed to a lot of others given the drama the situation might cause.", "Usually I'm a hardline \"tell the truth\" sort of person. But in this case, it's physically dangerous to you for your orientation to become known. And if your two friends break up (you seem pretty confident they would) there's no way the reason would be kept secret for long.

He's taken advantage of you once, there's a high chance he will do it again. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinal thought: he has blackmail material on you now. So do you on him, but his is possibly the more devastating, since he can truthfully say that you came out to him before everything went down, and can easily spin that to make himself the victim.

I think you should approach the situation carefully if you decide to tell her, and plan out what you\u2019re going to say. If you tell her, it should be in person and you should tell her you never meant to come between them or hurt anyone. You should also try to talk to him about it before you do because it sounds like he is scared or even maybe ashamed of who he is. He is figuring things out and this is probably a difficult journey for him, I honestly feel bad for him so try to be considerate of his feelings too. But she does have a right to know, just be careful because you never truly know how someone will react and he might try to twist the situation on you. Good luck to you!", "Since you're friends with her, you should tell her. But be prepared to lose him as a friend. Which is probably for the best. Either way you look at this, he is being shady about the situation, and not being fair to either you or his girl.", "NTA but I have a couple concerns that I wanted to bring forward. First, protect yourself. If you're in a situation where getting outed could be dangerous, don't do anything to put yourself in that situation.\n\nOn the other hand, you might not be the only person that your friend has cheated on his gf with. Did you use protection when you were together? If not, I would immediately get yourself tested and at that point, I would say it's probably more important to find a way to tell your friend's gf that she's been cheated on so she can get tested as well. Again, you might not be the only person he's cheated with. \n\nWould there be a way to tell her that her bf has cheated on her anonymously or through a third party? Also, if his gf breaks up with him over this, do you think he would out you for revenge? Just some things to consider.", "NTA and I urge you to maybe consider distancing yourself from your friend. From one queer person (24) to another, it's not your responsibility to help your friend through his journey. It's respectable if you decide you want to, but he emotionally manipulated you to have sex and his girlfriend doesn't realise. Your friend is on his own very confused situation and it's tough, but you deserve to look after yourself. You mentioned it's not safe to come out to others, so don't feel pressured to do anything that will put yourself in danger. However, I think it's worth seeing of his girlfriend is chill enough to tell her because your friend is going to end up hurting more people with how he's handling everything. He was drunk and is probably very confused about how he's feeling in general, but if you were a woman in that situation then it would be a no-brainer what to do. Don't let yourself be taken advantage of just because you're a closetted queer kid.", "Honestly I wouldn't tell her outright but if she asks then tell her. Here's the most important thing: if he'll cheat on her, he'll cheat on you too. People who are willing to cheat are ALWAYS willing to cheat. Keep that in mind. I'd just stay friends with him.", "NTA either way, BUT you do need to realize that sharing the truth with his GF *will*, I repeat *will*, almost unequivocally, be the end of your friendship with him. (I mean you probably shouldn't want to be friends with him anymore anyway, but I understand that complicated feelings are complicated, especially for LGBTQ, especially considering how young you are and that the relationship between you and him could still potentially develop in the future. But you shouldn't give him that benefit of the doubt, friend.) It would (should) likely be the end of their relationship, which he will definitely blame you for, given he's already shown you his true colors as a liar and emotional manipulator. You also need to consider the possibility of him retaliating by outing you to your friends/family, which could work in his favor as it would likely lead to you being viewed by said conservative asshats as a deviant and liar (not how I think, ofc, but I know how *those people* think and you know I'm right.) So when you'd try to come back with \"yeah and he tried to fuck me\" it probably wouldn't be believed. So in that light, if you do decide to go to her with the truth, I'd recommend telling at least a few close friends beforehand, if not his family and/or yours, so as to deny him that possibility.", "I personally don't think that it is up to you to tell her. They were broken up at the time and you did nothing wrong.", "You're won't be the asshole either way, and I hope you'll figure this out yourself. But you've been used OP. He lied to you about his break up and used your \"crush\" against you. He got you drunk and coerced you into \"acts\". This is not the way friends act. I'd ditch the \"friend\" and tell the girl.\nIf you think that ANY of that will put you in danger, just lean away from the friend and leave the whole situation.\nI'm sorry this happened to you OP.", "What would you do if his gf was actually his bf and he made up a break up story to hook up with you? Would you keep it to yourself? Whatever you would do in that situation is what you should do in this. Her gender does not matter.   \n\n\nHe is a twerp for feeding into the stereotype what it means to be bisexual. We can be just as monogamous as anyone. People aren\u2019t cake and ice cream, we don\u2019t need both. If he wants to explore this side of himself, great. But he owes it to be honest with her, she has a right to do her own exploration at the same time. Even if all she is searching for is someone faithful.", "Conservative leaning here. I would keep it to yourself. Your mate is obviously confused. Just let things play out with him and don't push a situation that could drastically change both of your lives permanently. \n\nNTA.", "YTA. If you\u2019re as close to this girl and you say you are then you have a responsibility to tell her the truth. There\u2019s nothing wrong with your friend being confused and all over the place with his emotions but it is incredibly disrespectful and irresponsible to play with two different peoples emotions just because he can\u2019t decide what he wants. \n\nHe is not your friend anymore, he\u2019s shown you how little he cares for your emotions. He\u2019s also shown how little he actually respects the relationship he had with his gf. Set things right by telling the truth and find a best friend worthy of your trust.", "NTA. It's a difficult situation and I understand you feeling guilty and respecting her and not wanting to keep it a secret, but it also wasn't your responsibility. You're still in the closet and you're unsure how your family/wider area would react if word got out that you're gay; that combined with the fact that people sometimes shoot the messenger mean it's understandable for you to keep it to yourself, at least for your own safety.\n\nSad truth is a lot of people don't realise how much hate crime and violence does still exist even in quite generally-accepting cities and countries, so I won't judge anyone for putting their personal safety and home life first above telling someone a secret they, yes, deserve to know, but isn't your obligation to tell. Your \"friend\" should've had enough respect for his girlfriend to tell her the truth so she can make an informed decision about getting back with him. And make no mistake, he isn't a good friend to you either.", "Dude, drop these people and don\u2019t talk to either ever again. Chalk it up to a life lesson in learning who to be intimate with and who not to. \u201cStraight\u201d guys that need to be drunk to fool around probably have a high percentage of this kind of behavior (it\u2019s not gay if I\u2019m drunk). You owe it to yourself to be treated better than this. NTA unless you keep them in your life.", "Oh darlin I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in this position.  You\u2019re NTA, this is one of those occasions were I wouldn\u2019t tell the gf because of the backlash it could cause you. But I would start to ice out that friend of yours. He lied, manipulated, and used you, and you deserve so much more. He threw away 12yrs of friendship for his own selfishness. I wouldn\u2019t do it cold turkey cause he could be vicious about it, but definitely start pulling back and start hanging with a new circle.", "NTA. Your friend is a massive one though. He cheated on her and he used you. I'd never trust him again if I were you.", "NTA and your friend is a closeted mess. He absolutely manipulated you and he also is confused with himself. If he can only do it when he\u2019s drunk it\u2019s bc he\u2019s bottling everything in. No matter how long you\u2019ve been friends, this friendship could only work once he\u2019s open and honest about himself sober. You and the gf are both being mistreated by him. It\u2019s better to protect yourself at this time. Especially knowing that your family might abandoned you for being gay. You gotta think about you.", "I'm not going to judge you. Your friend is obviously very conflicted with his sexuality. That does not excuse him from being shitty to you, but you should never out someone.", "NTA, he seems to have used you to get his rocks off and then carried on with his outwardly straight public life.\n\nFor no other reason than to protect your own ass since you say you're very much in the closet, I wouldn't tell gf at this point. She may be chill but the \"woman scorned\" trope exists for a reason.\n\nBut I would also work to put some distance between you going forward.", "NTA because it's self preservation given your family/area.\n\nBut frankly... He's not your friend. He used you after lying to you. He's probably also lying to himself, but that's his problem, not yours. Don't compromise your mental equilibrium by keeping him as your friend because you can't have him as your boyfriend, please. \n\nDistance yourself from him and try to move away to more accepting areas. I see the start of Brokeback mountain in your current situation, and it's sad. .", "NTA, but I really hope you drop him as a friend. I know you guys have known each other for a long time but he took advantage of you while you were drunk. He knew what he was doing. Whether him and his gf were together or not during that time doesn\u2019t even matter at this point. He used you for his own pleasure and curiosity and then threw you to the curb.

I'm very proud of the way you feel about this.   You being concerned about the girl friends feelings I think is a good sign of your character.  Good job.  I think the instinct to tell her is a good one that you should almost always listen to.  It sounds to me like what he did was possibly cheating.  You maybe feel guilty about the kissing and I think sex as well you didn't explicitly say.  He is the one that is lying to that girl.  You need to protect yourself at this point.   This is not the right time to come out of the closet.   There will be a lot of extra emotions flying around regarding his infidelity.

Secondly, this guy has a not a good friend to you or a good boyfriend to your female friend. He cheated on her, plain and simple.\n\nI\u2019ve been the girl that was cheated on, and I would want to know. She may not believe you. The guy may make up lies about you. I would be fully transparent and show her any texts that may help verify your story. \n\nIt sounds like your friend is very confused right now. It\u2019s fine for him to want to figure himself out, but they way he went about it was 100% wrong.", "NTA, technically he didn\u2019t cheat bc y\u2019all did stuff while they were broken up and yes he shouldn\u2019t have kissed you before but I\u2019ll give him the benefit of been a dumb teenager and discovering his sexuality with his best friend and such. But don\u2019t think you should tell her, kinda of unnecessary", "I think no matter what this is going to be a learning experience for you. Being 18 and trying to figure things out, especially sexuality, is brutal.

You need to protect yourself first.", "You are not the asshole either way. I found myself in almost the same situation but I was a couple years older than you. This is impossible. I came from a small conservative town with a family that had expectations of me having a \u201cnormal\u201d family. This was for me almost impossible to navigate. In the end distance from the small town and a chance to experience who I really was in a more tolerant environment made all of the difference for me. I know it sucks you all are younger and worlds a little smaller while you are still constantly surrounded by the people you grew up with. \n   You need to do what keeps you safe first.

I just wanted to say that it sounds to me like your friend is very confused about his sexuality, especially considering your ages.  The way he\u2019s treating you and his gf is obviously not right, but it sounds like he\u2019s going through some shit and has a lot of soul searching to do.  Maybe he\u2019s really gay, but scared?  Maybe he saw a safe person in you to explore his feelings?  I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably best for you to keep some distance between these two until he figures himself out.  I wouldn\u2019t tell the gf though.  I know in a way that, yes, maybe she does deserve to know, but I\u2019m sure it would be devastating to her to feel like she was betrayed by both her bf and her friend.  You can\u2019t change what happened.  Just keep it between you two and spare her the hurt feelings.", "NTA - but contrary to the popular opinion here, I feel like your friend might be new to discovering this side of him and might be in denial. I do agree that he needn\u2019t have lied and that you don\u2019t need to be a therapist to him as he figures himself out. \n\nI would say that a 12 year friendship deserves some conversation about this where you\u2019re upfront about your feelings & ask him why he would lie to you etc. Take it from there.\n\nRomantically/ sexually, distance from him and see other people.", "NTA. But I\u2019d also consider keeping this to yourself because I\u2019d you tell the truth, your \u201cfriend\u201d will turn this on you.

She is still likely super chill about those of an LGBTQ+ persuasion.\n\nIf the story you've been told is true, what's probably running through her mind at that point, is that she's just had her boyfriend tell her that he's interested in more than just her, which she needs time to figure out whether or not it's worth sticking around for him to maybe choose to stay with her, or whether he's likely to go and do something like he's done with you.\n\nWhich, from your story; seems like he's completely capable of.\n\nThe weird thing is that you're not cutting this guy out completely.
