My friend (18M) and I (18M) have been best mates since we were like 6. We used to do everything together and we've always been super close. For this reason he was the first (and so far only) person that I came out as gay to.\n\nWhen I told him it was all chill and he was super supportive and then we stopped talking about it. A few days later I saw him again and he started asking me a bunch of questions about it (mostly just curiosity stuff) and eventually he'd ask me if I'd ever go for him. I said no because he's my best mate and he's got a girlfriend, who I am also close with, but he kept pressing me for a different answer. Eventually I said that if I knew a guy like him who I didn't think of as a brother and who was single, that I'd go for it.\n\nFor the next few months he'd tease me relentlessly and one night he brought it up when we were both super drunk. On that night I made the mistake of letting him kiss me, and the next morning we had to have a very awkward conversation about why it was wrong and how he has a girlfriend etc. Not a huge deal and we agreed to keep it a secret but I still felt super duper shitty afterwards because I'm very close with his girlfriend.\n\nA couple weeks later he calls me saying they've broken up - supposedly he told her that he's attracted to guys and girls and she asked for a break (which I thought was weird because she's always been super chill). I invited him over to have some drinks with me and just chat to try and feel better. \n\nBefore long we were super drunk again and he opens up to me about how he's always had feelings for me deep down and he's just been trying to ignore them. The sad reality is that this is pretty much the truth for me as well - I've had feelings for him for a long time too. \n\nOne thing leads to another and he started to kiss me again. At first I protested saying he just broke up and he doesn't know what he's doing. He pretty much just said he knows what he's doing and tells me to relax. I'm drunk enough to let that happen and the next thing you know I'm down on my knees living out my longest running fantasy. \n\nHe spent the night, we got up to quite a bit of mischief and the next morning he left for work. I didn't hear from him much that night, but the very next night he texted me saying he and his girlfriend were back together and that what we did was a mistake. I reached out to her just to find out how things had been between them recently and she said they've been fine and asked me what was wrong. I've also asked him if they ever really broke up but he just keeps dodging the question or ignoring me \n\nNow I'm tossing up whether I should tell her what happened. I really want to because I like her and respect and I'm EXTREMELY pissed about the whole situation. But I'm also deep deep in the closet with a fairly conservative family in a very conservative area.

You\u2019ll have to decide that.

That\u2019s why we live in a time with so many issues, including being honest about sexuality, because people don\u2019t stand up and do what\u2019s right, they let others make their wrong choices and silently support them even when they disagree by doing nothing and going along with it.", "My guy, I have lost a friendship of almost 30 years due to a similar situation.  Your \"best friend\" does not give a shit about anyone but himself, and it will only become more apparent as time marches on.  Don't bother telling the gf, he will spin it into you coming onto him while he was incapacitated.

You were used, terribly. \n\nYou\u2019re also going to have to consider: you\u2019re close with her and yet you slept with her ex at the earliest possible moment. \n\nPersonally? I would take huge distance from them both. If you aren\u2019t yet out, and aren\u2019t willing to be, you need to walk away from the entire mess. \n\nBut at the end of the day this is less about sexuality and more about being a bad partner and a bad friend. A has used you and his gf. He has lied and been really slimy and you can expect continued behavior. Walk away. Be busy.", "You are NTA. This is such a complicated situation. On the one hand, she deserves to know that he cheated on her. On the other, outing someone before they are ready can be horrible. Either way, trust your gut to do what you think is best. This \u201cfriend\u201d put you in a bad position and prioritized his own self interest over both you and his gf. Keep that in mind before you let him back in your life.\n\nETA: I\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Even without the gf in the picture, having someone make you feel safe enough to be intimate with them, only to break things off so suddenly, is a shitty feeling. Be sure to take care of yourself.", "**NTA**. You keep it to yourself and you keep yourself safe. \n\nWhat your friend did is a real asshole move. I know you guys have been friends your entire life, but you need to keep in the back of your mind always now when interacting with him that he's the kind of person who would lie to you like this, who would use and manipulate both you and his girlfriend, to get what he wants.\n\nJust because you're been friends for so long does not mean he automatically gets a pass to treat you like this. Childhood friends are funny- sometimes it's a lifelong bond, and sometimes it's a bond that happens because you both knew each other so long that it just seemed to make sense. You can't know which kind it is until you're older, but as you get older and expand your friend group and meet new people, it'll become clearer. \n\nYou're 18. Hopefully you're going to college next year, or you're in a position where you can move somewhere farther away and where it's safer to be yourself. You have an entire new world waiting for you out there. \n\nA lot of my friends have experiences similar to yours. Closeted best friends who kind of manipulated them into situations almost exactly like you describe here. It's not uncommon, especially in places that are so unsafe for young adults to express their sexuality that the only way they can do it is in situations like these. \n\nSo no, you are NTA. You do what you need to do to stay safe until a time when you can get out. But you also need to distance yourself from your friend.", "This is tough. You\u2019re all very young and unfortunately live somewhere where you aren\u2019t free to be yourselves. It could be that your friend is ricocheting between being honest about who he really is and then deep denial. What he did was really shitty but he\u2019s young and possibly in a moment of absolute personal chaos. If he was given the full freedom and support to just be who he is, I wonder where he\u2019d be right now? \n\nMy take is to put some space between you right now, tell him that you feel used and need some space. \n\nAnd get out of that town / area ASAP and somewhere where you can surround yourself with people who are not ashamed of who they are and won\u2019t shame you for who you are. \n\nMaybe the friendship can be salvaged. Unsure. \n\nUnfortunately for the gf, I don\u2019t think you can tell her without endangering yourself. Sucks all round. \n\nPerhaps you can tell your friend that he needs to do the right thing and let her go. \n\nBut you definitely are NTA and wouldn\u2019t be if you didn\u2019t tell in this instance. \n\nBig hugs!!", "NTA\u2026I would keep it to yourself for 6 mths at least. You\u2019re 18 and relationships change a lot at that age. Keep your distance for awhile and remember that you have all the control of when your story is revealed.", "Question. What do you hope to gain from each course of action?\n\nTelling her. Would this be about alleviating your guilt or because you think she deserves to know he's willing to lie and manipulate to cheat on her.\n\nNot telling her. Is this to protect yourself and/or her. Do you intend to remain friends with either of them?\n\nEtc.\n\nI think yes it would make you an AH. However, you didn't make the bow of fidelity to his gf. Assuming they are monogamous, then when they decided to date he made the promise. He is the one that violated that.\n\nQuestion comes down to what do you do about your role? And don't misunderstand you can be an AH and be right. Like if telling her puts you at bodily risk, please by all means be an AH. Maybe you can figure out a way of letting her know he's been unfaithful in a different way, IDK.\n\nBut if it ever comes out in the future you will likely lose your friendship with her for not telling her. You may lose it if you do.\n\nThere might not be a win in this situation", "NTA. First he's not your friend. Friends don't use their friends to get physical satisfaction by lying and manipulating. Second he's a selfish asshole. He doesn't care about you and his gf. I would suggest to do your part: tell his gf and block him. What happens after that is his and her karma. I read your comment that you are buddies for 12 yrs and you feel he will come around but think what he's done. He didn't think about the 12 yrs while all his bs. Why are you thinking about it? It never too late to cut off toxic people from your life. It's not easy as it sounds but at the end your peace and mental health is important.", "NTA. This is majorly fucked up on your friend\u2019s part. Either way, whether or not you told is up to you, but keep in mind that your \u201cfriend\u201d might use this information as leverage against you, especially if you\u2019re afraid of your family finding out.

Don't get caught in it.", "NTA either way. Sorry, your friend is a major AH for lying, manipulating and using you for sex", "NTA, what he did was selfish and cruel to you both. He's not a good person at all.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s your decision about whether to come out or not. You could always tell her that he told you in confidence that he\u2019s cheated on her. \n\nBut you should drop him. This guy is not your friend. He\u2019s probably in denial and in the closet, but that\u2019s not an excuse to lie and use people. He manipulated you into sex. You gave consent because you thought he was not in a relationship. But that\u2019s not true. He lied to achieve his goal and his goal was to get his rocks off with you, with absolutely no regard for your feelings or autonomy. It doesn\u2019t matter if he\u2019s in denial about his sexuality or dealing with internalized homophobia, all he had to do to be a good person is nothing. But he was incapable of even that.", "NTA but you need to distance yourself from this friend. He is lying to both you and his GF to take advantage of you both.

He\u2019s trying to have his cake and eat it too, but the reality is that he can\u2019t have you both. He lied to you so that you\u2019d hook up with him, which is manipulation at its finest. You and his (again, hopefully very soon ex) girlfriend should leave him to figure out his sexuality on his own. I\u2019m all for discovering who you are and who you want to love, but this is absolutely not the way to go about it. The only way you\u2019d be TA is if you kept all of this from her.

That's something you'd do if you were giddy and just wanted to tell people you finally got some with your terrible best friend.\n\nYou need to step away from toxic people, before they engulf you and you become completely toxic too.", "ESH. \n\nN-T-A for keeping yourself safe in a conservative community (been there).  And I understand there were lies and alcohol, so I don't blame you exactly for not being wiser about what a bad idea this hookup was. \n\nBut I do ask you to consider your friend's (the girlfriend's) well being here.  If she's being cheated on, her health is now at risk.  She deserves to know that so she can protect herself.  Even if you are STI-free, OP, it doesn't mean everyone else he's cheating with is, too.  (And you also need to get tested in six weeks, three months, and six months, because it doesn't sound like safer sex was practiced between you two, and we know he's untrustworthy.)\n\nGood luck, OP.", "Keep it to yourself. Use the situation as leverage to get a cushy/high paying job if he ever becomes a ceo or something like that", "First and foremost, I am sorry that your so called friend has behaved badly towards you. However, don\u2019t tell his girlfriend. His sexuality will eventually come to light. Let me warn you. He will be back and try to set you up as his side piece or dirty little secret. Don\u2019t allow him to do this to you because right now your emotions are raw. Go no contact with him and his girlfriend. Let her wonder why you no longer speak to him. If you stay in contact with her he will get to you through her. Protect yourself and move on to your own happiness.", "Honestly it's a really complicated situation and I don't think there's any one right or wrong answer. Ultimately I think you should do what is best for you. No one else can definitively tell you if YTA or not because that's a subjective thing depending on personal morality, and it's difficult in this situation.\n\nThe girlfriend probably deserves to know but it shouldn't have to come at your expense. If it's safe to do, you could maybe drop subtle hints cluing to his infidelity without mentioning anything outright. \n\nImo the best course of action might be doing whatever it takes to keep your secret safe especially if coming out can harm you. I know it can be really hard to lose friends but I feel like it might be best to at least start distancing yourself from the couple if you don't want to cut ties entirely. Going no contact would ofc be best. \n\nStaying the same might start making you feel guilty (which is shitty as hell) or your friend might try the same bullshit again, especially when you're drunk. Ultimately it's up to you but keeping the status quo is probably only going to end up doing more harm than good.\n\nSad as it is, people come and go. Especially with childhood friends. Sometimes they aren't meant to stay beyond a certain part of your life and that's ok. What you had was good until it wasn't and maybe it's time to move on now. That's just part of growing up I think. \n\nGood luck OP. I hope everything works out ok for you :)", "I\u2019m lost in all these acronyms, but I know one, and that\u2019s Not The Asshole, which is you. You were literally used for sex once he learned of your sexuality. \n\nThis is basically the plot of Heartstopper. If you haven\u2019t seen that on Netflix, WATCH IT. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udec2 and I hope you do have a therapist or the ability to talk to a professional.", "Wow\u2026 this sucks. I\u2019m sorry that you had to experience this OP. It\u2019s not fair and it\u2019s disgusting that your \u201cfriend\u201d thought this was totally ok. \n\nI have a hard time judging this because I do think gf needs to know. It\u2019s not fair that she is going to live life with this guy assuming he\u2019s not going behind her back to use and abuse others. And if I was the gf I\u2019d want to know and admire you for being brave enough and respecting me enough to let me know. \n\nBUT I know not everyone would see it that way and you do need to think about your safety. It\u2019s not a guarantee either way you look at it and that\u2019s just as dangerous. \n\nJust remember if you don\u2019t tell her and she finds out, regardless - all respect and admiration she had for you is out the window and she\u2019d probably be more likely to out you in that situation. \n\nI think in terms of telling her it\u2019s important to keep your safety at the top of the priority list. I would probably me more apt to tell her but I\u2019m also not in your position OP. and for that I\u2019d say nta \n\nBut I do think she should know. I hate it. Best of luck op! Please dump your \u201cfriend\u201d. He\u2019s gross and has no place using and abusing people around him. He\u2019ll just keep doing it - not caring who he hurts in the process.", "This is really hard for me. At the time of typing this I still haven't decided on my answer.   \n\n\nyou're good friends with both of them.. personally the thing for me here is, you with slept with your friends boyfriend. that's your part in this whole thing.   \n\n\nI know it's super complicated because of the feelings and the the double friendship and the whole closeted homosexuality/conservative area thing..  but when you see past all of that, you  say you're close and you respect her, but you slept with her boyfriend. if this was about you sleeping with her, you know exactly how people would feel about you sleeping with your best friends girl right? So the question is how much less bad is it now that you slept with your <how close are you actually?> friend's boyfriend.   \n\n\nIn the end here, she's a friend, and you slept with her boyfriend, and sleeping with a friends boyfriend regardless of anything else is a crappy thing to do in most cases. at this point I say ESH. you and him are fairly equal thing here.   \n\n\nhaving said all of that - go for it man. yes you guys did a not so great thing but shit sometimes in this life you gotta be an AH to get what you deserve. if you're being honest about how you've felt and so is he it seems to me you guys owe it to eachother to go for it, and I would hope that she could understand despite how much it would obviously hurt.   \n\n\ni'm not changing my vote - despite how much I think you should still go for it, there was a better way to go about it than getting hammered and having an affair.   \n\n\nBEST OF LUCK TO YOU BOTH", "Your friend is gay as fuck and too afraid to be real. Considering your area and parents. Your 18. You\u2019ll have more lovers and better friends. Just keep living your life as honest as you can. \n\nI\u2019d I tell the girlfriend. But be prepared to lose both of those friends.", "Sorry to be suuuuper unhelpful\n\nBut you're so fucked my man", "I want to make it clear that this situation is without a doubt, a dillema. and there's a lot of ethical questions about either decission. in telling her you do kind of out them and I can't imagine that's what you want, but he did cheat on her, and is using you in a way. I believe that you do have something of a moral oppurtunity to tell her. he did something wrong, and he's hurting you, and though she doesn't know it yet, his girlfriend. but make no mistake, I don't imagine he'll just take it lying down, and it's going to take work after this if you want to salvage a relationship, of any kind, with him, and possibly even with her. to conclude, I'd say NTA. I truly hope this turns out for the best if you do decide to go through with it.", "NTA but you need to ask yourself this:\n\n\nIs someone who tells you that he has feelings for you and then claims it was just a mistake someone you want to be friends with?\n\n\nI hate to say this but he used you. He might have been a good friend for over a decade, but this was huge asshole behaviour.", "YTA, you know he just cheated with you and you refuse to tell his partner who you are supposedly \"close\" to.", "Girl, don't do it. It may be tempting to get revenge or to make sure that she knows what's going on, but if you tell her about that it's going to blow up in your face. Everybody's going to know who and what you are. If you're not prepared to come out just keep your mouth shut for now.", "When I caught my sister making out with a guy that wasn't her boyfriend, I told her she could either tell her boyfriend or break up with her boyfriend.  Otherwise, I would tell him myself.  She broke up with him and I thought she learned a valuable lesson as a high school kid.  She did cheated on her fiance 10 years later and dumped him, so I don't know if I really taught her the right lesson.  You are definitely NTA.  I think your friend sounds confused, but is still the AH.", "This is absolutely correct. OP, there are a lot of people encouraging you to tell her, but you have to put your own safety first. It\u2019s awful, but he\u2019s the one who put everyone in this position, so it\u2019ll be his fault if he cheats again and she finds out, for example.", "I\u2019m so sorry he did this to you. Please don\u2019t give him the opportunity to do it to you again. \n\nNTA and you wouldn\u2019t be for keeping this to yourself. You don\u2019t owe anyone that piece of information.", "op you need to reevaluate your friendship with him. he\u2019s already shown you he\u2019s a dishonest person at least twice, and has no problems lying to someone he cares about to manipulate them. i\u2019m not sure he has the integrity or loyalty you can depend on to keep your secret.", "As someone who lost a friend of almost 10 years over them being manipulative, gaslighting me, and poor decisions regarding sex trust this internet stranger. You're better off without him. If he did it once, he would do it again. \nHe will use your love and history against you. And make you feel like YOU'RE the crazy one. But ..... in your he, d you have to reframe it. YOU are not ending/throwing away a friendship. HE broke the friendship. As yourself some questions... Can you trust him? Are you ok with who YOU would be if/when she finds out if you stay? And because I am a cynic, what if he holds this over you? \n It's a sticky situation, and it won't get better for you unless you do some soul searching. Maybe he will see loosing you as a reason to wake up and work on himself. But that is not your problem. \n\nWork on yourself, find others who you can trust, get involved in some queer community.

You should give some thought to getting out of there to someplace you can be you, and you can more easily find like-minded friends who won't let you down. \n\nI'm not discounting how hard that can be, but that kind of goal is worth working towards.", "That\u2019s something to consider here. He\u2019s absolutely the AH but consider your piece here. You\u2019re close with his gf and yet you barely hesitated to sleep with him immediately following their breakup. Some self reflection is needed here. \n\nKnow I\u2019m not saying you are the AH. But at the end of the day, I wouldn\u2019t consider that an act of friendship either you know?

To suggest he out himself could be dangerous on numerous levels. It\u2019s self preservation, NOT selfishness. OP NTA if you decide to keep this to yourself. (Or tell her anonymously somehow?)

However, if down the road to feel the need to tell her, doooooooo it.", "It\u2019s self interested, but not selfish. They have a perfectly realistic reason to not want this to get out of hand and inadvertently out themself. Self interest is not inherently wrong and frankly more people need to develop the courage to really weigh whether a situation is a good place to be altruistic and selfless or if they should protect themselves. Caring for and helping others is a great thing, but it shouldn\u2019t be done mindlessly and it\u2019s not wrong to want to avoid potentially serious risks to one\u2019s safety", "I get that he feels obligated to tell the girlfriend, but he\u2019s got to think of himself and his situation first.
