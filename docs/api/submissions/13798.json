My friend (18M) and I (18M) have been best mates since we were like 6. We used to do everything together and we've always been super close. For this reason he was the first (and so far only) person that I came out as gay to.\n\nWhen I told him it was all chill and he was super supportive and then we stopped talking about it. A few days later I saw him again and he started asking me a bunch of questions about it (mostly just curiosity stuff) and eventually he'd ask me if I'd ever go for him. I said no because he's my best mate and he's got a girlfriend, who I am also close with, but he kept pressing me for a different answer. Eventually I said that if I knew a guy like him who I didn't think of as a brother and who was single, that I'd go for it.\n\nFor the next few months he'd tease me relentlessly and one night he brought it up when we were both super drunk. On that night I made the mistake of letting him kiss me, and the next morning we had to have a very awkward conversation about why it was wrong and how he has a girlfriend etc. Not a huge deal and we agreed to keep it a secret but I still felt super duper shitty afterwards because I'm very close with his girlfriend.\n\nA couple weeks later he calls me saying they've broken up - supposedly he told her that he's attracted to guys and girls and she asked for a break (which I thought was weird because she's always been super chill). I invited him over to have some drinks with me and just chat to try and feel better. \n\nBefore long we were super drunk again and he opens up to me about how he's always had feelings for me deep down and he's just been trying to ignore them. The sad reality is that this is pretty much the truth for me as well - I've had feelings for him for a long time too. \n\nOne thing leads to another and he started to kiss me again. At first I protested saying he just broke up and he doesn't know what he's doing. He pretty much just said he knows what he's doing and tells me to relax. I'm drunk enough to let that happen and the next thing you know I'm down on my knees living out my longest running fantasy. \n\nHe spent the night, we got up to quite a bit of mischief and the next morning he left for work. I didn't hear from him much that night, but the very next night he texted me saying he and his girlfriend were back together and that what we did was a mistake. I reached out to her just to find out how things had been between them recently and she said they've been fine and asked me what was wrong. I've also asked him if they ever really broke up but he just keeps dodging the question or ignoring me \n\nNow I'm tossing up whether I should tell her what happened. I really want to because I like her and respect and I'm EXTREMELY pissed about the whole situation. But I'm also deep deep in the closet with a fairly conservative family in a very conservative area.

I think it's a super awful situation, so I wouldn't blame you either way. I think if I was her I would want to know, but you also don't deserve all the backlash you could get from this blowing up in your face.

Imagine if she found out later and felt like you had been acting like a fake, backstabbing friend this whole time.", "NTA If you kept this to yourself.

If he's a good friend, and you have been best friends since 6 so hopefully he is, he won't be able to dodge this with you for very long.\n\nI'd confront him and tell him he needs to come clean with his gf or you will.

Especially since you\u2019re close to her too. Be prepared though.. she is probably going to be a storm of angry or sad or both. \n\nHe used you and your feelings for him. Even if this guy is confused and maybe having trouble coming out, that is no excuse to lie to his best friend, manipulate you and then turn around and act like it\u2019s no big deal.", "NTA, but remember that for some people they've got to suck a dick to realize they don't like sucking dick.", "NTA. Unfortunately I think you'll come off worse in this situation. They could always sort things out and he could explain it as a mistake but you'd never be able to take cover in that closet to protect you from undeserved judgement or hate from other people around you. Take it as a learning experience and look after yourself. Good luck.", "NTA, but your friend seems like he is. Why is he avoiding the question of if they ever really broke up?

If you rely on your parents and you know they won\u2019t support you if they found out your sexuality, it might be better to tread carefully. \n\nMorally, YWNBTA. If this were a just world, absolutely you should tell his gf. \n\nBut people are fucked up, and your friend is one of them. And idk if you can trust the gf, even if you\u2019re close. Better confidants have revealed worse secrets. I also don\u2019t know if you\u2019re able to deny allegations convincingly. \n\nI\u2019m not commanding you to keep silent.

Guy is toying with you and her.", "Damn this dude is all over the fucking place. You might not be the only side piece and if you\u2019re trying to avoid drama, it\u2019s going to be a shitload worse once she finds out from someone else.\n\nWould she be the type to out you to your family?", "That's definitely something I'll have to think about as well. On one hand I want to encourage him to tell her but I know that if he does the rumours will start to spread - she's a good person but this would definitely cross a line for her. It's a shame because I don't want to lose either of them as friends", "Yeah you're definitely right and I'm probably going to be super pissed at him for a long time", "Yeah my logical brain agrees with you, but my emotional brain is telling me I've been best buddies with this dude for 12 years and that has to count for something", "Thanks that's reassuring to hear. And yeah he was always a bit of a player before he met his girlfriend. Now that I think about it I can't believe I let him play me that easily", "That's definitely what I want to do but I also don't want to out myself and I'm like 99% sure that's how that story would end. I guess I'm just trying to weigh up if it's worth it", "Yeah I know he did a really really shitty thing. I'm still having weirdly mixed feelings about it all though", "Haha it's funny you should mention that. I had the distinct impression that this wasn't a problem for him", "This isn\u2019t a sitcom omg. If someone betrays your trust so deeply there\u2019s NO WAY OP should EVER accept any sort of relationship with him, whether poly or mono.\n\nIdc if the friend is \u201cfinding himself,\u201d he put OP in a vulnerable position and then ghosted. \n\nMaybe years down the line (and years of therapy, AND a sincere apology) y\u2019all can be friends again. But thinking of a relationship in this delicate time is not it.", "I'm not sure if he even wants to open up. I'm not really sure what to think at all at the moment. It's funny you should mention the throuple thing because I'd be lying if I said I haven't thought about it before. I'm starting to wonder if he's doing this behind her back a lot though, and then obviously she deserves better", "Yeah, no. \n\nDude is a NIGHTMARE. He can\u2019t be trusted! \n\nOP needs to run far and fast.", "I genuinely believed they were broken up at the time and we haven't done anything since", "You want to be friends with a selfish lying cheater who purposely hurts and manipulates the people he\u2019s close with? You should aim higher for better friends who have at least a shred of integrity. You\u2019re ok with her boyfriend cheating on her, so would you be ok with yours cheating on you? Do you cheat in relationships as well?", "he was your friend. but he definitely should not be now. especially after doing this to you. nta.", "You should be even angrier that your friend of 12 years lied to you, used you for sex, and probably did so knowing you couldn't rat him out to his girlfriend without outing yourself. He's a manipulative, shitty person.", "It does count for something, it counts for a lot. Unfortunately it sounds like it counts MORE for you than it does him. \n\nI know it's the cliche answer, but you should try to distance & remove yourself from this person. They've shown you their true selves and it's not pretty. \n\nConsidering his power over you (emotionally and with your secret), there's nothing stopping a person like this from continuing to abuse you. You need to protect yourself. \n\nStay safe, NTA.", "No, it should have *counted more to him* \n\n*he* didn't need to lie, or sexually manipulate you.\nBut he did. \nAnd if someone's willing to once,\ntheir always capable of doing it again. I'm sorry.", "You also have to consider if he will continue to try play you every time you get drunk togethet", "Is the gf not aware that you're gay?", "Completely understandable. You said in your post that you have had feelings for him for a while now. Unfortunately, when people hurt us, as much as we wish we would hate them instantly, it rarely works that way.

You don\u2019t need someone In your life who treats you like a test subject.", "I know this is absolutely not the point of your post but now I want details", "I've never had a relationship but I'd never ever do something like that. I'm not okay with what he did either and as much as it will suck to lose a 12 year old friendship I can't stay close to him knowing what I know. I really feel like I should tell her but I'm worried about how that would end for me. Idk", "Yeah you're right. Idk it's just hard to believe he'd do all of that on purpose", "I hadn't thought of that. We're both supposed to be at a party this week and now I'm thinking I should give it a miss. Idk how much control I'd have if he puts the moves on me again and obviously I don't want to repeat that mistake", "Ahhhh shit I missed that part my bad. Do you think he'll call your bluff? You could tell him, to protect both of you from any backlash about sexuality, that he needs to admit to her that he's cheated on her. Doesn't have to be specific. You could even tell her that much without including yourself.", "Nope. He's literally the only person", "Thanks - I'm glad you understand. And you're absolutely right, I think I'll try minimal contact for a while now", "Haha you can dm me", "So you\u2019re trying to decide if your 100% selfish excuse not to tell her is right? You\u2019ll have to decide that. But Letting people do wrong things because we are afraid to do what\u2019s right guarantees things to remain the same and you will never live in a world you want to and feel is yours. That\u2019s why we live in a time with so many issues, including being honest about sexuality, because people don\u2019t stand up and do what\u2019s right, they let others make their wrong choices and silently support them even when they disagree by doing nothing and going along with it.", "My guy, I have lost a friendship of almost 30 years due to a similar situation.  Your \"best friend\" does not give a shit about anyone but himself, and it will only become more apparent as time marches on.  Don't bother telling the gf, he will spin it into you coming onto him while he was incapacitated.  Guys like him don't admit fault, they manipulate situations so they are never wrong.\n\nMy life has only gotten better since I dropped my oldest friend, because I can focus on people who actually treat others decently.  Walk away before you have to deal with any more duplicity.", "Either way the first step is making it clear his actions cost *him* a 12 year long friendship, \nIn the end, all *you're*  losing someone who *takes advantage of you* \n\nIf then either of them care *why* your disconnecting from them, then you can weigh the odds better. \n\nIf they don't even care why your upset then they're aren't going to listen anyway tbh. \n\nI'm so sorry op your nta btw at all you were Tricked and taken advantage of by someone you trusted and that's horrible.", "I guess it could work but I'd be terrified that I'd end up outed. I also want to tread carefully because he's still my best friend and my feelings towards him are very mixed"]}
