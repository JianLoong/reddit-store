He shouldn't be bothering any of his brothers stuff, that is not his touch. It yours. \nAnother concern to bring here, is what else his is brother taking that you don't know about? It could be big sentimental value items so I suggest checking everything you can, making sure doors are locked, and if needed get camera. \nHonestly, get camera either way because just seeing how he is acting, he may come back to try and destroy.\n\nYou should kick them out the day of, they do not deserve the right to have 3 days with how they have been treating you. 3 days gives them the chance to destroy things, take things, and keep up with this behavior.

Of course your MIL would side with her son!  What he and what he's allowing his children to do is completely disrespectful to you and the memory of your late husband. \n\nGet them out.
