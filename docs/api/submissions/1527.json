They can stay with his mom.", "NTA I'm so sorry OP. Ask you MIL to take her son back.\nThey ruined your initial grieving period, minimising your feelings and took advantage of you when they should have been supporting you.\nI am so so sorry, you deserve better and your husband would have wanted that for you.", "NTA.\n\nSeems to me that you should have booted them out long before.  They clearly feel like they're entitled to your house.  They're not.  That house belongs to you and your husband, not theirs.  Just because he's his brother doesn't mean he has a right to do whatever he wants there.\n\nHis actions of being intrusive and using your late husband's things are not the acts of someone grieving.  They're the acts of an entitled leech.  And, from the looks of it, his children are emulating him and he's not doing anything to correct them, which is why I find it hilarious that he would fault you for not keeping your husband's gifts when he has been barging into your private space and helping himself to your husband's things (hypocrite, much).\n\nBoot them out and be done with them.

It sounds like your husband was a wonderful man who put a lot of thought into you and your feelings. \n\nYour BIL and kids clearly think this house and it\u2019s contents now belong to them as the house belonged to his brother.  Please check the Will, and if there is none get a lawyer to ensure that in your country without a will the husbands property passes to his wife. This will give you better grounds to kick BIL out.", "Absolutely NTA he's taking over your husband's place in the house acting like it's all his.  Get an attorney and get them out.", "NTA.

Your husband's family is taking advantage of you. Tell them to move out, now, before they've had a chance to establish residency in your house and you have to evict them.

It is YOUR house too, you may not of owned it but that was a place you and your husband created home.\nHis brother just came in and started trying to take control of the place, which isn't okay. He shouldn't be bothering any of his brothers stuff, that is not his touch. It yours. \nAnother concern to bring here, is what else his is brother taking that you don't know about? It could be big sentimental value items so I suggest checking everything you can, making sure doors are locked, and if needed get camera. \nHonestly, get camera either way because just seeing how he is acting, he may come back to try and destroy.\n\nYou should kick them out the day of, they do not deserve the right to have 3 days with how they have been treating you. 3 days gives them the chance to destroy things, take things, and keep up with this behavior.  Plus the more days their in your home, the more they are legally allowed to stay.", "No your not kick him out, he us trying to take over and he has let his children disrespect your home.

I know from personal experience how difficult it is to lose your spouse to cancer at a young age. \n\nDefinitely NTA. What your in laws are doing is attempting to stake a claim in the house.

Of course your MIL would side with her son!  What he and what he's allowing his children to do is completely disrespectful to you and the memory of your late husband. \n\nGet them out. Stand your ground. Did your husband leave a will? If so, who gets the house & his belongings?   Whether he did or not, find a good estate attorney.  It sounds as if your in-laws have a sense of entitlement regarding his possessions and will attempt to take control of everything they can manage to get their hands on.", "NTA.

Despicable.", "You have to prioritize your feelings over theirs. They are extremely disrespectful and ignore boundaries. When confronted they do not take responsibility or accountability instead blaming you for your reaction. They need you and treat you like it's the other way around. They can go live with your MIL because she lacks empathy and seems to believe toxic behavior is acceptable. You shouldn't have to hide items that are located in your bedroom. They should respect boundaries. It is common knowledge that we do not open gifts meant for another person. \n\nI'm sorry for your loss. Grieving is hard.

In the meantime,  change your locks and get a ring camera. I fear this isn't over.", "NTA. It's only going to get worse. Why does his \"grieving\" involve taking things without permission, allowing his kids to touch things that are not theirs, and guilt-tripping you every time you stand up for yourself? You matter too, OP. They need to go. Before they establish residency.", "NTA.  They have zero right to anything in the home, and shouldn't be anywhere they're not invited.  Entering your room, rummaging through your things, opening gifts meant for you, then trying to blame you?  They deserve worse than being asked to leave.  You were generous to take them in, and they are paying you back by violating what's yours and disrespecting you.  Giving them 3 days to leave rather than kicking them out on the spot is being gracious.", "NTA, get him the hell out of your home\nsoon they will be using their time there to claim tenancy and worst case dispute any will to try and get the house, kick them out and screw his family\nedit: from the looks of things if it was a reverse situation they would not give a shit about you", "Absolutely NTA. He's behaving dreadfully and trying to manipulate you. If his mother is so keen on him she can have him in her house.", "NTA. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this AH. Wearing/borrowing your husband's stuff is totally insensitive to your grief and them opening the gifts, which are an unreplaceable, priceless, wonderful parting gesture from your husband, is unforgiveable.

They need to leave now. You need people who help you grieve - not people demanding you help them process their grief. This is YOUR house. This is YOUR home. You don\u2019t have to do squat with your possessions, they are guests and should have the decency to act like them ESPECIALLY after the loss you have suffered. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to stand up for yourself.

I'm also sorry they ruined a beautiful, sweet thing your husband did for you. I hope you can salvage some of the gifts.

The fact that your BIL would dismiss that so readily is gross. Also it's his job to supervise his kids, not yours.\n\nFrankly it's creepy that he's using your late husband's memory to emotionally blackmail you with his \"what would Adam want\" bullshit. Tell that mfer that if he gave a shit what Adam wanted he wouldn't be so dismissive of the gifts he left behind for you. That was a direct final wish of his brother. I'm sure you know that he doesn't give two shits about what Adam wanted and is only trying to manipulate you.\n\n3 days is vastly more generous that I would be. I'd be telling him to pack his shit and get out there and then.

I wouldn\u2019t have given him 3 days! \n\nMy advice is to lock him out (as in change the locks, btw, like TODAY!) and I would have a police officer present when he comes to get his things. \n\nEmpty a room of anything of yours. Furniture and all.  Then take your husband\u2019s belongings - all of them - to a storage unit or the home of someone you trust so nothing else is stolen or destroyed. Put all of your BIL/his kids stuff in the empty room and make sure that the cop knows that BIL\u2019s family\u2019s things are all in that one room and only BIL is to be allowed in to take them outside. \n\nHis kids can be outside to load shit in the car, but not in your home because they\u2019ve destroyed enough. Explain that reason to everyone involved, but especially the cop. The cop is your backup here. Don\u2019t leave any room for him to do anything else.\n\nThis man is clearly toxic. Cut. Him. Off. He is using grief as an excuse to run all over you. So become the nail that deflates his tires. If your late husband\u2019s family wants to disrespect you, then there\u2019s no reason for you to maintain contact with them. Do you really want to keep in touch with people who do things like this? \n\nAnd just how old are his kids? Old enough to know better, I\u2019m guessing, or you probably wouldn\u2019t be as upset\u2026.
