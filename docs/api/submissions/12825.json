Most biracial women of any races are typically more attractive because they get the best traits from a wider pool of phenotypes.", "If you take people's saying you look like a white woman as an insult, then isn't that a sign you're racist? If I use black person as a term of derision then that would be racist af. Seems to me bf is enabling a racist", "So you're/she is making judgements of strangers based on skin colour?....sounds kinda racist. Are you saying we should seek to empathise with racists?", "Your nervous system / emotions don't mind about indisputable facts, it's psychology not physics", "Okay, so having read that article it seems she's been gaslighted by a man who may not even be her father, because \"he said so\".\n\nAnd still to this day tries to claim that she is black when she evidently is not?", "Right. Women of color get opposite color hair all the time. I\u2019m Hispanic, but I\u2019ve been blonde. Doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m trying to be white. I just really liked blonde hair. If she wants to get a new wig (which isn\u2019t permanent) she can get it. that\u2019s not an invitation for OP to say she\u2019s white passing.", "If you knew she was half black? Maybe if you were dating?", "She\u2019s offended when she was called white while she\u2019s biracial. She clearly has resentment towards that group and thinks less of them as compared to the other half of her race.", "Yeah that\u2019s how I keep looking at it. Like someone telling me my teeth look yellow, I have self conscious issues and I hate when people make comments about my body but I\u2019d rather someone tell me then go around looking like that.", "Absolutely this. NTA. Not race related at all but if I asked my husband how something looked on me, he'd give me his honest opinion. And if he knew that it accentuated a part of me I don't like, he'd tell me. \"I think it looks amazing on you. You might get comments about XYZ though.\" Meaning he gave me the opinion I asked for but was also looking out for me based on what he knows about me.", "Blonde hair isn't exclusive to or completely owned by white women and that also doesn't mean she wants to look like one.", "Let's be clear for a second blonde hair is not exclusive to white women ex: there is a tribe Solomon Islanders who have natural blonde hair. I'm tired of this perception that hair is exclusive to a skin color when it's not ..\n\nAlso The Melanesian people have a native TYRP1 gene which is partly responsible for the blond hair and melanin, and is totally distinct to that of Caucasians as it doesn't exist in their genes.... \n\n please educate yourself. It's 2023.", "Exaclty!  If she wanted to not appear white, the last thing she should have done was purchase a wig in a color that is normally associated with white people.", "[removed]", "But why? Reddit is full of ignorant white people. That being the top response makes total sense.", "Yes, I'm surprised by the flood of comments mocking her and calling her names. \"If she has issues with her white side, she needs therapy,\" when it's clearly stated that her white relatives are racist. Makes me sad.", "But on the flip side, wouldn\u2019t she want to know that she looks white passing if she very clearly doesn\u2019t otherwise want to look that way? She may have experiences out in the world where people assume she\u2019s white and better to know ahead of time than out in a different public scenario.\n\nI would think a straight blonde wig (literally the hair type that only white people can have naturally) was probably a bad idea to begin with.", "But she's biracial...he was literally just making a comment that reflected what he saw in reality. \n NTA", "You cannot remove the hair color from the equation, it's literally a major part of this whole problem. \n\nBlonde hair is generally associated with white people (this isn't saying exclusive to white people, just associated with them more often than not), and for someone who's light skinned, it'll obviously make them look super white.\n\nHis joke aside, she should have known what a blonde wig would have made her look like. So, why are you willing to wave off her responsibility to herself? Why are you also trying to ignore the blatant identity issues this poor woman has? \n\nThere are far bigger, and more important things to look at and address than a stupid joke.", "He shouldn't have said it as a joke but would she want to know that the wig was accentuating her 'whiteness'?", "Key word, usually. It can be blonde and straight.", "It's not an apology if you make an excuse ,take no responsibility, and put all the blame on her", "Yes, someone who experienced racism from even her own family is \"overly sensitive.\" \ud83d\ude44", "yeah that's a huge difference", "YIKES. Women's worth is not just their looks, and your statement about biracial women is wild and comes off as fetishistic. OP's GF probably doesn't want to be fetishized for being biracial. She sees herself as Black and she gets to self-determine that way.", "No if you read each word, I\u2019m saying there are varying degrees of experiencing racism. If she\u2019s experienced really traumatic racism from her own damn \u201cloved ones\u201d it could be having extremely damaging impacts on her outlook. Imagine if her grandmother called her the n word and/or very obviously was cruel to her as a young child in a way she wasn\u2019t with her other white grandchildren. Again, empathy is not assuming you know someone and their experiences. And it sounds like her bf knows her experiences pretty damn well.\n\nAnd yes, as a black woman I have empathized with many white racists on SOME level before because many of them have that foul vitriol ingrained in them as toddlers, which in and of itself is abusive. Not very fair but also not excusable, which is why I emphasize some level of empathy. It\u2019s not difficult to deploy with critical thought.\n\nAlso many biracial people choose to identify as simply black or white. It is their right and who are you to question it lmao. How does it impact your ability to live?", "Bruh he was her dad. Regardless of biology, she regards him as her dad. That\u2019s not gaslighting. That article also wasn\u2019t a very good one I just grabbed the top google result. She says more in other articles.", "With your use if the word gaslighting, im guessing you weren't around when he was alive?", "Would it be better for her SO to let her know, someone she knows and trusts in a safe space, or some random stranger who won't take her feelings or history into account?", "No, not under any circumstances would I say to someone \u201cu look like a black woman today\u201d or \u201cu look like a white woman today\u201d there\u2019s no certain way to look for any race. that\u2019s just a very peculiar thing to say in any context.", "I am biracial. I dont necessarily have to be offended to acknowledge the reality that, depsite me having a white parent, I am not and will never be considered white by other white people. \n\nI think the gf had to confront uncomfortable emotions that can come with being biracial, forever teetering on the borderline of two races, benefiting from white privilege more the closer you look to white. Maybe she was hit with the realization that she's closer to whiteness than she thought, due to her fair skin. I could put on a blonde wig but I would still looked like a WOC in a blonde wig, not like a white lady lol. Sure I could straighten and dye my curly hair and wear contacts, but my skin is still brown and my facial features are visibly Black.", "I would also get offended if called white, that doesn't make me an \"anti-white\" type of person.", "First, do you both know the rule that you\u2019re only supposed to tell someone something\u2019s ugly/bad if they can change it in 5 min? Aka, tell someone they have spinach in their teeth, but don\u2019t tell someone their teeth are yellow. This is likely not a \u201cchange it in 5 min\u201d deal. \n\nSecond, a **joke,** which this was, is NOT helpful. If he had been trying to help, it would not have been \u201cHa you look white.\u201d That\u2019s not helpful. Ever. Helpful would be a real conversation, based on mutual respect. This is farrr from that.", "It\u2019s not exclusive no, but to act like when you have certain skin tones and features adding straight blonde hair will remove people perceiving you as mixed race.", "You\u2019re absolutely right and I thought about this\u2026 my deal is, the gf didn\u2019t WANT to look white\u2026 if she has or takes issue with this part of her why grab a blond wig? Even with this information (and yes we look AMAZING in blond hair), but to do it knowing how she feels is like she\u2019s setting herself up for failure\u2026", "Genes or not, no race/ethnicity should have the authority to police a hairstyle. You want to wear your hair a certain way? Go ahead.", "Except none of the groups mentioned identify as black. Educate yourself! It's a poor example and does not stick to topic at hand.", "sounds like the girlfriend is a bit racist", "Stereotypical and exclusive are not the same word. Maybe you need to educate yourself.", "Is their hair also straight? \ud83d\ude44", "Vanishingly few have natural blond straight hair. If she identifies as black, maybe this should be considered cultural appropriation.", "I suppose I should of said, disappointed but not surprised cause you're right", "She probably does need therapy though. It's not healthy to hate a part of yourself that much.", "If you're at odds with your own racial identity and background , you absolutely should get therapy", "He could have told her in a non-joking manner.", "If you tell me you\u2019re sensitive about your weight and I tell you you\u2019re fat, even if you are, I\u2019d still be an asshole right? Okay.", "99.999999% of black people will not have straight blonde hair. So why anyone would put on a blonde wig and get offended when someone says they look white is beyond me. Especially coupled when they are already fair skinned. He told the truth. NTA", "I don't think he put the blame on her, he came here for confirmation", "Why is it about me? We are talking about the possibly pretend people in the story. In that instance it was a massive overreaction to react that badly to being called white...when you are part white. You do not get to choose your race. I mean..you can claim you're whatever race you want but tansracialism is a joke made up to mock the far left. It isn't to be actually respected.", ">Bruh he was her dad. Regardless of biology, she regards him as her dad.\n\nI generally agree with this sentiment. However, when discussing heritage which is exclusively biological, its important to make the distinction.", "People always use gaslighting without knowing what it actually is lol", "What a very strange assumption to make, what's lead you to that conclusion?\n\nYou'd be wrong, I was very much alive and adulting when MJ died.", "Let her know what? Get a grip, she\u2019s wearing a wig it has 0 effect on anybody", "Assuming you have white heritage like OP\u2019s girlfriend and have family members who are white, could you elaborate on why someone calling you white might offend you? genuinely curious", "Choosing a different wig is in fact a 5 min deal.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I think I hurt someone's feelings because you're not even talking about the topic at hand you're literally scolding my verbiage ...", "So if I straightened my hair, you're saying that I look like a brunette, white woman?", "It\u2019s actually uncommon for white women to have *naturally* blonde hair.

She just doesn't identify with the wing of her family tree that is populated with racists.", "If I told you, \"you look fat in that wig,\" I think some people would probably appreciate the honesty and being given a heads up. Personally, when my partner tells me that I look a certain kind of way when I wear an accessory or outfit, I appreciate the input and modify my appearance accordingly if it bothers me. \n\nAnd he said in the comments that he did immediately apologize- which again follows that idea that he was just trying to tell her something that actually reflected reality, not to take a dig at her. And when that wasn't well-received, he didn't double down or anything.", "You don\u2019t get to choose your race, but people frequently identify as one race or the other. This conversation has been going since I was literally in high school 15 years ago, biracial people can terribly struggle with feeling belonging and finding their \u201cplace\u201d in society.

I am not sure what it is like in the usa but not every country gets all its blonde from a box.", "Empathy is fine as long as lack thereof doesn't elicit anger. \"Be empathetic or else\" is a weird mantra to live by", "I said choosing a different wig or even not to wear said wig.
