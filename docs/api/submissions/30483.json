Edit - I mean don't force it, if you still want the trip do that.  But don't try to force the feeling \n\nI think you're being incredibly generous just spending time with him as much as you are. I think it takes time and you may never see him as your dad, but maybe one day you will. But if you force it now, it won't ever happen.  \n\nHe left, he's making an effort now - but it doesn't undue a lifetime. \n\nGood for you, and I hope you keep as level a head moving forward.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. You were being honest. I don't know what your biological dad expects, but if it is to roll on the scene as your full father in one foul swoop, I would imagine he has another think coming. It is going to take literally years for you to get to know him properly, and I don't know if either of you are willing and able to put the time and the work in? One could also argue that you don't really need him, because you have one perfectly good father already, namely the one who raised you. I don't think it should in any way be your problem to make up for your biological father's lost time.", "Mike needs to understand that he's just the biological donor. He, for whatever reason, decided to cut and run. Why he's back in your (and your family's) orbit shouldn't be an issue between you and your dad.\n\nNTA", "NTA - If you want to continue a relationship, let him know you love him. You can also better explain how your dad will always be your dad because he was there with you from 1 until Mike came back into your life. Maybe you can have two dads in the future, but for now you have one.\n\nI wish you the best.", "NTA. You\u2019re not (very rarely) going to meet someone when you\u2019re almost an adult and form a parental bond with them. That doesn\u2019t mean that you guys can\u2019t form a bond and be friends. He needs to adjust his expectations.", "NTA in this situation\n\nits great you have a dad that raised you even though he wasnt biological", "NTA - I always wonder about these @$$hole sperm donors and how they deal with the fallout of bailing on their kid(s). \n\nYou owe him nothing - he is starting from such a deep hole I\u2019d be shocked if you gave him the time of day.", "NTA - he turned up after the hard stuff is over.  \nHe may be your father but he isn\u2019t your dad.", "NTA. Really, short of him being imprisoned in a foreign country there is no valid excuse for abandoning your kid for that long. He lost the chance to be seen as a father figure. Now maybe he really has changed as a person and if you're willing to let him into your life that's fine. Pretty much he was a stranger that came to you when you were practically an adult and should only be working towards being your friend at this point in time.", "NTA - I always wonder about these @$$hole sperm donors and how they deal with the fallout of bailing on their kid(s). \n\nYou owe him nothing - he is starting from such a deep hole I\u2019d be shocked if you gave him the time of day.", "NTA\n\nIt is your decision who you feel comfortable with calling your Dad. It is also up to you if you want to leave that door open so that one day bio Dad could earn a relationship with you.", "Biologically he may be your father but the man who raised you, who taught you right from wrong and was there when you needed him is your dad. It\u2019s understandable that he might regret his choices in abandoning you but this isn\u2019t something that can be forgotten or just changed with an apology, the relationship you have with your dad was forged over years of being together you just don\u2019t have that with biological-dad.", "NTA. It's always best to be honest and up front about the situation. Reality is that you're 18 now. You're an adult. It is way too late for him to swoop in and be \"Dad\", especially since someone already stepped up to do the job. At best he can be like an uncle or older friend. That he missed the prime Dad years is on him. It's not your fault or your responsibility and you're being incredibly generous to allow him into your life now.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The consequences of his poor decision are his only.", "NTA.\nMike is your biological father. He abandoned your mother before you were born and now he's upset that you don't see him as your 'dad'. \nWhy would you? Two years ago he was a stranger. And, you still probably don't really know him all that well. It's his responsibility to work to build a real relationship with you. And that's probably going to take some time. Both of you need to get to know one another and build a relationship.", "NTA\n\nBiological relation doesn\u2019t not make a person a father, mother, sister, brother, or any other family member. Blood does not define family. \n\nThe person who raised, supported, protected, guided, cared, and loved you is your parent or family\n\nIt\u2019s good that bio father is trying to form a bond but it\u2019s unrealistic for him to think that he can show up and expect to be seen as a father figure. It\u2019s also completely normal and okay to have doubts about him. \n\nHave a talk with your mom and dad to express your feelings so they are on the same page as you and you have the support/back up you need. \n\nMaybe explain via text, letter, phone call, or in person (with or without your parents) to bio father that it\u2019s going to take a lot of work and time to gain trust and to build positive image of him. You already have a dad so maybe you guys can work on being friends first and if it works out then maybe there is a chance we can be family (like a uncle/niece or something like that). If your bio father can\u2019t accept or work with this then you at least said you tried. \n\nI suggest not doing this trip until your bio father has clear understand on the dynamics of y\u2019all\u2019s relationship. Eliminate any expectations or ideas that he has built up in his head after you express your feelings. Also, don\u2019t force yourself to do anything for anyone or anything unless you mean it 100%. \n\nI suggest doing small things and slowly progress to bigger things like you would do when getting to know a stranger and building a relationship.", ">i said that my opinion on him wasn\u2019t going to change and if he wasn\u2019t okay with it he could walk out like he did before\n\n**WORD**.\n\nNTA, and he's lucky that you've allowed him space to explore entering your life, considering his abandoning you early on.\n\n And \\*showing up at your work to make you see him\\*?? I mean WTF is that bs?!\n\nYou don't owe him a single apology. \n\nAlso, maybe dip out of that trip if you feel it's contingent on you going along with his Performative Dad requirement.\n\nGotta say...there are huge gaps / Missing Reasons on his part in your post. But I can also see the confusion and implied pain on your end. \n\nDon't set yourself on fire to keep his ego warm.\n\nAs you told him to his face...he could walk out again as he did before if he refuses to accept that your opinion isn't gonna change about him.", "I was with you until I got to this point.\n\n>i said that my opinion on him wasn\u2019t going to change and if he wasn\u2019t okay with it he could walk out like he did before\n\nI don't fault you for not seeing him as your dad. He didn't raise you and it's completely unrealistic that he could miss your entire upbringing, come back into your life when you're an adult, then have the nerve to be disappointed that you didn't see him as your real dad.\n\nOn the other hand, that response of yours was unnecessarily cruel. I know he can't make up for having missed your entire childhood, but it sounds like he regrets and is doing his best to form a decent relationship with you.\n\nESH.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to make yourself see him as your dad because he is not your dad. He is your biological father your sperm donor.

He needs to come to terms with himself about not having raised you, because that\u2019s the path he chose, not you. It\u2019s ok to not ever see him as your dad. He\u2019s still in your life and loved. \n\nYou chose to have a relationship with him, and want it to continue. That\u2019s huge & the most important thing. It\u2019s good he found out your feelings. Telling him he can walk away again may have been painful but communicated well the hurt that he created in doing so. That\u2019s how healing starts. \n\nWishing you a happy future with both Mike and your dad.", ">i want him to be in my life i really do,\n\nWhy? And what has your Mom told you about him/this situation/her thoughts?", "It sounds like you need to take the time to get your thoughts and feelings together and have an honest conversation with him. Write him a letter if that\u2019s easier. \nOne thing I might add - you don\u2019t see him as a dad right now and you said you don\u2019t think you\u2019d ever see him as your dad. Are you open to the possibility of one day seeing him as a father figure? \nYou don\u2019t owe him anything but it might be better for yourself to clear the air. Let him know that you don\u2019t see him as a dad, that you don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll ever view him as a dad to you. Make if clear if he wants to have a relationship with you that it will take time, that maybe it won\u2019t be what his picturing in his head but you do want him in your life and to see where you fit in each others lives."]}
