That she is not to schedule work on that day.\n\nI do more of the household work since my hours are consistent, and I work 9 to 5. With two to three of my work days being remote each week. There is some after-hours work, but I am very protective of my personal time, so I push back on it often. \n\nShe got upset with me that I'm not \"helping with our youngest\". She is two and the only time she sees her mom some weeks outside of briefly before I put her to bed is on that weekend day. I pretty much told her that she was doing this to herself with how much she was working. That nothing short of me taking our daughter to another part of the house or leaving is going to accomplish what she wants. And unless she is sick and needs rest, I'm not going to do it. I told her that her option for having some personal time to decompress is during the week when the kids are at school. She could have 9 to 10 hours completely free since I take the kids to school and pick them up at the end of the day 99% of the time. I also told her that she could actually help out some around the house during that time as well.\n\nI was definitely blunt, but it wasn't rude of disrespectful. So, AITA for telling my wife that if she wants time to decompress and general time for herself then she shouldn't volunteer to work so much?

You can't pour from an empty cup, so sometimes the kids CAN'T come first because you NEED to take care of yourself in order to care for them. That's just a FACT that far too many people forget. However, your wife is VOLUNTARILY surrendering the feasible down time she can get without putting too much on you.... and honestly it sounds like she's already putting too much on you. \n\nHer calling you an AH sounds more like projecting her guilt because she knows you're right but won't admit it...", "NTA.  She's made her choice.", "Nta. She's literally choosing her job over her family. This is unsustainable in the long run, and I don't think it's going to end well. It's admirable she's so dedicated to her team, especially being in the medical feild, but, she has a terrible work/life balance. That's not healthy.", "NTA. I totally get her wanting to have time to herself. But it doesn't seem like you're getting that, either. And she's voluntarily working overtime.

It's wrong that she's deciding for you that you don't get any time off, and then expecting that any hour that she's not working she gets time to herself. She needs to spend some time with the kids and also support you as your partner", "NAH. I\u2019m also a nurse, and it\u2019s rough right now.

Our jobs also involve the supporting and sustaining of human life.. which since you work remote, I\u2019m going to assume is different than your work OP. The job is hard.. and sometimes we make sacrifices in our personal life for our patients. BUT, she also has obligations at home. She\u2019s pulled in two directions and trying to do what is right for the people she cares for and those she works with. \n\nI was once told that in life we juggle balls, some rubber and some glass. If you drop a rubber ball from time to time, it bounces back but with glass, it shatters. This helped me understand my family is glass. Yes sometimes I still pick up extra and help out the unit, but I no longer sacrifice myself or my family to do so. \n\nHope that helps.", "NTA , but damn that\u2019s sucks op the one day off where she can spend with her kids and she\u2019s asking you take on more so she has some time to herself, she\u2019s doing this to herself and your family. work life balance is huge for your health mental/physical/family sucky part is she will be the only one to blame when she loses all the time with her kids, really nothing you can do about that what your doing now is your best approach stick to it hold your ground she can be upset and probably will at you it\u2019ll cause a issues in the household and only you know how much of it you can deal with. Hopefully she\u2019ll catch on sooner or later.

She's going out of her way to avoid being around your children.", "Yup NTA and I am tired of parents who need their time to de stress at the cost of their children. Fuck everyone of you you your children deserve better and if you are a good parent spending time with your children should be your de stresser if not your doing it wrong. Wait for it in the future when she gets angry and blames you for her shitty relationship with her kids.

My wife makes a little more than I do with all the overtime hours, and I make slightly more than double the median household income for the metro area we live in.

My RN SO takes on more of the chores because he winds up with big stretches of days off working that same 3x12 schedule and he even works nights. This whole situation deserves more digging into WHY on your part.\n\nShe is working 6 days a week currently. Usually she would work 4 to 5 and we really didn't have any problems. Now she only has 1 day off each week. I set a boundary early on in this that she needed to maintain one weekend day for us to spend time as a family as well as being able to do datenights. You can call it an ultimatum, but I view it as a boundary and it was communicated that way. That I wanted her to maintain that day off no matter what is going on at work for the reasons I provide above.", "I mean it's not going above and beyond, it's her seeking praise and sacrificing boundaries because she cares more about getting accolades from her employers, who will burn through her like she's nothing, then doing right by you as a partner and doing right by your kids by participating as a parent.\n\nGiven that you know this is historically an issue, perhaps you should demand couples therapy sessions, and bring this up during the sessions. Because it is a problem that she's prioritizing doing right by her employer over being there for you and your kids.", "That\u2019s more than fair and appropriate. That\u2019s why I like the glass vs rubber ball analogy. Work is 100% rubber here.", "I agree. When I was younger, I used to come in extra a lot if we were short staffed (OB RN). I began to realize that I was wearing myself out, and still had family obligations to take care of. Later on, I\u2019d come in if it worked out for my family, but administration is ultimately responsible for finding extra staff. No one is irreplaceable.", "Did you read my comment?", "It comes from experience. I took a salaried educator position and the work never ended.. I was putting in 60-80 hours a week at the hospital and working hours more each night and on weekends at home. Another salaried nurse (different department) shared the juggling glass vs rubber balls with me and it stuck and helped me prioritize better.", "The only demand I see in this is you saying \"not your weekend day\"... which is a COMPLETELY  reasonable demand to make... marriage and parenthood is a partnership, as such decisions should be made as a TEAM. \n\nShe isn't being a team player by picking up shifts without talking about it first, then demanding that you do what she can't at home ON TOP of everything that you already do? It's quickly shaking out to 80/20 instead of 50/50. And while everyone has times they need to give less, and need their partners to give more, those times shouldn't be constant.", "It might also be that she finds work easier than being at home. If she's good at her job, I can see why she'd prefer to be there where she feels in control and knows how everything works, while at home things can be more complicated (raising a child can be full of surprises, the lack of explicit hierarchy can make for complicated dynamics if you're not openly communicative, the lack of explicit functions she needs to take on might make her feel like she's unsure what she should and shouldn't have to do for the household, etc.)."]}
