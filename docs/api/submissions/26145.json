She was my last living parent.  \nI have four siblings and the \u201chonor\u201d of being co-executors and distributing the assets of the estate has fallen on to me and my sister. My mother\u2019s last will and testament carefully detailed what was to happen with her assets and when. My sister and I, as co-executors, had very little room for discretion in settling the estate  \nWhile cleaning out my mother\u2019s house, my brother (M54) told me, unsolicited, that he and his husband are discussing divorce. He asked me to hold on to his share of the estate until he figures out his marital situation\u2014 in other words, help him \u201chide\u201d the money.   \nMy brother told me I could not tell anyone about his marital situation, even my spouse. I made a noise that could be interpreted as agreement, although I\u2019m not really sure. I was surprised by the information and the demand that I not tell anyone, including my spouse.  \nFirst, my brother did not give me an opportunity to consent to receiving his \u201csecret.\u201d He didn't ask me, \u201cIf I tell you something, can you promise not to tell anyone, including your spouse?\u201d He just told me the information and then demanded I not tell anyone else. Even if he gave me a chance to consent to holding his secret, I\u2019m not sure I would agree to withhold it from my spouse. We have a close relationship (married 30+ years) and I run almost everything by them. They are my sounding board, I trust nobody more. I told my spouse.  \nSecond, as a co-executor of the estate, I can\u2019t make decisions in a vacuum. I have to consult my sister, the other co-executor, and our estate attorney. So, I told them that my brother asked if we could hold on to his share of the estate for a few months beyond what the last will and testament requires. I gave no information about my brother\u2019s marital situation. When my sister asked me why my brother wanted us to hold the money for longer, I told her she had to talk to him. The lawyer told me, \u201cNo,\u201d we cannot hold the money for my brother for an extended period of time.  \nI called my brother to share the attorney\u2019s advice.   \nMy brother was livid with me.  \nMy sister, the co-executor, had called my brother to find out why he wanted us to hold the money. My brother accused me of violating his trust. I tried to explain to him that I had a legal obligation to consult with my other co-executor (my sister) and the attorney regarding all matters related to the estate.   \nMy brother started crying and said, \u201cI bet you told your spouse.\u201d   \nMaybe I should have lied. I admitted I told my spouse.  I explained that he didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to consent to receiving his \u201csecret.\u201d If he had, I probably would not have agreed to keep it from my spouse.   \nMy brother told me I ruined our relationship, that I am an untrustworthy person.   \nHe withdrew from my life and only communicated with me regarding matters related to the estate.  \nThe estate is long since settled and my brother still won\u2019t talk to me.   \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693750654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168y743/aita_for_fulfilling_my_obligation_as_coexecutor/", "score": 198, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How much you trust them isn't relevant. I don't tell married people things because so many of them run right to their spouses and repeat it all. \n\nLegal wise, NTA because you can get into financial trouble for breaking fiduciary rules and inheritance isn't shared marital property in most places.", "It could come into play if there are support obligations at issue separate from the property division.", "Isn\u2019t this state by state?

In the scenario that would have played out if you had been immediately responsive in the moment, then he would have been unable to be angry at you for that reason.
