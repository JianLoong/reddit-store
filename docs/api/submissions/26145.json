My mother\u2019s last will and testament carefully detailed what was to happen with her assets and when. My sister and I, as co-executors, had very little room for discretion in settling the estate  \nWhile cleaning out my mother\u2019s house, my brother (M54) told me, unsolicited, that he and his husband are discussing divorce. He asked me to hold on to his share of the estate until he figures out his marital situation\u2014 in other words, help him \u201chide\u201d the money.   \nMy brother told me I could not tell anyone about his marital situation, even my spouse. I made a noise that could be interpreted as agreement, although I\u2019m not really sure. I was surprised by the information and the demand that I not tell anyone, including my spouse.  \nFirst, my brother did not give me an opportunity to consent to receiving his \u201csecret.\u201d He didn't ask me, \u201cIf I tell you something, can you promise not to tell anyone, including your spouse?\u201d He just told me the information and then demanded I not tell anyone else. Even if he gave me a chance to consent to holding his secret, I\u2019m not sure I would agree to withhold it from my spouse. We have a close relationship (married 30+ years) and I run almost everything by them. They are my sounding board, I trust nobody more. I told my spouse.  \nSecond, as a co-executor of the estate, I can\u2019t make decisions in a vacuum. I have to consult my sister, the other co-executor, and our estate attorney. So, I told them that my brother asked if we could hold on to his share of the estate for a few months beyond what the last will and testament requires. I gave no information about my brother\u2019s marital situation. When my sister asked me why my brother wanted us to hold the money for longer, I told her she had to talk to him. The lawyer told me, \u201cNo,\u201d we cannot hold the money for my brother for an extended period of time.  \nI called my brother to share the attorney\u2019s advice.   \nMy brother was livid with me.  \nMy sister, the co-executor, had called my brother to find out why he wanted us to hold the money. My brother accused me of violating his trust. I tried to explain to him that I had a legal obligation to consult with my other co-executor (my sister) and the attorney regarding all matters related to the estate.   \nMy brother started crying and said, \u201cI bet you told your spouse.\u201d   \nMaybe I should have lied. I admitted I told my spouse.  I explained that he didn\u2019t give me an opportunity to consent to receiving his \u201csecret.\u201d If he had, I probably would not have agreed to keep it from my spouse.   \nMy brother told me I ruined our relationship, that I am an untrustworthy person.   \nHe withdrew from my life and only communicated with me regarding matters related to the estate.  \nThe estate is long since settled and my brother still won\u2019t talk to me.   \nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1693750654, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168y743/aita_for_fulfilling_my_obligation_as_coexecutor/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you telling your spouse didn't impact him in any way with regards to his divorce. It sounds like he was going through a bit of a tough time and wasn't happy that the estate couldn't hold the money - I'm guessing this led to him having to declare it during the financial part of the divorce", "\nYour brother didn\u2019t give you a choice by blurting his request out like that. Why is he so upset that his shifty ways have been exposed to your spouse. \n\nLet him nurse his hurts as long as he needs to. If anyone is untrustworthy in this situation it\u2019s him. \n\nPlus it\u2019s unrealistic to believe that just because his share of the estate was disbursed after the divorce his ex wouldn\u2019t have gone after it since the death of you mother happened during the marriage (if at all the ex had any claim to his inheritance which is often not considered marital property). \n\nNTA\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You were just the messenger for the estate.\n\nIf he didn't want you to tell people, he shouldn't have told you. A simple \"can you hold off distributing the estate for a while?\" would have worked. Your brother decided to share too much information and admit that he was trying to hide funds from his divorce. Anything that happens is his own fault for not keeping his mouth shut until he was ready to go public. \n\nHe didn't tell you because he wanted emotional support, he told you because he wanted you to help him game the system.

Being open with your husband is wonderful, but there's a difference between having no secrets from each other within your own relationship and sharing information with your husband that has nothing to do with you, him, or your relationship with him.\n\nHowever, if you are unable to refrain from telling your husband everything about everyone and everything all the time, you should have told your brother that you were going to share this information with your husband before you did. \n\nMaybe your brother is a greedy jerk who hoped to screw over his spouse. Maybe your brother was an emotional wreck, having lost his parent and on the verge of losing his marriage. Either way, you were the AH to tell your husband anything about your brother's marital problems, but if in retrospect you are sympathetic to your brother's request to keep that to yourself,  you should apologize and let him know you understand how you failed him.", "YTA You made your brother believe you\u2019d keep a nefarious secret by not saying \u201cNO\u201d.

Yeah okay. \n\nYou are NTA and your brother is a big one!", "INFO: Where do you live? Inheritances in the US are generally not marital property. Could this have been mitigated with a call to the estate attorney?", "YTA. There is no need to share other people's secrets with your spouse. I don't care how long you have been married. How much you trust them isn't relevant. I don't tell married people things because so many of them run right to their spouses and repeat it all. \n\nLegal wise, NTA because you can get into financial trouble for breaking fiduciary rules and inheritance isn't shared marital property in most places.", "It could come into play if there are support obligations at issue separate from the property division.", "Isn\u2019t this state by state?  (In the absence of a prenup of course)", "I suppose I was caught by surprise and afraid to say how I really felt, for many different reasons, including getting yelled at in the moment.  \nHindsight being what it is, I wish I had been brave enough to say something right then and there.  \nAs my therapist helped me realize, I don't think the outcome would have been any different: Angry brother.", "This is a perfect response", "It's doubly stupid because inheritances aren't marital assets and as long as they weren't mingled, wouldn't have been a factor in any divorce.", "I couldn\u2019t disagree more.

You may be close but you're not one person. They're your partner, they're not my partner. They don't need to know my shit.", "The outcome may have been the same, but the reasons for the anger would have been different.  In the scenario that played out in real life, his anger is because of a perceived confidence that you failed to hold.  In the scenario that would have played out if you had been immediately responsive in the moment, then he would have been unable to be angry at you for that reason.  In fact, if you had been forthright with your thoughts, then his anger would have been misplaced, and perhaps he would have come to realize it later.\n\nI think if you have explained that you were caught off-guard in the moment and failed to react appropriately to the position he put you in \"UNFAIRLY,\" and then realized after the fact that you were wrong to break the confidence before telling him that you could not keep it, you might be able to adequately describe that you both were wrong.  He should not get off Scot-free thinking he is a victim, but at the same time, taking some ownership for your mistake might help.", "Probably less angry brother though\u2026The way you did it is like a betrayal vs upfront giving him time to prepare or withdraw the request such that you needn\u2019t have said anything to your sister at least.", "Well, not saying anything on the spot, yes. But once you came to your senses and realize you could not hold onto the information for legal and emotional reasons, you should have disclosed that to him ASAP.", "Whatever.

What happened now if just deserved.", "youre better off without him, he can break the law by himself", "The OP didn't ask if the brother was TA regarding his spouse. The issue is between the OP and the brother. There's no indication that the brother cut off the OP because distribution of his share of the inheritance couldn't be delayed. The issue is the OP telling her husband that her brother was discussing divorce. \n\nThe brother didn't try to commit a crime. He tried to potentially hide a marital asset. The brother was stupid because even an undistributed inheritance is an asset, and even if his husband didn't know about the mother's death (unlikely) the inheritance would have been discovered in the n the event of a divorce.", "Okay fair enough, I messed up calling it a crime. It\u2019s still immoral. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I always assume if I tell somebody something I\u2019m also telling their spouse. I\u2019d be pretty irritated if my family was asking me to do something like that and hide it from my wife."]}
