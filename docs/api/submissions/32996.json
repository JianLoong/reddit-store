I was attacked by dogs intentionally by my \u201cfriend\u201d. He \u201cwanted to see what would happen\u201d if his aggressive dogs were in the backyard and I came in. Anyway, the lawsuit took awhile as most do and I signed the papers on my 18th birthday. I won $58k and put it in my savings account with my mom on the account as well. I was allowed $15k to put down on a car, $1k for free spending and the rest was for college. Two years later, while I was in college, my parents divorced and I went into a depression since it was very unexpected. I dropped out of college because I couldn\u2019t get myself to go anymore. My mom took the remaining money (about $40k) out of my account since I \u201cwasn\u2019t in school anymore\u201d. After that, I had moved out and was always struggling financially. Orange County, California is a very expensive place to live. I was working at a bank and got promoted to a position that was 45 mins away and there was times I was stuck on the side of the road with no gas and no money to pay for any. My mom would say \u201cI can send you maybe $5\u201d. Mind you, that would get me just to work and not back. I would get really mad because she had taken all my money and was leaving me stranded on my drives to and from work. I eventually had to move to my dad\u2019s house 5 hours north from home because I couldn\u2019t afford rent anymore. The city he lives in is very unsafe and I didn\u2019t feel comfortable living in it but I had no other choice. I\u2019m still in financial trouble 10 years later and she won\u2019t give me my money back. I don\u2019t know what to do. Her name is on the account but I was the one who went through the traumatic experience and was awarded the money.\n\nSide note: she lives in a $9m beach house and is on extravagant vacations at least 2 times a month. She gives me $100 a month but I really need all my money back.\n\nWhat should I do about this?

Check with a lawyer but there's a very good chance you don't have a case to get your money back.", "It would be cheaper if you reported her to the police.", "NTA. Tell you mother to give you all of your money immediately or you will have to seek legal counsel. That money was yours and she stole it from you. She has no claim to it. If you\u2019re on a joint bank account and one party removes a significant amount of money from the account without permission of the other account holders then a judge may issue a penalty and make the other party return the money.", "How close are you to your mums parents? I would go round and see them. Diplomatically ask them if they know the reason why your mum has decided not to release the funds to you. They may not even be aware and if you have sound reasoning and  alaid out plan of how this money will be utilised. Eg pay off debt, utilise it to have an emergency fund, have a deposit for a rental apt etc then persuade them to assist you in getting her to release the funds.  \n\nIf that doesn't work, speak to a lawyer. Gather all your evidence that the money is yours including texts emails, dates of conversations etc etc", "NTA, but sorry to say, buddy, I'm 100% that money has gone. Your mum stole it", "NTA but I suspect she already spent all your money.", "Because it's a joint account it will be difficult to recoup this. Talk to a specialist but be careful lawsuits are expensive and you may pay a lot to get it back", "You need to sue her for the money. If you were awarded the money as a minor then she would have been expected to hand it over to you when you turned 18 if it hadn\u2019t all been spent on medical expenses. \n\nTake her to court and get your money she has stolen from you.", "NTA. Get a lawyer and press criminal charges against your mother for theft.", "I\u2019m sorry for what\u2019s happened to you and how your mom is acting but\u2026 if you\u2019re still financially struggling after 10 years 40k is not gonna help much. Seems like a lot of money but this day and age it\u2019s not. It would be a short term temp fix", "NTA, SUE HER ASS!!", "Nta you do realize she doesn\u2019t have the money anymore though? That\u2019s how she gets vacations and a nice condo.", "Your relationship is already beyond soiled. She trashed it and has absolutely no remorse.

I\u2019m just not sure I\u2019ll win in a suit because she was a signer on the account.\n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure if my family knows the extent of it.

Mom doesn\u2019t love OP, who steals from their child especially when they don\u2019t need the money and soap is struggling. Because of this theft OP had to move 5 hours away from mom so sees mom a lot less. Mom prefers $$ over seeing her child. It\u2019s disgusting. I hope OP comes to this realisation soon, that they are sadly holding onto a relationship that doesn\u2019t exist and sues.", "Could it be that it was simply a formality being that OP was underage at the time?\n\nEdit just realised she was 18 when she got the money.", "Do not bring it to her attention before talking to a lawyer.

And currently, she is right. \n\nShe feels no guilt over this, the sooner you realise that the better. . \n\n\nSorry if it seems harsh but you know what to do if you really want that money back, and that isn't being nice. \n\nMan/Woman/Person the fuck up! And then do what you need to do.", "Guilting her won't work. She's not guilty; she's living lavishly while you're struggling financially. She doesn't care about what you're going through. Take her to court. She deserves to be held accountable for her bad behavior. Even if you lose you'll be showing everyone what she did to you.", "It\u2019s been 10 years, clearly it won\u2019t work since she has no morals.

Stop asking her and get a lawyer it\u2019s the only way you will get your money.", "You're not crazy. I have a mother who does this sort of thing. I'm no-contact with her.  I understand that you don't want to mess up your relationship with your mother, but that's what she's doing already, by not letting you have money that is rightfully yours.\n\nDon't forget any of the paperwork that proves that the money should be yours. I'm sure you know this already, but I'm saying it, anyway. Get the bank statements that show when the money went into the account originally, and when it was withdrawn. Also, any legal documents pertaining to the original case, and any communications between the two of you, where you've had to ask for your own money. Print your text messages. If there have been any major purchases that she's made since removing the money from your account, you might want to take pictures of those things.\n\nI know that this isn't the right sub for me to be saying all of this to you, but I give relevant advice where I'm able.  \n\n\nEdit: Removed a redundant word.", "Pal, if my mom who I live dearly stole 40k from me?  I'd be dialing up Nicky Santoro Collections.", "You are absolutely not crazy. That is life changing money for you, and it's yours. Your mother already ruined your relationship, contact a lawyer. Possibly the lawyer involved in the original case would be able to clarify the terms of her ability to access the money. Good luck."]}
