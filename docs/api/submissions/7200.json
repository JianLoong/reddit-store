I signed a lease with a roommate and we subleased the third bedroom. But if I had to, I would have been able to cover the rent for the third bedroom, because you don\u2019t sign a lease you can\u2019t afford.

Forcefully holding onto your stuff that is not hers to force you to sign a piece of paper that would make you pay her money, I can't imagine that is legal at all.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You might get someone to video what you\u2019re removing so she doesn\u2019t come back later and say that you took some of her stuff.", "NTA. Get the bolt cutters and get you and your stuff out of there!", "NTA\n\nYou have given her 30 day\u2019s notice even without a formal lease.  \n\nContact law enforcement to confirm legality of cutting the lock (provide replacement and leave keys in locked apartment when you leave).  \n\nKeep copies of all communications and get it into a police report.\n\nSIGN NOTHING!!!   What she is doing is not legal and more importantly, not the action of a true friend.   I would say this friendship is over due to a loss of trust which you will never regain in the same capacity.\n\nBe sure to photo the storage area and apartment as it is when you returned and again as you left it (to include shot of new keys left in apartment).  \n\nI am sorry for the loss of your friend.", "I would advice against using bolt cutters.\n\nShe can turn that around on you and report you for theft.", "NTA\n\nBe careful of the bolt cutting, is it going to get you charges? A record is a hassle to live with. Check what you can do legally, and what you can live without.\n\nYou did give her one month notice. It was up to her to inform the landlord and leave with you if she can\u2019t afford that last month alone. Or ask the landlord if they\u2019d forgo part of the last month rent if she moves sooner? Some landlords will in goodwill and because it gives them a chance to already show the place before March, get a full month income then.\n\nGood luck, this isn\u2019t on you though.", "NTA. Get you and your things out before February. You've paid up Jan so if you or your things stay into Feb you will owe a partial amount. So get it all out now", " NTA\n\nGet the bolt cutters, open the unit, then cut her out of your life.", "NTA. She can\u2019t ask you to sign a contract after you have been living there, she should have done it before you moved in. Bad luck to her.", "NTA. The title is misleading lol. You don't have to pay the rent if you aren't staying there and have notified the roommate before. Take your stuff and leave. Do not sign anything.", "Absolutely NTA.", "She's blackmailing you, get the bolt cutters get your stuff and bring a friend as muscle in case she shows up. You have texts proving she's trying to extort you if she calls the cops. But if you involve the cops they'll tell you not to get involved because they won't want to deal with a \"civil\" issue", "NTA. She's trying to strong arm you into something that will make liable to pay more.\nGet the bolt cutters and liberate your stuff", "Why are you taking this so personally? You\u2019re all over this post responding to dozens of people. Why does it matter to you so much that you are trying to make OP feel like an AH?", "\u2026are you the ex-roommate?", "They don\u2019t have a lease, as she would be considered a month to month tenant. So she would only need to give 30 days notice which she has. So legally she\u2019s in the clear but her so called friend isn\u2019t and what she currently doing is theft.", "Yeah, I think involving cops is probably a good way for OP to cover their ass. The cops may not bother arresting the friend, but they will definitely supervise OP getting their stuff back and prevent the friend from being like \"that never happened, she just destroyed my property and stole my stuff for no reason.\"", "It's absolutely theft and extortion. She has taken OP's belongings away from her, and is denying her access until money is paid.", "Due to the fact that they had no renewed lease in place, they were in fact tenants-at-will. In most states in the U.S. either party (landlord or tenant) can break a tenancy-at-will agreement by giving 30 days notice. She did nothing legally wrong nor did she break a lease (there wasn\u2019t one in place) and she still offered to pay part of February\u2019s rent. NTA", "And the same is true for the other person - she made life plans without consulting OP, and OP did the same. Thus far, they are equal.\n\nThe shitty part is trying to get someone to sign on for more money after the fact, and then when they very reasonably refuse, stealing their belongings in order to extort the money from them - and yes, this is a crime!"]}
