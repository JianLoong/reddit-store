I have been living with my roommate for 2 and a half years and we made it through the pandemic as pretty good friends. Back story; When we moved in she signed the lease in her name only and the land lord told her if she wanted a roommate to figure an agreement out herself. The lease ended a year or so ago and she never resigned, she also never had me sign any leases or agreements in our 2 and half years. She found a job in a new city and told our landlord she's leaving in a few months. We live in an expensive city. Ive stayed for as long as I could but no longer afford it. My mum asked me to come home, in exchange for taking care of her dogs and some cleaning I wouldnt have to pay rent, I could continue looking for a job and save $. I told my room mate before new years I was leaving as I could no longer afford to live with her, I agreed to get my stuff out before Feb and payed Jan rent. She's moving in March and is still asking me pay 6/9 of rent for Feb. She's even written up an agreement and is asking me to sign it, which my whole family is telling me not to do. When I told her I was leaving **I even offered to send her some money for Feb depending on when I found a job and got my first paycheck cause I felt bad leaving her with out my usual share for the last month** and didn't want to strain our friendship. She kept asking me to sign and I kept diverting cause I was in another city and all my stuff was in our apartment and I was worried about her throwing stuff out if I straight up told her no. Well we still agreed on some days for me to get my stuff while she was out of town, I drove 11 hours in one day to find she'd locked some of my consoles into our storage unit (which also has my AC unit and some sports gear) and taken the keys with her. I called her and she she'd said express mail the keys if I agreed to sign or promise her Feb rent other wise she can't let me leave with all my stuff. I'm honestly thinking of getting bolt cutters, replacing the storage locks, leaving the new keys and just never talking to her again. But basically AITA for not paying rent I can't afford and moving out?\n\nEdit: Still not sure how this all works, this got a LOT more views than I expected. I bolded the part where I offered to send her money I don't have to. I still feel really bad but some people are saying I should forget that part now that she literally tried to extort me. I was also planning on trying to sell a few things and send her that (like the AC she locked away) I emailed our land lord to ask if she had keys, or if its ok to cut the locks and replace them. I've met her several times whenever there was maintenance to be done. She said go ahead and break the locks, our storage room is basically a long hall with cages in it and padlocks. I have broken and replaced the locks. I also recorded a phone call between us (legal where I live) and have a recording of her saying she'd express mail the keys only if she has some sort of promise she'll get Feb rent.
