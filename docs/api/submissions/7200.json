I signed a lease with a roommate and we subleased the third bedroom.

It wasn't my job to notify the apartment complex that someone who legally didn't live there was not going to live there anymore.", "You were month to month, you gave her notice before January 1st or on January 1st you did everything you are required to do.\n\nShe can not legally keep your stuff,  based on that if I were you I would send her a message saying\n\nWe were on a month to month verbal agreement I gave you a month's notice as is required by such agreement, you refusing to relinquish my things is against the law and I will get law enforcement involved if I have to, I will not be extending our agreement or signing anything.\n\nDo you agree to overnight the keys right now or not?\n\n\nIf she says no, contact the landlord and the police.\n\nThe problem with cutting the lock and replacing it is then you broke the law and she can claim you took her stuff.", "NTA and take your stuff no matter what right now while she is gone. I think you have a good plan.", "NTA Friendship be damned! Friends don't do this to you. It sounds like you behaved very civil. Boltcutters sound mild yet. I was thinking more along the line of police, hostage is one thing but if she moved the stuff out of your access it's not different from theft.", "NTA, depending on where you live you're a month to month tenant at best. You gave her notice. Keep all texts etc. Tell her you will call the police for theft or get bolt cutters, get your stuff, replace locks and leave the key.  \n\nEither way she cannot hold your belongings hostage. Ring landlord and tell them that you need the keys or request they come with the cops to get your stuff.", "Depending on your state the 30 days notice you have may or may not be valid. For instance, in several US states you are required to give a WHOLE 30 days notice. How that is interpreted is that say if you give notice on 1/5/23 that you want out, the notice period encompasses all of February because you gave your notice part way into January. She shouldn\u2019t be locking your things up. But the law might not be as on your side as you think.", "NTA. Sounds like she can\u2019t afford it either", "NTA.\n\nfor starters, she's not a good friend if she has to resort to storing your belongings in a storage unit until you sign an agreement that she made up on the spot. \n\nsecondly, it's not your fault that you weren't able to afford the rent in the apartment that she signed her name for in the first place. TBH, I don't think you should've even paid the rent from the beginning since you didn't sign your name on the lease as well, but that's just my personal opinion.", "NTA", "NTA--She is waiting to F-- you over. Get bolt cutters and get your stuff and don't look back. She should have made up a rental agreement when you moved in  and didn't. That is her loss.\n\nDon't sign anything and MOVE ON!\n\nShe isn't your friend.", "NTA. She doesn't have a leg to stand on, re the lease. You offered to help her out and this is how she repays you? She's not a friend. Cut the locks, get your stuff, block her number and don't pay her a cent.  \n\n\nMight pay to talk to the apartment owner/landlord before you cut those locks too. Show them the messages that she's holding your stuff, and take photos, so nobody can accuse you of stealing HER stuff.", "NTA.  Why should you have to pay for a month you won't even be there?  She has no right whatsoever to hold onto your personal belongings.  That's pretty much stealing.  I would definitely cut that lock, take my things and move on.", "She can't legally do that she is trying to make you sign under duress .  She stole your property, it's not a friendship.  Give her once chance before you call police", "A lot of storage unit places have bolt cutters and new locks right on site. I say this as someone who is really good at losing storage unit keys.\n\nBut yeah she\u2019s trying to extort you. She can go to hell.", "You gave 30 days notice, that\u2019s fair. You have no rental agreement. Plus she probably has paid a deposit which should cover last months rent.", "Absolutely NTA! Get your stuff and go NC. She is a conniving snake, holding your stuff hostage. DO NOT SIGN ANYTHING!", "NTA. Bolt cutters, get a new lock (or don\u2019t) and leave the keys (or don\u2019t). This friendship is basically over\u2026", "Wow, NTA and do are you say, bolt cutters, not locks, post her the keys and move on with your life. I'd block her if I were you cause she will blow up your phone and socials when she realises!", "Eh, don\u2019t bother with bolt cutters when a hammer to the side of the lock will often work just fine. Easiest way to open a Master lock is to bash it with another Master lock. Those things are junk lol.   \nGoogle \u201chow to open x brand lock\u201d and you\u2019ll find the simplest methods pretty quickly.", "NTA you basically gave her a month\u2019s notice when there was not even a proper agreement in place.\nYou could have just left but still did a decent thing.\nGet your stuff and block her. She may then decide to ask you for March rent too before giving it back", "Get the bolt cutters...do you think if you didnt have an option to leave in febuary and where stuck there that she would pay you aprils share?  I dont think so...NTA", "NTA and don\u2019t leave without your stuff", "NTA if you cut the lock out and retrieve your stuff. She's trying to steal from you. She's not your friend. She's TA.", "NTA. Grab the bolt cutters", "Cut the locks, take your stuff, and run.  NTA.", "Just to make sure I understand this correctly, the two of you were living in an apartment that was (after the initial lease) on a month to month tenancy. So there was no exact end time on a lease, just live there until you decide not to, correct? Because if so, then definitely NTA, not your problem that she needs an extra month to move out. Even if you signed any agreement with her it wouldn't actually be valid as you would be signing under duress, not to mention that you get nothing in the agreement so it wouldn't even be a valid contract, but I still wouldn't sign it. Threaten to take her to court, and if she doesn't budge, talk to the landlord to see if they can open the storage unit for you.", "NTA\n\nYou gave her more than 30 days notice and still offered to pay part of February. Get bolt cutter and get your shit. What she's doing is not legal. She has no formal contract between the two of you, you're not behind on rent and you gave a 30 day notice. Everything is in your favor.", "> Sign NOTHING keep records of all convos.\n\nProbably unnecessarily risky to rely on this, but shouldn't a signature obtained by extortion be completely void?", "Yeh I would screenshot the messages threatening to keep your stuff and video opening the storage with bolt cutters so it\u2019s all clear.", "This exactly. She can\u2019t just hold your stuff. If you had a prior agreement, maybe. But to try and make you sign it now. Nope.", "This! Do it OP. NTA", "\"It's a civil matter.\" A lot of y'all have way to much faith in the police. The only reason to get the police involved in this case would be to possibly file a report so there was at least a record of behaviour against OP's old roommate.", "\"Go to court, civil matter.\"\n\nJust get the bolt cutters and do it yourself at that point, file a report if you just want to create a record of behaviour.", "Yeah I agree with you, don't think it is as evil as people make it out to be. This friend is also just extremely worried about having to pay double price for two months because her roommate left early. Than again, she was also picking a date to move out without discussion so what was OP to do? Just pay to that exact date like a good little ATM?\n\nSo yeah, maybe just get your stuff and do a quick search online if there are people looking for short term rental and forward that to her (we once did that and it was okay, and nice extra 300 euro, but make sure you ask for a deposition even for short stay because people can suck)", "That is what a month to month is.  OP can leave with a month\u2019s notice.", "Depending on the state, if a resident contributes to the bills (rent, utilities, sometimes also includes common expenses like groceries, etc) they get tenant rights automatically and can't be kicked out without an eviction notice even without a written lease/rental agreement.", "Most states protect boarders for the period their rent covers... if you pay weekly you get a week's notice. Pay monthly you get a month's notice.   Without an agreement with the landlord I'd wager they r a boarder", "If you do this, be sure you have a witness videoing all you do in case she makes a claim against you (assuming there\u2019s anything else in there besides your stuff).  You don\u2019t want her claiming you took stuff that wasn\u2019t yours.", "Police will tell you that it\u2019s a civil matter and to take the person to court.\n\nAnd before I get a slew of comments saying that theft is criminal not civil, good luck getting a cop to act on it. If you know the person who has your stuff and are in contact with them, they really couldn\u2019t care less about helping you.", "Lol where do you live? I don\u2019t think that would happen with the police where I live.", "I didnt see month to month mentioned anywhere. I see that they didnt sign a new lease but that just means the landlord is trusting them. So yah its month to month on good will. So its really between the two roommates to coordinate. Moving out of a shared apartment is a joint decision. It sounds like the roommate decided to leave first, and then OP decided to leave as well but just a month earlier. Thats messed up. No one is gonna sign a one month lease so she\u2019s leaving her with the bag. All the people saying NTA are just saying it because she didnt sign anything and want her to take advantage of that. And while she SHOULDNT sign anything you shouldnt leave people hanging with a shared bill just because your name isnt on something. Especially when its only one more month. Sure you can give a landlord 30 days notice, but giving a roommate 30 days notice is an A H move IMO.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1 month is more than enough, given you had nothing signed.\n\nGo cut that lock, get your stuff, put in new lock and leave her a key (if you're nice), or don't, and let her figure it out, just like you did.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's Jan 13th, you paid for the full month, have every right to access your stuff.", "Not to mention cheaper than going to small claims court, since its against the law for her to hold your belongings hostage so you're forced to pay extra rent. If you haven't already, get her to say it through text message so you have what shes doing to you in writing", "Could be one that is uncuttable I\u2019ve seen a few that you just can\u2019t cut", ">but I wouldn\u2019t risk a police investigation over them.\n\nThey'll call, and ask OP about it, then tell the both of them it's a civil matter, and to deal with it themselves. What's the risk.", "Depending on the value of the consoles, what the roommate did could be considered anywhere from misdemeanor larceny to felony larceny.", "To be fair, the police would have to write a report of the interaction. That report could be used in civil court for various reasons. It can be used to prove the Respondent (the person getting sued) is being uncooperative. Or it can \"catch them in a lie\" if they tell the police one thing and OP has messages that show that they're lying, etc.\n\nIt's one of those times where it couldn't hurt. At worse, it doesn't do anything to improve the situation. But it could either get OP's stuff back or could be an official documentation/witness from a 3rd party that could strengthen OP's case in civil court.", "You're probably right but you never know. Plus extortion really changes things. My sister had something similar happen with a disgruntled roommate who wouldnt give back some of her clothes. (It was caused by an argument over my sister taking her kitchenware) My sister called the cops and the officer was kind enough to try and talk to the roommate but says his hands were tied for the most part. The roomie tried convincing him the clothes were hers even though they were clearly way too small. My sister is not skinny but the roomie was quite a bit larger. Luckily, she copped an attitude (as unhinged people tend to do), which pissed the officer off and he threatened to arrest her if she didnt give her clothes back.", "See my comment above! You never know unless you try. Sometimes crazy people like OPs roomie might piss a cop off enough for him to power trip in your favor.", "When you don\u2019t sign a lease you are on what is called a month to month lease.  It doesn\u2019t matter if you had a previous lease once that lease expires then unless you sign a new one it is a month to month.  It doesn\u2019t matter if \u201cthe landlord trusts them\u201d legally it is a month to month.  The roommate has no legal right to steal OPs property and hold it ransom until she pays rent.", "If that's the case they should try an angle grinder (grab a cheap one in the hardware) if they have a mate that's a builder good chance they have a ConSaw, now that beast would make mince meat of it.", "You might be right. It would be much easier and cheaper to get the bolt cutters.\n\nI\u2019m of the opinion that cops should be called as a last resort. OP has the means to get their stuff back, and they wouldn\u2019t be wrong to do it. The cops aren\u2019t necessary and would just escalate and complicate things.", "Yeah it\u2019s really not something I would rely on them for. Even in your sister\u2019s case the other party pissed him off, which is what motivated him to force the hand over.", "Lol right? They're expecting police to come out with bolt cutters and handcuffs over a \"he said she said\" situation over some property? Wow.", "OP didn\u2019t sign a lease at all! That was extremely foolish.", "I was thinking sawzall but yeah a consaw would definitely work lll", "You can rent stuff from HD, too.  Though maybe it\u2019s best to avoid that in case there\u2019s anything in the rental agreement about not destroying other people\u2019s property that could theoretically bite OP in the ass later.", "Yeah foolish on the roommate\u2019s part since she knew that OP could move out at anytime.", "It's not so the police will do anything, it's so there is a paper trail. Part of filing a police report is affirming that everything you have reported is true. Police reports carry more weight in court than other statements because if a false report is filed, there are consequences.", "There are different types of police reports, the kind that police write, which is what you are talking about, and then the kind that the public can file which is what everyone else is talking about.", "Op doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be on the lease if they pay any of the utilities, or their license has their current address on it, which considering he\u2019s lived there 2 years it probably does.\n\nNobody is breaking into anything, and the law IS on his side, that doesn\u2019t mean he needs police, by all means go ahead and call, they won\u2019t come out\n\nAlso OP does not have a copy of the contract, and it\u2019s stated he does not have anything in writing, it specifically says \u201cI called her\u201d, it was all verbal"]}
