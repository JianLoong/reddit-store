Her son is 21 and her daughter is 18 and both of them told her in the last month or so that they plan to legally change their names. My nephew is George and my niece is Katherine. The kids always had nicknames as kids and asked people not to use their whole names but it was was my niece who was the most vocal about the hatred she had for her name. She said Katherine made her think of the old lady who lived down the street from her and she felt like it was a really old lady name or a name someone who wanted to appear so mature would have. She wanted a name that sounded younger and in middle school she started to go by the name Ember, after a character she adored in a book. Ember has stuck and she plans to make that her legal name.\n\nGeorge was never as outspoken but in the last few years (mostly since he moved out of his parents house)he has been Ryder to his friends. Now he has decided he wants to make Ryder his legal name.\n\nMy sister was upset with one wanting to change but with both she's got a mix of sadness and anger about it. She and my niece have argued a lot. My sister told her wanting to sound young is a dumb reason to change her name. She told her the name Katherine has a lot of history surrounding it and sounds far more adult which she now is. She told her she just wants a trendy modern name and can't see the benefit to having a real name. She hasn't been as harsh with my nephew but she goes more for the guilt trips with him more so and she has tried with my niece too, just more with my nephew.\n\nIt got to the point that I heard from both my niece and nephew that their mom is driving them crazy and my nephew is considering changing his middle name like his sister plans to change hers, since their mom is being so extreme about this. My niece said she doesn't want either name her mom gave her and would rather have just a first name than carry around names she doesn't like.\n\nSo I decided to talk to my sister and she told me she doesn't want to hear what I have to say. She told me they are her kids and she has every right to try to convince them to do the right thing. I told her she should still lay off the guilt trips or she might find she hears way less from her kids than she does now and they might be less inclined to tell her stuff in the future, which she also wouldn't like.

She will continue to guilt her kids and they will change their name. You tried being reasonable but honestly there\u2019s no use with people like that. My mother is the same way. No one not even her calls me by my legal first name and I plan on changing it. I loath my first name it\u2019s so stupid and not one person can pronounce it right without me correcting them. My mom always gives me the most pathetic puppy dog look and tries to tell me it was my maternal great grandmother\u2019s name (no it wasn\u2019t, mom, not even your mom will allow that bs line). She\u2019s tried to convince me to keep it in the past but I threatened to cut her off. She finally got the hint and resorts to the face and white lie every time now. Which I\u2019m fine with because she won\u2019t change my mind.", "NTA, but I understand your sister's feelings. I gave my youngest a traditional name that I loved from both literature and history. She hated it. After she got her first job and saved up her money she asked us to sign the papers so she could change it. I felt bad on two counts because I really did love the name and I felt bad for giving her a name she hated. \n\nI can also relate to the other side. I hate, loathe, and despise my first name. Not even my own family can pronounce it or spell it correctly and to make matters worse it was the name of a very popular song back in the day that people used to sing at me whenever I introduced myself. Add to that the fact that my parents didn't really name me. They took the suggestion of family friends. \n\nSo, yeah, I get it and feel for both the parent and the kids, but if she really loves her kids she needs to accept what makes them happy.", "My perspective on names as a trans person (who named themselves something more similar to the names your niblings have chosen for themselves than the names they started with) is that names are a gift that parents choose for their children but that sometimes, like if the gift was something like a sweater, it doesn\u2019t fit or you outgrow it and you get a new one. When that gift is given with the perspective of wanting the child to have something they feel good about calling themselves, it might initially feel hurtful to hear that they chose poorly but they should ultimately be supportive of whatever new name feels comfortable.\n\nYeah, they are her kids and she has every right to feel her feelings but that does not mean she has the right to pressure or guilt them out of making a decision that feels right for them. You weren\u2019t crossing a line by telling her that her kids might not talk to her much if she keeps pushing boundaries, it was a warning coming from a place of caring about her having a future relationship with her kids and having the outside perspective necessary to see that her actions right now are damaging that possibility. Her reactions to their choice and your concerns makes me wonder if she\u2019s the type of parent to think of her kids as an extension of her that don\u2019t really have autonomy over their own lives and choices.", "Before I fully read this, I assumed your sister must have given them awful names with weird spelling or something really tacky or dated. So I was shocked to see two perfectly respectable names. Katherine has so many variations that could be used and George is also fine. \n\nOh well, everyone has the right to be happy with their names. It's their decision and the two of them that have to live with their names day after day. You are correct in telling your sister that manipulation and guilt aren't a healthy way of communicating, especially when the children are adults...technically. \n\nWhy technically? Well probably because they have chosen the most awful, fan-fiction/soap opera, childish and tacky names. Both names sound like what soap opera writers would use to introduce two new troubled teen characters to shake things up. Enter Ember! Ember is not like other girls. Underneath that cool reserve is the soul of a poet and a burning desire to prove herself. Don't forget to watch next week as we introduce Ryder. He is a bit of a maverick. He has a motorcycle and scowls a lot. He will have a dark secret which will be teased all season long only to end up being something disappointing and stupid.", "Nta but how does your niece and nephew dad feel about their changing their name?", "NTA - You were giving your  opinion.

His youngest daughter decided she was trans (she's not, just bi at this point) and he didn't give a shit, but when it came to the name change, he was very upset with it. His reasoning was that it was special to him and mother to get to name their child, and for her to change it would be disrespectful to them. He gave no shit about the trans stuff.

In truth, their new names would be fine, but their old ones would probably be slightly preferred in a more professional setting (if that is route in life they choose to take).  If your niece thinks Katherine is a \"really old lady name\" maybe have your sister show her pictures of Catherine, Princess of Wales or other well known Katherines, because I don't think most would consider it a \"really old lady name.\"  \n\nHowever, your sister needs to learn to pick her battles.
