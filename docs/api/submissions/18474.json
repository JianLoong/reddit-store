She got married and I came back a few days before the wedding to help her set everything up. We went to the grocery store and she bought $1700 worth of groceries as we were cooking it for the wedding. Her card was denied and she tried a few but they were all denied. We stepped aside and she called the credit card company to find out she nearly maxed out her cards. She started to panic and checked her accounts and found out she has $200 left in checking.

She did this to herself. \n\nNTA OP, and stop playing ATM for the family.", "NTA. You didn't make it *look* like she can't afford her own wedding because she *actually* can't afford her own wedding.\n\nSetting aside that weddings are already grossly overly expensive it's clear she didn't plan, save, or budget well for this. None of which is something you're responsible for. If the family is just going to treat you like a piggy bank then just removing yourself from the situation sounds like the best move.", "NTA. If your sister can\u2019t afford a wedding like what she has planned, then unfortunately she shouldn\u2019t be having one. It\u2019s not your responsibility to cover costs and potentially put yourself into debt for something that you don\u2019t want to pay for.", "NTA. You did the right thing. When you allow people to treat you this way, it never ends.", "NTA. I don't believe for a second that she didn't know that she didn't have enough money to cover $1700 in groceries.", "NTA. $1100 ain\u2019t just measly cash to spare. Your sister sounds delusional with finances.", "If she'd asked you for a $1700 wedding gift that would at least have been an honest request. Instead she tried to embarrass you in the grocery store line, assuming that you'd cave in.\n\nIt might help you to reframe this- your family isn't struggling with poverty - there are plenty of families living on low incomes- they're struggling with chaotic, dishonest relationships. I would think about what you are and aren't willing to do for them financially and then decide if you want to stay in contact. It's possible that they may not have the self control to respect any boundaries you set.\n\nNTA", "She didn\u2019t check beforehand to see if she had enough money for the groceries? This seems set up, and she probably thought she could con you into paying without having to ask for a loan.", "NTA - your family feels entitled to your money which isn\u2019t fair. Yes it would be nice to help your sister out but only if you offer. Being expected to pick up the bill basically says you\u2019re just a resource to them.", "NTA\n\nThey suck.\n\nPeople should stay the hell out of your wallet, family included.  It's not real hard for someone to look at how much money they have available before they start spending.  Probably lack of doing that is why she's in the position she's in anyway - lots of people get married on very, very small budgets.", "NTA Nope. $1100 is A LOT of money, and exactly no one is entitled to your earnings.", "NTA. A history of not paying money back. Unless you have it to give willingly. Don't get guilted.", "NTA you don't owe these users ANYTHING. Your sister should have planned better for HER wedding and not expected you to cover it", "NTA. Your family sees you as a walking ATM. You're not responsible for your sister's expenditures. Good for you for knowing your limits and not being afraid to say no. Just because you have a decent salary doesn't automatically negate your own living expenses, including debts. You also learned that loaning money to family means not being reimbursed, especially with relatives known to have extensive debts and maxed out credit.", "NTA - your sister literally couldn\u2019t afford her wedding, you didn\u2019t \u201cmake her seem like it\u201d, she truly couldn\u2019t afford it.", "NTA\n\nyour sister knew she didn't have the money, they were hoping you would foot the bill and got pissed when you refused. You're not a walking ATM. She has a whole husband, why isn't he helping to pay for the groceries?\n\nI would go LC with your family. Sometimes you have to love people from a distance", "NTA\n\nYour family seems to have a crab mentality. When a crab is placed in a bucket it can easily climb out and escape but when you add a couple crabs to a bucket, each time a crab tries to escape, the other crabs pull it back down so the entire group suffers. You\u2019ve managed to escape poverty and yet your family is trying to drag you back down with them. You worked hard for your money and your money does not equal their money. They only care about themselves and their image, they do not have your best interests at heart. Keep those solid boundaries and don\u2019t let them bully you back into poverty.", "NTA - You're not responsible for bearing the weight of your family members poor financial decisions.", "NTA, op, what a shame. You worked very hard to make a better life for yourself and your family is trying to turn a blessing into a curse. Your sister humiliated herself because she DIDN'T have enough money for the wedding and knew it. Best to start to distance yourself from them. Go l/c for a while and see if you can start to enjoy the fruits of your labor, you deserve it.", "NTA. At some point it has to stop. You don\u2019t owe them anything because they can\u2019t budget.", "NTA and if *several* cards were declined because she's maxed them out, she must have run up massive bills and is going to have her income taken up with interest payments.

Unless you have it in writing, it is impossible to get that money back. My grandmother was surprised when I started paying back her 'loan' for a new car she gave me. Most people just take the money and run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My sister demanded to see proof that I had maxed out my credit cards and I told her I don\u2019t have to give her proof I just don\u2019t have the money.\n\nYou don't need to provide proof. In fact, you shouldn't have maxed out credit cards period. You should be paying these off every month. So unless you had the cash, you are essentially stuck with paying the bill + interest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mom started on me too telling me that people are staring and people are going to gossip about this and I was humiliating my sister for making it seem like she couldn\u2019t even afford her own wedding.\n\nYour sister is marrying someone else right? Where are they and why can't they also contribute to the costs? The sister can elope or choose to have a more affordable wedding. Her wedding plans shouldn't be fronted by anyone else.\n\nDon't stress out about it. It (usually) isn't your responsibility to make others happy.", "NTA. You can spend your own money however you want. You aren't an ATM for your broke family members. You didn't embarrass anyone, they embarrassed themselves.", "No you shouldn't have. NTA, OP. Your family shouldn't think they're entitled to your money. That's unbelievably selfish on their end.", "NTA.\n\nThey don\u2019t see you as family anymore, just ATM.", "NTA\n\nThat is all.", "NTA\n\nPaying credit card interest rates for groceries that aren't even yours is foolish.  Unless you have the money to actually pay the bill off immediately, without interest, you can't afford that.  It would be the start of a trap. \n\nExpecting you to come up with over a thousand dollars with no warning, and apparently no intention or ability to pay you back before you start getting charged interest, is not something you should be putting up with.", "NTA.\n\n No one, NO ONE is entitled to YOUR money.  \n\nFamily that thinks you are gifting them money all the time is family you don't need. Cuz all they're going to do is keep coming and for more and more and more. Your parents already showed their entitlement by expecting you to pay for their expenses", "NTA. Obviously nobody else in your family is familiar with the word \"budget.\"", "\u201c\u2026for making it seem like she can\u2019t afford her own wedding.\u201d Well she can\u2019t. End of. NTA.", "NTA She had the same opportunity as you to go to college and leave poverty behind.  She should have planned her wedding and reception in a budget she could afford.", "NTA\n\nIf you give them money or put their expenses on your credit, you'll soon be as poor as the rest of your family.", "NTA. You were being set up to pay for it. Smart move on ditching them.", "NTA. They will always expect you to give if you do not put a stop to it now.", "M*om started on me too telling me that people are staring and people are going to gossip about this and I was humiliating my sister for making it seem like she couldn\u2019t even afford her own wedding*\n\nNice little staged drama to guilt you into coughing up - Your sister knew her card would be declined before leaving the house as she fully intended to stick you with the bill for her wedding food. If she cannot afford a wedding why is she having one?\n\nGood for you for not caving - you would have said goodbye to that 1100$ as well.", "NTA. NO ONE is entitled to your money.\n\nYour family treats you like an ATM, while you have a higher income you still have to worry about your own expenses and student loan. \n\nYou are right about your sister never paying you back. Having multiple credit cards maxed out is about the second worst financial decision one can make (short of a loan shark/payday loads). Someone who allow this to happen to their finances will likely not be able to pay you back even IF willing.\n\nYou did right to walk away, you didn't let someone else's bad financial planning/decision from ruining your own finances in form of credit card interest. in all honesty, if you let this happen once, your family will probably do it again.", "NTA\n\nDo you really think this was the last time IF you did help out.  You saw this was a non-ending problem you either accepted with the emotional blackmail or you walk away, come what may.  Now you have to decide if you're going to blink and go back.  Regardless, it's your money, they are demanding, entitled for no reason and don't respect what you have accomplished for yourself.  Good luck.", "Clearly NTA.\n\nBut you really only have 2 choices: go no contact with the family (as they're never going to change) OR resign yourself to being leeched dry by them. There's no halfway.", "Sounds like the whole thing was a set up, they knew their cards would be declined and was hoping you would step in and pay for them", "NTA - the absolute limit that someone may ask you to cover at the register is $80, and that\u2019s *the limit*.", "NTA. And it\u2019s a good thing you stood up for yourself when you needed too because you would have not only been expected to pay for the groceries, you probably would have also been paying the bill for plenty of other things associated with her wedding. It\u2019s time carry on like you have. You certainly don\u2019t owe them any financial support. If you\u2019re doing better, it\u2019s because you worked hard for it and that doesn\u2019t mean that you need to pad everybody else\u2019s wallets so that they can feel better about themselves too.", "Good for you!", "NTA. The bride is not entitled to your money, but there is also another issue here. Does her fiance know he's inheriting her credit card debt? She seems to have champagne tastes and a beer pocketbook, as the saying goes. She would have insisted you bail her out on a regular basis so her SO doesn't find out that she overspent again.\n\nMy sis in law asked me for $1,000 to bail out her daughter so that the husband didn't find out. I refused. There is no way I'm going to be in the middle of that. He has a right to know, even if it's not my place to tell him.", "Oh, I am very sure she was well aware that she couldn't afford $1700 for groceries, if she only had $200 checking and maxed out credit. She was trying to force you to pay up by putting you into that situation. NTA. I'd have left too.", "NTA I\u2019m seeing that as a planned shakedown, not an emergency. She had to know she was low on money/credit especially since she was off by $1500. There\u2019s no way she thought she had that much and they probably figured it wouldn\u2019t hurt to spend more elsewhere because you\u2019d be there to make up the difference if it came down to it.  I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t have a decent relationship with your family at this time, but you know the demands would have kept coming.", "NTA. The point of raising a child is so that they can go off and live their own life not so that you can have a permanent free ride through life yourself.", "Mum, I didn't make her seem like anything. She can not afford what she is trying to buy, that's a fact, and I am not a bottomless pit for her or your financial whims. \n\nNTA. Stay strong and consistent. No means no, not ' let's negotiate'.", "You should cut contact with all the leeches. NTA", "NTA, your sister can\u2019t afford her wedding.  It\u2019s not in you to pay for it.", "NTA, but you will be one to yourself if you continue this.\n\nYou are a person, not an ATM. They don\u2019t need a safety net - it\u2019s time they pay for their excessive overspending.\n\nI\u2019d cut them off, go no contact. And stop lending them any of your hard-earned money. They do not appreciate it and only see it as their entitlement.", "\"I was humiliating my sister for making it seem like she couldn\u2019t even afford her own wedding.\"\n\nSeem like? She couldn't. She probably knew she couldn't, as well. They were setting you up to pay for the wedding she couldn't afford to have, without even the decency of asking. Like, think about it, she's maxed multiple credit cards and only has $200 in her checking account and just didn't know that? *Multiple cards???* I worked retail way too long, the people who show up with a ton of stuff and have multiple cards decline and can't get their stuff always, always know because they always do the same thing every time, and always look around for someone else to foot the bill. \"I swear I had money on this card\" when we're on card 7 just isn't very convincing when I've seen them do it once a week for the last 6 months.\n\nSister is just very fiscally irresponsible and instead of doing anything differently, wants to keep being irresponsible and rely on others to bail her out. \n\nYou're NTA, they're adults who would rather pass the bill to someone else and continue to be irresponsible than leanr to be responsible.", "NTA: Had you paid to \"keep the peace\" then what? They'd expect it the next time, and the next, and the next. You're putting up a boundary, and putting a stop to them thinking you'll pay for everything. If you're uninvited just because you wont pay for her then I think it's what's best for you to put some distance for the time being. It's food for a wedding, and a wedding is a /want/ not a need.", "NTA you are not an ATM", "NTA, you're doing what you had to so that you can take care of you first.

You are being emotionally manipulated by everyone, gaslighted, and your emotions are being dismissed. It's serious!", "NTA but is your middle name ATM?", "NTA. Don't pay for anything else, period. You are just a paycheck to them.", "NTA\n\nShe totally set you up. She knew her cards were maxed out and figured you'd step up and pay.", "NTA No you shouldn't have because it will never stop. You will be asked to piggybank everything.", "NTA. That was a well thought out scam your mom and sister tried to pull on you.", "NTA -- I love it when people volunteer someone else.  \"You need money?  Well your sister can pay!\"", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re headed in the right direction though. It\u2019s tough to cut toxic people out of your life, but almost always worth the initial strife. You\u2019re pulling yourself out of the trailer park and they\u2019re trying to pull you back in. Get out and don\u2019t look back.", "NTA.\n\nThey knew they didn\u2019t have enough and set you up.", "Definitely NTA.  I will never understand the mindset of entitlement amongst families when one is successful.  You worked for it. You earned it. You owe them nothing.", "NTA.  I recommend distancing yourself from this part of your family.  They appear to view you as a resource rather than a relative.  You don't owe them anything.  \n\n\nMy family was like this. No one ever had money they were always short or borrowing and not paying back.  I worked really hard, went to school, got a degree and then got a good paying job.  I used my money and resources wisely. I didn't spend all my money on cigarettes and lottery tickets. I only bought stuff that I absolutely needed and paid off my debts first before I went to the bar or paid for my wedding.  I also made a budget for my wedding and stuck to it.\n\n\nIf they try to get money from you again I personally would go no contact. However you can also approach it by asking them what's wrong that they can't budget their money?  Tell them if they sign over every penny they ever get to you you'll be more than happy to manage it for them and ensure that their bills are paid, because clearly you know how to manage money but they don't.", "YTA. Bigtime. Some brother you are.", "Shaking my my f-cking head?", "Exactly. It\u2019s weird how this family feels entitled to OP\u2019s money.", "I got engaged in December. My partner and I just got a house with the help of my parents so we're postponing our wedding for at max 2 years and if we don't have the money saved up by then we're probably just going to to the court house and having a party instead of doing the whole ceremony and reception. I would like to be able to have a ceremony and reception for my first, hopefully only,  marriage, but if we can't afford it then it's not necessary. I don't even want an extravagant wedding , but we both got a lot of family/friends to invite and I want at least a decent location to hold it and tasty food. I can't imagine planning a wedding without having the funds and then demanding someone else to pay for their own poor planning.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My sister demanded to see proof that I had maxed out my credit cards and I didn\u2019t have any money in my checking\n\nAlso this irked me so mcuh. Like just cause I got money in my account doesn't mean I have money to spend freely. I gotta pay my bills, rent, and necessities.", "Putting your foot down at the expenses for a wedding is a good time to start distancing yourself from the family. They are going to continue to be parasites on your financial wellbeing.", "Right? And to only have $200 in her account? If you worry about money you check that kind of stuff before you go out and spend.", "Absolutely a set up. OP is the family's ATM.", "She knew she was going to be making a massive purchase, no one plans to buy $1700 worth of anything without making sure they have access to that kind of money or credit available, especially when they\u2019re right in the midst of planning/paying for something as expensive as a wedding. There\u2019s no way sis didn\u2019t expect her to step up and pay and chances are mom was in on it too.", "This, for sure. Maybe if they'd asked in advance OP might have helped out, but putting OP on the spot like that? Bad, bad form, and manipulative af.", "How long, I wonder, before OP hears \"you're gittin' above your raisin' \" which is basically jealousy from someone who isn't willing to work as hard as you did to better themselves.", "I'm sorry, $80 seems both arbitrary and specific.  How did you arrive at $80?", "She is sister not brother  , read properly", "shaking my MFing Head", "Shaking my mulleted f ing head", "Step merry my friends, hazah!", "Probably shaking my motherf*cking head", "Motherfucking head.", "I think its \u201cShaking my mf-ing head\u201d", "Exactly, sister gets to spend her money on a wedding why can't OP spend her money on whatever tf she wants?", "> Like just cause I got money in my account doesn't mean I have money to spend freely. I gotta pay my bills, rent, and necessities.\n\nWell it doesn\u2019t seem like the sister understands budgeting, whether her own or OP\u2019s.", "And add up as you go to not go over.", "2x my smallest monthly recurring bill is the largest amount I would expect someone to be able to pay me back. I rounded up to $80 from there.", "No, definitely mullet, given the context.", "No, I don\u2019t want to is also another perfectly acceptable and valid reason."]}
