I don't want anyone to bring meat into my house, when I got into a relationship with Mar, he became vegetarian. As a result, when the kids are here, the meals I cook for them contain no meat. Damon had no problem with it up until now, he complains at every given opportunity about the lack of meat. I've explained to him that eating meat is non-negotiable, he can eat it at his mother's. His father backed me up. I've tried to compromise by buying him 'beyond meat', but he still insists on actual meat.\n\nAnother thing is that my husband is very affectionate to me and the kids, although Damon being 15 is embarrassed by that. The younger two always climb onto our laps for hugs, and Alma always wants to be carried around on my hip.\n\nI don't speak to Christine much, we're not on very good terms as she has been homophobic to me in the past and critical of my former job, so I was surprised when she wanted to speak to me when I dropped her kids off at her home. She demanded that I don't 'push' vegetarianism on her kids, to allow them to eat meat in our home, to which I told her that I don't dictate what food she cooks in her house, so she shouldn't do so to me. She also stated she was uncomfortable with Alma calling me 'daddy' and the affection I show to her kids.\n\nAsides from being vegetarian, I tried to respect her wishes and discourage Alma from calling me 'daddy' and I stopped letting her and river climb onto my lap or hug me. That didn't work out very well and I was left to deal with 2 confused and upset little kids to comfort, therefore I decided to go against their mother's wishes and let them carry on doing what they're used to. I feel conflicted because their mother's wishes have been disrespected, but at the same time, I'm just doing what's best for the kids, not what's best for her.\n\nedit ; idk why everyone assumes Damon is outright banned from meat, he does eat meat when he goes out with his father or his friends. shit, I even pay for it when he goes out to eat. the smell of meat nauseates me for a variety of reasons\n\n2nd edit : whoever the fuck is sending me messages making fun of my dead child, you are bottom feeders.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1704413250, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yseag/aita_for_disrespecting_my_husbands_exwifes_wishes/", "score": 659, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have become a part of their life as you married a man with 3 children. It is a family home, and you don't realize that calling it MY home in front of Damon really makes him feel like a guest.\n\nSince you get to be a SAHM and not a bartender, life is easier for you, but damn sure the ex-wife's life is not easier. It sucks that she is homophobic and I really think she is just that way with you!  You have stepped into her life. You get to spend time with the kids, like almost raising them bc you don't have to work and can concentrate on your art.\n\nShe doesn't want extra money from your husband. She wants to support herself bc she has been humiliated her in front of every person in her life. She has taken a blow to her dignity, but no, you don't see it that way. You want her to be like you, living off her ex-husband. You look down on her for working. \n\nHer homophobic actions are never acceptable, so I am no way excusing it. It's just something to think about bc she has nothing left to hurt him with. \n\nNow, back to your nausea over meat, you owe it to your family to be flexible. You are extremely selfish in that you don't consider anyone else's feelings, wants, or needs.  Just yours, and that is all that matters. You can play my house my rules as a selfish person of the word MY, but since HIS son is pulling away and is at an age where he doesn't have to go his father's home, your husband is going to resent you for burning a bridge with his son.

Why not buy a microwave for his room to heat up his meat?

What will happen when the children start to realize that the only reason they spend so much with you is because mommie doesn't take any of their daddy's money to live?

It's restrictive, but it's not unreasonable or uncommon for people with dietary restrictions.\n\nYou got married pretty fast, but plenty of people do. There is nothing wrong with getting married if you are in love. And there's nothing wrong with starting a relationship with someone who is separated (unless you are leaving a lot out).\n\nWould it have been more respectful to either not start a relationship, and either pretend you aren't attracted to each other and basically lie about it or to have missed the chance at a relationship entirely? Would it have been more respectful to get into a relationship and lie to her about it and pretend you don't exist, instead of help her in the ways you could? \n\nI am totally baffled at the amount of people saying you're the asshole. But someone else said something that's true. Look at how many people are incensed at the idea of not letting a child bring meat into one of their part-time homes. Lots of people care way, way too much about being able to eat meat. It's silly, it's ridiculous, but they are weird about it. So it is possible/likely that the eldest will resent it, because he seems to feel that way, and you're going to have a worse relationship with him as a result if you keep preventing him and fail to come to some accord.\n\nAnd something else to consider about the relationship with him. He was much older when the divorce happens, and he might feel weird or upset about the situation. He might even resent you and blame you for the divorce, even if that's not the case. But, that situation is still new, and teenagers can be extremely emotional and unreasonable at times. You don't need to let him have meat in the house, especially if it causes you issues. But, you might want to think about how you can warm that relationship. It might also be that the boy just needs some time. This has certainly been quite a lot of change for him, and he probably still misses the family life he had while his parents were together.\n\nThe ex is just upset (reasonably and understandably) about the situation. She might not even be (or have been previously) homophobic, but she is perhaps furious about your very existence. That's not likely to change. So she is not likely to stop being hateful to you. You can decide to just let it slide, or make an issue of it, but she resents you, and that's not likely to change. It might hurt your relationship with everyone else if you make an issue of it. \n\nBut absolutely don't let her dictate anything that goes on in your home. You treat the children how you have been, if they are happy with your as one of their dads, you are doing a good job. You and your husband are the only ones who get to decide how to deal with the kids while they are in your home, unless you are feeding them unhealthy foods or otherwise harming them or their quality of life.

This is something Mar needs to work out with Christine. If I were her, I would take this to Family Court and petition for an increase in child support if he can afford for you to stay home and she has to work two jobs. Something is off balance there that needs to be corrected.

This hill you want to die on could cost him time with his son (and potentially younger children) if it continues to be an issue. An animal\u2019s death for consumption is not worth that. Have separate pots and pans and plates and make Mar shop for the meat and teach his son how to cook it while in your home. You don\u2019t have to be a participant to allow their children to feel comfortable and welcome. You aren\u2019t a Muslim being asked to make bacon or an Orthodox Jew being asked for a cheeseburger. You should relax your stance a bit and accommodate. \n\nShe and Mar were deeply hurting. Try to empathize with her. You\u2019ve taken over the life and role she wanted and thought she\u2019d always have. She lost it all. She birthed those children and is killing herself working to watch her ex\u2019s affair partner raise her children. Goodness, I hurt for her. Hurt people hurt people. I don\u2019t believe parents should alienate affection from people their children love, and they clearly love you, but only Damon is old enough to remember having his family ripped apart with nary a second to process before his father moved on into a gay relationship. The very fiber of his being was ripped out from under him, and he\u2019s a 15yo kid who just has to \u201cdeal.\u201d Of course he\u2019s going to feel different about you. Of course it\u2019s going to hurt her to see how much they love you, logic aside, feelings are feelings. She shouldn\u2019t dictate what they children call you or how you treat them in your home, but can you step outside yourself for a moment and understand how she may be resentful of the close relationship you have with their children because you have the luxury of time that she doesn\u2019t have and why she doesn\u2019t have it? Do you not think she wants more time with them if she could afford it? Don\u2019t you think it would be beneficial for her to have more time to spend with her kids so she doesn\u2019t have to be in a position to resent you? Mar needs to pay more, a lot more. \n\nMar hid who he really was for a long time, and closeted is no way to live life. Many gay men (even bi) in Mar\u2019s position end their lives rather than stay closeted and come out. That\u2019s not healthy and coming out was the right thing to do, aside from horrendous timing. I can\u2019t speak for his headspace when cheating while his wife was pregnant, but hurt people do hurtful things from places of great pain. I\u2019m not saying he should have stayed married because she was pregnant. I\u2019m not even suggesting he ended the relationship with you, but he should have let the dust settle and gotten into family therapy and given his children time before introducing you into their lives and letting you take over parenting like his ex was some kind of lesser surrogate or incubator. \n\nLike it or not, you are an affair partner. You are complicit in how and why her life is what it is now. You played a part in hurting her, and it hurts Damon to see his mom hurting. You bear responsibility for the collateral damage, and you should help clean it up. Let the kids eat meat. Acknowledge your role in causing her pain. Apologize sincerely and ask Mar to pay up.

In the case of food, which is the most common usage of the word, that means the rules on dietary restrictions.\n\nFirst of all, you have a division between foods which can be kosher and those which never are. The latter incudes, for well-known examples, pork and any  animal seafood except for scaled fish. Anything which includes or was cooked with non-kosher products (e.g. lard) is not kosher. On the other hand, plant-based foods are pretty much always kosher.\n\nThen you have a division of foods into the categories of meat, diary or parve (neither of the previous two). Food that combines meat and diary is not kosher, and the rules also require a separation in time between eating milk and diary.\n\nThere's also a \"contamination \" issue. Otherwise kosher food becomes non-kosher if it's prepared with, eaten with or comes in contact with dood, surfaces, utensils and so on which were used with non-kosher food - or diary which came in contact with meat or vice versa. Obserant Jews will have two sets of dishes, utensils, appliances - even kitchens in wealthy or indtitutions  - for meat and diary to prevent this. If any of these become \"contaminated \", they may or may not be able to be \"kashered\", the process depends on what they're made of.\n\nBeyond that, for meat to be kosher, there are rules as to how it's slaughtered (fish don't count as meat for purpose of kosher rules), which includes a blessing. There are a few other foods (e.g. milk and wine) which have special rules as well.\n\nOther than meat and kashering, you don't actually need a blessing for something to be kosher - it is or it isn't. \n\nBecause of all of these requirements in both what the food contains and the environment in which it's prepared, many observant Jews will consider all food (except maybe raw fruit and such) nonkosher unless it's prepared by a trusted source or has been certified kosher by a trusted organization.\n\nAll of the above, mind you, are the basics.

Told you could eat vegetables outside the house but not in?", "It's absurd to make this comparison. Damon isn't coming over to babysit for a few hours. He lives there too. Huge difference. He's not a guest.", "That\u2019s completely different. You voluntarily chose to work there, and you get to quit if the dietary rules were a dealbreaker for you. Plus, you probably only had to stay there for a couples hours at the most, maybe overnight. \n\nDamon doesn\u2019t have the choice to leave, he\u2019s forced to live there for half of the next 3 years. And until he\u2019s old enough to drive, he has no way to get his own food.", "and this was a rule that affected you, not them. They were raised without stuff you wanted to bring in, they weren't missing anything.", "OMG,  that makes it double worse bc his husband was paying for OP'S love and affection. How much did you require him to pay you to see you outside the club, dinner, time, and God knows what else.  Why doesn't he tell Damon how they met?\n\nIf the gender were reversed and OP was a woman, every reddit poster would be screaming gold digger! Did he make you sign a pre-nup? \n\nYou are such an invasive person, invasive means a being that is not natural to habitat who destroys the original inhabitants, which is somewhat what you are doing. Don't come to reddit with half truths and expect people to validate your lies.", "My daughter has a fridge in her room because there are items which need refrigeration which are solely for her.

I really should have said \u201ciron\u201d rather than protein. I just hope these two AH\u2019s are giving all kids a well balanced diet", "I\u2019d argue OP is on shaky ground because his house is also Damon\u2019s home and Damon has no choice in the matter. And with Damon at 15, OP as a relative newcomer to his life is late to be imposing his own moral framework on the kid. \n\nI think the OP is fine in refusing to cook meat or even in objecting to people eating it in his presence. But at 15, Damon should probably have enough autonomy to eat meat in his own home at least in some circumstances. I\u2019d recommend OP and Damon work out some kind of ground rules that allow Damon to eat meat when OP is not around. \n\n\u201cNot in my presence\u201d is more defensible (although honestly, I think even that is a recipe for a bad relationship as a step parent). \u201cNot in my home\u201d begs the question- why isn\u2019t this Damon\u2019s home too?", "Because it's not just \"their\" house. It is also Damon's house. He wants meat! He isn't hurting OP by wanting to eat a burger. He can cook his own food. What's going to happen is he will spend less and less time at home and more and more at his friends' houses.", "So? I used to work for a Muslim family & I ate bacon at their store all the time. The family knew I had different beliefs & it was all good. They didn't try or want to control me, even though I was an employee at the store they owned. By your logic, it's perfectly okay for parents to kick out their LGBT kids if it goes against their beliefs, since it is their house after all.", "Because its not his house. He is an affair partner who has uprooted the life of this boy and is now forcing his own rules on him, who has lived there his whole life.\nThats like ME going to YOUR house and saying that there MUST be bacon on every meal or else.", "The kids live there too. It's their home. They are already dealing with a divorce and then they gotta change how they are allowed to exist in their house. This isn't gonna end well. It's sad. OP is the AH.", "Because it is, and should be recognized as the CHILDREN'S HOUSE FIRST AND FOREMOST!!  \n(I intend to elaborate, but am ill, and just rest first ;)\u2764\ufe0f)", "This is the crux. OP left out the timeline on how the divorce went, how kids were introduced to him, did kids & Mom know about Dad being gay or bi, and if the kids were forced to move out of their house into OP's or if OP has moved into theirs. How long have the kids known OP?  There are bigger issues to handle, and the fact that someone married to Dad for just a few short months is main caregiver is a big one. The kids aren't used to it and Damon is naturally uncomfortable because of all these abrupt changes thrown in his face. Was enough child support and spousal support offered from the parent who makes more money to the parent who makes less in order to allow a bio parent to be main caregiver? The kids want to and need to be with their parents most because they are going through a big trauma. Even a relatively peaceful divorce and remarriage really causes deep pain for kids. OP is glossing over that skillfully. \n\nFrom the info given, kids are probably not having much choice in any matter, Dad isn't communicating with kids well, communication has probably broken down between Dad and Mom, and family therapy probably needs to happen for healing. My guess is that one of the parents refuses to go.", "I'm bi and I'm leaning this way. Children do not belong on vegetarian diets unless they're getting complete proteins and supplements, which is a privileged and difficult to achieve thing. I'd bet money OP was not a nutritionist or a dietary expert in his pre-house husband life. This shole thing stinks of power & control issues. Christine could've said homophobic things and not been a dedicated homophobe (straight cis ppl left by bi mates often do, even if they were accepting when they were together), but not keeping some fucking hotdogs or frozen burger patries for a 15 year old in the throes of hormonal teenagehood while he's trying to navigate what sounds like a -very- complex new family arrangement is just a power issue. \n\nIt's developmentally appropriate to rebel regardless of family dynamics at 15. Add a broken marriage, complicated sexual dynamics (for most straight people; for us gays, this isn't even close to complicated), and his siblings being much younger means this boy is probably very lonely, very sad, and is now being forced to eat (disgusting) fake meat instead of the one thing he might have been able to rely on for normalcy & consistency. \n\n[A tip, btw, the fake chicken from Quorn cooks and feels and tastes more like real chicken, especially the diced chunks cooked into sauces. Morningstar is gross with all yheir products & Beyond stuff is way less convincing, and I've never had beef or pork crumbles or patties that actually feel or cook like real meat. The Beyond ground is close in sauces, but unless you salt & spice it, it's very obviously not meat.]\n\nOP, if you see this, read a parenting book about family dynamics & blended families please and start peeking in to gay parent tiktok to see if there are any creators with blended straight and queer families for tips. And ask yourself, at the end of the day, is it more important for him to have developmentally appropriate care and feel like you -do- love or care for him, or are *your* arbitrary diet choices unnecessarily impacting your only chance to bond with this boy who will be a man in less than 3 years?", "So every separated couple who is seeing other people are cheating? In some places there is a forced separation before you can proceed with divorce...", "I\u2019m not amazed he got custody.

It would be one thing if OP was vegan, but vegetarian is really hard to not get the proper nutrition if they are eating regular meals.", "Why calling OP, who is married to the child's father, \"bang mais\". I'm Very curious why you felt the need to use this desumanizing term...", "I think you brought up the relevant point. This isn't a rule Damon has lived with his whole life. This person who has only been in his life a relatively short while has imposed this on him, at an age where he is needing more protein and calories to boot. NOT cool.", "Wait...

Gender and sexuality has been given a very narrow path to walk in Western cultures, and the effects of finding yourself outside of that narrow path - especially when you\u2019re already an adult or even have adult children - have huge impact on your family.", "They are bottom feeders and that is not Kosher.", "Probably impossible to prove either way but I've always thought the main reason both Jews and Moslems both avoid pork and try to bury their dead in under 24 hours is because of the climate in the Middle East.\n\nPork in particular goes bad very quickly compared to beef etc, and the burying bodies quickly in 40 degree heat needs no explanation...\n\nBoth religions are also instructions on how to live and it's easy to see how practical aspects of life in a hot climate with little water could become codified, especially well before the germ theory of disease etc.", "Yeah apparently some fundie christians advocate for following a kosher diet. I sincerely hope they aren't wearing a *cotton blend t shirt* while doing so!", "Thank you and yes I agree!", "Ecxept pigs were first domesticated in the Middle East, and I doubt that would have happened if pork really was a health hazard. From what I've been told by Jewish people, all those rules around food were instead a way of setting their ancestors apart from other Caananite tribes in the area. And considering that they were mostly pastoralists who hearded goats and sheep and lived away from the ocean, it wasn't all that much of a hardship. \n\nIslam borrows heavily from Judaism and inherited the ban on pork from there. \n\nThe part about a swift burial though, that I believe. Although once again, it's probably something Islam got from Judaism.", "Or *lusting after their neighbor's wife*."]}
