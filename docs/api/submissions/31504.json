If people want to bring something, they are welcome to, but not expected. I usually say they can bring a dessert or an appetizer. We always have plenty of wine, beer, juice, iced tea, soda, water, coffee & tea. \n\nThis year my BIL asked to host Thanksgiving at their house. My husband and I said sure, we were happy to take a year off from cooking. \n\nBIL sent out an email to the group - our family and his - saying how excited they were to host this year and that he'd be making two turkeys and cranberry sauce. That's what he'd be making for Thanksgiving dinner hosted at his house. He said his mom was bringing cole slaw and a dessert, and my sister was buying some dessert. He then listed sides  he \"might\" make, or others could bring. He said to let him know if you'd like to bring something on the list, or not on the list. The list included stuffing, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, gravy, rolls and four vegetable dishes (corn was *not* on the list). \n\nBIL said they'd have iced tea, ice water, soda, tea, and beer. No wine, no juice for the kids. If you want coffee, they'd need a volunteer for that - they have a coffee machine, but you'd have to bring \"coffee, filters, and etc.\" \n\nOK, I'm trying to be gracious so I was the first one to respond, saying I'd bring stuffing (fwiw, everyone loves my stuffing) and a side dish not on list but that my son loves and requested (as did my mom). Somebody volunteered to bring mashed potatoes so I figured it would be fine - my kids can survive on turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing and my side dish. I can bring juice & wine. \n\nRec'd update email - BIL is making twice baked potatoes & the 4 vegetable dishes haven't been claimed, but not too late to volunteer. \n\nSister calls me to ask if we were bringing our dog. I said of course not, we'd already made arrangements for her. Anyway, since she called, I asked about the twice baked potatoes, so she puts BIL on the phone - she has no idea what food they're having. I asked if there would be mashed potatoes - he said no, it would be twice baked potatoes. I said I may bring some mashed potatoes for the kids. He said he could do some plain twice baked, but I said I'd just bring mashed - the kids wouldn't eat the twice baked. \n\nOkay, not sure if kids would eat the twice baked, but I *need* and *want* regular mashed potatoes (and corn) at Thanksgiving! So, in order to *not* host this year, I'll be bringing stuffing, my side dish, mashed potatoes, corn, wine and juice. \n\nAITA for being irritated that Bill asked to \"host\" Thanksgiving, then asked for volunteers to do the majority of the meal, made no effort to consider what food/drinks my kids (or other guests) would like/eat and can't be bothered to buy wine, juice and coffee/coffee filters?", "created_utc": 1700665598, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/181b75d/aita_for_expecting_my_bil_to_cook_the_meal_for/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Those are your requirements. YTA. Learn how to compromise. Not everyone likes what you and your kids like", "YTA.  Your idea of how to host Thanksgiving dinner and your BILs don't perfectly match up, that's fine.  You prefer to make every dish for dinner, that's fine but there's nothing wrong with asking if others are bringing anything/if anyone would mind taking one or two dishes.  You said he's making 2 Turkeys, cranberry sauce, twice baked potatoes and 4 veggie sides.  That's a full meal, I'm not seeing the issue?  You want mashed potatoes and corn.  OK.  So what?  He's not offering those.  It's his house, he's hosting, he's set his menu...  You want these things and are bringing them.  Also fine.  As to the wine/coffee/juice thing this is also not a big deal.  It's a tiny bit unusual at most not to have wine but given the pot luck nature of the extended elements of the meal it's reasonable.  He's being very clear with what he's got and he's clearly not being cheap or skimping on the work.  The fact that you'd offer a larger spread is a decision you make.  Don't judge him for wanting to do it his way.", "YTA. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with asking people to bring a side. He asked you to bring one, you\u2019re choosing to bring 4-5. That\u2019s on you. \n\nHe also didn\u2019t ask that you bring several drink options. That\u2019s also on you. \n\nYou\u2019re the problem here. You seem to think that everyone else should host the same way you do. Get over it. \n\nIt\u2019s fine not to like it. It\u2019s even fine to bring additional sides because you want them. It\u2019s not fine to bitch and moan about it as though he\u2019s doing something wrong. This is a problem you\u2019ve created.", "YTA.

Zero effort to grab a bottle of each and bring them.  I often ask guests to bring beverages and desserts so they can just pick them up on the way. \n\nYou really would have hated the year I did an Italian style Thanksgiving with lasagnas, sausage and peppers, antipasto, appetizers\u2026. No Turkey or corn or potatoes in site.  \ud83d\ude02", "YTA. Your way of hosting isn\u2019t the only way. You chose to provide everything, he\u2019s choosing to host a potluck style gathering. Both ways are perfectly fine. If there are things you would like to have at the dinner, you are free to bring them and it doesn\u2019t sound like your sister and BIL would be offended if you did. It sounds like the reason you like hosting so much is because you like having things your way. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if one of your sister and BIL\u2019s motives for offering to host this year is because you can be controlling and they would prefer a more easy going experience.", "YTA\u2026you need to chill and let BIL do his thing\u2026.remember just because he differs from your idea of menu/serving does not in any way make it wrong\u2026let him host without your side of judgmental bias", "YTA. Oh my God, are you the AH.\n\nYou lost me early on, but then solidified it with your martyred sighs about corn. Not to mention that double-baked potatoes are not only freaking delicious, but they essentially just mashed potatoes if you take them back of the skins, so you\u2018re being twice-baked ridiculous about how your precious kids couldn\u2019t adapt for one day in their lives.", "YTA.  When you host, do it your way. You're not hosting this year.", "YTA. \n\nJust because you didn't choose to do a potluck Thanksgiving doesn't mean he has to do the same. Just because you like mashed potatoes doesn't mean he has to cook them. You can bring some wine. So you'll have turkey, potatoes, cole slaw, cranberries, desserts, wine, etc. It's a meal, even if it's not your ideal meal. The not having coffee and juice for the kids is kind of odd, I will admit. \n\nMy partner and I are vegetarians. We had to make ALL the side dishes for every holiday meal for years (whether or not we hosted), or bring our own food, or we couldn't eat anything. We eventually stopped going; we make a wonderful meal for ourselves, and eat the leftovers for the next many days. If holidays are too stressful for you or there are too many expectations on you, stop doing them.", "As someone who has always had to cook my own sides for Thanksgiving just to ensure I have something to eat, YTA. When you want something specific that isn't offered, you bring it yourself. Not make a stink about it.", "YTA-Just because it\u2019s not being done your way doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. If it bothers you that much tell him you\u2019re hosting again next year.", "YTA\n\nSounds like he\u2019s making lots of effort to be a good host, he\u2019s just not doing it exactly how you would.  Adjust your expectations and enjoy your family as that\u2019s what the day is about.", "- If you didn\u2019t see corn on the list why didn\u2019t you ask if it could be? Or if you could bring some? \n- Someone else can bring wine? \n- Turkey mashed potatoes and a side dish sounds like a full meal to me? \n- It\u2019s their first time hosting and you\u2019re nitpicking everything they do wrong in your eyes, why not give them a chance? \n- Potluck style thanksgiving sounds awesome, and next time may be even better since this one\u2019s the first that they\u2019re hosting", "YTA \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with bring your own dish or BYOB - it\u2019s fun tbh. If you\u2019re going to be such a grinch about it all you should probably sit this one out.", "YTA. I\u2019ve never had corn or mashed potatoes at thanksgiving and I\u2019m American. Different people have different things.

You\u2019re ingrains unbelievably entitled!", "So, re-reading my post as written, I agree, I definitely ATA. He's hosting, he decides what he makes. I like corn and mashed potatoes, but that doesn't mean he has to have them. I like to make everything, he doesn't have to. Work smarter, not harder, I guess? Yes, it won't be the Thanksgiving we're accustomed to, but it will be fine. I'll just make stuffing, my side and bring some juice and wine. We/I will forego mashed potatoes and corn this year and live to tell the tale. I'll have less cooking and cleaning to do. I get to relax and spend time with family. I'm thankful for that family, even though we don't always see or do things the same way. Next year I will be hosting again - it's true that I like it the way I like it. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA. He\u2019s probably doing the best he can considering this is his first time doing so in about 10 years. If you don\u2019t want to bring a side dish, then just don\u2019t bring one. Otherwise you might do better to take you and your brood to Golden corral. There\u2019s always somebody in the mix to take a nice event, and fuss it to death until it\u2019s just not enjoyable", "YTA. \n\nJust because you didn't choose to do a potluck Thanksgiving doesn't mean he has to do the same.

Don\u2019t ruin it for him.", "Damn, you sound insufferable. YTA.", "YTA for expecting everything to be done your way. My experience is that nobody actually wants corn on Thanksgiving, it is filler and people take some out of politeness but don't eat it and it is thrown away. The same with mashed potatoes, just filler that is thrown away. I have never been to a Thanksgiving where anybody was drinking wine, so it is not needed. Juice is okay but as a doctor pointed out it is just a sugar solution with none of the benefits of eating the fruit, so is actually no healthier for you than sugared sodas. Shocker, I know. Just go and relax, there will be plenty of food.", "YTA...I'm hosting for the first time this year I put out a text saying I'm making X,Y,Z...what does everyone else want to bring. Only odd thing was my older son requesting my younger son to make my Mom's potato salad (Mom passed in Dec 2021 and my sons were very close to her so I guess that means we're getting potato salad at every function or we have so far! for example they brought cake and candles for my birthday...and Mom's potato salad LOL!) I realized afterward that nobody was brining a desert so I texted the crew I'm making jewish apple cake and brownies iff anyone wants a pie then buy it or make it and bring it. So pumpkin pie from a local bakery is being brought by my youngest since he has to make \\`5 lbls of potato salad and leaves for disney at 10 tom night!", "My aunt is being corn cake to my house\u2026would that count as corn? I\u2019m not sure, I can\u2019t digest it and avoid. YTA. Get over yourself and maybe give thanks?\n\nEdit: I wish my aunt was \u201cbeing\u201d corn, but she is bringing corn cake.

The thanksgiving host does the turkey and dressing and request everything else. Now, the drink issue that is on the host, especially when they ask for coffee filters, that is a bit to far unless they do not drink coffee.", "You seem pretty hung up on the fact that there isn't wine, rather interesting.  And seriously, just because he's not doing it YOUR way doesn't mean he's doing it the WRONG way.  YTA.", "Some people have no business hosting, honestly.", "YTA. It sounds like he is providing a full meal and lots of beverage choices. They simply are not why you want. Expecting someone else to make your preferred sides and provide your preferred drinks is a bit much.", "YTA but honestly it mostly seems like after hosting for so long you\u2019ve just gotten set in your own way of doing things. The way BIL is hosting is 100% super normal to me. Most of our big family holiday dinners are pot luck style to an extent. Honestly I would recommend swapping host duties for holidays more often, alternating between family members. It\u2019ll help you get out of your own way and hopefully help you get more flexible socially. Especially for your kids, please don\u2019t make them as rigid. They should be able to still enjoy a thanksgiving meal without a specific type of potato, or the specific kind of juice they like.", "YTA.  There isn\u2019t a set in stone menu for Thanksgiving.  Or a set in stone procedure for what the host needs to do.  And it\u2019s incredibly rude to attempt to dictate to another how to host.  He\u2019s making two turkeys and 4 sides?  How is that not the majority of the meal?  BTW\u2026corn and mashed potatoes are a want, not a need.  Many Thanksgiving meals do not include those specific sides.  Ours doesn\u2019t\u2026never has.   Pot-luck style Thanksgivings are quite common.  \n\nHe\u2019s given the heads up that they\u2019re not providing wine (their choice\u2026maybe they don\u2019t drink much, maybe they don\u2019t want to spend a bunch of money on wine).  Apparently, they don\u2019t drink much coffee, so gave a heads up for those of you who do.  \n\nOne of the trade offs of not hosting is that you may not get the meal *you* want.  You\u2019ve chosen, in the past, to cook what is your ideal Thanksgiving meal.  But that\u2019s your ideal.  Here\u2019s the trade off\u2026you don\u2019t get to tell the host what to serve.  You don\u2019t get both the convenience of not having to host and a meal catered to your expectations.", "NTA.   But.... everyone does things differently. \n\nBe happy you don't have to do everything.\n\nI'm bringing Pecan pie, pecan bars, apple pie, ice cream and whipped cream.

Yes he is disorganized and said people can bring sides.  You want other sides (personally I think kids would prefer twice baked potatoes as much as mashed).  Just go with the flow.  Everyone is a different host.  And best of all, you have the year off from hosting!", "Your brother is the asshole. What kind of monster doesn\u2019t make the gravy from the turkey drippings", "Nta....he wants the credit but not the work", "This is a learning moment. Go back to hosting at your house. I've only ever hosted Thanksgiving once but I made sure to have all the regular dishes. Thanksgiving is pretty generic really. Most people expect certain things. I would never have asked my guests to bring anything other than something they specifically wanted (such as drinks) I even made special gluten-free dishes. NTA but skip BIL's turkey days from now on.", "NTA. BIL wanted to host Thanksgiving but didn\u2019t want to do any of the work, instead he outsourced the labor to all the women in the family. I say from now on you do the same thing, make the main dish and ask everyone else to bring dishes potluck style.", "My BIL considers himself a fabulous cook, so I guess I was expecting he'd cook, including the sides. I could have offered to bring corn, but I was already offering to bring stuffing and another side, and there would be 4 other vegetable dishes (if anyone volunteered to make them). I was looking forward to just being a guest - I didn't expect having to bring multiple sides. If they said upfront that \"hosting\" meant providing the location and turkey and everything else would be potluck, then no problem, I get it. I could set my expectations accordingly.  But they said they wanted to \"host\", and I was okay with that because I was thinking I could bring a pie, maybe some wine and relax - no need to cook this year. So, yes, maybe IATA and my expectations are too high (I thought mashed potatoes was a given!), but we go out of our way when hosting every year to make it nice and enjoyable for everyone and provide the complete dinner - guests just need to show up. I guess I was expecting a similar experience. And, no, they are not a young couple hosting people for the first time - they are in their 50s and host parties frequently.", "I'm gonna get downvoted for this but here goes:\n\nNTA.  \n\nWhere I come from 'hosting' means you're providing the staples, as well as the space, UNLESS you state otherwise UPFRONT.  To me, BIL didn't say this was him hosting AND it being potluck, which to me is exactly what it turned out to be.  As another commenter pointed out he wanted the glory but to not expend the effort for it.\n\nFor the record, staples in this area are:  turkey, gravy, a veg of some sort, usually a potato dish(whipped/mashed/baked/scalloped) and a simple desert(read ice cream/store bought pie).  Drinks vary on what the household normally has.  I hate coffee so you're going to be SOOL here unless you bring your own thermos of it or something.\n\nDownvote away.", "NTA.

What I didn't mention is that this BIL always criticizes and makes nitpicky comments about everything, not just to me, but everyone - how he'd do [fill in the blank] better; how the turkey was too dry, the potatoes too lumpy, etc.; when visiting my home he's told me my kitchen and furniture is subpar in various ways; he complained about getting socks for a gift (not from me) when he asked for socks, because they were the \"wrong\" socks, even though he didn't specify the \"right\" socks, etc. He fancies himself a great cook with sophisticated taste, and asked to host, so I was expecting he'd be showcasing his so-much-better-than-mine cooking skills. He's not doing that, though, and that's fine. Honestly, I don't care what he does or doesn't cook, and I'm happy to bring things I know my family likes and will eat - I just wish he'd stop acting like/saying he's so much better at everything/than everyone.

We are all compromising this year.", "I read it as the 4 vegetable dishes had not been claimed yet so they may not be made at all, not that BIL was making them by default, but either way your point is still valid and I agree with you", "It looks like he is making two turkeys, cranberry sauce, and twice baked potatoes. It says that the 4 veggie sides have not been claimed or volunteered. Not that potluck style isn\u2019t a valid way to host an event, but to say he\u2019s providing a full balanced meal is a stretch.", "What I didn't write because there's not enough space is that my BIL is critical of everything - he always comments on how he'd do this or that differently/better, or how when he's here he points out things that he thinks are subpar in my house - the kitchen, the furniture, etc.. He complained about the socks someone gave him for Christmas, after he asked for socks. He doesn't just do this to me, he does it to everyone. When we host, guests are more than welcome to bring whatever or whoever they want, and everyone always has a good time.  It is a very easy going experience for all (in large part because we make it that way). So, yes, I can see why folks think IATA if they think it's simply because he's hosting differently - that's not the issue. It's more due to BIL's \"I can do it better\" attitude - I guess if him \"doing it better\" is making everyone else do it, then I guess he's right.", ">Is iced tea not juice anymore?\n\nSince when has iced tea ever been a juice? \n\nI Googled it for you:\n\n\"Is iced tea juice? Technically, no. Iced tea is made by steeping tea leaves in water, then adding ice. Juice is made by extracting the liquid from fruits or vegetables.\"", "Agreed with everything except, no type of tea has ever been juice.", "Ice tea is not juice.", "Agree, I have no issue with potluck/BYOB. What I didn't mention is that this BIL always criticizes and makes nitpicky comments about everything - how he'd do it better, when visiting my house he's told me my kitchen and furniture is subpar in various ways, he's complained about getting socks for a gift (not from me) when he asked for socks, because they were the \"wrong\" socks, even though he didn't specify the \"right\" socks, etc. He fancies himself a great cook with sophisticated taste, and asks to host, so I was expecting he'd be showcasing his so-much-better-than-mine cooking skills. He's not doing that, though, and that's fine. Honestly, I don't care what he does or doesn't cook, and am happy to bring things I know my family likes - I just wish he'd stop acting like he's so much better at everything/than everyone. Of course, his homemade cranberry sauce *will* be more sophisticated than the canned cranberry I have, which I specifically buy for my 94-yr-old grandmother who loves it, can't chew well, and won't eat the non-canned kind.

You may have expected one thing, but judging him for not living up to your unshared expectations does not make him an asshole.\n\nPlus, baked potatoes and mashed potatoes are pretty interchangeable in my mind. Mix the mashed potatoes with a couple fixins, add it back to the skin, and it's basically the same thing but nicer. If you want corn, bring corn. \"Hosting Thanksgiving\" doesn't automatically mean providing corn, and it's crazy to me that this is your line in the sand. \n\nEvery family/friend Thanksgiving I've been to since becoming an adult has involved guests bringing dishes to share.
