We are animal lovers, and we don\u2019t mind it hanging out around the house, but don\u2019t want a cat coming inside. So we used a spray bottle and water to deter it a few times, and it stopped coming to the door.\n\n About a week later, we noticed the cat hasn\u2019t come around. I saw a picture of a similar cat on our local community Facebook group, screen shotted it, and sent it to my neighbour to see if it was hers (in hindsight I should have just not said anything but I am an animal lover and the little girl next door was sad about her cat and I remember how I felt when my cat went missing, and I eventually found it because of a picture in a group). I said hey is this yours? I noticed he hasn\u2019t been around the last few weeks! \n\nShe popped off on me about how she doesn\u2019t appreciate the cat being sprayed and how it probably is gone because of us spraying it. I let her know we have no intentions of harming an animal; and let her know that spray bottles are a common deterrent for cats and that we cannot by any means have cat hair in our home as we are all allergic. \n\nThen she proceeded to tell me that her husband (who is currently in prison and getting out in a month\u2026) is LIVID and sent angry emojis. I once again assured her that we enjoy the cat, just not in the home, and did not intend to cause harm.\n\nNow I\u2019m anxious because this dude is going to get out of prison in October and is slightly schizophrenic and has this idea in his head that we are the reason their 18 YEAR OLD CAT is gone. Apparently that was his comfort cat cause he had cats in prison. I\u2019m sure it hid and died because it\u2019s 18.\n\nAm I the asshole???\n\n\nEDIT TO ADD: the cat entered our home many times before resulting to spraying it to deter it. I would never spray a cat just for lingering around the house. I actually enjoyed it hanging out outside with us.
