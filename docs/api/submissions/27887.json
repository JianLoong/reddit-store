I saw a picture of a similar cat on our local community Facebook group, screen shotted it, and sent it to my neighbour to see if it was hers (in hindsight I should have just not said anything but I am an animal lover and the little girl next door was sad about her cat and I remember how I felt when my cat went missing, and I eventually found it because of a picture in a group).

Apparently that was his comfort cat cause he had cats in prison. I\u2019m sure it hid and died because it\u2019s 18.\n\nAm I the asshole???\n\n\nEDIT TO ADD: the cat entered our home many times before resulting to spraying it to deter it.

It's been scientifically proven repeatedly. However, for aoap, this isn't their cat. And it's mot going to harm or damage the human/animal bond between them because there is no bond. And having the cat fearful of coming into their house IS the goal. There are other things OP can do. There are deterrent sprays that could spray the porch/yard.
