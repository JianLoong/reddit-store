Its too sly and quick for humans, which leads me to my next point; how is she catching these Rabbits? If they're easy to catch then they most certainly must be ill. Nature should be allowed to take its course in these cases, no matter how sorry we feel for it. Theres a life cycle in nature for a reason, one rabbit dead is another animals dinner, its just the way things are.

I have two of those fuckers and they try to hide it if something is wrong with them. You really have to know them to be able to catch it early if they have stasis or something like that. We almost lost our girl on two occasions. The boy's teeth don't always grow straight and he has to go to the vet every 4-5 weeks to abrade his teeth. If we wouldn't do it, he would immediately stop eating and get diarrhea. Bunnies constantly have to eat or they die. \n\nWe had our late bunny only for about six months. He constantly had stomach issues and in those six months before he died we spent a nice vacation moneywise on him at the vet. Overnight stays at clinics included. We're childfree anyways but I always joke that we can't afford children because we have bunnies. \n\nI love them to death and hope they'll stay around as long as possible but oh my god it's a constant effort to keep them alive.
