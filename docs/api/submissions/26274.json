I wouldn't let my 5-6 year old play against 10 year olds either. Too much risk of them getting hurt.

Not even say the kids would do it on purpose, but they are going to be excited to play and not even thinking about how much smaller the other kids are.", "NTA, 5 year olds should not be playing field sports against 8-10 year olds. There's no scenario where that is beneficial for anyone involved.\n\nThe young kids will get hurt or demoralised, and the older kids will  not have a challenging game and won't learn or improve.  \n\n\nIf there is enough for one full team of 11, play 5 a side instead.", "NTA. First of all, because it's dangerous. He is not ready to fight off kids twice his age. \nBut also, does your wife really think the other kids will give him the ball? He will be running up and down the field the whole game and try his little heart out but the other kids want to win. They will see him as dead weight. At best they will just ignore him. \n\nFrom personal experience: my parents forced me to play out seasons or stay in an activity for the whole year even if I disliked it. It only caused me not wanting to try anything because I was afraid to get stuck for another year. He is too young to understand a commitment for a while season. He should just try a lot of things and hopefully he finds his passion. If he likes soccer, let him go to another team.", "NTA.  There's a difference between encouraging him to keep trying if it's too hard/difficult (ie: push a little to grow) and allowing him to quit because there's a real chance of real injury.  There's a reason leagues are split up by age.  So that (generally) the kids are around about the same physical size and ability.  There's a big difference between an average10yo and an average 6yo in strength, size, dexterity and just understanding the rules of the game.

I started when I was five. He\u2019s already starting to equate it with bad experiences and that will do nothing for him in the future if you want him to keep playing. I\u2019d suggest finding a different league where he\u2019ll be playing against kids his own age/size, or find a different sport. Baseball is pretty forgiving at this age.", "NTA- I\u2019m usually of the mindset that once you start you see the season through but this seems ridiculously dangerous to put 4/5 year olds against kids that are 8/9/10.  At that age difference, someone is gonna get hurt and it won\u2019t be pretty", "NTA.  There is a safety reason for many team sports having either age or weight ranges.", "NTA - As a current soccer coach of 10-11YOs, there's no way a kid as young as yours should be playing at their level. Just asking for a bad accident and the older kids would most likely relish the idea of drilling a younger kid to look cool.", "NTA \n\nThis is dangerously irresponsible on the part of the organizers and is going to get kids hurt.\n\nIf there aren\u2019t enough kids then they have to downgrade to 5-a-side half-field play, merge with another organization, or just end it because the interest isn\u2019t there.", "I\u2019m glad i left soccer now.", "I think you are right specially with a difference in age that big. I will play with him and if he likes it I will enroll him on a team later on. I am a soccer fan so my view might be a little bit towards keep him playing soccer.", "That\u2019s beyond insane. Some kid is going to get hurt. I worked in volunteer soccer leagues (AYSO) they would never allow this. Kids safety should be number 1.", "NTA - that snot fair on any of the kids. Even if you can get the kids in your club to play nice, thats not going to be the case against all the other teams.\n\nIve coached for years and its hard enough in single team clubs to handle training for players who are genuinely good players from those first year kids with not that much natural ability to ensure they all get the most out of things, and thats when they are all the same age and can relate socially. handling kids double the age and size would hold everyone back and not be safe.", "They are a member of the state soccer association. I looked at the regs when this was announced and from what I can see, the kids are allowed to play up one level after they\u2019ve played a full season at their level.  This means that the U8 kids could play up to U10 but not the little ones", "Losing to other kids is developmentally appropriate.  Getting hurt playing physical sports with kids far larger is dangerous and NOT developmentally appropriate.  \n\nThis can\u2019t be AYSO or any similar national or even large organization.  This has to be some podunk org that doesn\u2019t care.  Please take your kid out of this.  If it\u2019s a real organization, please report this nonsense to regional or national leadership ASAP.  Everyone I have met in these big sports orgs cares about kids and wouldn\u2019t participate in this kind of garbage.\n\nNTA", "If your kid likes it then you need to get him into that other league that will be 1hr round trip. Half an hour each way is really not that inconvenient. I've been known to drive an hour through LA rush hour traffic for pickup games. \n\nSoccer is such a great sport to get into because it's so easy to keep playing into adulthood. I'm not that good because I didn't play in high school or college, but as an adult I play tons of pickup soccer. And having a hobby in your 20s that does not revolve around drinking is absolutely amazing for mental health. \n\nNTA about this league, but I think you will be TA if you don't get him into the league a little farther away.", "Definitely report the club then. The association will take care of it because it puts them at huge liability risk. If they don\u2019t, go up the ladder to UYSA themselves. They take stuff like this incredibly seriously.", "It is a small county, but they\u2019re a member of the state soccer association. There\u2019s regs, training, safety standards, qualified refs, etc.  I don\u2019t know how this could possibly be allowed to happen.", "I hear you but if we do that, they\u2019re going to know it was us. It\u2019s our kid who got hurt 10 minutes into his first practice and didn\u2019t go back. I don\u2019t want to be treated badly if we keep doing soccer..  are the refs going to allow this?", "Any referee should notice that the ages don\u2019t work. You can also bring up your concerns with your state referee committee. They can make their refs aware and advise them to put the information in their postgame report, making it easier to penalize the club. You should be able to find their information pretty easily. And honestly? If you report the club for unsafe procedures, you may have to change clubs. But why would you ever want to be associated with a club that shows zero regard for the safety of the kids in their care? \n\nIt\u2019s definitely something to weigh out. But clubs like that just ruin the game for everyone and deserve to be suspended if not entirely disbanded."]}
