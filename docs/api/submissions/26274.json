Why is your wife okay with your baby playing a sport with children twice his age?", "NTA. maybe if your wife got hit by a soccer ball by someone twice her size, she'd get some sense knocked into her. Always think about your kid's well being.", "NTA If you make him, he may learn to hate soccer, sports, and *you*.\n\nHe can try again later when he is bigger, stronger, and mentally more capable of understanding. \n\nYour wife needs to get a grip. Good for you for standing up for your kid. There are other physical activities your kid can do, surely. At his age, they are a bundle of energy, even by themselves at a playground.

The younger kids won't have fun at all, they'll just be \"schooled\" by the older kids all the time.  The older ones won't have the skills to keep from hurting the younger ones, either.  \n\nAs a side matter, both my kids played soccer twice a year (fall, spring) and never once did a coach hurt them at all.  I'd consider removing my kid just from the bad coaching!", "NTA. A five year old should not be on a team with 10 year olds. That is a massive age difference when it comes to that age group. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve never been a fan of the \u201cif you join a team you owe it to the team to play the whole season\u201d mindset.", "That's dumb. 5 year olds are only just figuring out how to use their bodies in an athletic way, they don't understand the rules, you put them out there and just let them kick and have a good time.\n\n10 year olds are getting to the point where they understand most of the rules, understand the team dynamic, and are significantly larger, stronger, and with much better control of their bodies.  \nThere is a reason we separate youth sports by age ranges, and it's to avoid this very thing. I wouldn't let my 5-6 year old play against 10 year olds either. Too much risk of them getting hurt. Which, incidentally, will surely kill any love they might have developed for the game.", "Haha sounds like someone is concerned about keeping up appearances and it ain't you and the kids! NTA", "NTA, those kids will be twice his age and twice his size. It\u2019s ridiculous it\u2019s even allowed. And given that the adult coaches can\u2019t even adjust their playing styles to match his, I wouldn\u2019t expect a child to. Not even say the kids would do it on purpose, but they are going to be excited to play and not even thinking about how much smaller the other kids are.", "NTA, 5 year olds should not be playing field sports against 8-10 year olds. There's no scenario where that is beneficial for anyone involved.\n\nThe young kids will get hurt or demoralised, and the older kids will  not have a challenging game and won't learn or improve.  \n\n\nIf there is enough for one full team of 11, play 5 a side instead.", "NTA. First of all, because it's dangerous. He is not ready to fight off kids twice his age. \nBut also, does your wife really think the other kids will give him the ball? He will be running up and down the field the whole game and try his little heart out but the other kids want to win. They will see him as dead weight. At best they will just ignore him. \n\nFrom personal experience: my parents forced me to play out seasons or stay in an activity for the whole year even if I disliked it. It only caused me not wanting to try anything because I was afraid to get stuck for another year. He is too young to understand a commitment for a while season. He should just try a lot of things and hopefully he finds his passion. If he likes soccer, let him go to another team.", "NTA.  There's a difference between encouraging him to keep trying if it's too hard/difficult (ie: push a little to grow) and allowing him to quit because there's a real chance of real injury.  There's a reason leagues are split up by age.  So that (generally) the kids are around about the same physical size and ability.  There's a big difference between an average10yo and an average 6yo in strength, size, dexterity and just understanding the rules of the game.  Now if one is bigger than average and the other smaller than average, that's a recipe for disaster.", "NTA!\ud83e\udd1d\ud83c\udffd", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
