His brother \"Jimmy\" is 30m.\n\nIn November I went out for dinner with an old friend and colleague of mine, who is male. Max was fully aware where I was and who I was with, and encouraged me to go have a nice night, since we have a toddler and I rarely get to go out. So my friend and I went to a local pub for dinner. I didn't realise while I was there that Jimmy was also there. Bizarrely, instead of coming up to say hi to me, Jimmy assumed I was on a date, and took photos of me sitting with my friend which he then sent to Max suggesting I was cheating. Max shut him down and said, \"that's her colleague\", but Jimmy didn't drop it. The next week they were out in a group, Jimmy got drunk and started telling everyone that \"Max's missus is cheating on him\".\n\nMax disclosed that to me and I was so angry. Like, wtf goes through Jimmy's mind that he sees a woman out on public *not with her owner* and assumes she's cheating, and not only that but publicly accuses her? So fucked up, right? I say to Max, Jimmy can apologise to us both or he's not welcome around here. Max says he told Jimmy to apologise, but he won't, and he can't make him do it, so it's out of his hands.\n\nCouple weeks later, we are at a family gathering and Jimmy strolls up and starts making small talk with me. I told him firmly (not in earshot of others) that I knew what he did and I wasn't going to make small talk with him now or on any occasion until he wants to apologise for telling half the pub I'm a cheater. He literally pretended he didn't know what I'm talking about and we haven't spoken since. I came across him the other day and we avoided each other.\n\nI am fully aware Max cannot force an apology from Jimmy. He agrees I shouldn't have to pretend it's okay, but he's also kind of acting like I'm making too big a deal of this. I think if anything, he's not making a big enough deal of it and isn't standing up for me as much as he should, because he and Jimmy are right back to normal and acting Luke he didn't creepily \u274c\ufe0f surveil \u274c\ufe0f photograph, and \u274c\ufe0f falsely accuse me of cheating on the sole basis I had dinner with a male friend.
