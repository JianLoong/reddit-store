Your sister is choosing to have the baby, so she needs to deal with the consequences. \n\nUnfortunately, if that means she cannot support herself and the baby, she needs to consider other ways in which she can help give the baby a good life, like maybe an open adoption?\n\nOf course, if you were to say something like that straight out, she would be right to call you an AH.  But if you do not send her money and then she asks, \"What am I supposed to do now?\" Then... you could tactfully suggest something like that.\n\nWhatever you do, if you keep sending money she will probably guilt you into continuing to send money for the rest of that kid's life.\n\nYou're in a terrible situation, no doubt about that.

Cut them off because you\u2019re not responsible for paying for their lack of better judgment. \n\nYour sister could also consider a private adoption that may help cover the expenses and more if she comes to her senses and realize she\u2019s not in a position to raise a child in poverty.

I have four brothers/brother-in-laws. I'm financially better off than all of them. If I was in a situation where I could help pay for their kids medical expenses when they were financially strapped without sacrificing much to my own well-being, I think the ethically correct thing is to try to help as much as you can. Also, prenatal care is SO important.  But also I would be making sure they're taking steps to become more financially stable and have a plan to pay me back. And if they fail at becoming financially stable for too long then I would call CPS. I also would not just give them money, but I would pay their bills directly."]}
