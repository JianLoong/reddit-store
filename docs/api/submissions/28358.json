Period.\n\nThe whole idea here is that she won't pay the parents back and then he won't demand the money from the parents. And the parents and she know this. This is abusive behaviour.", "I\u2019m neither attacking nor discrediting your personal beliefs, I\u2019m simply saying abortions happen and that people drop their kids off at fire station steps. Nor am I calling you a hypocrite.", "You have access to those things where you are, and that's great. Your experience is not universal.", "What state? I'm in WA and know there are many resources here, but Missouri, for instance, makes it a lot more difficult.", "lol. how much money do toy think they make?", "No Im pro choice actually, but I also think abortion is unethical. \n\nI'm libertarian on it", "This will shock you, but not everyone lives in a black and white world with only two teams and it's somehow unthinkable to not be on one of those teams.", "Sure that's the ideal but that's not what happened..\n\n>And you think involving CPS if (when) they screw up is a smart back up?

In a situation where finances are the problem, they would just try to set them up with resources.", "[removed]", "And yet the penalty for killing an unborn child without the parents' permission is the same as murder.\n\nSo it's murder sometimes.\n\nAbortion is not 'better' than asking for money. Don't be stupid.\n\nHaving your parents emotionally extort your brother for money for *any reason at all* is wrong. It doesn't make any difference what the motive is.\n\nSuggesting that people should get abortions because they are poor, now that is pretty damned evil.", "I never said you were doing those things?\n\nI was simply bemused by your statement as a means for justification.", "I was replying to someone who mentioned the USA, sorry my comment didn't specifically mention that.

So for America it's available, that's why I replied to the person who stated America in their comment.", "Most my family is in Utah, that's where I first got my free birth control. Now I'm in Michigan that's where I got my free IUD. Both a red and blue state, and Utah is one of the more red states I mean parents have like 7 kids each and it's incredibly frowned upon to not want kids there.

There are at least 4 states that have made it very difficult to get affordable birth control. \n\nThere are still towns in the US that don't have high speed internet and y'all are acting like everything here is so easy and why don't people just not have kids when they are already in poverty.", "I\u2019m in a red state.  Can confirm.  Not hard to get BC.  Condoms\u2026even latex free. Clinic contraception or pills.", "I love that! Birth control should be affordable and accessible and GA seems to be doing it right.", "My whole family is trailer trash, very few people that have money in it. We all accommodate for shit, like sorry it sucks to be responsible but those that aren't have kids those that are don't.", "Again it's available, you might have to go out of your way a little to get it. The most effective way of not getting pregnant is not having sex and if you can't go out of the way to get bc why are you going out of your way to have sex. If you do end up having kids that's a bit more of a responsibility than taking the time to go get bc. Don't have sex, make a trip for some bc, or face whatever consequences happen. I'm poor as hell and had to drive 4 hours for birth control but It was worth it.", "No. WTAF are they keeping the kid.

Do not send any more money.", "NTA. How do they think they are going to pay for a child if they can't afford pregnancy costs. Why do so many people do this. It's literally crazy to me. You can wait, build up some savings and not always be in debt and struggling or have a baby early, put yourself in debt, constantly be stressed about how to afford nappies, babyfood, normal food, clothes, rent, etc. Which scenario is better to raise a child in and better for you?", "NTA... STOP sending money.  You are preventing them from the personal growth that is a requirement of raising children.  You are HANDICAPPING them. \n\nJust say NO. \"If you want to be parents you will need to be able to provide. If you cant do that now, it is better to look at other options.\"", "How come there are so many people asking for money from their children or siblings though they make very questionable life choices that take them into a tight spot money-wise? They are responsible for themselves.", "No the Ahole.  Advise them to give the child up for adoption.", "NTA - Time for sis and her baby-daddy to line up at the welfare office.  This is the life THEY chose, you didn't. \n\nRefuse the extra money and make it clear, no extra money is coming, EVER.  Not for diapers, formula, or other disposables.  You can gift them a crib or a car seat as a one-time thing.  \n\nThey need to learn to make it work before the baby arrives.", "YTA, it's time stop being the family bank.", "NTA \n\nYour parents are the AH for asking you foe money that will go to your sister. Your sister is the bigger AH for bringing life into the world knowing damn well she cant afford to raise the child and then asking your parents for financial help knowing the money will come from you. Whoever asked for more is a complete AH for having the audacity of asking for more when u already did more than u need to. Go NC with them and let them struggle", "When you\u2019re a grown-up you make your own choices. She made her choice so tough shit. It\u2019s not your responsibility to pay for your sister. And don\u2019t let anybody guilt you into that.", "Boundaries are hard, and people that have none will make you feel guilty for yours. If you dont stop it here, it won't stop. It's not your responsibility to pay for her life choices. She wants to keep it she needs to figure it out. Having you finance the pregnancy and the cost of raising the kid isn't figuring it out, and that's exactly where this ends if you dont stop it now.", "NTA. You\u2019re not the one who got her pregnant so why should you be responsible? And if she\u2019s that bad off financially, assuming that you\u2019re in America, she can get Medicaid.", "NTA. If she's grown and mature enough to have a baby, she's grown and mature enough to provide for it herself. Do not send her a single cent. Don't send your parents any money that might get sent to her. If she can't take care of a kid, that's her problem for deciding to have one. You are not responsible for her reproductive choices or financial choices.

Babies are a never ending expense with daycare, diapers, equipment, medical appointments, etc.  This will never end.", "YTA to yourself bc you clearly don\u2019t know how to establish boundaries and stick to them without letting people manipulate you to get what they want.

Stop it now while you still can. If they want to be parent's they'll have to provide for their kid(s) themselves.", "No! Stand your ground. They will always expect you to be an ATM  if you don\u2019t.", "NTA!  If they can't afford to procreate, no one else should have to foot the bill, period.  Your family are the AHs for even asking.", "NTA Tell her to apply for assistance. She should be able to get WIC, SNAP, and possibly Medicaid or cheap health insurance to address most of these expenses.", "Well and I would make sure sis isn\u2019t double dipping. Getting money from u/ju29ro- AND their parents. That is what my sibling did to me. Complained to our parents how much my wedding was costing them and to me, so we both paid for the same bill. Siblings (like all people) can be manipulative little shits!", "If they are in a red state, they need to go directly the loudest church in the city and beg them for assistance and test that church's commitment to community support.  Literally camp on the steps.", "I was stunned when a friend told me the other day that her daughter had been recommended the pull out method by a doctor!  And we are in Australia with none of the red state nonsense.", "I'm in a very red part of texas. you can still readily get birth control just about anywhere.", "Or wait, hear me out- spend that time working and not being a drain on society.", "Missouri is just fine about getting low cost or free birth control pretty much anywhere in the state.  Shockingly they even have Planned Parenthood's.  \nNo abortions, but birth control, STD testing, and healthcare.

I live in a rural location with no options that I know of. None.", "Rocco Lampone has entered the chat!", "Condoms are still cheaper than a whole baby to raise and pay for.", "Exactly why I said if you want it you may have to travel. Each state has something, might not be at your doorstep. Again I had to travel four hours for mine in the state I'm in. If you can't accommodate for going to get bc you can't accommodate for having a kid either.", "Nowhere in America is there birth control clinics left and right. I'm just saying simply, if you don't want to get pregnant don't have sex, or travel to get bc, cause it's available somewhere in each state.", "Found the Republican.", "I don't disagree with you, but the lack of availability within smaller communities is a problem, one that is compounded by attitudes in smaller communities that aren't very egalitarian or, I suppose in modern parlance, woke.", "Cause everythings about politics? I'm neither party. I'm a pansexual goth girl who could care less about politics, I just have a posable thumbs, grew up poor, and know exactly how easy you can get stuff in America if you have a working brain.", "Lots of things arent available at people's doorsteps either. That's how the world is and will always be. Again my point is if you want birth control there's free methods and/or in each state, choice is yours what to do and how much you want to risk for sex. I'm not able to fix this all Ik is that even when I was homeless I was able to get bc. Both times I've gotten bc it's been free, I had to accommodate, as will most people. Especially if you live in a rural area or far away, expecting there to be clinics in everybody's location is kinda a lost hope dream to have."]}
