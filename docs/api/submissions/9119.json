Had he offered a solution, even if it were to say, \"Well, what I can't contribute monetarily I will do by taking on all housecleaning/handling the gardening/whatever so that the upkeep of the house is ensured and our investment is safe,\" that would be different than trying to guilt you and making it a question of fairness.

I don't think a partnership needs to be 50/50 but he needs to make an effort. He's the one making it about money. If he contributed less financially but was making more of an effort on other things (like cooking or household maintenance) it might be more of a balance. You mention he quit a fulltime job and is now working 2 part time ones? Did he discuss quitting his job beforehand or did he do it thinking you can cover his new direction and  Is that because he lacks job skills or lacks ambition?You need to continue the discussion on responsibility.

I'm failing to see this. Girl, why are you letting this man live in your home when he doesn't even pay? Have some self respect and dump this waste.\nNta but you will be to yourself if you stay with him.", "NTA. He\u2019s a bum. Run.", "NTA\n\nHe wants you to transfer a good chunk of your assets into his name, and puts you down when you don\u2019t want to.\n\nThis guy is wrapped in red flags.", "NTA\n\nDon't ever sell your house for anyone. \nHe's not good for you because he takes advantage of you:\n\n- He quit his full time job for 2 part times which i presume are less paying jobs + less time.\n\n- He drives your car (if he doesn't have a car then he should buy himself one) \n\n- He pays now and then toward the household expenses\n\n- He is choosing to heat some frozen food and says your food is better. \n\nHe is a live-in sponge, as i remember Judge Judy once said. \n\nHe just took control of your house, money, car. \n\nI see you already see all these things, but you need a push to enforce what you want. \n\nHe's not good for you. He isn't ready to build a life with you, but he's ready to quit his job to be a Stay At Home Boyfriend, whithout the cleaning, cooking, loving part.", "Been there, done that, will never do that again. NTA. He's got a good thing going here, and when you dare to question him, he manipulates/guilt trips you. He ain't worth it, honey, and you're worth WAY MORE than just being someone's convenient meal/sex ticket.", "It's easy to be a free spirit when you force others to pay for you.", "There isn't anything more than this right here!   \nYell it from the rooftops!!", "Yes, listen to this, OP.\n\nWhen people accuse you of \"only caring about money\" it's usually because they don't have enough and they want yours.", "You\u2019re not being cynical, just realistic.", "The homemade food is an issue.   I was out if work for awhile contributed little to household bills.   But I shifted to taking on much more of household tasks.  \n\nIf boyfriend isn't willing to work full time, op should not be putting in more effort in household duties.", "I was about to say the same thing. It's easy not to care about money when you just use someone else's.", "Also, he says you know that he will \"help out\".\na) Actually you know he won't, because he doesn't now, either financially or in effort \nb) \"help out\" = he sees financial responsibility as yours and anything from him as \"helping\" you rather than a shared responsibility\nFinancial incompatibility like this doesn't bode well. I'd say go traveling solo, rent out your condo while you're away (NOT TO HIM) and use that time and distraction to think about what an equal partnership looks like", "You need the same article as the other poster here today...\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/parenting/women-gender-gap-domestic-work.html\n\nAnd your hobosexual doesn't even contribute equally financially. \n\nWhat are you doing? \n\nNEVER buy a property with someone that you are not married to, and isn't 100% your equal. And never let a guy mooch off of you like this ever again.", "First of all, dump him and find you an actual adult who pays his own way.\n\nSecond, if you're foolish enough to proceed in this relationship, just know that you will be getting divorced when you finally decide you're done trying to swim through life with a boat anchor tied to your foot.  A marriage isn't just love, sex, and companionship; it's also a financial partnership.\n\nThird, if you're really foolish enough not to dump him, **get a prenup**.  Completely separate your finances.  Otherwise, when you finally get tired of this and divorce him, you'll end up paying for him to play xbox and pretend to work.  Oh, and you'll also get another mortgage to buy the house you paid for back from him.\n\nHonestly, just tell him now that's what will be happening: no large purchases without a contract that specifies you own the asset as a percentage of cash in, and you will get a full financial separate prenup.  His reaction will be enlightening.\n\nAnd on the off chance you chose your username, I'm guessing you're latina.  There are some real cultural things you may have to overcome, but don't let this person ruin your financial life.\n\n> I've tried to explain to him but he says all I care about is money and that I'm putting him down\n\nThis is a *giant* red flag.  You know who only cares about money?  People who like living indoors, eating, having healthcare, and enjoying their life.  You know who doesn't care about money?  Children whose parents provide for them.", "It seems that you\u2019d like to *think* that he\u2019s a good partner, but you can\u2019t justify that, even to yourself. Hence the confusion.", "Heck, he won\u2019t even learn to cook some dishes OP likes.", "Nothing. But he\u2019s happy to ask OP to sell her condo and buy a home with both of them as owners. Hell no. First, he has to show how he\u2019s contributing to the couple in meaningful, concrete ways. He hasn\u2019t done that in years. That\u2019s why I believe he\u2019s using her.", "Or dishes HE likes cuz she does it better!", "Smells like weaponized incompetence"]}
