Had he offered a solution, even if it were to say, \"Well, what I can't contribute monetarily I will do by taking on all housecleaning/handling the gardening/whatever so that the upkeep of the house is ensured and our investment is safe,\" that would be different than trying to guilt you and making it a question of fairness.

I don't think a partnership needs to be 50/50 but he needs to make an effort. He's the one making it about money. If he contributed less financially but was making more of an effort on other things (like cooking or household maintenance) it might be more of a balance. You mention he quit a fulltime job and is now working 2 part time ones? Did he discuss quitting his job beforehand or did he do it thinking you can cover his new direction and  Is that because he lacks job skills or lacks ambition?You need to continue the discussion on responsibility.
