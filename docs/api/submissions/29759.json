The reason for this is that they chose my dad's second wife over me. I was 6 when I lost my mom and 8 when my dad met Diane. I never liked Diane. Initially it was because I saw her presence as being disrespectful to my mom. I was a kid, a little boy who lost his mom and I was a momma's boy so maybe not too surprising. But Diane showed me early that she did not like mentions of my mom. She never said it to my dad or his family, just to me. She'd say it hurt her feelings that I would talk about mom around her like mom was somehow better than her or that I would rather have my mom back. I told my dad and my extended family and they were like oh don't be silly, Diane loves us and she talks about your mom when we do, this is because you don't like your dad moving on.\n\nOver the following few years dad and Diane got married and had kids together and Diane would tell me how much she hated the fact even dad's family missed mom and spoke about her on occasion. She said we were all supposed to be hers now.\n\nThe more I spoke out the more dad would tell me I was trying to ruin his new happiness and that it was cruel to expect him to stay alone forever. I told him he could do better than Diane and I got a lecture from him and my family saying Diane was amazing and mom would have loved her. I even showed them a video I took of Diane making annoyed and disgusted faces and rolling her eyes when mom was mentioned and I was told she knew I was filming and she was sick of my shit.\n\nMy dad agreed to let me go at 16 because I told him I would not try to get along better with Diane and I wanted no part of his family anymore.\n\nTwo months ago Diane exposed herself to the family and really showed them how she felt about mom. One of my cousins was celebrating her birthday and it was one of the milestone birthdays and mom was mentioned and photos were shown of mom since she was my cousins godmother. Diane went off on how she hated my mom and was glad she was dead and she wishes she could erase her from everyone's memories and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nMy dad and his family (minus his younger kids of course) all came crawling back and sent me messages apologizing. I ignored them until it got so overwhelming that they all got together while dad called my grandparents to talk to me. They apologized again and when I said nothing right away they told me I should accept their apology and talk to them. This is when I told them their apology is meaningless to me. They told me I shouldn't say that, I'm being petty, because they're trying to make amends. My dad said nothing was so bad that they couldn't make up for it and I said it was still meaningless.

Your stepmom was obviously a good liar and good at hiding her true feelings and manipulating people. She managed to keep the truth from everybody, but seemingly not from you, so she doubled down on you, and successfully drove a wedge between you and your family which resulted in you leaving as  soon as possible, which is probably what she wanted - makes her lies easier.\n\nAnd finally, when the truth came out, whether by accident or design, it will have come as a total shock to your family. It's possible she thought that having driven you away she could safely admit the truth with no consequences, or it's possible it was revealed by accident, caught up in a moment of annoyance and emotion that she couldn't hold back. Either way, you need to give your family some credit for coming straight to you to apologise. They could easily have ignored it, pretended they hadn't been conned and carried on, but they're admitting they were wrong and you were right, which is a big step. However, they obviously don't understand the depth of the hurt you feel, so expecting you instantly to forgive and forget is a big ask, especially if stepmom is still part of the family. There's a bond of trust that needs to be rebuilt which takes time, and they need to work out how to do that. Don't forget that to an extent they were victims in this as well.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but, ESH.  It's entirely your choice as to whether you accept their apology or not, or allow them back into your life or not, but at least they have admitted they were wrong and had the strength of character to reach out and apologise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Relationships aren't much different.", "Bro, I can't get over the fact that they said you are being petty for not accepting their half ass apology... Definitely NTA. Maybe in some time you'll want to reconnect with them but no contact is probably the best way to go right now", "NTA. An apology doesn\u2019t negate the cruel way you were treated. Feelings don\u2019t just magically go away with the word sorry. So many people seem to forget that.", "NTA \u2026 they\u2019re not even apologizing for failing you they\u2019re only apologizing because they found out you\u2014a child\u2014weren\u2019t lying and they were wrong. they only want you to accept their apologies to address their own guilt. they all suck and i hope your grandparents have been wonderful.", "NTA", "Nta but congrats on being lonely for the rest of your life?", "i think ESH frankly\n\nWhile i won't condone what she said, i can see Diane's point of view. Imagine constantly being compared with and reminded of your partner's ex in a relationship. Now imagine this is still happening after you're married to and have kids with that person... and this is going on for years and years to the point where you've been together with your husband just as long as he was together with his late wife and it's been the sour grapes in the relationship the entire time. It's one thing to still have pictures and have it be brought up from time to time, but it sounds like it was brought up CONSTANTLY and in really bad ways. It would make anyone uncomfortable. It would create tension in any relationship. It sounds to me like everything hit a breaking point for her and she finally flew off the handle and let her resentment slip in the worst way. She said a lot of awful and unfair shit, and it shows a huge lapse in maturity from her, but i think it's more a case of the position Diane was in, rather than who Diane is as a person.\n\nBoth of my parents have remarried. As a rule, I avoid talking in detail about the other parent when I'm around one of my stepparents, because i can understand that it's uncomfortable to hear. I dont expect they would be disrespectful, but i do imagine it would make them incredibly uncomfortable, and make an ass of me.\n\n  \nSaying your dad threw you out is an insane distortion of the truth. you told him you would make no attempt to get along with his new wife and kids - who are as much his blood as you are, by the way - and forced him to choose between letting you live with your grandparents and divorcing her and he chose the only realistic option you gave him. He didnt pick her over you, he just refused to end his marriage to please you.\n\nThe fact is that you /never/ gave your dad's new family a chance, and if she grew to truly resent your mother, it's because you and your family never let her forget she was the second pick, the second favorite wife. If she told you in private to stop bringing up your mother around her in hurtful ways, it was to set a boundary that you never respected. That's understandable as a kid, but still damaging, but it's ridiculous from your adult family. It's sad that she felt she had to hide her discomfort until it became unmanageable and i think EVERYONE in this situation owes EVERYONE an apology. You aren't obligated to accept it - nobody is - but that's what's owed. You, Diane, your family, everyone should apologize.  \nthat's my opinion.", "YTA", "Did he divorce her? No? What could they possibly offer you?", "NTA.  They don't get to decide if or when you accept their apology.  Just because they now see that you were right doesn't change anything.  They just want to be forgiven for their mistake, but that creates no obligation for you to do so.", "NTA for sure, but if you want some family, then maybe make amends?", "Nta. Sending hugs dear. Its incredibly difficult to lose a parent that young, and even more to deal with this. It would be better though if you donot have contact with dad, and dads family anymore. Diane is an ah, but not the Ah here. Your father and his family is. Diane is the ah for saying all this to a literal kid. And your father and his family didnt give a f about you and what you had to say and just said you were not happy about your dad moving on? Like your dad didnt even care a sec for you. Its not that he didnt understand, its that he didnt care. I hope you find peace of mind dear. And it all works out for you.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being petty. You were 8 years old, suffering as your stepmother disparaged your dead mother, and your father and grandparents neither believed you, nor defended you. You were driven at 16 out of your own home.\n\nAn apology is nice, but it doesn\u2019t fix anything. The elements of an apology are remorse, expressing regret, and making amends. They just want to say sorry and have you joyfully forgive all and make nice, and when you didn\u2019t, instead of understanding, they attacked you. They have learned nothing. You don\u2019t owe them anything, so they need to stop behaving like they are entitled to a word from you.\n\nThe loss of your mother was a mother wound. Your security and safe landing, gone. Your father refusing to believe and defend you was a father wound. \n\nThey need to acknowledge that you suffered for years because they would rather believe you were a liar than that she would hurt you that way. They allowed you to be driven from your home, feeling unwanted, as a teenager. They let years go by with you gone. A simple sorry, with a shrug, and anger at your non compliance, are not amends. \n\nI have no idea if this will get better between you. People so callous as to leave an 8 year old boy to deal with emotional abuse from an adult, all on his own, aren\u2019t typically the type to improve. I guess anything can happen. Why don\u2019t you send them these comments for them to reflect upon?\n\nAs a mother, here is a hug for the little boy you were.", "OP I'm curious as to the how your dad and his family handled Diane's outburst? What is the status of that relationship? Cause apologizing while the culprit is still in the midst is pointless. Anyhow, NTA, they don't realize that you didn't only loose your mom you lost your whole family in a 2 year span and just got worse as the years wore on. They should try not to be so dense and quite frankly condescending about the situation and allow you time and space to decide if you wanted to have a relationship with them. They pushed so you pushed back!", "They can apologize all they want.  But if the person being apologized to is being bullied into accepting the apology, it's not an apology.  It's a performance.\n\nNTA", "They finally agree with you after disbelieving you and trying to bully you into acceptance, and then they admit that they were wrong, want to apologize, and want to bully you into acceptance? If you act as you've always acted, you're going to get what they've always gotten. Idjits.", "NTA They need to read this thread.", "An apology is simply the right thing to do when you've wronged/hurt someone, not a reset button. It doesn't magically erase the hurt feelings. The wronged party is not obligated to accept the apology nor are they obligated to forgive. Also, there is no timeline on hurt feelings.  OP is NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell them you spent years being dismissed and punished my them for telling the truth about a woman who told you she hated your mother, was glad she was dead, and created a toxic home life for you. If they want your forgiveness it\u2019s going to take years of them showing you they care, that the understand how much they hurt you, and that they know what they did was wrong. An apology is not a magic spell that makes everything better, it\u2019s the first step on a long road to reconciliation. If they\u2019re not willing to do that then they aren\u2019t worth it, and they\u2019re being petty not you.", "I'm laughing over nothing is so bad you can't come back from it.  There are LOTS of things you can't come back from, and this ones pretty bad.", "NTA. They apologised over the phone? Good grief. And merely apologising does not obligate one to forgive.", "OP...you are hurt, it is understandable.  You are also young. There will be times when you will behave badly, not thinking it was bad, and then learn otherwise. Hopefully you'll be a big enough man to apologize then and say you were wrong.\n\nYou never have to accept another's apology.  However, I'm not sure just deciding to stay pissed off or disconnected is in your own best interest.  There are so few people who love us and have known us when we are young.\n\nYou will run into others in your life that are underhanded and fool everyone...sometimes you will be the one that is fooled.  Everyone deserves redemption.  Be judicious in condemning others ....\n\nThis sub has some very unhappy people and their attitudes reflect that - petty, unforgiving,punitive, retaliatory ... \"you don't have to\", \"why should you\" \"f--k them\" ... not really that inspirational.\n\nHolding on to this hurt won't serve you in the long run.  Best of luck to you--", "An apology over the phone, accompanied by scolding that he was wrong not to accept it. Don\u2019t forget that part. Oh, the irony.", "LOUDER! Parents should never put their spouse over their kids. Ik some parents say \"Oh the marriage works better blah blah blah\" but it can really hurt the kids.", "They just want to assuage their own guilt. If OP accepts their half-assed apology, they think it means they are still good people who were manipulated and tricked by Diane. This way, they don't have to do any introspection as to why they believed this random woman over their own family.  By denying them forgiveness, OP is not giving them the relief from accountability and refusing to wipe the slate clean from their abuse. They need to do a lot more than demand forgiveness if they want to truly be better people.", "Barring very strong proof to the contrary, you should always believe your children.  Especially when their claim is consistent.  For years. \n\nIt doesn't matter how good of an actress that stepmother was.   The father and his relatives are shit for not believing the kid.", "Precisely, it took 12 years to ruin their relationships, they think a 10 minute phonecall is going to repair that?", "I'm going to assume that you didn't even read my post and are just angry.  Other things happen in life, everything is not black and white.", "If you've never had to deal with a narcissist, I'm happy for you.  It's not a solo thing for a narcissist, they try to work a large group.  The more attention, the better.  Unless you've gone through it, I guess I can't really explain it very well.  \n\nThey apologized to him.  I guess apologies don't mean anything to anyone any more.  People screw up.  That's like saying if he screwed up and/or lied as a child, they should have put him up for adoption.  That sounds ridiculous, right?  \n\nMy uncle was always an asshole to me (and others).  It really bothered me because he was my dad's brothere and my dad was my hero.  He passed away 21 years ago.  I could never understand how two brothers could be so different.  Later in life, I tried to reconnect with him and for six weeks, we got along really well.  Then, at the end of January this year, he passed away from cancer.  I'm really glad that I didn't hold a grudge and got along with him before he died.  \n\nI'm an older person and it disturbs me how people can hate so easily nowadays and never give forgiveness a chance.", "It's pretty galling that they told OP nothing is so bad they can't make up for it. That's just not something the *wrongdoers*  get to decide; that's *entirely*  up to the person that's been wronged.", "I like that interpretation. Can't believe OP that she hated mom, but will believe her that she hated mom. OP is incidental to the whole thing and it's all about her. Their relationship to OP is subordinate to their relationship to or opinion of her.", "This story does not ring true. Why would she allow herself to be on camera talking shit? Why did she snap now?", "NTA - They weren\u2019t there for you when you needed them as a child. Your childhood is gone. There is literally no way they can give you back your childhood. So what use are they to you now? They failed their most sacred job, to look out for you. At this point , now that you\u2019re grown, what do they have to offer you besides useless apologies? If you think *you* could get something out of it, then by all means reconnect. But you certainly don\u2019t owe them a thing.", "The rift is so huge you don't even have a relationship with your half-siblings, evidenced by referring to them as \"my dad's kids\". Leads me to think your dad didn't visit you with the kids minus Diane. \n\nNo one can demand you accept their apology. That's not how it works.  You are the victim in this situation. You decide if you'll accept it or not or if words are not enough. \n\nYour dad alienated you a long time ago.  He refused to believe you even when you showed him proof. \n\nYour dad was more concerned about being married than his own son. \n\nHe's still only thinking of himself. Why else try and bully you into accepting words of an apology. \n\nWonder why he's so insistent that you accept his apology. What is he trying to gain? Is he close to retirement? And his side of the family?\n\nDon't bother holding a grudge. Not worth the effort or your time. \n\nMoved on and live your life. You have your mom's family. They've been there for you. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re right. Their apology was meaningless. For an apology to mean anything the person needs to accept that they were in the wrong and should be happy to receive forgiveness but as soon as they feel entitled to it, it shows they didn\u2019t really deserve it", "Nta. Theyre cowards? They only apologize via phone call and not in person. A real way to make up for it is if your spineless dad divorces your evil stepmom", "NTA. Please cut the whole lot out of your life. They have no desire to make amends. They don\u2019t realise how much they hurt you. If they did, they would keep trying to apologise and would understand your current feelings. But they expected you to accept their apology the very first time, after they negated every feeling you had about this topic for 8 years. Chances are they will never realise. They are just trying to assuage their own ego by not realising how dumb they were regarding Diane.", "NTA You repeatedly warned them about Diabe and they didn't listen.", "NTA\u2026 take your time to forgive them but from personal experience holding onto resentment only destroys us not the other person. Whenever you feel ready try to forgive, you don\u2019t have to forget and pretend to be a big happy family but it will free you from negativity in your life in the long run", "Then they tell him that he's wrong \\*again\\* to not accept their apology on their terms.", "That's a great analogy", "I'm not sure I agree with your assessment of Diane.  \n\nAfter 8 years of not being confronted by OP due to him living with maternal grandparents, and his loyalty to his mother, maybe even 8 years of her name not even mentioned more than 3-4 times a year.... she blows up at the first mention of her?\n\nYeah, this is not normal.", ">There will be times when you will behave badly, not thinking it was bad, and then learn otherwise. \n\nThat was not remotely happening here. They simply didn't believe him. Over and over for years.\n\nAnd SM most definitely \"knew\" she was behaving badly. And did that for years and years. She lied to her husband and family that *OP* was a liar, mocked him, said awful things about his *dead mother* to the point where he moved out 2 years early.\n\nThis wasn't an oopsie! This wasn't making a mistake, realizing it and then learning. \n\nSM sure didn't learn. She got *worse.* More hateful. Family sure didn't learn if they thought a phone call apology would suffice after all these years. And then called him petty and childish? \n\nNo one is actually sorry if SM is still doing it--only worse--and the family is name-calling. \n\nI think OP has every right to be hurt and feel unloved. Because *they hurt him and didn't treat him with love.*", "They think a phone call apology should suffice .They are not truly sorry .\nJust embarrassed that they were shown to be wrong ."]}
