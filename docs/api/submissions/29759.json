The reason for this is that they chose my dad's second wife over me. I was 6 when I lost my mom and 8 when my dad met Diane. I never liked Diane. Initially it was because I saw her presence as being disrespectful to my mom. I was a kid, a little boy who lost his mom and I was a momma's boy so maybe not too surprising. But Diane showed me early that she did not like mentions of my mom. She never said it to my dad or his family, just to me. She'd say it hurt her feelings that I would talk about mom around her like mom was somehow better than her or that I would rather have my mom back. I told my dad and my extended family and they were like oh don't be silly, Diane loves us and she talks about your mom when we do, this is because you don't like your dad moving on.\n\nOver the following few years dad and Diane got married and had kids together and Diane would tell me how much she hated the fact even dad's family missed mom and spoke about her on occasion. She said we were all supposed to be hers now.\n\nThe more I spoke out the more dad would tell me I was trying to ruin his new happiness and that it was cruel to expect him to stay alone forever. I told him he could do better than Diane and I got a lecture from him and my family saying Diane was amazing and mom would have loved her. I even showed them a video I took of Diane making annoyed and disgusted faces and rolling her eyes when mom was mentioned and I was told she knew I was filming and she was sick of my shit.\n\nMy dad agreed to let me go at 16 because I told him I would not try to get along better with Diane and I wanted no part of his family anymore.\n\nTwo months ago Diane exposed herself to the family and really showed them how she felt about mom. One of my cousins was celebrating her birthday and it was one of the milestone birthdays and mom was mentioned and photos were shown of mom since she was my cousins godmother. Diane went off on how she hated my mom and was glad she was dead and she wishes she could erase her from everyone's memories and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nMy dad and his family (minus his younger kids of course) all came crawling back and sent me messages apologizing. I ignored them until it got so overwhelming that they all got together while dad called my grandparents to talk to me. They apologized again and when I said nothing right away they told me I should accept their apology and talk to them. This is when I told them their apology is meaningless to me. They told me I shouldn't say that, I'm being petty, because they're trying to make amends. My dad said nothing was so bad that they couldn't make up for it and I said it was still meaningless. They ended the call pissed off at me and saying I was being childish.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698393923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hikzo/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_family_that_their/", "score": 444, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that they are coming to you saying that you were right, gives you a lot of control on how to proceed from here.", "NTA, but I think you could be a little more understanding. Your stepmom was obviously a good liar and good at hiding her true feelings and manipulating people. She managed to keep the truth from everybody, but seemingly not from you, so she doubled down on you, and successfully drove a wedge between you and your family which resulted in you leaving as  soon as possible, which is probably what she wanted - makes her lies easier.\n\nAnd finally, when the truth came out, whether by accident or design, it will have come as a total shock to your family. It's possible she thought that having driven you away she could safely admit the truth with no consequences, or it's possible it was revealed by accident, caught up in a moment of annoyance and emotion that she couldn't hold back. Either way, you need to give your family some credit for coming straight to you to apologise. They could easily have ignored it, pretended they hadn't been conned and carried on, but they're admitting they were wrong and you were right, which is a big step. However, they obviously don't understand the depth of the hurt you feel, so expecting you instantly to forgive and forget is a big ask, especially if stepmom is still part of the family. There's a bond of trust that needs to be rebuilt which takes time, and they need to work out how to do that. Don't forget that to an extent they were victims in this as well.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but, ESH.  It's entirely your choice as to whether you accept their apology or not, or allow them back into your life or not, but at least they have admitted they were wrong and had the strength of character to reach out and apologise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
