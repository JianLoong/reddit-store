The reason for this is that they chose my dad's second wife over me. I was 6 when I lost my mom and 8 when my dad met Diane. I never liked Diane. Initially it was because I saw her presence as being disrespectful to my mom. I was a kid, a little boy who lost his mom and I was a momma's boy so maybe not too surprising. But Diane showed me early that she did not like mentions of my mom. She never said it to my dad or his family, just to me. She'd say it hurt her feelings that I would talk about mom around her like mom was somehow better than her or that I would rather have my mom back. I told my dad and my extended family and they were like oh don't be silly, Diane loves us and she talks about your mom when we do, this is because you don't like your dad moving on.\n\nOver the following few years dad and Diane got married and had kids together and Diane would tell me how much she hated the fact even dad's family missed mom and spoke about her on occasion. She said we were all supposed to be hers now.\n\nThe more I spoke out the more dad would tell me I was trying to ruin his new happiness and that it was cruel to expect him to stay alone forever. I told him he could do better than Diane and I got a lecture from him and my family saying Diane was amazing and mom would have loved her. I even showed them a video I took of Diane making annoyed and disgusted faces and rolling her eyes when mom was mentioned and I was told she knew I was filming and she was sick of my shit.\n\nMy dad agreed to let me go at 16 because I told him I would not try to get along better with Diane and I wanted no part of his family anymore.\n\nTwo months ago Diane exposed herself to the family and really showed them how she felt about mom. One of my cousins was celebrating her birthday and it was one of the milestone birthdays and mom was mentioned and photos were shown of mom since she was my cousins godmother. Diane went off on how she hated my mom and was glad she was dead and she wishes she could erase her from everyone's memories and a bunch of other stuff.\n\nMy dad and his family (minus his younger kids of course) all came crawling back and sent me messages apologizing. I ignored them until it got so overwhelming that they all got together while dad called my grandparents to talk to me. They apologized again and when I said nothing right away they told me I should accept their apology and talk to them. This is when I told them their apology is meaningless to me. They told me I shouldn't say that, I'm being petty, because they're trying to make amends. My dad said nothing was so bad that they couldn't make up for it and I said it was still meaningless. They ended the call pissed off at me and saying I was being childish.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1698393923, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17hikzo/aita_for_telling_my_dad_and_his_family_that_their/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They did try and they apologized a bunch to me so my response when I finally gave one, after ignoring them for weeks, might not be so great. They did reach out and all have apologized several times now. Not to mention I ignored their apologies for a while. So I could see an argument being made for me being TA and I can see why I might be.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcements\n\n###[Happy Anniversary, AITA!](https://new.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlv9g/almost_better_than_a_double_rainbow_celebrating/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You spent years being scolded and told you were wrong.  An apology over the phone isn't going to erase all of that hurt.", "NTA. They keep on trying to tell you how to feel, rather than respecting those feelings and dealing with you accordingly. It's the same shit now, just with new packaging. I'd be pissed too.\n\nThey did the harm way back when and let the wound scar over. Only you can decide if it's worth trying to repair things and when that process will take place.", "NTA. You can't treat people that bad and then expect them to go on like nothing happened. Maybe they do feel guilty, but it's not an excuse for treating you badly for years and non believing you. A now they still act like AH. Good riddance, you don't need toxic people in your life after all you've been trough.", "NTA   \n\n\nTheir reaction to your reaction says it all, who treats their child like this and then go off on them telling how they should feel when they finally realize they have a reason to apologize? If they really owned up to their regret, they would give you space to react or feel any type of way about their apology and stay in their own lane.", "NTA.\n\nYour father chose his new wife over you. I think we both know who the real asshole is, lad.", "NTA - they didn\u2019t apologise because they feel bad about what they did, they only did it because they were proven wrong.  \nBy making you accept their apology in their mind it wipes away everything they did.", "Nta you had 8 years living in a situation where none of your adult family members had your back, four more years away from your family causes vy this lack of support and they think one apology phone call erases your years of neglect ? Nope, it\u2019ll take a hell of a lot more than that to earn your trust again. Trot on", "NTA every adult in your live failed you, till your Material gp stepped up and took you in.\n\nYou don't need to accept their apology or have them in your live. It is your Life and you decide who you want in it", "NTA they disregarded your feelings when you were a child and they were all fully adults. Just because they are biological family doesn\u2019t mean you have to forgive them and just because they apologize doesn\u2019t mean they deserve forgiveness.", "NTA, but...\n\nTheir apologies are not meaningless. They are VINDICATION!\n\nYou told them what she was doing. They dismissed you. And it got so bad that you moved out. Feel free to hold that over dad's head all you like. \n\nYou now at least can try to repair your relationship, if not right away. \n\nTell them you need time.\n\nYou might be going away to college, if you arent already there. You can work on the relationships in baby steps at your discretion. The fact that they are coming to you saying that you were right, gives you a lot of control on how to proceed from here.", "NTA, but I think you could be a little more understanding. Your stepmom was obviously a good liar and good at hiding her true feelings and manipulating people. She managed to keep the truth from everybody, but seemingly not from you, so she doubled down on you, and successfully drove a wedge between you and your family which resulted in you leaving as  soon as possible, which is probably what she wanted - makes her lies easier.\n\nAnd finally, when the truth came out, whether by accident or design, it will have come as a total shock to your family. It's possible she thought that having driven you away she could safely admit the truth with no consequences, or it's possible it was revealed by accident, caught up in a moment of annoyance and emotion that she couldn't hold back. Either way, you need to give your family some credit for coming straight to you to apologise. They could easily have ignored it, pretended they hadn't been conned and carried on, but they're admitting they were wrong and you were right, which is a big step. However, they obviously don't understand the depth of the hurt you feel, so expecting you instantly to forgive and forget is a big ask, especially if stepmom is still part of the family. There's a bond of trust that needs to be rebuilt which takes time, and they need to work out how to do that. Don't forget that to an extent they were victims in this as well.", "This may be an unpopular opinion but, ESH.  It's entirely your choice as to whether you accept their apology or not, or allow them back into your life or not, but at least they have admitted they were wrong and had the strength of character to reach out and apologise.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
