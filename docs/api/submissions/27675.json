Learning a new language is really tough, especially as an adult. That being said, his refusal to even try to learn a few sentences is rough.

Basically, you speak your language to the children and he speaks his. They are sponges and will learn it a lot easier as kids than adults.", "YTA. I understand the frustration somewhat but your justification for trying to force him doesn\u2019t make any sense.

My partner speaks Spanish. His mom speaks Spanish almost all the time. I took 5 different Spanish classes throughout my years in school. I know just about enough to get around, pick up small bits from conversations so I know at least the topic, stuff like that. I don't have the time and energy to learn more even though I WANT TO. To pick up another language altogether I've no experience with would be rough.\n\nCouple of things. It's really hard to learn a new language as an adult, especially if it's one you've had very little exposure to- how old were you when you learned English (assuming that's what we mean). You speak his language because you live in his country speaking his language there, I would assume- he had no reason to learn your language. It's great that you want your children to speak your language, but forcing him to learn it isn't fair. Asking him to participate, or teaching him little phrases now and again, those are good ways to get started- but making him feel guilty over it isn't fair at all.", "YTA - if this was a big deal to you, you should have laid out the expectation when the relationship started, not for years in.

I totally agree with your reasons for wanting it, but you don't have the right to demand it at this point. If this was a dealbreaker, you should have discussed it early in your relationship. Now? You married a guy who never promised you this.

It was simply a hard boundary for me. Not because I didn\u2019t want to keep translating but simply because to me it mattered that when I go on a tangent when I\u2019m upset I don\u2019t want to keep making sure I\u2019m speaking in English despite growing up bilingual. \n\nHowever, I made that clear from day one.

That said, even if it's a tough language he could learn some basics.\n\nI'd say ESH for not having the conversation before getting married.

Not everyone has an aptitude for learning another language.  It's hard, depending on the language even with instruction.

That\u2019s saying, you really would like him to learn the language, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. If him learning your native language IS a deal breaker, then why did you guys get married?

One of yours or a third language? Aka is it like you speak Mandarin, he speaks French, and you live in England - or is it like you speak German, he speaks English, and you live in England? \n\nIf it's the latter, then I wouldn't say you learned his language out of love or anything, you learned it out of necessity to live in the country you're living in? \n\nOr if you DID learn it simply for your partner - did you tell him then that you expected the same? Or that it was important to you? Culture is one thing - language is another. Many diasporic cultures intermarry without a language learning expectation - something like that is dependant on you and him being explicit, if you had always wanted him to learn, then it should have been an early days conversation. \n\nI think wanting to have your language passed down to your children is a perfectly normal thing to want, and that itself doesn't make you an AH - hence why I think the commenter straight up telling you you're a horrible unforgivable person whose husband should leave you, needs to tone down the unhingedness by a few levels. \n\nWhat does put you in AH territory is the sudden expectation - you can't say your partner is uncaring and awful if you had never expressed from the start that the language is important to you. If you HAD done so and he refused - why are you with him? If you knew that wasn't a priority for him, then you should not have stayed with him. \n\nI'm South Asian, speak 4 languages fluently, and my partner is white British who only spoke English growing up. From Day 1 I told him that it was important to me that my children were bilingual - they would of course be fluent in English from growing up in the UK, so I wanted them to know my language as well. For 7/8 of the years we've been together, he has made an effort to learn it. He's nowhere near fluent because it's a hard language for Brits (second language provision in UK schools is awful), but he tries his best, and he will always try his best with my parents (who speak English anyway), and he is more than happy for our kids to be bi, or even trilingual. \n\nSo yeah, I am sympathetic to you wanting to hold on to your language, because it can be rough when you are the only one in your family who thinks, counts, dreams in a language that the rest aren't willing to learn. But if it is that important - then it had to have been important from the start, and you should have told him, and not continued the relationship if he was unwilling from the start. What you're doing right now is not you respecting your language, it is you disrespecting it by not giving it a thought until years and years on. \n\nYou can't force someone to learn a language - they will resent it. And that resentment will pass to your children, who will then be resenting a language that is *half their culture*. That is what you could have avoided by making this a priority conversation early on.", "YTA. My husband is from Finland and I tried to learn the language, but it's really hard.

I don't think it's my fault that they can only speak 1 language. \nMy husband is fine with my decision.", "NTA every commenter on here is used to just bashing around the world and most people they encounter speak at least some English. It is completely reasonable of you to request your husband learn your language so that your children grow up speaking it. It makes sense that this is an issue that has come up now instead of earlier, as the new factor is kids. Further you have to translate literally everything he says to you, he could at least make an effort to learn so you don\u2019t have to do that at all times.

Now it feels to him like a power struggle, probably. I am not sure about the identity-thing, it sounds to me you have that all of a sudden in your head since becoming kids is more and more of a possibility. \nHowever, you are right in him learning basics, so he can also understand what his future bilingual kids are saying to you and be able to interact with his in-laws. However, how well do you expect him to speak or understand the language? As long as you do not live in your homecountry, getting fluent is a bit much to ask. Also, how far removed is it from his mother tongue, and how complicated is it? If he speaks english, learning french is something different than german, russian, persian or chinese. Also, he might be one of these people who have a hard time picking up a language.\n\nSo, what is your expectation in terms of quality from him (and in what timeframe)? Maybe it is just a bit of miscommunication. He sees this unclimbable mountain in front of him to study a language in depth and learn how to write poems in it, and you just want him to be able to say stuff like \"yes\", \"no\" and \"i do not want to buy this car\" and follow easy conversations?\n\nAlso, how much time does your husband have on his hand to learn a new language, and what does he work?

There was already Korean language already before the writing system was developed/created in the 1400s.

Can you imagine learning all of them, as an adult, in a class? One of them requires that you know the meaning of the rather obscure word \u201cpanoply\u201d. Another requires that you understand the concept of infinity. Some require that you understand hyperbole. Others require that you know that \u201ca ton\u201d is a metaphor for \u201ca large amount\u201d.  The English language is a fucking nightmare.", "As my second language it is not that difficult, for me the only difficulty is the spelling.", "I have heard most people say that English was a very difficult language.

Being able to politely greet the parents in their own language is important even if that's all you can do. \n\nThe whole idea about languages being more difficult is also irrelevant. It doesn't matter if you completely butcher the language or can't say but a few words. It's the thought and effort behind trying to learn that counts. \n\nExpecting a partner to put in a bit of effort to speak to your family is never an unreasonable demand IMO. I honestly feel like the opposite is true and any partner who isn't willing to put that effort in is extremely inconsiderate. It's especially important if you plan on having kids since they will almost certainly be learning the other parent's native language.", "Guys promise they'll learn it, then they put it off, then they say it's \"too hard\" (even though they'll put a lot of effort into other things that are hard), then have another excuse.

It\u2019s very easy to pick up the basics. Fluency and full facility, however\u2026that\u2019s a whole different story. \n\nLet\u2019s compare English to its close cousin, French. If I learn French, I have to spend a lot of time up front learning a whole bunch of rules and a few exceptions. Once I learn those rules, it\u2019s fairly easy to predict how new words will fit into them. (Slang is, of course, excepted from this. Same with any language.)\n\nBut if I learn English, I have to learn what rules exist but also A LOT of irregularities. Both in conjugations and spelling and pronunciation and sentence structure. There isn\u2019t a ton of rhyme or reason to it. And you as a native speaker follow rules you\u2019re not even aware of - do you know why \u201ccute little red wagon\u201d sounds fine but \u201cred cute little wagon\u201d sounds off? Most people don\u2019t and aren\u2019t even aware that there is a proper order to adjectives. We just do it without thinking. But imagine being a new English speaker and having to learn to say them in order of opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, then purpose, but that this rule sometimes goes out the window because of ablaut reduplication, which rearranges words in a different particular order. So you know Big Bad Wolf is correct even if you don\u2019t know that you\u2019re following an exception to a rule that you also don\u2019t know you would otherwise be following. Sounds like gibberish, right? But as a native speaker you DO understand it even if you don\u2019t know you do.

If you wanted to be with someone who spoke your language, you should\u2019ve married someone who already did. It\u2019s unreasonable to request him to learn a new language because of your life choices.

Tossed myself down a rabbit hole earlier the difficulty learning English apparently varies wildly based on age, native language, etc. Way more than I realised - and I\u2019ve definitely heard non-native speakers complain.\n\nAlso learned Indonesian, the language in question, is actually considered fairly easy for native English speakers to learn. Easier than I\u2019d thought.\n\n\nAnd that the language I\u2019ve chosen to learn (Turkish) is supposedly fairly difficult but I\u2019m gonna disagree on that one lol.", "Exactly. Though India's national language is Hindi, English is probably the most widely spoken language after Hindi in India.
