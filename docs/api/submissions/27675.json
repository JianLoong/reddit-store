Learning a new language is really tough, especially as an adult. That being said, his refusal to even try to learn a few sentences is rough.

Basically, you speak your language to the children and he speaks his. They are sponges and will learn it a lot easier as kids than adults.", "YTA. I understand the frustration somewhat but your justification for trying to force him doesn\u2019t make any sense.

My partner speaks Spanish. His mom speaks Spanish almost all the time. I took 5 different Spanish classes throughout my years in school. I know just about enough to get around, pick up small bits from conversations so I know at least the topic, stuff like that. I don't have the time and energy to learn more even though I WANT TO. To pick up another language altogether I've no experience with would be rough.\n\nCouple of things. It's really hard to learn a new language as an adult, especially if it's one you've had very little exposure to- how old were you when you learned English (assuming that's what we mean). You speak his language because you live in his country speaking his language there, I would assume- he had no reason to learn your language. It's great that you want your children to speak your language, but forcing him to learn it isn't fair. Asking him to participate, or teaching him little phrases now and again, those are good ways to get started- but making him feel guilty over it isn't fair at all.", "YTA - if this was a big deal to you, you should have laid out the expectation when the relationship started, not for years in.

I totally agree with your reasons for wanting it, but you don't have the right to demand it at this point. If this was a dealbreaker, you should have discussed it early in your relationship. Now? You married a guy who never promised you this.

It was simply a hard boundary for me. Not because I didn\u2019t want to keep translating but simply because to me it mattered that when I go on a tangent when I\u2019m upset I don\u2019t want to keep making sure I\u2019m speaking in English despite growing up bilingual. \n\nHowever, I made that clear from day one.

That said, even if it's a tough language he could learn some basics.\n\nI'd say ESH for not having the conversation before getting married.

Not everyone has an aptitude for learning another language.  It's hard, depending on the language even with instruction.

It is unlikely that he will ever be fluent\u2014or even good enough that you want your kids hearing him speak in it while they\u2019re still learning.\n\nThen there is all the logistical issues. How common is your language in your area\u2014are there resources for learning it? How much free time and brainpower does your husband really have?

That\u2019s saying, you really would like him to learn the language, but it\u2019s not a deal breaker. If him learning your native language IS a deal breaker, then why did you guys get married?

One of yours or a third language? Aka is it like you speak Mandarin, he speaks French, and you live in England - or is it like you speak German, he speaks English, and you live in England? \n\nIf it's the latter, then I wouldn't say you learned his language out of love or anything, you learned it out of necessity to live in the country you're living in? \n\nOr if you DID learn it simply for your partner - did you tell him then that you expected the same? Or that it was important to you? Culture is one thing - language is another. Many diasporic cultures intermarry without a language learning expectation - something like that is dependant on you and him being explicit, if you had always wanted him to learn, then it should have been an early days conversation. \n\nI think wanting to have your language passed down to your children is a perfectly normal thing to want, and that itself doesn't make you an AH - hence why I think the commenter straight up telling you you're a horrible unforgivable person whose husband should leave you, needs to tone down the unhingedness by a few levels. \n\nWhat does put you in AH territory is the sudden expectation - you can't say your partner is uncaring and awful if you had never expressed from the start that the language is important to you. If you HAD done so and he refused - why are you with him? If you knew that wasn't a priority for him, then you should not have stayed with him. \n\nI'm South Asian, speak 4 languages fluently, and my partner is white British who only spoke English growing up. From Day 1 I told him that it was important to me that my children were bilingual - they would of course be fluent in English from growing up in the UK, so I wanted them to know my language as well. For 7/8 of the years we've been together, he has made an effort to learn it. He's nowhere near fluent because it's a hard language for Brits (second language provision in UK schools is awful), but he tries his best, and he will always try his best with my parents (who speak English anyway), and he is more than happy for our kids to be bi, or even trilingual. \n\nSo yeah, I am sympathetic to you wanting to hold on to your language, because it can be rough when you are the only one in your family who thinks, counts, dreams in a language that the rest aren't willing to learn. But if it is that important - then it had to have been important from the start, and you should have told him, and not continued the relationship if he was unwilling from the start. What you're doing right now is not you respecting your language, it is you disrespecting it by not giving it a thought until years and years on. \n\nYou can't force someone to learn a language - they will resent it. And that resentment will pass to your children, who will then be resenting a language that is *half their culture*. That is what you could have avoided by making this a priority conversation early on.", "YTA. My husband is from Finland and I tried to learn the language, but it's really hard.

I don't think it's my fault that they can only speak 1 language. \nMy husband is fine with my decision.", "NTA every commenter on here is used to just bashing around the world and most people they encounter speak at least some English. It is completely reasonable of you to request your husband learn your language so that your children grow up speaking it. It makes sense that this is an issue that has come up now instead of earlier, as the new factor is kids. Further you have to translate literally everything he says to you, he could at least make an effort to learn so you don\u2019t have to do that at all times.

Now it feels to him like a power struggle, probably. I am not sure about the identity-thing, it sounds to me you have that all of a sudden in your head since becoming kids is more and more of a possibility. \nHowever, you are right in him learning basics, so he can also understand what his future bilingual kids are saying to you and be able to interact with his in-laws. However, how well do you expect him to speak or understand the language? As long as you do not live in your homecountry, getting fluent is a bit much to ask. Also, how far removed is it from his mother tongue, and how complicated is it? If he speaks english, learning french is something different than german, russian, persian or chinese. Also, he might be one of these people who have a hard time picking up a language.\n\nSo, what is your expectation in terms of quality from him (and in what timeframe)? Maybe it is just a bit of miscommunication. He sees this unclimbable mountain in front of him to study a language in depth and learn how to write poems in it, and you just want him to be able to say stuff like \"yes\", \"no\" and \"i do not want to buy this car\" and follow easy conversations?\n\nAlso, how much time does your husband have on his hand to learn a new language, and what does he work?

You suck", "Let me ask you something. Is English the language you learned? Or is it another language that isn't spoken, you know, across the world for hundreds of reasons?", "Yep.  I am terrible at languages, but picked up some when there and was oddly able to figure out a lot of the signs.", "I don't know if you have this in your area, but a number of places in the US have Saturday and afternoon programs for kids to keep up with their parental languages.\n\nI really don't know why folks here are berating you so hard! It's understandable that you'd like him to learn a little of your familial language. However, if he's American, we just do not have the same kind of background in languages that many other places in the world have, so we can be much more resistant to it.\n\nNAH.", "I'm sorry people are being so negative toward you here.  I would feel really disheartened and irritated with him if I were you.  For him to refuse to make any effort to learn means you have to carry the whole communication burden in your relationship, which is exhausting.  I dated someone who wouldn't start learning English even though he promised to, and it made everything more tiring and frustrating.  I had to speak a foreign language all the time, even if I was tired, sick, etc., because he couldn't be bothered to learn a little of my language.  To me, that's laziness.  How is he going to get along if he goes to your country?  You're going to be the 24-hour on call translator?  How is he going to communicate with your family members?  Make you translate everything all the time?  It's unfair for all of the communication work to be on your shoulders.", "So teach your kids - just because he doesn't know it doesn't mean you can't teach them. and the younger you start them, the easier it will be.", "My point is if they WANT to learn it, that\u2019s great. You have no right to demand it of anyone.\n\nIf it was such an issue, you shouldn\u2019t have began a relationship with someone who speaks a different language.  Too late now. \n\nYTa", "It might be, bit there also might be other reasons. You speak five languages, that is a lot. So maybe it feels to you like no biggie, while for him it seems like a huge new task which he does not know how to deal with.\n\nI mean, maybe he also wants to spent time with you instead of sitting in a classroom?", "I speak several languages fluently and totally agree. OP is in fact disrespecting the importance of her language to herself by never bringing it up or caring, and then suddenly demanding it. My partner is/was a \"monoglot Anglophone\" too but many of those can and do often try to learn if the expectation was set from Day 1 instead of forcibly chucked into the mix after marriage.", "Whats unreasonable is going 4 years without ever trying to learn your partner's native language. \n\nThat's what I think is missing here. Someone's native language is *always* a core part of them, whether they make a big deal of it or not. I get that languages aren't easy for everyone, but 4 years without having even tried is baseline asshole behaviour, even if OP never asked him to.", "If my wife was from a different culture where English was not the native language, and wanted to raise our children to be bilingual, she wouldn't have to demand. I would do that without asking or hesitating. Learning languages is difficult, but worthwhile, and being able to speak multiple languages is a huge benefit.", "You don\u2019t have to lose your identity or culture because your spouse doesn\u2019t know yours. Italian Americans haven\u2019t lost theirs even though many do not speak the native tongue. Teach your kids your language and culture.  Maybe when your spouse hears you having a conversation with the kids their mind may change to wanting to know. The only person missing out here is your spouse. Move on and accept that he doesn\u2019t want to learn.", "You may want to bring that up to him, then. He likely hasn't considered it (you + the kid 'talking without him'). But you can't force him. If he still refuses, though, remind him of that once those you/kid conversations start up and he starts complaining about it.", "I\u2019ve seen friends trying to raise trilingual kids\u2014meaning that each of the parents speaks a different native language and they try to raise the kids in English and both of their native languages. It worked for a little while till the kids started school. The parents still try engaging the kids in their languages, but the kids only respond in English. They\u2019re not interested, and why would they? They have nobody else in their circle to speak those languages to. It\u2019s the reality. Don\u2019t get your hopes too high.    \n\nI totally understand your identity crisis. I myself went through a similar phase. Eventually you\u2019ll figure it out and live with it. And you don\u2019t need to force it upon your family. Take care.", "I love him,just annoyed atm...", "That's right, blame the victim. He didn't sign a pre nup that he wouldn't learn her language did he? Now it's important to OP and as her SO he could at least try to learn some phrases and sentences to start with. He sounds so uncompromising.", "That's the conversational method. It can work really well if it's slowly ramped up. Doing it over activities you both enjoy and are familiar with can be especially fun.", "Took Spanish throughout high school and according to our teacher, we were \"basically fluent. You just need to spend time immersed to pick up slang etc.\"\n\nDidn't continue in college cause its expensive and I was \"basically fluent\". Now, I think I could pick it back up if I was dropped into a Spanish speaking country, but it'd still be horrible. I definitely can't form more than basic sentences off the top of my head now. The only thing I've truly retained is the accent so I don't sound like a total noob", "English is absolutely not the easiest language in the world but I agree that Indonesian languages are notoriously tough", "You\u2019re absolutely right about Asian languages being very difficult to learn but\u2026English is also a very difficult language. Our grammar structure is illogical and varies wildly between dialects, there\u2019s essentially no rules, half the alphabet has six different ways it can pronounced.", "English is extremely difficult, fwiw.", "Or he will learn as his children learn", "I AM loving and living with his one language but being in a relationship also means growing and improving together. We never even had a fight or anything about it. I'm just upset. I feel extremely disconnected from everything.", "I agree with the asshole judgement but I feel like you\u2019re way overreacting here wtf", "OP is in the wrong, but I feel like yours is a genuinely insane way to approach this situation, and *checks notes* very \"little person and mean spirited\".", "Over-reaction much? I agree with the judgement but your response is way over the top.", "You kinda went from 0 to 100 there...", "Don't you think that's a little too much when you practically know nothing about my life?", "You're making a lot of assumptions saying he never tried. Some people do not have an aptitude for languages and it is especially difficult for adults. 100% chance that OP learned to speak English as a child in school.", "Your aptitude and/or interest in learning other languages is great for you. That obviously doesn't give you a reason or permission to expect or demand it of others, which is what she is doing. I am certainly interested in other languages and have studied French, Spanish, and Italian throughout my life,  but if my boyfriend or husband spoke Hindi I would have a lot of trouble learning it and probably would never become fluent. If he demanded that I learn it I would kick his ass to the curb in a New York minute.", "I'm sure he isn't annoyed at all by a sudden demand to learn a new language.... please respond to me in my native tongue bumblefuckian. South meadow bumblefuck to be exact. Don't talk to me until you do. You see how easy that was. I didn't have to marry you or anything.", "Annoyed or annoying?", "I\u2019m sorry, what exactly is OP a victim of? I must have missed that part\u2026", "The victim of what...?", "Did he sign a prenup stating that he would learn one?", "It is fairly easy in comparison to other languages, OP learned \u201chis\u201d language which is just English.. she was probably planning to learn that anyways, OP\u2019s ridiculous for not bringing this up earlier if it was so important.", "Unfortunately OP this is your problem to solve. Demanding that your husband learn another language is not going to make YOU feel more connected to your culture. You need to figure out what you need to do to make that happen, without making demands on other people.", "That is your problem not your husband's.", "No.", "Yeah, but I feel like it was warranted. She's going to give him a hard time and be resentful about this for the rest of his life. She needs to snap out of it.", "We know enough to conclude that much.", "That's great for you, but I don't think asking your partner to learn new skills (such as languages) is unreasonable, personally, so we'll have to agree to disagree on this one!\n\nThough, again, this is definitely a conversation that the two of them should have had *before* marriage.\n\nIf one party isn't willing to learn new skills for their partner, and the other partner has the expectation that they should, then that's probably a doomed marriage from the start.", "The victim of the patriarchy?", "OP already knew his language, that's different.", "also, not to be mean, but there's a huge difference between learning a language that is spoken widely globally and that is tremendously practical vs. learning a very difficult language that you would literally only be learning for your spouse's emotional benefit and to teach your child without any other routine exposure. That's a lot of time, really hard work, and frustration for something with little practical use and would be a hard sell for most people, no matter how much they love the person who is asking.", "So I'm a chemist. I should demand that my partner learn chemistry? Give me a break. Yeah we'll definitely have to agree to disagree", ">So I'm a chemist. I should demand that my partner learn chemistry?\n\nr/whoosh.\n\nIf that's your takeaway from my comment, we're definitely done. I'm not here to argue. Have a good one."]}
