My biggest criticism against these bullshit claims is God is omnibenevolent - all forgiving, all loving, regardless of culture, creed, sexuality, to say otherwise is a contradiction and undermines God. It\u2019s no secret how common homosexuality or bisexuality was throughout history and to condemn someone on a sexual preference is disgusting.

Has he told her that he is sorry for the way he treated you?  Did he tell her that they cut you off and not the other way around? I'm betting not.  I am betting that he and your parents told her some lies about why you don't speak to them anymore, and will expect you to continue those lies.\n\nI understand you want to help this girl, but since she will bring the rest of the toxicity into your life, I don't see how you can.

I was raised religeous (though parents were always about kindness and never judged other (Matthew 7 :: NIV. \"Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. \"Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?) \n\nIf indeed the christianity stuff is truth, then her parents will rot in hell along with her brother.        Myself, I plan on living forever....so far so good.", "Nowhere does op say that she cut contact 5 years prior.\n\nI checked the automod post, and there's been no changes to the post. Where did you see that?", "She said she was 22, now 27 dating a girl. But brother was 30 and now 35? Also kid is 12, mom died at 3, so the 9 years add up IF the family disowned her Then SIL died. Still weird math.", "That threw me off as well. Very weird.", "That, or OP doesn't know what \"apparently\" means", "But it doesn\u2019t say wife, it just says child\u2019s mother. If brother and child\u2019s mother were not married and he was raising her, it\u2019s not unreasonable for OP to not know that the mother had died.", "And then loopholes to the loopholes. The Poophole loophole only applies to girls, but the gays then break another rule", "This! Brother is Male\u2122 and shouldn\u2019t have to worry about Female\u2122 things like period pads and bra sizes and other things like this, or he might get Cooties\u2122. He needs his disowned Female sibling to mentor daughter *one* time on these Female things, so that he never has to deal with them again! Because one time is all that OP is going to get, that should be sufficient for daughter to grasp the particulars, and any more contact might contaminate daughter with her Gay cooties\u2122! /s\n\nOP, you were only going to be used and abused in this situation. NTA", "This. NTA. He doesn't want to buy pads. OP should take her niece out and get her some tampons and a padded bra.", "Pride is kid friendly outside of select events that are 21+. Stop bring homophobic, it's 2023 ffs.", "Yea like...celebrations and hanging out with people. Oh the horror!\n\nIf you have children or plan on having them, please refrain from doing birthday parties.", "Some people assume because gay marriage is legal in many western countries that the fight is won and bigotry is over. Pretty sure if my sperm source found out I was bi he'd disown me all over again, and he votes green.", "Of course and I completely understand that, I was just going on the basis that this was for and about their niece. There\u2019s no doubt OP can be an incredible role model to other people, but I was just trying to advice on the premise of their niece because I can only imagine the turmoil and I just wanted them to know that they can be there in spite of their family.", "I figured he didn\u2019t want to have conversations about puberty and periods, so he\u2019d outsource that responsibility to the nearest woman.", "It's the ages. OP mentioned they were outed at 22 and are now 27. Kid is currently 12 but the mom died when the kid was 3. If the brother was close enough to give ultimatums 5 years ago why didn't OP know about the kid when they were 7 and been eith thr brother for 4 years? Only way it makes sense if is the kid was adopted or the brother didn't find out until a couple years after outing OP. Either way it's not really integral to the story unless we think it's all fake.", "It says she's 27 and this happened when she was 22. Math.", "It all fits . Op s brother now when the kid is 12 needs a female figure for his daughter. He didn't need anyone when she was little. Or am I missing something?!", "My mom won\u2019t come to my \u201chomosexual wedding\u201d yeah, that\u2019s what she calls it\u2026because god doesn\u2019t approve and she doesn\u2019t want people to think she\u2019s a hypocrite\u2026I told her that everyone (including god) knows she\u2019s a homophobe so I don\u2019t see the issue\u2026\ud83d\ude06 my partner and I have been together for 15 years- living together for 11 years. My mom is in a high control religion/cult and off her fuckin nut.", "not the asshole is n t a. n a h is no assholes here. meaning no one is at fault.", "Oh huh, I completely missed that!", "I think it's the \"apparently\" that OP added since it makes it sound like she didn't know the mom died. They probably just wrote it weird though.", "Op said \"apparently\" her mother died, as if OP didn't know.", "I think the confusion is from how it's written. Was she ratted out 9 years ago or 5 years ago? I'm thinking it was 9 years ago. (And dad doesn't want to deal with periods)", "Youre missing the \"apparently\" on the mother dying when the kid was 3, so 9 years ago. 4 years before the outing and disowning", "Yeah well same Leviticus chapter also says a man sleeping with his neighbor's wife, both of them shall be put to death. Don't see any one following THAT little rule.", "There's nothing in the bible to support homophobia.", "It does not \u201ccut both ways\u201d because OP is not claiming (or proclaiming) that they love the lord. Only the brother is being a hypocrite by claiming religious authority while neglecting his family responsibilities", "Well, your moms an idiot! Can I come as your gramma? \n\nCongratulations on your upcoming wedding.", "Thank you!! I was thinking \u201cnot asshole\u201d. Thank you for correcting me. \ud83d\ude0a", "There's a section in there saying (roughly) that if two men are fighting and the wife of one of them kicks the other in the balls (or something like that) that she'll be put to death.  I always thought that was an oddly specific law.  Probably written by someone who was kicked in the nuts.", "Yaaaaassss queen. Thank you for the kind words. \ud83d\udc95", "no problem :)", "I get to be a QUEEN! \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc75\ud83e\udd29 Any time my friend. I might be an random old lady, but I really am happy for you.\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udf08"]}
