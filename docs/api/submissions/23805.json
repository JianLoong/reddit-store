Personally i LOVE how you shut him down by quoting the bible back at him.

Do you not know if her mother is dead or not? That's a fairly easy thing to check.", "NTA", "NTA! It doesn't matter whether or not your niece is innocent, you've got to take care of yourself first. There's no reason to subject yourself to that hatred", "NTA. Don\u2019t go back they will just use that relationship to control you.", "Oh hell no! NTA. Yeah, your niece won\u2019t have a role model, but at the same time, your brother is being a jerk. And a family that disowns another for an asinine reason like being bi doesn\u2019t deserve your time or effort. Stay away.", "NTA\n\nBut I would suggest, if this doesn\u2019t interfere with your mental health, keeping an eye on your niece. If she is bisexual, gay, trans, or any other thing that goes against her father\u2019s beliefs, she might need an adult that accepts her as she is\u2026 and we clearly know that your brother (and probably other people she is close to) won\u2019t be that person.", "I swear this one was posted on here a few weeks ago.

It\u2019s such a blow be it family or people we care about when they segregate us like this.\n\nYour brother is an asshat and I can\u2019t condone that. My biggest criticism against these bullshit claims is God is omnibenevolent - all forgiving, all loving, regardless of culture, creed, sexuality, to say otherwise is a contradiction and undermines God. It\u2019s no secret how common homosexuality or bisexuality was throughout history and to condemn someone on a sexual preference is disgusting. Yet again, a nice safety net and method for dealing with the unknown is corrupted by man because religion isn\u2019t bad, the people who uphold it and use it for their own means are bad. \n\nI can completely understand your standpoint, your views and feelings are valid, be it family or not, blood doesn\u2019t matter or justify people being toxic or horrible. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019d say, is you seem of sound mind, anyone open minded and of the world is - your niece will need that. It\u2019s entirely your decision, but as you said your niece is an innocent and you have no obligation or need to put yourself in that position. The only thing I will say is we need more people like you in the world and though it means self sacrifice sometimes for the greater good, if it were me, I\u2019d want my niece, child, whoever it may be to have a role model like you in their life. For their sake and their sake alone, think about it, no one else matters, be the change you want to see.

I can't imagine them agreeing to that (or keeping to that agreement for any length of time), but you know them better than I. If that is a possibility, you'd be able to improve your niece's life and expand her horizons. But as I said, I don't imagine they'll accept or keep to that agreement.\n\nI think your brother burned his relationship with you and now wants to pretend it's intact. You are under no obligation to pretend along with him.", "NTA - I hope that you also told him that it\u2019s  fine and good that he \u201coverlooks\u201d your transgressions, but you aren\u2019t willing to overlook his.", "NTA\n\nAs for your relationship with your niece: reading between the lines, it sounds as though you\u2019d like to have a relationship with her, or at least explore the possibility.

The only absolutes in this scenario are whatever boundaries you set with respect to your bio family if you choose to be part of your niece\u2019s life, because I think what you\u2019re trying to avoid here are flying monkeys trying to pull you back into the fold under THEIR conditions", "Good lord, NTA.   He makes your life harder for years, and expects you to feel lower than him by saying that he is willing to overlook your transgressions?!?  What transgressions?  What did you ever do to him?    He says god commands us to forgive, but then doesn't even say he forgives you, just that he will overlook them. As in he will keep thinking about how bad he feels you are, but pretend that he doesn't.  Gee thanks for all that grace.  Meanwhile he breaks Jesus commandment about loving others as I have loved you every moment he thinks of you as less than he.  And he still is doing it.\n\nSo now that it benefits him, he can see the value of having you, who he sees as damaged, and transgressing against god, in his life?  \n\nPlease don't take this on.  You know the misery having him back in your life will inflict to you.  You don't owe him more suffering.  Don't think that you are the only person that he knows that can take an active role in her life.   Since he is a Christian, he can pray for the right female figure to appear.  He can find someone at his church to fill that role.  He can find one of the gf or wives of his friends, or someone else, or speak to her doctor about resources.  Just because you are his first choice doesn't mean you are his best choice.\n\nDid he tell you that he now totally accepts LGBTQIA+ people with a whole heart, and fully expects you to share your life story with your niece?  Has he told her that he is sorry for the way he treated you?  Did he tell her that they cut you off and not the other way around? I'm betting not.  I am betting that he and your parents told her some lies about why you don't speak to them anymore, and will expect you to continue those lies.\n\nI understand you want to help this girl, but since she will bring the rest of the toxicity into your life, I don't see how you can.  I'm sorry.", "Stay out of it. I know you might be feeling bad for your niece but this is the best option for you", "NTA. I'm sorry about your niece and her mom, but you need to stay away. He betrayed you and thought nothing of it. Now he needs/wants something from you, so he's \"willing to overlook your transgressions\"? Nah. This is not a safe person for you to be around or have any contact with. He can sign her up for Big Sisters or ask the school about a mentor.", "NTA but this is tough. On the one hand you have the chance to help your niece, on the other hand you would be at considerable risk if something goes wrong.....such as false accusations is his daughter is gay or prefers your morals to his.\n\n\nProbably best to stay away", "NTA. Your brother commanded you to forgive and said he forgave you for what exactly? Basically a dude that betrayed your trust 5 years ago now wants you to bend backwards for him. \nHere is a novel idea - your niece is not your responsibility. You don't owe her. Too bad, so sad.

She is not your responsibility when you've been disowned.\n\nThe petty part of me says you should mentor her, teach her to be open and accepting and try to pull her away from that cult.

Regardless, it's not your responsibility to manage her mentorship or that situation, nor to go back into a situation where you'll be judged and made to feel lesser because of who you are.
