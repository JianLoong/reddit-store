My biggest criticism against these bullshit claims is God is omnibenevolent - all forgiving, all loving, regardless of culture, creed, sexuality, to say otherwise is a contradiction and undermines God. It\u2019s no secret how common homosexuality or bisexuality was throughout history and to condemn someone on a sexual preference is disgusting.

It\u2019s entirely your decision, but as you said your niece is an innocent and you have no obligation or need to put yourself in that position. The only thing I will say is we need more people like you in the world and though it means self sacrifice sometimes for the greater good, if it were me, I\u2019d want my niece, child, whoever it may be to have a role model like you in their life.

He can find someone at his church to fill that role.  He can find one of the gf or wives of his friends, or someone else, or speak to her doctor about resources.  Just because you are his first choice doesn't mean you are his best choice.\n\nDid he tell you that he now totally accepts LGBTQIA+ people with a whole heart, and fully expects you to share your life story with your niece?  Has he told her that he is sorry for the way he treated you?  Did he tell her that they cut you off and not the other way around? I'm betting not.  I am betting that he and your parents told her some lies about why you don't speak to them anymore, and will expect you to continue those lies.\n\nI understand you want to help this girl, but since she will bring the rest of the toxicity into your life, I don't see how you can.

A 12 year old shouldn't have totally unmonitored online time though, and I wouldn't want contact with my brother or parents to organize it, or risk them reading what we were discussing (or worse, pretending to be her and responding!).

Like even if he didn't find a wife, he'd have plenty of women in his church to reach out to- people who align more with his lifestyle choices.

My guess would be one of two things- either he's really deeply embedded with some more traditional gender ideas and wants to totally avoid talking about anything related to puberty or sexuality with his daughter, but also can't speak about that to other women in his church...or he or he and your parents are trying to use her as the pawn to get you back in communication with the family. Maybe they've seen from a distance that you're (shockingly!) normal, and don't want to apologize but do want to have some connection. Maybe they realized that the daughters tend to be caretakers in the family, and parents are getting older and need a backup plan. Maybe they've heard you're financially better now and want to have you start contributing to the niece/parents/widower brother? Who knows? If he's not reaching out genuinely apologizing and begging forgiveness and admitting fault, then he's doing the opposite- he hasn't changed, at least in this way.

Forgiveness doesn't have to involve reconciliation or connection, it's just not letting the harm someone did to you take up space in your head. I would never reconcile with a family member or friend who did this to their sibling or child- I'd make sure they knew how upset I was and why I was ending the relationship with them, and doubling down on making sure their cut off family member was supported.

I don't get that. If something needs to be said you say it. Who cares what they might say in return? So what?  And your answer doesn't even make sense. Usually when people do this, \"well they'll just say...\" on top of that being incredibly wrong and annoying, the things people usually write, what they will respond with, are also incredibly stupid things. We need a name for people that do stuff like this, I see it all the time, it's annoying, it's totally wrong, and usually like I said, it's a response like yours, which doesn't even fit the situation. \n\nFor now on, say what needs to be said and WHO CARES WHAT IS SAID IN RESPONSE, plug your ears if it bothers you.", "And he's only reaching out now that his kid is 12??? This sounds like he's desperate and has no one else to talk to her about puberty, so he's willing to use his sister under the guise that he's willing to \"forgive\" her and she should be honored or something.

It\u2019s one of the best ways to not get dragged down to the level of the bigot; and I\u2019m telling you: I couldn\u2019t do it.

I\u2019m slightly older than the brother in this story and I can assure you, very few people our age, especially those who live in the big cities, still hold on to such backward views. \n\nI\u2019m not saying homophobia doesnt exist here, but its waaaay less prevelent than it once was, and if you say something homophobic you\u2019re most likely going to come off worse.", "Yep, keeps us in check!
