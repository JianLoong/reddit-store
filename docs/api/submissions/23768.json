Then three months before they were due to get married we found her cheating on him with his cousin. Noah's cousin is a huge AH who bullied Noah throughout their childhood and into their 20s. So the cheating hurt worse than anything. Noah's cousin was smug as hell when we found him and Rose together and even revealed she had been pregnant with his kid and had an abortion with Noah's money.

She said she wasn't shocked since I always wanted to fuck Noah, which is not true but he's my dearest friend and more family to me than she is. She was with the cousin for a while and then he gave her an STD. She moved away after that.\n\nShe moved closer to home three months ago, with a husband, and was surprised when I treated her like a stranger instead of a sister. She was even more surprised that Noah and I remained close and that he was person of honor in my wedding, a wedding she had not been invited to and had not been aware that I had. She tried to talk things through with me in front of her husband but it became clear he was under the impression it was childish sibling issues between us. She told me we deserve a chance to be close for the first time and she accused me of putting a friend before family. I told her she had some nerve, that she's a shitty human and I would never choose her over Noah.

Her husband asked what the hell we were talking about and I told him what she had done, how she had left things, and that she came back acting like none of it happened and judged me for staying close to Noah.\n\nRose is pissed as hell at me and said I am holding this against her too much, treating her badly, and interfering in her marriage which is none of her business. She tried to retaliate by telling my husband that Noah and I used to be a thing. My husband is still laughing so hard his sides hurt.

This could seem petty for a number of reasons. Mainly because it's been years and while I might still not like her, telling her husband about her past could still be a dick move on my part. It's not like I know the guy and it's not like I didn't know it could hurt her marriage once I realized he had no idea what she'd done.

Whereas the sister is a nasty, cruel, and horrid person who has no problem hurting those who love her and she is meant to love back.
