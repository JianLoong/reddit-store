During their engagement she asked if he would support the two of them while she returned to college for a change of career. He loved her and was more than happy to do this. During this time she was all in on school, or so we all thought, and she left him to take care of everything household related. Then three months before they were due to get married we found her cheating on him with his cousin. Noah's cousin is a huge AH who bullied Noah throughout their childhood and into their 20s. So the cheating hurt worse than anything. Noah's cousin was smug as hell when we found him and Rose together and even revealed she had been pregnant with his kid and had an abortion with Noah's money. The affair had been ongoing for months, almost the entire time he had been maintaining everything by himself while she was supposed to be only dedicated to college.\n\nI was disgusted with Rose and told her I would not stand by her side after what she did to Noah. She said she wasn't shocked since I always wanted to fuck Noah, which is not true but he's my dearest friend and more family to me than she is. She was with the cousin for a while and then he gave her an STD. She moved away after that.\n\nShe moved closer to home three months ago, with a husband, and was surprised when I treated her like a stranger instead of a sister. She was even more surprised that Noah and I remained close and that he was person of honor in my wedding, a wedding she had not been invited to and had not been aware that I had. She tried to talk things through with me in front of her husband but it became clear he was under the impression it was childish sibling issues between us. She told me we deserve a chance to be close for the first time and she accused me of putting a friend before family. I told her she had some nerve, that she's a shitty human and I would never choose her over Noah. That he is there for me like I am him and all she ever did was ignore me and then destroy my best friend. Her husband asked what the hell we were talking about and I told him what she had done, how she had left things, and that she came back acting like none of it happened and judged me for staying close to Noah.\n\nRose is pissed as hell at me and said I am holding this against her too much, treating her badly, and interfering in her marriage which is none of her business. She tried to retaliate by telling my husband that Noah and I used to be a thing. My husband is still laughing so hard his sides hurt. He knows both Noah and I enough to know it's untrue and he trusts me. I told Rose she was still petty as hell.

This could seem petty for a number of reasons. Mainly because it's been years and while I might still not like her, telling her husband about her past could still be a dick move on my part. It's not like I know the guy and it's not like I didn't know it could hurt her marriage once I realized he had no idea what she'd done.

Call me old fashioned, but I've never heard a vow that goes 'till death, or the cessation of communication between siblings, do us part'.", "NTA\n\nWow. She's either deluded or deluded.", "NTA\n\nRose used Noah for support through college, cheated on him with his bully, and even had her child killed to cover up the affair. She is a massive AH.", "YTA it\u2019s weird you\u2019d pick a guy over your own family and hold on to a grudge for such a long time when you weren\u2019t the one who was even betrayed. I think your sister is probably right.", "NTA. Reap what you sow.", "NTA. She is the A.", "What gets me is how Rose retaliated and tried nuking OP's marriage. She hasn't changed one bit and its just a matter of time before her newest plaything realises what's up and ditches her.", "I think the interfering in the marriage is her telling the new husband the truth. Probably because most normal people, if they found out their wife had done that, would have a whole lot of doubts all of the sudden.\n\nShe's still NTA though, and she did no wrong there.", "I didn't just pick a guy. I picked my best friend since we were 4. The person who has been there for me through everything. She was never that person and we were never even close. He's more like family to me than her.", "Are you Rose?", "Noah isn't some guy, he is OP's best friend who had supported his partner and took everything on so she could go to school, which makes him at least from OP's text a pretty decent human being. Whereas the sister is a nasty, cruel, and horrid person who has no problem hurting those who love her and she is meant to love back. Just because she is OP's sister doesn't mean she gets a pass for her horrid behaviour, I know which one I would prefer to have in my life.", "You can\u2019t choose family but you can choose who you surround yourself with. NTA", "No, it's not weird to pick the person who was obviously wronged over the person who cheated on them and used them.  It's crazy you think she should pick the cheating user over the friend who was manipulated and betrayed.", "Well he asked and you answered. She was talking in front of him sooo that is the consequence of that \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "LMAO. So you \u201ctell\u201d her husband nothing but the truth about Rose and she straight up lies, but YOU \u201cwent too far\u201d? No. NTA.", "NTA. Isn't it great when AHs are stupid enough to put themselves into situations where their true selves will certainly be exposed in front of the ones who are still buying their crap?", "NTA she thought she could come back after awhile and downplay everything. She threw asking too much hurt for that.", "NTA.  Rose IS a shitty human being.  Jesus, I've heard some stuff on AITA, but that's a doozy.  And its not like you went out of your way to tell her husband that truth - he asked, you told.  End of story.  If she doesn't like it then maybe she shouldn't have been such a disgrace.  Poor Noah. . . how do you even start to get over that :(", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want him to know what happened, then she shouldn\u2019t have decided to confront you while he was present. She\u2019s not only a crappy person, she\u2019s also pretty stupid. And the fact that her past behavior is negatively impacting her current marriage is sweet karma.", "NTA\n\nBut I want the tea on what her husband said!!! What\u2019s happening there???", "NTA oh I would be so petty, i would let her believe i m gonna fuck her man like she did with noah s cousin lol", "INFO: did she also never speak to any of your parents/family or mutual friends again? Or check social media? How did she not know you got married? \n\nDid you get invited to her wedding?", "NTA. It is your choice to be close to whiever youbwant.\n\nHiw was the relationship to your sisterbefore your falling out?", "NTA.

Your sister is TRASH", "NTA", "NTA, your sister ist a narcissist, everything is never her fault, always another person. Kudos that you told the husband everything, like that she hopefully can't do this sh't with him, too.\n\nOf course she hasn't told him, she did nothing wrong in her eyes. \n\nIt's great that you stayed friends with Noah, he seems like a great guy who hopefully has a better life partner now.", "NTA, play stupid games, win stupid prizes", "NTA. Stay away from Rose, she sounds like the kind of person to burn everything down if she doesn't get her way. I hope Noah was able to find a healthy partner.", "NTA", "Info: How is Noah doing now?", "Tell me she's the youngest sibling without telling me she's the youngest sibling.", "NTA. If I was able to high five you, I would.

Your sister however is a massive asshole and I doubt anyone would abject to you going totally no contact with her.", "NTA.  Honestly given how she wants to rug sweep and the lie she told your husband about you and Noah I think her current husband needs to know exactly what she did.", "NTA - it's right for her husband to know what she is getting himself into and it's your choice to still be mad ad her. After all, she did not do much to reconciliate with you...", "NTA.   Sucks to be her.  She should have been honest from the start.", "Sisters before misters... Gotta support her decisions... They are not yours to make.", "NTA.\n\nIf the truth of your actions paints you in a bad light, maybe don't do it?\n\nAlso, why is it that so many cheating stories end up being with the worst possible person?\n\nLike, I can kindof convince myself that I might, maybe, possibly, forgive my girlfriend/fiancee/wife if she had a one night stand or if she developed some affair with someone at work if I was genuinely lacking. \n\nBut my brother, cousin, or best friend? Nah.\n\nWhat a way to nuke both relationships.", "NTA", "I don't think you're wrong, but we also see plenty of AHs whose reasoning is \"the truth must come out, to everyone, no matter what.\" I think the key here is not that OP told the truth, but that she was minding her own business, living her own happy life without her sister in it, then Rose showed up and forced a confrontation.\n\nIf OP had found out her estranged sister got married and preemptively reached out to Rose's husband to tell him all about how terrible Rose is, that would have been an AH move even if everything she said were true.", "She - quite literally - fucked around and found out. NTA.", "So like 80% of AITA posts\u2026\u2026.", "I think it's weird you'd pick a manipulative cheater who put her own wants above the world over someone who actually acted like family. Family doesn't end or start in blood. It's a choice. I have immediate blood relatives I won't ever speak to again because of how they treated me. But I gained a brother through bond. Did you actually read it? That psycho did enough to cut her out permanently.", "If you don't consider harm brought upon your friends by your own family to be a betrayal, then I would hate to be one of your friends.", "Uh\u2026did you miss all the parts where she described Rose????\nI\u2019d choose a stranger over relatives like that!", "Why should shared DNA and/or childhood home dictate you need to cater to an asshole? And do you not care about your friends at all if you had continued your relationship with Rose after what she did to your best friend?", "It's still all about her getting what she wants, come what may.", "That was messed up and also hilarious when people like Rose think they can tell others who is who and what is what. Like where did she think these people were before she arrived? They just never spoke and got to know each other?? Smdh \n\nNTA OP, she did AH things so telling the truth means saying the AH things she did. That does not make you the AH, just makes her face ugly past - and self given her \u2018retaliation.\u2019\n\nI\u2019m sorry this is the sister you got dealt.", "NTA. If someone telling the truth is interfering in your marriage it\u2019s a sure sign someone in that marriage isn\u2019t being trustworthy and truthful to their spouse. If I was the sister\u2019s husband I would start thinking about instances where sis had, for example, asked for financial support for something and what that money went towards instead\u2026", "I think both you of you should stay out of each other\u2019s lives. She\u2019s more of a AH. but I\u2019m not sure why you even engaged in anything type of conversation with her.  When she started talking about the past, you could have been the bigger person and just shut it down. You have your life, she has hers, end of story"]}
