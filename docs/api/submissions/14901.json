They are real piling on\n\nWhat they're not telling you is that your brother, SIL, and parents are all wanting you to help wrangle the kids. *7 kids under the age of 12???* OH HELL NO. They decided to have these kids, they can figure out how to wrangle them themselves. If necessary, they can hire a babysitter to go with them and help during the trip.\n\nBut of course, if you tell them you're not interested in helping with babysitting, they will all harangue you non-stop about it.\n\nSo instead, tell them \"If something happened with one of our flights, you would lose almost all of your family. It's better if we're on separate flights.\"\n\nAfter we all became adults and my siblings had each had children, we once did a family vacation that involved flying, and my dad insisted that (he + my mom) and we kids all take different flights. That way, if something happened, our family wouldn't be completely wiped out. It's a grim subject and not terribly likely, but it's a possibility. Yes, flying is much safer than driving -- but we would never all go on a trip in the same van or minibus, either.\n\nTell your parents, sorry, your flights are non-refundable, and you're not changing them, but you'll be happy to see them once everyone gets into town.\n\nNTA.\n\nAlso, I recommend you ensure that your accommodation is well separated from that of your brother's family (a different hotel if possible), so you cannot be easily roped into child-minding.", "NTA. Let me guess: you are female? \n\nAnd your parents also mentioned either directly or indirectly that you should help with the kids while on the flight?", "NTA. They can fly with him if they're so concerned.", "NTA - are you supposed to be shacked when travelling like oarsmen in a galleon? WTF", "NTA not at all", "NTA.\n\nAre they going to Legoland? That's going to be super fun for them. I doubt they'll give a shit about anything else.", "NTA. Mom liked to drive rather than fly and I used airline miles to fly and meet them a couple of times. Nobody batted an eyelash; my uncle died and I flew first class to go to the funeral on the other side of the country.\n\nWhen I got to his house, his widow asked if I was hungry and I told her I'd gone first class w miles so they fed me. Uncle was the loyalty program king so she said he'd have been proud of me.", "NTA.

My parents are the only ones who are upset.\n\nMy brother has never once in his life tried to rope me into babysitting or watching his kids. I have offered to babysit on occasion but he's never asked me or tried to pawn his kids off on me or harangued me.\n\nThat's not even why I chose a different flight. We aren't staying in a hotel but even if we were I wouldn't be unhappy if my room was near theirs.", "No on both counts. I'm male. My nieces and nephews or anything about helping was not said or inferred by my parents.

Of all the things to think and worry and stress about before a wedding, this is so low on the list, your parents need to let it go.", "I have said to many people over the years, if ur so worried about it, y don't u do it? There's always some sort of an excuse, but it does serve to get my point across. So, if I were u, OP, I would tell my parents exactly that, and this: If ur so concerned about me flying with brother and his children then change ur arrangements and fly with them. If ur not willing to do that and he is fine with things the way they r then what exactly is ur issue? Am sure if u get a straight forward answer it will b something about how many children there r, and how they will need help with them. At that point I would refer them to brother.
