My best friend (M) will be Josh. His wife will be \nJill. We are all late 20s.\n\nJosh has been my best friend since senior year of college. He was already with Jill at that point. They've been married for years & were together for 6 years before. He is head over heels for her, very proud of her, always calling her the LOHL.\n\nI am good friends w/ Jill too & for the most part she's a lovely person - kind, caring, smart & generous, funny & tough. But there've always been some things about her that rub me wrong. She can come off as demanding & sometimes the way she says things seem barbed. She can make jokes that feel like they're a bit TOO far sometimes. She also leans into the image of being a 'dominant' person. Last, but probably the most annoying to me, is that she has no problem inconveniencing ppl to get what she wants. Especially Josh. He dotes on her & I just feel like sometimes she takes advantage. Examples: we'll all be comfortable in the hot tub at a party & she'll ask HIM to get up & get her a drink. She asks him to leave his own plate at a meal to grab her something she forgot. She often asks him to carry her purse eventually, on a day out & walking around. When we drive together we'll share the aux & she often picks songs that neither Josh nor I like at all & just laugh when we grimace, saying it's her turn so we can deal w/ it. If we're all out together, the night is over the SECOND Jill tells him she'd like to go home, whether or not the rest of us would like to stay out. \n\nI've never said anything to Josh, bc I didn't want to upset him or put my nose in. But a few nights ago, when we were at a party & he'd just brought her a THIRD beer & she'd gone outside with it to take out the host's dog, I pulled Josh aside & said something. Basically just said that I'm kinda worried about him, don't think it's right how Jill makes him wait on her, & asked him if he was really cool with being treated like a servant. He asked what I meant. I told him, I just felt like Jill was rude sometimes & sort of controlling w/ the things she asked for. Josh seemed surprised & sort of laughed it off, saying he was happy to do it & I didn't have to worry. I wasn't rly happy w/ his answer & it kind of made me MORE worried, but I let it go & the night went on.\n\nToday I got a text from Josh saying that he disliked the things I said about Jill, that he didn't appreciate me 'bashing her character', & that he was surprised at me. Then it said that Jill & he are partners, she treats him like gold & that he loves me alot but would prefer if I stayed out of their relationship business. \n\nI'm hurt & kind of pissed. When I talked about it w/ a couple mutual friends, they both said hands down I'm an asshole & that I need to get off Jill's case. But I think she could really stand to work on her manners. Josh is so nice that I worry she takes advantage & he just doesn't see it. I'm letting it go, and respecting his request. But was I really the AH?", "created_utc": 1674015112, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10exm6t/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_that_i_dont_like/", "score": 123, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's high maintenance, for sure, abrasive, possibly, but that is between them.  You will always lose this battle, so unless you have a sincere concern about your friend's well-being, accept that he is ok with her \"flaws\".", "YTA.\n\nIt's not a cute look when you let your jealousy and unrequited feelings get so out of control that you interfere in a marriage like this. What a married couple has between them is NONE of your business. Particularly not when your list of grievances is as silly as yours. You should really be humiliated that your jealousy and shallow understanding of how relationships work was put on display like this.", "Yta.\nIf Josh doesnt mind getting up and grabbing his wife things then its not an issue.\nShe plays music you dont like when its her turn with thr aux? Then dont pass around the aux.\nIf shes tired after a day out and wants to go home and spend some alone time with her HUSBAND shes allowed to do that. No one said you have to end your night because Josh and his wife left\nAbsolutely nothing you said is controlling. Sounds more like you're jealous that Josh is spending time with his wife over you and that you dont have someone who dotes over you like Josh does his wife.\nStop being bitter and get therapy.", "YTA\n\nNothing she does is really controlling.  And frankly, I think you're sensitive to seeing her in a bad light, and ignoring the things she does for him.  Does he listen to her more than you?  Does he take care of her more than you?  That's because they're happily married.  For the sake of your friendship, stay out of their relationship, and maybe get into one of your own.", "YTA ironically YOU sound a bit controlling. Nothing you've said here sounds like she's manipulating him or anything to that effect. She asks him for favours and he does them... does she sound a bit annoying? Yes. But its not your place to just decide its wrong. \n\nIts specifically this whole pulling him to one side and making some big point about that I find particularly weird and intrusive. It would be one thing to make a comment to HER (who you are apparently also friends with) like \"cant you get your own drink\". Still kind of pushy depending on context but like there's something weird about the way you've gone about this.", "Yta - it sounds like you just don't like Jill. My boyfriend LOVES to take care of me by doing little requests like that. I take care of him in other ways.", "YTA. I\u2019m not hearing anything that is to the point where his mental health could be threatened. Maybe he is a bit more of a giver and she\u2019s a bit more of a taker, but that is between the two of them. \n\nIt\u2019s not like she is insulting or belittling to him. She\u2019s not verbally abusive. You should not have stuck your nose in. You should know that things like that are very sensitive and you should only speak up if it is something egregious or extreme. You should apologize to Josh.", "YTA - Jealousy is ugly. I get that you wish you had someone that dotes on you, but Josh is taken. Step back, you aren't going to get him to leave his wife with this, and you WILL lose him as a friend.", "I learned this at a young age. STAY OUT OF OTHERS MARRIAGE ISSUES. Unless it's physical abuse just stay out of it. I was the asshole and said something to a buddy and it almost ruined our friendship and i was sat down and talked to by 2 other married friends and set straight. YTA it's not your business. Once married you'll see.\n\nEdit: most people love their wife/husband more than even a childhood friend. If you talk bad about the SO you will lose everytime, and once married you'll understand. They may vent about them to you but that's not a pass to join in, far from it.", "YTA\n\nAnd are you in love with Josh?\n\nThey have a relationship dynamic that works for them. Some relationships have more of a leader/follower bent, that doesn't make them toxic or wrong. Not if both parties are happy with the arrangement. Nothing you've described makes Jill a bad, toxic, abusive or controlling person. She chooses music *she* likes when it's *her* turn to choose music, regardless of other people's tastes. You could afford to be that assertive. \n\nThis is a big nothingburger. Which leads me to wonder why you are so invested in how you think Josh should be treated when he seems happy. Honestly, if it's me, I start distancing myself from you. And if you still don't respect boundaries, I'd show you the door.", "YTA\n\nYou're sounding like the drinking buddy who's pissed that your best friend's growing up to become a responsible adult while you want to stay out and party.", "YTA  \n\n\nYour HUGE triggering event is that....he brought her three drinks at a party?  It's a kind thing for him to grab the drinks. In fact, at parties, the guy getting the drinks is a gentleman thing to do. \n\nWant to know why? \n\nWhile walking, men take up more space, both physically and just some extra space around them. They also get sexually assaulted less.  They are much less likely to get physically jostled or get their ass grabbed as they travel through a bar/party/crowded area. So they guy goes and gets a drink and goes back. The girl might get jostled or deal with guys wanting to chat or whatever.   \n\n\nIs that always a huge big deal? No. Do plenty of women get their own drinks? Yes. Should all men get the drinks? No.   \n\n\nBut overall, it's a nice thing and a nice habit  for a man to do for a partner he cares about.", "Yep YTA. Every relationship is different, just because you wouldn't tolerate it, doesn't mean others don't. Maybe that's how he makes her feel loved and he's happy to do it. You would tolerate things Jill and Josh wouldn't.\n\nDon't meddle. You see a small fraction of their relationship. \n\nI'm proud to see him stick up for his relationship the way he did.", "This is super cringe. A marriage is more important than a friendship and you\u2019re not required to approve of their dynamic. It\u2019s embarrassing that you think your opinion of their marriage matters. YTA.", "I haven\u2019t carried my own bag or taken my own trash out in a while. But I bake a lot and am very affectionate while my partner is more into acts of service and doing things for me, like Josh. \n\nSeems like you should raise your own relationship standards and work on your jealousy", "YTA. You don\u2019t like his wife. She\u2019s not your cup of tea. That\u2019s fine. But you have no right to interfere in another couples relationship. \n\nIf you can\u2019t control your feelings for him, then you need to stay away from him. It truly sounds like you\u2019re desperate for a way to break them up. You\u2019re not his friend at all.", "YTA. He\u2019s clearly okay with the situation.  It wasn\u2019t your place to say anything.  He responded absolutely correctly.", "YTA, you\u2019re way overstepping and just projecting ideas onto their relationship from the context of this post.\n\nI like getting things and doing similar menial tasks for my partner- not even that I simply don\u2019t mind it, but I actively enjoy it. So yeah, I strive to do a majority of these little deeds because I *want* to.\n\nAnd yeah, if someone passes me the aux I\u2019ll play my own jam, like it or not. You can survive a song you don\u2019t like, this is such an odd \u201cinconvenience\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t harp on someone for playing something I don\u2019t like.\n\nMy partner wants to leave? Yeah chances are I do too- I\u2019m an introvert, it\u2019s how I am. We\u2019re never pressured either way, but it\u2019s no surprise when one person\u2019s done normally a few others are too.\n\nAnd then you make this all a big deal for no reason. You\u2019re nitpicking a snippet of their relationship and insulting her character for\u2026 literally nothing it seems. It\u2019s odd, like you just want to have something against her.", "INFO: you\u2019re secretly in love with Josh, are you not?", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t see anything that is pretty alarming. Josh ending the nights when his wife wants to go home is pretty normal for healthy relationships. If he really would want to stay, nothing is stopping him from staying. Him bringing his wife a beer isn\u2019t alarming either. Or well, it would if she demanded things but it seems like all she does is simply asking. \n\nEveryone has different dynamics and this dynamic works for them. There is nothing wrong with it. \n\nAlso, I think it\u2019s time for you to wake up and get over your crush on Josh. He has a *wife*, he is not interested in you.", "YTA- not your business.", "YTA\n\nJosh\u2019s marriage is absolutely none of your business.", "YTA Op and I know it came from a place of concern for your friend but you should've left it alone unless Josh brought it up 1st. Let me give you a little different perspective. My husband also does things like fetch me drinks etc. I'm not the type to ask for a drink but just get it myself. However he's asked me to do this because he really does like doing things like that.", "YTA if you push this. He told you to stay out of it. IF, you bring it up again, you're showing that you just want to be proven \"right\" instead of listening to what your friend is telling you.", "YTA. he is doing harmless little favors for his wife. asking someone to get you a beer is not abuse.", "YTA. Unless there is obvious abuse taking place, it\u2019s never a good idea to interfere in a marriage. It doesn\u2019t matter in the least what you think about their relationship.\n\nApologize to your friend, and stay in your lane from now on.", "YTA. Unless you suspect actual abuse, don\u2019t comment on other people\u2019s marriages. You\u2019re not privy to all the ins and outs of their relationship, no matter how good of friends you think you are, so while you may feel what you\u2019re witnessing is one-sided with Jill being demanding and Josh being subservient, you have no idea what\u2019s going on behind closed doors. Maybe the roles are reversed at home. Maybe that\u2019s how Josh prefers to show his love and Jill shows hers in another way you\u2019re unaware of. If Josh seems happy and there\u2019s no indication of abuse just keep your comments to yourself.", "YTA so when are you gonna tell Josh that you could treat him so much better than her?", "YTA, It's not your relationship so why are you trying to fuck things up for your homie?\n\nSome girls are demanding and some guys dont give a fuck and will want to please them, she wants to be taken care of, he likes to take care of her, it works for them, it doesnt work for you and it doesnt matter as its not your relationship, he's happy, she's happy, end of.\n\nTbh you actually come off as rather bitter and jealous, she isnt controlling him, and usually when one partner in a couple wants to go home the other partner follows suit cus they are together, your night doesnt have to end cus theirs does, you only end it cus you dont have a josh.", "This exactly happened with my partner's jealous best friend, who trashed me privately to him out of nowhere. We were both devastated and so hurt by the awful things he said about me, especially since my partner has never once complained about me to him.\n\nAfter my partner stood up to him and voiced his disappointment, their friendship was never the same since. \n\nHopefully this won't be the case for you, but be prepared that they stay away from you from now on and that he tells her what you said. \n\nYTA and please seek therapy to deal with your jealousy and resentment. It's none of your business, he has never once complained about her to you, and there is no crime committed by your friend for simply being happy and in love and enjoying to dote on his wife. In fact, he chose to spend the rest of his life with her.", "Yeah YTA\n\n1. Josh said he is happy to get her drinks etc. just because you would have an issue with this in your own relationship does not mean he should and from what you wrote she asks him to get things, she doesn't demand it. You don't know what they are like when they are not around you.\n2. There is nothing wrong with couples going home together when one of them wants to leave, they are married this is pretty common. You know you can continue to stay out with the others even after josh and Jill are gone right?\n3. She is right, when it is her turn to pick a song you should deal with it, you will get your turn and can put on whatever you want.\n\nWhat is your real issue here OP, do you have feelings for Josh?", "I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re disappointed that his wife is more of a priority than drinking with friends, or if you\u2019re bitterly single and pining for Josh?\n\nYTA, are you really telling me in all the these years you\u2019ve never seen Jill do anything for Josh? Or is it more selective memory because you have some gripe with Jill?", "Hands down, YTA. He wasn't asking for help or advice. He likes serving her every whim. That isn't abuse. MYOB.", "YTA, stop being such a hater \u2014 they sound like a lovely couple.", "From this, she sounds mildly inconsiderate. But that's it. Not controlling and certainly not abusive. Maybe look up the definitions of these in relation to relationships, and reassess how and why you came to this conclusion.\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to ask their spouses to get food, drinks, etc. for them. This is their dynamic and it's not up to you to judge it. This might just be their love language. He likes to perform acts of service for her, and she likes to receive it. \n\nThough, I think you have more of a problem with Jill than with their relationship. If you don't like someone you can just say it. Despite all the listed good attributes that usually offset the bad ones (we all have them), I'm getting no sense of an actual like for her. \n\nI could be wrong, but I'm getting jealousy vibes too. Perhaps that he's willing to be considerate to her and cut his time with you and your friends short? Or that he's happy to indulge her? Or you have a crush on him, and that's fine as long as you're not trying to disrupt their relationship or do anything inappropriate. Unfortunately, this was inappropriate. \n\nYou overstepped. Stay out of other people's relationships. YTA.", "Info: how long have you been tired of being a third wheel or JUST feeling like one? Let the couple do couple like things", "YTA\n\n\nNothing you listed is controlling. At all. It's the sort of thing couples do for each other.\n\n\nHonestly you sound jealous. Apologise to your friend and butt out of his relationship. He's happy. She's happy. You're trying to create drama and issues in their relationship.", " I ask my partner to get stuff for me too. So i guess I'm team Jill.", "YTA. He puts his wife first  and it sounds like that really frosts your cookies \ud83c\udf6a.", "Yes, YTA. I'll bet Josh sees what he does as being a gentleman. You have no idea what happens within their marriage, nor should you.\n\nButt out. It's none of your business. If he's happy (and he clearly is), that's it.", "YTA, and big kudos to Josh for shutting you down and standing up for his wife in her absence. 100% these people have an actually lovely marriage that you are jealous of, whether you realize/admit it or not.", "Do you have a thing for Josh? I\u2019m not shaming you for it if you do! I just can\u2019t figure out from your post if you\u2019re with them in group settings mostly or if your the third wheel? \nIt sucks to feel like someone you care about is being wronged but unless he says he feels that way, you need to keep the opinions to yourself. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re an asshole since you made the comment and then dropped it.. but I think you may need to give them space.", "YTA. He's just taking care of his wife. I would do the same thing. You have no idea how she takes care of him in private but he seems to be more than happy with the trade-off lmao", "YTA - omg a man seeing another actually love his women and it\u2019s a problem", "My husband notices when my drink is low, if it looks like I forgot to grab something he knows I'd like he gets up and brings it to me (and so on and so on.) He just takes care of whatever, telling me not to get up, he's got it. I rarely need to ask for anything because he just does it. However, if I do actually ask him to grab me something or do something for me, he jumps up and does it right away and if I want to leave a place, for whatever reason, we leave. It makes him happy to make me happy, some people don't seem to get that aspect in our marriage and think I'm taking advantage or \"controlling him\" - trust me, if he doesn't like something he isn't shy about letting you know.", "YTA\n\nEveryone else said it. He loves her as she is, it\u2019s reciprocated - that\u2019s all that\u2019s needed in THEIR relationship.

However their relationship looks too you, it works for them. It sounds like his love language is acts of service; hers is probably something that suits him just as well as his works for her.", "YTA stop judging their relationship, not your business", "YTA It just looks like acts if service is his and/or her love language. Nothing says abuse here.", "You said Jill is controlling, but didn't describe any controlling behaviours? Look I had a girl friend who would always hand her bf her handbag or ask him to bring her stuff constantly. I thought it was an odd dynamic, but it's not controlling. It's just a not a dynamic that you'd maintain in your relationship. You're also only seeing a fraction of their relationship. When they go home Jill might be doing most of the sweet things for him.

None of your examples make Jill sound abusive which would be the only reason to have that kind of conversation. You still could be seeing something no one else sees and are just doing a poor job of explaining it, but based on what you\u2019ve shared, it just sounds like she\u2019s a bit used to getting taken care of and being able to ask Josh to do things for her. Maybe she\u2019s a little entitled. But that\u2019s Josh\u2019s choice - he has not complained about any of it, except maybe her music choices.

As the high-maintance wife let me tell you. When Josh doesn't feel like doing some menial task he totally says something, and you don't notice or hear about it because it's not your business. When we are at a party and I've asked my husband to grab me a drink 1 too many times he'll quietly let me know that he doesn't want to run around for me for a while and I thank him for being generous with his energy early in the night.

Her husband is talking about this woman as \"the love of his life\", he knew her before he knew OP, he is happy and not complaining, nor looking advice from OP. So OP is making his friend's happiness a problem, just because he wouldn't act this way in a relationship. Well I have news, not all relationships have to adhere to a type, everyone's happiness relies on different things, people are sometimes happy to do things that others would call a compromise/burden.

You owe your friend (and his wife) an apology", "YTA. Why are you trying to butt in?  He\u2019s happy with the relationship.  Maybe you should find friends outside of them.

You sound jealous and bitter. And if the rule is to pass around the aux and everyone gets a turn then don't complain about her music or change the rule. I'm failing to understand exactly what you have to complain about. It sounds like you have some cool friends who are happily married and you should be happy for them.

The morning of my last powerlifting competition, he drove there with me at 5 a.m. for weigh in, and then drove back to pick up my kids (not his) and drive them back. It's a 45 minute drive each way.

My best friend (M) will be Josh. His wife will be \nJill. We are all late 20s.\n\nJosh has been my best friend since senior year of college. He was already with Jill at that point. They've been married for years & were together for 6 years before. He is head over heels for her, very proud of her, always calling her the LOHL.\n\nI am good friends w/ Jill too & for the most part she's a lovely person - kind, caring, smart & generous, funny & tough. But there've always been some things about her that rub me wrong. She can come off as demanding & sometimes the way she says things seem barbed. She can make jokes that feel like they're a bit TOO far sometimes. She also leans into the image of being a 'dominant' person. Last, but probably the most annoying to me, is that she has no problem inconveniencing ppl to get what she wants. Especially Josh. He dotes on her & I just feel like sometimes she takes advantage. Examples: we'll all be comfortable in the hot tub at a party & she'll ask HIM to get up & get her a drink. She asks him to leave his own plate at a meal to grab her something she forgot. She often asks him to carry her purse eventually, on a day out & walking around. When we drive together we'll share the aux & she often picks songs that neither Josh nor I like at all & just laugh when we grimace, saying it's her turn so we can deal w/ it. If we're all out together, the night is over the SECOND Jill tells him she'd like to go home, whether or not the rest of us would like to stay out. \n\nI've never said anything to Josh, bc I didn't want to upset him or put my nose in. But a few nights ago, when we were at a party & he'd just brought her a THIRD beer & she'd gone outside with it to take out the host's dog, I pulled Josh aside & said something. Basically just said that I'm kinda worried about him, don't think it's right how Jill makes him wait on her, & asked him if he was really cool with being treated like a servant. He asked what I meant. I told him, I just felt like Jill was rude sometimes & sort of controlling w/ the things she asked for. Josh seemed surprised & sort of laughed it off, saying he was happy to do it & I didn't have to worry. I wasn't rly happy w/ his answer & it kind of made me MORE worried, but I let it go & the night went on.\n\nToday I got a text from Josh saying that he disliked the things I said about Jill, that he didn't appreciate me 'bashing her character', & that he was surprised at me. Then it said that Jill & he are partners, she treats him like gold & that he loves me alot but would prefer if I stayed out of their relationship business. \n\nI'm hurt & kind of pissed. When I talked about it w/ a couple mutual friends, they both said hands down I'm an asshole & that I need to get off Jill's case. But I think she could really stand to work on her manners. Josh is so nice that I worry she takes advantage & he just doesn't see it. I'm letting it go, and respecting his request. But was I really the AH?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I was expecting some red flags, subtle perhaps, but all I got is normal couple behaviour. By your own account Jill is an amazing person, you just don't like it that she sometimes asks her BF for favours or listens to music? None of it was even remotely problematic.

At home I dote on him, because I love him and I love doing things for him. No one is being forced to do anything for anyone.\n\nIs it your business? No. Did you insult your friend by assuming she's mistreating her spouse (who, as I'll remind you, he calls the love of his life)? Absolutely. You should apologize as soon as possible, and accept it if they decide not to keep you in their life. You kinda suck.\n\nAgain.

How they operate within their marriage has exactly nothing to do with you. Their dynamics are their business.

I\u2019m sat here having just eaten Korean bbq and rice that he just cooked for me from scratch. \n\nYou have no real insight into their private sphere and no entitlement to it either.

I do it because it\u2019s my way of taking care of our family and showing them how much I love them. My husband does these smaller things because he appreciates me.

Nothing her speak of abuse and you where out of line. \n\nJust another thing: did you ever though that maybe josh as some difficulties expressing himself or what he want and she has taken the role of stating it for both of them? \nI know so many couples who work like that because one of them is more shy. If he\u2019s so quick to react when she say she tired maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s too or they agreed before hand to go back home at that time. \n\nOne thing that show me your just jealous and not concerned about his well being is how you reacted when he defended her. If you where genuinely concerned about him you would have say something like \u00ab\u00a0sorry I just wanted to check on you because I was not sure.\u00a0\u00bb but no you where angry because you\u2019ve made a story in your head and what he say don\u2019t match it.", "YTA \n\nNothing you said is alarming relationship behavior.

And having been in the position where someone said I asked too much of my now husband because I would ask him to grab me a water from the kitchen when he was up already \u2014 it sucks. And it\u2019s something I\u2019ve never forgotten about. Because while this individual witnessed that and had the audacity to comment about it, they had no problem with me doing domestic work around the house \u2014 as that\u2019s my \u201cjob\u201d.", "YTA maybe your friend Josh has some kind of kink you're not privy too and Jill is accomadating...my point is no one, NO ONE, knows their dynamic other than them. \n\nYou just ruined your friendship. Was it worth it? Bc I bet Jill hates you now and Josh CLEARLY likes to keep HIS WIFE happy.", "It sounds like he just loves his wife and loves taking care of her. Doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s abusive or doesn\u2019t take care of him. You are trying to get in the middle of their relationship and you have no place there.

I havent put the bins out since he moved in. But i clean the bathrooms and do all the dusting. And tell him a love him a million times a day. Lol", "I'm going to add to this info request: why didn't you go to Jill?", "Damn straight", "I don't think that it's a secret anymore if it ever was.", "My husband asks me to make him a coffee almost everyday (claims mine tastes better) and I ask him to get me a dessert almost every evening (because I like the way he always gets me a little surprise like a piece of chocolate of whatnot)... Is this a mutually abusive relationship???\n\nYTA", "Truth. As my kids say \u201cdon\u2019t yuck someone\u2019s yum\u201d\ud83d\ude02 if he\u2019s happy let him be.", "Asking like she did and especially the point in time that she did- she is an ass in my opinion. Completly irrelevant if her concerns are valid or not, asking at a party, with other people around and the wife comming back at any time, is nearly the worst way possible. \n\n\nIf she asked at a privat phone call or meeting, I would've voted nta too.", "My guess was Love Of His Life.", "Took me a minute to figure out, but I think it means love of his life.", "I'm also gonna take this with a pinch of salt. Is he getting her a beer because he's like \" oh, your glass is empty, would you like another one?\" Or does she order him to? \n\nEither way, he's super happy with it, calls her the LOHL and enjoys his marriage as does she and its none of OPs business.", "What does high maintenance even mean? IMHO its generally applied to women who don't behave like doormats.", "That text message the next day, I bet it was after he talked it over with Jill. That\u2019s a boundary being drawn.", "I was onboard until your edit. What the hell is that sexist nonsense? If OP was a man, he just needs exposure to how relationships evolve but if OP is a woman she\u2019s cringy and desperate?", "Literally same here \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude02 my relationship dynamic is very similar. I sound just like Jill and my bf Josh \ud83d\ude02", "100%. My husband is usually the one who will do things like set up our camper trailer when we go camping, he\u2019s the one who will normally drive, fill up our car with petrol, carry stuff. But I give him a back massage (he had a quad biking accident when he was 25, 3 years ago) every night before bed, always get him a bottle of water when I notice he\u2019s finished his old one, I always cook dinner. Etc. people find their natural rhythms and sometimes one sides \u201cservices\u201d are more visible to the outside eye than the others, but it doesn\u2019t make hers less valid.", "OFT I dunno why I thought OP was a man and I was chalking this up to him being upset about his bro and homie love but OFT nah OP you are TOTALLY in love with him. \n\nYou sound like an annoying pick me.", "You\u2019d let someone disrespect your partner and shove their nose into your relationship \ud83d\ude2c", "Might be reading too much into it, but it\u2019s also not just that she chooses music she likes, regardless of other people\u2019s tastes, it was \u201cshe often picks songs neither Josh nor I like at all\u201d which is giving more of a subtle attempt at \u201clook how different she is than us\u201d vibes", "Right? Like obviously she\u2019s not incapable of doing these things herself but if he genuinely wants to do it and doesn\u2019t mind then what\u2019s the harm? \n\nNobody knows what their relationship is like except for them.", "My husband asks me at LEAST three times a day to make him coffee. I only have to press a button but I feel like a secretary. It's however how he feels loved, small acts of service make him appreciated. \n\nOPs friend doesn't seem to mind and that's where it should end.", "Good one. :P", "The poster is a woman", "I agree with you and that\u2019s why I said she could\u2019ve handled it better. Having concerns for someone is a good thing. That\u2019s why she\u2019s NTA in my opinion. Some times people are in abusive relationships and they are totally unaware of this. We do not know that information and that is why I find value in her concern.", "Some people also enjoy doing little acts of service for the person they love. My boyfriend likes recharging my phone credit. I thought it would inconvience him when I send him a message everytime I used up my credit, but he likes doing it and says it makes him feel 'useful'.\n\nNothing what OP describes sounds abusive to me.", "Even if she orders him to, if he doesn't mind I wouldn't say anything. If he came to me and said, \"I hate how she's always ordering me around! If I don't do what she wants, she throws a fit!\" THEN I'd say something. But everything the OP mentions doesn't seem even that demanding and Josh isn't complaining. He should've just kept his mouth shut. YTA", "Not to mention things to take into consideration like their personal love language. Is it a kink of theirs for him to take care of her? Honestly a lot of this sounds normal to me. My partners love language is Acts of service and I know this so I often do things like make his plate and refill his drink for him, because I know it's little ways to show I care that don't matter to me but make him feel cared for - he does it for me as well if I ask or he notices I need it, just less often because it doesnt mean as much to me. In return he knows mine is touch and words of affirmation. He doesn't leave without giving me a kiss and telling me he loves me. He touches me every time he walks past me. Because he knows it comforts me. If either of us is ready to leave somewhere - most of the time - even if the other isn't ready we leave, because we came together and it's not fair to make one person uncomfortable just because the other person is having fun. There are rare exceptions but, it's at our own decision - not 'oh just suck it up'.", "I know OP insists her friendship with Josh is platonic, but her attitude and actions don't show someone concerned for a friend's welfare, they show old-fashioned jealousy of his wife.", "In general,  high maintenance = has any standards. I was called high maintenance for expecting my partners to put in a much effort as they expected of me.", "She\u2019s probably \u201cabrasive\u201d because she gives her actual opinion.", "I agree. I don't think OP is going to be invited around much at all anymore.\n\nIf I was Josh and Jill, I wouldn't.\n\nOP might be about to find out that Jill is Josh's best friend, not her.", "Yes, because that generally changes the motivation in straight dynamics.", "Same same same! My husband enjoys doing these sorts of things for me. Makes him feel useful and needed. When he doesn\u2019t want to he tells me. And I care for him in different but equally supportive ways.", "  \nOP do you also pull aside your female friends who do everything for their bf/husband to express concern that they're being controlled? I bet not....  \n\n\nLike the above commenters, literally every relationship I've been in the guy has these little things for me. I know the social conditioning prevalent in society still is for the woman to mother the useless husband but I personally always like to be the more pampered one and guys just do this naturally because they like to (or I don't date them haha).  \n\n\nYTA", "Wait. OP is a woman? Holy crap this entire story is so different to me now I \u2014 wow. That\u2019s so embarrassing for OP I\u2019m dead \ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80", "What's disrespectful about it? My partner is not beyond reproach.", "Yes, the \"I know him better than his wife\" language is very clear in this one.", "Oh, I'm sorry. I edited my comment.", "Acts of service may absolutely be a love language spoken in OP's friend's situation like it is in yours. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nMy husband does a LOT of things to take care of me, big and small. He WANTS to, because he's the type that needs to take care of someone. This works out well because I am chronically ill and have a decent amount of care needs. In return, I take care of him in other ways. It doesn't have to be equal in all ways. What matters is if everyone's needs are being met.", "And if Jill has noticed that this is the case for Josh, she actually keeps him very happy when she asks for his help. Or they could be in a sub-Dom relationship, and this is how they can act around friends. Who cares anyway, Josh seems happy and so does Jill.", "Oh for sure. After being together that long, and the way he talks about her. I can almost guarantee that they are. Op is probably about to be in for a rude awakening.", "RIGHT IM SO EMBARRASSED FOR HER\n\nLike I\u2019m cringing", "How about this though your husband's close female friend complains to him about you says you treat him badly and he should see it.\n\nDo you think there COULD be an altermotive especially when the things their complaining about are garbage like this?", "I'm in the same situation. My husband is just a caring person in general and making me happy is what makes him happy. He'll even beat himself up if a meal doesn't turn out right or he forgets to do something for me, which I'm trying to help him let go of. I appreciate everything he does, but I don't expect it and half the time the meal he believes is ruined is still delicious, just not in the way he planned.\n\nI'm pretty high maintenance with physical tasks due to my illnesses, but I'm low maintenance in most other aspects. We match each other really well and enjoy most of the same things so we just chill 90% of our downtime. He feels loved with affection and quality time, so we spend lots of time snuggling and playing games together etc. I feel like a burden sometimes because his needs feel so easy for me to meet compared to mine, but he constantly reassures me he's happy and thinks he gets the better deal.\n\nWe often joke the best relationships are the ones where you both think the other is out of your league!", "My first thought was that Jill might have an invisible disability.  I've got an autoimmune disorder and I don't *look* sick, but getting up and down or carrying things for a while is difficult, and gatherings with friends are all exhausting and I always have to leave early.  OP basically described my relationship with my husband.", "I was absolutely thinking D/s relationship.  And OP - YTA", "Sure, there could. And if my husband's close friend, of any gender, continued to push the issue after he told them to drop it, then there's a problem.\n\nBut once? In relative private? Nah, that's perfectly okay.\n\nMy spouse is bisexual: should I worry that all of their friends might be trying to get into their pants?", "Your relationship sounds lovely. \u2764\ufe0f So very similar to mine.\n\nI'm glad you have who you need.", "No, just all their friends that are attract to men and feel the need to disparage you for nothing.\n\nAnd it isn't saying that is even for sure the case with OP I'm just saying it's a bad color", "If it's a one-off thing, I'm not going to get bothered about it. Heck, maybe I AM doing something wrong, thst someone outside the dynamic has spotted, and I need to correct course.\n\nIf it becomes a regular thing, then yeah, there might be a problem."]}
