Each person is responsible for paying their own way, so if she really wants to go, she can buy the $800 ticket.  \n\n\nFrom what I'm reading OP doesn't have hundreds of dollars to throw around casually. The only reason he's even going to the festival is because he got them for free. It's a little concerning that the GF does not want OP to go without her to the concert. In a healthy relationship, one should be ok with their partner having fun without them.", "This response doesn't make any sense, and makes me feel like you didn't read the original post in its entirety. Yes I have a boyfriend and I love him very much... and if his friend gifted him a free ticket to a music festival, and it was him and his friends all excited to have this great experience together, why in the world would I make that about me...? Why would I start a fight about it? I would be happy he got a free ticket and I'd be happy for him that he could have a good time with his friends. Do you think it is appropriate to invite yourself when you were not invited and then expect everyone in the group to pay for you? Why would I be uncomfortable with my boyfriend going to a concert with his friends without me? That is toxic and controlling. We will see each other later and I'll enjoy hearing all about his great time!", "How about dating just for the person? And the moment? Now I gotta choose to either commit the rest of my life to them or not commit at all? I DON'T KNOW if I'm ready for marriage, much less with my current partner, THIS IS WHY I'M DATING.

If he won a ticket to a festival he wanted to go to, I would send him on his way. Even if I might have liked to go. Especially if the cost of a single ticket is $800. Sorry, but committed couples who have budgets and adult things to pay for like rent, utilities, insurance, cars, groceries, etc don't just drop $800 at a moments notice. Adult couples also do things independently of each other and don't say If I can't go, you can't go. And that is what OPs GF is trying to do. NTA.", "Exactly. I do wish she would come. We both wished to attend, but couldn't because of finances. Now I have the opportunity to do it for free.

You just got very lucky, and for her, either she pays, or she dont go. She should let you go with your friends and you will go together later", "Maybe I'm old school. I like to be able to provide for my woman. That's why I didn't seriously start dating until after I worked on myself and became the successful man I am today.", "Oh he's not obligated. I just think he's a poor excuse of a man. You can thank the feminists for that behavior in men today though.", "If it's truly about her being controlling and insecure I agree. But if she wanted to share this experience with him, then it's obvious he's ok with ditching her if she can't provide for herself. That's just not a partnership for me. That's more like friend with benefits so why call her your GF?", "Dating for the moment is shallow and fucked up if you're leading someone on. Everything else you said I agree with. You HAVE to date in order to find out about a person but as soon as you see yourself not being able to marry the person back out. What I'm saying is your GF found out about you. If I were her I'd be wondering if in 10 years if you make more than her, would you still go on vacation with your boys because she can't afford her portion.", "It sounds like you're not that into music festivals. That's why I think it's hard for you to relate. Imagine if instead of a festival it was your favorite vacation destination and you and your husband had separate finances, he made more and wouldn't help you out because you couldn't afford it.

The two of you are a couple, you both wanted to do something, you get the chance to do it for free, but you're not willing to try to help your GF get there.  \"I would do anything if I had the money.\"  Anything except consider your GF's feelings here.", "Just remember that because YTA (imo at least) doesn\u2019t mean your gf won\u2019t be hurt. I hope you guys can come to an agreement, maybe start planing something for the two of you.", "Except within that 800 bill is transport, accommodation, and  food (as you listed) which I assume the rest of you are needing to pay too so how much is the ticket by itself?", "None of this is about \"providing for your woman\". Which is what the comment you responded to laid out, so it still seems like you're disregarding the main aspect. This is about her inviting herself all because she basically wanted to chaperone her boyfriend, and then expected everyone to pay for her to do so. And on top of that created a fight and negativity instead of just being happy for her man and this awesome opportunity.", "Is it hard work wearing that heavy medal all day?", "I would say the opposite\u2026the poor excuse of a man is the one who has such little backbone that he can\u2019t do anything without his partner lol", "So what am I supposed to do? Skip the chance of going just because she feels bad? Give the ticket to her so she can go instead of me? Putting myself on the second place in favor of my partner in such situations is what will lead to unhappiness in relationship. If I don't go she will feel guilty, if I do she will feel left out, what am I supposed to do? Again, if I had the money I would pay the price.", "Why is OP obligated to help his GF with paying for the ticket? If they were both going, she would have paid her own way. Now because her bf was invited to go with some friends, he has to pay for half her tickets? In a healthy relationship, people should be able to have fun with their friends without the partner being around.", "If that's truly what it is I agree with you. I saw it as something she would also like to participate in because she enjoys music festivals.", "Are we advocating for men to do anything they want in a relationship without regard for their partners feelings?", "When did I say that? I said men need to have a backbone. If I want to go on a boys trip to the mountains, and my GF wants to go as well, are my options now either cancel the trip, or bring my GF around?", "Why can't you have a boys night or afternoon? Why would you exclude your girl from a trip she could make good memories with you because the BOYS can't handle having a female around?", "Weigh the relationship. You don\u2019t have to pay a cent for her. However you are her boyfriend and will have to put up with her attitude. Weigh it out and decide.

She shoul let you go to the festival without her instead of trying to get you to pay.", "NTA.\n\nI mean I would have paid a little to help someone I was really in love with because I'd naturally want them to share the experience, but it sounds like y'alls intimacy hasn't matured into that yet. If it had, she wouldn't mind if you went and had a great time either.", "NTA, but it sounds like you don't like your girlfriend very much. If I scored free tickets to something my partner wanted to go to, I would definitely pay half so they could join me and reap half the windfall. But that doesn't make you an asshole.", "NTA sounds like a bros night she invited herself so should pay for herself.", "He clearly can't afford even the $400 and is only going because its free. Why can't she just let him go and be happy?", "Lol why in the world would a boyfriend be on the hook for any costs at all?", "We found the gf", "I didn't say he was on the hook, which implies responsibility.  I said that as her BF, I'd think he would be willing to help out with the costs.  Willing to help out - not on the hook.  People look at strict letter of the law here, and life doesn't work that way.", "Lol what? You have some really strange ideas about women. We're not all dating to marry.", "I didn't say pay the whole price - or even pay half.  People seem to have critical reading skill issues today.  You can't afford anything - not a single bit - towards helping her out with this?", "They weren't both going.  He was fairly clear about that.  I didn't say pay for half - I said help her out.  \n\nYou have a good point about healthy relationships and people being able to have fun without their partner being around.  But this isn't about heading out for a few drinks with the guys.  This is a music festival that appears to be over a few days that the GF would very much want to attend.", "NTA.

You could not afford to pay for your own ticket, so you cannot afford to pay for hers.", "NTA. So she invited herself, bought a ticket and then expects others to pay for her to go.
