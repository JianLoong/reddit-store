We have double income no kids. Our house has a pool in the yard, it's really nice since it does get quite hot during summers. Our nabour 32F is a single mom of three, her house doesn't have a pool and it's a lot smaller than ours. Both me and my husband babysit for her sometimes which is why I know this.\nYesterday morning when my husband had already left for work and I had started to work from home, I heard noises form our yard (our houses in here aren't right next to each other so it's quite easy to tell that the noise is from your yard). So I went to check and our nabour and her kids were swimming in our pool. I was confused since she has never came to our house uninvited. But I went to talk to her and asked what was going on. She explained that she had a day off from work so she wanted to do something nice with her kids so she decided to \"borrow\" our pool since we don't have much use for it since we are child free. I asked her nicely to leave since they had come uninvited and were there without our premission. She tought I was joking but when I asked again she got defensive and demanded that I should give her valid reasoning why she and her kids can't be there. I didn't give her reasonings but I told her that I would call the police if she didn't leave and told her not to show up uninvited again. She did leave but kept cursing at me. And even accused me of classisim. \nI think it's important to mention that because we live in a area were the houses aren't right next to each other and you can't see inside our house even for the furthest point of our yard. So me and my husband tend to hangout just in underwear or sometimes naked. So I was shocked to find her there just using our pool so confortably. \nMy nabour has been mad to me since and she has bad mouthed me to others in the nobourhood. I told my husband and my parents about this. My husband and my dad think what I did was reasonable but my mom told me  that I should have been more understanding to her since she works hard and is a single mom of three. But I feel like she didn't care about our privacy at all.

Stop babysitting for her altogether.", "NTA. You don't need to justify to anyone why you don't want uninvited people swimming in your pool.

It\u2019s a MASSIVE liability to have people just using your pool unsupervised and sometimes insurance can get out of paying in situations like these. I know this because my parents had a pool when I was young, and one summer we were away for most of it, and my dad asked our insurance agent if the neighbours could use the pool while we were gone and he was told that we wouldn\u2019t be covered for liability in that situation.\n\nMake sure your yard is fenced and locked up from now on.", "NTA.  You said you didn't have a reason at the time to give your neighbour but just know that in a lot of places (not sure where you are located) if something happens like a child drowning in your pool, you are 100% liable (at fault).\n\nI would lock off the area and put up a sign stating that trespassers are not welcome and/or there is no lifeguard on duty.\n\nShe is being entitled.  You do not owe your situation (having a pool and no children) to her.", "NTA.   One, it\u2019s rude to just use someone\u2019s pool without asking.  Two, she\u2019s rude for assuming you and your husband have no use for the pool since you\u2019re child free.  Three, you will be liable if anything happens to any one of them while they are in your pool.   Put up a gate with a lock around the pool so it they would physically have to break into it and hang no trespassing signs. Four, that is a serious invasion of privacy.", "NTA and if you had let her swim that day, she will keep showing up or even invite the neighbors! Also she could sue you if someone got hurt.", "NTA -I have a pool.  I have no kids.  It has a fence around it for a reason.  Under no circumstances would I allow anyone to use my pool without asking me to.  \n\nThe liability alone of a child (or adult) drowning while using my pool far outweighs anything.  \n\nYour neighbor was flat wrong and you should hold your ground.  You literally could lose everything over this.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s not a public pool. She was trespassing and putting you in a position where, if an accident happened, you could be held liable. I wonder how often she\u2019s brought her kids over before without telling you?", "Honestly, your mother is weird saying you should've let your neighbour and her kids swim in your pool. It's not appropriate to go into someone's garden/swimming pool without asking for permission. It's trespassing.\nYour neighbour is wrong for trespassing and for cussing at you.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\u2014 it is unacceptable for her to just come over and use your pool without permission. Also\u2014 you should be concerned about any people using your pool. If someone drowns, you will be responsible. Get a security system. Also, report this to the police so there is a record of trespassing or breaking in. That way you have some defense against a lawsuit if she does it again and a tragedy happens.", "I would have been on the fence if she had asked and you said no, BUT she has the audacity to show up and hop on in. Absolutely NTA. If she had asked and you said yes, I'm sure you would have laid out some expectations as well as times that worked for you, but this is ridiculous.", "NTA. \n\nLike what if you had just done a heavy amount of chemical addition to clean the pool and it wasn\u2019t safe to swim?", "Op you are absolutely right they are no-bour not neighbours.\n\nStand your ground and talk with law enforcers about this incident and place a no trespass order against them.\n\nAnd stop babysitting for her", "NTA. You could be held responsible if they get injured or drown when they're in the pool. Also, the neighbor has shown the kids how they can get in and they could end up sneaking in without an adult. Get a lock for the gate or get a pool cover and cover the pool when not in use. It will take a bit of work for the neighbor and/or her children to get the cover rolled up versus running over and jumping right in.", "NTA.  Here\u2019s a valid reason for her:  it\u2019s not her house or pool", "'Valid reason' . You don't need what she classes as a valid reason. You just say \"I don't need to give you a reason, I don't want you on my property, using our things, uninvited\" Also, swimming pools aren't just for kids, so the no kids comment is rubbish that you have no use for it.", "NTA. Borrowing requires consent, the neighbour didn\u2019t \u201cborrow\u201d anything, she took the opportunity when she thought OP wasn\u2019t home to use their pool. She likely has done this before (based on her entitled behaviour). \n\nOP shouldn\u2019t have to defend themselves, but has no requirement to be \u2018understanding\u2019 to someone who steals from you. Because that is what she did.", "Totally NTA. \n\nFirst, that's trespassing. They weren't invited, and you could have them arrested.\n\nSecond, liability issues. IF, God forbid, someone got hurt or drowned, you can be sued. You can lose everything!!! That she's so self-centered not to consider that is stupid on her part.\n\nThird, document this and consider cameras. If it happened once I guarantee there will be a second incident.", "NTA. It's your property, not a public pool. On a more serious note, if she or her kids hurt themselves on your property (slips and falls happen around pools) she would no doubt hold you liable. It's not worth the risk from your point of view.", "NTA.\n\nNo one of sound mind just walks into someone else's property and uses the pool.\n\nThat. Is. Insane.\n\nGood for you for sticking up for yourself and not even getting into words of argument. You don't have to justify your reasoning.\n\nI imagine though she thought you were out working which is why she didn't bother to ask like common decency dictates.\n\nMaybe get a camera so she doesn't try this again.", "Get cameras, get no trespassing signs, buy an alarm that goes in your pool too incase the kids get past everything else.  Is your pool not fenced off?  And, I\u2019d seriously consider having an attorney send her a letter.  It only takes about 30 seconds for a child to drown.  She is way out of line.", "I have heard this before so not sure if it is real but\u2026 assuming it is\u2026. You were right. Naked time or not, it is a liability, disruptive and not her property. Careful about babysitting\u2026 it is very strange that anyone would be so entitled, self important and brazen. A distancing is absolutely called for\u2026 and cameras", "NTA. She\u2019s an entitled single mother", "NTA. You were completely reasonable. Don't go on to others property without permission.", "NTA\n\nI'd bet money this isn't the first time they've done it. It's just the first time they've been caught.", "NTA not only should it be obvious that she can\u2019t just go your place and use your stuff but the fact that she is literally telling you that she can just walk into  your pool and that you don\u2019t have a use of it anyways because you don\u2019t have kids is almost unbelievable", "I\u2019m sick and tired of other people being expected to cater to single parents.  Their actions aren\u2019t my consequences and they\u2019re not entitled to anything of mine unless I choose to share it.  You already watch her kids - she should appreciate that and not go out of her way to lay claim to your property.", "NTA. I have a pool and my kids are grown. I\u2019d be BULLSHIT if someone was in my pool without an invite. Her choices are her choices and her situation is her situation. She does not get to be entitled and use some thing because she think she deserves it.", "NTA. Your yard, your pool. If one of them gets injured or drowns, your getting sued.", "Your pool, your home, your legal liability.", "NTA, your nabour and mom are whack", "NTA. Even if you had invited her every day for a year, she is not entitled to your space without an invitation. Very weird. You can clear your name with the neighbors just by letting them know she came uninvited.", "That is next level entitlement.. stay away from this one.. no more babysitting.. she will eat you alive", "NTA If something should happen to one of them while using the pool, you could be held liable. And to do so without being invited is extremely rude.", "NTA. Liability is huge. You may need to make sure you have met all local requirements for having a pool, including safety fencing. No one should be able to get into your pool w/o your knowledge, esp when you are home.", "NTA - she literally trespassed on your property, violating your privacy as you said and also putting you in a risky position due to the liability of her kids in your pool. She\u2019s not entitled to your pool just because she\u2019s a mom, tf? If she rlly wanted to take her kids swimming she could\u2019ve looked for a local lake or pool, or even approached you to ask if she could use yours considering you babysit her kids sometimes. You would still be under no obligation to say yes though.", "Your neighbor is asshole. Not you do just let her kids use with out talking to you..If they drowned she be first to sue you I ll bet!! I don t understand how she thinks it s ok to do that. Maybe she thought no one was home so she could??", "NTA.... if anyone got hurt you would be liable", ">I don't speak English as my first language\n\nTotally acceptable! You will see people freaking out on here about it, because it\u2019s amazing how few native speakers can spell and wouldn\u2019t be that shocking if this had been a native speaker post. Just ignore it.\n\nAlso, NTA. Is it classism if my rich neighbor doesn\u2019t let me walk in and use his high-end kitchen? She just didn\u2019t want to ask first and be told no.. then was embarrassed for getting called out and tried to blame you. Isn\u2019t it great that immature adults like this are raising three kids?\n\nAlso, people rent out their pools now: https://www.swimply.com/ so if she wants to use it in the fire send her that link and charge her for it.", "NTA - she is creating a liability for you. In the US at least, you can be sued if someone gets hurt on your property. If someone drowns in your pool when you didn\u2019t even know they were there, you can be sued for not fencing it.", "NTA it's your property, private property, and she just shows up. I can't even begin to think about the mental gymnastics she had to do to say this is fine. Regardless of if she had been round before this is just plane trespassing. She could have asked in advance, called or ask permission and the only reason why she kicked off was to play the victim role. \n\nIf anything would have happened to her kids as well you bet she would have been telling every man and his dog your home wasn't safe, it's all your fault and you would still be the bad guy.", "Not the asshole. She is teaching her kids it\u2019s ok to come to your pool anytime. So next it would be her kids alone. And then a kid who drowns. \n\nIf in the USA a pool is an attractive nuisance so even though they came uninvited you are held liable if someone is hurt or dies.", "omg NTA - I wish i could address everything like u did this.
