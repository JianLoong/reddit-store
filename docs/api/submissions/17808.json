Aaron has been a skinny kid his whole life, and he had even talked about how insecure he was about it in the past. Well, Gwen started taking Aaron to the gym after they started dating, and I gotta admit Aaron's made noticeable progress since, being pretty lean at this point. From what Aaron told me, Gwen apparently has them going six days a week and following a regimented nutrition diet. \n\nWell, we got catering from papa johns yesterday, and most of us were eating pizza, wings, and cookie cake. I say most of us cuz Aaron and Gwen didn't have any. Gwen mentioned that she and Aaron had already eaten prior to the gathering. Aaron sighed to Gwen that he wanted to just pig out for the night and have some pizza at least, saying he's been strict enough recently and that he's back with his friends again after finishing up the school year. Gwen smiled and told Aaron that they had to stick to their routine and not cheat, and said some blabber about commitment and consistency. I want to mention I've genuinely had no issue with Gwen up until now, but hearing this had me concerned. The rest of the group and I kinda looked at each other with awkward looks. \n\nI decided to pitch in and say, \"Look, you both are really committed, and it definitely shows! But if Aaron's been this regimented enough, I say he deserves a break. And some pizza.\" Gwen honestly looked taken aback, and asked me to please not interfere with Aaron's progress, though she thanked me for the compliment. I responded that I wasn't trying to interfere, and that this looked like it was way too strict and detrimenting. Gwen literally had the audacity to say, \"Okay kid, you got no clue what you're talking about. And if you're gonna talk to me like that, I'm not gonna stay in your household.\" I honestly couldn't even say anything as I was in too much shock, and Gwen stormed out, dragging a shocked Aaron with her. \n\nWell, Aaron texted me this morning, saying that Gwen was PISSED with me and that she wanted an apology. I haven't responded, and I texted our other friends about this whole thing, telling them not to tell Aaron. They were in just as much shock as me, and said I don't owe Gwen an apology.

(Also super weird to have people call this an eating disorder, as though the occasional night of pizza, wings *and* cookie cake is just a normal thing that all healthy people do.)\n\nDoes she have any real idea what the day to day in this relationship looks like?  Perhaps her friend has confessed serious body insecurities to his GF, and has *asked* that she really help him stay on track.  Be the willpower he struggles to have.  Perhaps he has had other \"cheat\" days.  I know bodybuilders are very very specific about when they can and can't cheat.  Like if that is HIS goal, then yeah - perhaps that night could just not be a pizza and wings and cookie cake kind of night.\n\nOr maybe not.  Maybe his GF is indeed very controlling.\n\nThe point being - OP really does not know.  If she has concerns about her friend being in a potentially controlling relationship, then she should discuss it with him privately later.  But jumping into a couples' argument, as though she has the best understanding of what is going on between them, was inappropriate."]}
