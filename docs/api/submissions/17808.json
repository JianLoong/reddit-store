Aaron and Gwen have been dating for over a year now, and I should also mention now that Gwen was apparently really athletic in high school and even did some powerlifting in college. Aaron has been a skinny kid his whole life, and he had even talked about how insecure he was about it in the past. Well, Gwen started taking Aaron to the gym after they started dating, and I gotta admit Aaron's made noticeable progress since, being pretty lean at this point. From what Aaron told me, Gwen apparently has them going six days a week and following a regimented nutrition diet. \n\nWell, we got catering from papa johns yesterday, and most of us were eating pizza, wings, and cookie cake. I say most of us cuz Aaron and Gwen didn't have any. Gwen mentioned that she and Aaron had already eaten prior to the gathering. Aaron sighed to Gwen that he wanted to just pig out for the night and have some pizza at least, saying he's been strict enough recently and that he's back with his friends again after finishing up the school year. Gwen smiled and told Aaron that they had to stick to their routine and not cheat, and said some blabber about commitment and consistency. I want to mention I've genuinely had no issue with Gwen up until now, but hearing this had me concerned. The rest of the group and I kinda looked at each other with awkward looks. \n\nI decided to pitch in and say, \"Look, you both are really committed, and it definitely shows! But if Aaron's been this regimented enough, I say he deserves a break. And some pizza.\" Gwen honestly looked taken aback, and asked me to please not interfere with Aaron's progress, though she thanked me for the compliment. I responded that I wasn't trying to interfere, and that this looked like it was way too strict and detrimenting. Gwen literally had the audacity to say, \"Okay kid, you got no clue what you're talking about. And if you're gonna talk to me like that, I'm not gonna stay in your household.\" I honestly couldn't even say anything as I was in too much shock, and Gwen stormed out, dragging a shocked Aaron with her. \n\nWell, Aaron texted me this morning, saying that Gwen was PISSED with me and that she wanted an apology. I haven't responded, and I texted our other friends about this whole thing, telling them not to tell Aaron. They were in just as much shock as me, and said I don't owe Gwen an apology. But Aaron literally texted me two more times practically hounding me. What do I do?

NTA but he might just be struggling to stay on the diet, and asked her to keep it strict. You shouldn\u2019t say he should have some pizza, and she shouldn\u2019t have said he can\u2019t. He should\u2019ve decided for himself, unless he asked her to keep his diet strict.", "She sounds like a drag and a control freak. NTA.", "Maybe, but Gwen definitely is! I personally don't think you are the AH but I do recognize that some people may think you overstepped. If you did I would think it would be Aaron who deserves an apology since it was his business being discussed for the majority of the time. Definitely not to Gwen.", "NTA. Poor Aaron. He's go no backbone and lets his girlfriend control him. The gym isn't going to give him the kind of strength he needs. You just stood up for a friend who either can't or won't stick up for himself.", "ESH. Not for Gwen to decide what Aaron eats, let alone dictate this in front of his friends. That is unless he had asked her to be his food police. Not your place to decide that Aaron's diet is \"too strict.\" Aaron's an adult. Sounds like you and Gwen were talking about Aaron's diet as though he weren't there. Not respectful to him as an adult. Aaron's the one who needs an apology, from you and Gwen.", "NTA. ONLY AARON gets to say what Aaron will and won't eat. Gwen is being a bully. It's not like his health is in danger here such that she needs to step in. \n\nHonestly the whole fight was inappropriate, since it was between two people who should have no say over what Aaron eats. \n\nAs for the apology, I think you want to talk to Aaron. If his management of his relationship requires that you apologize to Gwen in order for him to stay friends with you, you might need to do it. But I'm saying talk to him rather than text him, so you can express your concern about him being too controlled by her. (That's not something you want put in a text where she might read it.)", "INFO\n\n> I decided to pitch in and say\n\nThat was a mistake. Everyone else gave each other awkward looks because that's how you're supposed to handle a couple being awkward in public. Getting between them in their argument is a huge social faux pas and a direct challenge to Gwen, especially in front of everyone.

Her demanding an apology is delusional. NTA", "Ahhh, the couple's eating disorder. What a way to bond.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  Gwen is definitely the guiding light towards the misery of that relationship.  You did nothing wrong and don't owe her an apology.  Aaron is clearly the submissive and doesn't realize that his behavior is only going to more misery.", "NTA I would apologize for your friend's sake. But she is definitely strict.", "Tricky one but I'm going to go with yta. Your friend can make his own choices and if that means listening to his girlfriend even though he doesn't want to that's on him. That being said I probably would have said something too so I can't judge you too harshly.", "YTA. You spoke on his behalf. If you have concerns, you talk to him.

That is literally the basis for any plan to lose weight or implement healthy habits.", "NTA...kinda weird that Aaron sits there and lets her control him. He said he wanted pizza, he's an adult, he shouldn't have to ask. This relationship is concerning", "NTA but dont bother standing up for him anymore.", "YTA, stay out of it if you want to keep up your friendship with Aaron. You really might not know what your talking about. \n\nWhen you go on a diet it really helps to have someone who cares about you and your progress to keep you honest. And its easier to have someone else say \u201cno\u201d to the pizza then to have the will power to say that to yourself. And it\u2019s not just about slipping one time once your body is no longer acoustomed to greasy foods having some can do a number on your stomach.", "YTA. You have no insight into his fitness journey. Of course he wants to pig out, everyone doing what they\u2019re doing wants to pig out. You were way out of line injecting yourself into what doesn\u2019t even sound like an argument. He\u2019s not your child you don\u2019t need to be his voice.", "Yta - it's none of your business. Pigging out isn't healthy. The food you ordered isn't healthy. It's not your place to hop into a discussion between the two of them about their goals.", "ESH Gwen is being way too controlling, Aaron is not standing up for himself (he's a grown man who can eat a piece of pizza if that's what he really wants to do) and you involved yourself in something between the two of them, in front of everyone else.  You could have stayed quiet and left it between them, or privately talked to Aaron about it and shared your concerns.", "YTA.", "NTA, but I'd apologize anyway so she doesn't try to cut you out of his life.

Just saying \"you're right, thanks for keeping me accountable\" or whatever from him would have literally made this a non-issue. Neither of them did, and he's still asking OP to apologize so that seems very unlikely.", "Yeah, and if op is worrying about Gwen being too controlling (and it's sounding like she is very very controlling), this probably isn't the time to bring it up. If op had just kept it to the first comment, it probably would have been ok, but this wasn't actually the way to deal with the issue. Op's heart is in the right place, and this attitude to dieting sounds unhealthy, but this wasn't the way to address that.", "Stopping your friend from having an ED is an appropriate time to step in. And this is what this was. Calorie counting, strict workout and dieting, no cheat days? All signs of early ED. He said he WANTED to have some, and she told him no. She told OP no, not once did he say he didn\u2019t want any. And the fact that he\u2019s begging OP to apologize shows she\u2019s probably abusing him, most likely mentally.", "Really well said!", "I agree with this.

Nobody should be treated like that.", "\"Ok kid\" NTA  and frankly people who talk like chidrens anime cool guys are just exhausting", "ESH\n\nGwen and Aaron suck for attending your social gathering and bringing conflict to the meal with their little personal debate over whether Aaron can indulge or not.  Aaron particularly sucks with his little dramatic sighing over the pizza in the first place because dollars to donuts he knew he would kick Gwen off and exactly how she would respond.  Both Gwen and Aaron knew that they would not be eating the moment they knew what was being served. Their job at that point was to support the social gathering to the best of their ability and in the most polite way possible while declining the food on offer as others were eating.\n\nYou suck because you should not have gotten into the middle of this little bit of performative art that those two were putting on that highlight their lifestyle. \n\nGwen and Aaron particularly suck for having the audacity to drag this on even further by demanding an apology.

He wanted pizza and Gwen spoke to him like he's a kid in front of his friends. Idc how long people have been together, bodily autonomy is an individual right and he should be able to have a slice with friends if he wants to.
