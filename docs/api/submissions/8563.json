You could well find that in years to come they have a claim to the land. (The courts might take the view that you abandoned it.) Also, what will you do if they never build a fence on the boundary? They\u2019ve effectively gained a one-foot wide stretch of land. You might also have trouble accessing it without going via their property and of course they would probably be within their rights to trespass to you.

This way the fence remains entirely on your property while giving up minimal space to the neighbor. That also means that they can't do anything to their side of the fence (like painting or hanging anything decorative) because it would be entirely on your side of the property line instead of straight down the middle and to reach it they would technically be trespassing and would need your permission to even touch it. This may seem petty, but if they don't want to help you cover the cost of something they are actively utilizing too, then there is no reason for them to have the privilege of using the fence for anything other than a separation of your property and theirs. As for their point of view, it could be something from they currently don't have the finances for it since they live paycheck to paycheck all the way to you're the one that wants to replace the fence so they just get a free fence out of it and get to keep the money to use on a vacation or something that could be considered lavish like a new tv (which is where I'd get petty as hell).", "I don't really understand why you can't just put your fence exactly on your side of the property line.

And like I said, I\u2019m petty as hell.", "[removed]", "Yeah, but they don't need to out on a fence themselves because you've already provided them with one, even if it is a foot into your property. I don't see what you're accomplishing here? You had the option of putting a fence on the property line, and you had the second option of putting the fence a foot into your property. So you went with the second option that gave them a fence anyway, plus it cost you a foot of property? Make this make sense.

From your post, it doesn\u2019t sound like their tone was rude, or that they were mean, perhaps when you asked initially they thought it would be required.

They were never the nicest people to us as we tried to address the issue that they would let their 8 dogs outside in their back garden, constantly barking for hours. So when I saved the money to replace the fence, I  waited until they went on vacation and replaced the wood fencing with concrete fencing slats. (It was actually cheaper than wood).

The original fence was only 1.5ft high and her little dog used to come into my yard and attack my big dog. Neighbour also used to watch us all the time, from both ground level and her 1st floor windows, and eventually started sitting in our yard to knit under a big tree 'because the shade was better there' and that 'the previous neighbour never minded'. She stalled me for 18mths on the fence issue before I contacted the local council who recommended in writing that 1) she needed to pay half, and that 2) if she wanted to keep that portion of land, she needed to pay the however-many-tens-of-thousand-dollars to buy it off me.

In both we're required to allow our neighbors to tie in. \n\nIn this house, we built first and our neighbor on one side tied in. If the fence needed to be replaced, then I would replace it. In our old house, we had 6 different fences, but when there was an issue to repair or replace, the owner did it. We made the decision in our old house that we weren't comfortable nailing into their fence, so we put up posts right at the property line and basically butted up to the fence instead. We had a few boards crossing the property line but those could be removed if anyone ever had an issue. When our neighbor on one side had to replace their large section, we couldn't have afforded to contribute at that moment and I would have expected input into the what was being built.

If you want money for the fence then you collaborate on the type of fence that will be put up and the timing. The person paying gets to choose these things.
