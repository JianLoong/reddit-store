I'd pull down the old fence and take my very sweet time putting up a new one on the same spot, not giving them an inch of property.  But, y'know, for those three or four months that it takes you (dragging your feet all the way) to get the fence put back up, I'd complain daily to the HOA when their dogs were on your land...

Equally petty, less permanent", "Nta BUT I\u2019ve heard from a lawyer that can be considered ceding your property so you might want to check.", "NTA. Do you really need that fence? If not, take it down for awhile.

Building the fence one foot inside the property line could demonstrate that you intended to abandon that strip. Also, he could just put a one foot barrier between your fence and his to keep his dogs in. Neighbor wars are easy to start and almost impossible to end. You might be signing up for years of aggravation. Pettiness can be delicious, but it can also backfire. Be careful.", "NTA, but do you have to replace the fence at all?\n\nBTW, I doubt the HOA told them they wouldn't have to pay for anything.  HOA's don't give advice or any of that stuff.", "Coming from someone who is also petty as hell, move the fence in!  \n\nIt kind of sounds like they\u2019re just wanting to benefit from your fence being that they went directly to your HOA to see if they had to. The only other reason I could see is them not having the finances for an unexpected grand at the moment, but if they had good intentions they likely would have been more inclined to trying and come up with a payment plan/compromise which leads me to believe they\u2019re being turds.\n\nTeam petty, move the fence in! NTA", "NTA, but you would essentially be shrinking your property and enlarging theirs.", "NTA but putting it one foot inside the property line means you will have to maintain a one foot strip of grass outside the fence which is hard to do without trespassing on their property. If the fence is on the property line, it belongs to both of you 50/50, so if they do not want to pay half the repalcement cost, let it fall apart and they will have to put up a new fence to keep their dogs on their property, for which you may be willing to pay 50%.", "NTA but losing yard space devalues your home. Depending on where you live, that lost space (yes you still own it but wouldn't be able to access it without knocking the fence down) may actually be worth more than the amount you were hoping from them. \n\nMy advice is build the new fence where the old one was. Ask them not to put anything on it. But really you should probably speak to a lawyer and the HOA here.\n\nEdit to add: \nMost HOAs require you to maintain your lawn. Some to very strict standards. If you have to maintain that strip you should take that into account too.", "If you really want to be petty just remove the fence.", "NTA\n\nThe less you need to interact with property owners near you, the better.", "Gosh.  I love this.  I've dealt with people like this.   You saved them money and now they act like this.  It would be one thing to say they don't have the money, but another thing to get HOA involved and say they don't have to.  They can't wait to get a better fence for FREE.\n\nThe only glitch is if your okay to lose that extra land if there is some weird law that'll bite you in the butt.\n\nNTA to them!  Yta if you will regret losing that land.", "INFO: Why the metal fence? Why not a cheaper, wooden option?", "I don't know how to vote because I think your position is ridiculous even though I understand it.  \n\nDo you know if the neighbors can afford to put out $1k right now without any notice? Maybe their financial situation is not as good as you think and they don't have the money to spend. Plus, I ALWAYS hate when people think they have the right to spend my money without asking my permission in advance. \n\nJust replace your fence and be a good  neighbor. In the long run, being petty does not pay off. It is momentarily satisfying but that quickly wears off. We all know that.  \n\nI'd get the fence and feel good about it.

Our neighbors had a old fence on there side and ours was going to be replaced soon anyway so I told them we could go in on one together and save some money. I was going to put in up myself and I have connections for high end materials so all said their half was 650. They agreed but then they told our other neighbor they were just going to let us handle it all and refuse to pay. So we took both fences down and I asked for their half they refused and said \u201c what are you gonna do not put anything up?\u201d I said ok no worries and put up my new fence a few feet on our property and painted their side of the beautiful white fence safety orange and yellow", "NTA. If you do opt to move the fence and still have to care for the space between them, I suggest planting perennial wildflowers that are native to your area.

Both of the neighbors on either side were original owners of their houses we moved into ours in 2016. So I don\u2019t know if there was ever an issue with the fence what they did with original owner of our house. We only shared a fence with one neighbor because the other has large bushes/trees planted instead. We don\u2019t get along with the neighbors that we share a fence with and decided not to even speak with them about the fence when we decided to replace ours. We just built a new fence line 2 feet into our property (enough space to go between the fences if there are weeds or issues with either fence). They never said anything and this was summer of 2021. We do have a big yard so it wasn\u2019t much of an inconvenience for us. So that might be a factor. But I\u2019m definitely more of avoid conflict and just didn\u2019t want to deal with them at all about it.", "NTA\n\nPut the new fence a foot inside and make a nice flower garden on the part remaining between the two properties.

But I understand the cutting off the nose.", "Generally that law is only if the neighbor is actually using and maintaining it as their own, not just if it isn\u2019t fenced off. And they have to not be aware of where the property line is. I\u2019m sure the amount of time varies by state, but where I live it has to be maintained by a neighbor for twenty years. We almost ran into this when the neighbors thought they owned three acres of my land and were using it as if it was theirs. I went to put in a fence, found the old survey markers, and because they had only been using it for 19 years the land was still mine. Nonetheless, I put the fence on my own property and allow them to continue to use the land. They pay \u201crent\u201d from their vegetable garden, which is on my land. Since they know the land is mine, they can\u2019t take it.

To keep the pets out", "If they ask about the fence just say you will be starting that part of the project soon. Not sure exactly when yet but soon", "Are any of the three going to bother your dog though?", "Remember that you still must maintain that area. A foot isn't going to give you enough room to mow/weed/etc.", "I don't believe you can stop your neighbor from encroaching on your property if you place the new fence a foot onto your property.  When you neighbor mows his yard, he'll be effectively taking on the upkeep of the additional foot and over time, through adverse possession the additional foot of property will legally become your neighbors.", "I\u2019m not sure where you are, but here that move will get them half a foot of land to their name. It\u2019s called adverse possession. So yes, you would giving him that land for free.", "Yeah, but they didn't tell you to fuck yourself. They just declined your request. (I do think they should have kicked in.)", "Added a tiny edit about maintaining the space between depending on HOA rules :)", "If not looking for a fight explain that you\u2019re not paying for their fence to be put up so you will be putting up the fence on your property if they refuse to contribute and if they get pissy about it I recommend something similar", "This was my concern. I'm petty as hell and pro-move the fence but it seems like in doing so could create a pain in the ass lawn maintenance situation.", "Nah. Not in Australia anyway. It\u2019s all about what the surveyors say. Nothing to do where anything is built.", "NC- the law in NC states that your fence must be within your property line.
