I see your line of thinking, which was very considerate of you, but from how you describe her reaction (not angry, not berating, just upset) her reaction was also very considerate of her: it showed she cared. \n\nI think you made the right call, not putting pressure on her to hang out with you over something she clearly wanted to do for herself. \n\nJust know that now y'all's relationship has progressed. She's told you explicitly that she considers you a priority, so feel free to be open and honest about schedule conflicts like this and let her prioritize you as she so chooses.", "NTA. It was doubly thoughtful where you made sure she wasn't faced with a dilemma about the concert and you also avoided the awkward birthday present situation that comes with being so new in a relationship. It was too early for a birthday. I hope she takes a step back and sees it as the thoughtful gesture it was", "NTA\n\nbut a graceful way(if this happens in a future relationship) would have been.  I have birthday coming up.  Would you celebrate with me on X date(not day of concert).", "NTA. Honestly, what a sweet thing to do!", "NTA, it\u2019s a new relationship and you didn\u2019t feel strongly about wanting to spend your birthday with her. I\u2019d make sure you know when -her- birthday is, though, because birthdays seem like a big deal to her.", "Isn't it OP's choice how HE wanted to spend his birthday?", "NAH but she is right.", "Going to get downvoted to hell, but very soft YTA\u2014you were trying to do a thoughtful thing and it was early on in your relationship, but you probably would\u2019ve felt bad if the roles were reversed. Now she\u2019s in a situation where she feels bad that she didn\u2019t do *anything* for your bday when she never had enough info to do so. \n\nSuggestion for how you could\u2019ve handled it would be to mention that you want to celebrate your birthday on a different day\u2014ex. tell her you have plans on the actual day with some high school friends and know she has the concert that night, but that you\u2019d love to do something fun with her the next day (and you guys can tell each other all about the concert/get-together!). \n\nI think you\u2019re both coming from very caring and well-meaning places and hope some communication can iron out any hurt feelings. Best of luck OP!", "NAH but she is right, you should Tell her, do not lie to \"protect\" her, she is not a kid ;) . You could have said she should go to the concert and you will celebrate another time.\n\nAlso, fresh relationship. Do not sweat it.", "NAH, you\u2019re both very considerate actually. You didn\u2019t expect anything from your new partner and your bday doesn\u2019t seem a big deal to you, and her being upset (more with herself than you) means she cares enough to want to celebrate. Honestly pick a do-over day and have the real one next year, this is a sweeter issue than most on this sub", "INFO: why didn't you say anything? Did you think she'd be mad?", "NTA. You were only two weeks in.", "NTA. You called it right.", "Light YTA; you meant well, but she was going to find out eventually and feel worse for missing your birthday without knowing than if you had just told her it was your birthday but you weren\u2019t concerned about celebrating on the day.", " You both had completely valid points of view and perspectives on this. You were considerate of her and she is considerate of you, which is why she wanted to know. Assuming this doesn't stay a big deal for her and the matter is dropped over time this is a solid NAH.", "You\u2019re 100% sure you told her when you\u2019re birthday was? I ask because I had a birthday on Sunday and I forgot about it. My husband and kids let me sleep in and the first out of my mouth were \u201cfuck, the girls have swim practice!\u201d I also thought the cards that came in the mail were belated cards for my daughter until I looked at the address. \n\nAll this is to say, I don\u2019t think my husband would have known my birthday when we were dating unless someone else told him.", "YTA, but not a huge one.\n\nYou could have still had the small party with your friends and her concert, but GF could have arranged a birthday dinner date or something else special for you the next weekend, but you deprived her of the opportunity to do anything nice for you or with you. \n\nThat's not how it should run in a partnership but it's more normal for an aquaintances. I would have been upset too for not being considered close enough to you and would have felt pushed away to acquaintance level.", "Yeah, exactly. If the relationship didn't last very long, then who cares, but at some point she's gonna find out and it gets weird.", "NAH. I'm not sure why you didn't tell her when your birthday was. You could have celebrated it on a different day.", "NTA, you did a nice thing for her, and the relationship doesn't seem to have been serious yet.", "NTA\n\nShe kinda comes across as an AH because you really were faced with an impossible situation where even if you did tell her, she could\u2019ve found an issue with you telling her to make her feel bad for skipping the concert with her friend and criticize you for not telling her sooner. \n\nHopefully y\u2019all can move past this without real conflict but the vibes I\u2019m getting from her being upset about this is that she just wanted to find a way to put the blame on you so she doesn\u2019t feel bad in any way", "NTA. You were in the beginning stages. There was no need to give her tough decisions. She should not feel you tricked or misled her. It was just something you didn't get to yet. Like couples who start dating before the holidays or valentine's, you don't have to make it a big deal or even celebrate together.", "NAH. Noble gesture, but you would have been better off telling her. Your girlfriend could have gone to the concert and organised to take you out for your birthday on the following night or something. You clearly meant well, but she's right: that decision should have been hers to make. Neither of you would have had to feel bad if you had just been upfront about it and worked something out together.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "He didn\u2019t lie; he just didn\u2019t bring it up to a girl he\u2019d only been dating for a few weeks. He readily told her about it when she asked. I don\u2019t think he owed her that information so early in the relationship. He\u2019s NTA.", "I feel like birthday is something that comes up very early on and If you\u2019re in a relationship both should know the others birthday you aren\u2019t the AH for trying to protect her from being sad but maybe prioritizing better communication", "YTA. She's right. You took away her agency to make the choice for herself and infantilized her. You think she wasn't going to find out eventually? Not a great start. Apologize and work on communicating.", "YTA - just tell her the date and make party on different day.. what does it matter people sometimes make birthday parties weeks after the date.you are in mid twenties not teens.", "Bad bot"]}
