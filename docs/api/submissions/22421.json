I see your line of thinking, which was very considerate of you, but from how you describe her reaction (not angry, not berating, just upset) her reaction was also very considerate of her: it showed she cared. \n\nI think you made the right call, not putting pressure on her to hang out with you over something she clearly wanted to do for herself. \n\nJust know that now y'all's relationship has progressed. She's told you explicitly that she considers you a priority, so feel free to be open and honest about schedule conflicts like this and let her prioritize you as she so chooses.", "NTA. It was doubly thoughtful where you made sure she wasn't faced with a dilemma about the concert and you also avoided the awkward birthday present situation that comes with being so new in a relationship. It was too early for a birthday. I hope she takes a step back and sees it as the thoughtful gesture it was", "NTA\n\nbut a graceful way(if this happens in a future relationship) would have been.  I have birthday coming up.  Would you celebrate with me on X date(not day of concert).", "NTA. Honestly, what a sweet thing to do!", "NTA, it\u2019s a new relationship and you didn\u2019t feel strongly about wanting to spend your birthday with her.

Now she\u2019s in a situation where she feels bad that she didn\u2019t do *anything* for your bday when she never had enough info to do so. \n\nSuggestion for how you could\u2019ve handled it would be to mention that you want to celebrate your birthday on a different day\u2014ex. tell her you have plans on the actual day with some high school friends and know she has the concert that night, but that you\u2019d love to do something fun with her the next day (and you guys can tell each other all about the concert/get-together!). \n\nI think you\u2019re both coming from very caring and well-meaning places and hope some communication can iron out any hurt feelings. Best of luck OP!", "NAH but she is right, you should Tell her, do not lie to \"protect\" her, she is not a kid ;) . You could have said she should go to the concert and you will celebrate another time.\n\nAlso, fresh relationship. Do not sweat it.", "NAH, you\u2019re both very considerate actually. You didn\u2019t expect anything from your new partner and your bday doesn\u2019t seem a big deal to you, and her being upset (more with herself than you) means she cares enough to want to celebrate. Honestly pick a do-over day and have the real one next year, this is a sweeter issue than most on this sub", "INFO: why didn't you say anything? Did you think she'd be mad?", "NTA.
