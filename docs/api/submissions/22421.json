She had always wanted to see them and was very excited about it. The only issue was that my birthday was on the same day as the concert.

I never did tell her that she missed my birthday, and that was the end of it until yesterday. Her birthday was on Friday and we had a good time, I stayed over after. In the morning we were talking and she realized she doesn't know when my birthday is. When I told her the date, she was upset with me for never mentioning it before. I told her why I didn't and she basically told me that she would have liked to know, and that I shouldn't be worrying about making her feel bad when ultimately the decision of whether to come to my birthday or go to the concert was hers to make.

She has an entirely valid point- it was HER choice what to do with her time, not yours.

I see your line of thinking, which was very considerate of you, but from how you describe her reaction (not angry, not berating, just upset) her reaction was also very considerate of her: it showed she cared. \n\nI think you made the right call, not putting pressure on her to hang out with you over something she clearly wanted to do for herself. \n\nJust know that now y'all's relationship has progressed.

It was doubly thoughtful where you made sure she wasn't faced with a dilemma about the concert and you also avoided the awkward birthday present situation that comes with being so new in a relationship.
