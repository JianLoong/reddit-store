Emma and my dad have been married for 8 years. I lost my mom to cancer when I was 5 and now I am losing my dad to cancer as well. Because I have never been all that close with Emma or Luna and because when asked, I told my dad I would like to keep the previous plans for me if I lost both parents, which is going to my maternal grandparents, Emma decided we needed therapy together, the three of us, while dad is still here. So we have been going for four months now. The idea of therapy is that when dad is gone we remain a family. Emma wants that. Luna wants that. I don't. Which Emma has always known that for me, any interest in her was always going to have to factor my dad into the equation. Luna kinda knows that as well. I was never the sister she wanted me to be.\n\nFor a couple of weeks they would ask me if I was \"removing them from my table\" when dad dies. That's the expression the therapist has us using to basically ask if we'll be in each other's lives when he goes. The therapist wouldn't let that be asked right away. She wanted to work on some other things first. But she has allowed the question. She has also said I do not need to answer. She reaffirmed that last time. Saying maybe it was something Emma and I should be discussing without Luna present. Emma said Luna deserves to know if her sister doesn't give a shit about her. The therapist said it was not the way things should be worded, and especially not to a child. Emma said it was clear I knew my answer and I should answer. I told her it was clear she knew the answer and would not take hearing it very well and neither would Luna so they should not ask questions they don't want the actual answers to. I told her they were looking to be mad at me but first I needed to say it out loud.\n\nEmma is furious. I know Luna is upset and I feel bad she was there to hear it all. She loves me and has never called me her stepsister or thought of me as not her sibling and I have never returned that and it sucks for her. Emma told me I was a smartass and that at 16 I should know better than to throw away my family. She told me I should not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding to me against her and Luna and that I should not take Luna's only sibling from her when she's losing the only father she knew as well and the only one who gave a damn. I told her she should never have brought us to therapy in the first place when she knew what was happening. \n\nAITA for what I said though?", "created_utc": 1687957846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l9507/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_and_stepsister_not/", "score": 1726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People shouldn't ask questions they don't want the answers to and also, your stepmother saying you shouldn't hold her actions towards you against her is pretty rich.   \"She told me I should not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding to me against her \" - who should take responsibility for that? The Easter bunny? \n\nNTA NTA", "IMO NTA. Here\u2019s why. It\u2019s clear she started the sessions just to manipulate yall and get what she thought would be a backing up from the therapist that you should stay with the family. The situation leading to the argument in the therapist office was all her. She pressured you to answer the question you gave your honest feelings. Now yes it was a lil catty to say \u201cshouldn\u2019t ask questions you don\u2019t want the answers to\u201d imo but at the end of the day you are right. if you don\u2019t want em in your life they should be able to respect that. From the way yoh put it they could feel that you were in that position but the stepmom still pressed you. My question, how does your father feel about it? Does he also want y\u2019all to stay a family?", "NTA - I give you credit for even GOING to this 'therapy' session.  It sounds more like a browbeating session to get you to change your mind about going to your grandparents!  I am sorry for your losses, but there is no reason for you to be stuck with a SM and SS, when your father passes.  Emma sounds like she is trying to hold on to your father through you.", "NTA. She was trying to manipulate you, hoping you would be nice and give her the answer she wanted because your step sister was there.", "NTA. But Emma is. Let's see, you lost your Mom at 5, got a new family at 8 and now are losing your dad at 16. That's a lot. Then she forces you into therapy for her own reasons - \"not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding me against her...\" Therapy should be a safe space and she's using it for her own devices and trying to manipulate you with Luna.\n\nAsk Emma to shelf this and get you an individual therapist to work through everything that is happening in your life, you'll benefit no matter who you end up living with. And talk to Luna, alone. She's hurting as well. She needs to know what's happening between you and Emma is not her fault. \n\nI am so sorry that you are now losing both your bio-parents. That is terrible.", "NTA\n\n>She told me I should not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding to me against her\n\nThis right here? This says so much about Emma. She knows you two do not have a relationship. She knows she's done wrong by you. **And she doesn't care.** The worst part is she wants you to not care either, because it's not convenient for her.", "NTA, Emma kept pushing a question the therapist didn\u2019t think should be answered at the time. Hell, you weren\u2019t too comfortable answering it in the beginning.", "I am so sorry for your loss, OP. I lost my father to cancer too, though I was 21 when it happened. It's a pain that never goes away entirely, I can't imagine what it must be like going through it twice so young.\n\nClearly, your stepmom had a set idea of how therapy would go and was blindsided when it didn't go that way. The way you put was a bit harsh, but that's only because she made the question harsh in the first place. I do kinda understand her point of view, she is not just losing her husband, she feels like she's losing her family with him. That is not your problem, but it does explain where she might be coming from.\n\nYou're NTA, but I think it'd be good for you to look for therapy for yourself. I find odd you don't feel like a family after living together for half your life, I think you should investigate why you haven't been able to make that bond. Not for their sake, for your own: it's something that might be an issue in forming new relationships as you grow up and create a family of your own (that is, if that's something you want to do).", "NTA.

It's a tough time for you and guilt trips shouldn't be thrown in your direction.", "NTA I don't understand her motive in this. Why is this so important? Honestly, I'd be more concerned if you wanted to stay with them. My step mother or if my life will be a celebration", "NTA. Emma thinks that therapy is just a means of getting what she wants. I can see why you don't want to stay with her. She is ruining any chance there is of a relationship between you and Luna.", "NTA. At all. \n\nI have to wonder - is there some kind of financial reason behind her wanting you to stay with them when/if your dad passes? This is a question you need to know the answer to.", "NTA. Emma is being disingenious. She knew what your post-dad goal is. She set up this joint therapy with the idea that she could change that goal. That's not what therapy is for or how it works. You are not a bad person for feeling as you do and wanting to live with your maternal grandparents. \n\nIt is okay for Emma not to like your decision. It is okay to recognize that your decision may be hard on Luna and to feel bad about it.  However is is also okay for your to not change your mind and go ahead with your plans as they are. Life is complicated and there are are seldom perfect solutions. We have to go with the one that works best. I am so sorry for your upcoming loss and wish you the best for the future.", "INFO: What did Luna do to make you dislike her so much? Emma I can understand, but from the post, you make it sound like all Luna wanted was to be your sister. Why is that a bad thing?", "NTA. Why is your stepmother so hell-bent on keeping you in her home after your father passes? It doesn\u2019t sound like your relationship with your stepmother has been all that great throughout the years. Could it be because you will be receiving Social Security death benefits as a minor and Luna will not? Will you be receiving a large inheritance that your stepmother will manage? Are you the primary babysitter for Luna? I do think you should follow your therapists guidance on interacting with your stepmother and stepsister. There really is no reason for you to be cruel to either one. It\u2019s entirely possible that once you move in with your grandparents you may want the opportunity to visit with one or both of them and a little bit of empathy and kindness would go along way. It\u2019s important to remember that they are both losing someone they love, your father. And your stepsister clearly loves you, even if you don\u2019t feel the same way, it will be a loss for her.", "NTA she just doesn't want outsiders to think she's a bad step mother that drove away her partners kid, definitely looking to control the narrative", "NTA, she is trying yo manipulate ypu with a \u201ctreat\u201d (a family) that you don\u2019t even want to begin with. \n\nA thought though: obviously Emma needs to go but would ypu consider holding a small door open for Luna? You know the pain of losing a parent and she is innocent in her mom\u2019s shitshow. Once you are going, she\u2019s alone with this manipulative looney. She might seriously need help to get away in 4-6 years from now and it does not sound like she has a lot of people she can depend on\u2026\n\nLike maybe a phone number where she can reach you in an emergency", "[deleted]", "NTA for saying what you thought. And condolences for the loss of your mother and your father's illness.\n\nBut please consider this. It seems odd that you would have no familial feelings toward Emma or Luna when they have been in your life for so long. They obviously love you if they want to go through therapy to improve your relationship and want to stay in your life after your father passes. Unless there is some major reason for discord, like abuse or addiction, I hope you reconsider having them in your lives. \n\nEspecially when you become older, family is very important for mutual support. Your grandparents are older and sadly won't be in your life long term. If you cut ties with Emma and Luna you may not have close family after they pass. I just fear you are throwing away having people in your life who care about you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Emma seems to be hyper focused on minimizing the trauma for Luna regardless of the impact that might have on you.  It's horrible for Luna but you can't be her emotional support sister.

Therapy would help you think through these reasons, see how they affected your relationship, which feelings stem from the issues you have with her. Again, the point is not fixing your relationship with her: it's making sure your relationship with her doesn't affect your future relationships.\n\nIt would also help you understand your feelings about Luna. When you say \"I was never the sister she wanted me to be\", it seems, to me, that there is some sort of regret or guilt there. Even if you never talk to her again, I think that's good looking into, for your own peace of mind.\n\nOf course, none of this needs to be done now. You're still in the process of losing your dad, it might not be the time to deal with those issues. But I think it's something that would be good to do in the future.", "It sounds like her behavior is a lot of the reason you have n feelings for Luna. Tell Emma this in therapy. If it matters at all to her that you and Luna have a relationship, she needs to take herself out of the equation.", "Just remember that she's a kid who loves your dad, and she's losing him too. She is the only other person who feels even close to how you do. No one can make you care for someone, but compassion is never a waste of time. She doesn't deserve to be used by her mom and you as some sort of weapon or battleground, and that's what's happening.\n\nNTA for being honest when pushed, but y t a a bit for being so cruel to a kid who's done nothing to you but be born.", "What did your stepmom do in the past?", "Maybe now or maybe sometime in the future, you can tell her that it's not her fault you feel the way you do. Just that. \"It's not your fault. You're a great kid, there's nothing wrong with you.\" \n\nIf Emma hadn't poisoned things with you, you might have felt differently about Luna. Someday maybe you two will, in fact, click. But that may never happen and Luna should know that it wasn't her fault.", "Like I said, mostly a thought on my side. You don\u2019t really meantion how much family Emma has around, which was what promted my answer. Of Luna has plenty of grandparents, aunts/uncles and cousins, then sure, close that door entirely. \n\nBut if she ends up with only having her mom for support, then yikes. And it\u2019s not because you have to be a sister, but if she ever needs someone to pick her up because she is escaping home, who does she have? Anyone at all?", "Keep in mind that if Luna does feel the need to get out of Emma's house at some point in the future, she may not have anywhere else to go (may not have close friends or trusted family members, and if she does, they may not be able to take her in). I do agree that it would be better if she could stay with someone who has an active relationship with her, but if she's in a bad spot, safety would be the top priority. Though you don't wish to have a sibling relationship (and that's fine!), it does seem like you care enough that you don't want her to be in a bad spot and would ensure her safety, at minimum.\n\nDon't feel pressured to make a decision like that right now, especially since she's fairly young, and something like that may not even happen. But it's something to think about over the next few years, so you can be ready with an answer in case it does come up in the future.", "You are forced to go because you obviously need therapy. You're shut down. You reject people who have done nothing to you like they are the villains in your story. And no, Luna has done nothing to you, but try to be your sister.

They have been in your life since you were a small child, and you still reject them. Now your dad has cancer, and you're going to be an orphan, and now you're rejecting even therapy. You may not like it, and you may not agree, but you need help. Stop fighting it. It can help.", "I understand. I thought you went off. I would have. But all you said was what you felt. You weren't rude degrading or anything. Don't feel bad. I hope your grandparents can help you heal from all the pain you have gone through. \n\nSaying what you feel isn't wrong, its how you say it. And you didn't say anything wrong. Your stepmother should have known when to shut up instead of pressuring you in a \"safe space\". Don't feel bad.

I agree with it.", "I was thinking the same.\nOr that OP has inheritated money.\n\nEmma is to agressive as if the therapy should keep OP with her.\n\nNTA\n\nI'm sorry that you have to face such grieve OP at your age", "That's why I feel like I should have just said nothing. Not answering was at least not causing more issues and she had a front row seat for those issues to come out more. She doesn't deserve that. I hope her mom focuses on her when dad does die. I also hope she doesn't try to encourage her to keep trying to have a relationship with me. Emma has always pushed Luna on me. part of me worries that won't end.", "I had a stuffy that my parents bought me before I was born. It had my mom's perfume and they made socks for it out of my dad's socks. She felt like it should have something of Luna's on it at least (she was going to add something of herself later) without even asking if I wanted that. She ruined that stuffy. That was easily for me the worst thing.\n\nWhen I was younger, in an effort for us to have something to bond over, because she knew I wasn't looking to make her my new mom, she signed me up for this competitive swim class because she did competitive swim all the way until college. I couldn't swim very well and she was told that. She signed me up anyway and those kids were awful to me and so was the coach. I had to tell dad all about it and he pulled me. She was upset about that. He told her she never should have forced me.\n\nA few months after she married my dad, I had to make this family tree project. I wasn't including her or Luna in it and she didn't like that so she made her own and swapped it out of my bag the night before. Got me into trouble at school and really annoyed me because she made my mom and maternal line's names and drawings so much sloppier than theirs.\n\nThose are three of the things.", "Emma has fucked up many times, something she admits. She has done things that cannot be forgiven. So yes, I reject her and I have no interest in being her family. That's never what we were really. She was barely tolerated for the sake of my dad and nothing more.", "For what it's worth, I am so sorry you have to go through all of this. I can tell you're just trying to get through with your head above water. Is it possible to move in with your grandparents now?", "Better for the kid to know you\u2019re cold to her than to expect you to be there when you\u2019re clearly uninterested. Stringing her along is not going to be good. That being said, I\u2019ve read a lot of these stories where as adults the one half sibling really regrets not making an attempt to have a relationship.

If so, my understanding (IANAL) is that Emma would be your remaining legal parent. There are all sorts of ways she could leverage being an AH because of it\u2026 but it would also make the attempt at therapy \u201cto remain a family\u201d something that is not unreasonable.

Pointless, really, and only another burden on you, to do this at all.  \n\nIf Emma cared about her daughter, Luna wouldn't be involved in this, not at this time.  Emma sounds very manipulative, like **she's trying to get Luna involved in making you feel guilty** and staying.  \n\n *Emma told me I was a smartass* \n\n**She's insulting you.

She knows what those reasons are.  She knows your interests are better served by living elsewhere,** and ***it's not what Emma wants.***  \n\nEmma is trying to force your compliance with **her wants**, **while she ignores your needs.**  That's usually combined with other abusive behaviors. \n\n**She's responsible for her behaviors,** not you.

And you are still a child.  **Emma is doing here another thing that abusers do:  she is trying to force you to be responsible for her responsibility:**  her child.  You are not responsible for Luna's grief, or her loses, or her needs, or her feelings, or her issues.  You are a child, and a responsible adult should be taking care of your needs.  **Emma is doing very wrong, to try to make you feel responsible like this.  She's manipulating.** \n\n*I told her she should never have brought us to therapy in the first place when she knew what was happening.*\n\nYou are right.  Therapy should be about how to help each other handle grief, how to deal with grief.  It's not about how to force your husband's child to choose living with you instead of someone that loves and cares for them and proves it with kindness and meeting their needs.  Emma is doing this for herself, not for you or Luna.  Her behavior is appalling.  Your time is better spent with your dad, or packing up your stuff to send to your grandparents.  This therapy is a waste of time.  It's not being used to help you, which it should be.  And Emma won't achieve her goals with it, because her goals are manipulative and selfish, not parental, kind or loving.\r  \n\r  \n*AITA for what I said though?*\n\nNTA.  You were right.

Not that you wouldn't stay around for him, but ***just get the odd bits out of the way, so there's less to do later with Emma angry at you, and maybe taking that anger out in inappropriate ways.*** \n\n Maybe look through storage \\[attic, basement, unused rooms, closets, cupboards, outbuildings, etc.\\] and take all the things that were your mother's, and the things that are old memory items for you, and Grandparents could come get those things first?  It could **give you time to ask your dad about those things,** as you sort out what goes.  And it would protect those things from Emma having any control over them.  This way, **you get dad's approval on taking these things, and he can tell you where to find things, if he's up to it.**  He **might have special things set aside for you, somewhere, that you don't know about.** \n\nThen slowly have Grandparents pick up other things, depending on how this all goes.  They can take papers and account numbers and that kind of thing, and talk to him about all that, and then whatever things you don't really need every day, so that you are left with basics that you need for everyday, but will have less to move later.   Sorry to talk about this, but it could save you hassle from Emma later, about getting your stuff.  If it gets to your dad not being able to come back home, your grandparents can move you out during that time, and still take you to visit, or if they live far, one of them can stay with you in a hotel for his last days, so you aren't having to go back without someone at the house to help you feel safe. \n\nI am so sorry that Emma is doing this to you, at such a time.

Even if you never felt like she was really your sister, you have to have some sort of relationship after 8 years.

This sounds like a really, really tough situation. You\u2019re about to lose a second parent and that is already harder than hard.

Fuck that.   \n\nIt\u2019s a sad situation for Luna. Very sad. But you have to look after yourself OP. It\u2019s a shitty choice and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t actively want Luna to be in pain, but it sounds like that\u2019s inevitable. Emma though, Emma can fuck right off.

It sounds like maybe now is the time to spend more time with your grandfolk, to start establishing connections and your future there, and actively begin peeling yourself away from Emma.   \n\nIf I was you, I\u2019d decline to go to therapy with her any more.", "NTA. A couple suggestions:\n\n1. Can you (gently, if you\u2019re worried about upsetting him) ask your dad if he thinks any part of her motives could be financial, relating to her access to your inheritance? He may not have considered that, and if it\u2019s the case then he\u2019s probably the only one who can effectively call her out, even if he can\u2019t come to the therapy sessions.\n\n2. Go to your next appointment with a letter; ask the therapist to read it out on your behalf, so your stepmother can\u2019t say you should have stopped if she ignores point a: then, in the letter, say: \n\na) You\u2019re uncomfortable with her daughter being present for the reading of this letter; loss is a challenging topic for everyone, and should be addressed in age-appropriate ways. By insisting on her daughter\u2019s presence, she\u2019s preventing you from getting the support you need, and manipulatively preventing you from communicating in the honest and open way that could get you all onto the same page. Luna can attend some sessions when the topic is age-appropriate, but you\u2019ve conveyed that the contents of this letter are not age-appropriate for a 12-year-old and you can\u2019t be held responsible if she ignores that and keeps her daughter in the room for what follows. Ask the therapist to pause there and encourage your stepsister to wait elsewhere. Then proceed to \n\nb) You\u2019re very uncomfortable with her trying to make you, a minor losing her father, responsible for her and her stepdaughter\u2019s happiness. You need the space to grieve without being responsible for an adult and a child, and you feel she\u2019s trying to use you as a prop or an emotional support human for her game of house. This isn\u2019t a storybook ending, your father is dying, and her insistence that you can just play happy family and support her daughter during your grief is unfair and cruel.\n\nc) You understand that family is important, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve asked to go to family \u2014 but you need to go to family who can support you through your grief, not stay with people who would expect or need your support. You can\u2019t be playing daughter or sister to others who are in mourning when you\u2019re going through the loss of a second parent, and it\u2019s bordering on parentification for her to try to make you responsible for her daughter\u2019s feelings, especially now of all times. \n\nd) She claims she wants to be a parent to you, but she\u2019s not acting like one by trying to make you responsible for her feelings and those of her daughter. You\u2019re going through the hardest event of your life at 16 and instead of caring about how to support you, her only concern is whether you\u2019ll give her the storybook ending she wants. You\u2019ve watched her expose her own daughter to so much hurt, using her to manipulate you in these therapy sessions, and she\u2019s trying to use you as a prop in her game of house. You understand she wants a straight answer on what type of relationship you\u2019ll have after your father\u2019s passing; well, you were receptive at the start of therapy, but throughout this process she\u2019s shown you her priorities and how she sees her daughter(s), and as things currently stand you can\u2019t picture her being anything but harmful to your wellbeing. You realize that it\u2019s hard to hear, but trying to protect her feelings has taken too much of a toll already, and if she really wants to be a parent to you, the first step is allowing you to express your feelings honestly \u2014 even when those feelings are painful or difficult.\n\ne) You genuinely want her and her daughter to be happy and healthy; you just can\u2019t be the one responsible for creating that happiness, especially not when you\u2019re grieving so horribly yourself.\n\nI\u2019d also ask the therapist whether it would be appropriate to show this letter to your father, as well. I understand why he can\u2019t attend therapy with you, but while he\u2019s still alive and cognizant of what\u2019s going on, he should still be as much of a father to you as he can be. He may not be able to step in as much as he would want to, but i suspect it will be a huge relief for you to be honest with him. Also, I could be mistaken, but I\u2019m guessing you\u2019d find a great deal of peace if you could know he was happy with you going to your grandparents, and I think he\u2019ll be able to give you that if he better understands your feelings.

Don't let this drama spoil your final memories of your father.\n\nBe clear with your father and grandparents that you are moving out, and just lie to your MIL. Let her think you are considering sticking around for a bit even though you're grandparents will be your official guardians, but don't want to talk about it.

She is doing the wrong thing, both by her own daughter and OP, but I just don\u2019t see the evidence, that she is some caniving mastermind, plotting to steal OP\u2019s inheritance or use her as free labour. I see a woman who has desperately wanted for her household to be one family, and who know has to face the fact that that family is falling apart and never really was a Unit to begin with. Again, she has went about all of this in the worst way possible and has hurt OP in a terrible way in the process. OP will be better off without her", "I seriously hope you are not taking all the \"she wants your money\" as fact. I have done a fair bit of estate planning over the years (though I'm a litigator, really), and I will say, it woukd be an exceedingly simple matter to protect your money from your stepmother, like via a trust. Perhaps you made a comment I haven't read that better outlines her behavior lower in this thread someplace, but I was abandoned by a parent as a child, had a step-parent, didn't face the loss of my one remaining bio parent admittedly, but I didn't get along with my stepfather at your age. \n\nNot at all.\n\nI am decades removed from being your age. I can tell you that I have not only managed to build a relationship with my stepfather, I am much closer to him than my mother, and havr a much bettet relationship. \n\nBeing a parent is fucking hard. Being a step-parent is even tougher. You fuck up sometimes. Little problems become mountains. You don't have the shared blood that binds many families who cannot stand one another. \n\nBut, if you believe that your stepmother loves you, and thst your sister loves you, that is the foundation through which you can build a lifelong relationship that helps you thrive in this life. \n\nI know you are representing that isn't what you want. I wouod have done the EXACT SAME THING you are doing at your age. And it would have been one of the biggest mistakes of my life. \n\nIf you really feel nothing, then that's what that is. But if you are like I was, outwardly tough while on the inside frightened about the things happening that you cannot control, in pain due to the loss you have experienced, feeling like you have no family bc you don't really fit right anywhere, and you are preemptively rejecting a situation before you are rejected, I urge you to speak to your therapist about those feelings. About any fears you may have about staying. \n\nMaybe it is as simple as you say, but I just wanted to share my experience. My life changed when I stopped letting my fear and insecurity dictate how much I engaged with my family. I resolved to start hugging them whrn I visited, I resolved to make an effort to actually be famy, and once I allowed it, I was rewarded. YMMV, but honestly, nothing you have written makes it seem like these relationships aren't salvageable. But obviously, they won't be if you are determined not to make the effort. In that case, grandparents it is.", "iirc OP would just start getting survivor benefits under dad's record", "> May the bridges you burn light your way.\n\nI am stealing this.
