Emma and my dad have been married for 8 years. I lost my mom to cancer when I was 5 and now I am losing my dad to cancer as well. Because I have never been all that close with Emma or Luna and because when asked, I told my dad I would like to keep the previous plans for me if I lost both parents, which is going to my maternal grandparents, Emma decided we needed therapy together, the three of us, while dad is still here. So we have been going for four months now. The idea of therapy is that when dad is gone we remain a family. Emma wants that. Luna wants that. I don't. Which Emma has always known that for me, any interest in her was always going to have to factor my dad into the equation. Luna kinda knows that as well. I was never the sister she wanted me to be.\n\nFor a couple of weeks they would ask me if I was \"removing them from my table\" when dad dies. That's the expression the therapist has us using to basically ask if we'll be in each other's lives when he goes. The therapist wouldn't let that be asked right away. She wanted to work on some other things first. But she has allowed the question. She has also said I do not need to answer. She reaffirmed that last time. Saying maybe it was something Emma and I should be discussing without Luna present. Emma said Luna deserves to know if her sister doesn't give a shit about her. The therapist said it was not the way things should be worded, and especially not to a child. Emma said it was clear I knew my answer and I should answer. I told her it was clear she knew the answer and would not take hearing it very well and neither would Luna so they should not ask questions they don't want the actual answers to. I told her they were looking to be mad at me but first I needed to say it out loud.\n\nEmma is furious. I know Luna is upset and I feel bad she was there to hear it all. She loves me and has never called me her stepsister or thought of me as not her sibling and I have never returned that and it sucks for her. Emma told me I was a smartass and that at 16 I should know better than to throw away my family. She told me I should not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding to me against her and Luna and that I should not take Luna's only sibling from her when she's losing the only father she knew as well and the only one who gave a damn. I told her she should never have brought us to therapy in the first place when she knew what was happening. \n\nAITA for what I said though?", "created_utc": 1687957846, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14l9507/aita_for_telling_my_stepmother_and_stepsister_not/", "score": 384, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

People shouldn't ask questions they don't want the answers to and also, your stepmother saying you shouldn't hold her actions towards you against her is pretty rich.   \"She told me I should not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding to me against her \" - who should take responsibility for that? The Easter bunny? \n\nNTA NTA", "IMO NTA. Here\u2019s why. It\u2019s clear she started the sessions just to manipulate yall and get what she thought would be a backing up from the therapist that you should stay with the family. The situation leading to the argument in the therapist office was all her. She pressured you to answer the question you gave your honest feelings. Now yes you are kinda an asshole for how you worded it but at the end of the day if you don\u2019t want em in your life they should be able to respect that. From the way yoh put it they could feel that you were in that position but the stepmom still pressed you. My question, how does your father feel about it? Does he also want y\u2019all to stay a family?", "NTA - I give you credit for even GOING to this 'therapy' session.  It sounds more like a browbeating session to get you to change your mind about going to your grandparents!  I am sorry for your losses, but there is no reason for you to be stuck with a SM and SS, when your father passes.  Emma sounds like she is trying to hold on to your father through you.", "NTA. She was trying to manipulate you, hoping you would be nice and give her the answer she wanted because your step sister was there.", "NTA. But Emma is. Let's see, you lost your Mom at 5, got a new family at 8 and now are losing your dad at 16. That's a lot. Then she forces you into therapy for her own reasons - \"not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding me against her...\" Therapy should be a safe space and she's using it for her own devices and trying to manipulate you with Luna.\n\nAsk Emma to shelf this and get you an individual therapist to work through everything that is happening in your life, you'll benefit no matter who you end up living with. And talk to Luna, alone. She's hurting as well. She needs to know what's happening between you and Emma is not her fault. \n\nI am so sorry that you are now losing both your bio-parents. That is terrible.", "NTA\n\n>She told me I should not hold all the bad decisions she made regarding to me against her\n\nThis right here? This says so much about Emma. She knows you two do not have a relationship. She knows she's done wrong by you. **And she doesn't care.** The worst part is she wants you to not care either, because it's not convenient for her.", "NTA, Emma kept pushing a question the therapist didn\u2019t think should be answered at the time. Hell, you weren\u2019t too comfortable answering it in the beginning.", "I am so sorry for your loss, OP. I lost my father to cancer too, though I was 21 when it happened. It's a pain that never goes away entirely, I can't imagine what it must be like going through it twice so young.\n\nClearly, your stepmom had a set idea of how therapy would go and was blindsided when it didn't go that way. The way you put was a bit harsh, but that's only because she made the question harsh in the first place. I do kinda understand her point of view, she is not just losing her husband, she feels like she's losing her family with him. That is not your problem, but it does explain where she might be coming from.\n\nYou're NTA, but I think it'd be good for you to look for therapy for yourself. I find odd you don't feel like a family after living together for half your life, I think you should investigate why you haven't been able to make that bond. Not for their sake, for your own: it's something that might be an issue in forming new relationships as you grow up and create a family of your own (that is, if that's something you want to do).", "NTA.  I'm not seeing what the problem is with you having a preference on who you live with. It's a tough time for you and guilt trips shouldn't be thrown in your direction.", "NTA I don't understand her motive in this. Why is this so important? Honestly, I'd be more concerned if you wanted to stay with them. My step mother or if my life will be a celebration", "NTA. Emma thinks that therapy is just a means of getting what she wants. I can see why you don't want to stay with her. She is ruining any chance there is of a relationship between you and Luna.", "NTA. At all. \n\nI have to wonder - is there some kind of financial reason behind her wanting you to stay with them when/if your dad passes? This is a question you need to know the answer to.", "NTA. Emma is being disingenious. She knew what your post-dad goal is. She set up this joint therapy with the idea that she could change that goal. That's not what therapy is for or how it works. You are not a bad person for feeling as you do and wanting to live with your maternal grandparents. \n\nIt is okay for Emma not to like your decision. It is okay to recognize that your decision may be hard on Luna and to feel bad about it.  However is is also okay for your to not change your mind and go ahead with your plans as they are. Life is complicated and there are are seldom perfect solutions. We have to go with the one that works best. I am so sorry for your upcoming loss and wish you the best for the future.", "INFO: What did Luna do to make you dislike her so much? Emma I can understand, but from the post, you make it sound like all Luna wanted was to be your sister. Why is that a bad thing?", "NTA. Why is your stepmother so hell-bent on keeping you in her home after your father passes? It doesn\u2019t sound like your relationship with your stepmother has been all that great throughout the years. Could it be because you will be receiving Social Security death benefits as a minor and Luna will not? Will you be receiving a large inheritance that your stepmother will manage? Are you the primary babysitter for Luna? I do think you should follow your therapists guidance on interacting with your stepmother and stepsister. There really is no reason for you to be cruel to either one. It\u2019s entirely possible that once you move in with your grandparents you may want the opportunity to visit with one or both of them and a little bit of empathy and kindness would go along way. It\u2019s important to remember that they are both losing someone they love, your father. And your stepsister clearly loves you, even if you don\u2019t feel the same way, it will be a loss for her.", "NTA she just doesn't want outsiders to think she's a bad step mother that drove away her partners kid, definitely looking to control the narrative", "NTA, she is trying yo manipulate ypu with a \u201ctreat\u201d (a family) that you don\u2019t even want to begin with. \n\nA thought though: obviously Emma needs to go but would ypu consider holding a small door open for Luna? You know the pain of losing a parent and she is innocent in her mom\u2019s shitshow. Once you are going, she\u2019s alone with this manipulative looney. She might seriously need help to get away in 4-6 years from now and it does not sound like she has a lot of people she can depend on\u2026\n\nLike maybe a phone number where she can reach you in an emergency", "[deleted]", "NTA for saying what you thought. And condolences for the loss of your mother and your father's illness.\n\nBut please consider this. It seems odd that you would have no familial feelings toward Emma or Luna when they have been in your life for so long. They obviously love you if they want to go through therapy to improve your relationship and want to stay in your life after your father passes. Unless there is some major reason for discord, like abuse or addiction, I hope you reconsider having them in your lives. \n\nEspecially when you become older, family is very important for mutual support. Your grandparents are older and sadly won't be in your life long term. If you cut ties with Emma and Luna you may not have close family after they pass. I just fear you are throwing away having people in your life who care about you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Emma seems to be hyper focused on minimizing the trauma for Luna regardless of the impact that might have on you.  It's horrible for Luna but you can't be her emotional support sister.

Therapy would help you think through these reasons, see how they affected your relationship, which feelings stem from the issues you have with her. Again, the point is not fixing your relationship with her: it's making sure your relationship with her doesn't affect your future relationships.\n\nIt would also help you understand your feelings about Luna.

Just that. \"It's not your fault. You're a great kid, there's nothing wrong with you.\" \n\nIf Emma hadn't poisoned things with you, you might have felt differently about Luna. Someday maybe you two will, in fact, click. But that may never happen and Luna should know that it wasn't her fault.", "Like I said, mostly a thought on my side. You don\u2019t really meantion how much family Emma has around, which was what promted my answer. Of Luna has plenty of grandparents, aunts/uncles and cousins, then sure, close that door entirely. \n\nBut if she ends up with only having her mom for support, then yikes. And it\u2019s not because you have to be a sister, but if she ever needs someone to pick her up because she is escaping home, who does she have? Anyone at all?", "Keep in mind that if Luna does feel the need to get out of Emma's house at some point in the future, she may not have anywhere else to go (may not have close friends or trusted family members, and if she does, they may not be able to take her in). I do agree that it would be better if she could stay with someone who has an active relationship with her, but if she's in a bad spot, safety would be the top priority. Though you don't wish to have a sibling relationship (and that's fine!), it does seem like you care enough that you don't want her to be in a bad spot and would ensure her safety, at minimum.\n\nDon't feel pressured to make a decision like that right now, especially since she's fairly young, and something like that may not even happen. But it's something to think about over the next few years, so you can be ready with an answer in case it does come up in the future.", "You are forced to go because you obviously need therapy.

They have been in your life since you were a small child, and you still reject them. Now your dad has cancer, and you're going to be an orphan, and now you're rejecting even therapy.

You weren't rude degrading or anything. Don't feel bad. I hope your grandparents can help you heal from all the pain you have gone through. \n\nSaying what you feel isn't wrong, its how you say it.

Not answering was at least not causing more issues and she had a front row seat for those issues to come out more. She doesn't deserve that. I hope her mom focuses on her when dad does die. I also hope she doesn't try to encourage her to keep trying to have a relationship with me. Emma has always pushed Luna on me. part of me worries that won't end.", "I had a stuffy that my parents bought me before I was born. It had my mom's perfume and they made socks for it out of my dad's socks. She felt like it should have something of Luna's on it at least (she was going to add something of herself later) without even asking if I wanted that. She ruined that stuffy. That was easily for me the worst thing.\n\nWhen I was younger, in an effort for us to have something to bond over, because she knew I wasn't looking to make her my new mom, she signed me up for this competitive swim class because she did competitive swim all the way until college. I couldn't swim very well and she was told that. She signed me up anyway and those kids were awful to me and so was the coach. I had to tell dad all about it and he pulled me. She was upset about that. He told her she never should have forced me.\n\nA few months after she married my dad, I had to make this family tree project. I wasn't including her or Luna in it and she didn't like that so she made her own and swapped it out of my bag the night before. Got me into trouble at school and really annoyed me because she made my mom and maternal line's names and drawings so much sloppier than theirs.\n\nThose are three of the things.", "Emma has fucked up many times, something she admits. She has done things that cannot be forgiven. So yes, I reject her and I have no interest in being her family. That's never what we were really. She was barely tolerated for the sake of my dad and nothing more.", "For what it's worth, I am so sorry you have to go through all of this. I can tell you're just trying to get through with your head above water. Is it possible to move in with your grandparents now?", "Better for the kid to know you\u2019re cold to her than to expect you to be there when you\u2019re clearly uninterested. Stringing her along is not going to be good. That being said, I\u2019ve read a lot of these stories where as adults the one half sibling really regrets not making an attempt to have a relationship. Make sure you know what you\u2019re doing when you burn this bridge, it cannot be unburnt.", "She's awful. Hope you can get away from her. Does your dad have a will so you get your inheritance? Don't want her holding that hostage and forcing you to be Luna's permanent babysitter.", "Honestly don\u2019t listen to this person. They\u2019re clearly projecting, hence the nasty, condescending attitude. There is nothing wrong with you that needs fixing because you don\u2019t want someone in your life. You\u2019re allowed to decide you simply aren\u2019t interested in a relationship with someone. \n\nAnd for the record, assuming they were including Emma in their statement was totally fair, because they used \u2018people\u2019 plural, and we have no other examples of you rejecting anyone.

LUNA HAD DONE NOTHING TO YOU. It's literally spelled out for you, and you still didn't bother to comprehend. I get it. You're a teenager. You're angsty, and you know everything so everyone else is wrong, never you. I'm not saying you have to live with them. Personally, I wouldn't want to live with you either. I'm saying that you do need therapy.", "What did Emma do? Because you refuse to give examples so I can see why people are telling you you\u2019re shutting down and being an AH.\n\nEdit: based on your comment, I think this is a NAH. Emma made mistakes, but you\u2019re punishing a 12 year old who has always viewed you as a sister. It\u2019s a lose lose situation.", "Thank you.

My grandparents are in charge of it now and will continue to be when he dies. He does have a will made also.", "*Individual* therapy might very well be helpful for you, OP. Not because there is anything wrong with how you feel, but to help you process those feelings in light of the very heavy life events you are going through. Family counseling with Emma and Luna just sounds harmful to all involved. Does the therapist know about the unforgivable things Emma did in the past? Not that you need to share that here, but sharing with the therapist might give her better context for why things are the way they are and why they are unlikely to change.", "You said I reject people who have done nothing. I assumed you meant Emma as well. I won't deny that Luna did nothing to me. I have admitted that.", "I had a stuffy that my parents bought me before I was born. It had my mom's perfume and they made socks for it out of my dad's socks. She felt like it should have something of Luna's on it at least (she was going to add something of herself later) without even asking if I wanted that. She ruined that stuffy. That was easily for me the worst thing.\n\nWhen I was younger, in an effort for us to have something to bond over, because she knew I wasn't looking to make her my new mom, she signed me up for this competitive swim class because she did competitive swim all the way until college. I couldn't swim very well and she was told that. She signed me up anyway and those kids were awful to me and so was the coach. I had to tell dad all about it and he pulled me. She was upset about that. He told her she never should have forced me.\n\nA few months after she married my dad, I had to make this family tree project. I wasn't including her or Luna in it and she didn't like that so she made her own and swapped it out of my bag the night before. Got me into trouble at school and really annoyed me because she made my mom and maternal line's names and drawings so much sloppier than theirs.\n\nThose are three of the things.", "Fuck I just wish I could give you the biggest hug. Maybe a batch of PB no-bakes too. Be strong, and remember that no matter what, he loves you.", "Go easy on yourself. When my dad was in hospice, we all stayed constantly by his side. He passed in a rare moment when my mom had stepped outside, my siblings had stepped away, and I had dozed off on the sofa next to his bed. In hindsight, I still believe he waited for that moment of being alone to leave us. He needed that to let go. I am betting it was the same for your Mom.", "I'm really glad. Your dad has planned too.", "This is exactly why you need therapy. You assume. Even though I specifically said Luna, you assumed. I'm not saying you have to be family with Emma. I'm saying that you need the therapy. You reject Luna. Why? She has done nothing to you, but you reject her. This is a slippery slope you are on.", "You don't need a reason to reject people dude.", "When you start rejecting people when you are 8. Yeah. There's a problem. That's why OP needs therapy.", "NTA - your father is dying from cancer, you\u2019re dealing with losing a second parent, and your step mom makes it about her. I see why you don\u2019t want to be around her.", "NTA but do you have access to individual therapy? That's a lot to go through as a teenager.\n\nAlso I agree with other commenters that it might help to tell Luna that none of this is her fault. But I also get that you need to make the best decisions for your own life", "NTA it is sad for Luna, but emma clearly was not interested in really resolving issues as much as thinking this would coerce you into changing your mind. When that didn't happen she's gotten upset. odds are the therapist has noted this too.", "Any chance your dad has let her k ow something about the Will that makes you being on good terms with her and having s sibling relationship with her daughter critically important.  \n\nSo many people in families seem to believe that therapy id intended to convince opposing parties that one of the parties is wrong.  \n\nShe did what many second spouses do; especially when they start a second family. They want their child or children and their status as a parent to erase the first spouse, etc.  if she was mean to you after marrying your dad, she may have been in that operational mode.  But now her husband is dying and his first family child is still a minor.  Perhaps there is more for you to learn.\n\nWho picked the therapist?", "NTA, but I think the topic of her bad decisions needs to tabled as to why you you have zero interest in maintaining a relationship with her.\n\nYou should also have a private discussion with you dad to ensure you are the sole beneficiary to all of his assets/life insurance/superannuation.\n\nAfter the trauma of losing two parents, leaving you destitute when it could be avoided would be a cruel twist.\n\nI am so sorry for you loss. and the loss to come.", "Is there money involved that Emma will lose? Good grief, you are losing your last parent and Luna has a mom still. You rank higher on the pain scale in my book", "I can't help but wonder if step mom would be in charge of any inheritance should she retain custody of OP. It sure sounds like she's pushing too hard for some reason.  If so, don't waste time. Talk to your dad.", "YTA, but your honesty is on another level. Therapy sessions just became a lot more interesting for your stepmom and stepsister!", "NTA.", "NTA, sorry for what you're passing through but it's not about you making up for Luna. She has a parent for it.", "NTA", "NTA. Emma should consider her daughter more. I don't think it's good for such a young girl to have to sit through that. It's only hurting her. You are hurting her. She's experience too much hurt. Just like you.\n\nI hope you do well in life. I hope you are happy when you move to be with your grand parents. I think it's best for your stepsister and yourself to be away from each other. Your coldness towards her would only continue to hurt Luna. It would be nice if you two could have an amicable relationship in the future. Not necessarily friends but cordial.", "NTA. Maybe start getting all your documents and start bringing personal items to your grandparents, because your stepmother isn't going to make it easy after your father passes. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "Wonder if step mom sees a future in which she remarries and step dad does to Luna what she did to you?", "Is she worried that you living with the grandparents because she did as she did will now have those grandparents much less interested in Luna?", "\"Maybe there would have been a little room at the table, but not after the Stuffy, the enforced swimming and all the negative situations we have gone through - there is simply not room at my table for anyone like that\"", "Regarding Luna and your lack of feeling or sentiment toward her, if you see a therapist who is a good match, you may find tour neutrality toward Emma is a protection you put up.  In other words, Emma may, one day, be somebody you recognize as having been disadvantaged greatly.  Her mom is forceful and unrelenting.  That could be hard on Emma too.  When Emma reaches her teen years and if mom remarries, life could become really rough for her in a way you can relate to.  \n\nYou don\u2019t have to \u201cfeel\u201d for Emma.  Just know she isn\u2019t offensive to you and like you, had no say at all in what happened in her life or relationships.  You may not know what her relationship with your dad is either so consider keeping the door open.\n\nOne thing that may be an issue is that having a relationship with her puts you in the crosshairs of her mom who may manipulate that.  That is understandable.  There may be a way, here and there, to maintain a quiet link to Emma.  If not now, later on.  \n\nCan you speak to tour dad about his concerns for you and his daughter?", "NTA but if possible, you might want to talk to your grandparents about the situation, and see if they can work with a lawyer to have custody transferred before your father's illness continues to progress. You could also ask a nurse if there's a social worker at the hospital who can help you. I'm so sorry that you're having to deal with such an awful situation. I hope there are supportive adults you can talk to about it.", "No hun, NTA. You need to get to your maternal grandparents when the inevitable happens. That line of Emma\u2019s, that you shouldn\u2019t hold grudges for past things that she did to you, that\u2019s the most insane thing I\u2019ve ever heard. Children need to be cared for, loved and respected. My guess is that you\u2019ve never felt particularly loved or respected by her. Why should you stay? You deserve a place where you will be happy.", "Nta. Make sure your grandparents know what is going on.", "What do I feel that the house/assets were partly your mother, and would go to your next gurdian?", "NTA\n\nWilling to bet stepmom only wants you around because of money, and that's why she is trying to hard to manipulate you. \n\nDon't give in if you don't want to stay with her and make sure that your resources are protected because you will need them with both of your parents gone.\n\nAlso, my deepest sympathies for your losses. I'm sorry that your stepmother is trying to manipulate you for her own gain, and I don't feel she has your best interests at heart. Take care of yourself, and don't feel that you are an asshole.

Judging from your post and comments, it seems like Emma is wanting to keep up this happy family charade so that she can either a) access your mom\u2019s money somehow, or b) use you as a babysitter, or maybe both.

While you're only 16?? NTA 10x over.

Focusing on being alive and taking care of yourself is all that matters.", "NTA", "NTA - I lost my mom to cancer at 11 and my dad remarried 3 years later. It was a rocky transition to say the least. Although now, since I moved out of the house, my stepmom and I are somewhat friends (not family). I can\u2019t even imagine losing my dad as well, but if I did, I can guarantee I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to keep my step-family in my life. Especially not if she used therapy as what seems to me like a manipulation tactic, with no regard for her actual kid\u2019s feelings.", "Not just that, but step mom is only concerned about her daughter, not OP. She focused on how her daughter is losing her dad while OP is going to be an orphan. It seems she's more concerned that OP won't be her daughter's emotional support human.", "NTA.

But I am saying that if they aren\u2019t detriments to your happiness, it may not be a bad idea for you to leave that family door open and maybe see them every once in a while.

Stepmom is expecting you to act like an adult. You've already had to grow up way too fast, losing your mom and being forced to accept a new family.

NTA a million times. I'm sorry you have to go through this.", "It\u2019s a damn good saying.", "Not directly but he and mom saved a lot of money for me up until she died. The reason it was so much is mom came into a lot of money before she died and it all went to me. But that account is protected by my grandparents. Dad himself doesn't have a lot but I guess he has enough.", "I was thinking that too because she (Step person) wants to keep you as her -built in babysitter. \nshe\u2019ll probably be getting married again after he\u2019s gone and she can con and manipulate her next victim(s)", "Eh, I get the sense that there is some bad blood there already.

That subtly indicates that you won\u2019t be using your money from your mom until you need to and also that your step mother will be expected to act as a parent in providing for you. Just as a way to get her to stop pushing?", "Or maybe she is thinking of her own daughter who clearly loves OP and is losing a father figure? Agreed, stepmom is not trying to keep the family together for OP\u2019s benifit, but as a mother myself, I can definately understand desperately trying to ease what is going to be a very traumatic blow for my child in any way possible. The stepmother is being wrong, selfish and cruel, but I can empathise with a mother who must be stressed, scared and grieving with only more heartbreak on the horizon, not just for herself, but for her child as Well. It doesn\u2019t excuse how she is treating a soon to be orphan, who she supposedly cares about, so incredibly cruelly, though. OP, my heart breaks for you. I\u2019m so sorry that you are facing something so terrible and made to feel guilty on top of it. Go live with your grandparents and don\u2019t feel guilty. Trying to force a family out of you wouldn\u2019t be fair on either your or your stepsister. Your stepmom\u2019s problems aren\u2019t yours to solve or your responsibility.", "Baby sitter AND bank.
