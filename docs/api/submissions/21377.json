Piece of advice though, I have had to do several calls. I make it a policy to say I can neither confirm nor deny that I made the call should a parent ask. In general, if a parent is asking if you called, they don't want to thank you.", "NTA. First of all, when in doubt if a child is in danger, better to be safe than sorry. I can't imagine which situation would actually justify leaving a 5 years old locked inside an appartment at 2AM, as a mother I can tell you that even in a case of emergency I would have take my son with me. So many things can go wrong within one hour.", "NTA at all. Do not doubt yourself here.", "NTA, you did the right thing. The kid was screaming out the help. You got the kid help.", "NTA - I would've done the same thing if I saw that a child might've fallen from an open window.", "NTA at all. The police might have gone away, but this woman will get in trouble for child endangerment/abandonment. You were 100% justified to call the cops.", "NTA for sure.  Thanks for trying to protect the poor kiddo.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve called too. She put her child at risk. You did the right thing.", "NTA. That was absolutely the right thing to do", "NTA. Always report missing children when their parents aren\u2019t in sight.", "NTA\n Leaving a 5 year old alone for even 5 minutes is not safe", "1. The kid cried for an hour, how long were they alone for before they woke up, realized mom and dad aren\u2019t there, and got upset. \n\n2. If a kid that age falls out of a window from the 3rd floor they are going to be seriously injured. \n\nNTA you did the absolute right thing. Good on you for paying attention to the kid and caring enough to call for help. Parents should be thanking you.", "NTA\nThat kid was left alone, who knows what would have happened.", "NTA absolutely.  Well done for protecting a child.  Though I would say if it ever , God forbids,  happens again say you were woken up by the commotion.", "You did the right thing. Good job for calling emergency. OP NTA.", "You did the exact right thing in that situation. Don't let it get you down, while the mother seems to think it's no big deal it is a very serious situation.
