It's totally fine to simplify these things on Reddit so long as they don't lead to misinformation!", "Ty..now I definitely have to look up C-PTSD and RAD...My head is spinning now lol...C-PTSD and RAD are terms I've never heard b4...hubby is a Disabled Navy Veteran and yes I've heard about PTSD...have you ever heard of \"Secondary PTSD\"?", "RAD is reactive attachment disorder, which develops early in life related to babies and toddlers who received inconsistent care.

That child needed an adult with them for their own safety. It's illegal to leave young children alone in most countries for a reason. \n\nI am very glad you went to talk to the child, I bet that made them feel less alone :) Also emergency services responded quickly and took it seriously, which shows that you were right to call them.\n\nNTA", "Nope not the AH. Anytime I see a child hanging dangerously over anything it becomes my business, if that kid did fall you would never be able to forgive yourself for doing nothing", "NTA.  They left their child home alone.  Anything could have happened to that child.  You did the right thing.  You did what was best for the child.", "NTA - Children that age should not be left unattended at 3 am imho. \n\nYou did the right thing.

Glad you were there who knows what could of happened to that child", "Nta and if you had done nothing and something happened to the child you would have regretted it forever.\nDon't let her gaslight you into thinking your at fault.she left a 5 year old unattended then verbally accosted a 17 year old in front of cops...shes the problem not you", "NTA. Let me show you another outcome: you see the kid fall and die. You call the police to report it and the mother comes back and then screams at you because you didn't call the cops earlier.\n\nYou did right OP. You prevented a kid from getting hurt or even dying. You did right.", "NTA. You 100% did the right thing.", "NTA. You did pretty much everything right. You waited to see if there's was an adult caretaker nearby before intervening, it sounds like you asked the right questions (how old he is and where his grownup(s) are), you did your best to calm him down, and called emergency services.\n\nI bet the mom is one of those people who thinks it's okay to leave their kid home alone for \"just 5 minutes.\" Terrible parenting", "NTA\n\nYou were the best case scenario.", "NTA. You did the right thing.", "NTA, you did the right thing.

The child was scared and you did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nMore like HERO in my opinion. Some people are garbage as parents.....then they try to deflect the issue to someone else.\n\nYou ABSOLUTELY did the right thing.

In future don't tell someone that you called.  Most of the time they wanna yell at the person that called because they're angry and upset at their own actions.", "NTA. It was dangerous situation that could've turned out fatal. You did what was right.", "Mom probably had a boyfriend over. Sadly common enough.", "I've often thought how emotionally difficult working in a 911 center must be.", "I don't really think it was an emergency either. Even more, I wonder if she just left the kid sleeping and went off. Imagine the fear of waking up in the middle of the night and finding yourself alone.\n\nSo many things truly can go wrong with a kid this young unsupervised. Once we were at my brother's house having dinner for New year's Eve in his backyard. My niece, who was around 4 at the time, asked her mother if she could swim in the pool, that it was just next to us. She said no, since it was late and it was cold. My niece didn't protested, and went playing inside.\n\n10-15 minutes later, we notice things are oddly quiet, so we went inside. She was in the bathroom, filling up the bathtub with extremely hot water. Since it was cold for the pool, she decided to have a hot bath instead. Thankfully she was waiting for the tub to be full to get in.\n\nI also once got a call because my son, who was considerably older at the time (around 7) had an \"incident\" at break in school. The teacher told me to not worry since he was ok, but I would see some \"marks around his neck\".\n\nApparently, they were left unsupervised and found a sort of string at school. He and a couple of friends decided it \"was a fun idea to play that they were pets\".  So one of the kids actually tied this string around his neck to use as a leash while he was running around the playground pretending he was a dog. Of course he fell, and since the other kid was grabbing the string, he mildly choke.\n\nI had said many \"no\" to my kid over the years. Don't put anything over your head, don't touch plugs, don't open the fridge without your shoes on, etc etc etc. This one in particular, is one I didn't see coming.\n\nKids can get so very creative. They can truly and seriously hurt themselves in a situation like this.", "In case of emergency you take kid with you. I been a single Mum. You just never left kids that age alone at home.

You get up, grab the kids and go.\n\nNO EXCUSE for that woman", "Leaving your child unattended, at that age, is a serious safety issue.\n\nHe's not getting cPTSD from being home alone, and while it might cause issues later on, primal survival terror is far from the likeliest outcome.\n\nOP was NTA,and the mother was incredibly reckless and in the wrong - but you are trivializing cPTSD, etc, by trying to say this specific incident could cause it.", "If a boyfriend was over, the mom wouldn't be outside the apartment coming home.", "\"I'm sorry, I don't speak English.\"", "As others have said, who knows how long that child was alone before waking up.", "That's why you have to say it even when you didn't", "You don't need to know about 112 to understand context clues.", "If they're coming up with an action plan, then action is needed. There you go.", "Don't open the fridge without shoes on?????", "Doubt this would be an isolated incident of abuse and neglect", "There\u2019s an episode of a show, can\u2019t remember which one, where a white woman working at a motel tells the cast that she can\u2019t speak English and when they ask where she\u2019s from she says Connecticut \ud83d\ude02 your comment made me think of that", "For apartment dwellers like me, the trash is out 2 locked doors and past 4 houses. \n5 year olds are fine for a few minutes.

We're not all ignorant. And some of us are even of non-white *immigrant* origins! \n\nDid you know that means we didn't originate in America? \n\nMeaning we came from other countries.\n\nMeaning several Americans know that a whole world exists outside of America and they even know how things work in other countries!\n\nDon't forget the Americans who make an effort to learn about other cultures in general out of common sense or genuine interest. And basically any kid who goes to a school that teaches global studies.", "No wonder people become helicopter parents. 5 years old and you think a child cant be be left alone for 5 minutes? May as well not even blink at that point, what if the child is struck by a meteor in the .04 seconds your eyes are closed?", "Which one'd be equally unable to stop if one were taking an extra long dump, or in the shower, or taking out the trash.

And, when they can be co-morbid, it only gets more confusing.", ">Americans know less about people in other countries than other countries know about the USA, that's a fact.\n\nHow ironic that you claim Americans know less than people in other countries when it seems you don't know a thing about Americans. Did every American in existence tell you they know nothing? \n\nAlso do you know how huge Texas is? A person who was born and raised in northern Texas is a little bit less likely to know Spanish than someone who lives right by the southern border. Did you also know that just because someone lives in Texas doesn't mean they always lived in Texas? \n\nFurthermore, Texas isn't representative of the entirety of America. Texas is one state out of fifty. I know so many white Americans who speak more than one language (due to actually having a desire to learn other languages) and have experiences with other countries.\n\nI don't know where you get your so-called facts but you're completely wrong."]}
