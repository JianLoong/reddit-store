Piece of advice though, I have had to do several calls. I make it a policy to say I can neither confirm nor deny that I made the call should a parent ask. In general, if a parent is asking if you called, they don't want to thank you.", "NTA. First of all, when in doubt if a child is in danger, better to be safe than sorry. I can't imagine which situation would actually justify leaving a 5 years old locked inside an appartment at 2AM, as a mother I can tell you that even in a case of emergency I would have take my son with me. So many things can go wrong within one hour.", "NTA at all. Do not doubt yourself here.", "NTA, you did the right thing. The kid was screaming out the help. You got the kid help.", "NTA - I would've done the same thing if I saw that a child might've fallen from an open window.", "NTA at all. The police might have gone away, but this woman will get in trouble for child endangerment/abandonment. You were 100% justified to call the cops.", "NTA for sure.  Thanks for trying to protect the poor kiddo.", "NTA. I would\u2019ve called too. She put her child at risk. You did the right thing.", "NTA. That was absolutely the right thing to do", "NTA.

The kid cried for an hour, how long were they alone for before they woke up, realized mom and dad aren\u2019t there, and got upset. \n\n2.

Good on you for paying attention to the kid and caring enough to call for help. Parents should be thanking you.", "NTA\nThat kid was left alone, who knows what would have happened.", "NTA absolutely.  Well done for protecting a child.  Though I would say if it ever , God forbids,  happens again say you were woken up by the commotion.", "You did the right thing. Good job for calling emergency. OP NTA.", "You did the exact right thing in that situation. Don't let it get you down, while the mother seems to think it's no big deal it is a very serious situation.

You absolutely did the right thing.. that at poor child.", "NTA. For all you know the parents had gone out and walked in front of a bus. The kid had been crying for an hour. Calling the police was entirely appropriate.", "\nNTA you did the right thing. She\u2019s mad because she knows what she did was wrong. And now she\u2019s busted.", "NTA. I would have done exactly the same. Better safe than sorry, and it sounds as though there\u2019s something to be investigated here. You did a very good thing.", "NTA, I can't believe they would leave a little boy alone and locked in the house. That is so beyond dangerous. I'm glad you called the cops, you did the right thing and if you ever see it again, CALL AGAIN. if someone asks you if you called the cops on them though, don't admit it was you, more than likely they don't wanna thank you \ud83d\udc80", "NTA. I worked as a supervisor in a 9-1-1 emergency call center, equivalent to 112.\n\nThis absolutely was an appropriate call. The child was left alone for hours and you had no idea when a responsible adult might return. I was child neglect. \n\nThank you for making the call.", "NTA. You are a good kid, well done. She was angry that she is in trouble now, but at least the kid didn't fall out of the window and you saved it. Letting your kid alone at 3am is never a good idea.", "as a mother of 4, absolutly NTA , so many things could go wronggggggg and i m not by far a helicopter mom but this is unthinkable. and that open window o my god no no no", "You are so right, what if there had been a fire?", "Oh my goodness that poor kid. No, you did the right thing. NTA", "There are sometimes stories on the news of parents who abandoned their small children resulting in their death. You did the RIGHT thing!!!! NTA", "NTA...You did the absolutely BEST thing!! Ty for that!! And please don't ever doubt yourself..I'm going to borrow a line from Gibbs{from the TV show \"NCIS\",paraphrasing of course}..\"It's better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission\" ..and that's very true. And as my Dad and my hubby{both Navy Vets\" say to me when I doubt myself making a scary decision..\"Follow your gut..it doesn't let ya down\"..After living in a crazy state in an even crazier town I've had to decide to follow my gut and make the difficult decision to call the police in difficult situations. And believe me as scared as I was I made the decision to call the Police. Even when I got a Police Officer{or a Dispatcher} giving me guff about calling them for help I never regretted doing the correct thing. I've been threatened by Property Owners/Property Managers to evict me because I've called the Police, the Fire Department or Ambulance, their excuse was that my calling for help was an annoyance, that it was a \"violation\" of my lease..which according to our city & state law is not...even if a Property Owner/Manager writes it in a lease..So if the parent/parents threatened bringing in those in charge be sure to familiarize yourself with tenant's rights..over 17 years in that silly city I made it one priority to keep up on tenant's rights as well as city,state & federal laws...Sorry I digress..You may be young but you are certainly not \"clueless\"..not only did you call for help you stayed to protect that young child..you are very smart, caring and brave..especially when the mother showed up giving ya guff! And the female cop does sound very nice...and so are you!", "Seriously? Nta. 5 years old, alone at night.", "NTA thank you for helping the child", "NTA. You were concerned for the safety of a child.", "NTA \n\nMy kids are 9 and 10, I only go to dollar store to pick up things for supper that I forgot (right around the corner, no more than 8 minutes) with them fully awake. I would NEVER leave them alone at night. As other have said, who knows how long that child was alone for before they even woke up. \n\nYou made the right call, no pun intended.", "NTA. Most likely the parents (or single mom) work nights and put the kid to bed, thinking he'd sleep through the night and not notice he was alone if he woke up. While I get *why* they did this from a theoretical standpoint (childcare is expensive and the rent has to get paid), this is both dangerous and traumatizing.\n\nIn this situation, this kid was not coping well and crying out for *an hour*. You waited long enough before you called; this was not \"for nothing.\" Unintentional injury arise from situations like this ([https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading\\_causes\\_of\\_death\\_by\\_age\\_group\\_2020-508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2020-508.pdf)).", "NTA for reasons explained in other comments but why tf did 4 emergency vehicles turn up for one lost child?", "NTA\nGiven the open window, the kid could have fallen and died. Small children should never be left unattended. You did the right thing.", "NTA . If something would happen in the house that poor child couldn't even get out. You did good op.", "Dude hard NTA. You saw a kid who needed help and you called the people that could help them. Mandatory reporting is a thing", "She is only sorry she got caught out. You are not at all in the wrong and I'm proud of you for not ignoring the child's distress. Absolutely NTA", "NTA and if this happens again i hope you call again. That child could have gotten seriously hurt or worse by themselves in a 3rd floor apartment", "NTA\n\nI don't know what floor he was on, but even a short drop could be potentially deadly\n\n\nYou did the right thing, OP. Don't doubt yourself.", "NTA. Even if you feel a tiny bit bad for calling the cops you\u2019d fell a hell of a lot worse if you hadn\u2019t and something went terribly wrong. You did the right thing.", "It\u2019s also incredibly traumatizing for the child to be left alone for so long. A child has no idea of time and 1 hour feels like a lifetime. A lifetime of primal survival terror. That is dangerous too, albeit not physically. \nHe can develop some serious cPTSD from this event alone. \n\nOP, you did right by the child by showing him that he wasn\u2019t alone and that some adults were there for him.", "Agree that OP is NTA but it's fine to leave a 5yo alone for 5 minutes. You can get the mail or take out the trash and leave the kid home alone", "That's not really leaving the home, though, and is unlikely to even take 5 minutes. The problem is, you get people thinking \"5 minutes is ok\", then they think they can just run down to the store a few minutes away, and then that takes a few extra minutes, but goes ok This Time, so they make it a habit, and eventually it doesn't go ok."]}
