I worked as a supervisor in a 9-1-1 emergency call center, equivalent to 112.\n\nThis absolutely was an appropriate call.

And please don't ever doubt yourself..I'm going to borrow a line from Gibbs{from the TV show \"NCIS\",paraphrasing of course}..\"It's better to ask for forgiveness than to ask for permission\" ..and that's very true. And as my Dad and my hubby{both Navy Vets\" say to me when I doubt myself making a scary decision..\"Follow your gut..it doesn't let ya down\"..After living in a crazy state in an even crazier town I've had to decide to follow my gut and make the difficult decision to call the police in difficult situations. And believe me as scared as I was I made the decision to call the Police. Even when I got a Police Officer{or a Dispatcher} giving me guff about calling them for help I never regretted doing the correct thing. I've been threatened by Property Owners/Property Managers to evict me because I've called the Police, the Fire Department or Ambulance, their excuse was that my calling for help was an annoyance, that it was a \"violation\" of my lease..which according to our city & state law is not...even if a Property Owner/Manager writes it in a lease..So if the parent/parents threatened bringing in those in charge be sure to familiarize yourself with tenant's rights..over 17 years in that silly city I made it one priority to keep up on tenant's rights as well as city,state & federal laws...Sorry I digress..You may be young but you are certainly not \"clueless\"..not only did you call for help you stayed to protect that young child..you are very smart, caring and brave..especially when the mother showed up giving ya guff!

You were concerned for the safety of a child.", "NTA \n\nMy kids are 9 and 10, I only go to dollar store to pick up things for supper that I forgot (right around the corner, no more than 8 minutes) with them fully awake. I would NEVER leave them alone at night. As other have said, who knows how long that child was alone for before they even woke up. \n\nYou made the right call, no pun intended.", "NTA. Most likely the parents (or single mom) work nights and put the kid to bed, thinking he'd sleep through the night and not notice he was alone if he woke up. While I get *why* they did this from a theoretical standpoint (childcare is expensive and the rent has to get paid), this is both dangerous and traumatizing.\n\nIn this situation, this kid was not coping well and crying out for *an hour*. You waited long enough before you called; this was not \"for nothing.\" Unintentional injury arise from situations like this ([https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading\\_causes\\_of\\_death\\_by\\_age\\_group\\_2020-508.pdf](https://www.cdc.gov/injury/wisqars/pdf/leading_causes_of_death_by_age_group_2020-508.pdf)).", "NTA for reasons explained in other comments but why tf did 4 emergency vehicles turn up for one lost child?", "NTA\nGiven the open window, the kid could have fallen and died.

You are not at all in the wrong and I'm proud of you for not ignoring the child's distress. Absolutely NTA", "NTA and if this happens again i hope you call again.

You did the right thing.", "It\u2019s also incredibly traumatizing for the child to be left alone for so long. A child has no idea of time and 1 hour feels like a lifetime. A lifetime of primal survival terror. That is dangerous too, albeit not physically. \nHe can develop some serious cPTSD from this event alone. \n\nOP, you did right by the child by showing him that he wasn\u2019t alone and that some adults were there for him.", "Agree that OP is NTA but it's fine to leave a 5yo alone for 5 minutes. You can get the mail or take out the trash and leave the kid home alone", "That's not really leaving the home, though, and is unlikely to even take 5 minutes. The problem is, you get people thinking \"5 minutes is ok\", then they think they can just run down to the store a few minutes away, and then that takes a few extra minutes, but goes ok This Time, so they make it a habit, and eventually it doesn't go ok.", "Your Mum should be so proud of you for using your initiative and doing the right thing! \n\n*Big, squishy Mum hugs*", "Leaving a 5 year old alone is a really bad idea. You absolutely did the right thing because he was in danger.

Hold your head up. You did the right thing. There are only two AHs here and it\u2019s the parents.", "NTA you probably saved that child\u2019s life. If you have any doubt about whether you did the right thing, just imagine if you found out in the morning that the child got hurt while on its own. Imagine living with the \u201cI should have done something\u201d in your head for the rest of your life. If the mother had a good reason (no idea what that could possibly be) it will get sorted by the police. When it comes to kids/animals/elderly (anyone vulnerable) always err on the side of caution and if you\u2019re wrong the worst thing is you took up some of their time. The worst case scenario if you do nothing is just aweful!", "NTA it was the ethical and legally responsible thing to do.", "The Mum is TA for leaving her kid alone in the apartment. Anything could have happened. That's how Madeline McCann was taken!\n\nShe's angry cause she got caught out and projected her anger onto you. It's her fault she got in that situation. Not yours. You did the right thing. NTA.", "Nope. You called the cops because a 5 year old was left unattended for a Mn extended period.", "NTA, and this is probably not the first time kid has been left alone nor last.  Tip Never tell them you called the cops. So if you can now get a camera or something for your door that mom will likely now have it out for you. You did the right thing, sadly though no good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA\n\nA good parent wouldn\u2019t have left their small child alone for (at least) an hour. \n\nHell, even if it was a complete misunderstanding and the child wasn\u2019t left alone, a good parent wouldn\u2019t get angry about someone making sure their child was safe.\n\nIf someone gets angry about the police/child services being called, it\u2019s because they believe they\u2019re doing something wrong. Sometimes, that\u2019s just parental insecurity and the social worker puts their mind at rest, but more often the child is at risk and needs help to get into a more stable environment, either by teaching willing parents better ways of parenting or (in worst cases) by finding safer care options.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the safety and wellbeing of the child is the foremost priority.", "HOLY CRAP.\n\nIf this was in China I \\*might\\* understand this happening.\n\nLife's tough there and parents normally leave their kids in the care of someone elderly. But this no. And at 3AM?!\n\nYou did the right thing. Definitely NTA. You never leave a kid, that age, alone. Heck Eric Clapton wrote a song about his.

That person could have taken the child into an apartment and done who knows what or could have just taken the child.\n\nThe mother was angry because she was caught doing something stupid and illegal. No child should be left out alone crying for an hour. You know that because you have empathy.

Imagine if the kid had fallen out of the window or something.", "NTA. You are a great person, know it. And you did everything right.", "NTA\n\nIt became your business when the kid was outside screaming and sobbing and you could hear it from your home.", "Thank you for looking out for that child. You absolutely did nothing wrong; that sad excuse for a parent did.

According to the OP the kid said both parents left, which hints against the single mom theory.\n\nAlso the mom arrived soon after the police and fire truck arrived.\n\nTo me that seems more like the parents went to a party/ get together in the neighbourhood and simply left the sleeping child at home. And when they noticed the lights from the police near their house the mom speed back to see what's happening.", "This. Mine are teens now and perfectly fine alone, but on the odd occasion their dad has a seizure and has to go to hospital, I wake them to tell them what\u2019s going on and that we\u2019re going- even at their ages, waking up with nobody there when you think they were is scary!", "CPTSD is repeated trauma. PTSD is from a singular trauma. I think you meant PTSD.", "That is an oversimplification of both.", "Agreed! You took the words right out of my mouth!!", "\"Oversimplification\" of what?", "PTSD and C-PTSD, and within the US, only PTSD is an accepted  diagnosis, though C-PTSD is helpful for conceptualization, and I use it all the time.\n\nPTSD can be caused by one trauma or multiple traumas, and similarly to C-PTSD can be caused by a build-up of smaller traumas as well. \n\nC-PTSD has more to so with the context of one's life overall  and is often difficult to tease out from other challenging diagnoses like RAD and some personality disorders. \n\nIt is an oversimplification to state PTSD is caused by one major trauma (it's not) and that C-PTSD is only caused by multiple smaller traumas (it's not just that)."]}
