Even when I got a Police Officer{or a Dispatcher} giving me guff about calling them for help I never regretted doing the correct thing. I've been threatened by Property Owners/Property Managers to evict me because I've called the Police, the Fire Department or Ambulance, their excuse was that my calling for help was an annoyance, that it was a \"violation\" of my lease..which according to our city & state law is not...even if a Property Owner/Manager writes it in a lease..So if the parent/parents threatened bringing in those in charge be sure to familiarize yourself with tenant's rights..over 17 years in that silly city I made it one priority to keep up on tenant's rights as well as city,state & federal laws...Sorry I digress..You may be young but you are certainly not \"clueless\"..not only did you call for help you stayed to protect that young child..you are very smart, caring and brave..especially when the mother showed up giving ya guff!

You can get the mail or take out the trash and leave the kid home alone", "That's not really leaving the home, though, and is unlikely to even take 5 minutes.

Sometimes, that\u2019s just parental insecurity and the social worker puts their mind at rest, but more often the child is at risk and needs help to get into a more stable environment, either by teaching willing parents better ways of parenting or (in worst cases) by finding safer care options.\n\nRegardless of the outcome, the safety and wellbeing of the child is the foremost priority.", "HOLY CRAP.\n\nIf this was in China I \\*might\\* understand this happening.\n\nLife's tough there and parents normally leave their kids in the care of someone elderly.

The key difference is that PTSD is attached to a concrete memory or event whereas CPTSD is often not. It's totally fine to simplify these things on Reddit so long as they don't lead to misinformation!", "Ty..now I definitely have to look up C-PTSD and RAD...My head is spinning now lol...C-PTSD and RAD are terms I've never heard b4...hubby is a Disabled Navy Veteran and yes I've heard about PTSD...have you ever heard of \"Secondary PTSD\"?", "RAD is reactive attachment disorder, which develops early in life related to babies and toddlers who received inconsistent care.

Once we were at my brother's house having dinner for New year's Eve in his backyard.

My niece didn't protested, and went playing inside.\n\n10-15 minutes later, we notice things are oddly quiet, so we went inside.

He and a couple of friends decided it \"was a fun idea to play that they were pets\".  So one of the kids actually tied this string around his neck to use as a leash while he was running around the playground pretending he was a dog. Of course he fell, and since the other kid was grabbing the string, he mildly choke.\n\nI had said many \"no\" to my kid over the years.
