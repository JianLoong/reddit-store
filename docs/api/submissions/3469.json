Apologies if this is all a mess, I'm exhausted and I've been crying for hours.**\n\nI 18m live with my mom  \" Mary \" 59f and my brother \" Jake \" 23m. My dad left a long time ago so it's always been just the three of us. My mom raised my brother and I by herself, and did her best to love us equally.\n\nMy mom owns a four-bedroom house and lets me and Jake live there. I'm really grateful for that, and pay her rent every month as well as help around the house. I currently have the second biggest room, which my mom thought was fair since I'm still living at home.\n\nJake recently fell on hard times and has come to live with us. He's struggling with money right now, so my mom didn't charge him rent. I don't care personally, as it is her house, and I think she can do whatever she likes. Although it's a bit hard since he doesn't help out much with chores or food, I get along pretty well with my brother and everything was going fine.\n\nI work full-time, so I'm not always around. My mom does as well and Jakes does not. Yesterday I came home later than usual, and went upstairs as I typically do. I was surprised to see Jake sitting in my room, all his stuff in there.\n\nI found my mom and asked her what was going on. She calmly explained to me that Jake felt like his room was too small so they decided he could have mine. They moved my stuff into his room and it was no big deal.\n\nAt this point I was fuming but I tried not to make a big fuss over it. I went back upstairs and realized my hamster was gone, as well as her cage. I panicked and looked for her everywhere before my mom told me that she sold her and the cage because there was \" no more space \" anymore. Well, that was the last straw for me. I know it's a hamster but I paid for her and everything else myself, and I really loved my little buddy.\n\nI screamed at my mom and told her she was a selfish asshole and a cold-hearted bitch who was picking favorites. My mom broke down crying and my brother came out, cursing me out for making our mother cry. I called him a parasitic leech and packed my things.\n\nI called my boyfriend to come pick me up and I've been staying with him ever since. My brother and relatives have been blowing up my phone demanding I apologize for what I said and making my mom cry. I'm feeling guilty now because of it so now I'm  wondering if I'm in the wrong.\n\n*Edit - Hi, I saw some people asking questions, so I thought I would clear up any confusion.*\n\n1. *Yes, we have a four bedroom house, but one is an office. I had an incredibly large cage that wouldn't fit in the room they gave me or frankly anywhere else.*\n2. *I think someone asked me if my mom was struggling, no, she's not. She makes well over 150k a year and money has never been an issue. She charged me rent so I would help pay for the utilities and such.*\n\n*3. I am doing everything I can to get my baby back. I've been calling pet stores, friends, family, and even neighbors nonstop. I will file a police report tomorrow, since it's late here.*", "created_utc": 1669680260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z7dckl/aita_for_screaming_at_my_mother_after_she_gave_my/", "score": 900, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely in no way okay and reason enough for you consider leaving them to deal with their own mess.\n\nThem deciding your brother gets your room, then swapping out belongings while you're out without even telling you in advance?

This took time and planning and they hid it from you on purpose.", "While it's not uncommon (parents will tell you otherwise, but they just often don't see it) to have favorites between kids, this is toxic favoritism. Don't go back, go minimum contact, see if she even wants to have a relationship with you.

Also don't apologize, because quite frankly, you have nothing to apologize for. NTA Your mom tho... The list of asshole moves on her part would've been long.", "NTA - nothing wrong in calling them out for what they are. You pay rent so you have a say, what they did is wrong and should be called out on. You\u2019re 18 and you\u2019re paying rent, she did the bare minimum for you so you owe her nothing, you\u2019re paying rent so she\u2019s abusing you for doing what she did.

Your mom and brother were completely in the wrong.\n\nBut I'm not sure I'd go NC with your mom (depends on if before this she was a good and supportive mom). It's entirely possible that your brother is manipulating her to act this way. It's possible he somehow convinced her the room switch was necessary and wouldn't be a big deal. He was the one that was cursing you, while your mom at least seemed upset that the move had hurt you.\n\nNot saying you should apologize and/or forgive her, but you might want to try to salvage some relationship with her. If you do, I'd suggest reaching out and setting up a meeting with just her at a public place. Let her know how much this decision hurt her and tell her she's the one that needs to repair the relationship, if she wants it to continue.", "I mean I want to say NTA but also you didn\u2019t handle that well.
