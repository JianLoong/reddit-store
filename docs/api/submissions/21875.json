My dog pooped on the sidewalk that happened to be in front of a cafe in NYC \u2013 Owner was not happy.", "selftext": "I just had an experience that I am not sure how to feel about. I was walking my dog on a commercial street filled with small businesses and shops in Queens, NY. I had just come from the vet and my dog, a beagle mix, had been pretty nervous, so I thought a little walk would be nice. \n\nAs we are walking, my dog suddenly stops and poops in the middle of the sidewalk. Now, this is not an ideal place for him to go, and usually he tries to find a grassy spot off to the side, but apparently he needed to go and this was where he was going. This spot he chose to go on the sidewalk happened to be a in front of a cafe (about 4 feet in front of it). I didn't think much of it, or even notice what business I was in front of. I got out a poop bag to pick it up. I picked up the poop in the dog bag and tied a knot. There was a small amount of residue that I couldn't get off of the sidewalk (not sure how to avoid that). \n\nJust as we were about to continue walking, someone pops out of the door (who I assume is the owner of the cafe) and says in a rude tone, \"This is a business, don't let your dog poop here (pointing to where the dog had pooped). He should have pooped over there (points to the curb)\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond and I think I mustered something like, \"This is a sidewalk and this is where he stopped to go.\" \n\nI didn't feel like I should apologize for anything in this situation so I did not. I was more annoyed than anything. I turned and left without further engaging with the person. I noted the shop and made a mental note to never visit it.\n\nJust for a better visual: This cafe has no outdoor seating. This is just a public sidewalk in front of their cafe that is on a pedestrian street in a big city. \n\nI am not sure what I could have done differently. I picked up the poop. The owner of the cafe didn't need to come out and say anything. They don't own the sidewalk in front of their cafe. This is NYC, we all have to share the sidewalk. \n\nWho's the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689012782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w1lo0/aita_my_dog_pooped_on_the_sidewalk_that_happened/", "score": 847, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You cleaned up after your dog. That's what NYC's current pooper-scooper law requires. The old curb your dog law was replaced because the advent of scoops and bags you could use to clean up after your dog made the idea that you need to get your dog to the curb/gutter so the weekly street cleanings could sweep it away obsolete.\n\nWith that said, if at all possible dog owners should always try to get their pets to a reasonable area to go to the bathroom for many reasons, including sanitation and not blocking pedestrian traffic, but sometimes anyone who's understanding should acknowledge that that's not always possible.", "NtA.

I was walking my dog on a commercial street filled with small businesses and shops in Queens, NY. I had just come from the vet and my dog, a beagle mix, had been pretty nervous, so I thought a little walk would be nice. \n\nAs we are walking, my dog suddenly stops and poops in the middle of the sidewalk. Now, this is not an ideal place for him to go, and usually he tries to find a grassy spot off to the side, but apparently he needed to go and this was where he was going. This spot he chose to go on the sidewalk happened to be a in front of a cafe (about 4 feet in front of it). I didn't think much of it, or even notice what business I was in front of. I got out a poop bag to pick it up. I picked up the poop in the dog bag and tied a knot. There was a small amount of residue that I couldn't get off of the sidewalk (not sure how to avoid that). \n\nJust as we were about to continue walking, someone pops out of the door (who I assume is the owner of the cafe) and says in a rude tone, \"This is a business, don't let your dog poop here (pointing to where the dog had pooped). He should have pooped over there (points to the curb)\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond and I think I mustered something like, \"This is a sidewalk and this is where he stopped to go.\" \n\nI didn't feel like I should apologize for anything in this situation so I did not. I was more annoyed than anything. I turned and left without further engaging with the person. I noted the shop and made a mental note to never visit it.\n\nJust for a better visual: This cafe has no outdoor seating. This is just a public sidewalk in front of their cafe that is on a pedestrian street in a big city. \n\nI am not sure what I could have done differently. I picked up the poop. The owner of the cafe didn't need to come out and say anything. They don't own the sidewalk in front of their cafe. This is NYC, we all have to share the sidewalk. \n\nWho's the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\nI have a nervous pooper pup. While I can usually see a turtle head situation and rush her to the side if it's not the most convenient spot (an approaching crowd, right in front of someone's mailbox, etc) sometimes those nerves hit and the poop comes out with no warning. You pick it up and you move on with your life. The residue will wash out in the next rain storm.\n\nI think back to working at the mall with a particular patron that everyone at every store knew if she comes in keep an eye on her because she will start to do the peepee dance and you have approximately 45 seconds to push her out of the store so she'll pee in front of the store and not in the store. In front of the store was tiled and the mall's responsibility whereas inside the store was carpet and I had to clean it. All this being said, I'd far rather deal with a little poop reside in the fresh of outside that a human pee puddle in an interior store. \n\nThat story has no reflection on anything, the memory was just unlocked and I needed to share.
