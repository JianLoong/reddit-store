My dog pooped on the sidewalk that happened to be in front of a cafe in NYC \u2013 Owner was not happy.", "selftext": "I just had an experience that I am not sure how to feel about. I was walking my dog on a commercial street filled with small businesses and shops in Queens, NY. I had just come from the vet and my dog, a beagle mix, had been pretty nervous, so I thought a little walk would be nice. \n\nAs we are walking, my dog suddenly stops and poops in the middle of the sidewalk. Now, this is not an ideal place for him to go, and usually he tries to find a grassy spot off to the side, but apparently he needed to go and this was where he was going. This spot he chose to go on the sidewalk happened to be a in front of a cafe (about 4 feet in front of it). I didn't think much of it, or even notice what business I was in front of. I got out a poop bag to pick it up. I picked up the poop in the dog bag and tied a knot. There was a small amount of residue that I couldn't get off of the sidewalk (not sure how to avoid that). \n\nJust as we were about to continue walking, someone pops out of the door (who I assume is the owner of the cafe) and says in a rude tone, \"This is a business, don't let your dog poop here (pointing to where the dog had pooped). He should have pooped over there (points to the curb)\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond and I think I mustered something like, \"This is a sidewalk and this is where he stopped to go.\" \n\nI didn't feel like I should apologize for anything in this situation so I did not. I was more annoyed than anything. I turned and left without further engaging with the person. I noted the shop and made a mental note to never visit it.\n\nJust for a better visual: This cafe has no outdoor seating. This is just a public sidewalk in front of their cafe that is on a pedestrian street in a big city. \n\nI am not sure what I could have done differently. I picked up the poop. The owner of the cafe didn't need to come out and say anything. They don't own the sidewalk in front of their cafe. This is NYC, we all have to share the sidewalk. \n\nWho's the asshole?", "created_utc": 1689012782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w1lo0/aita_my_dog_pooped_on_the_sidewalk_that_happened/", "score": 2532, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You cleaned up after your dog. That's what NYC's current pooper-scooper law requires. The old curb your dog law was replaced because the advent of scoops and bags you could use to clean up after your dog made the idea that you need to get your dog to the curb/gutter so the weekly street cleanings could sweep it away obsolete.\n\nWith that said, if at all possible dog owners should always try to get their pets to a reasonable area to go to the bathroom for many reasons, including sanitation and not blocking pedestrian traffic, but sometimes anyone who's understanding should acknowledge that that's not always possible.", "NtA.

I was walking my dog on a commercial street filled with small businesses and shops in Queens, NY. I had just come from the vet and my dog, a beagle mix, had been pretty nervous, so I thought a little walk would be nice. \n\nAs we are walking, my dog suddenly stops and poops in the middle of the sidewalk. Now, this is not an ideal place for him to go, and usually he tries to find a grassy spot off to the side, but apparently he needed to go and this was where he was going. This spot he chose to go on the sidewalk happened to be a in front of a cafe (about 4 feet in front of it). I didn't think much of it, or even notice what business I was in front of. I got out a poop bag to pick it up. I picked up the poop in the dog bag and tied a knot. There was a small amount of residue that I couldn't get off of the sidewalk (not sure how to avoid that). \n\nJust as we were about to continue walking, someone pops out of the door (who I assume is the owner of the cafe) and says in a rude tone, \"This is a business, don't let your dog poop here (pointing to where the dog had pooped). He should have pooped over there (points to the curb)\"\n\nI didn't know how to respond and I think I mustered something like, \"This is a sidewalk and this is where he stopped to go.\" \n\nI didn't feel like I should apologize for anything in this situation so I did not. I was more annoyed than anything. I turned and left without further engaging with the person. I noted the shop and made a mental note to never visit it.\n\nJust for a better visual: This cafe has no outdoor seating. This is just a public sidewalk in front of their cafe that is on a pedestrian street in a big city. \n\nI am not sure what I could have done differently. I picked up the poop. The owner of the cafe didn't need to come out and say anything. They don't own the sidewalk in front of their cafe. This is NYC, we all have to share the sidewalk. \n\nWho's the asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

While I can usually see a turtle head situation and rush her to the side if it's not the most convenient spot (an approaching crowd, right in front of someone's mailbox, etc) sometimes those nerves hit and the poop comes out with no warning. You pick it up and you move on with your life. The residue will wash out in the next rain storm.\n\nI think back to working at the mall with a particular patron that everyone at every store knew if she comes in keep an eye on her because she will start to do the peepee dance and you have approximately 45 seconds to push her out of the store so she'll pee in front of the store and not in the store. In front of the store was tiled and the mall's responsibility whereas inside the store was carpet and I had to clean it. All this being said, I'd far rather deal with a little poop reside in the fresh of outside that a human pee puddle in an interior store. \n\nThat story has no reflection on anything, the memory was just unlocked and I needed to share.

Not at all. \n\nThe first time I saw the pair, the dog had stopped on one of the small pieces of sidewalk on an island in the street. It was shaking like a leaf, trying to squat, poop, and do the little weird squat creep dogs do while pooping. Of course it also shat out poops that could best be described as having to consistently of not-quite-set jello.  \n\nAll the while it\u2019s owner was squatting along side the dog, with his arms in a bear hug around it, trying to keep the poor creature from collapsing and breaking a hip. \n\nDid I mention this man was in a suit?\n\nAnd then that man, bless him, would grab a poo bag and get to scooping. Just like frantically scooping. \n\nThey had a system, it was clear. But the system needed work.\n\nThat first encounter, I stood on a corner so mesmerized by this insane dance and the potential weekly cost in lint rollers and dry cleaning this man must have that I missed a walk cycle. \n\nI thought this was a one-off. Nope. Ye old geriatric dog of the concerningly soft poops and the well-dressed man did this dance every day it seems, and became a pretty regular fixture on my walk to work. \n\nAll this is to say, this man LOVED this dog.

If it's not too soft, I pick up what I can first.", "I own a store in a downtown and I previously owned a small cafe in a different downtown; I just keep a 4L jug of water by the door with a stiff broom in case that happens because I am also a dog owner and I know it happens and also know that it\u2019s almost impossible to get all of it even if it\u2019s not a squirt because the sidewalk is rough and grabs it like sandpaper\u2026", "From experience, not much you CAN do. Growing up, my family had a dog who pooped every time he got moving fast. Couldn\u2019t do anything about it but try and clean up what you can.", "I just started working in Manhattan again last year after being away for about 10 years. I've seen people shitting, changing their clothes (no underwear,  in front of a Wendy's), shooting up, you name it. This is the most minor of things I could ever imagine. \n\nFor example: I had a guy sitting next to me on the subway talking to himself while polishing a knife. I saw a homeless guy get in a fight with his own reflection (I was the only one who stayed in that car, he wasn't mad at me and I wanted a seat!). First day at my new office I had a guy shoot up next to me on my lunch break in Washington Square Park. \n\nA person cleaning up dog shit is completely fine.", "This is three from the top and only like 300-400 away from passing the next closest. So not sure what you mean by \u201cnowhere near\u201d", "Ha!  Similar situation... someone let their dog poop and didn't pick it up on the street in our little neighborhood.  HOA sent out an email reminding residents to pick up their dog's poop (not a big deal).  However, and the residents' responses were vicious... name and shame!  put up signs!  evil people from next neighborhood over!  The responses really showed the awful and presumptive side of some people, so I'm not surprised at some of the responses in this thread.\n\nThen I realized based on the incident location that it was probably my dog and I just missed it one day.  I told folks I'd pick it up and happily wear the scarlet (brown) letter if it made them feel any better as long as they did the same every time they violated some regulation.  No one said a peep after that.", "Thanks :)", "Basically any kind of tasty and maybe dangerous food sold on the street from a cart or food truck. NYC has tons of them and they all contribute to its unique aroma. I absolutely love visiting there anytime of the year. I'd highly recommend a visit :)", "100%, from how the post is written it sounds like OP wanted to get to a grassy area but little buddy had to go right there", "They don\u2019t have dogs. If they did they\u2019d understand why OP isn\u2019t the AH.", "Carry a pooper scooper too\n\n&#x200B;\n\n..... and fling it at the people who yell at you.", "OMG, the looks they give you when they're embarrassed! As a human with unpredictable IBS, you just have to roll with it and have plenty of cleaning supplies.", "My dog just got diagnosed with colitis.  He's a longhaired dachshund, so imagine a stumpy dog with thick, lustrous Fabio hair pooping with a look of immense distress.  He occasionally gets a little bit on his back legs (long hair and all) and gets so indignant when I clean him off afterwards.\n\nHe's got arthritis, so he doesn't lift his leg any more to pee.  He just leans slightly forward, lifts his tail, and lets it go.  It's hilarious, he's making the most dignified \"getting inspected by the judge at the Westminster Kennel Club dog show\" stance while pissing.", "I'm American and I think this is some petty dog shit, no pun intended.\n\nPeople here are so mean and uptight.", "As long as people pick up their dog's poop, I don't care if they go on my lawn.  I'm sure plenty of birds and squirrels and other animals have taken a dump there from time to time, it is what it is.  The ground outside isn't going to be clean like a hospital floor, that's why we wear shoes.\n\nMy dog likes to do surprise encore shits sometimes.  I learned many years ago to always carry at least 3 poop bags after a couple of humiliating incidents where my dog pooped on someone's lawn and I'd already used the dog waste bag earlier on his walk so I had to exaggeratedly mime to the scowling homeowner that I was going home to get a bag and I was not just leaving the bonus turd there.  I feel like as long as people pick up after their dog, who cares?\n\nI will say that your geese make quite a mess when they visit my part of America over the winter, lol.  But that can't be helped.  Animals are gonna go where they go, no need to freak out about it!", "not only was it an accident, they cleaned it to the best of their abilities. i\u2019ve never heard the term \u201ccurb your dog\u201d and i lived in downtown chicago. if this was intentional i\u2019d see where you\u2019re going. but it wasn\u2019t. get over yourself", "Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right, but 3 lefts do.", "It\u2019s actually crazy how okay people are with allowing their animals to shit and piss all over where people walk. Yes, NYC is dirty. And the dog shit and piss is a huge contributing factor\u2026 I\u2019ve seen dogs piss on single family or small apartment building homes in the city while their owners just watched. Sure love to sit on the stoop after that. The curb has tons of rain that washes down it and can actually clean the smell more so than on the sidewalk.", "Doubtful the guys dog meant to go there. Sometimes they can't hold it to the designated area just like some people. Y'all act like you've never had an accident.", "LoL at \"mega boomer energy\"", "I was in Amsterdam many many moons ago and I'm pretty sure they had stencils or something on the sidewalks that said \"en de goot\" or something similar meaning to have your dog shit in the gutter instead of the middle of the sidewalk. Same concept.", "Lmao I feel like most of them have never been to New York either where I\u2019m pretty sure humans crap on the sidewalk and everything already smells like garbage n pee.", "Also, there's wayyyy more bird shit on sidewalks that dog shit. As long as it wasn't a pile and just a stain, no one is going to pay much attention.", "I dunno I think the shop owner's attitude sucked, coming out yelling like he owns the sidewalk. \n\nI would've apologized if he'd been rational, but if he comes at me with that kind of BS I will give it right back to him and I've never even been a New Yorker.", "So basically, you're condoning an animal owner be unnecessarily rough with their pet and create a poop trail? Not seeing how that's better. \n\nThis is one of the things that we just have to deal with as part of having animals in our society. As long as OP is cleaning up afterwards I don't see the big deal.", "Exactly! Emergencies happen.\n\nI was at a restaurant the other day and HAD to go. We had walked there, which was a mile from home, and I called my mom at home, working out, that she had to come get me because there was no way I would make it home. I definitely used the restaurant's restroom, but even then, it was such an emergency there was no way I could have walked home without shitting in someone's yard. Shit happens... quite literally.", "SEXUALLY ASSAULTED HER??", "We have a backyard, but one morning I watched my dog take his poop, and start to try and play with our other dog, but his butt kept involuntarily hunching as he tried to walk away and he kept turning and looking at it like WTF? More poop chunks kept coming out and he finally had to stop and wait til he dropped another big log. They can\u2019t control it even if they WANT to, LMFAO.", "I think mine actively looks for the \u201cNO DOGS ON GRASS\u201d signs and decides to pop a squat right there. You\u2019d think in his old age, he\u2019d be easier to move, but no sir. He\u2019s pooping and he\u2019s pooping next to this sign he can\u2019t read.", "He would randomly lay down too! Thankfully never in a crosswalk. \ud83d\ude02 I told many a people, \"He's, okay! He just decided this was a good spot to lay down for a bit.\" \n\nI miss that derpy golden boy. He was the best.", "This is a fantastic idea, I have no idea why I\u2019ve never thought to do this. I was there with 2 bags just trying and failing to get it all \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I'll also use cat litter. Dog sat a great Dane with a stomach bug in Queens. They had a cat too so whenever I took him out on a walk for him to shit his brains out I'd bring a baggie of cat litter and a bottle of water. Cat litter to soak it up so I could pick it up, water to rinse what I couldn't grab. I'd just be standing next to a pile of liquid shit in the summer heat waiting for the litter to soak it up while the dog wondered why we weren't walking.", "Jesus Christ!? I never seen that in my years in NY and that\u2019s all 32 years of it.", "This is at 1.3k and the top comment is at 3k but ok", "who wouldn\u2019t?? having your dog poop somewhere inconvenient with people watching is embarrassing as fuck. imo as long as op picked it up, and wasn\u2019t intentionally making their dog go infront of peoples establishments, what\u2019s the big deal? it\u2019s nyc, streets are dirty as shit anyways \ud83d\ude2c", "The poop face gets me every time \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nAgreed!", "Wouldn\u2019t want dog poop in the way of the literal piles of trash on the sidewalk!", "Yeah the \u201ccurb your dog\u201d signs basically mean clean up the shit, not that your dog has to shit off the curb, most places in NYC this isn\u2019t even possible, imagine all the dog owners walking their dogs right off the curb waiting for them to shit while taxis and buses try to avoid them on a busy day in Manhattan.  Followed by plenty of horn honking and \u201cHey guy my dog is trying to take a shit heeer\u2019!  WTF!?!? $&@0&$(!@\u201c", "My last dog would take her sweet time to poop, she had to find the perfect spot where the grass wasn't too high since she hated when the grass touched her bum and she would only balance on her front two legs to do it. The hover method for dogs if you will. She was also super particular about pooping anywhere but \"her\" yard, she would hold it in until we got done her walk or were back from the park and go in the front yard as soon as we got home.\n\nOne day we were out for a walk and she just squatted out of nowhere, right in the middle of the sidewalk. I'd had her for 6 years at this point and never once had she pooped during a walk so I didn't even have proper poop bags for her. A lesson learned and with a sock gone to the dump later, I never forgot the poop bags again, and she never pooped on a walk again.", "This is a cool bit of history! Thanks for getting me to read up on this further!", "Yes :( It happens extremely often, unfortunately...", "I have a small breed dog and I still don't drag him because that's just fucking inhumane!", "OMG the imagery. I'm laughing so hard right now. LOL", "I had a dog like this. She perfected the crab walk and pooping at the same time. She was so nosy and could never take the time to just poop and then come over. So she combined it. Hilarious every time.", "Ahahahaaa this made me giggle thank you for that", "I\u2019m dying bc my old man dog client, I\u2019m a professional dog walker, also did that and I was almost peeing myself laughing at him.

He selects hones where\u2019s the owners are looking out the window as well", "Hell, even people don\u2019t always make it to where they want to to take a deuce.
