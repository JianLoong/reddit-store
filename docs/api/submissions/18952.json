None of my business and I don't ask questions but either way, she's here at least 3 nights a week now. My roommate is actually my SIL (my husband is deployed currently and I am fixing to go with him when he is permanently stationed but it'll be a bit). I have a 6yo son.\n\nNow, my son still wets the bed. He wears nighttime pull ups. The doctors have given me many possible reasons for it. ADHD, bowel obstruction (diagnosed as a baby), PTSD/nightmares (from his dad leaving to go back on deployment- he has a lot of fear) but either way, he still wets the bed. I personally don't make a fuss about it. And where I have a medical view point on it, I honestly don't try to correct it either. The doctor said it is something he will grow out of. So aside from me limiting liquid before bed and getting him up during the night, I don't do anything else. Regardless, he still wets. \n\nI do all the cleaning in the house because my roommate does 12hr overnight shifts 4 days a week. Generally she sleeps all day. So I do all cleaning anyways. I clean the bathroom trash every other day and this is where my son puts his pull ups when he changes for the day. My roommates partner approached me this morning and told me I need to start taking care of it everyday. I asked her if it smelled (I grow nose blind so I was genuinely asking) and she said \"No, it's just fucking disgusting. A 6yo should be taking care of his own piss soaked pull up every day so other people don't need to be near it.\" I told her at this point that she can fuck off. I told her that she doesn't pay rent here AND she has a bathroom directly beside my roommates bedroom so she doesn't even need to be near the main bath if it bothers her. Not only that but I won't be dictated by this woman, who doesn't lift a finger to earn her keep here to begin with. My roommate is angry. Not because of the pull ups (she said she doesn't see an issue) but because I made this woman feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.

It would be fine for someone to comment that they might be removed from the apartment more regularly, since nose blindness is a thing, and they do begin to smell quite quickly.

One of mine wet to bed until he was 11 (some ND kids can have those kinds of issues) - And the only opinion you want on this issue  is the medical one, not some random stranger, who happens to be semi-living for free in the place you are paying for.
