As someone nearly 3x your age, who was addicted to cigarettes for most of my adult life, starting when I was \"around your age\", I actually LOL'ed at that. You seem to think that because someone else drew an equally arbitrary legal line (that they had to, because they had to pick a legal age) deciding that 18 would be the age of legal majority (and NO, contrary to Reddit's popular understanding, that does NOT mean that 18-year-olds are \"adults\"), that it means that being 18 makes you mature and able to make sensible adult decisions. That's . . . debatable. But even if we assumed it were true, it would literally mean that you were *actively choosing to ignore that people younger than you are NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DO THE SAME*. Yes, even people \"around your age\". That you having just barely teetered over that legal line suggests that the kids on the other side of it still have more growing and maturing to do.

You\u2019re selling cigarettes to underage kids (contributing to the delinquency of minors) and you have the audacity to try to exert control over others? If you cared so much about not wanting to be the reason young people start smoking -\nStop providing them with cigs.\n\nI guess you can sell to whomever you want but you\u2019ve got to accept the risks and be willing to accept the consequences of getting busted.\n\nGet a new side gig", "I don\u2019t even have to read this to know YTA the first line is enough, stop selling cigarettes to children you weirdo", "YTA. selling cigarettes to children!!! 14-16 yo???

I'm guessing you're UK, as this is common in all schools here. But you are showing some redemption as you refuse to sell as she is smoking more and more. There are lots of other ways to make a few quid at school, I had plenty of side hustles, such as mass-buying sweets, bagging them up and selling them to the younger kids, whilst undercutting the rip-off tuck shop. The chances are if you stop selling them they'll get them from someone else, or there's bound to be a couple of shops that will sell them, and they won't rat you out. But if she does just don't have any on you and deny it.", "you know you're committing a felony right? Actually, many felonies. Selling cigarettes to literal children is just the worst one.

But I guess if you insist on being an adult, that's fine since legally, yeah you are an adult. In other words, you're that creepy older guy you think you aren't. You can legally buy cigs.
