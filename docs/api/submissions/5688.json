They left around 6pm, so all I had to do was watch a movie with the kids, and then put them to bed. I decided to watch Polar Express with them. All went well, they were very excited about the movie, but I figured that was just kids being excited.\n\nFast forward to Christmas. I got a frantic call from my brother, yelling at me for showing the kids that movie. I didn\u2019t know this, but apparently, there is a set of train tracks that run behind their house (about 200 yards back) and on Christmas Eve, my nieces had snuck out of bed and walked out to them to \u201cwait for the polar express\u201d. My brother put them to bed around 10, and found them at 6am unwrapping presents under the tree. He realized they\u2019d been outside because their coats/boots were strewn about the hallway, and their faces were pink from having been out in the cold. They don\u2019t know how long the kids were out there (doctor estimated about 1.5 hours), and took them to the ER because my younger nieces lips were blue and she was stumbling, where they found out that my younger niece had (thankfully mild) hypothermia. \n\nMy brother is beyond angry at me. He says I\u2019m irresponsible and an awful babysitter, and that I should\u2019ve explained to them that the Polar Express isn\u2019t real. The girls could\u2019ve gotten seriously injured or killed, and he completely blames me. He refused to bring the kids to my parents house for Christmas, which really upset my parents. He\u2019s refusing to speak to me, and says he\u2019s never going to let me see the kids again since I\u2019m irresponsible and could\u2019ve gotten them killed.\n\nI feel really awful about it, but at the same time, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault. They recently moved to this house, and I\u2019ve never visited before Christmas Eve since I live in the city and they\u2019re about two hours away. So I\u2019ve never seen the house in daylight, and had no idea there were train tracks near it. It never occurred to me to say that the movie wasn\u2019t real, all the kids still believe in Santa, so I didn\u2019t think there was any harm in showing them a Christmas movie. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten mixed reactions from people. My husband says it\u2019s not my fault, and it\u2019s completely on them, as does my father and sister, but my brother and my mom think I\u2019m the worst person in the world. I feel really awful, and don\u2019t know what to do.

They were all over town, etc. The fact that it wasn't pounded into their heads you never go to them is mind blowing to me. I remember in school before we watched the movie, we had a teacher explain to us the dangers of rail roads. My parents once we moved near the tracks had a long talk with me, why we don't go near them, etc. The fact that it's behind their house and their parents didn't have that talk??

It shouldn't have been on you to talk about movies not being real, it should have been on him to teach his children to never go outside a) in the dark b) without an adult c) without parental permission d) all of the above. Not to mention teaching them to go nowhere near TRAIN TRACKS, for heaven's sake. \n\nI guess try to cut your brother some slack for the horrifying time they just had during the holidays...

I cannot imagine having a house that close to train tracks without some sort of security alarm, at least a bell that goes off when a door is opened.

That means security systems and sleeping lighter because I'm responsible for them. That's just basic parenting. \n\nAccidents still happen, and kids find ways to do stupid and dangerous things, and by the grace of God, they still come through. It's still my failure and my fault because I'm the parent, and it's my job to know where they are and be sure they're safe. \n\nOP, you are absolutely not to blame for this. You showed them a totally appropriate movie and took care of them. Please don't take on a burden of guilt for this; it's not yours to carry.\n\nNow may I suggest you extend a little grace to your brother? If I were him, I'd be overcome with guilt and horror at all the ways this could have ended tragically. He's probably still processing it and sadly chose to lash out in response. Give him a chance to calm down and see if he's more rational in a day or two.

His 4,6 and 7 year old managed to get out of the house and STAY outside for 1.5 hours without mom and dad knowing!? It doesn\u2019t matter why or where they were going.

If they had watched \"Frozen\", then run out in the snow to find Elsa, would that have also been your fault? \n\nI think your brother was (understandably) very shaken by the experience; it could've easily ended tragically.

That is 100% on him.", "NTA.  Where were they when their kids left the house?  Seriously, a board creaks (especially on Christmas eve) and my husband and I bolt from the bed... and I'm typically a deep sleeper.  Sounds like they'd been drinking and slept too soundly.  I think they are projecting their own guilt onto you!  You did nothing wrong!", "NTA \n\nHow is it your fault your brother cannot keep an eye on his own kids - most parents would notice if their three children under the age of 10 snuck out of the house. What were the parents doing?", "NTA in any way. Your brother is the parent and needs to talk to his kids about train safety, especially with the tracks being so close to their house. If you showed them Snow White would he blame you when they wandered into the woods looking for dwarves?", "NTA.

His taking it out on yogis abusive.", "So.... you're at fault for letting them see a cartoon but he's not responsible for his children sneaking out of the house. Make sure they don't see Up and try and get their house to float away.\n\nNTA", "NTA and there is no way you could\u2019ve known that his kids would sneak out. It\u2019s perfectly innocent holiday film. How your brother and his wife didn\u2019t hear their kids sneak out is weird. I think your brother is deflecting and I hope he apologizes to you once he realizes he was in the wrong. You did nothing wrong.", "No. It\u2019s your brother\u2019s responsibility to supervise his kids.  Movies are nothing to do with kids. It\u2019s about control, responsibility, and communication.  Your brother failed at that. \n\nNTA\n\nBy the way, I suggest you to put CPS number in your phone in case if your brother is not responsible.", "NTA. I live near train tracks. This was the first year I showed my 5!!!!!!!!! year old that movie. Not once did he try to sneak outside because we've taught him since he was old enough to walk to never ever ever go out the doors without an adult. And we also installed locks he couldn't reach AND couldn't figure out how to open. Your brother is supremely pissed at himself because I'm going to guarantee this ISNT the first time their kids have gone out the door by themselves for whatever reason. Dad hasn't made it clear to them how dangerous it can be. I highly doubt the one with blue lips will try this again as she learned that going out the door without an adult resulted in a hospital visit that could've been much much worse. Both kids need to be sat down and taught why going outside without an adult at their age is a bad idea. Don't sweat this OP, dad just got a huge reality check and he's looking for a way to blow off steam.", "Nta, there are an infinite number of things kids can extract from children\u2019s movies and potentially hurt themselves trying to reenact. You can\u2019t address every single aspect of every fiction and babysplain that it\u2019s dangerous, his kids escaped on his watch. That\u2019s on him. I was taught not to leave the house at night or without my parents when I was little- I even \u201cran away\u201d once when I was that young, and literally walked the perimeter of our back yard with my backpack because it was so engrained in me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave on my own lol.", "NTA. Most kids that age (certainly the older two) know that animated movies aren't real. Would they also have gone out searching for Whoville if they'd seen The Grinch (and does that mean you shouldn't let little kids watch it)?", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ll cut your brother some slack and assume he apologizes after he calms down. It probably scared the crap out of him when he realized his kids were playing on a railroad track.", "NTA\nYour brother is an irresponsible parent.", "NTA. Wha?!?!", "Screw this. That\u2019s 100% parenting. 0% babysitting.", "NTA. They didn\u2019t have tickets so they couldn\u2019t have boarded anyway. Seriously, though, your brother and his wife sound like they wanted someone else to take the responsibility for them not being aware their children had left the house. You were not there when they left. How come no one heard them leave? Kids are not quiet.", "NTA - your brother is being a delusional a\\*\\*hole.  It is not your fault that the kids left his house during the night.   His house has terrible security if 3 kids could get outside during the night without him knowing.  He needs a lesson in home security.", "I show that movie every year as do 1000s of people. Grapevine even plays it on a big screen for kids to watch in pj's. It's not your fault nor your job to tell his kids it's a movie and not real. If this mentality is correct, then no one should watch any movies because kids might go and do the behaviors portrayed. Some do, but again, that's on the parents to prevent that. I'm sorry they did that, but again, it's a movie, and they should have been watching and listening to the kids better. \n\nNTA \nDon't babysit again, and if they ask say no.", "He's a bad parent and is projecting that onto you\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\n\nYou're being blamed for showing the kids a movie. Blame the parents for not being aware that their kids snuck out of the house for EIGHT HOURS. Your brother is ridiculous", "NTA. I live near train tracks. I asked my 4 year old about this and she was horrified. SHE WOULD NEVER.", "Your brother allowed his small children to leave his home, completely unnoticed, for 1.5 hours and he thinks you\u2019re the AH? Seriously? If my home is quiet for more than 5 minutes I get concerned (regarding my kids whereabouts). He sounds frustrated and he\u2019s taking it out on you. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA at all but dad & mom not hearing their own kids leaving the house?? I mean if they can't hear that, that means they can't hear someone breaking in/taking their kids, mom & dad need to do better a lot better", "His kids were outdoors without his knowledge for around 1.5hrs but its apparently your fault?!\nHe's angry at the wrong person.. You're definitely NTA", "NTA, but a mild one for your brother for blaming you for his parenting failure, plus a gigantic one for your mom taking his side.", "NTA. I think I would be more worried about my kids being able to leave the house on their own withouth me or my partner knowing. Not you fault they are heavy sleepers or doesnt have a really good house security.", "NTA. Who could predict that the kids would have gone to the tracks near their house at 0-dark-whenever? And how is it that 5, 6, and 7 year-olds can sneak out and wander off? \n\nYour brother needs to child-proof his doors now.", "YTA for showing them Polar Express. That movie is creepy af, so much uncanny valley. Infamously terrifying. I\u2019m not surprised the glazed eyes of the main cast motivated the children to try and jump on the tracks. Of course it was that movie.", "NTA. They\u2019re just looking for someone to blame because they don\u2019t want to blame themselves.", "NTA, what kind of dumbass logic is your brother using? Ask him if you would be at fault if you showed them Frosty and the kids stayed outside all morning trying to wish a snowman to life?\n\nKids are kids and sometimes they do stupid things because their mind isn't fully formed yet", "NTA. Why was outside accessible to the kids at night? That's on the parents not you. I really feel like the issue isn't even theories so much as the fact that the kids can get out of the house so easily without anyone noticing", "He can't keep an eye on his kids and it's your fault? NTA", "INFO:  Did you bring the movie with you OR was it already in the House.\n\nOP=NTA either way, but it does make the accusation more ridiculous if the movie was already in the house.\n\nIt's a child's movie and you showed them a child's movie(that you had not be told NOT to show them).", "NTA. Omg. My youngest son loves that movie. Every year we go to the theater to watch it. We also have trains and never have they done this.  How would you know? We also made sure our doors were secured against little people trying to escape.", "NTA - sounds like he is just transferring it to you so that he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s to blame. Everything he is saying to you is actually how he should feel about himself. \n\nThey are HIS children and under HIS supervision they managed to get out of bed and outside and at train tracks. \n\nOtherwise I\u2019m guessing he doesn\u2019t let them watch any kids films because most of them are based on situations that would be dangerous in real life.", "NAH - for now.\n\nOf course you couldn't predict that would happen!  \n\nI'll tell you a story though.  After being poked and shoved by my brother for minutes when we were little, I finally shoved back.  Unfortunately, he hit his head against the edge of a coffee table.  My Dad's first reaction after confirming he was okay was to smack me.  Was it fair?  I still don't think so.  But he got scared.  People lose judgement when they're frightened for their children.  My Dad did other things I still blame him for, but that isn't one of them.\n\nYour brother will only become an AH if he doesn't come around.  Give him a little time to calm down and come to his senses that you couldn't have known you were setting that scenario up.", "NTA *at all*. Not trying to sound like a dick, but what kind of parent is your brother that his kids would even behave that way? Even at 6 or 7, I knew my mother would have my ass if I left the house without her  - *especially* at night and *especially especially* in the cold. And that's not even getting into the fact that they started opening their presents without their parents. Either he's raising a couple dummies or he's failed to instill basic safety rules and expectations. Either way, all you did was watch a children's movie with the children. You did *nothing* wrong and he's just lashing out at you because it's hard to be mad at little kids for acting stupid and the alternative would be to examine his own parenting. Your mom is just going with your brother's anger, but nobody else around you seems to agree with him. He's acting like an ass.", "Although this movie is disturbing due to its macabre CGI, NTA is only taking its blame off on you. If it were you, I would take advantage of not having contact with your brother because at the very least something happens, he will throw you in the middle and blame you.", "NTA. It's utterly unfair to blame you and deep down he probably knows that. I'm sure that it's more about not wanting to accept responsibility than it is about the movie.\n\nYou could literally have shown them any movie and they could have tried to replicate something dangerous out of it. \n\nI'm more concerned that the children were able to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night and no one noticed until morning.", "NTA, this was not a malicious act. You had no idea that they would react this way. He needs to chill.", "NTA your brother and mom are unhinged.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your fault at all. You didn\u2019t tell the kids to go out in the middle of the night and stand by train tracks. You showed them a CHILDRENS movie. Your brother is insane. Hell, if showing kids a children\u2019s movie or getting them toys is \u201ctelling the kids doing bad/dangerous things is ok,\u201d I should be in prison for all the dragons and action figures I\u2019ve given to my 4 and 5 year old nephews! And besides, does he not know how to LOCK THE DOORS TO THE DAMN HOUSE?! Have the locks out of childrens reach so they CANT OPEN THE DOORS!!!!! Wtf is his problem?!", "NAH, this happened yesterday right? This sounds absolutely terrifying. It\u2019s not your fault, but your brother might have to calm down from his kids nearly dying and then spending Christmas in the ER.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault. Kids that are age are suggestible and excitable. We send them really conflicting messages this time of year. Take care of yourself and give your brother some time to cool off.", "People who get caught in embarrassing situations such as *not knowing their children let themselves outside in the freezing cold on Christmas Day* will often cast about looking for someone else to blame. \n\nIt speaks very poorly to the character of these parents. \n\nNTA", "NTA - they're the parents here, and the kids snuck out on THEIR watch. Your brother is desperately looking for anyone to blame but himself.", "Exactly and for that matter how exactly did they get out of the house undetected in the middle of the night and presumably out of the garden and any where near the train tracks in the first place?! This is beyond irresponsible of him and his wife.", "Yeah this is crazy. The kids snuck out, okay they should not have and it wasn\u2019t even really anyone\u2019s *fault* but instead of the brother realizing that he needs to have the \u2018real vs make believe\u2019 talk and also get a damn chain for the door or something he\u2019s just blaming OP and lashing out", "True.\n\nI have cousins who are around 8, I think even they know not to leave the house unsupervised or without telling anyone, especially since they're old enough to be able to open/unlock doors.", "I also can't believe the city doesn't have those tracks fenced in. There are tracks less than 10ft from my house and it's impossible to get onto them for kids.", "Ha! I literally laughed out loud.", "Brave Heart.", "Only the girls did, they share a room and didn\u2019t go wake up their brother. I\u2019m surprised too, I get that he thought they were asleep, but I can\u2019t imagine that a 6 and 7 year old were quiet while getting their gear out/on", "Exactly that. A four year old doing it on his own would be terrifying and unexpected, but six and seven? Super concerning that they don\u2019t have a grasp of the basic security rules at that age.", "This is exactly it. Brother is refusing to be accountable and instead is pushing blame onto OP. That is despicable and also will do his kids no good as they grow older. A 7yo should know better than to go outside without a parent at night, he needs to do better in educating his children, and better in monitoring their whereabouts.", "Yes this. NTA", "Yea seems to be misplaced guilt. Scary situations with your own children are emotional. Hopefully, he will come to his senses and realize that he owes OP a major apology.", "The same thing could have happened of her looking for frosty out in the snow. Like there so many scenarios that could have lead her to go outside", "Next time they're going to hike to the North Pole!", "Just think about the possibilities of watching Home Alone \ud83e\udd73", "You keep saying this, but this is the kind of thing parents learn to listen for in their sleep. It\u2019s why sleep quality for parents is so poor - we wake up for just about any little noise, just in case. If your brother and SIL are such heavy sleepers that they cannot hear the children creeping around in the night, they need to add alarms or monitors, or something - because it is not just going outside that can be harmful. The kids could be eating and drinking things they shouldn\u2019t, climbing furniture dangerously, etc. \n\nMy sister and I used to get up in the night and do all kinds of stuff and our parents always heard us and made us go back to bed. We only got away with shenanigans when we learned to just stay in our room, which was too far from their bedroom to hear any but the loudest noises.", "This is so not your fault. I mean would they yell at you let them watch Superman then jumped off a roof trying to fly?!? How were you supposed to foresee this happening? Also at 6 & 7 they should know that movies aren\u2019t real.", "NTA You did fine OP, you can predict everything that is going to happen,", ">Ah look. That's no excuse. I have three kids. Believe me, I would hear them if they tried to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night. If anyone is at fault for this it's the parents, definitely not you.\n\nI think OP is NTA, but I'm surprised you don't think your kids could sneak out quietly. My 8yo could definitely open her door, tiptoe downstairs, unlock the doors, and go outside without anyone waking up. That sequence of events is no noisier than a nighttime bathroom visit.", "I had no idea that mild hypothermia was a big deal."]}
