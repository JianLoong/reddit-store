{"id": 5688, "submission_id": "zvp4zt", "title": "AITA for showing my nieces and nephew Polar Express?", "selftext": "Throwaway because i don\u2019t really use Reddit much, this was my husbands idea.\n\nI (F29) babysat my nieces and nephew (M4, F6 and F7) the day before Christmas Eve so that my brother and his wife could go to a nice dinner. They left around 6pm, so all I had to do was watch a movie with the kids, and then put them to bed. I decided to watch Polar Express with them. All went well, they were very excited about the movie, but I figured that was just kids being excited.\n\nFast forward to Christmas. I got a frantic call from my brother, yelling at me for showing the kids that movie. I didn\u2019t know this, but apparently, there is a set of train tracks that run behind their house (about 200 yards back) and on Christmas Eve, my nieces had snuck out of bed and walked out to them to \u201cwait for the polar express\u201d. My brother put them to bed around 10, and found them at 6am unwrapping presents under the tree. He realized they\u2019d been outside because their coats/boots were strewn about the hallway, and their faces were pink from having been out in the cold. They don\u2019t know how long the kids were out there (doctor estimated about 1.5 hours), and took them to the ER because my younger nieces lips were blue and she was stumbling, where they found out that my younger niece had (thankfully mild) hypothermia. \n\nMy brother is beyond angry at me. He says I\u2019m irresponsible and an awful babysitter, and that I should\u2019ve explained to them that the Polar Express isn\u2019t real. The girls could\u2019ve gotten seriously injured or killed, and he completely blames me. He refused to bring the kids to my parents house for Christmas, which really upset my parents. He\u2019s refusing to speak to me, and says he\u2019s never going to let me see the kids again since I\u2019m irresponsible and could\u2019ve gotten them killed.\n\nI feel really awful about it, but at the same time, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault. They recently moved to this house, and I\u2019ve never visited before Christmas Eve since I live in the city and they\u2019re about two hours away. So I\u2019ve never seen the house in daylight, and had no idea there were train tracks near it. It never occurred to me to say that the movie wasn\u2019t real, all the kids still believe in Santa, so I didn\u2019t think there was any harm in showing them a Christmas movie. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten mixed reactions from people. My husband says it\u2019s not my fault, and it\u2019s completely on them, as does my father and sister, but my brother and my mom think I\u2019m the worst person in the world. I feel really awful, and don\u2019t know what to do.

It's a children's movie and tons of children, many of whom live near train tracks, watch it every year. It's his job to supervise his own kids.", "NTA\n\nI grew up in a town heavily filled with train tracks. Like, we had them near our house as well. They were all over town, etc. The fact that it wasn't pounded into their heads you never go to them is mind blowing to me. I remember in school before we watched the movie, we had a teacher explain to us the dangers of rail roads. My parents once we moved near the tracks had a long talk with me, why we don't go near them, etc. The fact that it's behind their house and their parents didn't have that talk?? I'm concerned for them", "NTA\n\nYour brother blames you because he doesn't want to accept that he's responsible. His kids snuck out of the house while he and his wife were responsible for them. *That's on them.*\n\nParents are responsible for teaching their children about the dangers of leaving the house unsupervised, and for train track safety. Parents are responsible for making sure their children know the difference between fact and fiction. Parents are responsible for communicating restrictions to babysitters.\n\nYou played an age appropriate Christmas movie. That's your only part in this. This is *not* your fault.", "NTA - they're the parents here, and the kids snuck out on THEIR watch. Your brother is desperately looking for anyone to blame but himself. It shouldn't have been on you to talk about movies not being real, it should have been on him to teach his children to never go outside a) in the dark b) without an adult c) without parental permission d) all of the above. Not to mention teaching them to go nowhere near TRAIN TRACKS, for heaven's sake. \n\nI guess try to cut your brother some slack for the horrifying time they just had during the holidays... But he owes you a major apology as soon as he gets his head on straight. As does your mother.", "NTA. I\u2019m trying to figure out how any person would have anticipated that the kids would do what they did.", "Seriously? How is that your fault. They should have already talked to their kids about not going near train tracks. \n\nNTA", "NTA...You sowing an age appropriate film has nothing to do with your brother not noticing when his children leave the house. Your family need to stop passing blame and start thinking about child safety.", "NTA. Whatever happened to the notion that parents should be watching their children, making sure they don't come in harm's way? Mind you, I haven't seen that film, but I cannot imagine that a film could kill children.", "NTA, it's an age appropriate Christmas movie, and unless your brother has specifically asked that you run movies by him before showing them to his kids for some reason, there's no reason you shouldn't watch polar express with them", "NTA your brother is over reacting, it\u2019s not your fault that he can\u2019t keep his kids indoors", "NTA. I cannot imagine having a house that close to train tracks without some sort of security alarm, at least a bell that goes off when a door is opened. Just like you\u2019d want if you had a swimming pool. This is on the parents for not keeping their kids safe and secure in the home.", "How did they not hear the kids leave the house? How did they not notice they were gone? Your brother is deflecting from his own guilt and looking for someone to blame.

If you'd read them Hansel and Gretel, would it have been your fault if they'd gone out looking for a life-size gingerbread house? If you'd played hide-and-seek, would it have been your fault if the kids several days later had hidden in a dangerous spot for an extended length of time?\n\nExactly what stories/movies/games does your brother think are acceptable activities for young children that have no risk of giving them dangerously dumb inspirations? \n\nNTA. Your brother was scared and is lashing out for someone to blame. But there was no reason to think that the Polar Express was a dangerous/inappropriate movie to watch.", "This is in no possible way your fault. You had no way of knowing that there were train tracks there, and you *certainly* had no way of knowing your niblings would sneak out to try to find it. Your brother is overreacting (albeit understandably, because that is a terrifying situation) but its not your fault.

You\u2019re NTA", "NTA; I grew up near train tracks, it\u2019s the parents responsibility to teach their kids dangers; you didn\u2019t know they even existed, you just wanted to show them a popular holiday movie. There was no way for you to know something like this could happen.", "NTA-  I think this is similar to people I know with small kids and pools in their yards.  If you live near\na potential hazard it is up to the parents to put in the best safety precautions possible to protect your kids from potential known risks.\n\nIf he had a pool would he blame you if the kids snuck out because you watched a swimming competition on tv with the kids?\n\nWhile I understand that yes this is unfortunate and scary I think he is probably in panic mode but also mad at himself this happening while he was there. \n\nI would let him get over the shock of what could have happened and then speak.

What kind of parents are they that all their kids manage to leave the house in the middle of the night?!\n\nIf it were me in his situation, I\u2019d have found it funny (ok maybe not with hypothermic kids). But, I\u2019d have guilt-tripped the kids by telling them the train only comes if they don\u2019t believe in Santa. And they wouldn\u2019t want to hurt Santa by not believing in him would they?", "NTA. \n\nI have a handful of kids-- youngest is 8. \n\nIf my kids got out of the house at any time of day or night without my knowing, it's MY failure and MY fault. \n\nIf they're wandering around underdressed in the cold (-7deg F here today), it's MY failure and MY fault. \n\nIf they're playing near railroad tracks, it's MY failure and MY fault. \n\nIt's all on me because I'm the parent and they're under my care. That means security systems and sleeping lighter because I'm responsible for them. That's just basic parenting. \n\nAccidents still happen, and kids find ways to do stupid and dangerous things, and by the grace of God, they still come through. It's still my failure and my fault because I'm the parent, and it's my job to know where they are and be sure they're safe. \n\nOP, you are absolutely not to blame for this. You showed them a totally appropriate movie and took care of them. Please don't take on a burden of guilt for this; it's not yours to carry.\n\nNow may I suggest you extend a little grace to your brother? If I were him, I'd be overcome with guilt and horror at all the ways this could have ended tragically. He's probably still processing it and sadly chose to lash out in response. Give him a chance to calm down and see if he's more rational in a day or two. I don't know if he's the type to apologize in word or deed, or the type to hold onto this like a grudge, but I hope he'll have a little more common sense when he finishes processing everything.", "NTA and not you fault.", "NTA. His 4,6 and 7 year old managed to get out of the house and STAY outside for 1.5 hours without mom and dad knowing!? It doesn\u2019t matter why or where they were going. The fact that a situation could exist when their 3 small kids could and would go outside alone and stay there undetected for 1.5 hours is insanity. That\u2019s 100% a failure on your brother\u2019s part and sounds like he\u2019s deflecting onto you to avoid facing the reality that his kids could\u2019ve been seriously injured due to he and his wife not properly securing their house.", "NTA. If they had watched \"Frozen\", then run out in the snow to find Elsa, would that have also been your fault? \n\nI think your brother was (understandably) very shaken by the experience; it could've easily ended tragically. And he's projecting this fear onto you. \n\nNext time you babysit, watch the movie \"Orphan\" with the kids. It's the feel-good movie of the year; l give it two thumbs up.", "NTA \n\nMom of 5 kids ranging in age from 6 to 25.  All of them have seen polar express many times (in fact most schools have \"polar express day leading up to the holidays and show the movie) and exactly ZERO of my kids have LEFT THE HOUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. \n\nThat's on him. That is 100% on him.", "NTA.  Where were they when their kids left the house?  Seriously, a board creaks (especially on Christmas eve) and my husband and I bolt from the bed... and I'm typically a deep sleeper.  Sounds like they'd been drinking and slept too soundly.  I think they are projecting their own guilt onto you!  You did nothing wrong!", "NTA \n\nHow is it your fault your brother cannot keep an eye on his own kids - most parents would notice if their three children under the age of 10 snuck out of the house. What were the parents doing?", "NTA in any way. Your brother is the parent and needs to talk to his kids about train safety, especially with the tracks being so close to their house. If you showed them Snow White would he blame you when they wandered into the woods looking for dwarves?", "NTA. Your brother is an idiot and, while there is still hope since they are very young, your niblings aren\u2019t showing a lot of promise at the moment, either.", "NTA.\n\nJesus! They are the irresponsible ones for not realizing their kids run away in the middle of the night. Don\u2019t they lock their house?\n\nI have a 2.5 yo girl and since she can reach the door we always make sure it\u2019s locked coz it takes a minute for something to go wrong.\n\nI can only give them the benefit of shock but still, they should realize it\u2019s their freaking responsibility to provide a safe environment for their kids when home with them. \n\nAnd just because I can\u2019t wrap my head around this\u2026. is there a chance they simply went out and left the kids home alone in bed? So they missed the whole sneaking away and only found out next morning?", "NAH you obviously had no idea that a simple movie would do this and your brother is freaking out because his kids got seriously hurt.

When I'm telling her to stop doing something because it's unsafe, and she gets annoyed, I ask her \"What is Mommy's number one job?\" Her response \"To keep me healthy and safe.\" I have drilled this into her for years because she's not a rule follower by nature, but there are times I simply need her to follow the rules.  \n\nAlso, I've had relatives babysit and show her movies that I didn't love, but it's then my job to tell her about that if I choose.
