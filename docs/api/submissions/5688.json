They left around 6pm, so all I had to do was watch a movie with the kids, and then put them to bed. I decided to watch Polar Express with them. All went well, they were very excited about the movie, but I figured that was just kids being excited.\n\nFast forward to Christmas. I got a frantic call from my brother, yelling at me for showing the kids that movie. I didn\u2019t know this, but apparently, there is a set of train tracks that run behind their house (about 200 yards back) and on Christmas Eve, my nieces had snuck out of bed and walked out to them to \u201cwait for the polar express\u201d. My brother put them to bed around 10, and found them at 6am unwrapping presents under the tree. He realized they\u2019d been outside because their coats/boots were strewn about the hallway, and their faces were pink from having been out in the cold. They don\u2019t know how long the kids were out there (doctor estimated about 1.5 hours), and took them to the ER because my younger nieces lips were blue and she was stumbling, where they found out that my younger niece had (thankfully mild) hypothermia. \n\nMy brother is beyond angry at me. He says I\u2019m irresponsible and an awful babysitter, and that I should\u2019ve explained to them that the Polar Express isn\u2019t real. The girls could\u2019ve gotten seriously injured or killed, and he completely blames me. He refused to bring the kids to my parents house for Christmas, which really upset my parents. He\u2019s refusing to speak to me, and says he\u2019s never going to let me see the kids again since I\u2019m irresponsible and could\u2019ve gotten them killed.\n\nI feel really awful about it, but at the same time, I really don\u2019t think it\u2019s my fault. They recently moved to this house, and I\u2019ve never visited before Christmas Eve since I live in the city and they\u2019re about two hours away. So I\u2019ve never seen the house in daylight, and had no idea there were train tracks near it. It never occurred to me to say that the movie wasn\u2019t real, all the kids still believe in Santa, so I didn\u2019t think there was any harm in showing them a Christmas movie. \n\nI\u2019ve gotten mixed reactions from people. My husband says it\u2019s not my fault, and it\u2019s completely on them, as does my father and sister, but my brother and my mom think I\u2019m the worst person in the world. I feel really awful, and don\u2019t know what to do.

They were all over town, etc. The fact that it wasn't pounded into their heads you never go to them is mind blowing to me. I remember in school before we watched the movie, we had a teacher explain to us the dangers of rail roads. My parents once we moved near the tracks had a long talk with me, why we don't go near them, etc. The fact that it's behind their house and their parents didn't have that talk?? I'm concerned for them", "NTA\n\nYour brother blames you because he doesn't want to accept that he's responsible. His kids snuck out of the house while he and his wife were responsible for them. *That's on them.*\n\nParents are responsible for teaching their children about the dangers of leaving the house unsupervised, and for train track safety.

It shouldn't have been on you to talk about movies not being real, it should have been on him to teach his children to never go outside a) in the dark b) without an adult c) without parental permission d) all of the above. Not to mention teaching them to go nowhere near TRAIN TRACKS, for heaven's sake. \n\nI guess try to cut your brother some slack for the horrifying time they just had during the holidays...

I cannot imagine having a house that close to train tracks without some sort of security alarm, at least a bell that goes off when a door is opened.

That means security systems and sleeping lighter because I'm responsible for them. That's just basic parenting. \n\nAccidents still happen, and kids find ways to do stupid and dangerous things, and by the grace of God, they still come through. It's still my failure and my fault because I'm the parent, and it's my job to know where they are and be sure they're safe. \n\nOP, you are absolutely not to blame for this. You showed them a totally appropriate movie and took care of them. Please don't take on a burden of guilt for this; it's not yours to carry.\n\nNow may I suggest you extend a little grace to your brother? If I were him, I'd be overcome with guilt and horror at all the ways this could have ended tragically. He's probably still processing it and sadly chose to lash out in response. Give him a chance to calm down and see if he's more rational in a day or two. I don't know if he's the type to apologize in word or deed, or the type to hold onto this like a grudge, but I hope he'll have a little more common sense when he finishes processing everything.", "NTA and not you fault.", "NTA. His 4,6 and 7 year old managed to get out of the house and STAY outside for 1.5 hours without mom and dad knowing!? It doesn\u2019t matter why or where they were going. The fact that a situation could exist when their 3 small kids could and would go outside alone and stay there undetected for 1.5 hours is insanity.

If they had watched \"Frozen\", then run out in the snow to find Elsa, would that have also been your fault? \n\nI think your brother was (understandably) very shaken by the experience; it could've easily ended tragically.

That is 100% on him.", "NTA.  Where were they when their kids left the house?  Seriously, a board creaks (especially on Christmas eve) and my husband and I bolt from the bed... and I'm typically a deep sleeper.  Sounds like they'd been drinking and slept too soundly.  I think they are projecting their own guilt onto you!  You did nothing wrong!", "NTA \n\nHow is it your fault your brother cannot keep an eye on his own kids - most parents would notice if their three children under the age of 10 snuck out of the house. What were the parents doing?", "NTA in any way. Your brother is the parent and needs to talk to his kids about train safety, especially with the tracks being so close to their house. If you showed them Snow White would he blame you when they wandered into the woods looking for dwarves?", "NTA. Your brother is an idiot and, while there is still hope since they are very young, your niblings aren\u2019t showing a lot of promise at the moment, either.", "NTA.\n\nJesus!

Not once did he try to sneak outside because we've taught him since he was old enough to walk to never ever ever go out the doors without an adult. And we also installed locks he couldn't reach AND couldn't figure out how to open. Your brother is supremely pissed at himself because I'm going to guarantee this ISNT the first time their kids have gone out the door by themselves for whatever reason. Dad hasn't made it clear to them how dangerous it can be. I highly doubt the one with blue lips will try this again as she learned that going out the door without an adult resulted in a hospital visit that could've been much much worse. Both kids need to be sat down and taught why going outside without an adult at their age is a bad idea. Don't sweat this OP, dad just got a huge reality check and he's looking for a way to blow off steam.", "Nta, there are an infinite number of things kids can extract from children\u2019s movies and potentially hurt themselves trying to reenact.

I was taught not to leave the house at night or without my parents when I was little- I even \u201cran away\u201d once when I was that young, and literally walked the perimeter of our back yard with my backpack because it was so engrained in me that I wasn\u2019t allowed to leave on my own lol.", "NTA.

After being poked and shoved by my brother for minutes when we were little, I finally shoved back.  Unfortunately, he hit his head against the edge of a coffee table.  My Dad's first reaction after confirming he was okay was to smack me.  Was it fair?  I still don't think so.  But he got scared.  People lose judgement when they're frightened for their children.

And that's not even getting into the fact that they started opening their presents without their parents. These kids are *wildly* undisciplined. Either he's raising a couple dummies or he's failed to instill basic safety rules and expectations. Either way, all you did was watch a children's movie with the children. You did *nothing* wrong and he's just lashing out at you because it's hard to be mad at little kids for acting stupid and the alternative would be to examine his own parenting.

It's utterly unfair to blame you and deep down he probably knows that.
