But the entitlement that she just gets to show up and you should be happy is presumptuous on her part! Don't feel bad for your feelings , if you decide to have a relationship with her in the future , it should be in your time at your own leisure.

That's already more effort than about anyone else posting put in today.", "Nta. You were unwanted and it took her 18 years to reach out to you, as someone else pointed out. As someone also pointed out to you, she probably did you a favor by not being around and possibly turning into an abusive, asshole parent. Someone also asked if you would rather have been aborted... A moot question because you wouldn't have known had you been aborted  and stuck in the situation you're in now. As far as your other family blowing up your phone, politely but firmly tell them that it is 100% your decision and to respect you and your feelings and the decision you have made. By them continuing to blow up your shit and try to make you do something you don't want to is blatantly disrespectful on their part. Me, I'm blunt and straight to the point and would have literally told them \"fuck off\". You're probably nicer than I am though. \n\nWith all of that said it would probably be worth asking why after all this time she's reaching out to you and also asking her \"what the fuck took you so long\". The reason I say this is there may come a time later in your life when you might want to know her thoughts and reasoning behind what she did and what she wants now. There may come a point in your life where you may regret not knowing the reasons she did what she did. There may come a point in life where it will be too late to find the answers to those question and you may spend the rest of your life kicking yourself in the ass for it. So, no, you don't ower her fuck thing one. BUT, you do owe it to yourself to get answers.\n\nOne other thing to consider: she's a human. You're a human. By design humans are not perfect. Humans make mistakes. An absolute fuckin shit ton of mistakes. She made a mistake getting pregant\u00e9. She made a mistake by not sticking around to deal with the human child she brought into this fuct up world. She made the mistake of not reaching out to you sooner. Mistake after mistake after mistake. So far, in your 18 years, how many mistakes have you made? How many mistakes have your dads made? How many mistakes do you see every day made by the multitude of humans you may encounter? You see? The point is mistakes are made every single day by every single human that has ever existed or will exist. The good humans try to learn from and fix their mistakes and try to not make them again. The others? Well, fuck em. They're the ones that suck because they go outta their way to ignore their mistakes or blame others for them or do the shit on purpose because they think it's gonna benefit them somehow. And unfortunately sometimes it takes a long time and multiple fuck ups to learn from and fix your own mistakes. It seems your mom took her sweet ass time learning from and trying to fix her mistakes. You owe it to yourself to at least give her the opportunity to do so. If anything, give her enough rope to hang herself, so to speak. If anything, you won't live the rest of your life and die knowing that you had an opportunity to at least find out why. I assure you, try to live your life with as few regrets as possible. This could be a regret easily avoided.", "What is with the explosion of cuckoo bird type situations in humanity lately . \n\nRaise your kids people or accept that ur shit.", "NTA. It's up to you whom you allow into your life. Egg donor got what she deserved, just as much care as she gave her own family. Glad you got Nick, he sounds like a great second dad!", "I dont think you are an asshole. You are expressing your feelings by calling her names and such, but i do hope Teresa doesnt fully give up. I hope she leaves you and your family alone (for a long while), but you might one day change your mind. \n\nI totally understand you as i had a crazy parent myself. He tried to reach out multiple times but as i had a restraining order (sucks to suck\ud83d\ude2e\u200d\ud83d\udca8) he always got blocked. He got cancer and asked to get to know me before he died. He did so in a typical shitty parent way as well by saying i would be excluded from the will if i didnt meet him (maybe rightfully so but in my country i had a right to inherit some). I was 14 and it was just too early, never got to know him. I dont regret it but i sometimes wonder what wouldve happened if they were still alive, i would not want to meet them yet (almost 20 now) but im pretty sure when i get further into my 20s i might get curious about who he was. \n\nIf you never ever want to meet Teresa that is fine too, i can understand it as i also never met mine and i dont know if i ever would meet him\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f But i hope that if you do want to get to know them in the future they wont be impossible to find. \n\nAgain, u are not an asshole op, its completely normal to express emotions like this in a situation like this. Everytime my dad would try to show up in my life it would set me back a lot, it obviously took a toll on me and he would shit on all progress i had made with my mental health. So when i say i wish she leaves u alone i truly mean it and im glad you and your family set some boundaries.
