{"id": 21281, "submission_id": "14py9ku", "title": "AITA for the way I handled this situation with my daughter, niece, and SIL?", "selftext": "So, to start, my daughter Lia (14) had recently been having confidence issues. She\u2019d been down about her appearance, and I recently found out that she\u2019s been comparing herself to her cousin (my SIL Joanna\u2019s daughter) Evie (14) when Evie posts pictures of herself on social media. Now, I have nothing against social media, but after looking through Evie\u2019s profile, it\u2019s clear that Evie uses lots of filters and lighting tricks, which again I have nothing against on principle. However, it\u2019s clear that Lia was comparing unfiltered/plain pictures of herself to Evie\u2019s pictures. \n\nI sat my daughter down and started by telling her how beautiful she is, how smart, amazing, and creative she is. Basically your standard mom-pliments. I then showed her how exactly Evie gets her pictures to look the way they do. I showed her the filters and lighting tricks, and she seemed much happier once she realized that Evie doesn\u2019t actually look as perfect as she seems online. We live hours away from their family, so social media is the main way Lia interacts with Evie. \n\nLia then confessed to me that Evie had been commenting very hurtful things on Lia\u2019s posts, calling her ugly, chubby, and calling Lia\u2019s hair dirty and messy. (Lia is mixed and has curly hair while Evie is white and has straight hair). I again comforted her and told her that Evie was just jealous that she has to use filter and lighting to look as good as Lia (this may have been a mistake, but it\u2019s the only thing I could think of to help her feel good about herself.) It worked though, her confidence was way up. \n\nThe next day, I got a call from Joanna. Apparently, Lia had DM\u2019d Evie after our conversation and blew up at Evie. Lia unloaded on her about how shitty Evie made her feel and how nasty and fake she is. Lia also added in my bit about Evie being jealous. Lia had then blocked Evie before she could respond. \n \nJoanna asked me to \u201ctalk to Lia about working through conflict with kindness and calmness and how to use kind words when speaking to everyone.\u201d I asked her if she had talked to Evie about not cyber bullying her own cousin, and Joanna said that that wasn\u2019t the issue at hand. I told her that I was proud of my daughter for standing up to her bully (I later told Lia this as well), and that I would reprimand Lia for her words only if she had said something like what Evie had said to her. Joanna told me I was dismissing her concerns for no reason, and that both the girls were in the wrong so they should both be reprimanded. I told her that Lia did nothing wrong and she should teach Evie not to bully before trying to tell me how to parent, then I hung up.\n\nI went to my husband with the events thus far, and he told me that I had messed up. He said that I should have been peaceful with Joanna when she called and then came to him before making any big waves with his family. Now I\u2019m thinking he may have a point, AITA?", "created_utc": 1688426382, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14py9ku/aita_for_the_way_i_handled_this_situation_with_my/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lia was supposed to react with kind words to someone literally bullying her?", "NTA. Your daughter was being bullied and you helped her put a stop to it. I'm concerned that your husband is more concerned with keeping the peace than making sure his daughter is ok. Your SIL is out of line pretending it's an equal situation. Her daughter was being a racist bully and that is the concern whether she likes it or not. Evie wasn't bullying Lia with kindness and concern. It's the old, don't dish it out if you can't take it. Lia will never forget who stood up for her and who didn't.", "NTA, your daughter was being bullied and she stood up to it. Your SIL needs to address the problem with Evie, who knows how many other kids she's bullying. Kids that age have committed suicide over cyber-bullying and your SIL is not taking it seriously.", "NTA-you are completely right standing up for your daughter and teaching her to stand up for herself.  Your husband, on the other hand, is an AH.  You weren't \"making waves\" in \"His\" family.  You and your daughter ARE his family.  That comment alone tells so much about his values and priorities, and they clearly aren't about you.  He really needs to reevaluate his relationship with his extended family, or you need to reevaluate yours with him.", "NTA Joanna took it to you, you handled it.

Ohnonono.", "NTA", "NTA - the fact that your husband is okay with the treatment of your daughter is a major red flag- furthermore , the fact your SIL is okay with her daughter being a bully says a lot ab her and the family. i guarantee SIL was the classic mean girl i\u2019m school.\n\nif i was you i\u2019d confront the husband ab his acceptance of this treatment and then blast the comments, niece has been making (with ss) all over social media and how you can\u2019t believe family can be so cruel to one another, and that your disgusted with SILs acceptance (and husbands) of this behaviour.", "NTA.  I don't think you did anything wrong, and what I hear your husband saying is that you should have let your SIL get away with her BS, then talked to him about it so he could smooth everything over.  Yes, kids fight, and they can all be jerks, but you don't throw your own kid under the bus so you don't have to deal with crappy family members.", "Nta how about she talk to her daughter about 'if you talk shit, people will stand up for themselves'", "NTA. Age old problem - Evie can dish it but can\u2019t take it so she runs to momma to fight her battles. And then momma Joanna flips the script and has to nerve to say that her daughter\u2019s bullying wasn\u2019t the issue at hand? Really?! That\u2019s some major DARVO at play right there. You didn\u2019t mess up. You set Joanna and Evie straight. They sound like the kind of people who have no problem trampling boundaries.", "NTA Maybe SIL should teach her own daughter about kindness since she's been insulting Lia.", "Info:  Why didn't you reach out to your SIL when you found out your daughter was being bullied?", "ESH, but mainly them.

My 14 year old doesn't need to get into a name calling match to defend herself from a bully I deal with it appropriately.\n\nAlso I know it's a lie a lot of ppl say but try to be more honest with you daughter saying she bullies you because she's jealous is a cop out. Bullies bully ppl for many reasons but it's usually more to do with being able to get away with it than it is jealousy.", "Yeah, you're right; address the racist comments with tact and a smile.
