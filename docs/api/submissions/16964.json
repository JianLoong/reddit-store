So does my son, of course.", "It's 100% about neglect. I actually brought this up to my son. I'm hesitant because he says their dad is abusive and they're afraid of him. But I'm tempted anyway.", "They aren\u2019t his kids so doubtful he\u2019d be given custody of them.", "\u00a8They are not his kids so no, However CPS could be interested in him being a foster parent for them", "It's true and I don't really think it's what our society has come to.

We've already looked into it.\n\nEta: I'm close friends with a social worker with DHR in my county and she says we don't meet the guidelines because we don't have enough bedrooms to offer the kids.

He's done everything he can for them. That's why she calls him when she needs help.", "You should block her completely.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but I suggest for the sake of your sanity to get away from this burning dumpster", "NTA. I\u2019m puzzled about how she is getting a $6000 tax return in the first place. She would need a good income and be having far too much money withheld from each paycheck.", "Could your son move into the vacant house with the kids and foster them?", "As someone noted below, you should call and note that during the call. They\u2019re also being neglected and abused by their mother, which isn\u2019t a better situation.", "Questions: How does your son know the father is abusive and the kids are afraid of him? Has you son ever talked to the kids about their dad? Is there other family that she gets along with/trusts that can be contacted to get a fuller picture of the family & ex situation? It is hard to parse this 1. b/c I usually believe people when they say they were abused. 2. in general, people don't choose to be homeless if their are other options. 3. long term abuse can lead to all sorts of bad choices made by the abused person. 4. abusers lie and can spin an amazingly charming tale of innocence, espically if the abuse people who come off as erratic BUT at the same time, the ex isn't comming off as the most reliable narrator of her own story.\n\nReality: The default is to believe the ex's story and it is entirely possible that your son's ex is the lesser of all the evils presented, unfortunately.\n\nOther Options:\nIt sounds like both you and your son love these kids. Are their ways you could help them that don't include giving her money or things for the kids she can sell? \n\nCan you arrange to send them to camp or have them for a long visit over the summer? The people I've met who behave like the ex want the unconditional love of children and to think of themselves as a great parent, but are also willing to pawn the kids off on anyone, as long as the people taking the kids are willing to play along w/ their illusion that they are a great parent. Yes, that means she is going to use that time to go to mexico and nip or tuck something, but at this point the money isn't going to be spent on the kids weither she goes to Mexico or not.\n\nOr can you pay for extracurriculars or tutoring and give the money directly to the business or school offering the service? Those kids are going to need something outside the home to help them thrive. \n\nNeither you nor your son are responsible for these kids, obviously, but it sounds like you care a lot about them. Kids can overcome this kind of adversity if they have someone in their corner modeling stability and showing them there is something better out there for them. Offering care and  stability, even from a distance, will go a long way toword them having a future that isn't like their mom's present. This may require you to hold your tongue when she talks about what a great mom she is, but you just can't reason w/ crazy.", "ESH\n\nWho gives a shit about the words you say; everyone who is aware of the kids' living situation and hasn't called child services is an AH.", "NTA\n\nAnd may I just say, that if your tax return is that large LOOK INTO CHANGING YOUR WITHHOLDING ON YOUR W4 if you can! Talk to your payroll department and make some changes! Put that money in your own bank account. Stop giving the government an interest free loan.\n\nYour tax return should be small. (There are exceptions of course. Ours was large this year because we unexpectedly had to add extra to our Health Savings Account last year.)", ">t turns out that last year she went to Mexico to get a Brazilian butt lift that she paid $6k for with her tax return. While her children were homeless. This time she needs help because she wants to go back to Mexico to get a tummy tuck with her tax return.\n\nYou know OP, had this **just been** about the surgeries I'd have called you an asshole, because her body her choice etc etc. However, that's not exactly the issue here. The issue here is that a woman with three kids is throwing money after expensive surgeries, in foreign countries, to pretty herself up whilst leaving her kids to starve.\n\nMore than that, you didn't contact her, you didn't blast her on social media, you called her out for being not just a terrible parent, but lacking any self-awareness. She called you whining about how she wasn't getting support from him when the support she wants is so she can fail her kids further. This wasn't an unprompted lambasting, it was her coming to you to get you to talk your son around.\n\nHonestly, call CPS OP. This woman clearly is the definition of unfit.\n\nNTA", "NTA, at all, she is however and giant disgusting one.", "NTA but boy howdy did i ride in here expecting it, from the title \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude05", "NTA", "NTA... I mean... That woman is a crap mother and is using your son. And maybe you need to have a conversation with your son about letting women take advantage of him this way.", "ESH why haven\u2019t any of you called CPS on this woman?!?! You say you care about these kids but your son knew why they were homeless and what she was up to and still supported her!!! Please one of y\u2019all call CPS so those kids can be taken out of this situation instead of asking if you\u2019re an ah on the internet.

Probably you could have said it a little more diplomatic. Still, I don\u2019t think YTA. What a sad situation.", "I think your opinion speaks for all. NTA. You are certainly entitled to it.", "that was my thought. NTA though your title is very misleading.", "Maybe too much money is being withheld but not necessarily. My sister carries 1 dependent and get that amount. She makes okay money but nothing extraordinary. I carry 1 dependent and I had to pay back this year.", "Per the mom*", "NTA... raising your children comes befor elective procedures", "NTA", "Call Child protective services and stop the abuse\u2026 she is not taking of her child. (Unbelievable) she would spend money on her ASS instead of finding a place to live- she needs a mental health evaluation, and the kid needs to be removed from that environment.", "NTA someone needs to say it!", "I believe it's earned income credit but I'm not positive.", "I agree. If it was really about the surgeries I wouldn't have said anything.", "I believe the amount was that large because of earned income credit, but I'm not positive how that works anymore. It's been years since my husband and I have had dependents so we usually owe $$$.", "I've talked to my son about this.", "OP I actually feel bad for the kids, they deserve better. Can't you call child services or something on  her? I'm sorry I'm from a different country so idk laws in yours. Those poor kids have nothing.", "You absolutely need to call CPS. We're talking about a mom who is willing to let three kids live in a homeless encampment without power or water while blowing thousands on cosmetic surgery for herself. That is flat out not a safe environment for children and she had no problem keeping them there, and you have no idea in what other ways she could be denying them basic human necessities. Are they eating? Are they going to school? Is she in the habit of leaving them alone for long stretches to fend for themselves? \n\nYou have no way of knowing what other forms of neglect or abuse they could be facing, but what little you've seen with your own eyes has been unbelievably horrendous. And usually people try to put their best face forward to outsiders. It's almost certain that the 99% of their lives you are not seeing is just as bad, irresponsible, chaotic, and neglectful\u2014if not worse\u2014than what she's shown you.", "OK. That is probably the case.", "Yes, the kids told my son that their dad is abusive. \n\nUnfortunately there's nothing more we can do for the kids. She won't let them have contact with us.", "Ugh. I was so hopping that there was some light in this tunnel.\n\nI wish the best for you and your son and the children.", "Thank you", "Absolutely NTA. It's hypocritical and total crap she's spending money on cosmetic surgery when they were homeless.", "Ordinarily, how somebody spends their money is none of your business.  But those kids are really at risk on a homeless camp.  Please call CPS.  This is child neglect, and somebody needs to get those kids out of there and into a safe place.", "NTA whatsoever.  Truth hurts sometimes.", "INFO\n\nWhy isn't your brother attempting to get custody of his children, who are homeless?", "NTA. Your title should have included neglected her children in the process", "They aren't in the homeless camp anymore. My brother allowed them to live in a house he owns. They stayed there for about 6 months then took off. We don't even know what state they currently reside in.", "I think you misread my post. These aren't my brother's children. My brother's only part in this was allowing my son's ex and her children to move into the vacant house that he owns.", "Fair enough- you were both very kind to help her out", "She made it your business when she called. She may be having these procedures so that she can meet another man, or make money as a dancer or cam girl. Which is fine, but not when your kids are suffering. \n\nNTA.", "NTA she is a piece of trash mother. Instead of providing her a place with free rent you should have called CPS. Those kids would be better off in the foster system. I don't think it's too late to do that.", "NTA - She\u2019s hurting her *kids*\u2026.I\u2019m there with you. I would have said something too.", "Our society has always had people like that.  It's still always a bit surprising, and very sad to hear about."]}
