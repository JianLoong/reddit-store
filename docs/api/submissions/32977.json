Hopefully it might help. \n\nYou've said in another comment that you've been with your wife for 2 years, married for 2. In the grand scheme of things, that's not a long time. You know your relationship, and the feelings bought up in that time period. But longer marriages and relationships have ended for all sorts of reasons. My brother has been in a relationship for 10 years. His girlfriend... isn't great. They split up for a year st one point, and throughout that time, she refused to let her daughter see my brother, or us, until they got back together. This hurt my brother and the rest of us. Now she's 16, and visits us regularly, but that time period changed my Mum's attitude, because after she felt she couldn't be as close to the kid, because she didn't want to be hurt if my brother and her mother split again. \n\nThere's also the comment that your stepson has a relationship with his father and paternal family. Which means that while your stepson very likely loves you very much, you're not his dad. He has a dad. My brother was very hurt when his stepdaughter went to live with her dad recently.

He's a big part of your life, and from other comments you've made, he's in your parents' lives more than your biological child. If your parents are being deliberately viscious, then you need to stick to your guns. If they refuse to see it from your side, again, you need to stand your ground.

Some of those complications arise from the reality that all the kids won't be treated exactly the same because they don't have the same extended families.  \n\nTrees are big.  There's not unlimited space for them on most personal property, so I can see why they want to keep the tradition within the family.

There have been so many changes in my large family it\u2019s funny when we look back at pictures but it\u2019s all love and life. \nSpeak with your mom and say how much you love both your children and wife and her. It\u2019s a tree . Go or not go if you have your own home start the tradition there,have your kids each plant one and spend your Mom pictures", "To quote the movie Clueless. You divorce people, not children.", "NTA. i am a stepdaughter to two step parents. my step dad\u2019s family welcomed me in and treated me as family. my step mom\u2019s did not, and it was always very clear to me, even when i was a kid. my step mom didn\u2019t notice or didn\u2019t care, and neither did my dad (for a very long time). not only was it uncomfortable when i had to be around them, but it also made me feel like my dad had put his new wife and family before me. like he made a choice between the two, and decided i wasn\u2019t as important. it completely damaged my view of our relationship. \n\nit was very emotional for me to read this because it\u2019s clear that you care deeply for your stepson and your wife. of course it is incredibly saddening that your mother doesn\u2019t see them as family, and of course this will be very hurtful to them both. the only thing you can do to protect them from that is not to put up with it.\n\ni think standing up for your stepson was a very noble and loving thing to do.", "NTA. I just hate it when children are used in such a horrible way. It's a child for goodness sake!!", "This. As the adopted redheaded stepchild in my family, I was devastated, realizing I had no one who considered me to be real family.", "NTa screw the 'steps' you're his dad and you acted like it, you saved him from feeling shut out, the issue isn't the tree but the way your mom feels about him.", "> Some of the \"official family\" kids could also disappear from their life for all sorts of reasons & will their trees be\n\nChopped down?", "Our oldest is from my wife\u2019s prior relationship; she is MY daughter just as much as the 3 my wife and I have together.  If my parents EVER treated her any differently than any of our other kids you can bet it would be a major issue.  Thank goodness my Mom and Step-dad see her as just another one of my kids.  However, it has recently come to light through words and actions exactly how me, my wife and my children are viewed by my step-mom; I am my dad\u2019s son, my wife is my dad\u2019s son\u2019s wife and my kids are my dad\u2019s grandkids.  Fortunately, my kids are not old enough to realize it yet, but you can bet your ass we will protect them from being rejected in favor of their cousins (my half-sister\u2019s kids).  \n\nYou are correct the grandparents don\u2019t owe anything, but excluding a child who is part of the family is cruel.  Kids are much more perceptive than adults give them credit for and I\u2019d bet money the child has picked up on how his parents feel about him; hence he does not view them as grandparents.  How hard is it to be kind and inclusive with a child?", "Plus, even if the marriage doesn't last forever, that doesn't necessarily mean the son won't be in their lives. If OP and the son have a strong relationship, he may still want step-dad in his life", "Spite blackberries. Spite ivy. Spite kudzu.", "She didn't say anything about the marriage not lasting, that was a major leap that OP made. There are lots of reasons that relationships change in a blended family situation: custody arrangements change due to child choice, parents moving, illness or death, new lawyers get hired or fired. We have no information about the stability of this custody arrangements or his parents knowledge and understanding of the details of their custody arrangements.", "We'll, OP is divorced. He is Just married for a year. If they divorced OP and his mom would probably never see that child again...", "His previous relationship didn't last and now her granddaughter is not coming to Christmas and the Op wants to replace her with his current partners child...", "When the situation is about a family tradition, and there\u2019s no actual issues between people, the nice thing to do is include the whole family. Even if OP\u2019s parents don\u2019t consider the kid their family, he\u2019s OP\u2019s family and it costs nothing to include him (given OP could easily pay for the tree sapling himself).", "I\u2019ve seen people make that \u201cnot my family\u201d argument here on AITA about adopted kids. \u201cJust because your brother adopted someone doesn\u2019t make them your nephew.\u201d But fact is, in the real world people will consider you an asshole for excluding a child just because you don\u2019t consider them X relation despite them being raised by your family."]}
