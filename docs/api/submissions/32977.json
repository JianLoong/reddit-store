Start by non-defensively asking her what \u201cfamily\u201d means to her (the tone you\u2019re going for here is \u201cinterested\u201d not \u201cinterrogating\u201d). Tell her that you are concerned that she\u2019s suggesting that your marriage is not serious or is questioning your commitment, and see what she says. Ask what she thinks about your wife and her child. Then you\u2019ll have a better idea of how she really feels, now that she\u2019s had a chance to think about it.", "It's a fucking tree!\n\n\nShould they also give the granddaughter xmas presents but give the stepkid none?  (Because hey, he might not still be in the picture in 20 years. He doesn't deserve anything til he proves he's sticking around.)\n\n\nOr how about gathering all the kids around the tree for a photo but then tell the 7 year old child to step out of the way because he's \"not *really* related\"?\n\n\nWhy not insist that they leave the stepson home when they come to visit? (I mean, it's only been three years and they can't risk getting too attached... right?)\n\n\nFuck these people. Fuck them for being cruel toward a small child and fuck them for shitting on OP's marriage as an excuse.\n\n\nThey can take all the time they want to \"bond\".  But that doesn't give them the right to treat ANYONE in this manner - much less family! And OP's wife and stepson are beyond question members of their family at this point in time.\n\n\nNTA OP.  Sorry your mother sucks ass.", "You mean like we won't come to your house if you treat my son differently? \n\nLook up the word hypocrite."]}
