The nasty bastard can walk.", "Guarantee the bf also calls her \u201chis bitch\u201d when she\u2019s not around", "OP said she doesn't like it, he's done it before, apologized, and then did it again \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Nta but why didn't your bf say something the instant his brother said that? It would make me wonder how often he calls you that to just your bf without you knowing.", "Maybe I'm in a hateful mood, but I'd call her bitch nonstop.\n\nHey bitch what's for dinner? Oh why are you yelling, it's just young people vocabulary, I'm trying to be cool and hip like grandson!\n\nHow come you don't like being called a bitch but I should like being called a bitch? I don't understand, my bitch?", "No reason you can't start. It's just the way you talk. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, I'm guessing his grandmother raised him?
