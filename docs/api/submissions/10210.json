Plus, your sister uses those rooms to make money.  Money that she is currently using in part to support you.\n\nYou are a mooch, my dude. You pay nothing but expect to be given everything. You are a man in your mid-30s.  Get a job, start saving, and find a bedroom to rent as your sister does not currently have any available.

You're disrupting her life by moving in with your sister, and now you're demanding that she make even more room for you to settle in? Hell no. She's being incredibly generous already.

Quite frankly, I would not whine about sleeping on a couch when she didn't have to take you in to begin with. \n\nHer house is set up for her life. You are not her responsibility.

You are demanding privacy in the home where you are staying for free.\n\nSounds....spoiled.\n\nYTA. Go stay with mommy.", "YTA, \u201cbut after our mum spoke to her, she agreed\u201d. One, this is called triangulation and can be used as a manipulation tactic, which it was in this scenario. More than likely your mom bullied/sternly spoke with your sister and made her give you a space. \nWhich means you\u2019re probably the \u201cgolden child\u201d and knew your mom would do this and sister would cave. \nYou were the asshole from the beginning. Thinking you can move in and \u201cgenerously\u201d re-arrange her place to suit you makes you even more of an asshole.", "You're the one who's spoiled. You're literally throwing a tantrum because you didn't get your way. You went running to your mommy to tattle on her. Stop harassing your sister and find a job. YTA", "My man. Get a job, you currently own nothing and are a freeloader. You don't get to demand anything when not in your own home. Put on your big boy pants and welcome to the adult world. Again.", "It's her house. You say thank you and take what you are given or you can find somewhere else to stay. What you're NOT gonna do, is dictate how a person chooses to fill their own space in their own house. Get a job and find your own place if where you sleep is such an issue for you. Yta", "YTA. You're 36 and don't have a job, no wonder you're newly single. You should be grateful she offered you a couch to sleep on. You don't like it, then be a responsible adult, get a job and pay for your own place. If that's too difficult and you don't like the arrangement she was gracious enough to offer you, then you can go find somewhere else that's willing to deal with you.", "YTA. Stop asking people to bend over backwards to accommodate your issues. Instead of being thankful your sister took you in, you are acting entitled, accusing her for being selfish and spoiled over HER home. I don't think she is the one who is selfish and spoiled, buddy.", "Yta\n\nDude!\n You're 30+something, no job, no money, not even gf.. Basically you have nothing and you have a gut, so bold, cheeky of you to insult, name call and demanding your 32 years old sister that work hard and having her life on track (own house and business) to give you something that you have no contribution/involvement except in the name of 'family /brother /sibling'? \n\nYou should be ashamed.. I can imagine you become a laughing stock of your ex gf new bf. \n\n>I told her she\u2019s an asshole and a selfish prick.\n\nNo, this is you.. But you forget to add 'entitled pri#k'\n\n\nMove out, get a job.. Be a man - not a leech (mooch)", "Your question was Am I The Asshole ?\n\nThe answer is Yes.", "YTA- You don't have a job or any money and your sister is helping you. You're very entitled and ungrateful.", "YTA. Hope your sister kick you out of HER house soon. If your mommy (that you dont want to live with, but jump to write that she is on your side) agrees with you, maybe mommy can give her bedroom to you.", "LOL she's spoiled when you're throwing an actual temper tantrum about not being given your own room in someone else's house during your temproray stay???? What a joke \ud83d\ude02\n\nYTA and you'll be lucky you don't get kicked out of her house either.\n\nYou're an adult, get a job and your own place. Don't be an inconsiderate selfish mooch off other people.", "YTA- you think it\u2019s excessive?? Sorry did someone ask you, the dead beat brother that your mum has forced her to give shelter to, your opinion? Jeez get a job and move out like wtf \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s her home, her call. You aren\u2019t contributing financially so you definitely aren\u2019t entitled to a room. It seems like she only let you in because you made mommy dearest have a go at her so why not move in with your Mother instead?", "This cannot be real life", "YTA- this can\u2019t be real.. no way OP does not see that he is indeed the AH. \n\nIt\u2019s your sisters house! You don\u2019t have a say in anything, just be grateful you have a roof over your head which you won\u2019t for much longer with this BS", "YTA", "YTA, seems like you want to get very comfortable for a temporary guest she didn't want in the first place. \n\nAlso get a job and stop mooching off others, I can see why you're single.", "YTA It's her house. You are staying for free. You don't get equal says.", "YTA and a hobosexual too.", "NAH. Unless you push it. You might have some pull if you were paying rent.", "Also he had to call mommy to get her to force the sister to take him in. Guaranteed this cycle of no job, getting kicked out of his home and leeching off family and friends has been happening since his late teens lol. OR he only just recently moved out from mommy's house and found our the real world is HARD", "Love how he has the audacity to call her spoiled as well. Dude needs to get a grip.", "Seriously, that stuff is what's paying her bills, aka the rent free house he being allowed to stay at.  So what does he do, \"I'm telling mom!\".  So juvenile.", "Excellent comment & assessment. When there's a common denominator...", "Yup. He needs to find a job, or maybe two or three jobs so he's only at his sister's house to sleep. After a 12-hour-workday that couch will look so good to him he won't care about any privacy.", "But, but, he *can't* get a flat because he's too good to work which is what his ex just didn't understand! /s\n\nYTA OP, clearing out a room would only be if she considered you a roommate, surprise, she doesn't, she views you as a very unwelcome (which from the tone of your post sounds very deserved) short term guest. It's her house, not yours, and only people who pay rent get rooms.", "Just came to say this. YTA, OP!! Get a job and get your spoiled selfish ass out of your sister\u2019s house! She doesn\u2019t want you getting comfortable she wants you out. And from your post it is abundantly clear to everyone exactly why that is.", "Absolutely YTA! \n\nNot only is it not your sister\u2019s responsibility to let you stay with her but you also had your mother convince her to allow it in the first place. As a GUEST in her home that she didn\u2019t offer for you to stay at, it is an implied responsibility for you to have as little impact on her life as possible.", "And you shouldn\u2019t be let stay on the couch if you\u2019re going to try make yourself a permanent unwelcome guest.\n\nGuess what? Her rubbing her business which pays for that apartment - it\u2019s not excessive for her to need space to work. It\u2019s excessively self centred and entitled of you to think your sibling should support you. Get your ass out of your sisters space. \n\nYTa", ">Not just her home, but her place of business--if she's getting a tax write off for those rooms, she can't just let them be used by him as a \"bedroom\"", "I think Mom is trying any tactic possible to make sure OP doesn\u2019t end up on HER doorstep next.", "I like how he refuses to stay with his mom but think her agreeing with him strengthens his argument. YTA. She is doing you a huge favor.", "He was leeching off his ex - in her place which she paid for, no wonder she kicked his entitled ass out. Sister should do the same.", "Right. Not to mention that this is her place of business? OP, those two offices are her office. Just your presence in the apartment will be a distraction to her even on the couch. You're Choosing Begger, aren't you?", "I can't believe his ex dumped him. Clearly, this 37 year old man is such a catch. Stunning personality and unemployed!  I can't believe she let him go! /s", "That\u2019s a very going point! I forgot about the home office tax write off.", ">Not to mention that this is her place of business?\n\nAnd that is almost certainly why she can both afford and justify having a 3br flat. Her computers and the products she's selling earn their keep in the flat, OP doesn't.", "Ahhh I gotcha now.  Your English is pretty good, don't worry about it.  I didn't catch you were being sarcastic but I'd think that happens sometimes in any language if you're writing back and forth to each other."]}
