Plus, your sister uses those rooms to make money.  Money that she is currently using in part to support you.\n\nYou are a mooch, my dude. You pay nothing but expect to be given everything. You are a man in your mid-30s.  Get a job, start saving, and find a bedroom to rent as your sister does not currently have any available.

Quite frankly, I would not whine about sleeping on a couch when she didn't have to take you in to begin with. \n\nHer house is set up for her life. You are not her responsibility.

It\u2019s her house and it sounds like you\u2019re staying there for free, so you can accept her decision or you can leave. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re roommates who both have an equal claim to the place; she\u2019s doing you a very large favor and you\u2019re whining about how it\u2019s not good enough for you. If I were her, I wouldn\u2019t give you a room because I\u2019d be afraid you\u2019d stay forever if I did.", "YTA go live with one of the friends who somehow think you aren\u2019t the AH lol", "Um, you aren\u2019t staying long so be thankful for the couch.

I hope she finds someone, x7 better than you.\n\nYTA.", "Get a flippin job you user.", "YTA\n\nI think I can guess how you became single.", "YTA entitled much?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSounds like your sister knows if she gives an inch you will take a mile. Good for her!\n\nEdited to add comment", "YTA. No job/no rent/no money yet you think you\u2019re entitled to better accommodations. You sound like a jerk & your sister probably doesn\u2019t want you to get comfortable mooching off of her.", "Your sister isn't spoiled...you are..she is the one with the job and apartment...you are the one unemployed who is homeless\n\nShe isn't selfish you are...you're 36 not 6 act your damn age stop mooching off your sister and go stay with your mom if you have such a problem with your sister\n\nYTA", "You are the asshole. It's her house. She doesn't want you there.\nYou don't get to demand anything \nGet a job and move out.", "I would have kicked you out already and blocked you. YTA", "YTA. I can guess why the relationship ended. \nYour sister did not want you to move in and gave you the couch because she does not want you getting too comfortable with this *temporary* arrangement.\nYour sister absolutely could consider consolidating her offices. My guess is that she would if the person moving in didn't act entitled to the space without contributing to it in any way. You are an adult. Providing for you is your responsibility, not that of your ex-gf, sister, or parents.\n\nEdit: you are not the AH for asking a second time and hoping she change her mind like you said. You were the AH way before that", "I get a glimpse why you got dumped.\n\nYTA.", "YTA You are an unwanted guest.", "YTA", "YTA I\u2019d put money on her deliberately giving you a mediocre place to sleep to prevent you from squatting there permanently", "YTA and she is smart.  She doesn't want you comfortable in her house.  She will never get you out if you are.  No job, lived off your GF..no wonder she doesn't want to give you a bedroom.  You are lucky you got the couch it could be the streets.  Get a job, any job at least it is some money.  Stop living off of women.  Don't like the living conditions? Leave\n\nInfo: did the GF kick you out because you don't work?", "YTA if you want privacy get a job & move out. You are freeloading off your sister. I applaud her for making you uncomfortable so you have the desire to get out of her home sooner. She doesn\u2019t owe you a guest room.  If your mother is so supportive of you having your own room go live with her & she can provide you one. Again the only selfish entitled AH is you.", "YTA, your a temporary guest in her house. You don\u2019t mention paying rent so what entitles you to a room? \n\nNothing spoiled about using rooms in a place she pays on her own. She\u2019s want you out, not to getting too comfortable and extending your stay. \n\nYour mom is probably only on your side bc she doesn\u2019t want you at her house.", "YtA her house, her your rules. You are a feee loader here", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re mom had to convince her to let you stay. \n\nThe more comfortable you are, the less temporary this becomes. \n\nTake the couch and work on getting out.\n\nHer business helps pay for the place you living in\u2026.so if she wants 2 rooms for it, she gets 2 rooms. It\u2019s her home.", "YtA. You're a 36-year-old adult man without a job.  You are in no position to demand or ask for anything. Go get a job, help with the bills, save, and move out", "YTA- \n\nAre you kidding me right now? \n\nYou pay no rent? You have no job? You eat, sleep and live for free at a siblings place... And your complaint is that your sibling (who is entirely supporting you) won't sacrafice her business to support you MORE... YTA. Big time. \n\nAnd you think that you get to be a choosing beggar who turns up your nose at your mom's place and is too good to sleep on a couch but at age 36 can't be bothered to contribute financially in any situation (not with a partner, not to a sibling, not to a parent). Nope. Not how that works. \n\nAnd you think harassing her every day to treat you like a roommate (which you ARE NOT) is going to get you anything other than kicked out? \n\nYou want privacy? It costs money. Money you don't have.\n\nYou're going to get kicked out of your sister's place. And frankly, she should have kicked you out already.", "YTA. Get a job.", ">I told her she\u2019s an asshole and a selfish prick\n\nWell, let's see, she didn't want you there to begin with, but somehow Mom got her to agree. \n\nYou don't have a job, and this is supposed to be \"temporary.\" If I were your sister, I would NOT be rearranging my house to make things more comfy for someone who 1) I didn't want there in the first place and 2) someone who hopefully won't be there for long. Maybe bunking on the couch will be a good motivation to get a job and move out sooner. \n\n>My mum is on my side\n\nHmm? The same mum who had to convince sister to let you move in to begin with? It sounds like she coddles you and treats you like the golden child at the expense of your sibling(s). I bet she is on your side. Her baby boy probably can't do anything wrong in her eyes. \n\nBut yeah, anyway, YTA and I wouldn't call someone an asshole or prick when they are putting a roof over my head and a couch for my ass to sleep on. That's a strange way to say \"Thank you for taking me in\"", "YTA - she's doing you a favor. Grow up. Be gracious, tell her thank you for giving you a place to stay, find a job quickly, & move out ASAP.", "Yta, and not a very bright one at that. She doesn't want you there and if you keep it up she will kick you out very soon. She had to be talked into even letting you live there. Read the room.", "The issue is, You. \n\nYou are not paying rent and this is not permanent. She is not being selfish. It's her home. I suggest you tone it down if you don't want to be booted out to mama next. \n\nNot only should you be keeping the living area tidy, you should be helping w chores and appreciating someone is allowing you to live on their couch for free. \n\nYTA.", "Exactly. Your sister really said here have a couch so you don\u2019t get too comfortable and want to get the hell out quickly. Ya know, because you\u2019re a grown ass unemployed man depending on your younger sister. YTA. Grow up.", "This", "And this.", "I feel awful for the sister getting strong armed into dealing with OP. He\u2019s calling the way she runs her business \u201cexcessive\u201d as if he knows what it takes to build something and be self sufficient.", "I think the mom is on his side because if the sister gives him a room, mom won\u2019t have to. I bet mom doesn\u2019t want to support him either.", "Enough cheek for an extra arse this one lol. YTA", "And get a job so you can get your own place.  Then you'll have all the privacy you desire", "Lol. Exactly. \n\nStarting to read the op, I was thinking that it was fine to ask his sister, one time, if he could rearrange the furniture to have a room, but it quickly became clear she can't let him get too comfortable. She needs him out ASAP. \n\nThis entitled couch surfer has decided that she doesn't need an office and a storeroom?  Lol. Let's have the employed fiscally responsible people make those decisions. \n\nYTA OP", "You should go rent a really nice place and not let her have a bedroom in it.", " She\u2019s definitely not going to rearrange her home to make you more comfortable or you will never leave.", "How is she spoiled?", "Comes into her home and expects hospitality when she has an entire business to run while he freeloads because Mom doesn't want him anymore than his little sister does! 36 years old and sleeping on little sister's couch wanting to step on her business functionality so he can have privacy. To what? Jerk off and nap?", "It's probably one of those two options. Either way, it's  not because he's right!", "I'm sorry, english isn't my first language so it may be not clear enough, I mean it doesn't add up to call her spoiled when he's clearly a momma's boy, he's the one being protected and relying on the sister for everything, so clearly she isn't spoiled. I meant it like sarcasm(?), showing he's clearly being biased on this affirmation."]}
