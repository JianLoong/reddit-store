Don't tell anybody. Go to a lawyer, and set up a trust (or whatever it is in your country) so that she can get a portion you deem worthy when she comes of age - or an age you feel would be appropriate. For some countries that's 18, some it's 25, it varies.  Protect yourself, don't let the vultures come pecking at you for money.  Make them talk to the lawyer for anything involving money, so it takes you out of the equation.  It will be much easier for you to say, \"Ask the lawyer\" if someone shows up at your doorstep begging for cash.  Then, it's the Lawyer that says no, not you.  Does that make sense? \n\nAnd you would not be an a h if you decide not to give her money right now, you don't have to do anything ever, really.

He doesn't really get to decide for you anymore.

Would you still feel obligated to do so?\n\nHis wishes aren't really relevant at this point. What happens with that money is up to you. And you can decide what to do with it regardless of what you *suspect* his wishes may have been (assuming he never actually wrote down he didn't want your half-sister to see a dime, given your wording). For all you know, he could have been regretting his actions towards the end of his life and never got a chance to update his will.\n\nLike I said, you're not an AH regardless of what you choose to do. But I wouldn't use the \"my dad wouldn't have wanted it\" thing as an excuse.

You dont need to give her half, but a nice amount would be wonderful, and would be fair.\n\nYour Dad is gone, and so he has nothing to do with any decisions you make.
