Don't tell anybody. Go to a lawyer, and set up a trust (or whatever it is in your country) so that she can get a portion you deem worthy when she comes of age - or an age you feel would be appropriate. For some countries that's 18, some it's 25, it varies.  Protect yourself, don't let the vultures come pecking at you for money.  Make them talk to the lawyer for anything involving money, so it takes you out of the equation.  It will be much easier for you to say, \"Ask the lawyer\" if someone shows up at your doorstep begging for cash.  Then, it's the Lawyer that says no, not you.  Does that make sense? \n\nAnd you would not be an a h if you decide not to give her money right now, you don't have to do anything ever, really.

Would you still feel obligated to do so?\n\nHis wishes aren't really relevant at this point. What happens with that money is up to you. And you can decide what to do with it regardless of what you *suspect* his wishes may have been (assuming he never actually wrote down he didn't want your half-sister to see a dime, given your wording). For all you know, he could have been regretting his actions towards the end of his life and never got a chance to update his will.\n\nLike I said, you're not an AH regardless of what you choose to do. But I wouldn't use the \"my dad wouldn't have wanted it\" thing as an excuse.

You dont need to give her half, but a nice amount would be wonderful, and would be fair.\n\nYour Dad is gone, and so he has nothing to do with any decisions you make.

Unless it is stated in the will that you will lose the inheritance if you give her money, it is yours to do with as you wish.", "Was your dad actively preventing or arguing against you having a relationship with your sister? That\u2019s pretty shitty, despite all of the obvious pain and anger he feels. He should never have been making you feel like he disapproved of you have a relationship with her when she is an innocent party in all of this.", "The thing that is said often on the personal finance subreddit is that you don't do anything for an entire year after a death. Your emotions are all over the place while grieving and it's a good idea to really think about what you want to do. Secure the money and wait one year - it'll fly by - and don't tell anyone you have money because people LOVE to spend other people's money. Above all else, do not let any relatives talk you into investing in their business or buying them a new car. Hide the money and wait one year. \n\nOh, and don't let any relatives move into any of the houses; you will never get them out and they will never pay you a dime. People get really greedy and conniving when there's a young person coming into a lot of money. Get cameras for all properties.", "But why would she go no contact with mom if the family found out at age 14 that a  different guy was the father of her sister?\n\nI mean I get that the dad wouldn't want anything to do with mom but I'm surprised a 14 year old kid would cutoff contact with her mom over an affair + deception.", "[removed]", "Not according to him and his will.", "But it would still be a betrayal to give it to someone he didn't wanted it to have. He already paid 14 years for a kid that's not his, it would be a betrayal to have more of his money go to it.", "I don't understand how a man could reject the child he raised for 11 years.  Reject the mother, but how do you just turn off a father's love like that?", "Because some people are understandably upset at their parent when they find out the parent cheated, lied, and deceived the whole family.", "Obviously there were more things at play. I went low contact with my mom as soon as it was possible too, and she didn't cheat on my dad. I also have no relationship whatsoever with my half sister. Long story. But i suppose that just like in my case, it's more complicated than it seems. \n\n Maybe op was a daddy's girl and this hurted her a lot. Cheating affects the kids too, not just the spouse.", "So a child realized one parent betrayed the other and effectively destroyed their happy family. Your question is why a child would go NC with the person who hurt their parent and destroyed their family?", "He was her father for 11 years then both he and her sibling suddenly abandoned her.  You don\u2019t think that was devastating? Whatever her mom may have done, she is completely innocent. But she is the person that has been paying the price for this since she was a child.", "Maybe, but that doesn\u2019t mean OP shouldn\u2019t do it if they want to. I would rather \u201cbetray\u201d a dead parent than continue to make life harder for an innocent party when it\u2019s already more money than I need for a lifetime. \n\nI\u2019m not saying OP has to give their sibling anything, just that whether or not anyone but OP considers this a \u201cbetrayal\u201d shouldn\u2019t in my opinion be a factor.", "1) what kind of monster refers to a child as \u201cit?\u201d\n\n2) her dad was being vindictive to the wrong person.  It MIGHT be an ah move to give money to the mom because the mom betrayed the father, but OP wants to give money to her half sister, who hasn\u2019t done anything wrong.  That the father left her nothing is irrelevant, he\u2019s dead and got his wish of washing his hands clean of his ex and her other child.  Now it\u2019s his daughters to do with as she pleases, and if she wants to help her half sister that\u2019s appropriate, so long as it\u2019s what she wants.", "[removed]", ">continue to make life harder for an innocent party\n\nBy that logic, she should give the money to everyone out there. Also, her not giving the money to her half sister isn't \"continuing to make her life harder\"... it's not op the one who made her life harder in the first place. \n\n> I would rather \u201cbetray\u201d a dead parent than\n\nI think that would depend on the family relations. The dead parent is predumably someone op loved very much, while half sister is someone she is low contact with.", "All you care about is assigning blame. No one is disagreeing with you on that. The problem is that the person who is paying the price is not the mother. It was an innocent child, who lost both her dad and her sibling for no fault of her own.", "Your missing the point\n\n\nYes the blame is on the mum, but the daughter has left at her father twice", "No actually, logic does not follow that since OP could provide financial support to someone they have a direct relationship with they should also do so for \u201ceveryone out there\u201d. Nice straw man though. \n\nHalf sister is someone OP is low contact with because, according to them, their father disapproved of a relationship which is frankly a shitty thing for a parent to do even in these circumstances. So again, whether OP considers this a \u201cbetrayal\u201d should be up to them, and whether that betrayal is justified should also be up to them.", "[removed]", "It was to her \n\n\nNot her biological father, but for 11 he was her father, the only father she has ever known \n\n\nThat 11 years doesn't suddenly disappear because he found out he was not her biological father", "Exactly.  I would venture to guess that his name is still on her birth certificate.  He also would have been paying child support unless he demanded a DNA test.  In some cases/places he would STILL be responsible financially since he WAS HER FATHER for 11 years.", "[removed]"]}
