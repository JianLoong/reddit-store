A coworker, Sarah (32F), recently went into labor unexpectedly during a busy workday.\n\nNow, I don't know Sarah that well outside of work, and we're not exactly friends. We're cordial and chat during lunch breaks, but that's about it. She approached me with our other coworker, Gwen, clearly panicked, and asked if I could lend her my car to get to the hospital since her partner was out of town and her car was in the shop. I think she and Gwen carpooled with another coworker who didn't stay in the office today, I'm not too sure.Here's where things get tricky. I rely heavily on my car for my daily commute, and public transportation isn't an option. I also have to food shop, collect my husband from work and my two year old from preschool to drop at Tony's. On top of that, I had a really important meeting scheduled later that day, one that required me to have access to my car for transportation. I knew that if I lent my car to Sarah, I'd not only be stranded at work with no way to get home (an hour drive) but also risk missing my meeting. The hospital is about an hour's drive in the opposite direction.Feeling torn between wanting to help and needing to ensure my own transportation, I hesitated and finally told her that I couldn't lend her my car. I tried to explain my predicament, but she looked devastated and hurt. Another coworker ended up offering their car, and Sarah made it to the hospital just in time.However, the tension in the office is palpable. A lot of my colleagues think I'm heartless for not helping her out, especially considering the circumstances.So AITA??\n\n(Temporary account)", "created_utc": 1692656518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xm6zz/aita_for_refusing_to_lend_my_car_to_a_coworker_in/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she\u2019s on the verge of going into labor at any moment, why is her SO out of town?\n2. You say you live in a rather remote area where taxis as not viable and what sounds like lack a decent hospital (you mentioned going to the hospital and back to pick up your child would have taken 2 hours).\n3. They should have ask the \u201coffice\u201d not you personally for a RIDE to the hospital. Who just gives someone they don\u2019t know their car keys?\n4. It may come as a shock but yes, your life and what you needed to do was MORE IMPORTANT than your coworker in labor. You have a husband and child that requires you to pick them up. Not give a stranger your car and hope for the best\n5. There is no way to know WHEN you\u2019d even get your car back. Did the coworker plan to drop her off and turnaround? No, she would have gone and stayed with her. What about getting to work tomorrow?\n6. Where is this coworkers OWN family.\n7. She could have called an ambulance. While more expensive and not preferable, her poor planning necessitated it.", "[deleted]", "NTA\n\nSomeone (supervisor?) should have called an ambulance. \n\nLabor affects everyone differently. She might have delivered the baby en route (necessitating an ambulance anyway), she might have had a seizure (putting her life and the lives of others at risk), she might have passed out from pain (see above), there are a number of factors that make \u201cdriving yourself to the hospital while in active labor\u201d a really, really not good idea.", "This is extremely poor planning on the pregnant woman's part.\n\nIf the woman is 36 wks or beyond, it is considered full term and she should have had emergency transportation arranged.\n\nYou had valid reason why you could not lend your car.  I would have considered driving the woman to the hospital and backs except you had an important meeting.  I don't know if driving a pregnant co worker to the hospital would have been a valid excuse.\n\nNTA for not lending your car.", "NTA.  I would have driven her, but to give my car to a person experiencing periodic labor pain? Hell no!", "NTA.  I would never lend my car to a pregnant woman in labor trying to get to the hospital (or the her friend with her).  That sounds like a recipe for disaster, an accident just looking for an excuse, and a huge insurance mess.  Her problems are not your problems.  She could have called a taxi or other ride service.  \n\nBut I do think I would have offered to drive them if the boss said it was okay to leave early.", "Absolutely NTA - You had real obligations and your own family to consider. She had options. Besides it is really unsafe to drive while in labour! She could have caused a car accident during a contraction.

What about the other coworkers? Why did they not step up if they were so critical?  I know there is a need but Sarah knew she was about to pop, should have planned for it.", "Edit: Based on the info below, I'll say NAH. You're not obligated to lend anyone your car and it sounds like you had a lot going on, including daycare pickup for your own child. I will say, though, that the focus on this meeting seems odd, given the fact that you would have been helping a coworker in a potentially serious medical situation. One would think that most workplaces would extend a bit of understanding in the circumstances. \n\n\nInfo: Was Sarah planning on driving herself to the hospital in active labor? Is there a reason she couldn't call a cab or an ambulance, or have someone else drive her?", "Nta. Please tell me I didn't read that right,  Sarah drove herself!?? If so that's incredibly dangerous. Your work should have called an ambulance if no one was available to drive her.", "NTA. You had commitments that you needed the car for. Not that it matters, you don\u2019t owe your coworker car rental rights anyway.", "NAH\n\nThey were likely in crisis mode looking for a quick immediate solution. \n\nSolution was unworkable for you, so they did something else. \n\nIt sucks when you can't help someone in need, but it happens.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
