Literally everything in the kitchen was purchased by my boyfriend or myself. This includes all of the basic kitchen supplies such as silverware, dishes, all appliances, and cookware. We also bought all of the food and spices as well as all cleaning supplies. The only thing the other roommate has bought has been the stuff for his specific meals as he is on a restricted diet and his meal prep containers. \n\nIt has become a big issue where he will use all of the seasonings that I purchase and not replace them. He has also used all of the foil, parchment paper, etc. There was a few times where we had very large sizes of stuff that my boyfriend and I purchased because we mainly buy in bulk from Sam\u2019s Club. He frequently uses out stuff to the point where it\u2019s empty and then doesn\u2019t replace it. We have asked him to replace the stuff he uses and he either doesn\u2019t or will buy a cheaper smaller version of the item. He said he doesn\u2019t see the issue with it since it\u2019s in the kitchen. My boyfriend has specifically asked him to help contribute to the stuff of ours that he uses but he told him that \u201cit was too expensive for him to buy\u201d. If it\u2019s too expensive for you to use then you shouldn\u2019t be using it and expecting someone else to pay. Not to mention he questioned me the other day as to why something I bought for a meal I cooked wasn\u2019t in the fridge anymore because he wanted to use it and was planning to use it for his food. Like dude wtf I bought that for myself not for you. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are super close to having to buy all new pans and silverware, because the roommate continues to use the pans to cook meat on but leaves then to sit with grease on them or instead of washing it just puts a new piece of parchment paper over the dirty pans and reuses it to the point everything is rusted. These pans were brand new when we moved in and we don\u2019t use them aside from the occasional cooked we make which don\u2019t cause a pan to rust. He said that \u201cit\u2019s not from him and he doesn\u2019t use it\u201d while literally taking his food off of the pan. He told me that \u201cit was like that when he moved ins bc they are cheap anyways so it didn\u2019t matter.\n\nWe also have almost half of our silverware missing, because he takes our silverware with him to eat his lunch or meals at work r other places but forgets it. We confronted him about it after his girlfriend brought some of the silverware back from his apartment to which he said wasn\u2019t from him. \n\nWould I be the asshole if I took everything out of the kitchen and boxed it up so that he can\u2019t use anything?

Since he\u2019s \u201cnot using\u201d your stuff, why would he care if it all disappears?", "NTA\n\nI think you need to get a new roommate before you get new pans.", "NTA. I've been in your situation before, and he's just straight-up exhibiting bad roommate etiquette. If you use something up, then you should be the one to replace it. Can't afford to replace it? Don't use it. I once had a roommate who used up a bottle of avocado oil that I bought, and thought that a can of Pam spray was a proper replacement. Needless to say, we don't live together anymore lol.", "YWNBTA, but you have to understand that this is not going to get better. He has shown you that he doesn\u2019t care about you, your home, or the peace that should exist between you. You should believe him. \n\nI\u2019d look into new living arrangements.", "I so unbelievably wish that it was possible to just \u201cput someone out\u201d but unfortunately laws are in place to protect that now. Everyone please consider who you\u2019re living with before living with them and then don\u2019t do what I did. Always look at the red flags before", "NTA. This is beyond ridiculous if he somehow thinks this is okay. Does he just think all that stuff got purchased and put there for him by magic? Definitely remove it all from his reach since he absolutely can\u2019t be trusted with any of it. And I assume you\u2019re considering different living arrangements?", "NTA. It's time to ask him to leave. If that's not possible, box things up and wait it out until your lease is up (I assume you're renting at your age, but I could be wrong). At that point you can move, or he can.", "NTA but wouldn't it be easier for you and your bf to move out to your own place? The guy is gross too, re-using pans with parchment just yuck. In the short term take away everything that's yours.", "NTA, especially for pans if he's damaging them, if you end up buying new ones it's perfectly reasonable to say he absolutely can't use them. Practically, if ditching him isn't an option and you want to remain cordial until you can, an easier way of confronting the spices problem firmly but without seeming petty would be to use an app like splitwise, so you can present a neutral rule \"everything we share gets split\", and an app notifies him when he needs to pay you back. It works well for distancing yourself from roommates while being firm on contributions.", "just kick him out he is taking advantage of you   \n\n\nNTA  \n\n\nexcept maybe to yourselves for continuing to put up with his BS", "NTA. To make it seem less aggressive, I would probably leave the most damaged and cheapest items (e.g., salt) out for him to continue using. Remove the other items. Stories like this are why I am happy to be at a point in life that the only 'roommates' that I have are family.", "NTA. And as long as you have boxes, box his stuff up and set it outside the door with a note telling him he doesn't live there anymore.", "NTA at all. Sounds like you need a new roommate", "Nope. Box it all up and find a new roommate who is not an A.", "NTA. He needs to go.", "NTA for looking out for your interests. He's taking stuff & doesn't take care of stuff he uses.\n\nYou have a bad roommate. I call BS on blaming the rusty pans on cooking meat, though. Not washing them & drying after causes rust. Doesn't matter if it's bacon or turnips being cooked.", "YWNBTA\n\nTake all of your things and lock them up in your room until you can get rid of that nightmare of a roommate.", "NTA, sometimes the only way to deal with people like this is to move the stuff to where they can't get it. Make sure when you box it up that you put a lock on the box because otherwise they're just going to pull it out of the box and keep using it anyway while still denying either that they are taking it, or that it was in the box in the first place.", "NTA. If he can\u2019t contribute to the community supplies then he shouldn\u2019t use the community supplies unless it\u2019s agreed upon by everyone that he isn\u2019t obligated to help. His lack of care for your pans, silverware, etc is just disrespectful and he\u2019s proven he can\u2019t be trusted with those, either.", "NTA! That sounds infuriating. Please update us with his reaction after you do it.", "NTA but you should also consider a new living arrangement", "NTA, but this will only make your life more difficult, which is unfortunate.  I think a young couple plus a friend are just a bad roommate combo. Obviously, there are always exceptions, but I've seen this before. You and BF are in the nesting/domestic phase of young adulthood and he's caught somewhere between being the \"kid\" in your house and a one-man fraternity.", "NTA, but: Why do you have this person living with you?", "NTA\n\nYou should get a new roommate.", "NTA.  I don't know the best way to cut the roommate off, but he has to stop gaining access to your stuff.  If it's as he says and you guys are out fault, then you'll find that out in short order. If it's as you've laid out then you'll be able to protect your stuff.  The only thing I'd worry about is that he'll throw a tantrum and I'd hate to be alone with the dude when he realizes what you've done.", "NTA", "No \nJust get some bins.\nAlso when he buys parchment or foil use it all.\nOf course it will be from a dollar store", "NTA. You've tried to talk to roommate repeatedly, so it's time to take action. Install some locks on cabinets or remove your items from the kitchen. He's not respecting your belongings or replenishing common use items, so he can just get his own stuff to wreck.", "YWNBTA, he hasn't learned not to use them, so it's time to take the option of using them away.", "NTA. He sounds entitled and I hope you guys can get rid of him soon. I would 100% do the same thing if I were in your situation. You\u2019ve tried talking to him and it\u2019s clearly not working and he thinks he can do whatever he wants. He may snap back when he sees everything is gone but that still seems better than the alternative of him using/ruining your things.", "NTA- He\u2019s not helping and that\u2019s on him. He\u2019s using you and taking advantage of how nice and accommodating you have been.", "YTA if you don\u2019t move your stuff.
