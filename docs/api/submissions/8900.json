Practically, if ditching him isn't an option and you want to remain cordial until you can, an easier way of confronting the spices problem firmly but without seeming petty would be to use an app like splitwise, so you can present a neutral rule \"everything we share gets split\", and an app notifies him when he needs to pay you back.

The current state of affairs is ridiculous as you describe it. Tell him not to touch any of your things, even if they were previously \"common use items\". Every thing. Ride him constantly about it. Make him unwelcome, as he has worn his out, and offer to release him from his obligation to the current lease. Make him want to do that more than he wants to stay put.", "Some people honestly don't know and have to ask. Don't hate on them for potentially not knowing any better. Everyone learns... at SOME POINT. Now they've learned. Fuck off.", "Get a lock for your closet too, or better yet, get a lock for your bedroom. I wouldn't put it past him to go into your room to take stuff when you're away. Make sure everything is locked up when you're actively not using it.", "lol. if she doesnt know then how did she manage to list so many grievances?", "It's called being a doormat. Some people learn from a young age to make themselves small and to people please because it keeps them feeling safe. I was 22 the first time I even questioned if I was allowed to say no to situations I wasn't comfortable with. It's a process. Clearly OP is learning boundaries right now. And breaking a lease is no joke. And evicting someone is even harder due to all of the laws around housing. \n\nI will leave you with this: Why does it make you feel so good to hate on others and rile them up?", "I'm imagining a locking tool chest on wheels"]}
