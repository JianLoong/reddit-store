Yes, she is legally entitled to name her baby whatever she wants, but that does not protect her from the social consequences of said choice. Her callous behavior makes me question her empathy and respect for you. Has she behaved in similar ways before?\n\nIn general, it annoys me how baby names are considered a free for all on this platform. In my family, an aunt named her newborn Nina. Her 15 year old niece was also named Nina. Suddenly, \"Big\" Nina only ever heard her name used in relation to the baby, and often perked up thinking people were speaking to/about her only to realize they were referring to the baby. Already painfully shy, she became even more withdrawn, and told her mom she felt erased. That \"Little\" Nina was a do-over. Perhaps her reaction would have been different had they informed her before the baptism.\n\nOf course it would be painful to hear this name over and over again in relation to someone who is not your daughter. I hope your sister understands. I am sorry for your loss.", "NTA? i get it, no one owns names. but having given the info you provided it comes off as inconsiderate and insensitive imo. no i don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to try and tell someone what name they can/can\u2019t use but i don\u2019t agree with her wanting to use that name knowing it upsets you and given the terribly unfortunate situation. it might not have the same significance to her as it does to you but there are legitimately millions of other names. to me it\u2019s basic respect and she is overstepping. i would never do that to anyone close to me and i feel like that should be common sense? of course unless discussed and encouraged by you. but at the end of the day you can\u2019t tell someone what to do. i\u2019m sorry for your loss and i\u2019m sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA. To people saying \"you don't own the name\", if you're above 15, get over yourselves.\n\nWay for your sister to poison you and your wife's relationship with her and the niece by naming her after your dead baby you still mourn. It's not so much about the name itself, but creating a living reminder of what you went through that will be in your face, so to speak, at random times. \nHow she can be so inconsiderate of her brother (you) is beyond me.", "NTA. As your sister, she should know - or at least contemplate - how this might make you feel.\n\nAbsolute best case scenario would be if she asked in the hope of bringing commemoration to your angel by naming her daughter the same.

Of course no one \"owns\" a name but the lack of empathy from the sister is appalling. 20,000 baby names are out there.

I don't know if I could come back from that if she follows through.", "NTA- I would respond to the text message to state that while she can pick the name she wants for her child, it will always remind you of and be the same of your child. Here or in Heaven, your precious daughter is still your daughter. if she cares so little about your relationship and she chooses to name her child that name, that you will be going no contact with her. She can choose to name her child whatever she wants and you can choose who is around you and your family. If your parents and other extended family support her decision to use the same name, then let them know you will be going low contact or no contact with them as well.

This was your baby and you don't need to get over it, your own sister should be on your side.\n\nI'm sorry for your lose and the grief you still feel, you should not be expected to put it aside and if your sister goes ahead with this name then I wouldn't blame you for pulling back from her but guaranteed she will play victim.\n\nAnyone here not understanding your view needs to give their heads a wobble, I've seen comments saying it was her neice but sorry being the aunt in this situation does not give anyone the right to trample the fucking parents of the dead child's feelings.", "INFO: Was the name you chose for your daughter a significant name in the family, honoring a grandmother or someone like that?", "NTA. Yes, fine\u2026.Technically nobody owns a name and yes, technically you can\u2019t ban her from using it but there is nuance in the world ffs. Your sister sounds horrendously cruel.", "NTA and I question the integrity of anyone who votes any other way. This isn't about owning a name or banning a name because it was the name of your favorite book character in 3rd grade.\n\nThere are thousands upon thousands of names. This is OP'S *dead* child's name. Sis is willing to cause her sibling pain and grief for a lifetime because the name is pretty to her. What kind of person is willing to cause ongoing emotional pain to a loved one for life because they can't be bothered to pick one of thousands of pretty names instead? The kind of person who is an asshole.", "NTA. Does you sister want her baby to be told she was named after her dead cousin when she\u2019s older?

This is your sister we are talking about here, she knows about the background and the meaning this name has to you. Dead or not, this is your daughter's name and your sister knows how important it is to you. And how painful it could be to name her own daughter the same name. Usually, I would say that you can't reserve a name and keep people from using it. But this name has been given to someone already. If your daughter had been born healthy, your sister very likely wouldn't have chosen that name. So, in this case, I really think your sister should choose one of the other two names.", "Normally nobody gets to own a name but this is an unusual case and your sister is definitely TA.", "NTA. Your sister is being selfish, inconsiderate and unfeeling to keep that name in the mix after you expressed your feelings in the matter. I'd stop kicking up a fuss and tell her and your mother plainly that it's not okay and they are risking their future relationship with you and your family if she insists on using the name", "NAH but slightly leaning towards your sister possibly being one.. I know it\u2019s sensitive but a 16 week fetus may not hold the same weight for everyone in your family, the way it did to you. Yes, she was very much your daughter and child but.. unfortunately that doesnt mean her name which you had decided to give to her at birth is off limits to others.. your sister isnt wrong to like it still and wish it for her child and you arent wrong in your EMOTIONAL aspect but logically, your sister isnt wrong either.", "Would your sister still be considering using the name if your daughter had been born healthy and was around today? If not, then perhaps she doesn't realize that it wasn't just a pregnancy, it was a real-life human being that you loved and lost. I don't know your sister, but assuming she isn't a bad person, I'm thinking that maybe because she never met your daughter (and you lost her at 16 weeks), she is looking at it as though you've just reserved this name out of sentimentality, rather than it being the name of a little girl that existed for a moment in time. It's ignorant, but often times people who haven't experienced this kind of loss don't register that it's not just a pregnancy that didn't take - it's a real loss of a real child. Your sister might not comprehend that, and therefore not understand why this is such an insensitive move on her part.", "Holy crap, NTA. The one name, ONE. Why would she put you and your wife through this? Is she normally cruel?", "NTA\n\nIt's like family members don't even care about other. \n\nWho does that to their sibling?", "NTA but your sister sure is!!!  Enough said.", "NTA\n\nYour niece will remind the entire family of the baby that is no longer here.\n\nImagine knowing that, and doing it to your child anyway.\n\nImagine being that child, because she'll 100% feel something is wrong.", "NTA\nIf your baby girl was here now,  would she use that name?  Because if she wouldn't then it's off limits. I had a baby last year who we never brought home. I would never speak to family or friends again if they used my little girls name.  Super aware that her name can still be used by others, but those who know what we have been through shouldn't want to subject us to her name and watching another child with her name grow up. Just let your sister  know you won't be seeing the child or her if she chooses to gi through with this. It seems she probably doesn't feel she's getting the same amount of attention you did surrounding your baby and she's trying to claw it back in some way.", "NTA. I considered using my niece's name for my daughter's middle name a few years after she passed. I didn't even like the name, but I loved my niece. I asked my sister, and she said it would hurt her if I did. It was immediately crossed off the list. How could your sister be so cruel?", "NTA. My brother and his wife lost their baby when the child was just a few hours old. A year later my aunt named her son the same name...a  name that had no ties to our family other than the deceased boy. It was cruel and unnecessary. \n\nAsk your sister why it is so important to her to cause you pain? Because it makes no sense she is willing to sacrifice her relationship with you over a name.", "Wondering why your sister didn\u2019t ask you what you thought about it. As that would be a kindness to be expected. But she is free to do what, she wants. Nothing one can do to change that. And you are free to feel as you do. Have to assume your sister has issues with you enough to not give a darn about having a good relationship with you. Not hunting or implying you did anything to maybe cause it.

But your sis can call her own baby as she pleases.", "i'm a bit conflicted here. You're NTA for how you feel but I think you are an AH for the way you've handled it. *Telling her off* and *demanding she remove the name from the list* is not a mature way of communicating how you feel about this and i'm sure has just added fuel to the fire. I'm guessing the sister would have more regards for your feelings if you hadn't acted so entitled over the name.", "Info? Was the name a family name or was it one you guys liked with no significance?", "As much as a feel awful for you, and you\u2019ve every right to question it, in a way you are being unreasonable.\n\nYou simply cannot decide what other people call their children, not in a rude way to you, but you can\u2019t just blacklist a potential name because of something that you planned that went tragically wrong, especially when you do have two children of your own. \n\nIf someone likes a name enough, no one else has a right to tell them they HAVE to name their child something else just because they also like it, or wanted to use it at another point.", "ESH yes it all hurts and you need to heal but you don\u2019t own the rights to any name regardless of the circumstances. Your sister should have a bit of compassion for your feelings but she is allowed to pick any name she wants.  She is probably trying to honor your daughter in some way.

On one hand it\u2019s none of your business what name your sister is gonna choose. On the other hand it\u2019s hurtful if she\u2019s gonna use your girl\u2019s name.

Since then, she has had twin boys.  My other sister and I have had 4 girls between us since her loss, and we would never use her daughters name.  I actually love the name they picked, but I love my sister more.  You shouldn't have to tell her, she should know.   I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA.  If it was a family name or had other special meaning, then I would think differently, but as you have made clear in comments that no such circumstances apply, your sister is an AH.  She can name her baby whatever she wants...but she shouldn't.", "NTA...but your sister is totally TA...", "NTA.\nBut I think blowing up at her was useless and, depending on her personality, maybe even counterproductive. Instead of yelling at her, maybe say, \"Well, if you name her me daughters name, it is going to be so painful for me to hear that I won't be around you or her much. I hope you can understand that.\"\n\nAnd leave it there.", "Poor baby that has to grow up carrying the burden of grief!\nYour sister is an idiot!\n\nMy kids middle and last names began with S\nEliminated my first choice since it began with A\nWho wants to be tormented for having A$$ as their initials for their entire life?\n\nChoose names carefully with the well-being of child and future adult in mind.", "JFC what is wrong with people nowadays. You're NTA. Your sister is an absolute AH (and other words that would get me muted) and has no right to call her daughter the same name as yours. \n\nIf she doesn't drop the name I'd go LC. People are so rude and cruel.", "NTA. Yes you can't \"oun a name\" but that name has already been given to you child here or not that's her name. If she was named after a grandmother then sis would have a bond with her it would still be shitty but there would be a reason. She has no good reason to choose that name.\n\nIt reminds me of a story we're the new gf of oop's baby daddy wanted to name there new baby the same full name as oop's baby.\n\nAsk her why she's trying to erase your childs memory.", "NTA if the name has no family or cultural significance. \n\nYou sister should show you some respect if she knew your baby had that name.", "Shame on you!!", "NTA. It's incredibly insensitive for your sister to do this. If she ends up with this name, know you will likely have to go NC with her to protect yourself. \n\n\"Naming your child after our dead one would be incredibly disrespectful to the memory of our baby and further bring up trauma every time the name is mentioned. Your child is not a \"do over\" baby. They deserve their own name, free of this trauma. If you cannot understand this, then we should no longer talk to each other.\"", "No, it's just a name. Quite unusual and she would have never thought of it had we not chosen it for our baby.\nThank you.", "Oof. Just imagining a 15 year old girl getting \"Big\" prefixed to her name and the obligatory volume of body image issues that come with that age category has my heart ache for her.", ">In general, it annoys me how baby names are considered a free for all on this platform.\n\nIt's not surprising at all all, though, AITA is chock full of \"technically correct, which is the best kind of correct\" personalities. If something is legal a lot of people on the sub refuse to even consider that legal =/= morally correct or kind.\n\nNo one is saying that one person gets to claim all the family names because they called dibs at 13, but it's incredibly callous to name our daughter a name you only heard because a sibling was going to use it for a daughter who didn't make it to birth.\n\nThere's also a very cold attitude on here towards parents who've suffered pre-term losses vs. family members who've had live births. I can only think it's because the sub skews very young, so miscarriage and stillbirth are abstract concepts to many readers and they have a hard time conceptualizing *wanting* a pregnancy.  So they don't have empathy to the very real pain couples feel when it comes to the loss of wanted pregnancies that they've been trying for years to have, or the way you love it as a child the moment you find out. \n\nKindness and consideration aren't legal obligations but they are what sets non-AHs apart from AH. People forget that.", "Yeah that\u2019s weird. I can\u2019t imagine my sister having a kid and then just deciding to give my kid the same name like that\u2019s normal. I know people will chime in with the \u201cthere\u2019s 5 Mikes in my family!\u201d but I think it\u2019s different when it\u2019s like, your second cousin Vs. your sibling\u2019s kids.", ">In general, it annoys me how baby names are considered a free for all on this platform\n\nI usually see it in the context of \"AITA for telling my SIL she can't use the name she chose because I've reserved it for my future hypothetical child\".", "No, it's not a special name. One of my boys has my grandmother's name as his second name and her daughter is also going to carry that name as her second name.", "What's so interesting is that a while ago there was a similar entry by someone else with a clear 'Not TA' voting. IIRC it was a woman whose daughter had died. OP's sister became pregnant and decided to give her own daughter the same name as OP's deceased daughter, even though OP had asked her beforehand not to. The entry was about a more specific event, where their parents had an altar/memory-corner to the deceased daughter and the sister asked the parents to take it down because it would be hard to explain to her daughter why there was an altar to someone with the same name.\n\nEven though it was about a more specific event, i.e. the altar thing, the general consensus seemed to be that OP's sister was an asshole for even giving her daughter the same name in the first place. Yet, here, a surprising number of people are questioning OP on the significance of the name ('Is it a family name or just a random name you liked?') and seem to be siding with the sister.\n\nI wonder why that is? Is it because the OP here is (presumably) male? Is it because his daughter was deceased even before being born and therefore not a 'real' person? Is it because of the manner in which OP seems to have communicated with his sister? Or is it something else? I'm baffled.", "I agree. People love to learn a phrase and use it as a general rule without using critical thinking on specific situations. NTA.", "Exactly! Just because a thing is completely fine legally, doesn\u2019t it make it morally right and it baffles me that that is a foreign concept for a lot of people here!", "You said this close to the way I was thinking, so I would just like to piggy back off of it and add that it\u2019s also only a top three name for her.. so it seems almost deliberately hurtful for her to not even budge on the matter.", "It\u2019s an actual child, I wouldn\u2019t expect downvotes for that.", "No, it's not a special name. One of my boys has my grandmother's name as his second name and her daughter is also going to carry that name as her second name. Everyone is fine with that.", "Also keep in mind that OP had already told his sister he didn't want her using that name before she sent a shortlist and asked for his opinion. That seems deliberate. If she really cared for his opinion, she would have kept his objections in mind and not put it on the shortlist in the first place.", "Even if the sister doesn't feel the same way as OP she's disregarding how OP feels after being told repeatedly how hurtful the proposed name would be", "This is pretty much my exact verdict. I realize people are emotional about things like this, but I have a hard time condemning the sister because a 16 week fetus is different than a baby to many. It\u2019s not particularly nice of the sister, but I don\u2019t think it makes her a full on asshole to like the name. Maybe I would feel differently if we knew the name and could judge how unique it actually is.", ">your sister isnt wrong either\n\nI think she's wrong, wrong, wrong for being willing to hurt OP over a name *that is on her top 3*. It's not even the only name she likes.", "Monsters i guess.", "If his sister was a human being with a beating heart he wouldnt have to tell her.\n\nYou dont have to ask or demand. Its should be understood by default. What he did is justified since he is dealing with a monster that pretends to be his sister.", "I\u2019ve seen this question asked above in the thread and op said no. It was just a fairly unusual name that op and spouse liked and chose.", "OP has three children, not two. One of them is deceased. So bizarre and callous that the sister even wants to use this name.", "So if your kid died you\u2019d be fine with your sibling naming their kid the same name as yours? \n\nNo. You wouldn\u2019t. You can say you would all you want but until you\u2019ve lost a kid\u2026you can\u2019t know. You wouldn\u2019t be okay with it.", "Honor, the daughter by upsetting the parents?  I very much doubt that", "Honouring OP's daughter would be using her first name as a middle one, not choosing the exact same name.", "If it's done to honour her niece, that would become a necronym.\n\nI had necronyms. Most people in my culture has necronyms.\n\nIn fact, one of my sisters wasn't allowed to name her next child after the deceased infant son due to her severe grief. It's not because it isn't allowed, but deemed so after the circumstances because one aunt years later was allowed to do the same.\n\nMy sister however could use the name with a hyphen between it an another name.\n\nI can't give a verdict because necronyms are expected in my culture while in others, it's a complete taboo.", "I think some of the issue is how the OP describes approaching it.    It doesn't sound like a discussion was had instead it sounds like the OP dictated to the sister, even telling them off.", "Really? So, if your child, who had a fairly unusual name, died, it wouldn\u2019t bother you to hear it over and over at every family gathering? \n\nThis seems very cold-hearted.

Grim!", "NTA. When my Mum was pregnant with me, she was going to give me the name of her sister that died in infancy. Her mom told her absolutely not, that it was very bad luck to do that. I am not named after my dead aunt.", "NTA. I wonder if the narrative below will work:\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the origin of your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh it was originally the name of my deceased cousin.\u201d", "In this case, NTA.", "Yes, it definitely put a strain between the aunt in question and her sister because of the way it affected the teenage Nina. Nina also distanced herself from her aunt since she had not factored into their naming choice whatsoever (emphasized by the aunt's husband when people asked if the baby was named after the niece).", "Well it\u2019s not like the exact same people are commenting on every story. \n\nThe majority of votes here seem to be NTA as well.

The third in question was aborted during pregnancy.", "When a family member dies no one renames other family members because of the one who passed away. Here we talk about a 16 week fetus who was not even born,  not a kid. I am very sorry for OP's loss, evidently that was and still is a very traumatic experience for them, but it does not seem fair for other family members that they have to devote themselves to the same level of grief. I would recommend the OP and his wife to go to therapy.", "So convince your future niece when she's older to change her name. Or is that too batshit to go around controlling other people's names?", "Yes absolutely I would. \n\nIf my sister for example loved that name in particular, and my child wasn\u2019t born and I had two other children afterwards, absolutely.", "It\u2019s not a dead kid.
