Yes, she is legally entitled to name her baby whatever she wants, but that does not protect her from the social consequences of said choice. Her callous behavior makes me question her empathy and respect for you. Has she behaved in similar ways before?\n\nIn general, it annoys me how baby names are considered a free for all on this platform. In my family, an aunt named her newborn Nina. Her 15 year old niece was also named Nina. Suddenly, \"Big\" Nina only ever heard her name used in relation to the baby, and often perked up thinking people were speaking to/about her only to realize they were referring to the baby. Already painfully shy, she became even more withdrawn, and told her mom she felt erased. That \"Little\" Nina was a do-over. Perhaps her reaction would have been different had they informed her before the baptism.\n\nOf course it would be painful to hear this name over and over again in relation to someone who is not your daughter. I hope your sister understands.

To people saying \"you don't own the name\", if you're above 15, get over yourselves.\n\nWay for your sister to poison you and your wife's relationship with her and the niece by naming her after your dead baby you still mourn. It's not so much about the name itself, but creating a living reminder of what you went through that will be in your face, so to speak, at random times. \nHow she can be so inconsiderate of her brother (you) is beyond me.", "NTA. As your sister, she should know - or at least contemplate - how this might make you feel.\n\nAbsolute best case scenario would be if she asked in the hope of bringing commemoration to your angel by naming her daughter the same.

She can choose to name her child whatever she wants and you can choose who is around you and your family.

This was your baby and you don't need to get over it, your own sister should be on your side.\n\nI'm sorry for your lose and the grief you still feel, you should not be expected to put it aside and if your sister goes ahead with this name then I wouldn't blame you for pulling back from her but guaranteed she will play victim.\n\nAnyone here not understanding your view needs to give their heads a wobble, I've seen comments saying it was her neice but sorry being the aunt in this situation does not give anyone the right to trample the fucking parents of the dead child's feelings.", "INFO: Was the name you chose for your daughter a significant name in the family, honoring a grandmother or someone like that?", "NTA.

Your sister sounds horrendously cruel.", "NTA and I question the integrity of anyone who votes any other way. This isn't about owning a name or banning a name because it was the name of your favorite book character in 3rd grade.\n\nThere are thousands upon thousands of names. This is OP'S *dead* child's name. Sis is willing to cause her sibling pain and grief for a lifetime because the name is pretty to her. What kind of person is willing to cause ongoing emotional pain to a loved one for life because they can't be bothered to pick one of thousands of pretty names instead?

This is your sister we are talking about here, she knows about the background and the meaning this name has to you. Dead or not, this is your daughter's name and your sister knows how important it is to you. And how painful it could be to name her own daughter the same name. Usually, I would say that you can't reserve a name and keep people from using it. But this name has been given to someone already. If your daughter had been born healthy, your sister very likely wouldn't have chosen that name. So, in this case, I really think your sister should choose one of the other two names.", "Normally nobody gets to own a name but this is an unusual case and your sister is definitely TA.", "NTA. Your sister is being selfish, inconsiderate and unfeeling to keep that name in the mix after you expressed your feelings in the matter. I'd stop kicking up a fuss and tell her and your mother plainly that it's not okay and they are risking their future relationship with you and your family if she insists on using the name", "NAH but slightly leaning towards your sister possibly being one.. I know it\u2019s sensitive but a 16 week fetus may not hold the same weight for everyone in your family, the way it did to you. Yes, she was very much your daughter and child but.. unfortunately that doesnt mean her name which you had decided to give to her at birth is off limits to others.. your sister isnt wrong to like it still and wish it for her child and you arent wrong in your EMOTIONAL aspect but logically, your sister isnt wrong either.\n\n\nThat being said, I personally wouldn\u2019t ever do this to my sister on an emotional level.", "Would your sister still be considering using the name if your daughter had been born healthy and was around today? If not, then perhaps she doesn't realize that it wasn't just a pregnancy, it was a real-life human being that you loved and lost. I don't know your sister, but assuming she isn't a bad person, I'm thinking that maybe because she never met your daughter (and you lost her at 16 weeks), she is looking at it as though you've just reserved this name out of sentimentality, rather than it being the name of a little girl that existed for a moment in time. It's ignorant, but often times people who haven't experienced this kind of loss don't register that it's not just a pregnancy that didn't take - it's a real loss of a real child. Your sister might not comprehend that, and therefore not understand why this is such an insensitive move on her part.", "Holy crap, NTA. The one name, ONE. Why would she put you and your wife through this? Is she normally cruel?", "NTA\n\nIt's like family members don't even care about each other. \n\nWho does that to their sibling?", "NTA but your sister sure is!!!  Enough said.", "NTA\n\nYour niece will remind the entire family of the baby that is no longer here.\n\nImagine knowing that, and doing it to your child anyway.\n\nImagine being that child, because she'll 100% feel something is wrong.", "NTA\nIf your baby girl was here now,  would she use that name?  Because if she wouldn't then it's off limits. I had a baby last year who we never brought home. I would never speak to family or friends again if they used my little girls name.  Super aware that her name can still be used by others, but those who know what we have been through shouldn't want to subject us to her name and watching another child with her name grow up. Just let your sister  know you won't be seeing the child or her if she chooses to gi through with this. It seems she probably doesn't feel she's getting the same amount of attention you did surrounding your baby and she's trying to claw it back in some way.", "NTA. I considered using my niece's name for my daughter's middle name a few years after she passed. I didn't even like the name, but I loved my niece. I asked my sister, and she said it would hurt her if I did. It was immediately crossed off the list. How could your sister be so cruel?", "NTA. My brother and his wife lost their baby when the child was just a few hours old. A year later my aunt named her son the same name...a  name that had no ties to our family other than the deceased boy.

Because it makes no sense she is willing to sacrifice her relationship with you over a name.", "Wondering why your sister didn\u2019t ask you what you thought about it. As that would be a kindness to be expected. But she is free to do what, she wants. Nothing one can do to change that. And you are free to feel as you do.

IIRC it was a woman whose daughter had died. OP's sister became pregnant and decided to give her own daughter the same name as OP's deceased daughter, even though OP had asked her beforehand not to. The entry was about a more specific event, where their parents had an altar/memory-corner to the deceased daughter and the sister asked the parents to take it down because it would be hard to explain to her daughter why there was an altar to someone with the same name.\n\nEven though it was about a more specific event, i.e. the altar thing, the general consensus seemed to be that OP's sister was an asshole for even giving her daughter the same name in the first place.

The people treating this as an early miscarriage are really missing the point here.  1) early miscarriages are still emotionally painful for many people, especially when it is taken them years to get pregnant, 2) this was not early 3) this was not a miscarriage and 4) when you tell your sibling this is causing me emotional agony and they decide to proceed, they are choosing to disregard your feelings and potentially lose their relationship with you. OP's sibling is choosing that.\n\n16 weeks is much farther in the pregnancy emotionally than people who do not have children or work in prenatal services realize. Risk of miscarriage is much higher in the first trimester.  By 16 weeks you know the sex of your child, you have completed the genetic screening, you can feel them moving inside of you and your abdomen feels hard from their presence.  You can tell they're there all.  You are planning for the arrival of your child, and have told friends and family that you are expecting, possibly even started planning with your employer.\n\nIn the recent past, OP's daughter's brain incompatibility with life would not have been spotted prior to delivery and his daughter would have been carried until the death of the fetus and subsequent miscarriage, OR after 20 weeks, the stillbirth of the child.  Currently, anatomy scans are typically done between 17 and 21 weeks (that's two weeks before viability), so they very well could have been terminating at 21 weeks. \n\nThanks to science, this baby was spared the pain of birth and immediate death.  OP's wife was saved the physical and emotional stress of a later term and more arduous miscarriage probably requiring medical intervention, or carrying and giving birth to a baby that would either be stillborn or would not live.  \n\nTo spell it out for those without knowledge in this area, pregnancy is physically taxing. Delivery is physically taxing. Carrying a baby and giving birth takes an extended period to recover from physically and to re-regulate emotionally.  It's a lot to go through even when you get to have a baby in your arms at the end and I can't imagine doing it with empty arms.  Carrying a non-viable pregnancy through to the end substantially delays when you can become pregnant again, not just the additional weeks that you are pregnant, but the recovery -- the recovery period  from the pregnancy will be longer.   Additionally, with any birth comes the risk of C-section, tearing, hemorrhage, and hysterectomy  Carrying the baby till miscarriage or to term also would have meant up to 26 weeks of people talking to them about their pregnancy which would have been excruciating.   \n\nOP and his wife made a logical choice to minimize the physical toll on his wife's body and to save themselves all those weeks if people approaching them to talk about the pregnancy.\n\nIf they had carried the baby to 20, 23, 30 weeks, would anyone be questioning if OP's sister was an asshole?  \n\nAnd to some degree, it doesn't matter what week it was. When you lose a wanted pregnancy you lose a vision of a future.  You visualize having a family for years or even decades.  Finally pregnant, you visualize so much more vividly.  You visualize how old your child will be at their first Christmas, when they will go swimming for the first time. What week of pregnancy you are in can onlly tells how many weeks of this more vivid visualization you've been having.  When you lose the child, you lose that vision, but you also feel the threat that you might not get to have *any* baby.  Sure not everyone has to agree with you or support you, but surely your sibling shouldn't be a dick about it.\n\nLast, OP's sister did not approach him and say \"hey, I love you and I think often about the daughter you lost.

She doesn\u2019t visit, but it comforts her to know where he is.)\n\nMy sister is unaware that my aunt had a second stillbirth at all, actually. The first one was at full term and everyone knew she had been expecting because she\u2019d been obviously pregnant at family gatherings. The second she carried smaller, there were no big family gatherings, and she went into early labour, so a lot of us didn\u2019t know.
