That level of disrespect & carelessness is unforgiveable at the present time. Dan & I sat down & talked after everything quieter down & he sees why i am so hurt & upset. In turn, he said he will stand by me on my terms of when she is allowed back in the house. MIL went back pulling thw full victim card with the rest of the family. So now the rest of the family are all pissed at me saying im a bitch & asshole for breaking MIL's heart & keeping her son from spending precious holidays together.

How absolutely RUDE to show up uninvited, to LET HERSELF in, and to demand to utilize your kitchen. She definitely was doing this as some sort of power play, considering you had made your wishes abundantly clear.", "INFO: you say that you\u2019ve lost your oldest boy (for which: hugs, I cannot imagine your grief) but that implies more than one child. \n\nNowhere else in your post do you mention your other child (except possibly \u201cMy boy\u2019s crochet\u201d, but that could refer to oldest son + husband). \n\nWhere was your other son (or: other children) when all this was happening?", "Please change your door code for your safety. So sorry!", "I am going to say NAH.  Yes, your MIL barged in, but I think her heart was in the right place.  She's grieving too, since she lost a grandson and wanted to help.  She may have been ham-handed about it but you're all in a bad place.\n\nI'm so sorry about the loss of your boy.  The firsts after death are the hardest.  You were doing what you were doing for your mental health. Going forward be very firm and tell her that you need to be alone for the time being and you will touch base with her later.\n\nHugs to all.", "More Info: This year we did not even decorate inside. No tree no stockings absolutely no decorations. I couldn't handle opening the ornaments and such. The memories of all the Christmas traditions were just too much too bare. This is the first holiday season without my son so I found treating Christmas as an ordinary day just made it go by easier this year.  Well that was the goal at least.", "NTA", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI am glad Dan now understands even a little how horrible this is for you, because it is now his responsibility to protect you from his mother and the rest of his family.\n\nI hope your pain eases soon.", "Her heart may have been in the right place but she completely overstepped and stomped on your fragile peace - she gets what she gets.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to be polite to unwanted guests. She walked in, demanded dinner and drove 3.5 hours to do so. She is a boundary stomping asshole.", "I am so sincerely sorry for your loss.  NTA - you explained your situation and she decided she knew better and did it anyway.  You told her she was incorrect.  That is called holding a boundary and you did it well, everyone else can take a hike and cool off.\n\nWishing you peace and comfort going forward. (Also, change your door code)", "NTA it does not matter what the intent of the MIL was, she has no right to barge in to your home like that.", "First of all let me say I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm going to say NAH\n\nYou are all grieving and emotions are running high. MIL probably didn't mean any disrespect and likely just wanted to make sure you were both OK and spend some time with you both and try to take your minds off things. \n\nAnd you are obviously devastated so your reaction is completely understandable.  Sometimes being around people is just too much during the difficult times.  The holidays are always the most difficult time after a loss and everyone has their own way of managing their grief.\n\nI hope that you and MIL are able to open up to each other and communicate those feelings in a way you can both understand and that eventually you can lean on each other in these difficult times.", "NAH\n\nSorry for your loss\n\nYour mother in law was trying to help but she should not have tried to make the decision for you.  Anyone with an ounce of sense will know that people have to grieve in their own way and not try to force them into something.  Their son will have spent many Christmases with them so him missing one to be with you at this time is perfectly reasonable.\n\nHowever you should have been decisive and made your choice not to attend much earlier as you knew weeks ago that deep down you didn't want to go as it was too soon for you.  You kept them in limbo and that's not fair on them.", "NTA so, you were clear with her that you were not up for celebrating, and she decided to *invite herself to dinner at your home*. With *zero* notice, and showed up when she figured food would be ready? Absolutely the fuck not.\n\nEven if you had cooked and food was ready when she showed up, what could possibly make her think that you would have made enough for random guests?\n\nYou are *grieving*, and she needs to learn to respect boundaries.", "NTA.  The audacity! Showing up to someone\u2019s house uninvited expecting dinner is AH enough.  Showing up to someone\u2019s house who is clearly grieving and doesn\u2019t want to \u201cdo\u201d the holiday this year is a flaming AH move no matter what her intentions or feelings are.  If she wanted to see her precious baby that should have been brought up separately and done somewhere else.", "Grieving or not, anytime you show up unannounced (with driving 3.5 hours!) and walk in the door without knocking,, you are the asshole. It does not matter what your intentions are. MIL is definitely the AH here.", "I only had 2 kids both from my ex husband. My boys are grown adults late teens beginning twenties. My younger sob is in another state spending Christmas with his sister who is much younger than him from his biological dad. It was a present for my son i gave him because he really really wanted to spend time with his little sister since the passing of his brother. Their dad split from her mom and they live in a different state so most of their sibling relationship has been video chats. It was his wishes to spend with his sister and I supported it. It was therapeutic to him.", "We did that evening.", "It's not her grandson. Step-grandson eventually, it depends on when OP married her husband. She told in another comment that both her sons where from another relationship.\n\nThe MIL was rude. One does not come unannounced and just come in without knocking. If she wanted to see her son she could just have asked him if he was OK with going to the restaurant near their house for 1-2 hrs.", "The pain of losing a child isn't easy to handle. I'm sure your son doesn't want you to be in pain. I'm sorry for your loss. It's going to be really hard when his birthday comes around.", "We lost my dad 6 months ago. I put up indoor/outdoor decorations to keep up some sort of normality but my sibling didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t want to decorate. Everyone handles grief differently and the way your MIL disregarded your legitimate feelings is super gross. \n\nSend a mass text to everyone of your previous messages to your MIL and block everyone until the new year. NTA.", "Funny you say that about the lock codes. Once the dust settled it was the first thing to happen.", "So she invites herself to dinner with no notice and shows up when she figures food will be ready, just assuming that they made enough for random guests?\n\nNo.\n\nIf MIL meant no disrespect, she would have *at the VERY least* called ahead and *brought* food.", "If she was trying to help, she would have at tge very least called ahead and brought food.\n\nInstead, she shows up unannounced and uninvited, right when she thinks food will be ready, assuming they just happened to make enough for random guests.", ">Your mother in law was trying to help\n\nHow exactly was she trying to help?  She showed up uninvited expecting to be fed.", "And she drove 3.5 hours to do that. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That MIL is the ultra AH", "Not just showing up. But timing it so she thinks food will be ready and she can just sit down and eat. Not offer to help. Not bring food. Just expect that food made for two will feed four and the person staying home because they are struggling should do the labour. \n\nNope. Just no. NTA", "She may have been unthinking, rude, concerned whatever I get that based on OPs wishes. I certainly don\u2019t think MIL was the asshole though either.", "Anytime you show up unannounced (with driving 3.5 hours!) and walk in the door without knocking, you are the asshole. It does not matter what your intentions are. MIL is definitely the AH here.", "NTA. In case she hadn't noticed, YOU'RE the one who is trying to deal with NEVER being able to spend precious holidays with YOUR son EVER AGAIN. You made it very clear that you weren't going to be emotionally ready to deal with other people on Christmas day, and she decided to bulldoze her way right past your boundaries. Your husband could have gone to her house, but he chose to stay with you - as he should. Change the door code and have your husband let his mother know that for the foreseeable future, any meetings between them will be held somewhere other than your home. Your mental health takes priority over her feelings.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine the grief you must be feeling.\n\nWhat your MIL did was unthinkable. Please get your door code changed as soon as you feel able to. Being able to feel safe in your home is paramount.\n\nThe rest of the family calling you names... not OK. Go as LC as you need for as long as you need.\n\nDan is supporting you in your decision. I'm glad your MH Team also are being supportive.\n\nI so hope things will ease a little for you when this toughest of seasons passes.", "Nta", "NAH. Dan should have left you and go to his mother for Christmas. You can have several partners but only one biological mother. The lady is in her 70s for Christ sake.", "Is Dan your late son's father? If he was a step relative  MIL might not be very considerate because he wasn't  \"her grandson\" it's unfortunate that some people are like that. Tell people who are bothering you to EXPLAIN THOROUGHLY how barging into someone's home while they are grieving their child and demanding to be hosted is ok  ask them how THEY would react to someone barging into THEIR HOME while THEY are grieving THEIR CHILD and demanding to be hosted. Because I am willing to bet she neglected to mention that part of the story. And that is exactly what she did barge in while you were grieving and demanded to be hosted. Came to dinner and spend time with you. Eh no. She SAID she came at the time cooking would usually be done. It sounds like this was the first Christmas after your son died. She expects you to be fine. NTA", "I'm so sorry for all you are going through. I can't even imagine. I too wouldn't want to be around people. The fact that she just walked over your boundaries is so wrong.  You could have been 10 times as harsh and still not have been out of line.  \n\nTake care, I know it will be a long slow road but I hope you can find peace again.", "My MIL is well into her 70s and would never dream of doing this. Your MIL is overstepping majorly and got what she deserved here.", "Leave a grieving partner alone on her first Christmas without her son? Just because the OPs son died young doesn't mean Dan's mother might not live another 20 years!", "There is literally no way on earth that MIL didn\u2019t intend to disrespect OPs VERY VERY CLEARLY STATED NEEDS. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to excuse the actions of someone who purposefully made the choice to go against what a grieving mother has very clearly told her she needs.\n\nIf someone tells you what they need and you decide to go against that so clearly, then it\u2019s obvious your concern is not for that person, it\u2019s for yourself.", "Don't be ridiculous. She drove 3.5 hours to arrive at OP'S home at the time \"the cooking would be done\" she punched in the door code and walked right in she ANNOUNCED they were there for dinner and to spend time together. She walked right in and DEMANDED to  be HOSTED. You think that kind of disrespect was unintentional? Oh if she wanted to check in on OP she could phone her. I don't know about you but where I am from even INVITED GUESTS knock/ring the doorbell. How on earth can you think MIL'S disrespect was unintentional. She KNEW OP wasn't up for people. This is the first holiday season after HER SON'S DEATH. You say MIL'S actions were wanting to reach out and check in and spend time with them. I disagree. MIL'S were hugely disrespectful, selfish,insensitive & heartless she KNEW OP wasn't up for people. If she wanted to check in she could have phoned/texted. If she wanted to spend time with OP and her husband she could call/text to make arrangements. She then decides to get the family involved when her actions backfire. The family who I'm not sure have the full story", "Why would MIL be grieving? OP's son was not a blood relation of hers, and there's no indication that they were particularly close.", "MIL barged into OP'S home while she was grieving her child and DEMANDED TO BE HOSTED! she even admitted that she timed her arrival to when cooking would be done. That they had come for dinner and to spend some time together. This was the FIRST CHRISTMAS after OP'S son's death. I don't know about you where I'm from even INVITED guests knock/ring the doorbell. They don't just punch in the code and walk right in. How can you possibly think MIL is NOT the asshole.", "Dan is not the father of my children. Mine were almost grown when we got together 5yrs ago. This is my first Christmas since my sons passing and the first year that we weren't having Christmas with MIL. The last 4 we were together without my oldest since he lived in a state across country for school. Most of my family was there so he would spend Christmas with them and do a trip up for new years.", "How is barging into someone else's home while they're grieving their child demanding to be hosted helping. Please explain.", "Didn't even demand to use the kitchen, expected food to already be cooked!", "AND this was probably the FIRST Christmas after OP'S sons death.", "They were not very close. Only a year after me and \"Dan\" got together my oldest moved to another state to start college where we lived most of his life before this final move.", "Not just fed. HOSTED. came for dinner AND spend some time together", "Exactly. \"This is when you'd serve dinner if you were cooking, so we're here to eat. Serve us.\"", "Yeah. MIL is awful", "It is the first Christmas. He passed Easter Night this year.", "Absolutely how I felt. You know this was a dicey situation and you still couldn't give us not even a text of a heads up. And when i say 3.5hrs away is under stating when they drive, that's just normal traffic driving."]}
