This year my oldest son passed away too young. I have been in therapy and have a great mental health team keeping me semi functional as I navigate through this season. We found out Thanksgiving that Im not handling things well so the team really stepped up to keep my mental health in check.\n\nFast forward weeks before christmas MIL send text inviting us over for Christmas. Dan asked me about it and i told him \"i don't want the obligation. I don't know how I will feel that day.\" We expressed my concern and feelings. Nothing back unitl christmas eve. \nShe texts me asking if we are coming tomorrow. I told her if i had to make a choice now then No. If i can handle things tomorrow we will call & bring food so noone is panic to make food. She lives 3.5hrs away. Explained my emtional breaking % manic expisodes that have compounded the issues im struggling with daily. That the Dr changed meds but takes time to get into the system. My world is shattered & she said well you need to get away from the memories for a day. I again told her no i just cant handle being around people right now. It too hard being functional at the moment.\n\nChristmas morning Im wrapped in a blanket w/ the pictures of my two boys crocheting a blanket to help my stress in pajamas. Its like 1pm. When no knock just entered her door code & walked right in. Saying \"she figured since we weren't going to her house that we would be cooking at home & this is usually the time when it's done so they (MIL & husband) are  here to spend time with us and have dinner.\"\n\nLiterally I look at Dan & not in a soft voice said \"What the fuck is your mother doing her\". As if she wasn't even there. I lost my shit, tears were just streaming down in anger. This woman disrespected my home & my wishes to handle my grief my way. I told her to get out & never step foot in the house again. (Note I said never but im a softy) I mean never for right now.\n\nMIL leaves in & Dan starts in about how I was too hard on his. She is well in her 70s and might not have long to go, we never know. That I was an asshole for kicking her out when all she wanted to do was spend time w/ us & comfort me. I am not having it. That level of disrespect & carelessness is unforgiveable at the present time. Dan & I sat down & talked after everything quieter down & he sees why i am so hurt & upset. In turn, he said he will stand by me on my terms of when she is allowed back in the house. MIL went back pulling thw full victim card with the rest of the family. So now the rest of the family are all pissed at me saying im a bitch & asshole for breaking MIL's heart & keeping her son from spending precious holidays together. Am I the asshole?\n\nSide note: I never denied Dan from being able to go or visit anyone. He decided to stay with me so I wasn't alone.", "created_utc": 1703775691, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18svvxa/aita_for_kicking_my_mil_out_of_my_house_on/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your both struggling with how to live right now. You are struggling with an incredible loss, and your MIL is struggling with how to interact with you and her son during this horribly difficult time.\n\nI lost my dad to violence around Christmas many years ago, and I remember literally everyone I loved struggling with how to interact with me. People said and did the weirdest things.\n\nSome people just don't know how to interact with people who are deeply grieving", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How absolutely RUDE to show up uninvited, to LET HERSELF in, and to demand to utilize your kitchen. She definitely was doing this as some sort of power play, considering you had made your wishes abundantly clear.", "INFO: you say that you\u2019ve lost your oldest boy (for which: hugs, I cannot imagine your grief) but that implies more than one child. \n\nNowhere else in your post do you mention your other child (except possibly \u201cMy boy\u2019s crochet\u201d, but that could refer to oldest son + husband). \n\nWhere was your other son (or: other children) when all this was happening?", "Please change your door code for your safety. So sorry!", "I am going to say NAH.  Yes, your MIL barged in, but I think her heart was in the right place.  She's grieving too, since she lost a grandson and wanted to help.  She may have been ham-handed about it but you're all in a bad place.\n\nI'm so sorry about the loss of your boy.  The firsts after death are the hardest.  You were doing what you were doing for your mental health. Going forward be very firm and tell her that you need to be alone for the time being and you will touch base with her later.\n\nHugs to all.", "More Info: This year we did not even decorate inside. No tree no stockings absolutely no decorations. I couldn't handle opening the ornaments and such. The memories of all the Christmas traditions were just too much too bare. This is the first holiday season without my son so I found treating Christmas as an ordinary day just made it go by easier this year.  Well that was the goal at least.", "NTA", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI am glad Dan now understands even a little how horrible this is for you, because it is now his responsibility to protect you from his mother and the rest of his family.\n\nI hope your pain eases soon.", "Her heart may have been in the right place but she completely overstepped and stomped on your fragile peace - she gets what she gets.  NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to be polite to unwanted guests. She walked in, demanded dinner and drove 3.5 hours to do so. She is a boundary stomping asshole.", "I am so sincerely sorry for your loss.  NTA - you explained your situation and she decided she knew better and did it anyway.  You told her she was incorrect.  That is called holding a boundary and you did it well, everyone else can take a hike and cool off.\n\nWishing you peace and comfort going forward. (Also, change your door code)", "NTA it does not matter what the intent of the MIL was, she has no right to barge in to your home like that.", "First of all let me say I am so sorry for your loss.\n\nI'm going to say NAH\n\nYou are all grieving and emotions are running high. MIL probably didn't mean any disrespect and likely just wanted to make sure you were both OK and spend some time with you both and try to take your minds off things. \n\nAnd you are obviously devastated so your reaction is completely understandable.  Sometimes being around people is just too much during the difficult times.  The holidays are always the most difficult time after a loss and everyone has their own way of managing their grief.\n\nI hope that you and MIL are able to open up to each other and communicate those feelings in a way you can both understand and that eventually you can lean on each other in these difficult times.", "NAH\n\nSorry for your loss\n\nYour mother in law was trying to help but she should not have tried to make the decision for you.  Anyone with an ounce of sense will know that people have to grieve in their own way and not try to force them into something.  Their son will have spent many Christmases with them so him missing one to be with you at this time is perfectly reasonable.\n\nHowever you should have been decisive and made your choice not to attend much earlier as you knew weeks ago that deep down you didn't want to go as it was too soon for you.  You kept them in limbo and that's not fair on them.", "NTA so, you were clear with her that you were not up for celebrating, and she decided to *invite herself to dinner at your home*. With *zero* notice, and showed up when she figured food would be ready? Absolutely the fuck not.\n\nEven if you had cooked and food was ready when she showed up, what could possibly make her think that you would have made enough for random guests?\n\nYou are *grieving*, and she needs to learn to respect boundaries.", "NTA.  The audacity! Showing up to someone\u2019s house uninvited expecting dinner is AH enough.  Showing up to someone\u2019s house who is clearly grieving and doesn\u2019t want to \u201cdo\u201d the holiday this year is a flaming AH move no matter what her intentions or feelings are.  If she wanted to see her precious baby that should have been brought up separately and done somewhere else.", "Grieving or not, anytime you show up unannounced (with driving 3.5 hours!) and walk in the door without knocking,, you are the asshole. It does not matter what your intentions are. MIL is definitely the AH here.", "I only had 2 kids both from my ex husband. My boys are grown adults late teens beginning twenties. My younger sob is in another state spending Christmas with his sister who is much younger than him from his biological dad. It was a present for my son i gave him because he really really wanted to spend time with his little sister since the passing of his brother. Their dad split from her mom and they live in a different state so most of their sibling relationship has been video chats. It was his wishes to spend with his sister and I supported it. It was therapeutic to him.", "We did that evening.", "It's not her grandson. Step-grandson eventually, it depends on when OP married her husband. She told in another comment that both her sons where from another relationship.\n\nThe MIL was rude. One does not come unannounced and just come in without knocking. If she wanted to see her son she could just have asked him if he was OK with going to the restaurant near their house for 1-2 hrs.", "The pain of losing a child isn't easy to handle. I'm sure your son doesn't want you to be in pain. I'm sorry for your loss. It's going to be really hard when his birthday comes around.", "We lost my dad 6 months ago. I put up indoor/outdoor decorations to keep up some sort of normality but my sibling didn\u2019t. They didn\u2019t want to decorate. Everyone handles grief differently and the way your MIL disregarded your legitimate feelings is super gross. \n\nSend a mass text to everyone of your previous messages to your MIL and block everyone until the new year. NTA.", "Funny you say that about the lock codes. Once the dust settled it was the first thing to happen.", "So she invites herself to dinner with no notice and shows up when she figures food will be ready, just assuming that they made enough for random guests?\n\nNo.\n\nIf MIL meant no disrespect, she would have *at the VERY least* called ahead and *brought* food.", "If she was trying to help, she would have at tge very least called ahead and brought food.\n\nInstead, she shows up unannounced and uninvited, right when she thinks food will be ready, assuming they just happened to make enough for random guests.", ">Your mother in law was trying to help\n\nHow exactly was she trying to help?  She showed up uninvited expecting to be fed.", "And she drove 3.5 hours to do that. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f That MIL is the ultra AH", "Not just showing up. But timing it so she thinks food will be ready and she can just sit down and eat. Not offer to help. Not bring food. Just expect that food made for two will feed four and the person staying home because they are struggling should do the labour. \n\nNope. Just no. NTA", "She may have been unthinking, rude, concerned whatever I get that based on OPs wishes. I certainly don\u2019t think MIL was the asshole though either.", "Anytime you show up unannounced (with driving 3.5 hours!) and walk in the door without knocking, you are the asshole. It does not matter what your intentions are. MIL is definitely the AH here."]}
