My family moved into a neighborhood when I was 7 years old. It was an HOA neighborhood at the time. In 2010 the neighborhood got together and found out that fully 90% of the owners had no interest in having the HOA. They only maintained a small strip of land at the front of the neighborhood, had allowed the \u201ccommunity center\u201d (basically a 300 sq/ft pavilion built in the early 90\u2019s) to fall over and become a hazard. I\u2019m not completely sure about the process the neighborhood went through, but the HOA was dissolved at the end of 2010 and individual volunteers took over maintenance of the two areas. Fast forward to 2018. I was moving back into the area to take care of my mother and found a house for sale in the neighborhood. The price was good, I bought it, nothing mentioned about covenants or regulations or anything. One of my hobbies is vehicles. I collect, refurbish, and build/modify classic and imported vehicles. One of the reasons I bought the house was the 4 cars worth of garage space. My surviving grandparent passed away the same year and I ended up with one and a half garages worth of family heirlooms and the like stored at my place. This meant that 3 cars ended up in the driveway. Driveway is large, at least 4 cars across and about 8-10 long, with most of that space between my house and detached garage. I have 7 vehicles in the driveway. Within a month I started receiving notices from the county that there were complaints about my property. Nothing actionable by the county, the vehicles are in good repair, running, and registered. I\u2019m just having to deal with the county inspector coming out every month and looking over the vehicles and whatever else people want to nitpick about my property.

Start the proceedings!", "NTA,\n\nThe fact that their complaints are received and actioned, they prob feel that they are in some way still right, the harassment case should clarify that for them", "NTA - If you don't nip that in the bud, they will just continue/escalate until the County inspector finds something actionable, whether they want to or not.  The HOA is gone, the property is yours, the County certainly has more important things to worry about, and the best way to reinforce those points is through the Courts.", "NTA. There is no HOA, they have no grounds for trying to hold you to previous HOA rules. Best of luck dragging them painfully through the court system for harassing you!", "NTA also, whats the point of a big driveway if you can only keep one car on it?", "NTA\n\nYou aren't violating any laws or ordinances.  If you had broken down vehicles sitting on your lawn I could understand their concern but otherwise they don't have a leg to stand on. \n\nTime to give them a taste of their own medicine.", "You are absolutely NTA and also being harassed.", "NTA. These people are wasting your time and the inspector's time.", "NTA. Find out any infractions they might have and don't let up. See how they like it.", "NTA. They have no say. It's your property. If they have such a problem with it, maybe they should stop making a point of looking into your property in search of things to nitpick. Life is less stressful when you keep your nose where it belongs.", "NTA - maybe put up a nice-looking sign saying everything's legit w/your driveway, etc. and future notices of unactionable complaints will be considered harassment. Then they can't claim surprise. When a couple complaints get harassment response, I'd guess they'd decrease, even better if the notice to them is on an attorney's letterhead.", "NTA.\n\nYou aren\u2019t breaking any laws or violating any rules. You\u2019re being harassed by people in your neighborhood on a power trip. In my experience, people who are hard pressed about HOA rules are typically on a power trip and are assholes. You should do whatever you can to make the harassment stop.", "NTA. It sounds like the ex HOA members are power hungry and are angry about it.", "That may be the only way to back them off. The HOA no longer exists so those \u201crules\u201d no longer apply.  Apparently you are not in violation of any state or county regulations, or the inspector would have pointed That out.  That leaves individuals who keep not-picking on you.\n\nthe first step could be a letter from your attorney, advising that they have no basis for their continued complaints, and further complaints will result in legal action against them.  Then, if they persist, your attorney will take it from there.", "NTA...HOAs are the devil, and I'm glad this one is gone. I think underneath all of this, that is, the people who are complaining, is a certain type of temperament that likes everything to be homogeneous. That's what HOAs are usually about. If a nail sticks out, somebody wants to grab a hammer. Your property may be the only one that has seven cars in the driveway. Look around the neighborhood and see if this is the truth. You might want to think about selling one or two, or clearing out the garage space that has all the stuff in it, since it sounds like the beginning of a hoarding situation. Yes, you certainly do have the right to keep your property however you like, especially with no HOA, but it might help to be aware of how you are the exception here, and understand why some people are getting upset about it.", "NTA. You don't belong to an HOA you aren't violating any laws and your neighbours are being jerks.", "NTA. HOAs are stupid, and it disbanded, so you don\u2019t have to follow the rules that don\u2019t exist anymore.

What with how other HOA horror stories have gone, those few folks might've browbeat other newer residents into thinking the HOA is back and paying fraudulent fees.", "NTA. Fight fire with fire and complain about every teeny tiny infraction they make as well. And also tell them you will be pursuing legal charges for their unending stalking and harassment.

Stand up for your rights. Just word of warning, occasionally move the vehicles in your drive to show they are being used. I used to live in an area with only on street parking. I had a neighbor who tried to claim my son's car was abandoned. While my son was at boot camp,I would find chalk marks on a tire so I drove it once a week and switched where my car and his parked.", "Nta\n\nThey are harassing you, and wasting county resources to do it. Next time the county guy stops by, inform him you'll be reviewing your legal options about the harassment, and he might want to inform the person calling.", "NTA. Sounds like you've attracted the attention of the 10% of HOA members that wanted to keep it around so that they could control what other people do with their own property.", "Driveways are for car parking, right? NTA, if they were in the street or yard I might understand, but in the driveway? nah", "NTA, and why does the county inspector keep on coming out when he/she knows the complaints are bogus? Sounds like your neighbors are an actual public nuisance here, with the victim being the government's resources.", "NTA. Certainly sounds like harassment. \u201cHe\u2019s not following these rules that don\u2019t apply!\u201d", "NTA, they need to be on notice that they literally have no power and if it continues you'll file harassment charges.", "NTA Fight back as hard as you're legally allowed. I hope the county eventually takes action against them for their repeated false complaints.", "NTA.", "INFO: did you talk to a lawyer about this? Some covenants run with the land and you want to be sure this isn\u2019t one that fits that category. Might the worth it to consult and also do a title search to find a recorded instrument indicating the HOA is dissolved. If that doesn\u2019t exist there may be some cloud on the title, and may give the old HOA members wiggle room for their argument. And may make it hard for you to sell in the future.", "NTA. They\u2019ll stop complaining after they get the first warning letter. It is harassment.", "Technically, NTA, but you should figure out what to do with the stuff in your garage so you can get some cars back in there. It does look kinda trashy to have a lot of cars in the driveway all the time.", "That's not the former HOA. Your county likely has an ordinance limiting the number of cars a house can have in front of it.", "NTA, I guess. But that\u2019s way too many cars for a residential property", "If they're family heirlooms, you might consider proper storage for your collection. Otherwise nta", "It is considered unsightly and is an protection against AHs putting a bunch of beater vehicles in their driveway.", "Good luck with your neighbors, SixStraightSilver!", "Definitely agreed. I\u2019ve lived in several, they all are predatory organizations generally made up of very unhappy people stuck in the past. I am the only one with 7 cars in the driveway, my house also has the largest driveway, and is one of a small handful with a detached garage. Most of the houses have the driveway straight out from the garage, while mine is actually to the side of the house with the attached garage on the side. I\u2019ve been working through the junk in the garage, it was dumped on me out of nowhere after my grandparents passed and their house was sold, but it\u2019s hard to get family members to let go of things. I definitely accept that I am something of the exception in the neighborhood, and I could easily sell a couple of the cars. I also do know that the vehicles irritate some of my neighbors, most of whom are older. I never had any issue with any of them when it was classic American cars and trucks. The moment I started moving towards imports and the like I started getting hate on nextdoor and the like as well.", "Absolutely will do. The only thing I didn\u2019t really mention in the original post is that in the last two weeks someone slashed all four tires on one of my imports and threw a rock through one of my garage windows. Could be related, and I have cameras up now.", "Definitely makes sense. I know some of the cars don\u2019t get driven because they aren\u2019t street legal, but they\u2019re all registered and tagged as what they are. The neighbors complain every time some of them get fired up even \ud83d\ude02", "The guy had actually stopped coming out for a bit, apparently told the neighbors that they needed to stop as well. They simply started complaining to the county commissioner that the inspector wasn\u2019t doing his job and their property values were being damaged. He was ordered to continue making visits.", "I talked with a lawyer about it several months ago, seems there was some weird regulations around how long I had to wait to file harassment movements, but he couldn\u2019t find any record of covenants being on file and attached to the property at all", "Ive always wondered why people say that. I could understand having a bunch of old rusted out junkers or falling apart garbage looking trashy. moderately high end imports, classics in good condition, built daily drivers, how do these things look trashy? Even with all my garage space filled with cars I\u2019ll still have 3-4 in the driveway", "Why?", "The only regulation pertaining to vehicles is that they have to have valid license plates on them. Already checked about that one", "Why does the number of cars in someone\u2019s driveway affect anyone else? When I\u2019ve got the space for them why would I have any reason to pay for storage?", "Im personally wanting to get rid of most of the junk, it\u2019s other family members who want to keep it all", "What about it is \u201cunsightly\u201d? I\u2019ve got track cars and high end imports, all in the driveway. I could see having cars parked in the yard being unsightly, or garbage piled up, but nice cars, track cars, a trailer for said track cars, etc\u2026 doesn\u2019t seem unsightly.", "Thanks so much \ud83d\ude01", "They don't look trashy at all. People just like to bitch and moan. NTA", "Doesn't make any sense to me, either.", "Ohhhh. I know that drama oh to well. Start making noise about it. Do not be the official storage holder. I regret some of my choices with that.", "Nah. It looks trashy.", "They are going to throw paint or glue at your cars. Do you have cameras?", "I have been lmao. My mum\u2019s been out sorting through a lot of it for several weekends now", "Reasoning?", "I do now. I\u2019d been waiting for a company to install some, I ended up just getting several and putting them up myself after someone slashed some tires and threw a rock through my window. The cameras are set to ping my phone when someone is near now, so I can go threaten them in person \ud83d\ude02", "\u201cMy opinion is fact\u201d is their reasoning.", "That\u2019s all it seems like for sure."]}
