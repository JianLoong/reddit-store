Most people don\u2019t want to live near a hope that looks like trash. \n\nAs far as your particular situation, it sounds like your driveway is filled with cars. That alone isn\u2019t a problem but one, by your own admission, is large and beat up. Another is under a cover which may lead people to associate it with being unsightly. Also yet mention of drift ties being stacked up in the past leads me to believe that was part of the problem. \n\nHere\u2019s one way to approach it. Drive through your neighborhood. Objectively, does your property stick out for reason? Or does it fit in with the 10 or so houses around it? If it sticks out in a negative way, you should consider remedying it. Perhaps renting storage for a few of the vehicles or consider selling several off.", "It just looks ugly. Nobody paid to live next to a parking lot or dealership.

The drift tires were not visible from the road from any angle. The only way for someone to get a good look at either the covered impala or the drift tires would be to walk all the way into the driveway. \nThe property value argument has been debunked so many times it\u2019s not even worth addressing. A house that looks abandoned and damaged is a far cry from a house with a lot of cars. The only thing that sticks out about my house is the fact that the driveway isn\u2019t an empty expanse or concrete. It\u2019s got cars on it. I have no reason or desire to rent storage for vehicles that I can keep at the house. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. Again, it\u2019s my own property.
