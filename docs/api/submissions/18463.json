To say the family adored her would be an understatement. Linda was beautiful, smart and had an amazing sense of humor.\n\nShe\u2019s been part of the family for so long that most of us don\u2019t remember a time without her. Most of our best memories have her in them. \n\nLinda was very close to my nephew Drew (6M). Drew is disabled and autistic, so he has a hard time connecting to other people. I don\u2019t know how to describe the relationship between Drew and Linda, they just sort of clicked, from the moment he was born she was his best friend and would often watch over him. \n\nSadly Linda passed away at the end of January after she was hit by a drunk driver. The entire family was devastated and we are still mourning her. \n\nDrew took it especially hard since he doesn\u2019t really grasp what death means yet. He constantly asks where Linda is and when she\u2019ll be coming back, sometimes going as far as having full blown meltdowns because he misses her so much. He is currently attending therapy to learn how to process his grief but it\u2019s a slow progress. \n\nDrew\u2019s birthday is in 2 weeks, and my sister and BIL sent out invitations to everyone in the family asking who can come. Birthdays are a big deal in our family and are usually an over the top event with catering so it\u2019s necessary to confirm the number of guests. \n\nApparently Ron wrote that he\u2019ll come with Gia, a new girlfriend he is hoping to introduce to the family. \n\nMost of the family is pissed at him for moving on so quickly. I personally think it\u2019s none of my business and I\u2019m not going to tell him what to do or how to live his life, however bringing a new partner over to his nephews birthday when he knows how said nephew was so attached to his ex and is still mourning her, is idiotic at best and cruel at worst.\n\nBIL told Ron that if he\u2019s planning on bringing that girl over for Drew\u2019s birthday he shouldn\u2019t bother coming at all. Ron called me to complain and I told him the same thing, he shouldn\u2019t bring her over. \n\nRon called me an asshole and a bad brother, he said that he\u2019s finally happy again after Linda\u2019s death and why is it so hard for us to accept that he moved on and support his relationship. I told him I\u2019m happy to hear he\u2019s doing well and I\u2019m sure the family would someday love to meet the girl that makes him so happy, but I\u2019m standing by my opinion that inviting her now was a dumb decision on his part and he chose the worst possible time and place to introduce someone new to the family.\n\nEdit: Ron and Linda were still together when she passed away.", "created_utc": 1685379590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v0cum/aita_for_telling_my_brother_it_was_a_dumb/", "score": 2725, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't we meet for dinner next weekend instead?\" Then it's not personal, it's just about Drew and shows you're also interested in your brother and his new gf. Instead y'all pulled a bunch of semi-hostile \"don't bother showing up if you're going to bring her\" stuff. It's abundantly apparent that y'all are judging him and not interested in his SO.", "NAH.

I revise my judgment to ESH.", "NAH. Ron lost his hs sweetheart suddenly and violently. Cut him some slack. He has never as an adult been single until the moment of her death. Being single is much more alien to him than being in a relationship. He would have never thought not to bring his only long term previous gf to a family event. He isn't an AH to not realize, the first time since his late partner's death, that the child isn't ready for it.\n\nAny family mad that he moves on is an AH.

So if the child's therapist believes it would be too much to process at this time, Ron should be accepting of that and back down for now (not forever).\n\nBut everyone who is judging how Ron grieves, how long he grieves, when he chooses to date again sucks.  No two people's grief will ever look alike and people have to process that in a way that is best for them.

I've known people who waited 1, 5, or 10+ years.

It was 100% a shitty coping mechanism and I snapped out of it pretty quickly. Now that it\u2019s been almost a year, I can\u2019t even imagine being ready for a new relationship because I\u2019m actually processing the enormity of who I have lost. \n\nI think the brother has a tsunami of grief coming at him.", "Yeah, honestly, I\u2019m wondering if rushing into this new thing so fast is a form of grief avoidance.\n\nAlso, NTA, OP.", "I noticed men seem to move on faster. I know every widowed guy in my family was remarried/ in serious relationship within a year , while the widows stayed single. My dad was dating... I think 8 months after my mom died, maybe less because he kinda kept it private . And they were together from 1964-1993. Just my observation, I don't have any statistics or anything.", "Rushing into someone's arms is understandable after grief. However it didn't mean you moved on in a healthy way. So if that's the case, he didn't move on. He found a rebound to keep his sadness at bay and I get that. It happened to me when my kitty passed away suddenly and I wanted to adopt immediately thinking that I was ok, but I wasn't. I just wanted to feel happy, those emotions of love and affection again. I waited not it off choice but whichever pet I applied for was already adopted by the time I applied. That time made me realize I wasn't ready and it was hard. It still is\n\nThis is definitely a hot take but I dont believe in a time limit for your grief but I do believe that someone can't just move on a few months after a traffic early death of an intimate partner after over a decade of a relationship. If he was able to healthily get over her and be emotionally ok for another woman that's really sus. Especially being intertwined with a person since highschool oh geez he didn't even get to date. There only way I can see this being the case was of he already had his foot it the door or mentally moved before she passed, or he may have sociopathic tenancies where he is lacking in some emotions", "Plus last time he dated he was at an age where your partner meets the family really quickly. At 16 they usually meet within a couple dates, if not the first one. He didn't date as an adult so likely doesn't know it's different. My partner met my parents within a week of us actually dating (we met online, playing a game and were friends for a couple years. Then he moved to be with me, and that's when he met my parents) we were barely adults at the time and used to how it worked in high school.", "Agreed. I wouldn't be surprised if the reason he wants to bring someone is to avoid the loss at the family event.

His daughter had a bay (she was pregnant before her mum died) , and my partner wanted me to go yo the christening.  Wilst it was nice he wanted me there I was horrified when I found out.

Because from the sounds of it the child is going to be a part of it whether he gets a day or not, the family hasn\u2019t moved on from the partner and it feels like he is going to be the ah no matter what he does or occasion. It feels like the family is subtly trying to pressure him to wait and find another way to cope, instead of allowing him to cope and lose in his own way. Good way to lose a family member when you try to dictate how they should grieve because someone else isn\u2019t comfortable, he should stay away from the party and if they do this again to your brother  maybe you should internalize the thought of \u201care we actually hindering him from coping\u201d.", "Pretty cruel assumption", "Oh so you have no problem not getting attach to anyone that's good.", "NTA, and you don\u2019t even need to look at the issue of moving on quickly and appropriate grief and all that. \n\nIt\u2019s a dumb decision because *it\u2019s likely to really upset the birthday boy*!

They absolutely have the right to feel that for them, it\u2019s too soon for her to come around their own grief and pain.\n\nWhich makes sense - new girlfriend gives love, comfort, sex and companionship to Ron, but she certainly doesn\u2019t give love, comfort, sex and companionship to his family, so there is no attachment to this woman to ease their pain the way she may ease Ron\u2019s, and Ron is incredibly emotionally shortsighted to try and force this now.", "This is why a lot of older widowers/widows remarry so quickly.
