To say the family adored her would be an understatement. Linda was beautiful, smart and had an amazing sense of humor.\n\nShe\u2019s been part of the family for so long that most of us don\u2019t remember a time without her. Most of our best memories have her in them. \n\nLinda was very close to my nephew Drew (6M). Drew is disabled and autistic, so he has a hard time connecting to other people. I don\u2019t know how to describe the relationship between Drew and Linda, they just sort of clicked, from the moment he was born she was his best friend and would often watch over him. \n\nSadly Linda passed away at the end of January after she was hit by a drunk driver. The entire family was devastated and we are still mourning her. \n\nDrew took it especially hard since he doesn\u2019t really grasp what death means yet. He constantly asks where Linda is and when she\u2019ll be coming back, sometimes going as far as having full blown meltdowns because he misses her so much. He is currently attending therapy to learn how to process his grief but it\u2019s a slow progress. \n\nDrew\u2019s birthday is in 2 weeks, and my sister and BIL sent out invitations to everyone in the family asking who can come. Birthdays are a big deal in our family and are usually an over the top event with catering so it\u2019s necessary to confirm the number of guests. \n\nApparently Ron wrote that he\u2019ll come with Gia, a new girlfriend he is hoping to introduce to the family. \n\nMost of the family is pissed at him for moving on so quickly. I personally think it\u2019s none of my business and I\u2019m not going to tell him what to do or how to live his life, however bringing a new partner over to his nephews birthday when he knows how said nephew was so attached to his ex and is still mourning her, is idiotic at best and cruel at worst.\n\nBIL told Ron that if he\u2019s planning on bringing that girl over for Drew\u2019s birthday he shouldn\u2019t bother coming at all. Ron called me to complain and I told him the same thing, he shouldn\u2019t bring her over. \n\nRon called me an asshole and a bad brother, he said that he\u2019s finally happy again after Linda\u2019s death and why is it so hard for us to accept that he moved on and support his relationship. I told him I\u2019m happy to hear he\u2019s doing well and I\u2019m sure the family would someday love to meet the girl that makes him so happy, but I\u2019m standing by my opinion that inviting her now was a dumb decision on his part and he chose the worst possible time and place to introduce someone new to the family.\n\nEdit: Ron and Linda were still together when she passed away.", "created_utc": 1685379590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v0cum/aita_for_telling_my_brother_it_was_a_dumb/", "score": 9371, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why don't we meet for dinner next weekend instead?\" Then it's not personal, it's just about Drew and shows you're also interested in your brother and his new gf.

So if the child's therapist believes it would be too much to process at this time, Ron should be accepting of that and back down for now (not forever).\n\nBut everyone who is judging how Ron grieves, how long he grieves, when he chooses to date again sucks.

I've known people who waited 1, 5, or 10+ years.

I waited not it off choice but whichever pet I applied for was already adopted by the time I applied. That time made me realize I wasn't ready and it was hard. It still is\n\nThis is definitely a hot take but I dont believe in a time limit for your grief but I do believe that someone can't just move on a few months after a traffic early death of an intimate partner after over a decade of a relationship.

At 16 they usually meet within a couple dates, if not the first one. He didn't date as an adult so likely doesn't know it's different. My partner met my parents within a week of us actually dating (we met online, playing a game and were friends for a couple years. Then he moved to be with me, and that's when he met my parents) we were barely adults at the time and used to how it worked in high school.", "Agreed.

That doesn't mean it's an autism thing. It's a personality thing. Kids under 7 don't have the ability to jump into the next developmental stage of cognitive development. At age 7 to 11, you are in the formal operational stage of cogdev which means you're only now starting to think of and understand concrete reasoning and logic based thinking. That stage this child hasn't even ENTERED yet also includes inductive reasoning. Abstract thought and understanding isn't even until the final stage that begins at age 12.\n\nThis child is in the preoperational stage. This is entirely normal behavior for a child unable to understand death, which is abstract. \nThis stage is most identified as the egocentric stage where a child doesn't have the ability to, on their own, think of other people's perspectives and only think of what something is making them feel. I.e. \"I'm not seeing this person anymore, that makes me upset, I am upset now\" and not \"This person is gone forever, that makes me sad, I am upset because they are gone forever.\"\n\n\nA child reacting appropriately for their age is no reason to blame autism for it. The only thing that the autism explains from what you've said is the \"meltdowns\" which are a sensory reaction autistics deal with.\nThese come from us having a lot of reaction and a lot of feelings that we don't yet have the tools to process. \nBut that child not understanding the concreteness of death or what death does or means isn't autism. Age 6 is entirely normal for a \"forever\" issue not to be understood. \n\n\nNow, onto yall being TAs. \n\nCan you not just out yourself, a neurotypical person, in another neurotypical person's shoes?

Never find love or solace in another again?\nWhat is the time frame your family would \"allow\" him to love again? \n\nYes, it would be inappropriate for a new person to come to the CHILD'S party because they're too young to cope with their feelings yet. But no, it is not inappropriate for him to somehow have managed the task of opening himself up after something so horrible. Your family members should have taken this stance instead of being upset that he's opened up to someone. \n\nBecause you know what he could have done? Fallen into a depression, lost a job, turn to drugs or liquor, become suicidal, etc. A death of that magnitude could have destroyed your brother. Your family members should be extremely happy that he's found someone worthy of helping him recover from this loss instead of the COUNTLESS bad paths he could have taken.\n\nHave some big family cookout or a smaller family dinner instead for her to come into the family with. She does deserve to know y'all. At least give her a chance to meet y'all in an appropriate setting. It speaks volumes that he trusts her this much to want your family to meet her. There is no bringing his late gf back. And he will suffer with that for the rest of his life. There's no closure for those situations. It's not like she cheated or she broke up with him. \n\nEverything was perfect before she was suddenly gone. But he sees this new gf as someone worthy of your FAMILY. It takes a lot to see someone that seriously. It also takes a lot not to give into the bad paths once we lose the love of our life. \n\nDon't let your family punish him for finding love, one of the things we always feel is impossible after losing someone so special in such a tragic way. And be proud that he also decided to live after that loss. It takes a lot of strength just to do that, let alone allow anyone into your life. It's a huge step. So they shouldn't villainous him for taking that step. Taking the chance that he could lose her too. That's full of so many risks. All the \"will it happen again if I let someone in, will I be hurt again, I can't handle losing someone else this way, what if she also is taken\" and more. Many people stay alone for decades or even forever JUST at the fear that they could be hurt by life again. \n\nTake that first step and meet her at a lunch or something with him. See who she is without comparing her to the lost love of his life. He shouldn't stay alone forever if he has this chance to heal and grow. He can't lose his family too, just because he allowed himself to open up to another.\n\nThere are no timeframes that fit all situations. So be that bridge since you're not angry at him for allowing himself to try to maybe find happiness again. I've got a strong feeling that you won't regret that.", "YTA\u2026.the whole family making it about them when your brother is the one who lost his partner\u2026.he\u2019s only young and he\u2019s entitled to move on\u2026the autistic baby\u2019s is literally a year old\u2026yes I\u2019m sure he\u2019s probably effected but he\u2019s 1\u2026.how does a 1 year old get therapy for grief?

Hell, I had a friend with a young child that I *knew well* and still felt weird about going to their birthday party because I was an adult without a child and the kid probably wouldn\u2019t care whether I was there or not and knew I was there to keep her parents company more than anything. I still went and got kiddo a gift because I do know and love her but it still felt weird attending a large gathering for a kid as an adult without kids.\n\nEven introducing a new significant other by inviting them for a family gathering like a wedding or a holiday like Christmas or Thanksgiving has always made me wildly uncomfortable. I just can\u2019t understand putting the pressure of meeting someone for the first time centered around holidays or special events that are typically meant for family and close friends, when that person has yet to establish either of those types of relationships with anyone other than their new SO.  \n\nTo then add in the factors of grieving the deceased who the child was close to, the elements of it being a brand new person and an autistic child, I think it\u2019s even more wildly inappropriate. There\u2019s just no consideration being done there on the brothers part, not only to the kid, but also to his girlfriend. Like how would she end up feeling when the kid has a meltdown at her simple presence because if he understood Linda was his uncles girlfriend, and now a new person is introduced in that role when the kid hasn\u2019t processed how or why Linda had disappeared? I don\u2019t mean to make her sound as important as the kids feelings, I just think that she\u2019ll also end up being hurt by that interaction and it\u2019ll be a poor way to meet her for the first time for everyone involved.", "Some men simply cannot be alone. They can compartmentalize their feelings and move on. It's the lack of empathy on his part that's so infuriating.", "Not to mention, unfair to the new girlfriend!  He's putting her in an impossible position.", "Honestly, it would be thoughtless even if the kid was NT. He had a strong bond with Linda and is still a grieving child. Bringing a replacement to his party is bad all around, but extra bad in this scenario.", "Exactly - the same reason people want to announce pregnancies and engagements at other people's weddings.", "I mean, if your uncle shows up and is being romantic with/close to someone and introduces them as that partner, and you have been missing your aunt-figure for months now...wouldn't that make you ask where she was repeatedly? Or get upset seeing him being with someone else? 6 is old enough to understand romantic relationships to a degree where you might get upset seeing the \"wrong\" set of people acting that way.\n\nIts a lot of stress to put on a child and I agree full stop it's the worst time to introduce the lady.", "This was my thought process as well.", "Yup. Old saying: \n\n\"Widows grieve. Widowers replace.\"", "I have a cousin that can't seem to not be in a serious relationship. He just doesn't function well as an adult alone.

Idk if I\u2019d ever get over it but that\u2019s not everyone. Some people grieve differently it\u2019s not your place to put YOUR arbitrary timelines on other people. Everyone in this thread is attacking this dude because he wants to move on with his life. Life is short he could die tomorrow just as suddenly. It\u2019s HIS choice it doesn\u2019t really matter how YOU feel about it", "More likely the nephew - who doesn\u2019t grasp that Linda is dead - will blame the new partner and his uncle for making Linda go away. The concrete reason, which he can understand, superseding the abstract idea of death. Also, Linda going away means Linda isn\u2019t totally gone, which allows Drew to keep hoping.", "The uncle does have the obligation not to hijack the grieving child's birthday in order to celebrate his new relationship.  \n\nIt's a disaster waiting to happen.  And it falls under the general concept of not hijacking anyone else's celebration for one's own ends.  You don't propose at a wedding.  You don't announce a pregnancy at someone else's birthday.  You don't, in general, take the spotlight off of the primary celebrant for your own ends. \n\nAnd it becomes more serious because of the nephew's disability, and the known fact that he was very close to Linda, and is having a very hard time adjusting.  \n\nThe brother can move on.  But the rest of the family has the right to say \"if you're going to mess up a child's birthday with this, DON'T COME.\"  They don't have to enable deliberate cruelty to a child just because it makes the brother happy.  \n\nAnd if the brother had two-cents worth of common sense, he'd realize just how awful the idea of introducing the new girlfriend at the nephew's birthday was.", "Here you go, I did it for you. \n\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8807029/", "I'm not generalizing literally give it a goog lol", "Except the family IS giving Ron grief for his new GF in general", "They're being pedantic.

I know this isn't exactly the same thing, but I was cheated on by a long time partner and I had such a sick/empty feeling in my stomach that I tried to go on a date 3  days after hoping for some relief. In the end I backed out as I knew I qadmt I'm a good spot, but I can understand how someone could get there.", "I can\u2019t imagine introducing someone to my family who I\u2019ve been seeing for less than 4 month, never mind the late girlfriend of 11 years part.", "It\u2019s actually not uncommon for widowers to move on fairly quickly after their wife or partner passes away.", "Honest question \u2026 why not also lose faith in women?

They don't really know love. They just meet the first person and make themselves all about them. As the partner once you realise the details of it all you feel incredibly unspecial because it could have been anyone if it wasn't you. \nI feel bad for Gia, this man is still grieving for sure and he's grief rebounded fast as hell- it's been 4 months and it's not like this is a first date it's now an introduce to family moment.

I knew she was going to go eventually, sooner rather than later - so while getting her put down hurt it wasn't that bad. I was expecting it- had been doing so increasingly more so over winter- and had already begun the grieving process.\n\nI lost one of my three year old cats under anesthesia to clear an urinary blockage about a week ago.

Your brother lost his gf of 11 years, grief is different in everyone and he might not know how to be alone. From the outside it may seem like he just moved on but as you said all your best memories involved Linda. It might be scary for him to be at a birthday or event alone without her. That being said it is totally appropriate to tell your brother that this is not the right time or place to introduce his new gf. Maybe instead of being angry with your brother try to talk to him and understand. Yes, y\u2019all lost a family member but he lost his intimate partner.

I think it\u2019s harder to move on from close friends and family passing than a relationship, for a few reasons. Close family and friends occupy a completely different place in your heart than a relationship. If I were to pass I wouldn\u2019t want my partner to stew in it for an absurd amount of time. I\u2019d want them to live their life and be happy. And if that\u2019s with another person to be there for them and help them through the flare of them so be it.
