To say the family adored her would be an understatement.

I don\u2019t know how to describe the relationship between Drew and Linda, they just sort of clicked, from the moment he was born she was his best friend and would often watch over him. \n\nSadly Linda passed away at the end of January after she was hit by a drunk driver. The entire family was devastated and we are still mourning her. \n\nDrew took it especially hard since he doesn\u2019t really grasp what death means yet. He constantly asks where Linda is and when she\u2019ll be coming back, sometimes going as far as having full blown meltdowns because he misses her so much. He is currently attending therapy to learn how to process his grief but it\u2019s a slow progress. \n\nDrew\u2019s birthday is in 2 weeks, and my sister and BIL sent out invitations to everyone in the family asking who can come. Birthdays are a big deal in our family and are usually an over the top event with catering so it\u2019s necessary to confirm the number of guests. \n\nApparently Ron wrote that he\u2019ll come with Gia, a new girlfriend he is hoping to introduce to the family. \n\nMost of the family is pissed at him for moving on so quickly. I personally think it\u2019s none of my business and I\u2019m not going to tell him what to do or how to live his life, however bringing a new partner over to his nephews birthday when he knows how said nephew was so attached to his ex and is still mourning her, is idiotic at best and cruel at worst.\n\nBIL told Ron that if he\u2019s planning on bringing that girl over for Drew\u2019s birthday he shouldn\u2019t bother coming at all. Ron called me to complain and I told him the same thing, he shouldn\u2019t bring her over. \n\nRon called me an asshole and a bad brother, he said that he\u2019s finally happy again after Linda\u2019s death and why is it so hard for us to accept that he moved on and support his relationship. I told him I\u2019m happy to hear he\u2019s doing well and I\u2019m sure the family would someday love to meet the girl that makes him so happy, but I\u2019m standing by my opinion that inviting her now was a dumb decision on his part and he chose the worst possible time and place to introduce someone new to the family.\n\nEdit: Ron and Linda were still together when she passed away.", "created_utc": 1685379590, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13v0cum/aita_for_telling_my_brother_it_was_a_dumb/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
