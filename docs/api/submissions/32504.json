{"id": 32504, "submission_id": "18cobdn", "title": "AITA for telling my father he has been dead to me for some time now?", "selftext": "He left me(17) and mom two years ago. Was cheating on her with her former friend for a long time before the divorce. New wife actually asked him to no longer see me since she's worried seeing me would remind my father of my mom and my father agreed with her, before changing his mind and having me visit again after over a year of no contact. He never defended me though whenever his wife talked about how I was too thin, or that my hair was too messy, or that I should wear better clothes. He let her call my mom 'ugly, fat bitch' in front me and many other horrible things. She'd tell him he made the right choice 'trading up' for her and he'd just nod along, afraid of upsetting her.\n\nLast week, she said she'd like to apologise for her past behaviour by cooking dinner for me. This made me suspicious since she never apologised and every time I visit them I buy my own food from a nearby store. I told her no thanks but she insisted. I told her I'm vegetarian, which is true, but she said she can cook vegetarian food.\n\nShe didn't cook vegetarian food. She cooked rabbit stew, knowing I have a pet rabbit. My father just sat there awkwardly. I could tell it wasn't his idea and that he's just going along with what his wife wants, just nodding along, but that still set me off. So I called her a piece of shit and called him a useless coward, and then I left.\n\nYesterday, he asked if I'd visit him again. He said he tried to talk her out of it but she told him that I have to understand that not everyone love rabbits. At that point I snapped. I told him I don't expect everyone to love rabbits, but I already told her I'm vegetarian and said that I'd buy my own food, but she still insisted on cooking for me and deliberately cooked rabbit stew when she knew I have a rabbit. I called him a pussywhipped prick then told him he can go to hell for all I care and that he has been dead to me for a long time now.\n\nMy sister(23) said I was too harsh, and that our father should be here tomorrow when I turn 18. She said that \"he's still our father. He raised us and looked after us for many years before he left.\" Was I too harsh, given that he is my father?", "created_utc": 1701926322, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cobdn/aita_for_telling_my_father_he_has_been_dead_to_me/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Assuming that he does care about you, (in his own way or whatever) he clearly cares more about his new wife. NTA", "NTA. This man is not acting like a father, and is allowing you to be bullied and abused by his new wife. Don\u2019t let him anywhere near you.", "NTA you weren't harsh enough! You should call him back and really let him have it", "You were not harsh enough.", "NTA your father deserves much harsher than this. SM is down right evil. Like Snow White evil stepmother level.", "NTA wash your hands of him unless he every really apologizes and changes", "NTA. He should be able to understand that your emotions are valid and come from pain. In the future, if you do decide to renew contact with him, definitely consider keeping his wife out of the picture.", "NTA and your sister should mind her business.", "NTA- cooking a rabbit for someone who has a pet rabbit and a vegetarian is just cruel.\n\nThat must have been traumatizing to you and I'm sorry you had to experience that.\n\nAnd your father sat by and let that occur.  You're not going to forget that.  You know when your heart that if something is traumatic to you, your father's going to sit by and let it.", "As long as he\u2019s with her, he\u2019s poison.

NTA.", "NTA", "NTA your sister has her experience with your father. And you have a drastically different one. Your father has been failing you for years and you are old enough to not have to continue to out yourself in situations where he disapoints you.\nYour stepmother is abusive, and your father is complicit in that abuse by doing nothing.", "NTA, your sis needs to go to your father and his gf the way you did and learn the hard way he's dead to both of you.", "Just walk away if he starts talking to you. Let him know that there nothing there for him and that you're dead to him. As far as he should be concerned he son died last year.", "NTA - if someone has a food intolerance or allergy it is catered to. If I\u2019m remembering right, after being vegetarian for a long while someone\u2019s body could lose the ability to process meat. \n\nAlso deadbeat dads aren\u2019t parents, they are sperm donors and he made the choice to go no contact first, just because he changed his mind doesn\u2019t mean anything is owed on your end", "Definitely NTA. I'd give the stepmom \"scorched earth\" or \"nuclear winter.\"", "NTA. I don't think you were too harsh. He got exactly what he deserved because he let his wife treat you like that. She knew you were vegetarian, and she chose to cook for you a rabbit. If her intention was an FU to you for being a vegetarian, she could have chosen anything else, but she purposely tried to be cruel to you just one more time. He didn't try hard enough to make her change her mind. I hope your words really got to him, and he realises what a piece of work of a wife he has. Your sister is wrong, if she can forgive him for what he did, that's her choice, but you don't have to \"suck it up\" just because he's you dad and he just sits and watches how his wife treats you.", "NTA.\n\nHe might be your father, but he's certainly not behaving like a good one.\n\nTried to talk her out of it? \n\nHe let you walk into that ambush. Forget it.\n\nI would accept nothing less than a divorce if he wants me in his life.", "A little harsh I think. Remember he is your father and you don\u2019t have to agree with the things he does or says to you. But you do have to respect him. His new wife I feel is using your own emotions against you in front of him. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t give them anything to go on. Playing on your emotions can be used to your own advantage. Also, set more boundaries and make it clear if they are violated in any way then your time visiting will be limited. Maybe you can ask his new wife. \u201c what\u2019s it like being labeled a homewrecker\u201d? Make it known loud and clear that her playing\u201d home maker \u201c is bullshit in your eyes.
