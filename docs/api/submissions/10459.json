We could choose our partners so I (17 F) ended up working with my friend Anna (17 F) and 2 boys (17 M).\n\nSome background on Anna: unlike me she doesn't take school seriously and doesn't care about grades as long as she passes the class. She doesn't do her homework at home and only does it at school in the morning or during breaks and classes.\n\nAfter class I created a group chat so we can talk and decide who does what. We assigned our parts and that was it. We had 4 weeks to do it so plenty of time. On the night before the presentation we sent our work on the group chat so everyone can see what the others have done. The only one who didn't send anything was Anna. She said she was busy and tired and that we will see her part of the project at school. I thought that was weird but didn't insist on it. The next morning when I arrive at school I see Anna writing on sheets of paper. I approached her, said good morning and asked what she was writing. At first I thought it was a new story because she likes to write in her free time, but no, it was the project. I asked her why she was writing it and she said she didn't do it until now because \"she was busy\". She probably saw the worried look on my face because she told me it will be ok and it will turn out well. I looked at the boys who I was working with and saw that they were upset too but didn't say anything. \n\nHere is where I might be the AH: I snapped and yelled at her saying that she had plenty of time to do the project but decided to waste time as usual on nothing and because of her we might fail (our teacher fails everybody on the group if one part is not done right), all while sobbing. She got upset saying that she was busy with house chores (she lives alone) and hanging out with her boyfriend (which she does all the time). I again said some bad things about how once in a lifetime she couldn't take school seriously and some other things I can't remember. Some other classmates had to take me away and calmed me down. 4th period comes and it's time to present our project. Me and the boys did it first, Anna was last. She kept  stuttering and looking at the text, when the point was to present freely and just have the materials on us. Lo and behold, we failed. I started crying again and after class she came to me and apologized saying she will talk to the teacher and everything. I was to upset to say anything and just left.\n\nSome of my friends say I was an asshole and that it's just a grade, but others and my boyfriend agree with me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for yelling at my friend and causing a scene?", "created_utc": 1676899044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1176f4h/aita_for_snapping_at_my_classmate_for_not_doing/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can you appeal this? And don't work with your friend again. NTA. I would be furious too.", "NTA. Am I taking crazy pills here? What is with these ESH comments?\n\nLook, these kids are 17. They're at an age where a failing grade can ABSOLUTELY have an impact, and a harsh one at that depending on which class this is in and what their plans after school are. This girl had **four freaking weeks** to get off her butt and get this project done, and she thought nonchalantly scribbling half-arsed notes on a sheets of paper that morning was acceptable because she \\*\\*checks notes\\*\\* \"had chores and a boyfriend to hang out with?\" I don't blame OP one bit for lashing out because frankly, friend needed to hear the harsh truth: she screwed you guys over and didn't feel properly guilty until after she got embarrassed by her own poor performance.\n\nTo the people saying OP should have kept cool and helped friend fudge the assignment last minute that morning, no. Four weeks, people- she had **four weeks** to get this project finished. It's not on OP and the two other boys to help cover her arse the morning of when she couldn't be bothered.\n\nThat being said...\n\nUnfortunately, OP, I've known too many teachers like this to think talking to them will do much good :/   Most teachers I know with this grading policy end up giving distressed students with a dead-weight group member some BS about working as a group and being equally responsible for each other's contributions and keeping one another accountable, and refusing to change the policy or the grade.  I could very well be wrong, but I wouldn't hold my breath here. Consider this a VERY harsh lesson for the future- don't choose people like this for projects that are vital to your grade/work performance. Friendship or not, this person did have a pattern of behavior and sadly, you've learned your friendship is not enough to shake them out of it. I'm sorry that happened, and best of luck to you kiddo.", "Unfortunately, you made two mistakes. You knew Anna didn't care about school or projects and picked her to be your partner anyway. And second, no one checked in until the night before the due date.\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. She deserved a dressing-down. And it's not fair at all that you failed because of someone else.", "NTA, \nDoing chores and hanging out with boyfriend can be postponed.\n\nNgl, it's sounds like she just didn't care or forgot the whole project and just kept making up excuses. Maybe bad at managing her time or procrastinating?\nYou can always meet your boyfriend or do house chores later, I'm pretty sure parents would let her do homework before house chores and her boyfriend would have understood her being busy.\nShe could have also asked him to do it together, so they can still spend time with each other.\n\nIn the end she choose not to do the homework rather than finding a solution to even start it.", " NTA  I understand you got caught up in the moment.   I probably would have had some words too \n\nYou mentioned she lives alone.  Is that recent? Maybe that has impacted why she slacks off on projects when your comment said she never used to.  Living alone in high school would be challenging\n\nUltimately this is a lesson right here on project management and working as a team.  A lesson you can take with you to college and a workplace.  As a group of 4 there should have been a plan to check progress during the 4 weeks not the night before. That doesn\u2019t give Anna an excuse for not pulling her weight but knowing she doesn\u2019t share your work ethic it was a big gamble to leave the sharing of work till the night before the presentation was due", "NTA, you are about to go to college, or at least a job (I would think) and this grade could matter a lot for your future. When Anna knows about the teachers grading style and what can happen, that she will affect other people's lives then she is being a huge AH.\n\nSure maybe you shouldn't have lashed out, but that is something that seems a bit necessary for this situation.", "NTA\n\nYour teammate is an asshole and your teacher is one too. She is an asshole for putting her work off until the last moment. She ruined your presentation. Your teacher is also one for not providing you a chance to evaluate your group members and for failing everyone if one part is wrong.\n\nI can\u2019t tell from the post if you had more than one meeting or not before turning work in. When you have a weak member, it\u2019s important to have more meetings. That\u2019s to figure out if they are doing their work or not. Especially with the teacher you have, you and your team members could have intervened sooner to save your grade.", "NTA, don't worry about it bud. Sounds like you take school quite seriously and are looking to get a good education and secure a good future but this is just one project, hopefully it doesn't bring your average grade too far down.\n\nRegarding the issue, hanging out with your boyfriend is not an excuse to not get work done. Yeah you snapped at her but you're allowed to react emotionally to bullshit sometimes.", "NTA Absolutely not. This selfish lazy girl made all of you fail. She got what she had coming. Although I like to point out that you're the one who chose her knowing how lazy she is.", "NTA, but obviously could have been handled better. It\u2019s a learning moment, you are in a bad situation, it seems you might have even expected it, or you were just reaffirming what you said to her with your background story of her being lazy and not pulling her weight. \n\nEither way, that moment when emotions take over help figure out what kind of person you will be, and don\u2019t worry, because everyone can change. I would coach you in that moment of helplessness where you feel the most betrayed or hurt to see how you can constructively move forward.\n\nHaving an emotional break and speaking from the heart though it felt justified at the time you likely would have been better served trying to help her collect her thoughts and build a plan to talk to the teacher as a whole group. If she was willing to take the blame after you said what you said she would have been even more likely to fall on her sword if you guys tried to help. Also, the teacher may or may not care, but I feel if you do the right thing, more often than not it will work out better in the end.\n\nYou are not the asshole here, but you also still can improve along with your friend.", "NTA, but why would you choose to work with her if you know she sucks at getting work done?", "Anna is the asshole...and it's not just a grade , u put in hard work to get good scores so u can get better college opportunities  etc..\n\nAlso I would like to add why did the teacher fail u...considering  atleast 3/4th of it went well right...even of she dint assign seperate grades which I think she should based on how a person presents  but still fail is a bit extreme for most of it having done decently\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that in future take it as a lesson that when there is a group project , get people to update their part every week so u can not only know people r taking ti seriously  but also proof read and see if there are any mistakes n suggestions...specially  considering  u all 4 get the same grade regardless of individual  work", "ESH\n\nAnna should have put more effort into the project knowing that other people were relying on her.  I was similar to her in high school in that I didn't take it too seriously and never did homework, but when others relied me I would step up for them out of guilt. \n\nThat being said, the people around you are right. It's just a single grade in a single class.  5 years from now none of this will matter.  Certainly not something to flip out and break into tears over.  And let's not forget you chose her as she is her friend.  You knew these qualities about her going in and you still wanted to work with her; maybe you should have chosen more carefully. \n\nOne thing you should ask yourself: is this worth losing a friend over?", "ESH.\n\nYou knew Anna was an academic slacker, and you *chose* to team up with her. Then neither you, nor anyone else in the group, followed up with each other to ensure that each member of the group was working in their portion, and were making progress. You waited until the last possible minute to bother checking in a known slacker, and then just shrugged your shoulders when it was quite clear she didn't have anything to show you. If you had started following up and pushing Anna from Day 1, you could have reported her to the teacher weeks before the project was due, giving you a *much* lower chance of her laziness impacting your grade. \n\nHopefully, you've learned from this that you do NOT work with friends in a project if they aren't as motivated as you. Ever.", "ESH\n\nAnna is seventeen and lives alone? She sees her parents \u2026 three times a year? That\u2019s not an easy life. \n\nThat said, even if she was \u201cjust lazy\u201d - you chose her to work with knowing that she struggles to keep up with school. \n\nShould she have held up her end? Sure. But it\u2019s weird to set yourself up to fail (what you did by choosing her) and then be mad when you do. You start your post off by saying you know Anna to do x and y thing and then you got mad at her for doing exactly that.", "YTA. You know Anna doesn\u2019t make school a priority, yet you chose to do the project with her and assumed this time would magically be different.  Dumb decision.  At the very least you should have spoken to her up front and said you will only partner with her if she agrees to a weekly meet with you to work together on it.  You all need to speak to the teacher now to find out if you can salvage your grade.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your friend should have done the work as she was supposed to do, but you should not have publicly come unglued on her right before you all were to present the project. Your frustrations are definitely understood. I would be pissed also, but publicly yelling at someone and crying doesn't solve anything.

I learned early on, that if I wanted a good grade, I had to make sure that I did the work.\n\nI was in a history of the US in the 20th century class, and we had to do a project. I am very interested in disease, and around this time a new book and PBS special had come out about the polio years. My father suffered from polio, so I was very into this. My assigned partner for this project was in another class where she was doing a project on Franklin Roosevelt. I told her I really wanted to do a project on polio, and I would do every other aspect of the project, if she would write up text about Roosevelt's involvement with polio. (In case you don't know, Roosevelt was paralyzed with polio, and as a result became the face for the initial fundraising programs for research into a polio vaccine.)\n\nSo I wrote articles on the history of polio and the mechanics of the disease, and how the public reacted to it, and the formation of the national foundation for infantile paralysis, and Sister Kenny, and Jonas Salk, and the vaccine trials,\u2026 and she disappeared. And two weeks before the project was due, I had to go and write her stuff.", "2 years ago both of her parents went abroad to work, so she is used by it now.

It's about team work, but in these all or nothing scenarios covering your arse in important too. I'd lean towards E S H if you were older. (What if someone had been in a crash or gotten mono? What was the backup plan?)\n\nEmotions were running high and hopefully the teacher will reconsider if Anna takes responsibility, but ultimately it was a *group* project.

You had 4 weeks you could\u2019ve chosen to check in with eachother earlier or find time outside of school to work on the project. If she was struggling on her part you could have helped her. Group projects are more meant to teach you how to work together and real life personalities and how to work around them are a real situation.
