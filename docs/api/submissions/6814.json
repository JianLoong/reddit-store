{"id": 6814, "submission_id": "106kxv6", "title": "AITA for using the kitchen blender while a houseguest is sleeping?", "selftext": "I am 26F living in a house with two roommates.  One roommate (25M) is my significant other, and the other (24M) is my SO\u2019s childhood friend.  There\u2019s a fourth party here (houseguest, 25M), but I\u2019ll get to him shortly. \n\n\nI am currently enrolled in an evening law school program and work full time, which means that most days I leave the house at 7:30am and get home around 10pm.  In an effort to cut down on fast food consumption and to curb extra spending on food, I do a lot of meal prep.  Most mornings I make myself a giant smoothie with spinach, yogurt, and an assortment of frozen fruits to keep me full throughout the day.  I\u2019ve been doing this for about a month now, and it\u2019s never been an issue with my two roommates.  The blender is a nutribullet blender if that matters, and isn\u2019t too terribly loud.\n\n\nThis houseguest sleeps on the couch in our shared living space, and can stay for up to a week at a time.  The houseguest and I have a cordial relationship where we say hello to one another, but that\u2019s about it because when I\u2019m home I\u2019m usually either sleeping or studying after a long day.  I don\u2019t normally care about him staying for a few days, but I\u2019m never given any warning to when he is coming over or given an estimate for how long he will stay.  He is also \u201cnocturnal\u201d and sleeps until 4pm or 5pm every day after going to bed around 6am or 7am.  This wouldn\u2019t be a contentious matter, but I use the blender at about 7:15am to make my smoothie.  I can\u2019t wait until later in the morning to make my smoothie because I need to be at my job at 8:30am sharp, and leaving after 7:30am would make me late.  I have never been asked by the houseguest to stop using the blender, and have never seen him stir when I walk past him/the couch when I leave in the morning. \n\n\nMy other roommate (24M) sent me a passive aggressive text yesterday saying that I should stop making my morning smoothie because it keeps the houseguest up.  Truthfully I was a little concerned that I was interrupting his sleep schedule, but also don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal because I use the blender for only 5 minutes each day.  Also, neither my roommate nor the houseguest are concerned about being quiet when I am trying to sleep or study (12am - 7am is usually when I sleep) and I\u2019ve brought this up to my roommate in a respectful manner.  He sometimes ignores my text messages when I do this, and the roommate will also sometimes ignore my significant other\u2019s request for quiet.  \n\n\nI plan on continuing to use my blender to make my smoothies, but I also don\u2019t want to be a selfish jerk.  I don\u2019t think that using my blender in the morning is selfish, but now I\u2019m second guessing myself.  I also own the blender, if that counts for anything.

As it is, he pays nothing and you get nothing out of him being there. Blend away!", "NTA.   The roommate sends you a text asking you to stop using a blender because it disturbs the guy sleeping on the couch.  Well to bad.

If he wants peace he will make your smoothie as soon as you get up for you, then he can go to bed in peace.", "NTA.  As a nocturnal person who tends to work night or graveyard shifts, you have to adapt to the rest of the world going on around you.  Noise canceling headphones, earplugs, regular headphones with a white noise app.  I\u2019ve also been a houseguest with that schedule and scolding my hosts for getting ready for work in the morning is outrageous.  Your roommate is out of line for bringing it up to you instead of encouraging the guest to get earplugs.", "Since it\u2019s the roommate with the problem, ask your houseguest if the noise bothers him. Important; Do this in front of the roommates. He\u2019ll likely say no (even if it does a little) and the issue is solved. \n\nIf he says yes, then give him the recipe/ingredients to your smoothie and he can make it at 6:45am right before he goes to sleep.  Win/win!\n\nMy guess is that this is actually the roommate\u2019s issue and is using the houseguest as an excuse. Also, NTA", "NTA. You actually live there, it sounds like this guest is a guest of your roommate, so they can monopolize your roommate\u2019s bedroom instead of the common space of the house that, again, you pay to utilize.
