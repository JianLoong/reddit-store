Growing up, I was the Golden child. I wasn't mean to my siblings or anything and i frequently stood up for them against my parents, but you can't change aweful people. My siblings were constantly ignored or belittled while I had everything I could have wanted. I recognized this from an early age. At 18, I left home, blocked my parents and got therapy. \n\nThat brings us to now. 2 of my siblings, Dee(29f) and Jay(28m) reached out to me a few months ago and I thought we were building a nice relationship but I was wrong. Dee and Jay decided I needed to pay restitution for their childhoods because I'm doing well for myself. They say it's all because of my parents but I think it's because of all the work I put in. I spent all of my time studying and working, making a name for myself. \n\nThis sparked a huge argument. I told them while I do love them, it's not my job to support them and if they want money, they need to work for it just like I did. They have both been harassing me ever since, getting our other siblings involved and telling me I'm just like our parents. I do feel bad for them but I wasn't the one who mistreated them.

You left home at 18 and cut contact with your parents, yes? So I\u2019m assuming that means they didn\u2019t spend the next 2-8 years paying for your college / university education, correct?\n\nThat means what you have now, you worked for. You don\u2019t owe your siblings anything put compassion for what they\u2019ve gone through and even then, your parents abused you too. Being put on a pedestal and having been pitted against your siblings from birth should be considered a form of emotional abuse since it destroyed your chance at a healthy upbringing with them.\n\nTell them if they want restitution that badly they need to sue your parents, if they\u2019re still around. It\u2019s not up to you to make up for their shitty childhood.", "NTA and they are the ones like your parents, not you. You left home 18 and didn't have any help. That's hard as hell but you worked hard and worked on yourself. I'm sorry for what they went through, but it wasn't your fault.\n\nThe only way you *might* owe them anything is if your parents died and left you everything and you had an inheritance to share. But restitution is for criminals and you're not one. They need to go try and judge their parents.", "NTA but it sounds like they'd benefit from therapy themselves. Not your kids. Not your fault. Not your problem.", "NTA, most messaging and social networking sites offer a free service called blocking. It's really useful when family are being entitled jerks and you can make it clear how you feel. Don't let them make you feel bad. They're just bitter.", "NTA. It's sucks you had bad parents, but it's not your fault they aren't doing so well. You don't owe them anything.", "NTA but I'm curious, if you could put yourself in their shoes, what would you say was the justification for getting a stipend from their older sibling?  It seems like such an odd request.", "I think this is hilarious. What a novel way to be a beggar and still try to sounds righteous and deserving. Please take it for the absolute joke it is and cut contact with these people. NTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s sad they didn\u2019t overcome their shit childhood, but you\u2019re not at all obligated to give them your money.", "INFO: Did your parents provide you with money for college/training before you blocked them at 18?", "NTA\n\nI am sorry your parents were so awful to your siblings but you don't owe them anything. You were also a child and one with enough awareness of how messed up the situation was that you got yourself out of it as soon as you were able to.  From your comments, you did not have a financial leg-up (that you took) so all your success is from your work not your parents.", "NTA.  Your siblings have a lot of noive.  (Brooklyn accent intentional).  Seeking \"restitution\" from you because you \"benefited\" from the bad parenting?  No.  Just ... no. \n\nI could see coming to you for advice about making it in the world, recommendations for good schools, etc.  That's all pretty standard older sibling stuff.  But ... \"restitution?\"  What.  The.  Hell.  That has so much chutzpah that chutzpah is saying, \"Get a load of those people.\"\n\nBlock 'em and send 'em on your way.  \n\nBTW -- I saw below that your parents set aside money for college that you haven't touched.  If they had come seeking help, generally, then I'd say you should try to talk your parents into releasing that money for them. \n\nBut if your siblings press the level labeled \"emotional blackmail,\" then to heck with them.", "NTA. This request is utterly ridiculous. They have no leg to stand on legally. They'd be laughed out of court. They only want your hard-earned money. Yeah, it sucks when your parents play favorites, but you walked away from all that. You aren't to blame for what they put your siblings through. Do not feel guilty for making a good life for yourself.", "This is wild. Does that mean I get to sue my family for having a bad childhood?\n\nNTA, tell them to hit the road.", "NTA - you where also a child, you did not have control over the situation and as hard of a pill it is to swallow you are not responsible for your siblings lives, nor do you owe them anything.", "NTA. You did not get any benefit from being the Golden Child that can be compensated monetarily. You supported yourself. Left at 18. It is up to them to carve out their own pathways without looking for a handout from you. You don't owe them a penny.", "NTA", "NTA", "They need to take their anger out on your parents. You may have received extra help as a minor but key word there is minor. Their actions aren\u2019t on you.\n\nCurious though what they feel like a decent restitution amount would be and where they even got the idea.", "NTA. You are not responsible for your siblings' upbringing. You got out and went no contact as soon as you could, got therapy and worked hard.\n\nWe can blame our parents for a lot, but at some point, we have to pull up our big kid pants and take responsibility for our adulthood, like you did. \n\nYou owe them nothing.", "NTA. The audacity! Block them. You don't need these ungrateful brats in your life.", "NTA. You cannot help how your parents behaved and you are not liable for it. If anyone owes them anything it\u2019s your parents, who you went no contact with as soon as you possibly could. You seem like someone who\u2019d have gone out of their way to do a favor or help them get a leg up if they\u2019d asked for something reasonable and wanted to build a sibling relationship; sad that they\u2019ve thrown that away.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They need to make their own way.", "Nta", "NTA. You had no control over what your parents did.", "NTA.  I'm sorry they were treated like that, but that is an absolutely absurd demand.", "NTA. Tell them to ask the parents for your college fund if they\u2019re so desperate for cash and you don\u2019t intend to use it.", "NTA. So they were 12 and 13 when you were 18 and left the house and cut contact with your parents. Maybe their reasoning is that you had an advantage while you were in high school and still dependent on your parents while they didn't get the same support after you left, and they got into high school but never got the same support. Maybe they don't know you rejected their money when you left for college and took loans instead. Regardless, you don't owe them \"restitutions\" because of your parents. They won't believe you anyway even if you provide proof. Best to block them and move on with your life.", "NTA.  They are.  They also don't know what restitution means.  If they want restitution it needs to come from the people that wronged them, your parents.  I assume they're not because you're better off than your parents.", "Yes, I didn't accept any money from them for college. I took out loans and worked when I wasn't in school to pay for it", "I can understand them not seeing me in the best light because of how we were all treated but I can't figure out a reason to pay them to make up for it. If they had just asked me if they needed help, I would have been more than willing to help them.", "They did have a college fund for me but it's still sitting in the bank. I refuse to touch it because I want nothing to do with them. They did have a ton of strings attached to it as well and I wasn't willing to deal with them anymore", "Hit the road\n\nJack \n\nand don't come back\n\nno more\n\nno more\n\n#no more", ">Does that mean I get to sue my family for having a bad childhood?\n\nRight? Wonder if my Evil Ex-Stepfather is still around?", "Then you\u2019re in the clear. Even if you had advantages while applying for college / loans because of things your parents provided you with earlier, that\u2019s not your fault. You made the choice to end the favouritism by force as soon as you were a legal adult. You can\u2019t control what your upbringing was like before then.\n\nI would just ignore them in all honesty. If they get more aggressive, ask them why you feel you have to repay your siblings for your parents being assholes. Wait for them to give a good answer. They won\u2019t be able to come up with one. It\u2019s understandable they\u2019re angry about their treatment growing up, but they have no reason to take it out on you.\n\nYou should be proud of your success.\n\nMight be wise to distance the relationship a bit if they keep harassing you, it\u2019s not healthy for anyone involved.\n\nGood luck!", "I would definitely be turned off by the word \"restitution.\" You did not commit a crime against them. That is pretty entitled.", "Wow that's dedication and much props to you for that. Plenty of folks would have taken the money, but I'm with you, I wouldn't have taken it.", "Are you the only one of the siblings with a college fund?", "Believe me, the money would have been. nice. I wouldn't have been in so much debt but it wasn't worth it", "Sometimes free money comes with too great a price tag.", "From what I've heard, yes, I was the only one but I couldn't give the money to any of them as it's fully controlled by our parents", "Does it matter if they didn\u2019t use it? They didn\u2019t profit from it.", "I get it, it's just normally people come here asking if they were the asshole for taking money from folks they don't like or whatever.\n\nTheir response was just oddly refreshing.", "Only because it could be a source of friction with the siblings regardless.", "True, and honestly I was curious too."]}
