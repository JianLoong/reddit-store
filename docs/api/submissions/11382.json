I tried to explain that he doesn\u2019t leave me an opening for myself if he\u2019s up all night gaming, napping in the mornings, and leaving chores to be done during the day, so I am starting to resent you for playing games.

He said I should just ask for free time and I have no right to resent him. I lost my shit and yelled F*** handed him both the kids, got my keys and drove off. I spent two hours at a McD\u2019s killing time and I came home to all three of them sleeping.\n\nNow it\u2019s the next day and no one has mentioned last night. Once again, I am bf, he is napping, and there is no food cooked, the dogs, haven\u2019t gone out yet, and the house is messy. Is he right that THIS is when I\u2019m supposed to ask?

You're basically a feeder trough to two hungry babies. You are clearly communicating your issues, but your husband isn't listening. I would bet money that pretty soon he's going to call it \"nagging\". Is there any way you could take the babies and stay at a friend or family members house for a few weeks? If not that, are you able to pump and freeze any so that you can have some time to yourself and he can feed them?\n\nAlso, there is no shame in formula.

He should be doing all the housework, pet care, etc in what he's considering his downtime which is not really downtime, is it? My DIL had twins and because they were in the hospital for so long she ended up pumping and using bottles. It worked out later because two at once is constant feeding and everyone could help, it was an unexpected bonus.

Hand the list to your husband & tell him that that\u2019s his job description while he\u2019s on paternity leave along with baby care as needed. \n\nYou should be furious.

The whole thing sounds exhausting. I'd apologize for losing my shit but not for expecting him to do a better job, nor for needing bit of time away. And honestly, I'd be annoyed if I was taking care of babies and trying to sleep at night and someone was gaming next to me. Maybe you could talk about some ground rules and expectations? \n\nI think there are also milk extractors so he could bottle feed the babies with breast milk sometimes?

I've found I needed to give up gaming almost completely until around 5. I had to cook clean help with everything in between. My wife wasn't a gamer and didn't really understand the loss of it. However my parental duties came first so I made sure she never had to feel like she needed to run away for hours. You will get stressed out like this over and over.

He said he's getting bored because he doesn't have enough responsibilities to fill the day???  If he can tell you to ask for a break, then he already knows you need one.  You let him know that it's his job is to support the family right now, which includes you, not just the kids   He needs to learn some empathy and take some time to understand what you're going through and provide you with the help you need, not just split the household chores.  What a dope.", "NTA: Do you get to sleep when you're tired? Not if the babies need you. The first few years of a child's life the parents get no sleep.

I'm sure he's having such a hard time parenting as well. /s\n\nCan you ask family members or friends to come clean and help out?

If you are up nursing if he isn't helping you he should be sleeping in the night so you can nap whenever possible in the day.  Honestly with that amount of nursing I agree with you 100% he should be doing pretty much everything else, it won't be forever but till the cluster feeding stops.  I had one cluster feeding and I was losing my shit it's the worst I can't imagine two.

The type of stimulus from pumping is different than that from a child suckling. The pump isn\u2019t as efficient and a one for one exchange of a pumping session instead of feeding could still lower my supply.

As someone who had lots of trouble starting to breastfeed my first kid (no colostrum and my milk took 3 days to appear) breast pumping was the way to increase my milk supply.

The IBLCE breaks down all the ways you can successfully pump, but also explains that a child will always be more efficient. If the child has a good latch, offer them the breast before resorting to pumping. If you have no colostrum, your child will get frustrated in the breast and might not latch/suckle enough to build supply, so you were an awesome mom and pumped for them. My boys do latch and are already establishing my supply. I need to feed two mouths instead of one. I didn\u2019t want to risk swapping to pumping because of the huge demand that is, and with the right support I shouldn\u2019t have to (in theory).

I\u2019m not sure what pumps you have but those settings are most likely to first stimulate until your milk lets down, and once you have a flow going you would swap to the constant pressure. The general idea is that even the best pump in the market can get pretty close to how efficient a child is, but will not be as efficient.", "Is this a new rule?  I breastfed all my children and giving them water in a bottle was my doctor's suggestion for introducing the bottle.  It also depends on the child.  One child I was babysitting had a very strong urge to suck.  Would spit out a pacifier and be mad.  We gave her a bottle of water then a bottle of formula, per Doctor's instruction.", "You really need more support, your husband is not doing enough. With my first one I had to resort to bottles for one feeding because it was the only way I could sleep 3h per day, I would be with her all the time.

I also know that breastfeeding takes a lot of calories and one of your comments you mentioned having a struggle to even have time to eat, something super needed. \n\nSo what I just want to say is don't demand so much of yourself, if breastfeeding is taking a big emotional tool on you, it's okay to choose not to. And if you're not comfortable with pumps or formula, it's also okay, just don't let it affect what you feel as a mother, because everyone here can see you're doing a great job. \n\nAnd I've heard that from twins a woman's body can take longer from the usual 6 weeks that doctors talk of bleeding and others studies talk about more than a year for hormones going back to normal, so it may be worth mentioning it to your husband as you're not only being a parent for 2 with no time to decompress, but also recovering from a huge medical procedure!", "Ah yeah, for miniature dairy goats.
