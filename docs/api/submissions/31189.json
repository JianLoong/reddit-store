{"id": 31189, "submission_id": "17xw5i8", "title": "UPDATE - AITA for refusing to smile at someone who told me I should smile more?", "selftext": "Update for a post I made here a couple of days ago: I know everyone says this on their update posts, but wow - I did NOT expect to get so many responses to my original post. Thank you to everyone who took the time to hear me out and share your opinions and experiences! I know the \"you should smile more\" thing for women isn't new, but reading all of your comments about your experiences with similar remarks really hammered it home for me. This wasn't okay, and I don't have to put up with those comments from my family.\r  \nThe day after I made the original post, I decided to call my mom and talk to her about the situation. A lot of you said that what she and my brother were doing was essentially bullying, and I hadn't thought about it that way, but you're absolutely right. When I told her about how much her comments annoyed and hurt me, she was surprised at first. She told me that she had no idea that the comments bothered me that much and that she hadn't thought about how misogynistic they were. She told me that she's received comments like \"you should smile more\" from creepy men for years and that she just treated it as part of life. The fact that she just dealt with it for years made me kind of sad, and while it doesn't excuse her comments, it does kind of help me understand why she didn't see a problem with them. She apologized to me and told me that she would stop, and I'm willing to believe her this time.\r  \nAlso, I'm going home for Thanksgiving next week, and I'm going to see most of the other people who have been making these comments to me. Your comments have given me the courage to stand up for myself, and I plan to put a stop to those comments. If they continue to give me a hard time for it, I'll just send them the link to the original post so they can see that hundreds of people on here are nicer to me than they are. <3\r  \nTo the people who suggested that I contact the manager/supervisor/corporate for the store: I wanted to let you know that I did just that. I hadn't thought about it before, and I did that earlier today. As it turns out, Bill was actually let go from his position about a month ago - apparently I wasn't the only person he made these kinds of comments to. Even though I played no part in that decision, it felt like an appropriate conclusion to the situation, and I figured you deserved to know.\r  \nThank you so much for all of your kind words in your comments and messages! I haven't had time to respond to all of your comments, but I promise I've read every single one, and they definitely made me smile for a good reason. You've renewed my faith in humanity, and I feel like I just gained a few hundred new friends! I hope you all have an amazing day! <3\r  \n[Original post linked here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17tvhbp/aita_for_refusing_to_smile_at_someone_who_told_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)", "created_utc": 1700274503, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17xw5i8/update_aita_for_refusing_to_smile_at_someone_who/", "score": 160, "replies": ["Oh thank god he got fired.", "I'm so glad things worked out well for you, especially that your mother realized that what she was doing was hurting you and apologized.\n\nAs far as Bill getting fired - that is about the best ending to this that could happen.
