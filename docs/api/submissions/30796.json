Living at home as an adult sure doesn't give your parents the *right* to touch you however they please. But that constant opportunity is not helping.

You have the right to say who can and cannot touch any part of your body at any time.  Family doesn't have special rights to your body.  The fact that you told him it hurt and he still ignored you, even mocked you, just makes this even worse.  I'd even say abusive.", "NTA that\u2019s really odd behaviour\u2026. Really really odd.

However, there might be a price tag. You have to be ready to accept that as a possibility.

I don't condone or understand the idea that family actually gets a pass to treat you worse than a stranger can or would.
