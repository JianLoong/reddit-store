His friends were going to celebrate Super Bowl and his birthday at his friend Johnny\u2019s house. Usually when he\u2019s having these boys nights, he brings our kids along so I can have a few hours by myself. Yesterday I needed to go buy valentine\u2019s card for our preschooler\u2019s party at school, he also needed snow boots, and formula for our baby\n\nMy husband and I agreed that since it was snowing so much, it would be safer if he came and pick up the kids instead of me dropping the kids off to him at Johnny\u2019s house. On his way home, he called me and said if he pick up the kids then he won\u2019t be able to really hang out with his friends. So I said, it\u2019s fine. He can just go and he doesn\u2019t have to pick up the kids. But just make sure he makes time to go buy formula for our baby.\n\nAnd then he got really upset. He started saying \u201cWhat is wrong with you\u201d, \u201cwhy are you being like that\u201d, \u201cdo you really want to argue\u201d, \u201cfuck you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m so sick and tired of this\u201d. I was confused and said I was trying to make things easier. He can go to his birthday and he doesn\u2019t have to pick up the kids, they can stay home with me since it\u2019s snowing more than expected. Then he starts to yell at me to shut up because he\u2019s already on his way to pick up the kids.\n\nOnce he got home, he\u2019s started kicking the door and stuffs around. He called Johnny and said he\u2019s not coming anymore. My husband obviously sound really upset. His friend constantly asks why is he not going and that what is the real reason he\u2019s not going, what\u2019s going on, and does my husband needs to talk to someone, then asks if my husband wants to talk to his other friend\u2019s SIL (idk who this SIL is). Then his friends started messaging him to go. Johnny texted him basically saying that I was problem. His other friend messaged him and just said \u201cno wonder you couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d Which I\u2019m not sure what he is implying.\n\nSo yeah, all his friends are upset that I made my husband missed his own birthday party from them.", "created_utc": 1676316088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hgvr/aita_for_making_my_husband_missed_his_birthday/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It wasn\u2019t until THIS year 2023, where we agreed on this change. Which HE said HE is only comfortable with me having times for myself IF he is out with his boys and will bring the kids with him.\n\nHe didn\u2019t ask. He let me know a few days ago that he is going and HE wants to bring the kids. I didn\u2019t force him to bring them. I didn\u2019t beg him to bring them. And then he changed his mind, and I was okay with it. I wanted him to have fun either way.\n\nYes, it was actually really important to get formula considering we have about 10 scoops left. Which equals to 5 4oz bottles. Considering our 11 months old eats approximately 4 bottles at night. He didn\u2019t want to go but he didn\u2019t let me go get it too. So what did I have to do, I had to mix it with whole milk praying that our 11yo WON\u2019T get constipated. \n\nHe works today at 6 AM so should he stayed and get drunk until 4AM and go to work at 6 AM? But he didn\u2019t plan on staying late and I didn\u2019t thing it was going to be problem for him to drive to Target (5 minutes away from Johnny\u2019s house) after he was done considering Target doesn\u2019t even close until 10 and they\u2019re starting the boy\u2019s night at 2PM. I was going to go get it when he come and pick up the kids. He does know that we need to get formula. When he got home, he then won\u2019t let me leave to get the formula neither let me take all the kids and go.\n\nYes it was snowing all day yesterday and a lot. So much that schools are closed today.\n\nAnd again, he wanted to bring the kids and changed his mind and I was okay with it. I didn\u2019t guilt him anything. Just needed formula. He won\u2019t go and he won\u2019t let me go so what? I didn\u2019t even ask him to go find snow boots and valentines cards.", "Sounds like OPs husband is more controlling than he is a good man.", "For the last 6 years of our marriage, he\u2019s been having boys nights with NO kids every months. I\u2019m always home with the kids. I don\u2019t have girls night. I\u2019m not allowed to go anywhere without my husband and kids. It\u2019s only this year where we changed this because he\u2019s only okay with my having times for myself IF he\u2019s with his friends. So\u2026", "I wasn\u2019t waiting for last minute. He was at his brother\u2019s house from 9AM-1:30PM. We talked and he said he wants to bring the kids to Johnny\u2019s and so I can go get the stuffs our kids need.", "That still doesn\u2019t explain the situation-specific detail excluded here, it just shows you don\u2019t like them", "When was the last time he had a night out with friends without the kids?", "Why? Do you not have friends?", "OP, your hubby sounds like he's successfully kept you isolated for the last 6 years, if that's the case??? Thats part of abuse. And flipping out to keep you on eggshells and guessing at what you did wrong is too.  You need to talk to somebody professional about this.", "And there it is; he's punishing you for daring to want time to yourself, and telling his friends you're the controlling asshole.\n\nNTA. Your kids are going to learn how to be adults from this man. Really think about that, okay?", "> He told me to stop or else he\u2019s going break start breaking stuffs\n\nI just want you to know that this is not a normal reaction to being upset. Violence against belongings/inanimate objects is still violence and can still be really traumatizing (for you and for your kids). \n\nI didn't realize I was in an abusive relationship until I tried to get out. It doesn't always look like what you'd think. Please be safe. You deserve better.\n\n[Resources for Unhealthy Relationships](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/resources/relationships/)", "Wow, it sounds like he's really on edge emotionally. Stress from a sleep-deprived baby household?", "That was a conversation for his friends. To make you the \"nagging wife\". Which makes it easier to do shitty things like, stay out late or cheat. His friends will cover for him because you're \"no fun\" and \"never let him do anything\".", "Oh Shoot I see now.   Okay I'm being serious right now.   \n\nI think someone was listening and I didn't matter what you said, he was making a show. \n\nTalk to his friends face to face.", "He is trying to describe you as the bad guy in fron of his friends. The moment when my husband say \"fuck you\" to me, will be the moment when I'll be contacting a divorce lawyer.", "Is he hiding something?", "Everyone says you're leaving out information because you were either leaving out info on purpose or because you don't know the info. \n\nMaybe I should explain why I think it's sus? You never mentioned this was a biweekly thing or that his friends, as far as you know, are single and shouldn't have a SIL. The fact that without any of that info, but mentioning the SIL, kind of implies you think something fishy is going on. Because you didn't mention the biweekly game you also didn't mention that the kids normally stay with you. \n\nLook I don't know your reasons to trickle out information like this. As an outside observer it feels like you're either making up a story as you go or you think your husband is cheating and you want an outside opinion.\n\nIf this is true than I give u/EnvironmentalEgg512 some credit. I still stand by my reply to them knowing what we knew at the time. Only you know if he normally acts like an asshole. Regardless if he's an abusive asshole or this is out of pocket for him, you probably have some suspicions of him cheating. Which, based on what you put, I would also think that. The next steps, only you can decide. We still don't know much about your dynamic. If he's an abusive asshole, leave him regardless of cheating. If he's normally not like that, have a discussion. Based on how that goes, you have to make a choice to stay or go. I'm torn on the snooping on phones and stuff, because on one hand it's really the only way to know for sure if they won't let you see. The other hand though, if you're already that distrustful why would you want the relationship to continue?\n\nI can't speak for everyone, but when I ask for info I'm not calling you a liar. I'm saying something doesn't add up or it's so vague it could go either way.", "It's interesting you can make that leap after reading the above. Could he be an abusive asshole? Sure. Just as equally he just had a shitty couple days. She didn't mention him booting things across the room just that he kicked things. There's a wide range of power that can be used for a kick. \n\nI have a feeling you are either projecting your childhood/relationship (s) or you're sheltered enough to go immediately to an extreme. I agree he didn't handle it well. All I'm saying is there is a lot OP didn't say. Much of which you are assuming to immediately paint him in the worst way.\n\nEdit: Which is why I put INFO in my first response. OOP has no obligation to answer it, but with what was given there are many many pathways that can be thought up to make one or the other as the bad person.\n\nEdit 2: gotta love people emotionally down voting without knowing the context that the OP hadn't revealed any of the missing info prior to my first and second replies. Info that actually gave us a better understanding of their dynamic without jumping to conclusions.", "Nome of that explains his reaction unless you were saying it passive aggressively, or he has anger issues you\u2019re not sharing. Basically, I can\u2019t render a judgment because something is missing.", "I agree, but I still think something is missing.", "How does he prevent you from going? \nI honestly don\u2019t think you are leaving anything out except the fact that he\u2019s controlling and him only allowing you time alone is if you are at home. There\u2019s something not right. \nHe\u2019s controlling, and it really sounds like he was planning on staying later and drinking, which is his issue, but why couldn\u2019t he pick up formula and drop it off beforehand? \nI\u2019m thinking your husband is talking trash about you. It doesn\u2019t matter if you prefer he not stay out and drink with his single friends. Your his wife . You have a right to express that. \nIt doesn\u2019t mean he has to listen but it doesn\u2019t give him a right to talk crap about you to all of them so he can feel justified in treating you like a prisoner. Plus the \u201cSIL\u201d thing. Really sketchy.  Even if you constantly nag him, I\u2019m not saying you do, what I\u2019m saying is, it doesn\u2019t give him the right to be verbally abusive and throw a tantrum or prevent you from taking care of the baby.  That\u2019s abuse. \nThat\u2019s his child as well.  That\u2019s child neglect", "I don\u2019t dislike them. Just stating that they don\u2019t like me. But yes, I don\u2019t like them then when they encourage my husband to keep drinking knowing our kids are with him.", "Last week.", "This is what I\u2019m thinking. I bet this has happened before.  I wonder if he went along with you wanting to do things differently this year for just enough times and now he\u2019s done. I guarantee he is hiding something. He\u2019s anger is coming from he doesn\u2019t want to be the bad guy and feel guilty about whatever it is. \nUnder no circumstances should a husband be talking to another woman who isn\u2019t his relative or yours about your relationship.  \nYou might want to start protecting yourself and the kids. Put some money back somewhere.", "This. I would stick to texts OP. \n\nAnd check with a family counsellor, either you left out something or he\u2019s manipulative/abusive. Either way things are not healthy. \n\nI did have an ex many years ago who tried calling me to stay out later on boys nights, as if for permission (or I\u2019d nag). I\u2019d talk to his friends, say hi, hear what they\u2019re up to. Then say have fun, and make my own plans (or we end up all meeting up later). I told them every time I couldn\u2019t care less how late they stay, when they\u2019d ask me. I never knew why dude kept calling me, this happened every time. I don\u2019t get why there are guys who like to act like their partner is nagging when they\u2019re not, but it happens. \n\nI get overbearing partners exist too, if OP is keeping that out then it still needs someone else to talk it out with OP.", "I wasn\u2019t saying it in any passive aggressive way. Him taking the kids or not is not a big deal. I just wanted him to have fun either way. I\u2019m not looking into getting more votes.", "And before that?"]}
