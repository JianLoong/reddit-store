His friends were going to celebrate Super Bowl and his birthday at his friend Johnny\u2019s house. Usually when he\u2019s having these boys nights, he brings our kids along so I can have a few hours by myself. Yesterday I needed to go buy valentine\u2019s card for our preschooler\u2019s party at school, he also needed snow boots, and formula for our baby\n\nMy husband and I agreed that since it was snowing so much, it would be safer if he came and pick up the kids instead of me dropping the kids off to him at Johnny\u2019s house. On his way home, he called me and said if he pick up the kids then he won\u2019t be able to really hang out with his friends. So I said, it\u2019s fine. He can just go and he doesn\u2019t have to pick up the kids. But just make sure he makes time to go buy formula for our baby.\n\nAnd then he got really upset. He started saying \u201cWhat is wrong with you\u201d, \u201cwhy are you being like that\u201d, \u201cdo you really want to argue\u201d, \u201cfuck you\u201d, \u201cI\u2019m so sick and tired of this\u201d. I was confused and said I was trying to make things easier. He can go to his birthday and he doesn\u2019t have to pick up the kids, they can stay home with me since it\u2019s snowing more than expected. Then he starts to yell at me to shut up because he\u2019s already on his way to pick up the kids.\n\nOnce he got home, he\u2019s started kicking the door and stuffs around. He called Johnny and said he\u2019s not coming anymore. My husband obviously sound really upset. His friend constantly asks why is he not going and that what is the real reason he\u2019s not going, what\u2019s going on, and does my husband needs to talk to someone, then asks if my husband wants to talk to his other friend\u2019s SIL (idk who this SIL is). Then his friends started messaging him to go. Johnny texted him basically saying that I was problem. His other friend messaged him and just said \u201cno wonder you couldn\u2019t make it.\u201d Which I\u2019m not sure what he is implying.\n\nSo yeah, all his friends are upset that I made my husband missed his own birthday party from them.\n\nEdit: first, I just want to say that I did not force my husband to bring the kids. I did not ask him nor did I beg him. HE wanted to. And then he changed his mind. And I was okay. Why am I not allowed to be okay with him not bringing the kids?\n\nSecondly, we agreed this year 2023 that he will bring the kids with him to his friends house so I can have me time. The past years, sometimes he takes one or 2 of our kids kids with him but there was never a time where I was kids free. It\u2019s been only almost 7 weeks. He\u2019s only brought the kids with him 2 times since  this year started.", "created_utc": 1676316088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111hgvr/aita_for_making_my_husband_missed_his_birthday/", "score": 560, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He let me know a few days ago that he is going and HE wants to bring the kids. I didn\u2019t force him to bring them. I didn\u2019t beg him to bring them. And then he changed his mind, and I was okay with it. I wanted him to have fun either way.\n\nYes, it was actually really important to get formula considering we have about 10 scoops left. Which equals to 5 4oz bottles. Considering our 11 months old eats approximately 4 bottles at night. He didn\u2019t want to go but he didn\u2019t let me go get it too.

The next steps, only you can decide. We still don't know much about your dynamic. If he's an abusive asshole, leave him regardless of cheating. If he's normally not like that, have a discussion.

In this case, your husband doesn't know every detail about what's going on and so can't make good decisions and resents being asked to make those decisions anyway. \n\nFor example:\n\"Should I buy more crackers?\"\n\n\"I don't know. Do we need crackers?\"\n\n\"Well, we're out.\"\n\n\"Then why are you asking me?

You don't need to buy them.\"\n\n\"Ok so you don't want me to buy crackers?\"\n\nEtc\n\nIf this sort of thing is a regular dynamic, then everyone ends up exhausted having dumb conversations about crackers. In which case, stop asking permission to go grocery shopping and just go get the groceries!\n\nWay two: the second way I can interpret your comments is that your husband is super-controlling and abusive to an extreme degree. \n\nIn which case, get out now, go somewhere safe, get a divorce, sue for child support, make sure his time with the kids is extremely limited, and enjoy going to the grocery store and getting food whenever you feel like it.\n\nGood luck.", "There are a lot more good men than women who tell the whole story.

I\u2019m still not sure what I want to be when I grow up\u2026 been figuring that out since they asked that in elementary school! I\u2019ve known people 60+ who are still trying to figure that out!", "I wouldn\u2019t say I think she\u2019s being unreasonable or petty. I would say I think she\u2019s been suppressing her feelings about his shitty behavior their whole marriage and likely being passive aggressive about it. I think that\u2019s immature. And I think he\u2019s an abusive asshole that she should\u2019ve never married in the first place and should divorce now. I think I came across the way I did because her post is about being confused by his behavior but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s honestly confused. She *knows* she\u2019s married to a giant asshole.", ">Edit: first, I just want to say that I did not force my husband to bring the kids. I did not ask him nor did I beg him. HE wanted to. And then he changed his mind. And I was okay. Why am I not allowed to be okay with him not bringing the kids?\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound forced to me."]}
