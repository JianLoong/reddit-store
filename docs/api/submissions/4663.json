He was 6 months old and had been orphaned which was the reason for his placement into the system. My SIL and her husband were given some letters and other possessions that his biological mother had saved for him, when she realized she was going to pass and my SIL and her husband destroyed them, and planned for my nephew to never have any contact with his biological family.\n\nMy nephew was always curious about his biological family ever since he learned he was adopted at the age of 11, when one of his cousins told him. He asked many questions. SIL and her husband always lied and told him they knew nothing about his biological parents. They claimed no info was ever passed to them. My husband told him the truth when he asked two years ago (he was 18 at the time). It hurt him that his parents had done that and it made him want to explore his biological family even more.\n\nHe found an aunt and two uncle's, his mother's younger siblings, who were minors at the time of his parents passing. SIL and her husband tried to forbid him from searching, they told him THEY are his parents and he doesn't need to go digging around for strangers who are nothing more than history. It upset  him because he loves his parents, but he feels let down by them.\n\nHe went ahead to meet his biological family anyway and learned that his biological mother was diagnosed with cancer weeks after he was born, and when he was 3 months old his biological father died. She was alone with him when she got the terminal diagnosis. His biological father was a foster kid and his biological mother's parents did not want to raise him, and had not liked his biological father. Apparently his aunt and uncle's were heartbroken to lose their BIL who they had known as kids, then they lost their sister and then their nephew, the last piece of their sister.\n\nNephew moved in with my husband and I a few months ago when he struggled with the cost of college, work and rent but due to arguments over his forming a relationship with his biological family, didn't feel comfortable living with SIL and her husband.\n\nShe has been making comments toward me about keeping her son from her and how can everyone just expect her to be okay with being stabbed in the back. The last time she showed up at MILs house and started yelling at me about it and I told her she had no business becoming a parent through adoption because she could not accept that she was only his mother because of two huge losses, and a set of tragic circumstances, and she should want him to follow his heart, that she should be able to understand he can love more than her and her husband.

That is horrifying. Your poor nephew. We kept every single scrap from our children\u2019s lives prior to adoption. Anything we had from families of origin, the clothes they came to us wearing, every single thing. So much history is erased (or at the very least unshared) by default in adoption.

I have a family, they would not be family to be at all.\n\nBut.

That is a whole new level of cruel. \n\nBefore adopting him should have processed whether they could properly handle their son wanting to know where he came from and who his bio family were. To try take that away from him? Now *that* is insensitive. They should have never denied their son the truth or his bio family, and they should have never burdened their son with their unresolved emotions by guilting this poor kid. \n\nThis was a journey he needed to take.
