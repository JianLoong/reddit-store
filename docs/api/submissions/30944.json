I don't think it's a bad thing to teach her a lesson, but I think such a low stakes issue isn't the right situation to make that stand. I think that, instead of reinforcing things, since it isn't actually a big deal, she'd instead resent you for punishing her over something so simplistic. But absolutely have a conversation with her; maybe even show her the post (you know her, so you'll know better than anyone if that would be a productive idea or not) . There's no reason that forging your signature (if that happens) isn't worthy of a conversation about responsibility and obligations.", "I'm not sure if it's guidance, but I've been reminding her of taking notes and adding events to her calendar", "Yes, I've been on it for a few years. Especially with the calendar.", "I mean, that's definitely a start and I'm glad you're doing that for her. I would recommend having an open conversation with her and ask her if those particular strategies aren't working for her, and if so, whether she can pinpoint *why* they aren't working for her so you can brainstorm other systems that might work for her together. Maybe she needs alarms set to remind her to check her notes or calendar? Maybe she would benefit from a paper calendar that sits right on her desk instead of a calendar on her phone or vice versa? Sometimes the strategies that work for one person just don't for another which may be making things more difficult for her. \n\nYou guys can work through this! Just remember - you're on the same team and working together is the only way.", "Will probably get downvoted but, to give some perspective, when I was in school my parents trusted me and I forged their signature frequently for small things where a signature was needed. I always told them in advance before getting their verbal agreement to forge and never used it for nefarious things. I think they didn't care because it was just unnecessary hassle saved. \n\nSo I am of the opinion that forging a signature (even if it's illegal) isn't the biggest evil of all time.", "YTA\n\nYou are actively planning for your child to make a mistake and then as a result, do something against your wishes.  \n\nIf you can see it coming, rather than planning a punishment in advance, help her better organizer her schedule \n\nThere is a lot more value in getting someone into a habit of doing things properly with guidance than punishing them and expecting them to learn from it in the future.", "Can't really weigh in here.

You know she might forget, just be like, hey honey do you have that permission slip? No? Ok let\u2019s print one. \nWhy are you playing games like that? Waiting for her to forge so you can punish? She\u2019s 16 and her frontal lobe isn\u2019t developed. You\u2019re the adult. Fucking act like it.", "YWBTA - I don't think this is a sensible line imo. It's very common, and actually entirely legal, to forge signatures (technically not even \"forging\") as long as you have permission. And you *are* going to give her permission to go. So its needless to force a distinction between giving her permission to go and giving her permission to sign it.\n\n Drawing an arbitrary boundary around the physical signing is liable to teach her completely the wrong lesson. She might just stop telling you about these things and continue forging anyway, because you're teaching her that the physical signature matters more than what the signature represents (being honest with you and asking permission - which she has done). It's entirely possible that in her eyes you will only have effectively punished her for telling the truth.", "I'm on the fence. On the one hand you said no, so she would expressly be going against your word if she does it, but on the other hand, my mom gave me full permission to forge her name on any school paperwork because she understands people forget things and only freak parents care about controlling what totally benign school things you participate in.\n\nYou know the form exist and are clearly wasting time just thinking about her not having you sign it. Just go talk to her and sign it.", "I think yta in the fact that you're setting her up for failure. She's still in high-school, you're still in the guiding stage of parenting. She asked, you said know. You have still remembered the form and your daughter probably had it slip her mind (especially seeing as you say she got your forgetfulness gene). Now is the time to remind her frequently and teach her the skills you have learned to remember certian important things the have a due date (post it notes, reminders on phones or on her binder, whatever). This isn't the time for a gotcha moment. Be thankful you have an honest daughter who asked you instead of just doing it. \n\nIf she had just done it without asking or telling you about it it would be a whole different story but she sounds like she's trying to be a good kid who needs someone to guide her instead of trip her up.", "YTA, your kid didn't fake a painting and sell it for money she forged your signature on a permission slip you would have signed anyway.

When Amy was in the 2nd grade, she had THE BEST teacher, we\u2019ll call her Ms. Jones. Ms. Jones was an a older lady but very energetic and so much fun. She raised several children of her own and had been an educator her entire life. This lady had seen it all and was no nonsense. We all loved her. \n\nAnyway, Amy didn\u2019t do well on a test and was supposed to bring it home for a signature. She never did show us and finally one day handed it in to her teacher with what was clearly her hard 2nd grade effort at my husbands signature. It was clearly fake. Ms. Jones sent me a picture and then asked if she could handle it the old school way. She explained it all to me. \n\nMs. Jones pulled Amy aside and asked if she wanted to tell her something about her test. Amy tried to lie and Ms. Jones walked her to the principals office where they both GENTLY explained to her that forgery was a serious crime. And that while they should call the authorities, it\u2019s more important that she consider how serious her offense was and did she want to start her young life as a criminal?  They talked to her for a short time. \n\nThat evening, Amy walked up to my husband and I and explained what she had done. She went on to say that a life of crime was not her goal and she wanted to live \u201con the right side\u201d of the law. She wrote my husband a note to apologize and said she\u2019d be willing to help walk the dogs and do poop patrol (we live in the city and have to walk our dogs and clean up after them, not complaining, just saying).
