The overwhelming majority made me believe that I would be the asshole and that this is a very preventable situation. I've decided to remind her to let me sign the form.

She took a picture of the slip and asked if she could just sign your name on it. This means she's probably done something like this before but didn't tell you because she didn't want to get in trouble. She likely asked this time because she genuinely thought she wouldn't get in trouble if she asked first. Let this be a very important lesson for her.", "You have been taking some criticisms and advice in a responsible and respectful way, so I don't think YTA--figuring out the line between discipline and grace is one of the great challenges of parenting. My parents kept me on a short leash, were preloaded for \"no,\" and loved to catch me failing. I was quite a troublemaker growing up, so they didn't seem to get their desired result. With my kids I have tried to  do the opposite.  I work very hard to try to say \"yes\" to any request I can, I trust my kids by default, and I try to always remind and forgive them easily. My youngest is 16, my oldest is 28, and I couldn't be more proud of all of them. They are fantastic and successful people, and I have a great relationship with all of them.  YMMV, and my approach probably wouldn't work with every kid, but I have never regretted skipping an opportunity to punish or criticize. Kids who are trusted to succeed may surprise you by excelling for their own benefit--and yours.", "I told my kids please just sign my name and let me know about it. I mean seriously.  They\u2019re not selling their kidneys.  They\u2019re taking a bus somewhere or it\u2019s a permission slip for some other school activity.

Just remind her.", "I mean my dad literally gave me permission to forge his signature for school things in high school cause he just didn't care.

You're the freaking adult here.  Personally if she doesn't bring you the permission slip, the day of the trip you call the teacher and tell her if your daughter presents a slip with your signature on it that it's not yours, you didn't sign it, and she should be left behind at the school for having tried to pull that bullshit.", "Stop being so passive with your kid, she's 16 just talk to her.", "Thank you for your thought on it. I think this is the way to go. Just wasn't sure if forging was a hard line.", "I don't disagree with you. However, I've been reminding her of things most of her life.

Guess that would definitely make me the asshole.", "No, I wouldn't ground her if she brought it to me before.", "It's more along the line of actions have consequences kinda lesson. I could see how that would be a bad idea in this instance", "Definitely! I just left her a reminder. Don't want to be an asshole", "Thank you. I'll look into an adhd test, too.", "I was thinking no phone for a week. Usually grounding in our house equates to loss of screen time.", "That seems to be the response here.

Not the hill to die on", "That was my thought too.

Thank you", "I forged my grandpa's signature on a permission slip. he drew the hard line and grounded me, and was SO upset. It worked. I wouldn't dream of forging anything ever again. Drawing that hard line teaches them that forgery is a serious problem, and people can get in so much trouble as adults for doing that.", "> Just wasn't sure if forging was a hard line.\n\nIt would be for me, but at this point that may still be preventable.", "I get that you want her to take more responsibility, but choosing not to remind someone of something when you know or heavily suspect that they have forgotten is a weird choice.", "She\u2019s,\n\na) still a child who needs to be reminded of things\n\nb) you\u2019re pre-punishing her for something you ASSUME she\u2019s going to do\n\nEdit to add: what is your goal here?

Cut them some slack man,", "\u201cI\u2019ve been reminding her of things her whole life\u201d you mean, the period of time in which she is a child whose brain is literally in the process of developing?? How shocking and completely unforeseeable that she isn\u2019t behaving like an adult. The thing she is not. Luckily she has a dad who recognizes this is a life skill she hasn\u2019t yet mastered and who can lay these fun traps for her to fall into. Because, of course, you wouldn\u2019t want to waste your time trying to give her the tools she needs to be successful. \n\nINFO: do you like your daughter and/or know what a child is?", "Yta", "You have to admit, it's a crappy thing to do. I get it, my children were absent minded at that age too but at least give her a chance and let her know the consequences if she tries it.", "Definitely YWBTA.   Like adults, including you and me, never need help remembering something?", "It definitely would. Just remind her and make her hand the slip to you right then.", "You're already beyond the point of being the asshole. You complain she has to act like a grown up; but why aren't you acting like one?", "Has she ever forged your signature before? \n\nEveryone needs a reminder once in a while, it's not even her age that has to do with it. I'd like for once not to have to remind my hubs of appointments, that he sets.", "That sounds pretty reasonable to me. A week might be a bit long but if you feel that this is a major misstep on her part then that's fair. As long as she can contact people she needs to in an emergency.\nGood luck. This will probably be a lesson in responsibility for her.", "Agreed. It's definitely preventable. I actually just left her a reminder to let me sign it", "Thanks. I agree.", "Part of b) is that he's also sabotaging by not reminding her when OP was perfectly capable and aware that they should. \n\nIs he ADHD by chance?  I bet she is.", "She's pretty responsible already. My focus was more on the forgery. I'm definitely seeing that it's easier to chat with her about it before hand", "Thanks for your response", "Agreed, good points. Thanks for your thoughts", "My daughter has my forgetting genes, as I used to do it all the time. Now, I set notes and reminders for myself. I'm hoping she develops that trait sooner rather than later", "That seems like the right thing to do. Thank you", "I'm not sure I agree with already being an asshole. But I'll talk with her and remind her about the form. Thanks", "No she hasn't. I hadn't even thought about that as a possibility until she sent me the picture and asked if she could sign it for me. I guess they grow up so quick. Agreed about reminders. I used to be really bad about forgetting things... Wonder where my daughter got it from", "Thanks for your thoughts on this.", "Forging a signature and lying about it would be a hard line for me\n\nTelling me about a trip and asking if they can sign it for convenience is not a hard line for me\n\n\n\n\nBut this makes me wonder why your daughter doesn\u2019t want you to sign it. She told you about the trip and sent you a picture so it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s trying to hide anything. \n\nMy parents always made us do extra chores before they signed anything for school. Didn\u2019t matter what it was. I absolutely hated it and would avoid it whenever I could. Could it be something like that?", "Agreed, I listened to the overwhelming majority of commenters and just reminded her. Honestly I'm not too sure about adhd. Definitely ocd and particular about things", "That\u2019s the right thing to do. Ahh teens, just think, only a few more years and she won\u2019t be a problem\u2026for you.", "Notes and reminders are great for remembering things. What are you doing to *help her* develop and implement those skills for herself so she can stop forgetting so much?", "Good time to start teaching her!   I use my Google calendar religiously for events, and add  reminders way ahead of them.", "At what age did you find success with managing your forgetfulness?", "Yeah you never think that with kiddos mines 5 and is too smart for his own good. \n\nMaybe teach her tricks to remind herself with phones now you can set them in calendar apps. (Doesn't work on my 40 yr old husband tho starting to think he just wants to hear my voice jk)", "It's all good. If you as a parent want to enforce certain rules that's fine. It's good to check to make sure it's a reasonable rule though. \n\nMy parents were ok with me signing for them when I was in high school but if that is something you're not comfortable with then that's ok. Different houses have different rules. \ud83d\ude42", "The reason I ask is that I am ADHD and it is very easy for something that isn't particularly important until it's actually needed to slip my mind. Procrastination is also another big thing with ADHD.\n\nOR\n\nShe could just be young and hasn't learned to be responsible yet.\n\nEither way, I'm glad you saw some sense. I don't think it's a bad thing to teach her a lesson, but I think such a low stakes issue isn't the right situation to make that stand. I think that, instead of reinforcing things, since it isn't actually a big deal, she'd instead resent you for punishing her over something so simplistic. But absolutely have a conversation with her; maybe even show her the post (you know her, so you'll know better than anyone if that would be a productive idea or not) . There's no reason that forging your signature (if that happens) isn't worthy of a conversation about responsibility and obligations.", "I'm not sure if it's guidance, but I've been reminding her of taking notes and adding events to her calendar", "Yes, I've been on it for a few years. Especially with the calendar.", "I mean, that's definitely a start and I'm glad you're doing that for her. I would recommend having an open conversation with her and ask her if those particular strategies aren't working for her, and if so, whether she can pinpoint *why* they aren't working for her so you can brainstorm other systems that might work for her together. Maybe she needs alarms set to remind her to check her notes or calendar? Maybe she would benefit from a paper calendar that sits right on her desk instead of a calendar on her phone or vice versa? Sometimes the strategies that work for one person just don't for another which may be making things more difficult for her. \n\nYou guys can work through this! Just remember - you're on the same team and working together is the only way."]}
