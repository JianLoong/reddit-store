Where does your dad sleep, how did you not know they were getting married if you live with your dad.", "ESH. This is your dad's decision - it was his home before it was your stepmother's. But if he decides along with his wife that the couple in the home (the people who pay for the home) deserve the ensuite, then you -as an adult living on their dime- need to switch rooms.", "NTA. I completely understand why she wants it, but if *your dad* has never sat you down and asked you to change rooms (also a reasonable ask) and there is a scheduled plan for the change to happen in 2024, then her continued harping on it is out of line. Your dad is being a coward for leaving it up to the two of you.", "People should have context here going through OP\u2019s replies. So to recap:\n\n- OP has the en-suite bedroom that is much bigger than the room her dad and his wife use\n- OP doesn\u2019t want to move rooms because she\u2019s \u201coverly attached to things\u201d\n- OP says the wife is \u201cotherwise an okay person\u201d\n- OP is 20 and doesn\u2019t pay any rent\n\nAlso keep in mind all of this about the evil stepmom is coming from OP\u2019s narrative which may or may not be reliable.

You made an agreement with your father you would move out in August 2024 and it sounds like he agreed to that. So that's the month you will be moving out. I wouldn't even discuss this with the wife further, she isn't your mother, she isn't the home owner, you were there first.", "NTA the request needs to come from your dad, as I assume he's the one who 'gave you' the room in the first place, and he's the one who owns the house. The way Dad went about this is bizarre and he's made his own bed for this conflict to happen.", "ESH,\n\nYour dad needs to control the situation better...but am I reading this right, that you don't pay rent, and occupy the master bedroom?  Your father, who provides everything for you, is sleeping in a secondary bedroom with his new wife, while paying for you to live in the primary bedroom?\n\nESH but HARD YTA...that's one of the most entitled things I've heard...it's his fault for enabling that kind of spoiled ass behavior, but the new wife is the only one thinking reasonably that two grown ass adults should have the bigger bedroom that HE pays for.\n\nNot only should you pay rent, you should, in a certain sense, pay MORE rent than him.  Being privileged with a free room while in school should be enough to sequester yourself to a different bedroom.", "You are 20, not paying rent, and refusing to give up the master bedroom in your dad and his wife's house until you leave for a study abroad trip in a year. \n\nHonestly yea YTA and your dad is a pretty shitty husband for letting this happen and not asking you to move into the smaller room so he and his wife can share the master bedroom in their house. \n\nYou should be more considerate of them especially when they are now married and you are living there rent free. If you want a master bedroom, pay for one in an apartment.", "NTA \n\nlock your door, bring the key with you when you go.

Two people staying in the smaller bedroom of the house they own is unfair. You would have a downgrade but it's still a free room.

From extra info it seems; Youre an ADULT and have been for a couple years now, yet you pay not rent. Why the hell should you have the bigger room with the ensuite rather than your dad and his partner? You shouldn't have even had to be asked.

I m very young rn but I don't expect my kids if I ever have any to pay me rent to live in their own house . If i decided to have them , they are my kids for all my life , not until they are 18 . They should always have something they can return to no matter how harsh life is towards them .  Nobody gets to remove my kid from a room they have been living for years while I do understand why your stepmom need a bigger room , it's your father's mess to sort out . You are moving out in a year then she can have that room right?", "Yes. She\u2019s very spoiled.", "I'm not paying rent. But my dad isn't forcing me to give up the bedroom.
