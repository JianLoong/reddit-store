And that room was *enormous* - it fit two large desks, a large bunkbed, a wardrobe, two dressers, a separate bookcase - and we used to set up the card table or the Christmas tree in there too! (I asked my sister about this recently and she said those were her happiest memories. This fits, she used to cajole me into sharing the top bunk with her most nights. My happiest thought about my own room is that it had a hook latch on the door and while I couldn't actually keep people out, being that I had the only access to the backyard, I could ensure they would think before walking in. We are clearly two very different people!) I think our neighbors upstairs illicitly subdivided their corresponding room, it was so big.\n\nOP's father might have had a perfectly good reason for dividing the rooms this way. If OP is moving out for definite at the end of this school year, I honestly wouldn't fight over it, not if I was the stepmother. It's just not worth it.

If Dad didn\u2019t tell OP he was getting married, chances are it\u2019s because he was too chicken to discuss the actual practical issues that would arise with that with OP or his wife. \n\nOP and her stepmom are acting similarly. Both are looking at the house as their home over which they have primary decision making without consideration for the fact that the other person might feel the same or why. OP is in her childhood home and has her personal history in that room on her side. Stepmom has been brought to this house as her marital home and under most circumstances would indeed have primary control over how the rooms are allocated alongside her husband (who has either agreed with OP or opted out of this conflict and is essentially hiding until it\u2019s over?) rather than their children. She has social norms and practicality (I.e. it\u2019s more logical to have two people sharing a space in the bigger space) on her side.\n\nWhen you consider logistics, OPs position is weak as her argument is basically \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d When you consider personal history, stepmom\u2019s position is weaker because her argument uses the common standards rather than viewing this as an *un*common situation. It\u2019s not an unreasonable request under most circumstances but this isn\u2019t really most circumstances.\n\nOP could recognize that she\u2019ll probably move out entirely in a couple of years and have her own place and household to set up exactly as she wishes and that she\u2019s would not be considered the woman of this house by most anyone but herself. If she moved into a house with her husband, for example, and his cousin didn\u2019t own the house but had been living in the master, it wouldn\u2019t be unreasonable for her to ask to switch. However, Stepmom  could recognize that OP will probably move out entirely in a couple of years and have her own place and household to set up exactly as she wishes so her demanding that she move out right now instead of in a couple of years is probably not worth the fight. Even if she \u201cwon\u201d the argument, she would get the room a little earlier but her stepdaughter will be pissed about this for the rest of their relationship and possibly (probably) consider it the most important aspect of their relationship, and grounds to not have a relationship at all with her. While that extreme might not happen with her husband, he\u2019ll probably also be pissed about it for at least a while. If it affects their relationship with his daughter long term, it may indeed cause a rift that will seriously damage their marriage. \n\nSo imo, they\u2019re both being stubborn about it and even though they know it\u2019s making the dad miserable, they\u2019re not giving in. Meanwhile, even so, dad isn\u2019t all that defensible since he didn\u2019t think about how to handle any of this before getting married snd in fact appears to have deliberately avoided it.

Stepmom should be able to put up with the inconvenience for that long.", "She is his child, his daughter. It doesn't mean she is literally a child", "I think is understandable a married couple would prefer an en-suite.\nBut it should be dad to fight this fight", "First - dad is being way to passive and seems afraid to take a stand at all. \n\nSecond - OP has used carefully chosen words but if you read her comments you can discern more of the story. She\u2019s not some new woman, OP didn\u2019t know they were getting married but she did know she was moving in. It sounds like it was a known relationship and based on how difficult OP is being about this, I don\u2019t have to wonder to much about why her dad was afraid to tell her about the marriage. \n\nThird - there are two people sharing a much smaller room. Decency would dictate for most people that you would give up the larger room so that your father (who has sacrificed for her already by taking the smaller room for the past five years) can be comfortable with his wife in a space large enough for two.", "Yes. But she is an adult, who is living for free, and refusing to give the bigger room to TWO people.", "But the person asking is not related to her nor the owner of the house, her father and owner of the house agrees with her.
