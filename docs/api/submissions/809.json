But soon it\u2019s developed into the mother being a million times worse than the kid. Every morning like clockwork she screams at her kid and continues it into the hallway @ 9am everyday. I work from home and my partner can\u2019t get a lie in on the weekends so it\u2019s been difficult working with it. I eventually opened the door one night and asked she close hers as she was shouting too loud, she shut her door and I assumed she got the idea I can hear a lot more than expected. But no, 2 days later she has me and my partner up at 7am on a Saturday shouting at her kid again. My partner goes over and when he knocked she basically opened it and then closed the door on his face.

Worst part, the welfare lady was agreeing saying that we likely don\u2019t have children and couldn\u2019t possibly understand; really emphasising a motherhood struggle. After this I opened my door and said \u201cwe have explained time and time again that we forgive you have a child but not the way you scream at her.

I can't even imagine what it's like to be a refugee -- everything new and different, language barrier, money concerns, etc., and having a kid. Not suggesting it's okay that she screams at her kid, but yelling at her from another apartment isn't going to help reduce the tension across the hall. So what if her social worker thinks less of you than you like? She was probably trying to relate to a struggling mother. When parents are desperate, the fear and anger get taken out on whoever is nearby -- the kid. A quiet word with the social worker, maybe. But more yelling is only going to make things worse.

It needs to be addressed and proper help given to both the mother and the child. Whoever was doing the welfare check needed it to be made aware of the situation.  The fact that the screaming happens every day at roughly the same time, probably has great significance of some kind or another beyond whatever might be the seeming cause of the screaming. However, as I do not know what they have escaped from or what their exact circumstances were before they got to your flats I will not speculate on what it might actually be.\n\nNow please speak to building management and let them know exactly what has been going on for the past year and what just happened.
