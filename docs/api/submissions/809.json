It needs to be addressed and proper help given to both the mother and the child. Whoever was doing the welfare check needed it to be made aware of the situation.  The fact that the screaming happens every day at roughly the same time, probably has great significance of some kind or another beyond whatever might be the seeming cause of the screaming.

How everyday this person has her door open and shouts at her child for extended periods of times. If I remembered specifics I would have shared them. Then again I would probably had reported it way before. The way you opened the door sort of yelled and then closed the door doesn't really make you look like the voice of reason. I hope the social worker actually believed something you said.\n\nAnd for me the social worker is also an AH. Why the heck is she having this conversation with the freaking door open? Are these people crocodiles that their tail somehow prevents them from closing the door? I don't know if the empathizing with that woman was real or fake, she might have been saying those things as a way to gain trust, if she wasn't I think it was also negligent that she didn't ask more about the situation. I would assume is her job to help this people feel safe so a crazy rude neighbor kinda doesn't help with that.", "Nta. Report her to social services. ( cps) in the uk.", "You\u2019re a saint. You wake me up at 7am on the weekend we are gonna fight. And seeing as I am not a morning person and I turn into satan when it happens I will win the fight.

And you handed her back all her lies when you stated what you said.  I bet the child services person was flummoxed/and your neighbor's child had NEVER had anyone validate them.", "NTA, She's abusing her kid. I would report her or call the cops every time she does that shit honestly. Might end up saving that kids life", "NTA \n\nWe're always told we 'never know what goes on behind closed doors'... (or in your case open? doors!) - That kid is 7 & she's constantly being screamed at - That is with the door OPEN... imagine what could be happening when the door is closed?? \n\nI'm glad you told welfare, they need to be looking into this, it's not fair on the little girl to live with such abuse :( \n\nGood for you OP, keep standing your ground x", "NTA\n\nThe nerve of blaming you for her screeching at a child.   \nYou had to set the record straight before this could impact your life.", "NTA. \n\nHaving lived next door to an asylum seeker house for 15 years in the past where many of the families were single parents with you g children, the woman you saw was likely an assigned support worker.  It seems they do ask if there are any issues with neighbours as you can probably imagine not everyone is welcoming.   Some of my lovely neighbours had real issues with a minority in the street who were racist bullies.  \n\nBut hopefully the worker will have the sense to work out that if no one else has complained about you, that the issue is with her and she'll be aware this woman is likely going through a tough time and doesn't have a great parenting style.   Hopefully both mother and daughter will be supported.", "NTA. I would have reported her for verbal abuse of the child long before her welfare checker came around. \n\nI\u2019m 54 y/o & just realizing (thru therapy) just how badly the verbal abuse I endured most of my childhood damaged me. The physical abuse, yeah I always knew that wasn\u2019t right. Suspected the psychological abuse, so it wasn\u2019t hard to wrap my head around. The verbal abuse has impacted every aspect of my life, & not for the better. So. I will speak for children who cannot speak for themselves.", "NTA, but you're not doing enough when this poor child is in a possibly abusive situation.", "~~That went on for a year, and you didn't do anything to help that child? Until the welfare check happened, the only thing you're concerned about is the impact the noise had on you. You heard this child being abused every day for a year, and you were only annoyed because it was loud enough to stop you and your partner sleeping in.You're not TA for being honest with the welfare check (And the only reason you said anything is that she tried to throw you under the bus, if she hadn't done that you would have walked on without a single word), but Y T A for knowing that was happening and doing nothing.~~  \n\n\nNTA probably would have added in the multiple steps you've taken to help this child in the main - but I know when you're heated up about something like this, sometimes you accidentally miss bits.  \nI have agoraphobia too, I've gotten to the point where I can function pretty okay (Though without my meds I would be screwed) but I still remember that part of not being able to leave the house for very long periods. This morning, despite your debilitating agoraphobia, you left to go WTF at this person when you heard it start again. I hope you realize what a huge step that is. It is such a crippling disorder, but when you heard her start on that little girl again, you left your safe space and went to confront her.", "NTA but what happened next?

Document everything", "NTA, you did the right thing", "Show me the handbook that states MILs obligations. We have  become so entitled in our thinking and behaviour so much so that went the status quo is broken criticism is disguised as support", "Agree. My fathers idea of punishment was to yell at me for hours and inform me of how stupid and wrong I was for whatever reason.", "Yap, that's good.\n\nBetter if she have gotten the name of the welfare checker (is that the term?) so that she could report / call directly once the shouting begins. That way, neighbor will mind the shouting (if she remembers).", "This is very helpful and specific advice. I concur.

I have heard another round of screaming abuse and bashing this morning. It\u2019s become so upsetting I ran over to ask her why all the noise and what is happening but she suddenly drops her English and pretends to not understand (I know she speaks really good English). Reported to child services once more in hopes something will be done this time round", "Oh I know. Child services failed me from age 5 and upwards. 23 now and trying not to see it happen again.

It\u2019s the language barrier that makes this harder and the fact I am also agoraphobic. I have a case number for child services and the only thing I realise I must do now is get the police round at the hours she starts her abuse like clockwork.

I\u2019m agoraphobic and haven\u2019t left my flat in months but I step out that door every time for that kid.  I\u2019ve done a lot and I think I\u2019m allowed to feel upset about the discomfort that has come from this.", "I\u2019m gonna need to beg Mods to highlight my comment but I already have reported this.

I went round and asked wtf was going on and she immediately went silent and stared at me. I am at a loss and have called the child services once again", "Poor wording from me I was upset.

Poor child..", "Glad you did, hopefully you were heard.", "Thank goodness, I hope they come quickly now that you\u2019ve spoken to the welfare checker", "So, first, I am really sorry you have been through so much, I am glad you are not there anymore and I hope one day you can beat your agoraphobia.\n\nNow, you must realize how things read. In your original post, without the edit you basically said \"awful person yells at child nonstop and I can't work, I heard them complaining about me and I told them off and closed the door\". Your whole post was a list of why this was an inconvenience to you and nothing else. If you had told us from the get go you had called social services and you have agoraphobia the responses would have been different. Also the y t a in this reddit doesn't mean you are the worst ever, it just means that in that given situation you were. You can't judge a whole person for the one post. To me according to your original post you were an AH too, now with this new Info I think you are not an AH. Just the mother and the social worker.\n\nI am guessing you feel you need to justify yourself and that is why you insisted so much on how this was an inconvenience to you. You don't need to justify yourself so much. A person has her door open in the morning and yells non stop to her child, she is awful. \n\nIn the great scheme of things it would have been better if you had told the social worker the situation in a more collected way without closing the door. But given your agarophobia you really put yourself out there. You have a right to your space being respected. And someone yelling like that across the hallway with the door open is  not being respectful of your space.\n\nDoes your partner also have agarophobia? If not ask them to handle this if it happens again. If you know when the social worker shows up you can let them know.\n\nIn any case when you come to this reddit to ask for judgment you give limited information, but even in real life with more information many times is hard to judge someone correctly. Despite that people agreed here that the woman is an AH and some also thought you were an AH as well because they thought you didn't care about the child and you hadn't contacted social services. You are surprised people thought that when your post said nothing to indicate otherwise. Basically don't worry if someone thought that, people judged based in the information given, it seemed you hadn't called social services, you had, that cancels the y t a. I understand is probably hard for you to distance yourself from the feeling that it is unfair people thought that about you because your history and well because you had actually talked to social services, etc. But isn't it unfair to ask people to assume you did things and thought things that you didn't list in the post?\n\nYou did good, I hope social services helps that child. You could send them an email explaining the situation and telling them what happened and how you have seen no improvement and from what you could tell the social worker was basically agreeing with this woman instead of talking about the abuse.", "Just having a read through your comments now, I only scrolled so far before, and editing to reflect", "Then you are no means an asshole in any shape or form, keep pressing. You could be the light at the end of the tunnel for that poor girl", "Yeah, it really doesn\u2019t come off that way to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f it comes off very \u201cI don\u2019t want to live around domestic violence survivors and it makes my life harder to have to have people check in.", "C o n t e x t ?", "> I was pleased as I worried it was mothers of domestic abuse as I\u2019d never seen any fathers and the front desk security wouldn\u2019t let my partner come in without heavy questioning one time\n\nThe above from OPs post - would hint at this.", "The language barrier and the fact she has a caseworker. God you are impossible", "Appreciate your response and I\u2019m taking this all onboard.

No doubt the child has already experienced trauma as well in the country of origin, and doesn't need more. OP did the right thing in speaking to the social worker, but should have done it much sooner.", "Common sense would say that If I am at home, doors closed - and I want someone to hear a weird noise I hear (to investigate) - you can record.\n\nYou (as recording person) cannot help it if someone screeches so loud that it\\`s audible in your own home...\n\nBut laws are not always common sense..", "There is a lot of confusion but what I do know for sure is that the lady who was outside with her referred to herself as the lady/ \u201ccase worker\u201d.

I think it's more of a \"we understand you have a kid...\"", "The person was being a dick.", "In some countries in the world, you're not allowed to record people even in public spaces without consent! I think some European countries have laws like that.", "Yes don't worry it happens. Also trauma takes a long time to heal and sometimes we react in unexpected ways. The important thing is that despite your trauma you are stepping out of your comfort zone to help that child. I really hope social services listen.", "Then that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean welfare.", "Good to know thanks"]}
