People shouldn't push if they don't want to know the answer.  \n\n...but let me share with you my daughter's and my fave little \"escape\" on that.  \n\n\nThe word \"interesting.\"   Many moons ago, when dirt was new, I was going through a horrendous financial hardship.  \n\nOne of the few little guilty pleasures I had was to go to some area thrift stores.  As it happens, there were several of them that had massive sales once a month, on Wednesdays, and a church that had free clothing on that same day.  \n\n\nSo, I'd go get my daughter (who was in Jr. High at the time) out of school and we'd go clothing shopping.  Sometimes we'd find some real wins.   But at the church thrift store, the little old lady volunteers were always finding \"darling\" clothes for us that were... not so darling.  \n\n\nWe'd politely take them \"oh, those are so interesting!\" and dutifully go try them on ...but alas...they never fit us.  (though I did take one muumuu with beautiful material and made it into a skirt and vest).  :D  \n\n\nThus was born our favorite secret code word \"interesting.\"  We still use it to this day, and the rest of our family adopted it too.  It can be said in the sweetest and most enthusiastic way, and it can be taken by the audience in a positive way, and they'll never know.  \n\n\nIt's sort of a whiter white lie.  Which are sometimes needed in day to day interactions with other humans.  :D", ">Linda asked what I thought of her hair.\n\nNTA. Fishing for compliments doesn't always bear fruit. I've gotten tons of haircuts in my life, I'm 32m. I've **never once** asked anyone for an opinion about it. I appreciate it when they lie to my face and say it looks good, but I just can't imagine why I would ever ask or care.

I think lying can be considered kind sometimes, but you also shouldn't directly ask someone what they think about your look if you're just looking for praise.

Truth seeker lol", "ESH she was clearly fishing for compliments, but you could have been slightly less obvious about your dislike of her haircut, too.", "Soft YTA.
