I want to work this out but I feel like him not even acknowledging or apologizing for speaking bad about me behind my back shows that he doesn\u2019t really care. \n\nI\u2019m giving him one more day to be mad and if he refuses to talk I\u2019m asking him to move out.

You should not be guilt tripping him (i dont think you are), but if he feels that way  you guys arent right for each other anymore. \nPerhaps it can be fixed with a wakeup call, perhaps it cant. \n\nBut you are not unreasonable for wanting a bf who actually care for you and wants to spend time with you.

He also waited until they moved and she was basically stranded with him to very bluntly tell her that he doesn't really want to be together, that he doesn't love her or really even like her, but they've been together so long and he can't afford to live by himself so it's easier to just stay with her. \ud83d\ude21 Yeah... he's a real winner....", "I have dated someone similar before, he would not be upset, he just wants to play video games, in fact he might get annoyed at getting a cake or gift because that might come with the string attached called \"spend maybe 2 hours with me\" which he could instead spend on video games", "I think they\u2019re just saying that without reminding him, OP would rarely get more than one text reply an hour, not that they expected him to reply consistently multiple times for hours"]}
