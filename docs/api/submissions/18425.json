I mostly do what I want while she\u2019s working (watch my shows, bit of gaming, on the phone to friends etc.), but as soon as she\u2019s finished, I stop my own things and find stuff for us to do together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together 3 years and there\u2019s no way I could even imagine her birthday coming around and me doing nothing. Not even a cake?? Everyone deserves a cake on their birthday\u2026 But playing video games on your birthday and leaving you to go on a walk on your own? And then bitch about you being upset to his friends? He clearly has no common decency and you deserve a lot better\u2026", "NTA, boot him. He clearly cares more about games than you. Sorry this happened.\n\nAlso soft YTA for going thru his phone. I firmly believe you should never snoop thru peoples private stuff.", "\"just bc it was my birthday\"  \n\n\nIf this is how he treats your birthday when you're young and just starting out then I'm sorry to tell you that this is as good as it'll get. If you stay with him you can look forward to \n\n* birthdays by yourself\n* no cards\n* either none or gas station presents\n* no restaurant dinners\n* a pervasive feeling of disappointment\n\nKick him out.", "NTA. Break up and throw him out. It is not like he truly is a BF to you anymore.", "NTA. Don't wait another day. Evict him and dump him. His priorities are not you and this will only get worse. He's just using you for a cheap place to stay. If he loves his buddies so much, he can relocate back home and move in with them.", "We w", "NTA \u2026. You better than me because I wouldn\u2019t be giving him a day it would be OVER TODAY & he would have to be gone immediately . I\u2019d be giving him eviction papers QUICK \u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f\u203c\ufe0f", "NTA. Dump him. You deserve way better.", "NTA. Ask him to move out and dump him. This way he doesn\u2019t need to be inconvenienced by his girlfriend\u2019s BIRTHDAY; instead, he can spend all his time playing video games with his friends and you can find a new boyfriend who actually values you.", "Sounds like he has an addiction.", "NTA ...he is not your bf, he just wants to ride with you", "NTA. Dump him.", "NTA\nHow does this guy work? You are not a priority for him. He's not contributing to the household. Ask him to move out. Make your boundaries for him very clear and keep your standards.", "NTA. You sound like a lovely, caring, considerate person. You are also an adult who has left home, found a job and organised your life. You are complete and sufficient. Good on you! He, on the other hand, is a child. He wants the safety and security of your support, but doesn\u2019t want to be in an adult relationship with you. What he wants is for you to take care of him and not ask anything in return. You will perhaps choose to have a baby one day, and gladly give them unconditional love. This chap, however is not your child. His behaviour and attitude are unacceptable. Show him the door and change the locks pronto.", "NTA. I think this relationship has run its course", "NTA. He clearly didn't move cross country for you if he doesn't even want to spend time with you, especially on your birthday.", "Uncool move to check the phone.\nYou should never do that again, to anyone.\n\nThat said, NTA. You made it clear that if he moved, it wasn't just for you. He knew what he got himself into, he's a grown man. Kick him out and break up.\nHe's not willing to make time for you, he's not boyfriend material.", "Ohmygod girl, dump him right now. NTA but you WBTA to yourself if you stayed in this relationship", "Exactly!", "Reading this it sounds like he's just interested in what's in it for him.\n\nI can't see what you get out of it, except for heartache.\n\n1.5 years isn't long in the context of the rest of your life, and you deserve to be happy. If he doesn't make you happy, and isn't willing to change, take out the trash and change the locks.", "But ... he's not with you. Not physically or emotionally. I'm sorry but I think he's using you. Perhaps he's the bad habit you need to break.", ">We have been together for over 1.5 years.\n\nEwww. You put up with this for 1.5 years? I heard they're giving away self respect at the local Costco. Go get some.", "I play a lot of games every day (that I can), but my job, girlfriend, pets, and household responsibilities have to come first, lol. Get you a guy who understands some semblance of balance in life", "It's *insane*! Like, I married a guy who works, sleeps, and games. He games maybe 4 hours a night maximum during the week (though if he finished work at 3pm it'd be more like 6). But we still have dates and do stuff together because him gaming all night is \"default\", not mandatory!", "Guess who must do all the housework and cooking... She got a lazy bum.", "And works less than he games !!! NTA op", "Rookie numbers", "He is looking for a bang maid, honey.", "You are not a girlfriend. You are a mother, and he is essentially getting a free ride, to work and play games. He is earning (and presumably saving) all his money, while you slowly go broke.  \nYou need to answer for yourself whether you want this future.  \n\nWishing you all the best.", "Ok no judgment for sure but like man you don\u2019t deserve to do this to yourself. NTA! By a mile! Please dump this man, life is shoooorrrrt!", "He's only lived with you a WEEK. Things are not going to get better when the \"honeymoon\" is over. You're already violating his privacy and he already resents you. NTA", "Yeah.....i used to work in the gaming industry and 9 hours is actually bonkers. I always split my time up to hang out with my partner, family and do house jobs.\n\nSo I'd sometimes hit 12 hours a day but it was in increments of 3-4 hours and that was as my JOB\n\n9 hours on top of another job and ignoring your partner is bats**t insane\n\nSounds like BF wanted to move but not for OP, just for an easy place to stay. His behaviour is unacceptable", "Oh, she said as much in the comments:\n\n>Yes I do most the housework. I cleaned almost the entire apartment by myself today while he was out golfing\n\nBecause *in addition* to the excessive amount of gaming he does\u2026he also takes time to *golf*.", "Doesn't look like love to me.

He seems like hr couldn't give a f...k  about your wants and feel8ngs.", ">I had to remind him a few times to respond to me more than once an hour. \n\nUmmm, he is not expected to respond to you multiple times in hour.  He was allowed to do things throughout the day without CONSTANTLY being in contact with him.  Why did you feel he HAD to be in contact with you multiple times in hour?  My partner and I have been mostly long distance our whole relationship and gasp! we can go hours without messaging each other.\n\n\nIf you are like your \"he must text me multiple times per hour or I must remind him to\" in real life well, I understand why he would rather game all day then.  Also, why would you date someone you are so incompatible with and then get upset at them being who they are?", "[removed]", "\u201cMight be\u201d. If he\u2019s playing 9 hours every day then that\u2019s definitely addiction", "Guessing what is me?\n\nI'm not someone in the story lol. I am just someone who used to game a LOT cause I was in the industry. But even as someone who spent 9 years in the industry, I was trying to say that the amount the BF is gaming while ignoring OP is ridiculous, and  I feel so sad for OP.\n\nNo job or hobby is worth ignoring important people in your life", "Which is also not unreasonable (from time to time!) some people even call if a conversation", "Yeah sounds like OP is texting waaaaaaay too much. Unless it is something requiring immediate attention, like I am at the take out place and need to know what to get you, I don't need to have tons of texts from you during the day when you are off doing other things.", "That's exactly what someone in the story would say, deny it again and we'll all know it's definitely you!", "Yeah i agree", "Yeah I get that, but you say that as if he isn\u2019t playing his games and talking shit about his girlfriend to his friends for 9+ hours a day. Putting the girlfriend aside for just a second, 9+ hours of gaming a day is unhealthy as fuck and probably contributes to his faltering sense of reality. \n\n He moved in with her, basically refuses to see or speak to her, *straight up refused* to spend any time with her on her birthday (so he could play games) and then told his friends she was annoying for wanting to spend time with her, and that he doesn\u2019t like hanging out with her. \nWhy the fuck is he living there? \n\nOP is at fault for some parts but jesus christ that \u201cboyfriend\u201d can\u2019t even truthfully label himself as a man.", "Like, they were long distance? So, you know, texting was pretty much the main way to keep the relationship going. Your takeout example isn't relevant because you then get home and actually spend time with your SO. Responding once an hour when you're long-distance means you talk a whooping three sentences a day to a person you supposedly care about (let's say an average adult has about 3 hours a day when they are free to type at will). Wanting more is normal, nowhere near \"waaaaay too much\".", "I'm so confused \ud83d\ude02\n\nOk who am I supposed to be here, OP, the BF or the video games? \ud83e\udd14", "Although I fully agree with you here, please stop putting some weird picture around the concept of \"being a man\"", "As a woman i\u2019d step up and help my friend or partner in that situation, i guess i worded it wrongly so that\u2019s my bad but i did mean humans in general\n\n\nedit: hold on y\u2019all ignore this because i thought i was replying to another thread", "NTA.", "Nta. This is not thean for you.", "Yeh.. What a shitty boyfriend.", "NTA. This guy prioritises games over you, he made this clear on your birthday. Sure, you shouldn't have gone through his phone but nevertheless he has shown how little you matter to him. \n\nHe could have a game addiction but that doesn't excuse his selfish behaviour. It would be best for you to end the relationship as soon as possible, maybe that will give him a wake up call.", "Dump him . He sounds like a waste of space.", "Don\u2019t give him one more day. He moaned about you to his friends because he thought it was outrageous that he should spend a second thinking about you on your BIRTHDAY!!! How many more chances do you want to give him to treat you like dirt before you\u2019re going to pick up your backbone? He\u2019s not your boyfriend, he\u2019s a parasite.", "NTA. DUMP HIM!!!

He doesn't love you or care for you, you're a hindrance to what he wants to do. His friends are no better if they didn't pull him up, especially as it was your birthday. They obviously know he's just using you. \n\nHe's probably only planning on staying with you until he can get his own place or he's hoping you'll soon have enough of his crap and move out yourself so he doesn't have to waste any of his \"precious\" gaming/golfing time looking for his own apartment.\n\n>It was my apartment first and he has only paid the $70 application fee\n\nHave his application cancelled immediately, tell them you don't want him there. Do this urgently before you ask him to leave.", "You are being used.

I would have ended my birthday with throwing him out.", "He's not willing to put the effort in for you, is insulting you behind your back and to your face while you trust him so little that you're snooping through his phone. There's nowhere for this relationship to go but down.\n\nHe's mostly TA, but you did do one A thing -- which you clearly recognise. I'm leaning towards this being NTA, but it would be a case of ESH if you hadn't acknowledged that snooping through your partner's phone is a red flag moment that shouldn't be happening.\n\nYou're right to end this now and tell him to move out. While it's a shame you couldn't figure this out before the big move, not everyone is able to do that. Sometimes you do have to move in together before you can truly see how incompatible you are. However, don't ever stay with a partner who is readily insulting you to his friends the moment your back is turned and who doesn't even care about you to your face.\n\nIt's actually a really good thing that you've recognised all the red flags so quickly after moving in and are preparing to act now on them. Many people suffer for months or years until their confidence is absolutely ruined. You are absolutely right -- for your own peace of mind -- to respond immediately to the red flags and end this before it has a chance to bed in. The longer this goes on, the harder it'll be to get him out of the house.", "Please update us", "nta i dont think he cares about you he can go back home live with his mother and play video games ...... is it just me or do people who love playing video games have no real connection to humans every time i read on reddit about some guy who is emotionally mentally an physically unavailable for their SO its also someone who loves to play video games", "NTA - you don't know why he moved but I bet his parents kicked him out of their basement and you were the next best option.  No relative would take him in .  \n\nYou've only known him a short time.  He's not really your boyfriend.  He sees you as somebody who will be a co-roommate with benefits.\n\nHe didn't leave any friends behind.

Op, I'm sorry, but he only cares about the status of a relationship.\n\nHonestly, this would make me never hang out properly again because the thought of me being such an annoying, uninteresting person accordingly to my own boyfriend would always cross my mind. \n\nAnd god knows what else he says about you. \n\nYou would not be the AH for dumping his ass, you would be doing yourself a favor.", "NTA girl, this is gaslighting at its finest.
