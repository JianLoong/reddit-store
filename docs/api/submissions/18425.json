I mostly do what I want while she\u2019s working (watch my shows, bit of gaming, on the phone to friends etc.), but as soon as she\u2019s finished, I stop my own things and find stuff for us to do together. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together 3 years and there\u2019s no way I could even imagine her birthday coming around and me doing nothing. Not even a cake?? Everyone deserves a cake on their birthday\u2026 But playing video games on your birthday and leaving you to go on a walk on your own?

While it's a shame you couldn't figure this out before the big move, not everyone is able to do that. Sometimes you do have to move in together before you can truly see how incompatible you are.

Doesn\u2019t matter why he moved, doesn\u2019t matter what was said. Just kick him out because he is disrespectful and he cannot even muster enough effort to acknowledge your birthday. You deserve better!!!!!", "I know this seems like a long time now, but after a while it'll seem like nothing. Living with someone is how you truly find out if you are compatible in the long run, and clearly you two aren't. Honestly you're dodging a bullet, if he doesn't even want to spend time with you how would you two actually build a life together?", "But he clearly doesn't love you. He doesn't want to spend time with you, hurts you casually and is fine with it, and does fuckall for your birthday. That's not love. That's someone using you for something, but finding the interaction necessary to get what he wants irritating.", "Why? Why do most woman automatically take on all the housework? I will never understand this.", "Honey, you deserve better! Kick him out and change the locks.", "You\u2019re lucky your soon to be ex is showing this behavior early tbh. You could end up married and with a kid then feel completely trapped. Do you want to be your partner\u2019s parent? Do you want to be a live-in maid/roommate? Or do you want to be with someone who loves YOU and is a partner to YOU to do life together (and doesn\u2019t just see you as an accessory). \n\nI live that life. It sucks. Please do what\u2019s best for you.", "Trust me... 45 year old you will wonder why dumping him was ever a question to begin with.", "Please stop begging this guy for scraps of attention. What would you say if it was your sister or one of your girlfriends telling you their partner treats them like this?", "Why would you want to be with someone who views hanging out with you as a chore.\n\nI can't imagine wanting to kiss or love someone who doesn't even want to spend time with me on my birthday....", "You deserve better!  Don\u2019t think this will change. Don\u2019t think that if you have sex he loves you.  Cut him loose!", ">a bouquet of arsehole with hints of misogyny\n\nThis is poetry right here \\^ please take my upvote", "What does he do for work that he has this much free time?", "Gamer couple here too, we absolutely make time for other things (uless we're playing something together which is our version of date nights lol)", "You deserve better!!", "Yep. This would be an ultimatum where either he seeks help for a gaming addiction or gtfos.", "ESH only because you shouldn't have checked his phone, He definitely should not have been chatting shit about you. Ignoring your birthday after moving in with you is a good enough reason to kick someone out.", "NTA kick him to the curb", "This guy is dating you to have a roof over his head. NTA and good luck.", "Why did he move in with you? Did he need a roommate? Because you're just his roommate. NTA", "You\u2019re dating a bum. Dump him. You\u2019re too young to be treated like your insignificant.", "NTA\n\nhe is not your boyfriend.\n\nkick him out.", "I have a friend like this, well not really a friend anymore as I haven't spoken to him in a couple of years. All he does is play video games in all his spare time. He won't even bother to return a text message. My wife saw his wife recently at a mutual friend's baby shower. She cried so much as he never spends any time with her. He expects her to do all the housework and cooking while he just plays his games. They have a son together and he made him just like him. That's how he spends \"quality\" time with him. It's sad because of his lack of playing outside and no participation in any sports he is a very big boy. He is also learning this is how a man should be like.  \nYou should leave this guy who just plays video games everyday or this will end up being your life.", "NTA but you guys probably need to have more healthy communication with one another if your relationship continues, or for whatever relationship you have in the future (with anyone else). Let out expectations, talk about why you\u2019re hurt, try to come to an understanding. Going through someone else\u2019s phone isn\u2019t justified, and just tells me you both still have work to do on yourselves. But once again, you\u2019re NTA.", "NTA. Cover yourself legally and financially. Is he in a position to squat there? Mess up your lease or  dump all the rent on you? If you don't work out a new platonic living arrangement, you may need a new lease. If you can't, may need to get an attorney.\n\n(I am not an attorney)", "When you ask him to leave, please block him and his friends on your phone and SM.\n\nBecause he will become the victim in his story, and twist everything around.    \nSo, it will be much easier if you preemptively block him and his friends and possibly his family, you do not need to hear their thoughts on his version of the truth.\n\nGood Luck.", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t dump this guy, because you deserve sooooo much better!", "I don\u2019t understand people who can do this for hours at a time I use to be addicted to games but I smashed my laptop and the addiction broke", "Nta!", "NTA- and i feel like the comments are roasting me at the same time but yer the comments are right dating a guy who all they do is play games and make next to no effort for you is just not a way to be happy.", "NTA. Sounds like he just wanted a new roof to live under.", "OP, are you sure he moved for you? When he doesn't even bother to spend time with you on your bday, and all he does is play videogames with his friends for over 8 hours per day and badmouth you to them? He can do that from his own/parent's house.", "NTA. He games from 3-12 every day? He\u2019s irritated because you wanted him to spend time with you on your birthday? What are you getting out of this relationship? Give him $70 and dump that child.", "Adding to this to say I had a boyfriend like this (now EX). I have no problems with video games, I love playing them too! But he played them so often, it felt like I had to beg for his time, and if I was lucky I'd get a 1 or 2 hour time slot. Any date we ever went on was my idea and I planned. It gets exhausting. You are a partner, not his mother. The cherry on top is him complaining about spending time with you. My ex did that too. My current bf would never. Again, your his partner. Do you really see a future with someone who doesn't even want to spend time with you???", "NTA. \n\nAre you sure he's 23 and not 13? Kick the little boy out and cut your losses.", "NTA why did he even bother to move when he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with you", "Girl, run. NTA", "ESH you for going threw his phone BIG TIME. Everyone bitchs about thier significant other to thier friends. Thats what friends are for. He hasn't paid bills yet. Well he just moved across the country. That might be a big reason why. He should have spent some time with you on your Bday. He needs to \"plan\" things for your bday?", "You will end up doing everything in this relationship including all housework, shopping and cooking. Because all he does is play video games. Even if he pays his share of the bills... you are not his mother.  NTA", "NTA. You don't have a bf, you have a pet leech.", "NTA. That being said, what was his life like before moving. Is this something he did previously? Moving away from everyone and everything you know can be a shock to the system for anyone. I'd give him some leeway as he adjusts and see if things change.", "NTA kick him out, sounds like he just wants a bang maid and doesnt even like you.", "He didn't move cross country for you, he can't even be bothered to spend an hour or two with you on your birthday.\n\nHe moved to have a bang maid and cheap housing.\n\nThis is not what love and respect look like, you can do better.\n\nNTA", "NTA - oh hell no. He doesn\u2019t even like you.", "NTA. \n\nYou gave it a shot and it\u2019s not working out. Don\u2019t fall into a sunk cost fallacy and break it off.", "When someone shows you who they are believe them the first time. -Maya Angelou\n\nHe\u2019s a grown ass man who\u2019s acting like a teenager,he sounds dull.   you deserve better.  NTA tell him to pack his stuff and get out.", "NTA. Don\u2019t wait, just kick him out and end the relationship. He very obviously doesn\u2019t feel bad for hurting your feelings, he\u2019s just mad you found out. He can\u2019t even spend some time with you on your freakin\u2019 birthday. You deserve better. Don\u2019t let him gaslight you into thinking you\u2019re overreacting or something, because you\u2019re not.", "Well, if you wanted a boyfriend, you got one.  He's ALL boy", "NTA. Kick him out already.", "NTA - he\u2019s a waste of time and space as a potential life partner. He has no time for you and it is completely unclear why he moved -,unless he just fancied moving to a different part of the country for kicks -,because whatever it was, it absolutely wasn\u2019t to be with you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Cut your loses and get him out now.", "Nta. Dang girl, run, your not his priority and you never will be, this isnt going to get better, he needs to leave, y\u2019all need to break up. You deserve better", "NTA. It sounds like you're dating a hardcore gamer though and you might just not be compatible anymore. Granted i woulda thought that when i saw your comment about needing to ask him to respond. A serious conversation is definitely needed.", "Just reading the tagline I was ready to come in here to call you out.\n\nBut what you're describing is a living nightmare and if he can't be a goddamn grown up then yeah throw his ass out You're not his mother Jesus Christ. \n\nMy background: I love me some video games but it sounds like he has a real addiction. I've also been married for about 10 years and play games before I met my wife. When you commit to someone and move in with them there has to be some expected changes and the idea that he is not even beginning to meet halfway is an alarming sign. Don't let him gaslight you into thinking that you're the problem. You sound more than reasonable and the fact that you're really trying to still work things out shows that you're the adult in the room.\n\nNta: Buddy needs to grow the f****** and you need to tell him that he did not move from one mother to another.", "He doesn't care about you.  You are a convenience and a sucker for tolerating this.", "I think the most disturbing thing is that he doesn't want to spend time with OP. He accused her of using her birthday to guilt trip him into spending time with her. If you don't want ho spend time with your partner, especially this early in the relationship, why are you together?", ">ent first and he has only paid the $70 application fee (no rent, water, or electricity yet) AITA for telling hi\n\nAnd throw that $70 app fee out with the rest of his stuff. WTF, living at your place rent free?! It sounds like you're raising a teenage boy and not building a life with a partner.", "Sorry sister. He doesn\u2019t care about you. Dump him. OR be miserable all your life.", "    \"I would like to hope...\"\n\nThe way you phrase your reply speaks volumes. Not \"I would hope he...\" You want to hope. You don't even hope. You'd be amazed at how quickly 1.5 yrs turns into 5 or even 10 years, all spent waiting to hope or hoping for that change or proof of love. Kick him out now and use years that could be wasted to move forward to true happiness. \nNTA.", "Actions speak louder than words. Based solely on his actions and disregarding anything he's said, how do you think he feels about you and the relationship?", "That bothers me a lot, too. Especially if he is the kind of person who expects at least some attention/effort from his SO on his birthday. That's why I wonder if he moved in to save himself from finding a place to live.", "Bold of you to assume this man is employed", "Wait. You expected him to respond to texts every hour or more than that? Do I have that right? That's too clingy. I'm leaning toward ESH, if only because you both should have known this was a bad idea. You have incompatible attachment styles. You need constant attention, and he wants to be left alone.\n\nIn any case, he should move out. Give him a reasonable time frame to find his own place.", "He plays golf? Revolting", "Thankyou, I felt like waxing poetic in my comment and I return to you an upvote because you enjoyed my comment lol. I dunno why I'm talking like this. It's sunny here for the first time in ages. Maybe it's that lol", "I went through a breakup last year after 9 years and my absolute lack of interest gets me down until I scroll Reddit and half the posts are \"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to wipe his ass?\"\n\nIf these are the guys who pull women I'll wear my single-Ness with pride \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah I think so haha\n I dunno why the second guy is being downvoted! I thought they were joking! Which is why I joked back haha"]}
