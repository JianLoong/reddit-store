My boyfriend (23M) just moved in with me (23F) a week ago cross country from our same home state.

But I made it very clear not to move just for me, only if it\u2019s what he wants. \n\nWell my bf loves playing videogames and playing with his home friends and I understand he\u2019s far away and misses them but he plays from 3pm-midnight almost every day leaving no time for us to hang out. \n\nMy birthday recently happened and he asked to play videogames that day I was shocked/upset and went for a walk by myself. He ended up played videogames for hours on my bday and didn\u2019t plan ANYTHING for me, didn\u2019t get me flowers or even a cake. \n\nThe next morning I had a feeling he was talking  bad about me in his friends gc which I know they have done before so the morning after my bday I checked his phone. He accused me of \u201cguilt tripping\u201d him into spending time with me just bc it was my birthday when he clearly didn\u2019t want to hang out with me. (I have never gone on his phone before, I felt very guilty and later apologized) \n\nI\u2019m not sure if the fact that he didn\u2019t want to spend time with me even my birthday hurts most or the fact that he sees hanging out with me as so miserable/annoying. I brought this up to him and he just got mad that I went on his phone and refuses to talk. I\u2019ve asked multiple times and he keeps on saying no. I want to work this out but I feel like him not even acknowledging or apologizing for speaking bad about me behind my back shows that he doesn\u2019t really care. \n\nI\u2019m giving him one more day to be mad and if he refuses to talk I\u2019m asking him to move out. It was my apartment first and he has only paid the $70 application fee (no rent, water, or electricity yet) AITA for telling him to move out and leave after he just moved cross country for me?", "created_utc": 1685323582, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13uh36l/aita_for_asking_my_bf_to_move_out_a_week_after_he/", "score": 108, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Did he regularly game 9 hours a day before or is this something new?  \n\nIt doesn't really matter.  This relationship is already over, even if you don't realize it yet.  I'm just wondering if this is entirely new behavior for him or something you really should have seen coming, and at that point, if he's miserable being around you, and you don't want him spending all of his free time not spending it with you, then what the hell were you thinking moving in together, let alone moving across the country and moving in together???", "NTA and you can do better than this :)", "NTA he\u2019s no good.

He doesn't sound like he's being very good to you.  \n\nBut I'd first try to see if this can be resolved.  The key is don't attack- if you attack he'll get defensive and then you lose the opportunity to get him to recognize his mistakes.  So talk to him.  Don't mention his actions or use 'you' at all.  Only talk about how YOU feel.  Talk about how YOU'RE lonely.  Then try to make a plan with him during the day.  Ask him to dinner.  Something like that.  \n\nGive this at least 2-3 tries.  If it fails, then be more direct.  'You said you moved out here to be with me.  But since we arrived you've spent as little time with me as possible.  What gives?

He has been communicating- you are not paying attention.", "My stance has always been that if your relationship has gotten to the point where you feel you need to invade your partner's privacy in that way, you should just assume you're going to find whatever bad thing you're looking for and fast forward to breaking up with them. I used to be in a relationship where we both snooped on each other phones and it got incredibly toxic over a long period of time", "Not at college. After we graduated college we were long distance as we lived in the same state but far away cities. During this long distance time he started playing more and I had to remind him a few times to respond to me more than once an hour.", "I can agree with that for sure. For me I was 17 years in with a 12 year old so leaving without proof wasn't really in the cards. I needed proof. I found it. Don't regret snooping for a second.
