My mom would reward us with chips all the time. \n\n\nI was also obese for my age from grades 2-6. No one ever called me fat. But boys would do the typical \"ugh\" if I was mentioned as a partner in any situation sports, or school activities. I grew up very self conscious and decided to make hard changes for myself in grade 7. It was very hard and I didn't become fit until I graduated high school and got myself a gym membership.\n\n\nMy sister and mom have both struggled with their weight and two years ago decided they were going to make hard changes. Diet and exercise. I was very supportive and gave advice for healthier meals when asked.\n\n\nMy sister got a dietician. In the notes she showed me the dietician essentially told her to add more vegetables to her meals. Problem is, all her vegetables will also be slathered in butter, or some other fatty sauce like tahini. This is after I have spent hours explaining macros and how to make sure meals are balanced with all other meals and snacks throughout the day (you will not have a healthy diet if you eat chicken and vegetables in one meal, and also have a granola bar with chocolate as a snack, orange chicken with fried rice for lunch, and a dessert after your healthy dinner). It seems all my advice was ignored.\n\n\nIn two years their blood pressure has gone up, they have visibly gained weight, my mom had a surgery related to the weight, sister had a cancer scare in her colon. All of the issues, the doctors say, are related to their weight and they tell them they need to lose weight.\n\n\nI used to have dinner with them or go out on weekends, but it has always involved eating fried foods which I dont want to do myself so much either. After the cancer scare it has been extremely depressing for me to see how they eat and I have been keeping more of a distance. My sister confronted me and asked why I don't hang out as much. I told her the truth and she blew up at me. She said I have no right to criticize her diet and that she always works hard to cook healthy meals.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nAdding this in for more context: \n\nIn two years I never criticized their eating or told them they need to cut back. I cut myself back from eating activities with them, and explained why when my sister asked.\n\n(I told her I love her and I'm glad that she chose to make changes in her life. But that there have been health scares and I can't bring myself to go out to eat with them because the food choices are super unhealthy and it's hard for me to support those choices).\n\nWe do other things together like playing games from time to time, but she wanted to know why I decline when they invite me to eat with them.", "created_utc": 1688166201, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nez9c/aita_for_avoiding_my_mom_and_sister_because_they/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It seems that she needs a wake-up call or she is just going to continue to get worse", "Look, it's upsetting when people make choices that we know are bad for them.  It's painful to watch someone do things that are harmful to themselves.  But, you cannot control the choices that other people make.  You just can't.  All you can do is love them and help how/when you can without neglecting your own needs.\n\nRefusing to hang out/do things with them isn't going to do anything but further lessen the time you'll have with them.  You don't have to approve of what they eat, but you can't force them to stop eating unhealthy foods unless they really want to.  Eating out with them doesn't mean you're contributing to their food addictions.  Prepare and cook what you want to eat, and encourage them to try different preparation methods if you want to--you could cook a few meals for all of you so that they could try different types of recipes/preparation.\n\nYou might want to look into a concept called radical acceptance.  It's either part of CBT or DBT-can't remember which one off the top of my head.\n\nI'm going to say NAH because you obviously care about them, but being judgy or controlling isn't going to help any of you.  I hope things improve.", "NAH- but I think you need to have some more patience. I grew up this way. This must be so scary for you. But you know that this is going to take a lot of time. It's going to get really bad before it gets better. \n\nMaybe you can compromise here. Nobody said you have to watch this happen. Have a once monthly yoga/hiking date with your sister. You don't have to come over for dinner. You can invite them to a dinner you are cooking. Learn to say no when they say let's get deep fried for lunch. Try to help them find the joy in healthy stuff.\n\nAlso possible colon cancer in a 24 year old is not normal even in a generally unhealthy person please get yourself screened to be safe.", "NAH - I don't think some of these comments are fair. For a lot of people overeating is not only an obsession but an addiction. Many people don't like to see it as such because they don't consider it as serious. \n\nIf someone stayed away from their drug addicted family because they couldn't watch them kill themselves anymore would everyone just expect them to stick around all the time anyways just because it's their family?", "NTA\n\nYou seem to strongly associate their diet with their mortality.\n\nColorectal cancer (if that's what your sister's cancer scare was) is not strongly correlated with obesity in a young woman.

I told her the truth and she blew up at me.\n\nWhat \"truth\" did you tell her? More specifically did you say \"your diet is shit and it makes you fat\" or \"your diet is making you ill and I don't want you to die because I love you\" ?", "I would say N-T-A for wanting them to get better BUT my verdict is YTA because of the way you express about obesity. Your problem with their lifestyle is not just the health scares, you already despised obesity before that, and you don\u2019t hide it. That is okay, living a healthy lifestyle is the goal, truly, but the way you address certain topics will make people more or less receptive. If you came to me and told me you don\u2019t want to hang with me because of my eating choices and my weight, I would not be able to get past that and into the real underlying issue which is the health. Why? Because that\u2019s how people work. Unless they are currently sick, you can\u2019t really draw that line and expect them to not be offended by it.", "NTA.

You have this time now with them.", "YTA but i think it\u2019s understandable to feel yourself growing distant from family members who you\u2019re scared to lose. that\u2019s natural, but you should question why you feel that way and try to combat it, reminding yourself they need you and you only have a limited time with them. i can tell by the way you wrote about this, you aren\u2019t very empathetic to those who struggle with eating healthy/living a balanced lifestyle. check yourself, you aren\u2019t better than them. everyone has vices. and if they don\u2019t like vegetables, a buttery sauce is not going to be detrimental to their overall health if it helps them get some of those valuable micronutrients and fiber into their diet. instead of avoiding them, try bringing them meals and taking them to healthy spots, being encouraging and loving and proposing activities that aren\u2019t meal centered. but don\u2019t shut them out.", "NTA you\u2019ve tried to be there to support them in ways that you can but as the saying goes \u201cyou can lead a horse to water, but you can\u2019t make it drink\u201d.

And you might as well cut contact on that mom of yours too.  I mean, who needs moms, amiright?  All they ever did for us was love us unconditionally.\n\nYeah, your life will be MUCH better once you stop talking to the people who love you.", "NTA and here\u2019s why. My brother and family distanced themselves from me when I was drinking so excessively not because they didn\u2019t love me but out of fear to losing me to an addiction. \n\nI think it\u2019s harsh to distance yourself from family and scared to lose them I don\u2019t think this is a case of you being fat phobic more than it is just scared of their health. I also am in the same with distance from people who always wanna go eat all the time (I used to be fat) as all of them always wanted to eat garbage like pizza and fried foods and buffets. \n\nIn my opinion NTA.", "NTA at all. Tbh, it is kind of tough to be friends with people who you have dissimilar values from, and who are not happy with themselves. It seems trivial, but it is hard to be close friends or romantically involved with people who you have different views of fitness. However, never talk to someone as if they are less than, nor treat them poorly, but closeness is not always possible when you have different mentalities.", "YTA, nobody said you had to eat what they eat. Unless they're asking for advice, don't offer it. It's that easy.", "NTA. I think your headline is misleading as it over simplifies your situation - it IS difficult to see our loved ones not look after themselves, from smoking, to obesity, to addressing problems surrounding mental health. It's such a complex feeling, but it comes from a place of love and care, I think, not disgust.\n\nI think it's sensible to avoid letting the frustration bubble over by not spending too much time with them. But maybe it's about how you communicate that with them - more 'I find it genuinely difficult to see you not looking after yourselves so, unless and until I can get over that, the fairest thing is for me to distance myself a bit'?", "nope, NTA, the truth for them is too much.  They are addicted to food and won't change without significant help and pressure from sources outside your circle.", "YTA, nothing is worse than a fat-phobic former fat person.  You need to work through your issues so you aren\u2019t hurting other people.  A therapist might be a good start.\n\nFYI- doctors always say to lose weight.  Often times doctors will not take a fat persons health issues seriously, it\u2019s a deadly form of discrimination.", "NTA. To me, this is similar to having an alcoholic parent. Seeing that person or people doing the same thing time and again that is killing them is psychologically painful. Oftentimes these eating habits are addictions just like smoking, drugs, alcohol etc. After the scare I can really understand why it would be triggering for you, especially as you went through it yourself. \n\nI\u2019d bear in mind to make sure you do still see them, but when and in circumstances that it\u2019s not going to hurt you.", "YTA. Controlling your own diet is one thing. (Good for you!) But when you start a mindset that you can't be around people you love because of the way they eat? It looks and feels toxic to me. If you love them spend the time with them. Time is limited.", "NTA", "NTA,\n\nYou\u2019re definitely going to to get hate on this post for it. But given your reasoning, not the ahole here.

HI, I\u2019m literally a former nutrition professional turned clinical researcher.\nWhile oils and fats are rough for energy balance, the difference between eating meals that contain nutrients and fiber with said oils or NOT eating them at all is actually to go for the vegetables. \nMost of my clients did poorly on numbers based diet strategies, be it macros, calories, whatever. Eating habits and patterns are much more important, and harder to break and to make. Getting someone to eat more veggies when their baseline was zero is the first step on getting improved habits. Not only can it be used as a win and a stepping stone, but it\u2019s increasing the total nutrient load of the day, and the fiber load. It\u2019s REALLY hard to overeat when you eat adequate fiber from whole food sources. It\u2019s quite easy to backslide or snack late if you are purely relying on counting or energy restriction.\nYou\u2019re worried about polyps? Ok. But you don\u2019t want them to eat the nutritious foods with fiber that would help with those, because of the presence of oils? Oils increase the bioavailability of many nutrients found in plant based foods. \nYour judgement isn\u2019t helpful. I\u2019ve been there when I was early in my career, in relation to unhealthy family members, and I entirely own that how I judged them and behaved around their choices made me an asshole, not because of some hand wavey emotionally positive nonsense, but because of the hard fact that negative reinforcement fails to create meaningful or lasting change.

I'm sure that the unhealthy eating habits are making OP anxious for them, but it's pretty common for people to automatically equate fat with unhealthy, even when it's not true (I'm not saying it isn't in this case, only looking at the pattern). It's also common for people to seriously overestimate the degree to which a person is eating badly if they look fat, compared to people who don't.

You just know from your sister which may not be a good source. This is like any addiction, you can't help them. They have to want it themselves. No doctor or dietician can help their patient lose weight. They make the recommendations and then it us up to the patient to do something about it. I just saw a patient who I  March found out her diabetes was very uncontrolled (she had stopped taking med). It was a wake up call. She got started on meds for diabetes  (one of them being ozempic so helps with  weight loss) AND she started exercising and eating a lot healthier. She lost 40 lbs in 3 months in addition to getting her diabetes completely under control. And when people go from uncontrolled diabetes to controlled they tend to gain weight because they're no longer peeing out all the sugar. So really she lost the equivalent of 50-60 lbs. Bit she was motivated and worked hard. Unfortunately she's the exception and not the rule. People have to want to change for themselves. Otherwise they will not succeed. \n\nThat said NTA. I don't think it makes you fat phobic to not want to go out and  eat with them. You still want to do things with them just not go out to eat. I don't eat fast food (other than chik fil a nuggets lol) so if people go to Macdonalds or KFC or other crappy palces I might go with them once in a blue moon but certainly not on a regular basis. As a non smoker you would want to hang out with a group of heavy smokers (in a place where they can smoke). Or hang out with drug addicts. Those are just your boundaries.\n\nYou sister just gets mad because she knows she needs to change and that she's already suffering health issues. But rather than taking responsibility for not working on it it's easier to get mad at you and call you fat phobic than assume responsibility for her choices. She can do whatever she wants, but she has to accept the consequences. You don't have to feel obligated to be around them when they eat. \n\nThat's the thing with boundaries. It's to protect yourself without being controlling. You have a boundary (whatever it is) ) and another person can either accept it or not (that goes both ways). And if they don't well then you just aren't compatible when it comes to that boundary and you ( or them) just remove yourself from that particular situation (if you're in a romantic relationship then certain boundaries clearly would mean needing to break up but with friends or family it doesn't have to be all or nothing).", "You\u2019re straight up wrong.

I weigh 135 lbs at 5'2.\n\nI'm not a crazy bodybuilder with a perfect physique and could care less. My blood tests come back clean. That's what I want for them, nothing else.\n\nSo when I say \"eliminate food\", I am saying eat less and not more.", "I\u2019m actually going to go with YTA because I think it\u2019s extremely petty and silly that you\u2019re distancing yourself from somebody for THEIR bad food choices. You\u2019re essentially saying I don\u2019t want to be around you because you\u2019re fat and eat like a fat person and I can\u2019t watch you be fat and eat non healthy food. What they shovel into their mouths has fuck all to do with you tbh. Nobody\u2019s telling you to the eat the crap they do. If you\u2019re going out to eat, there is always a health alternative(s) on the menu or if you\u2019re saying fuck it, let\u2019s get a burger and chips, don\u2019t eat it all and portion control yourself? I\u2019ve literally never looked at someone\u2019s food and got so disgusted I was like I can\u2019t eat with you again because that isn\u2019t healthy food. Super weird", "YTA. Her meals really don't sound that unhealthy. I have fat friends. I love them and want them to live long, happy lives. What they eat is THEIR choice. It would not occur to me to try to nag them into eating what I think they should eat.\n\nYou probably should have just told her not to get her polyps removed. My dad lost a lot of weight near the end. /S", "NTA. You have lived through the struggles of obesity and fought through it. Now, your family\u2019s lives are on the line because they won\u2019t do anything about it. It makes total sense that you don\u2019t want to watch them do that to themselves. It\u2019s like watching someone smoke 3 packs a day and not wanting to be around them. Makes total sense.", "NTA\n\nYou tried to help op but everyone reaches their breaking point eventually", "And if 10 years from now (god forbid) your mom drops dead of a massive coronary, or your sister dies of cancer, will you feel good about hardly having spent any time with them in the last decade? All the invitations you turn down are memories you\u2019ll never make and won\u2019t have to comfort you when these people you \u201clove dearly\u201d are gone. YTA - to them and to yourself.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nJust tell your sister you love them way too much to be able to handle watching them killing themself with food. \n\nBc in the end its no difference to watch someone kill themselfs with booze.", "Just want to add (medical professional here), someone having a cancer scare especially of the colon has fuck all to do with their diet. Your sister eating veggies in sauce or chicken in sauce isn\u2019t going to give her cancer. Colon cancer can happen to anyone - even the fittest, most nutritionally balanced person alive. You seem to have a very warped, disordered view of food and health. I don\u2019t mean this sarcastically or with malice but please speak to a therapist or support professional because your views on it aren\u2019t healthy either"]}
