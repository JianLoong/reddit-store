I feel like the whole slur thing is really an American thing, and it sort of frustrates me because it's the exact translation for a word that in my country is a HUGE part of the culture, and is not at all considered a slur, even though 99% of its usage doesn't actually refer to the Romani people. It's the name given to the style of a lot of the traditional music, dance, culture, heritage, etc, yet the word in English is now a slur, so it sort of feels like erasure of *my* culture now that I'm not allowed to use it. I basically just use the word in my country's language now even when speaking in English, but literally just a couple of weeks ago I had an American friend try to tell me that the word *in my language* was a slur when they realized what it meant, *even with* the explanation of its usage and history in my country & language. They recently *visited my country* and I was telling them about the (quite well known, btw) traditional music, and they told me *I* was wrong and my entire culture is problematic for going by its label- which, by the way, has been in use since before the US was a twinkle in a Founding Father's eye. It really angers me that Americans couldn't just keep their racism in check enough to let my cultural heritage keep its name. And that they can't comprehend that America's history with racism is not *the world's* history with racism. What, exactly, am I supposed to use for the term for my culture? It's just not allowed its own name anymore, even in its own language, because Americans decided they're uncomfortable with it?\n\nLook, I'm from a country in Europe, and Europe's history with its treatment of nomadic Romani is absolutely problematic. That said, in my country - and many others with said problematic history - there actually *are* \"nomadic\" peoples who actually go by the term in its more traditional sense, proudly, like you said. Not all of them are Romani, and not all Romani use the term (because it isn't actually a 1 to 1 translation! Stop equating them!) It's a slightly different application than its usage in the larger cultural heritage style it also refers to in my country, but it still isn't a slur, or insult. To me, it's WAY more racist to equate all people among a specific cultural group to a single national provenance, or national ethnic heritage. That's not how culture works, and turning a culture's name into a slur is just indicative of the fact that you view a people's culture as \"lesser than\" or problematic. If American-Romanis want to go by \"Romani\", that's fine! Go by Romani! That's a word for your national ethnic heritage, *not* necessarily your culture. But don't tell people of the culture that they aren't allowed to use the term proudly. I'm not Romani, but my heritage *is* of the culture that goes by the \"slur\". I now live in the US, but I'm not allowed to say the word for my own culture here. I mean, F that nonsense. MY CULTURE IS NOT A SLUR. Sorry it offends you, but I'm quite proud of it. Should I not be? This whole comment was exhausting to write because I can't even name the cultural label my family wears proudly in English. Is that NOT ridiculous?\n\n((For anyone still reading who's wondering & hasn't figured it out, the word I'm referring to is \"Gitano.\" Gitano music, dance, heritage is a thing of national pride in Spain. Flamenco is a type of Gitano music & dance, and half the words in Flamenco are some variation of the so-called slur because it's practically all we sing about. Being gitanillos. Literally. You'd think after hundreds of years we'd find something else to add into the mix, but hey, like I said... point of national pride & identity. But for any pearl-clutchers reading, the next time you hear Spanish music in the U.S., cover your ears! Don't enjoy it! You're dancing to slurs!!))\n\nAyayay. Anyway, I'm just waiting for Americans to come up with a new word that Gitano can be translated into so I don't have to dance around their weirdness. It literally has only one word it translates into in English. Pop it into Google, you'll see. Or, ya know, they could stop being weird about their concepts of culture and race somehow existing as a one-to-one categorization. Cultural terms don't become slurs when you stop treating them as an ethnic label.", "I'm not related to romani travellers, and the travelling community I am related to is quite closely knit so i don't want to mention it online (i am related by blood so this isnt like a friend of a third cousin situation lol), but the romani travellers i've met have mixed feelings on the word. I've heard that they're fine with calling themselves it, and call other travellers it, but have mixed feelings on outsiders calling them it. Most i know don't love it, but don't love traveller either as that puts them with irish/russian/show travellers and isn't as specific. Honestly, most travellers/related people who aren't romani, like me, don't use it but don't correct people because it's too much of a hassle. most conversations are just like,\n\n\"My family are travellers\"\n\n\"Huh? Travellers? You mean G*psies!\"\n\nIt just becomes too much effort to correct people, so pretty much everyone i know just sighs and goes \"yeah, totally, uh huh\"\n\nHonestly, just steer clear of g*\\ppo and p*\\key at all costs, and nobody is going to mind as long as you do your best and don't call individual travellers it who hate it. But g*psy as a name is pretty bad if you have no connection to the culture.", "Huh, I\u2019m Australian and it only cost me around $120 for a full name change, first middle and last. Though, it could be because of your state/territory. I\u2019m in Victoria, for reference.", "That's exactly where my mind went too. I didn't know there was a famous stripper named Gypsy Rose and now can't help but wonder if the younger Gypsy Rose's mom named her after a stripper.", "There's a show (The Act) and a documentary (Mommy Dead and Dearest) that are both really good if anyone is interested", "Only to certain areas of America. It British English, it's a class thing. Uppity is about the lower class maids getting ideas above their station when they talk back to the Lord and Lady of the house, or their esteemed guests. I can understand how it's turned into a race thing in America because class is intertwined with race, but the whole world is not america, and neither is the internet.", "It\u2019s absolutely something they should acknowledge and not be fighting you about. \n\nJust because things were socially \u201cacceptable\u201d/society was ignorant 20yrs ago (or however old you are) doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t do better now.", "Censoring words like this is so dumb. Hes acting what the word is, not playing a puzzle. Is it Gypsy, Gopsy, Gapsy? Jeez grow up and just say the word.", "I remember that character saying \"I'm Gypsy by name not by nature\". It's all I can remember about her.", "Pretty sure they talk about this on my favorite murder and that she was named after the stripper.", "Nope. Just their pictures gave me the willies. They look trashy. *shudder*", "Fair enough. I was in America, speaking to an American, at the time of the mentioned correction. Never said anyone had to stop using it, just that like many words, it carries a certain history in one culture that it may not carry in others. \n\nFor example: Fanny. In the US it refers to the buttocks. In the UK, it refers to female genitalia. Both are equally goofy.", "I always thought it referred to someone more middle/upper class that were very high and mighty, arrogant or snobby. That they thought they were better than the working class.", "The word existed in England before there even was a South.", "Oh don\u2019t worry! Mine is from Days of Our Lives! /s\n\nIt took 26 years for my mother to actually tell me the truth.\n\nETA- NTA. I have since changed my birth name for that and other reasons and it was quite simple. I\u2019m in QLD. Hardest part was updating it with all the government services.", "I'm not a southerner and I had no idea that term is used racistly at all!! Though I hear it all the time up here in the north. Usually to describe toddlers or snarky people.\n\nGuess I'll stop saying it, just in cass.", "Wait, so does that mean I have to stop using jury-rigged because it sounds so close to j-e-r-r-y-rigged?", "Seen far too many golliwogs for sale around Australia. Even as a kid I knew they were bad. To still see them around decades later is so disgusting. Latest sighting was only last year in a handmade/crafty type shop.", "\ud83e\udd23 I know only two Australians personally, they\u2019re both named Kylie", "I sit corrected! Thank you!", "I\u2019ve changed my last name twice. First time I was 12, second I was in my early 20\u2019s. It cost $180 the last time which was a few years ago. I changed it on my birth certificate, so it now has a section down the bottom saying something like \u201calso known as blah blah\u201d. When it came to changing it as an adult, I don\u2019t recall it costing me anything to change it on things like the ATO, bank, drivers license, utilities, etc. Most I just needed the birth certificate to show proof of change and then from there the new ID like bank card & drivers license were enough for everything else.\n\nI know my Mum has had to keep her married name on the mortgage as it\u2019ll cost her money to change it back to her maiden name.\n\nWe\u2019re on the border, so these changes have occurred in both QLD & NSW.", "Oh, not corrected, really! Just thought it was interesting. And of course, you\u2019re right that \u201cjerry\u201d comes across differently after WWII!"]}
