I feel like the whole slur thing is really an American thing, and it sort of frustrates me because it's the exact translation for a word that in my country is a HUGE part of the culture, and is not at all considered a slur, even though 99% of its usage doesn't actually refer to the Romani people. It's the name given to the style of a lot of the traditional music, dance, culture, heritage, etc, yet the word in English is now a slur, so it sort of feels like erasure of *my* culture now that I'm not allowed to use it. I basically just use the word in my country's language now even when speaking in English, but literally just a couple of weeks ago I had an American friend try to tell me that the word *in my language* was a slur when they realized what it meant, *even with* the explanation of its usage and history in my country & language. They recently *visited my country* and I was telling them about the (quite well known, btw) traditional music, and they told me *I* was wrong and my entire culture is problematic for going by its label- which, by the way, has been in use since before the US was a twinkle in a Founding Father's eye. It really angers me that Americans couldn't just keep their racism in check enough to let my cultural heritage keep its name. And that they can't comprehend that America's history with racism is not *the world's* history with racism. What, exactly, am I supposed to use for the term for my culture? It's just not allowed its own name anymore, even in its own language, because Americans decided they're uncomfortable with it?\n\nLook, I'm from a country in Europe, and Europe's history with its treatment of nomadic Romani is absolutely problematic. That said, in my country - and many others with said problematic history - there actually *are* \"nomadic\" peoples who actually go by the term in its more traditional sense, proudly, like you said. Not all of them are Romani, and not all Romani use the term (because it isn't actually a 1 to 1 translation! Stop equating them!) It's a slightly different application than its usage in the larger cultural heritage style it also refers to in my country, but it still isn't a slur, or insult. To me, it's WAY more racist to equate all people among a specific cultural group to a single national provenance, or national ethnic heritage. That's not how culture works, and turning a culture's name into a slur is just indicative of the fact that you view a people's culture as \"lesser than\" or problematic. If American-Romanis want to go by \"Romani\", that's fine! Go by Romani! That's a word for your national ethnic heritage, *not* necessarily your culture. But don't tell people of the culture that they aren't allowed to use the term proudly. I'm not Romani, but my heritage *is* of the culture that goes by the \"slur\". I now live in the US, but I'm not allowed to say the word for my own culture here. I mean, F that nonsense. MY CULTURE IS NOT A SLUR. Sorry it offends you, but I'm quite proud of it. Should I not be? This whole comment was exhausting to write because I can't even name the cultural label my family wears proudly in English. Is that NOT ridiculous?\n\n((For anyone still reading who's wondering & hasn't figured it out, the word I'm referring to is \"Gitano.\" Gitano music, dance, heritage is a thing of national pride in Spain. Flamenco is a type of Gitano music & dance, and half the words in Flamenco are some variation of the so-called slur because it's practically all we sing about. Being gitanillos. Literally. You'd think after hundreds of years we'd find something else to add into the mix, but hey, like I said... point of national pride & identity. But for any pearl-clutchers reading, the next time you hear Spanish music in the U.S., cover your ears! Don't enjoy it! You're dancing to slurs!!))\n\nAyayay.
