Good luck to you!", "I have a feeling that the parents were forcing them to go to one of those super-religious, super-controlling colleges. I would have run away too, and the fact that they lied until it was time to go was simple self-preservation.", "**OP's post with fixed formatting:**\n\nI recently moved out of my parent\u2019s house in the middle of the night.

AITA?", "NTA.\n\nYou are 18, this is not running away. This is moving out. They cannot do anything. \n(Not saying it isnt serious and all. But they have no legal basis on forcing you to come back). \n\nNow, is your bank-account your own or your parents? \n\nFor the leaving in the night part i cannot judge since information is missing. I just suspect you have your reasons.\n\nEdit: not sure about the lying-to-them-about-college part. It could be an ah-move on your part, or ypur parents are so unbearable that you simply couldnt handle this otherwise.", "Kid you\u2019re 18. That\u2019s legal and you just moved out in the eyes of the law. NTA", "NTA. Parents controlling their kids every move will never work.  I don't do that with my kids.  You let them make their own decisions and learn for themselves.  Good for you for getting away from that. Hopefully down the road your relationship with your parents will be better.", "NTA. If your parents are as controling as you make them sound, it seems like you did what to had to do to be able to live your own life. Trying to force you to go to the college they want you to go to and draining your bank account paints them in a pretty bad light.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't run away; you escaped an abusive situation.\n\nDon't look back and don't be afraid to block your parents on everything if they continue to harass you\n\nGood luck!", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult now and decided to live under your own terms. Your parents were not willing to consider your \"input\" on the life they had planned for you. When you did so they didn't show concern or distress over your unexplained absence but over their lack of control.\n\nMistakes you will definitely make over time. Everyone does. But they'll be yours, stemming from your decisions, in the pursuit of your dreams. And this isn't one.\n\nI've got a friend who always butted heads with her family because everyone knew better regarding how she should lead her life. It took her moving a good distance away (not as drastic or sudden as your situation) before they came to the realization that they needed to treat her with more respect if they wanted visits.", "NTA. Fuck them, your parents will wonder when you never come to visit them. Do your own thing don\u2019t let them control you, you are an adult.", "NTA\n\nYou're 18, you can't \"run away\" at that age, it's called moving\n\nYou are an AH for lying to them about attending though.", "Overall NTA however you did seem to do a lot of ill thought out things, like:\n\nTaking a car not legally owned by you, if you paid for it or part of then also not getting it in your name.\n\nLeaving in the middle night.\n\nAgreeing to go to College when you never planned on doing so, which either will cost you or your parents money, which makes me think this is why they would ask for the car back and take money out of your account.\n\nHonestly a lot of this swings in the balance as it could read as your parents are way to strict and may even be abusive but it also reads as your a niaive child and annoyed that your parents don't let you do anything you want or something in the middle.", "I feel I can't make a judgement without more info. \nI think unless there's a safety aspect at play here, lying and moving out in the middle of the night is kinda an AH move; however, the taking money from your bank account smacks of abuse (and also I am incredibly curious as to how they have access to your bank account to do that?)", "NTA for moving out; but had they already paid tuition? I\u2019m not sure why you didn\u2019t say you weren\u2019t going. There\u2019s missing info; I don\u2019t know if you felt unsafe.", "NTA for moving out.\n\nYou really could have handled this a lot better. \n\nPretending you were going to go was a mistake. Moving out in the middle of the night seems unnecessary. They're clearly overbearing but I still think you could have told them. \n\nI think your family taking your money and demanding the car back made them the real AHs here. You really should have made sure you had an account your parents couldn't access.", "Nta. You are an adult. Your family is abusing you. Do not let them. Leave. You aren't running away. You are separating from an abusive situation. Guess what? Your abusers will fight this tooth and nail. Because losing control makes abusers crazy.", "OP was that money in your own account or a shared account? Was it money you earned from your job? Because if it is, they stole that $ from you, and you need to file a police report to get it back. Assuming you want to, though. I can believe that you may be tired enough of them to let it go and move on.\n\nRegardless, tomorrow you need to go open a new account at a new bank. That way, your parents can not get a hold of any more of your funds. They seem like the type to try anything to force you back home.\n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA\u2026you're 18 and they have no right to take money from your account but are on it as co-owners since you were a minor before. Establish a new account and move your money\u2026and I would use a different bank as well so they don't know where it is and can't go in with some BS sob story to the teller and get access.", "NTA. You probably need somewhere else to live, where they can't get you. You may be eligible for some form of public assistance, and possibly could get legal advice on your rights from social services. Protect yourself.", "The strict parents who stole ops money and then threatened to call the cops on? For sure they are some religious nuts. I immediately assumed this was some Liberty University indoctrination.", "A real hero", "Just for future reference, the formatting problem is caused by indenting the start of a paragraph. Reddit uses that to indicate programming code and puts it into a fixed width font with no line wrapping.", "Lying to abusers is not ah behavior. Its survival. Op is being abused. Do not suggest honesty with the abusers. They don't deserve it.", "Not the AH for running away but definitely for stealing a car that isn\u2019t in their name, letting their parents put down deposits and whatnot for a college he never intended on going to instead of just saying \u201cim moving out at 18 and wont be your problem\u201d. Parents are AH for taking money from the account for sure, but also if you\u2019re planning to move out in the night from parents you describe as shitty, maybe moving money into a solo account should have crossed your mind. Also no specifics as to what makes the school or parents so bad before this moment so cant really say they\u2019ve been abusers their whole life. Seems like a kid who was told an option for their future and repeatedly said yes yes yes and then once it got close they realized they never actually gave the future any thought and panicked.", "Reddit often tells underage teens to lay low until they're 18. If OP had to lie about attending a certain college in the future, they were just protecting themselves and laying low until they could get out.", "Nope. Lying to abusers is a survival tactic. Being honest with abusers gives them a tactical advantage they do not deserve. They stole from op. They deserve nothing. Lie all you like to save yourself op. Whatever it takes to get the hell away from those people, do it.", "Yes the child in a household that probably forced them to lie for a reason until they turned 18 is the asshole not the parents /s", "Because so many teen ages run away from home in the middle of the night because they are mildly annoyed. Pub leeze. Kids are suffering abuse, just like op, and they need help. Ops parents stole all their money. That's abuse.", "The account was likely first opened before OP turned 18. Minors need an adult/guardian name on the account. It could have been linked to their accounts so easy peasy to transfer the funds out. OP should have moved the money once they turned 18 (to different bank in their name only), but I could see them not knowing, or being concerned that doing that would tip their hand before they were ready to move. NTA", "Op is being abused. Financially and emotionally. Those parents stole that money. I know too many 18 year olds whose parents are still dipping their grimy paws in their children's bank accounts. It's sick and abusive. It's not their money. They stole ops money in an effort to manipulate and control.", "You are blaming an 18 year old for being financially abused by his parents. How can an 18 yo who has been controlled learn how to be independent? The first attempt is met with stealng and a threat to call the cops because of the car. It's not Op's fault that the parents are abusive assholes.", "I'm not blaming anyone of anything, except the parents for stealing money.", "Telling op he should have gotten his financials in order is ridiculous. He's 18 and has obviously been living with control freaks all his life. When was he supposed to learn about his banking options?", "There was no way to know. \n\nI'm observing that a mistake was made. This is not intended as a criticism. You're just reading it as one.", "Fair enough."]}
