We had arranged to meet at the mall at 2:30pm to go shopping for some work clothes for my friends new job. \n\nI arrive at the mall at 2pm and meet my friend who I\u2019ll call \u201cAnna\u201d outside. As we head inside Anna tells me she is starving and wants to go to eat at the Applebees inside the mall before we go shopping. \n\nI agree but tell Anna I had already eaten lunch so I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to eat anything. We get seated in the restaurant immediately and I order a drink with Anna. We look over the menu and I tell Anna that I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m not hungry and I won\u2019t be able to order anything. \n\nAnna starts getting incredibly angry at me saying I\u2019m causing her massive anxiety and making her feel awkward forcing her to eat by herself. I tell her I\u2019m really sorry and feel bad, but I\u2019m not hungry and don\u2019t want to waste money and food when I won\u2019t be able to eat it (I have some medical issues which cause me to have decreased appetite/nausea so I struggle to eat my meals and can\u2019t usually eat outside of my meal times). \n\nI told Anna I had already eaten lunch since we hadn\u2019t planned on having lunch beforehand. I also assumed she would have already had lunch since 2:30pm isn\u2019t a typical time for lunch. \n\nAnna gets pissed, says she doesn\u2019t want to eat or go shopping anymore, and storms out of the restaurant. \n\nI feel awful about what happened. I guess Anna told our other friend and they are mad at me as well. Am I really an asshole in this situation?", "created_utc": 1674780896, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m7sgb/aita_for_not_eating_lunch_with_my_friend/", "score": 110, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA. What a strange thing for not one, but TWO, \u201cfriends\u201d to be upset over. \n\nI keep trying to think of something here that would make sense, but seriously.. why would you eat when you\u2019re not hungry, and why demand someone eat food at the same time as you, on a whim nonetheless. Just, wow. No loss here OP", "NTA\n\n2:30 is really late for lunch. If she wanted to meet for lunch, she should have told you and planned a better time.", "NTA. Lunch was not in the plan anyway.", "NTA You sure she's 22 and not 5? She wasn't eating alone because you were there with her and you shouldn't be forced to eat something. This is super childish behavior,  a grown woman shouldn't be throwing a temper tantrum because you just weren't hungry", "NTA\nSounds like she might have just been a little hangry.", "NTA. You don't need to force yourself to eat a second lunch you don't want just to cater to her weird hang-up about eating solo. You were even sitting there with her. Ridiculous!", "NTA sounds like she was cranky from hunger and needs to check herself. Her getting anxious is not on you. She needs to learn how to cope in a healthy way", "NTA lunch wasn't in the plans and she acted unreasonably", "NTA. You need new friends. Seriously, this is childish behavior.", "NTA. If you had planned to eat lunch and ate without her I could see her being upset. But the fact that you were meeting to shop (not to eat) means you have absolutely no fault here. \n\nI also struggle to eat due to nausea. If I ate and ate again we'd never get to shopping because I'd be throwing up. So I feel you there too! You even got a drink. Sorry it turned out so bad!", "NTA. It's usually pretty common to eat lunch before meeting up with friends, especially so late in the day (unless lunch plans were organised, but in this case they were not).", "NTA.\n\nIf your friend wanted to get lunch before shopping it should have been communicated *prior* to getting together, especially when your plans were outside of the typical lunch hours. Throwing a tantrum and involving your other friend is incredibly childish.", "NTA lunch was never in the plans and you even offered to sit and have a drink with her.", "NTA.  She wasn't \"by herself\" if you were still there with her having something to drink.  If she has that much anxiety about eating when other people aren't she needs to see a therapist.", "NTA she could have grabbed something quick at the food court or on her way. Springing a sit down lunch on you before shopping was so rude!", "NTA: At 2:30 I'm already planning dinner not thinking maybe it's lunch time. If she wanted to do lunch then she should have told you about that beforehand.", "NTA. It\u2019s the middle of the afternoon. Lunch is 12-1. That\u2019s on her for not eating first. It\u2019s also on her for not being able to be the only one eating that\u2019s just weird.", "NTA. No reason to feel awful. Your friend is either having a rough day, but more likely it\u2019s more like others are saying. Very immature friends.", "NTA. People don't have to eat if they don't want to", "It is awkward to eat while the person you\u2019re with isn\u2019t eating. That\u2019s fair. but if lunch was never mentioned in y\u2019alls plans, she has no right getting angry at you for that. Very unfair of her to react like that.\n\nNTA", "NTA.  \n\nLunch was not part of the plan. She cannot expect you to eat when you are not hungry.", "You should never be forced to do something you don't want to. You didn't want to eat. NTA", "NTA. \n\nAnna freaked out and is turning your friend against you because you made her feel awkward?? That\u2019s an intense reaction. Imagine what she\u2019ll do if she feels an emotion worse than awkward. \n\nAlso, getting angry and storming out of a restaurant is way more awkward than being the only one eating. Which isn\u2019t even awkward. Your ex-friend should be embarrassed.", "Definitely NTA. Sounds like Anna was gaslighting you big time. You don\u2019t have to let her issues become your issues, and she should have simply respected your choices as your own.", "I'm just wondering what thought process that woman went through to have a tantrum over having to eat alone? Does she have to eat every meal with someone else nearby or gets anxiety? Does she blow up like this at every little thing that doesn't go her way?\n\nDon't feel bad about it OP. Her acting like a child is her loss, not yours. NTA", "NTA.", "NTA. You literally went in and sat with her at an unplanned lunch. It\u2019s not like you refused to go in and forbid her to eat.

So, OP should waste money, force herself to eat and probably be nauseous or throw up (OP mentioned on her post about eating problems) just because of \"proper etiquette\" when it wasn't even discussed in the first place? Why this would be that grave of a mistake to warrant throwing a tantrum?\n\nAlso, it's really \"pretty fucking common\" to have lunch at home and go shopping afterwards.
