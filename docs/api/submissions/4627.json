Given this context, I can appreciate why OP is confused.  Or has godparenthood now generally morphed into a \"special aunt/uncle\" kind of thing?  NTA.", "NTA/NAH\n\nI get you are not comfortable with it and you have every right to refuse.\nBut it really goes down to *how seriously* your friend take his faith.\nHe could very easily mean this offeras a sign of affection/respect \n\nI am an atheist right now but I was raised as Catholic by people who were not that radical. \nAs example my brother godparents are a couple of family friends we see less than once a year and he has never discussed faith with.\n\nIt still requires you to be baptised and have received the other sacraments tough. \n**So - if you're an atheist - either he is trying to convert you or he doesn't take his faith seriously at all**", "Communication is the key. What does the new father expect you to do in reality? Is it really about religion? Or just adding one more Uncle to the family? I am godmother to a small girl (me and mum are really good friends since 20 years). Not many relatives around. Religion isn't even an important part in the family. It's more like one person more for the child, more gifts and play days. I want to be a part in their lives and spoil her :) I love being the cool auntie", "NTA. You're taking it more seriously than he is. I was raised Catholic and I am a godmother. Now technically I am supposed to guide my godson spiritually however my cousin and I don't take religion too seriously. She told me she picked me because I am spiritual without the dogma that comes with religion. You being an atheist do not fit the bill for this position. Imagine if the priest found out lol. I find it odd he would ask you to participate in something you don't believe in.", "This has to be fake. In order to be a godparent in the Catholic Church you need to be a member of the Church.

Parents must specify in a legal document, which isn't religious at all, who will be their children's guardian in the event of their death.  If no such legal document exists, the legal authorities will ask the extended family first and if family doesn't step up, the kids go to foster care.  A godfather or godmother will have no claim.\n\nAs far as the religious stuff, most people don't bother with it at all.  The reality is that its a honorary position where your friend hopes that you create a special \"big brother\" or \"big sister\" relationship with their child.\n\nTalk to your friend and learn more about what they expect, then decide.", "Nta", "It's too late now, but I've seen the tradition adapted as Guide Father/Mother - filling that role but not in a religious capacity, being the other adult the child knows they can turn to for advice, etc.", "NTA.", "NTA But normally, in the Catholic Church, the person needs to be baptized and confirmed to be eligible to be a godparent. Sometimes you can get away with just the baptism, but the purpose of being a godparent in the Catholic church is to be the religious guide of the child. \n\nSo you can be a Godfather \"not officially\". But if it entails a ceremony in the church you are probably not even eligible.", "NTA\n\n>I'm not fit to lead anyone through a religion I don't believe in.\n\nNeither would I be.\n\nI don't understand why your friend thinks that's a good idea. You could tell him that yes, you will raise his child if needed, but if he wanted the child to be raised with religion, he needs to pick someone else.\n\nRespect for others religion or lack thereof goes both ways.", "NTA \n\nI was asked to be a Godmother to a friend's child.  Same as you I am not religious so I said thanks but no, but that I would always be there to support the child with anything I could.  Friend (in all the years we knew each other the only time to she went to church was a couple of times in the run up to her wedding) decided that she wanted nothing to do with me after that.  \n\nWhen I have been in Court testifying I have refused to swear on the Bible as it means nothing to me, whereas she would rather make all sorts of vows and promises in a church she does not believe in unless it is for a showy occasion.", "NAH\n\nYou're taking this commitment seriously. That's a great thing to do. Saying \"no\" to it because you disagree with ideology and don't know if you'll change is a mature thing to do. Jerry is not an asshole either because even though he was taken aback by it, this is mostly a first reaction. Give him time to process it.", "NTA. And if the priest knew I doubt he'd let you be the godfather. Catholics are very serious about this kind of thing.", "I'd ask your friend what role he imagines you playing in his child's life. We are religious and asked both religious friends and non-religious relatives to be godparents, because we wanted out children to have adults who loved them and cared for them, and who they could go to if/when they didn't feel they could come to us at any point in life, and we value all of them and respect their opinions and their input. \n\nAnd the people who will look after our children in the untimely event of our death are not even official 'god parents' but they know who they are and why we have asked them to do that role for us. \n\nBut you won't know what your friend wants of you, and whether you are ok and up for filling that role, until you ask.", "NTA.

Tell him you are inpressed, because you thought he would want to have his kid guided to HIS way of understanding religion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHE is a major AH. He thinks HIs religion is superior to your approach to religion.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo tell him if he really wants you to be the godparent you will do it, but you will not lie to the kid and guide him to relegious freedom and to making his own choices, NOT into dogmatically taking on his parents religion.", "In the catholic church, you aren't actually allowed to participate in the baptism as a godparent unless you are an active, practicing catholic. \n\nI mean, most of us take liberties with what \"active\" and \"practicing\" means when a friend asks us to do this, but the church usually wants the godfather's baptism and confirmation records etc. to make sure they are catholic. .\n\nOP is NTA, and is probably refusing to do something that the church wouldn't have allowed him to do anyway, for all the same reasons.", "Absolutely this OP.  My godmother converted to Judaism and was never expected to keep up with my religious guidance (Catholic). My parents gave up on my religious guidance when I was young as well but basically found my own path back to the Catholic Church. \n\nI don\u2019t think your friend truly expects you to help with the religious guidance if he knows you\u2019re an atheist.  I think he would like you to take on the more important roll of raising their child should anything happen to him and his wife.  Yes according to Catholic doctrine that includes religious guidance but what guidance can you actually provide if you aren\u2019t familiar with Catholicism?  \n\nAlso with regards to the baptism, depending on the church and how strict they are, he probably had to get permission from his priest.", "It seems to me that some people take it more seriously than others (both on the side of being the godparent AND naming the godparent). I know plenty of people who were raised Catholic and still go through some motions for big things (like weddings, baptisms, funerals) but don\u2019t go to mass except for maybe Christmas and Easter. Of course idk where OPs friend is on this. \n\nMy dad has a goddaughter - at the time he was living out of state and in the military, so he wasn\u2019t very involved nor expected to be. He was raised Catholic, so he was baptized and confirmed but he never cared for it so was no longer practicing when this happened either. He\u2019s really just the godfather because baby\u2019s dad and him were best friends at the time. I\u2019ve never even met her lol. \n\nI still don\u2019t blame OP for turning it down, but I\u2019m speculating that friend is surprised and hurt because he wasn\u2019t really expecting much from OP in terms of religious upbringing. He probably just wanted to give OP a special spot in his child\u2019s life. Hopefully he comes around and sees OPs pov, and finds someone else who is more comfortable being named a godparent.", "Being a member of the church only means you've been baptized.\n\nI was baptized but have identified as atheist for years now.\n\nOP is saying no from an ethical standpoint. Not a technical one.", "The godfather of one of my sister is not religious at all. He was asked so he did it but he\u2019s not Christian.\nSo it is possible technically.\n\nBut I understand why OP doesn\u2019t want to", "This is true, but there is a provision in canon law that one godparent CAN be nonCatholic as long as the other one is (I *think* the nonCatholic godparent has to be Christian, tho).  The official name is \u201cChristian witness\u201d, IIRC, but it\u2019s easier to just substitute \u201cgodparent\u201d.  They do have to commit to supporting raising the child as a Catholic, as well.\n\nSource:  my youngest child has her namesake (my best friend) as her nonCatholic \u201cgodmother\u201d.", "I'm not an expert in Catholicism by any means, but I believe they only need at least one godparent to be Catholic. I believe my (non Catholic) BIL is the godparent to a child baptized Catholic. I recall the discussion about them needing another godparent tho, because they needed a Catholic one too.", "Not true for all Catholic Churches. I am not Catholic, and was allowed to be a godparent in the Catholic Church. The parents just had to have the other god parent be Catholic.", "I think you're skipping a bunch of steps. None of your comments on the religion part are relevant if they actually mean godfather as part of baptism. They make vows, etc. during that process that would be completely disrespectful to the religion for an Atheist to make, because they would be lies. I would never be able to truthfully promise to nurture my nieces and nephews growth in the Catholic religion. I can nurture their curiosity towards religion, but I would never push them towards one specific religion.", "When you become a godparent in the Catholic Church, you vow that you believe in God and that you will help raise the child in the faith. I was made godmother to one of my cousins when I was 20. I am no longer a believer, and that has been brought up as a disappointment by relatives in the past because I took those vows. A friend asked me to be godmother to her son several years ago and I declined because I could not in good conscience lie about being a non-believer. Just because it\u2019s not a legal claim or rarely discussed doesn\u2019t mean that people should be okay with lying about it. OP, you are NTA. You took a principled stance.", "You aren\u2019t a full member until confirmation. But even then what I was meaning is you need to be a member in good standing. You need a home church, to go to mass regularly, etc.", "Right but the church won't allow an atheist to be a godparent. There's literal religious classes the godparent must attend.", "Okay but the Catholic Church is different.  My SO is no longer a member of his church because he had sex and a child out of wedlock.  He accepts this but did petition his priest to allow his son to be baptized.  His son is member because the \u201cfathers sins shouldn\u2019t be assigned to the child.\u201d", "True, but they don't check anymore. Probably because they're wouldn't be enough people.", "I can assure you many churches / priests do not check that.\n\nI got married in a church, as an atheist. Hadn't been to church in years.", "In many churches they don't check that or care nowadays. My cousin is only baptized and his wife isn't even baptized and they are godparents.", "The only way a church will know if you're an atheist is if you tell them so.\n\nAnd there are not 'godparent classes' where I'm from.\n\nI know because all three of my kids have been baptized.", "That priest sounds like a fucking asshole.\n\nHe sounds just like the one who asked me how many times I've masturbated during a confession.\n\nPeople like this are the some of reason why I turned away from the church.", "This is exactly why.\n\nIt makes sense to be more lenient given the reduction in the church's numbers as of the past few years. It would be unsustainable otherwise.", "That\u2019s marriage, not baptism. The rules are different for marriage.", "You're right, I was thinking about sponsors at confirmation", "How is the priest an asshole for following the doctrine of his faith?  Also how is he an asshole for agreeing with my SO because it was that important to him to petition the church?  I think that\u2019s pretty damn compassionate.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong priests can be assholes, and I have found that churches outside my country of origin  (US) are not nearly as stupid.", "That may be but I'm telling you many churches do not actually check.\n\nI have several friends and family members who they themselves do not attend mass, nor do they have a 'home church'. They (along with the non-churchgoing godparents) all baptized their children.", "Ya that's different lol.\n\nI was my sisters sponsor.\n\nNow I'm an atheist and she's agnostic. \n\nIronically all 6 of our kids are baptized.", "I can\u2019t say whether churches check or not, but the only requirement for a Catholic to be a godparent is to be confirmed.  Regular mass attendance is not required.", "I'm a cradle catholic turned atheist. I would accept the god parent role, and just hope their religious teaching never came down to me.", "Why accept the role though?\n\nGenuinely curious \n\nI am the same as you but I would not accept for that reason.", "Because their religion literally means nothing to me, and apparently to the parent, in this situation. The parent seems to see it as a symbolic role, so I'd take it as such.", "That's the way it is for so many godparents nowadays.\n\nIt's become more of a formality to have another couple present for a baptism.\n\nMy brother (an outspoken atheist) baptized his son last summer. He did so under protest. \n\nHis girlfriend wanted to do it because 'tradition' and to (I kid you not) 'see him in his little tux'.\n\nThe date happened to coincide with an out of country wedding I was attending. When I told my brother I wouldn't be attending he said 'good thing I didn't ask you to be the godfather'.\n\nI kinda chuckled and said 'not to worry, I would have said no anyway'."]}
