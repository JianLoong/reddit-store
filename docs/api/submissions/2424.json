Last year we hosted a huge Thanksgiving dinner at our house and his parents, his sister and her three children came. Her two youngest children were 5 and 2 years old at this time. We had just finished furnishing our house with a brand new sectional, dining table and chairs and a ten piece outdoor furniture set for our deck. During dinner I sat next to my boyfriends mom and sister who was holding the youngest child. I watched as they let the child rub cranberry sauce all over my brand new cream colored dining chairs. They said nothing and did nothing to stop it. My friends who were there said they could see the steam coming out of my ears. It was my first holiday with his family and I didn\u2019t want to lose my temper in front of everyone. So I waited until they left the table and started scrubbing the chairs trying to get the stains out (some of which are still there a year later). They never apologized to me for letting their children trash my house and this wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d done it. They had came over a couple of months before this and smeared melted chocolate all over my cream colored cushions on my brand new outdoor furniture. Again, while their parents sat there and watched. A couple days after Thanksgiving I mentioned all of this to my boyfriend and he agreed that it was rude, but said it was ultimately my decision if I wanted to continue inviting them over. It\u2019s been a year now and I haven\u2019t invited them over since, and his mother has started dropping hints about getting together at our house again but I know if I invite his parents over they\u2019ll want to invite the sister.

It's your home and you should be able to maintain it however you wish. However, I don't know how reasonable it is to completely ban people from your home without them knowing why. After having read the comments, I'm going to go a bit further:\n\n1. **It's your responsibility as a homeowner to make sure that people know the rules of your house.** I've been to houses where people don't want shoes indoors or where they don't allow food/drink in certain areas. Yes, some people might think you're picky, but it's not their home. People often assume that their norm is everyone's norm and they won't know any different unless you tell them. Practice saying things like, \"Oh, I'd prefer the kids didn't eat \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (chocolate, cranberry sauce etc) on the furniture. These chair pads stain easily.\"\n2. **If you are going to have kids in your home, there's going to be a bit of a mess.** It's not reasonable to expect that there will be no mess with a 5 yo and a 2 yo. Plus, some kids are just messier than others. Yes, the degree of messiness can be due to lax parenting (as it sounds is at least partly the case here), but some of it is just the kids themselves. Get chair covers, cover the area they are sitting on with blankets etc. Whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better or to lessen the mess, do it. Another thing you can do to help is to make foods that are less messy.\n3. **Each person in a couple should take point on dealing with their own family members.** Ultimately, your boyfriend should address this with his sister or mom the next time there are hints about you hosting. It can be very simple and non-committal: \"Well, Mom, the last few times the kids have been over, they were allowed to rub food into our furniture, which cost us quite a bit of time to clean. We understand that kids come with some mess, but we also would prefer that they were more closely supervised in our home.\"\n\nIn the end, it's up to you and your boyfriend to come to a consensus about whether or not you will allow his family to visit. However, I hope you can find your voice and speak up, because I can guarantee this won't be the last time something like this comes up and just avoiding the situation all together only works for so long.", "INFO: what is your boyfriend\u2019s opinion on all this?", "NTA\n\nAlso: hopefully you are working on your anxiety and ability to speak up kindly but firmly in these situations. Until you are, BF needs to do the communicating, especially with his family. \n\nIF you have the children over again (or even if there is a complete accident with otherwise-careful guests) just casually say something like \u201cOh I see Little Buford rubbed cranberries into the cushions. Let me get you the fabric cleaner\u201d and then hand them the appropriate cleaning tools and supplies. If it was intentional (like the children, not and adult\u2019s purse knocking over a cup at the edge of the counter for example) AND the stain isn\u2019t budging- then you add something like \u201cOh it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming out.

To account for others not parenting their kids or simply those times when accidents happen, my husband and I prep the house for guests when we know there\u2019s a risk of things getting messy. \nI put away anything fragile (I have a cabinet I toss my glass candles, etc into), put a plastic cover on the wooden dining room table, I actually put scotchgard on my chair fabric (though seat covers also work) and have Resolve ready. If we see things that are obviously going to lead to a mess, we ask the kids nicely if they can avoid doing things (like eating Cheetos in the living room) or create fun rules where they get their own kids table to eat or no one can have drinks in the living room, etc. I do find if I simply ask the kids in a fun friendly way, they are happy to be helpful (mostly; I do have a nephew who doesn\u2019t fit the usual mold, but he will respond to reminders and give me a whining drawn out okay or I negotiate with a reward for following the rules). I even have a few toys around for different kid age groups to keep them entertained with toys, instead of making our home decor their toys. I know it sounds excessive, but unfortunately part of being a part of a large family, I\u2019ve found that not everyone actually parents their children and sometimes accidents truly do happen.  \n\nI wish you and your boyfriend luck!

I don\u2019t understand why all of this is being put on you.", "esp since he's almost a decade older than her..", "I have severe anxiety about conflict and somedays it\u2019s easier to walk away or avoid conflict.", "True.  ESH.", "If your furniture is actively getting damaged during a party you are hosting, and you choose to walk away to avoid conflict, then the damage done is on you.", "You can always buy a giant roll of plastic and cover every surface with it.  And so much fun when they ask why!", "On the same note, why would she want to involve herself with people who need to be mindreaders to know to not let their children destroy furniture?", "That's fair. Everyone is being unreasonable here.", "Your house, your rules and you were also wrong to just sit there and do nothing.  Trying to \"keep the peace\" by keeping quiet is only going to create more problems going forward and becuase of this, ESH", "Info: has his sister ever made comments to you about kids? (when your going to have them, how 'your life will change' etc) Because this screams, to me, like she's trying to teach you a lesson.  Because the kids doing this TWICE to cream colored stuff?", "Go over their place instead. Bring as many new paints and fruits for the kids to smear on their chairs. And maybe even do some yourself. If they say anything just say I thought because you guys always trash my furniture I thought it's ok.", "NTA. I would've said something right then and there. If his sister doesn't stop her kids, then u can. This is ur house.", ">his mother has started dropping hints about getting together at our house again\n\nAre they hosting for you? \n\n>Next week I am hosting thanksgiving again, but only inviting my family.\n\nIt's perfectly fine to just want your family one year. Especially as your boyfriend doesn't seem to want to deal with this and doesn't seem to be cleaning up after them. NTA.", "You are NTA. Maybe, you can all agree to eating at a restaurant. If asked why not your house, maybe say that clean up was just too exhausting last year and Thanksgiving should be more about family and fonder memories.", "NTA, however I would heavily suggest working on how you communicate. This whole situation is a bunch of people avoiding saying the hard thing. \n\nMom + sister didn\u2019t reprimand or apologize for the children\u2019s messes.\n\nYou said nothing, and expect them to know everything when clearly they do not have the same definition of acceptable behavior as you.\n\nIt\u2019s could be as simple as: \u2018Hi sister. As the holidays approach, I wanted to speak with you about something. The past few times bf and I have hosted, your children have damaged or destroyed furniture with food. I fully understand that children make messes, but the fact that it has not been addressed at all is something that has bothered me. While bf and I are happy to host events, we feel it is important that the space is respected. I would love to have a conversation and collaborate on solutions for all.\u2019\n\nBe honest. Or just didn\u2019t invite them to your home. You bf said it\u2019s up to you, but make sure her keeps that same stance under pressure and over time.", "NYA BUT why are you not establishing rules in your own home?  I am sort of a people pleaser, but I expected people to respect my boundaries. I also expected others to set their own boundaries when I visited their home with my children.", "Not a saint.  spineless.", "I can't say a damn thing to my inlaws without them blowing a gasket so I just don't. I don't feel like dealing with the conflict so I get why you kept quiet. That being said my husband says things to them so I don't have to. His sister likes to just start shutting lights off in our house while we're talking when she wants to leave. She's 18...so now I just look at my husband and go \"babe\" and gesture in her direction and let him handle it. Your boyfriend should be doing the same. His family, his monkeys.", "Your boyfriend should open his mouth and deal with his family instead of putting the onus on you. You're NTA.", "Spray hydrogen peroxide on the chocolate and cranberry stains. \n\nIt won\u2019t fade the fabric color, but it will remove the food stains. Also works on blood. \n\nThe more you know!", "In the interest of peace, maybe you could get covers for the sofa and chairs? \n\nYou are NtA, but sometimes easier to prevent the issue. I don't serve cranberry when there are children of young age, but chocolate is tough to avoid.", "If only that was enough to compel some men to support their partners.", "You could probably give the most careful written speech with perfect delivery and the sister will likely be offended. The goal isn\u2019t to make her happy, it\u2019s to stop future destruction of your property. \n\nJust be honest and direct and stick to the facts/actions. \u201cThe children ruined our furniture. We cannot have them over because they were allowed to do so and no effort was made to stop them, clean up, or compensate for damages.\u201d \n\nAnd it doesn\u2019t matter whether this was brand new white furniture, priceless heirloom antiques, or ratty hand-me-down furniture that\u2019s about to go to the dump- their behavior and lack of parental supervision was not OK. \n\nRemember, your feelings matter too.

No problem. NTA.", "Anxiety can be impossible to get past. I have days I can\u2019t get out of bed because it\u2019s so bad.", "> Maybe they don't understand they did something to offend you\n\nI would really hope that these people are aware that people don't like it when you cover their furniture in sticky food.", "Her boyfriend needs to deal with his family. Why does he get to stand back, look innocent, and just watch his girlfriend have a difficult conversation with his parents and his sister?", "And that\u2019s the only place they\u2019re all allowed to sit. They get TV trays."]}
