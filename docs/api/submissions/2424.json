Last year we hosted a huge Thanksgiving dinner at our house and his parents, his sister and her three children came. Her two youngest children were 5 and 2 years old at this time. We had just finished furnishing our house with a brand new sectional, dining table and chairs and a ten piece outdoor furniture set for our deck. During dinner I sat next to my boyfriends mom and sister who was holding the youngest child. I watched as they let the child rub cranberry sauce all over my brand new cream colored dining chairs. They said nothing and did nothing to stop it. My friends who were there said they could see the steam coming out of my ears. It was my first holiday with his family and I didn\u2019t want to lose my temper in front of everyone. So I waited until they left the table and started scrubbing the chairs trying to get the stains out (some of which are still there a year later). They never apologized to me for letting their children trash my house and this wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d done it. They had came over a couple of months before this and smeared melted chocolate all over my cream colored cushions on my brand new outdoor furniture. Again, while their parents sat there and watched. A couple days after Thanksgiving I mentioned all of this to my boyfriend and he agreed that it was rude, but said it was ultimately my decision if I wanted to continue inviting them over. It\u2019s been a year now and I haven\u2019t invited them over since, and his mother has started dropping hints about getting together at our house again but I know if I invite his parents over they\u2019ll want to invite the sister.

It's your home and you should be able to maintain it however you wish. However, I don't know how reasonable it is to completely ban people from your home without them knowing why. After having read the comments, I'm going to go a bit further:\n\n1. **It's your responsibility as a homeowner to make sure that people know the rules of your house.** I've been to houses where people don't want shoes indoors or where they don't allow food/drink in certain areas. Yes, some people might think you're picky, but it's not their home. People often assume that their norm is everyone's norm and they won't know any different unless you tell them. Practice saying things like, \"Oh, I'd prefer the kids didn't eat \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (chocolate, cranberry sauce etc) on the furniture. These chair pads stain easily.\"\n2. **If you are going to have kids in your home, there's going to be a bit of a mess.** It's not reasonable to expect that there will be no mess with a 5 yo and a 2 yo. Plus, some kids are just messier than others. Yes, the degree of messiness can be due to lax parenting (as it sounds is at least partly the case here), but some of it is just the kids themselves. Get chair covers, cover the area they are sitting on with blankets etc. Whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better or to lessen the mess, do it. Another thing you can do to help is to make foods that are less messy.\n3. **Each person in a couple should take point on dealing with their own family members.** Ultimately, your boyfriend should address this with his sister or mom the next time there are hints about you hosting. It can be very simple and non-committal: \"Well, Mom, the last few times the kids have been over, they were allowed to rub food into our furniture, which cost us quite a bit of time to clean. We understand that kids come with some mess, but we also would prefer that they were more closely supervised in our home.\"\n\nIn the end, it's up to you and your boyfriend to come to a consensus about whether or not you will allow his family to visit. However, I hope you can find your voice and speak up, because I can guarantee this won't be the last time something like this comes up and just avoiding the situation all together only works for so long.", "INFO: what is your boyfriend\u2019s opinion on all this?", "NTA\n\nAlso: hopefully you are working on your anxiety and ability to speak up kindly but firmly in these situations. Until you are, BF needs to do the communicating, especially with his family. \n\nIF you have the children over again (or even if there is a complete accident with otherwise-careful guests) just casually say something like \u201cOh I see Little Buford rubbed cranberries into the cushions. Let me get you the fabric cleaner\u201d and then hand them the appropriate cleaning tools and supplies. If it was intentional (like the children, not and adult\u2019s purse knocking over a cup at the edge of the counter for example) AND the stain isn\u2019t budging- then you add something like \u201cOh it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming out.

To account for others not parenting their kids or simply those times when accidents happen, my husband and I prep the house for guests when we know there\u2019s a risk of things getting messy. \nI put away anything fragile (I have a cabinet I toss my glass candles, etc into), put a plastic cover on the wooden dining room table, I actually put scotchgard on my chair fabric (though seat covers also work) and have Resolve ready. If we see things that are obviously going to lead to a mess, we ask the kids nicely if they can avoid doing things (like eating Cheetos in the living room) or create fun rules where they get their own kids table to eat or no one can have drinks in the living room, etc. I do find if I simply ask the kids in a fun friendly way, they are happy to be helpful (mostly; I do have a nephew who doesn\u2019t fit the usual mold, but he will respond to reminders and give me a whining drawn out okay or I negotiate with a reward for following the rules). I even have a few toys around for different kid age groups to keep them entertained with toys, instead of making our home decor their toys. I know it sounds excessive, but unfortunately part of being a part of a large family, I\u2019ve found that not everyone actually parents their children and sometimes accidents truly do happen.  \n\nI wish you and your boyfriend luck!

She said that he agrees with her and still he didn't say anything to his sister! He should be the one to talk to his family about this.\n\nOP your BF is also at fault here, not just SIL. HE needs to talk to his sister about this and to stand up to them, not to make you responsible for all this.\n\nNTA", "You folks kill me with being so timid, and not addressing these issues, on the spot. YTA, for not immediately addressing these issues on the prior events.", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019d get some of those ostentatious clear plastic covers for your furniture, and tell them that they\u2019re only allowed to sit on covered furniture because they\u2019ve proven they can be trusted with adult furniture. \n\nOr maybe just plastic lawn chairs. Depends on how petty I\u2019m feeling.", "NTA - but this is a bf problem- he just sat there and watched he needs to manage his family", "I am on the fence of NTA and YTA. If you don\u2019t speak up, you cannot expect people to understand and do something regardless if it\u2019s common sense to you. \nInvest in some plastic coverings wherever you\u2019ll be sitting, say you love the kids and you love your furniture so you found a solution. Call it a day.", "NTA but your bf should have spoken up in your behalf, since he knows you have social anxiety & its his stuff too (I'm assuming?) He needs to be direct & tell them all why they aren't invited this year", "Your partner should have said something immediately. My sister did this with my nephew. We'd just got brand new furniture and he was jumping all over  it with dirty feet and scraping a key along a leather sofa. It told him immediately to stop, took him off the furniture, gave him to her and told her to watch her child if she still wanted to come round. He has been as good as gold since.", "NTA - never let the heathens in your home again.", "NTA.  It's a shame, as you say, that your nieces are being raised this way.  Feral is a good word.  There's no excuse for it.  I'm baffled how people can allow their kids to destroy other people's property.", "Why did your bf not say anything to them. It is his family.", "Yta they aren\u2019t mind readers. Tell people your expectations. You sound tiresome.", "This. OP, I try to watch my kids carefully at people's houses, but I can miss things. If no one ever says anything, how is anyone supposed to know? And can you get those chair covers before the holiday? You can get some for like $30 on Amazon and cover all the chairs. You can also have your BF just tell them, \"In the past, the kids have stained our furniture, would it be possible for everyone to keep a closer eye on them this year? And how do you want us to address it if they are staining something?\" \n\nYou have to use your words.", "Why didn't your bf speak up?", "Social anxiety is like stitches on your mouth and a brick wall stopping you from getting out of the corner you're sitting in.\n\nIt wasn't that easy for her.", "But how will they know it's an issue with you if you never brought it to their attention?\n\nI get that you have social anxiety, so why didn't your older thirtysomething boyfriend who not only agrees with you help say something to his own family?? It's his furniture too (I assume he also help paid for).\n\nThe past is in the past, but did you start cleaning the stains right away when it happened? Some things can be said without saying anything. Other ppl suggesting covers is a good idea, but it also sounds like you are already annoyed by now and done with them.\n\nMoving forward, think about what outcome you want here. That would be the more mature thing to do. \n\nWould an apology and promise to watch/train their kids be enough to get a trial visit? If it happens again, but they apologize right away and try to help clean...would you be forgiving or is it no tolerance from now on? If this isn't well-received, are you prepared to deal with having a conflicted relationship with your BF's family or do you know this issue won't go away for you and needs to be aired out?", "I agree except for her explaining part. I think the boyfriend needs to do it since it\u2019s his family. He should be having her back a little better by talking to his family about the problem. Then they are giving a united front that his siblings kids can\u2019t ruin OP\u2019s stuff!", "lol", "Sure it is, for me, because I have no problems speaking up. And I have no problems getting out of bed because I don\u2019t have those kinds of problems. My problem is I have no filter but it sure as hell doesn\u2019t ruin peoples furniture like the feral brats OP is talking about. My first thought too was that it\u2019s her fault for not speaking up but after her comment now I actually know better. However the boyfriend is a slight asshole for not getting on his family for allowing it."]}
