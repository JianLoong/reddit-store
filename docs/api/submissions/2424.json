Last year we hosted a huge Thanksgiving dinner at our house and his parents, his sister and her three children came. Her two youngest children were 5 and 2 years old at this time. We had just finished furnishing our house with a brand new sectional, dining table and chairs and a ten piece outdoor furniture set for our deck. During dinner I sat next to my boyfriends mom and sister who was holding the youngest child. I watched as they let the child rub cranberry sauce all over my brand new cream colored dining chairs. They said nothing and did nothing to stop it. My friends who were there said they could see the steam coming out of my ears. It was my first holiday with his family and I didn\u2019t want to lose my temper in front of everyone. So I waited until they left the table and started scrubbing the chairs trying to get the stains out (some of which are still there a year later). They never apologized to me for letting their children trash my house and this wasn\u2019t the first time they\u2019d done it. They had came over a couple of months before this and smeared melted chocolate all over my cream colored cushions on my brand new outdoor furniture. Again, while their parents sat there and watched. A couple days after Thanksgiving I mentioned all of this to my boyfriend and he agreed that it was rude, but said it was ultimately my decision if I wanted to continue inviting them over. It\u2019s been a year now and I haven\u2019t invited them over since, and his mother has started dropping hints about getting together at our house again but I know if I invite his parents over they\u2019ll want to invite the sister. Next week I am hosting thanksgiving again, but only inviting my family. Am I the asshole for not wanting my boyfriends feral nieces to destroy my home?", "created_utc": 1668550990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywbhn2/aita_for_not_inviting_my_boyfriends_family_to/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He should have said something to his sister the first time it happened.   \n By telling you it's ultimately your decision removes any responsibility or blowback for him.  You become the bad guy.

It perfectly polite to ask someone to watch their children in the dining room. You can keep in that simple.

The other option is to move all the nice stuff to the garage and put plastic chairs out everywhere while they are over.", "why didn\u2019t your BF speak up if you weren\u2019t comfortable doing so?", "NTA. It's your home and you should be able to maintain it however you wish. However, I don't know how reasonable it is to completely ban people from your home without them knowing why. After having read the comments, I'm going to go a bit further:\n\n1. **It's your responsibility as a homeowner to make sure that people know the rules of your house.** I've been to houses where people don't want shoes indoors or where they don't allow food/drink in certain areas. Yes, some people might think you're picky, but it's not their home. People often assume that their norm is everyone's norm and they won't know any different unless you tell them. Practice saying things like, \"Oh, I'd prefer the kids didn't eat \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ (chocolate, cranberry sauce etc) on the furniture. These chair pads stain easily.\"\n2. **If you are going to have kids in your home, there's going to be a bit of a mess.** It's not reasonable to expect that there will be no mess with a 5 yo and a 2 yo. Plus, some kids are just messier than others. Yes, the degree of messiness can be due to lax parenting (as it sounds is at least partly the case here), but some of it is just the kids themselves. Get chair covers, cover the area they are sitting on with blankets etc. Whatever you need to do to make yourself feel better or to lessen the mess, do it. Another thing you can do to help is to make foods that are less messy.\n3. **Each person in a couple should take point on dealing with their own family members.** Ultimately, your boyfriend should address this with his sister or mom the next time there are hints about you hosting. It can be very simple and non-committal: \"Well, Mom, the last few times the kids have been over, they were allowed to rub food into our furniture, which cost us quite a bit of time to clean. We understand that kids come with some mess, but we also would prefer that they were more closely supervised in our home.\"\n\nIn the end, it's up to you and your boyfriend to come to a consensus about whether or not you will allow his family to visit. However, I hope you can find your voice and speak up, because I can guarantee this won't be the last time something like this comes up and just avoiding the situation all together only works for so long.", "INFO: what is your boyfriend\u2019s opinion on all this?", "NTA\n\nAlso: hopefully you are working on your anxiety and ability to speak up kindly but firmly in these situations. Until you are, BF needs to do the communicating, especially with his family. \n\nIF you have the children over again (or even if there is a complete accident with otherwise-careful guests) just casually say something like \u201cOh I see Little Buford rubbed cranberries into the cushions. Let me get you the fabric cleaner\u201d and then hand them the appropriate cleaning tools and supplies. If it was intentional (like the children, not and adult\u2019s purse knocking over a cup at the edge of the counter for example) AND the stain isn\u2019t budging- then you add something like \u201cOh it doesn\u2019t seem to be coming out. We\u2019ll have to have it professionally cleaned. We\u2019ll let you know the cost so you can reimburse us\u201d", "Where is 31 year old boyfriend in this? Two people live there, and it's his sister who is under-parenting her children.", "NTA. His family is disrespectful and they let their kids act like little savages.\n\nKids are stupid, but some of their parents are just as dumb. Your BF should have been the one handling his family. That this has continued is more of an indictment on him than anyone else, tbh.", "ESH. You owe it to yourself and those kids to correct them immediately.

And you don't have to say you were furious that their kids stained your couch, you can simply say it is waaaaay harder/more expensive than you thought to get stains out of it and  \"you know what they say: prevention is better than cure.\" Keep it light and very \"I didn't think it would be so difficult...\" to avoid seeming accusatory if you think it will help and then direct everyone to the table. (Though, personally, I'd probably still get couch covers if you have any kids over. Just in case. Kids so often think it's hilarious and fun to run away from the frazzled adult trying to stop them while sticky or carrying spillables...)", "You couldn't speak up after the SECOND time your BF's sisters kids smeared food on your furniture?

But at this point you have stained furniture and a strained relationship and they don\u2019t seem to have any idea there\u2019s a problem, which I think is a bit unfair to them. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit weird that you\u2019re boyfriend cares so little about any of this though.

I donated it to a women and children's shelter.", "The part of it that I'm  questioning isn't the kids' behaviour, it's all the rest of you just watching it happen with not a peep from anybody.\n\nWhatever, NTA if you never want them over again.", "Yeah it\u2019s hard, but it\u2019s just one of those things that will boil over the longer it simmers.

It is your house as well, your furniture as well, and your boyfriend apparently supports you on this issue, so, it is quite clear.
