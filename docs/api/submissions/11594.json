BTW, some mothers can be a bit 'judgey' when it comes to their daughter. Maybe her mother was like that to her (not making excuses, but sometimes the apple does not fall far from the tree). My mother certainly was. Made having a relationship difficult sometimes. Like you, sometimes I didn't share things I wanted to because of this. It is possible that your mother reacted this way because she understand the morbidity of allergic reactions. She was probably terrified. \n\nHOWEVER, I'm sorry to say, but your motheris right - it was irresponsible to not see a doctor earlier. Do it NOW! Swelling of the lips is very close to swelling of the throat. I have an allergy to onions (I know - weird). I will go into anaphylactic shock if I am even around them if the skin is cut open. I have nearly died a couple times because of it. (God bless epi-pens!) You have a brand new baby who needs her mother. This is very serious. BTW, allergies graduate. Mine started out as headaches (teens), facial swelling (20s), to full blown attacks (late 20s). Stick to a bland diet until you find out what the cause is.", "NTA you just set a boundary and asked her not to talk to you that way. Nothing wrong with that. Her response wasn\u2019t helpful or kind. Hope the doctors can help you find out what you\u2019re allergic to! (and I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t judge you at all)", "NTA. At some point in everyone's life they have to set boundaries with their parents. Congratulations on doing it earlier than most.", "NTA\nYour mother is just being rude and judgemental. Neither are conductive to a good adult relationship. If she's not going to talk to you like she would another adult, then you may need to share less with her.", "NTA.  What a nasty thing for her to say to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Good on you for standing up for yourself and telling her to speak to you with respect. \n\nLife gets busy. As a parent, you tend to put off your own care to focus on your child and it's easy to let something go for a while if it's manageable for the time being. No judgements there. I hope you find an answer to your issue sooner than later.", "NTA for setting boundaries.", ">  my whole life she\u2019s never been the person I feel like I can talk to because I always feel judged.\n\nNTA but eiyher establish/enforce boundaries or consider putting her on what many people call an \"information diet\".  If you're not sure how to do any of this, a counselor might be helpful.", "NTA\n\nThat is rude of your mom to say. Your mom is making you out to be irresponsible.\n\nAny respectful person would've said something like \"I hope they figure out what is making you allergic\".", "me being petty, if she were my mother I\u2019d pull the teen mom card. would shut her up real quick", "NTA. You are allowed to set boundaries with anyone you want. While she isn\u2019t wrong that you should have made time to see a doctor sooner especially with allergies she could have been supportive and approached it from a what can I do to help you see the doctor about this angle not let\u2019s be rude. \n\nThe doctor won\u2019t judge you for waiting. Many times people with allergies deal with it and try to figure it out without going to the doctor and getting tested. \n\nHope you figure out what is causing it.", "NTA\n\nYour mom was being rude. A doctor is not going to judge you for trying to do basic elimination before going in for an allergy test--they understand that particularly in the US, medical appointments cost money.", "NTA - Don't take this the wrong way, but you're just now figuring out that firing back is OK? Mom is being an AH and she needs to feel like one... I'd just stop talking her until she figures it out. But don't be surprised if she doesn't... they can be stubborn.", "Time to switch mom to a low info diet.  Us moms don't do awesome at putting our health first, and part of that is because of the burden of all the expectations we carry. Mothers should understand and support and lift up daughters, not be shitty about it. You are doing your best, and I'm sure you're doing amazing at it. Best of luck at the doctor. \n\nNTA", "NTA- our parents always know how to push our buttons because they installed them. \n\nYou are starting to establish boundaries with her. And it makes sense- you are an adult, you are responsible for your own kid- you are shifting as a person with all of these changes. It is naturally going to reflect what you will and won\u2019t take from your mom. \n\nI know a trick to help diffuse these buttons. The first- the next time she pushes your buttons imagine her at 18 or 19 holding you at the same age your kid is now. Imagine her scared and totally unprepared to deal with what was coming. And just say, \u201cshe did the best she could with the skills she has\u201d. Take a deep breath and let her go. YMMV \n\nHer rudeness, her judgement- all of that is defensive behavior. She may or may not be aware of it depending on how stuck the events of her life have made her. And it sucks that you can\u2019t just feel loved and understood by your mom. I get it. My mom was the same. I found great relief when I was a little older than you and it finally clicked with me that getting her to understand was a losing battle. That she loved me in her own way. And while I grieved I also began to allow myself to find other ways to get the needs met that I still had that she missed. Some of it was therapy and some of it was building a strong community of women around me. \n\nGood luck, new mom, you are doing great.", "Right! Like \"hey mom I've been struggling to find the time to go to a doctor about this but it's not like I had my kid at 18 years old like SOMEONE....\"", "Thank you so much. I\u2019m sure she responded the way she did because she\u2019s genuinely worried about me but I wish she was nicer in her delivery. I\u2019m always made to feel like I\u2019m stupid and I\u2019m almost positive she\u2019s the reason I have so much anxiety as an adult. I think I just need to accept that there are certain things I cannot tell her"]}
