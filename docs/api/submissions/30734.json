Was he supposed to have rotating best men?", "YTA - they can pick who they want. You\u2019re being petty and over dramatic about not attending because you\u2019re not getting your way.", "ESH. Your brother should be more respectful of your feelings, but he probably has to manage a lot of demands with his fiances family.

You\u2019re incapable of being there to support and celebrate your sibling because you\u2019re expected to be a guest without a title? Come on! You can be better than that. \n\nHonestly, do you really want to spend all the time and money on all the bridesmaid requirements anyway?\n\nJust go & have fun.

Not going to the wedding of someone you claim to love bc you didn\u2019t get a star role in it is petty, spiteful, and childish.", "YTA. They can pick whoever they want for their bridal party for any reason. The whole \u201cmarried\u201d thing is probably just an excuse.\n\nAre you really close with your future SIL? If not, then that\u2019s why, and you need to move on. Their wedding isn\u2019t about you. If you are super close with her, then talk to her about it.", "I would say thank you for not making me do all that but that\u2019s just me. Being a bridesmaid is expensive, time consuming, and stressful.", "That sil is probably the reason why", "YTA. Quit being such a drama llama. Their wedding is not about you, it's about them. The only person being rude here, is you. \n\nTraditionally, the bridesmaid were all unmarried, eligible young woman, usually relatives or close friends of the bride. Ditto with the groomsmen. Back when humanity was spread out and communication was difficult, a wedding was a way to meet potential spouses. It may be archaic, but if they want to follow that tradition, that is their choice...not yours. \n\nYou wanna stay home and raise a stink over it, fine, do it then. But all you're going to look like is a petty, immature AH who didn't their way and wasn't included in the wedding party. \n\nHonestly, if this is your typical behavior, I can see why didn't choose you.", "Their position seems a bit weird to me personally, but they seem to have a rationale behind it. At the end of the day, I think just focus on them having the best day possible, the way they envisioned it. I get that you might feel hurt, however making a big deal out of it to the point of not attending, I'd say makes YTA.", "ESH. The YTA votes are a bit ridiculous. If the BRIDE is having all of her siblings as bridesmaids and groomsmen, then OP's brother, who was the best man at her wedding and godparent to her first child, should have spoken up and ensured OP at least was involved in the wedding party or has a special part. It doesn't look like anything bad happened between the siblings. They also lied because being single has nothing to do with anything and I'm from the same culture as OP. They could have at least kept it real. Now where OP goes wrong is expecting everyone to have the same expectations as she does. It is your brother's wedding and his day. His choice (although I think it's all the bride and if so good luck with that marriage). He is justified in what he wants for his day, as much as you feel hurt and excluded. Maybe your relationship was closer than you thought. He showed his cards on how he feels about your sibling relationship, so run with it. \n\nI would attend the wedding, pay them dust, and not let them get to you. At least you can let loose, have fun, not be expected to take a bunch of photos, not shell out tons of money, and just do you. Make sure your man and you look HAWT! You are there as guests, nothing more! I would also politely decline any duties given from here on out until the wedding day. Bridal party, rehearsal dinner, son as ring carrier, reading Bible passage during the ceremony, additional activities, all would be a NO from me. Keep it cool, calm, collected, and maintain your distance for your peace. Your emotions are justified and you are allowed to feel hurt. How you continue forward is what matters as you want to enforce boundaries, but don't want to look like the bad person. Your brother should also know that he can't run to you with any issues anymore, that door is closed. Don't get your parents involved anymore. If they bring it up divert or close the conversation. As adults, it's between your brother and you and that is it. It's mind-boggling how family members get to be complete trash toward other family members and it is okay. At least he can't run back to you when issues happen because the relationship already sounds completely unbalanced and unstable. Do you and take people for what they show you to be!", "NTA, not because you\u2019re not in the wedding party, just that it\u2019s your right to attend or not.", "I have dreaded every wedding I have had to be part of the wedding party (well... except my role as groom).   I would be super psyched to being \"excluded\" and have tried to dodge it every time I can.\n\nMuch better to just be a guest and eat their food, drink their wine, and not have to deal with the hassle and time (photos take forever).", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s their wedding. They can have whoever they want in their bridal party", "NTAH!!! And that bridesmaid being  single, doesn't float anymore. It's their wedding, absolutely! It's not their decision, it's her, the brides decision. Your brother can't stand up to his new bride. And yes, you are totally being excluded.  This is just your new placement in her family setting. You aren't important to her. But she will expect things from you. If you don't go, it will be held against you, from now until the end of time. Choose carefully. I'd go, but I wouldn't do anything else, or contribute a dime for anything. Plus I'd give them a Dollar Tree toaster too. But I'm getting really petty in my old age too.", "This just sounds like a cultural thing. It\u2019s a lot less common now but I\u2019ve definitely been to weddings where bridesmaids (emphasis in maids) were the bride\u2019s unmarried relatives and the married attendant(s) were \u201cmatrons.\u201d It\u2019s okay to decide not to attend a wedding in any case, and it\u2019s normal to feel excluded when your friends choose other people for their bridal party when you asked them to stand with you at your wedding. I might go with NAH at this point, though it can easily go sideways if you\u2019re as angry and indignant as it sounds like you are", "INFO:\n\nWhat culture are you? Are you a different culture to the bride? Traditionally the bride and bridesmaids would be unmarried, and the best man would also be single (and usually the grooms brother) as his role was to step in and marry the bride if the groom was a no-show. Obviously not many people continue that tradition, but there\u2019s still plenty of archaic traditions involved in weddings (father giving away the bride to the husband for example)\n\nUltimately you can\u2019t declare yourself a bridesmaid, that\u2019s entirely up to the bride, and it\u2019s not unusual for a bride to prefer to have her own sisters or close friends as bridesmaids, rather than in-laws she doesn\u2019t know very well. \n\nAs for your husband and the ushers, how well does your husband know your brother? Of they\u2019re not that close I would just expect him to be a guest rather than an usher.\n\nAt the end of the day you can\u2019t force the bride to pick you and your husband to be in the bridal party, it\u2019s not your wedding so you get no say. Refusing to attend because if this makes you look incredibly petty and will damage your relationship with the family going forward.", "What sane person even WANTS to be in a wedding party?\n\nJust wondering?", "There are posts on reddit where the bride wants all the bridesmaids to be married of engaged. This is like that, but the other way round. \n\nYTA for your reaction to not being a bridesmaid.\n\nBeing a guest is way better anyway. You don't have to go on the hen party, you can wear what you want instead of something hideous to make the bride look pretty, no standing about for photos and you can start drinking much earlier, that's a win I'd say.", "YTA- why do you feel entitled to decide what they do at their wedding? \n\nHis participation in your wedding wasn\u2019t an unspoken agreement for you to participate in his later on. You had your wedding already, calm down. \n\nYou\u2019re essentially trying to manipulate them by threatening to not show up- it\u2019s coming off as petty and jealous.", "YTA. Bridesmaids are the brides choice. Full stop. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re not entitled to be in someone else\u2019s wedding. It doesn\u2019t matter if you included them in yours. \n\nNot your wedding. Grow up and get over your damn self.", "YTA.  They have no obligation to have you in the wedding party.  Go to the wedding and have a great time!  You just have to show up, have fun, and then go home. That is MUCH better than being in the wedding party!", "YTA. \n\nI wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid in my brothers wedding, frankly made the whole thing more enjoyable. Don\u2019t be petty. Seriously- who actually cares about this stuff?", "YTA. They're not obligated to put you in the wedding party. Also, it doesn't matter that *your* bridesmaids were married. This isn't your wedding.\n\nNow, you can choose not to attend any event for any reason. That said, this sounds extremely petty.", "OP is TAH. stop being a drama queen. Its the brides choice of bridesmaids, so get over it & stop acting childish", "Why do you want to be in the wedding party?  It's time consuming and expensive.  It's much more fun to just attend weddings without responsibility.  The time to be insulted is if you are excluded from family photos.\n\nGo and have a good time, or don't go if you don't want to.\n\nBut I think being excluded isn't then end of the world.\n\nThe unmarried part seems pretty arbitrary, but not worth ruining a family relationship over.\n\nIf you really want to do something, maybe there is another role you can do?  Usher or greeter?", "Well, why on earth should the bride choose you to be in her wedding party? You're neither family nor her close friend. \n\nIf I were your brother and you made this obnoxious, entitled demand and said you wouldn't attend otherwise, I'd consider myself lucky for your absence.\n\nYTA.", "YTA  - Not your wedding, not your choice of wedding party.

Not that it's supposed to be a guarantee, but I'm not the type of person that selects groomsman because I'm related to them or something. I only chose those closest to me.

You come across quite entitled.", "I\u2019m not sure what else you want me to address. Are my brother and my husband close? My brother was our best man\u2026 I think that\u2019s self explanatory. As far as the point that the bride gets to choose the bridesmaids, fair enough. Except that her 2 brothers are groomsmen and my brother has known them less than a year."]}
