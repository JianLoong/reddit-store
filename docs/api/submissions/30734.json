The only person being rude here, is you. \n\nTraditionally, the bridesmaid were all unmarried, eligible young woman, usually relatives or close friends of the bride. Ditto with the groomsmen.

If the BRIDE is having all of her siblings as bridesmaids and groomsmen, then OP's brother, who was the best man at her wedding and godparent to her first child, should have spoken up and ensured OP at least was involved in the wedding party or has a special part. It doesn't look like anything bad happened between the siblings. They also lied because being single has nothing to do with anything and I'm from the same culture as OP. They could have at least kept it real. Now where OP goes wrong is expecting everyone to have the same expectations as she does. It is your brother's wedding and his day. His choice (although I think it's all the bride and if so good luck with that marriage). He is justified in what he wants for his day, as much as you feel hurt and excluded. Maybe your relationship was closer than you thought. He showed his cards on how he feels about your sibling relationship, so run with it. \n\nI would attend the wedding, pay them dust, and not let them get to you. At least you can let loose, have fun, not be expected to take a bunch of photos, not shell out tons of money, and just do you. Make sure your man and you look HAWT! You are there as guests, nothing more! I would also politely decline any duties given from here on out until the wedding day. Bridal party, rehearsal dinner, son as ring carrier, reading Bible passage during the ceremony, additional activities, all would be a NO from me. Keep it cool, calm, collected, and maintain your distance for your peace. Your emotions are justified and you are allowed to feel hurt. How you continue forward is what matters as you want to enforce boundaries, but don't want to look like the bad person. Your brother should also know that he can't run to you with any issues anymore, that door is closed. Don't get your parents involved anymore. If they bring it up divert or close the conversation. As adults, it's between your brother and you and that is it. It's mind-boggling how family members get to be complete trash toward other family members and it is okay. At least he can't run back to you when issues happen because the relationship already sounds completely unbalanced and unstable.

It's not their decision, it's her, the brides decision. Your brother can't stand up to his new bride. And yes, you are totally being excluded.  This is just your new placement in her family setting. You aren't important to her. But she will expect things from you. If you don't go, it will be held against you, from now until the end of time. Choose carefully.

I might go with NAH at this point, though it can easily go sideways if you\u2019re as angry and indignant as it sounds like you are", "INFO:\n\nWhat culture are you? Are you a different culture to the bride? Traditionally the bride and bridesmaids would be unmarried, and the best man would also be single (and usually the grooms brother) as his role was to step in and marry the bride if the groom was a no-show.

Of they\u2019re not that close I would just expect him to be a guest rather than an usher.\n\nAt the end of the day you can\u2019t force the bride to pick you and your husband to be in the bridal party, it\u2019s not your wedding so you get no say.

He isn't explaining things to your satisfaction. I could guess several reasons for that.  One might be that his bride finds you difficult to get along with, but he wants to not hurt your feelings by telling you that.  Another might be the bride is a bridezilla and wants a \"a certain look\" in the photos, but you dont fit \"the look\" - you might be taller than all the others and the bride herself.

Either that or due to having such a large amount of options they chose to go traditionally instead of cutting out people for other reasons to not offend anyone. Weddings with too many in the wedding party can be difficult to coordinate so maybe thats why. So it's not a lie necessarily. She has her reasons whatever they are it's her wedding.

So you couldn't stand up for your SIL as a brides*maid* because you are married.  The only married people I have ever seen in a wedding are Matron of Honor or Best Man. The bridesmaids and groomsmen traditionally are single.\n\n  That isn't to say you can't make your own rules, but I have never heard of a brides*matron* before. Maybe that is what your brother meant when he said only single people are in the wedding party? Because they are not having a Best Man or Maid/Matron of Honor.  By not having those roles they are already changing traditions.  Maid/Matron of Honor has a lot of duties and really has a big financial burden as she helps the Bride plan and arrange things.  It depends on the Bride of course, but some delegate a lot of tasks onto their Maid/Matron of honor.  \n\nDo yourself a favor and let this go. It's not a tit for tat situation.
