Confront Jake to hash it out or get over it.", "YTA. What you're basically saying is \"I want my boyfriend to make Jake's girlfriend feel excluded the way Jake made me feel excluded.\" You do see how bad this sounds, yes? You are punishing your boyfriend and Jake's girlfriend\u2014both of whom are innocent in this situation\u2014for something Jake did. You also don't get to control who he invites to his graduation. This is quite a childish way to handle the situation and if you're resorting to this kind of thing eight years into the relationship, you really need to do some work on communicating. Obviously there's still a problem concerning what Jake did to you, and that's valid. If you feel your boyfriend hasn't properly addressed that with Jake, you should talk to him about that. If you are friends at all with Jake, you should just talk to him instead. But you need to let this go.", "YTA\n\nFirst off, who are you to allow him or not?

Were there actually physical invitations? It's possible that he expected Lucas to extend the invitation to you. If Lucas wasn't sure, he should have asked Jake before the party.
