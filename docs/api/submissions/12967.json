Be clear: \u201cI do not want to touch Shelby. I want her to hear me when I say I\u2019m behind her. However, she has already pushed me once, causing a tray of drinks to spill on a customer.

Especially when you have the rest of your coworkers confirming that the light touch is appropriate and necessary.\n\nI'd bring up the fact to your boss that you did stop as soon as she told you to, and that she wasn't aware enough to hear your \"behind you\" which caused an accident. Ask them quite frankly what they would have you do with that situation.", "NTA, I'm pretty sure this is fairly common amongst servers. I've only ever worked in quick service and it happens there.

From reading others comments I understand it's the norm for the profession.  I know for myself I would be very uncomfortable with it, as touch from behind is a trauma trigger for me but that's on me to manage and not go into a job where it's required or the norm.  Perhaps Shelby has a similar reaction but then she shouldn't be in the profession if she does.", "I was going to suggest this too! If it isn't clear to the owner, or to Shelby, the other servers should make it clear that they also tap shoulders to get around safely when it's too loud.

Maybe they worry about consequences for themselves.", "Happy cake day", "That's a horrible idea.", "Well I'd get signed statements from co-workers and prepare for the unfair dismissal lawsuit that may happen.

I don't support your owner being mad at you or you getting suspended, but in general I do support someone's right to say they don't want to be touched.\n\nWe work jobs - especially harder ones like restaurant staff - due to a system that requires it or forces starvation upon us. Under those types of coercive terms, I don't feel great effectively telling someone that doesn't want to be touched that they have lost their bodily autonomy.\n\nIt's easy to say \"get into another line of work if you don't want to be occasionally touched in a non-sexual way\" but I don't really like that sentiment because all of us in the bottom 99% are on the same team. Idk, I got no answer for this one other than wishing the person in question had been more willing to discuss it with you rather than a single comment and straight to the owner especially given that you spilled onto a guest as a result.\n\nThat's not me saying you did something wrong, that's me being unhappy at the idea that someone who doesn't want to be touched has to allow it in order to make a living.", "NTA and not that it\u2019s your problem, but if the owner doesn\u2019t know how FOH staff operate (\u201cbehind you\u201d / \u201cdoor\u201d / light taps are all SOP) then they really shouldn\u2019t be running a restaurant full of them.\n\nEdit: sp", "NTA.

If so, I'd ask if she is discriminating against you and forcing you into an unsafe work environment purely because of your gender?", "NTA and remind the owner that spacial awareness is required for this job and losing customers because of bad service, like spilling drinks on customers due to a server bumping into another server because of the lack of spacial awareness, is going to impact the bottom line much worse and reputation is harder to recover from than being frivolously sued by a crappy server that cannot do their job properly because of their own sensory issues.", "NTA\n\nI waited on while at uni, and we wait staff (all cis-het men) all did this with each other all the time.\n\nThat said, some people may be uncomfortable with it.
