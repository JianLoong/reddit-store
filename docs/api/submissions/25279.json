Your mom isn\u2019t looking out for her children\u2019s interests. She needs to get some self respect and not allow herself to be treated the way he treats her. That may require therapy.", "NTA. WTF with anyone expecting you to see him that way", "NTA - first of all, it's nobody's obligation to treat their parents' partners as their parents. being your parent's loved one doesn't mean they have to be yours. secondly, nothing in this post has me convinced it's safe for him to be around you, your siblings, or your mom. even if he's providing you with a place to stay - it's not a kindness, it's a way for him to control yall. if anything, your mom is TA for continuing to allow herself and especially her children be put through that. i hope you all find a safe way out.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s not your dad. Fathers shouldn\u2019t act like that. If he were a decent human being, you still wouldn\u2019t be an AH because it\u2019s *your* relationship with him. Not anyone else\u2019s.

Unfortunately it sounds like your mom is willing to be an apologist for the fact he is a shitty partner, including hitting(!!!) her and patronizing her. Ultimately, her choices have ramifications on you, and your relationship with both her AND boyfriend. You are NOT required to like him, indeed it sounds like you've been more civil than he deserves.\n\nI hope you can get out of this terrible home situation asap and you take from this that 1) you are not at fault for any of this 2) your mom provided a terrible example of parenting to you 3) you can seek other \"father figures\" and role models who do not act this way.", "NTA. \n\nBig hugs to you.

In the situation it really sucks being 16, your basically just stuck doing whatever your mom tells you to do because you're still too young to legally make your own decisions. All you can do is make the best of the situation until you are able to go off on your own.  In the end, it is your mom's choice if she wants to stay with him. You've been a good daughter and expressed your concerns with how he treats her and the rest of you, and if she's not going to change things, all you can do is make the best of the situation you're in until you can choose to remove yourself.  I wouldn't say you need to be nice to him and accepting of him as your father figure, but try your best to ignore him and avoid the conflict.  I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope you have some good friends and other family that you can escape to and talk to when things are getting tough. Stay strong.  You can become a more well rounded person and learn from your mother's mistakes and never allow a man to be so controlling and cruel!", "NTA - even though I believe there's your truth, his truth and then the real truth in the middle somewhere; any version of this is way over the line.  Cheating, physical and emotional abuse?  You have no reason to look at this man like a father, he's yet to act like one.

College or trade school--there are jobs you can get that will put you through these, there are also lots of programs and funds for low income students to get scholarships.\n\nIt's admirable that you want to get out, get a car, an apartment and rescue your siblings. To do that, you need good income. It might take a little longer, but college or trade school. Trade school is faster, but you'll need to be able to work with your hands and the jobs can be more grueling. They tend to pay really well. Things like welding, plumbing and electrical work are universally needed everywhere. \n\nIf you are less concerned with housing your siblings in the future, the military would also give you a good pathway to education--and they will house you and feed you in the process. You can start talking to recruiters at age 16. Take the ASVAB test at your high school. \n\nIf you want to go to college, concentrate on getting the best possible grades you can. Go ahead and work part time too. You can practice for both your classes and the SAT on Khan Academy (free online tutoring resource). If you have time, do an extracurricular or two--those look good on college apps. It's okay if all you have time for is working your job. You must finish high school for any of these options to work. \n\nClearly, you need to get away from this loser your mom is dating. You are NTA.
