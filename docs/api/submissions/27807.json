If more people spoke up when a friend was out of line, the world would be a safer place. \n\nHe's definitely leaving parts out. One does not get multiple complaints by simply initiating friendly conversation. The chances of her simply getting up and making a complaint because he asked her name are very very small. \nIt's like the guys who claim they can't give a woman a compliment anymore, when they're actually cat calling. There's a way to say \"your dress looks lovely\" without being a total creep. However, that requires some self reflection and it's easier to simply pretend that feminists want to outlaw men talking to women. \ud83d\ude44\n\nMost people will not object to \"hi, my name is ___ what is your name?\", and don't usually go right to \"I'm married\" in the first sentence. So the fact that she needs to say this seems to suggest that there was something he said or did that made her feel uncomfortable and like she was being hit on and was not interested. It's also likely that when she indicated she was not interested he didn't take no for an answer. \n\nLeaving aside the whole thing about women having to mention a fiance, boyfriend or husband to get some men to leave them alone is awful...\n\nYour friend needs to think about how he is approaching people.

Smiling isn't an invitation, for anything. As a dude I've been made very aware of the 'damned if you do, damned if you don't' existence that many women have to go through :(", "I'd like this comment except the \"naive\" part. I called him out and haven't changed my opinion.", "If you want chitchat and connections with a stranger, go to a bar. Gyms are for working out.", "The good advice was \"don't try to run your game at the gym\". Sure enough he got kicked out when he did. So I fail to see how I was shutting him down when they already did", "He admits he was attracted to her and the purpose was to ask her out. He admits she was older and was 'his type'. So he did approach her unexpectedly with the purpose of dating when she was just minding her own business. So unless she was acting in a provocative manner than there was no reason for it.", "Well 1. There's a significant age gap and she was married which means he didn't consider that she might be in a relationship. 2. She didn't lead him to believe in anyway that she was interested. 3. If I'm the AH, why would they need to kick him out?\n\nI'm not the one who told him to leave I just told him not to hit on girls at the gym unless she somehow implied that she's interested.", "Na f the bro code on this one. I just didn't condone his bs. If you're gonna be a creep you're not a bro.\n\nBreaking bro code would be going after his gf.", "Found the incel", "Then he shouldn't have asked my opinion. It's not like I called the gym and ratted him out lol. No block was made I just stated it's not cool to creep on women at the gym.", "Well she is the recipient of bs in this case. Doesn't mean you have to pour acid in your eyes after Everytime u check someone out. Just don't approach them at the gym, especially uninvited.", "Something very similar was on Ask A Manager a day ago. The gym manager was blaming the young woman instructor for not shutting down a \"socially awkward\" young man who asked for her phone number, in a more assertive manner or sthing. On the day that a young girl in London got knifed to death for turning down flowers offered by a boy at her school.\n\nI am so, so tired of this sort of thing. That poor girl.", "Na he was like, these were false accusations and this is what I get for putting myself out there. He didn't react to negatively tho he says he accepted the rejection.", "Damn!", "As much as this is decent dating advice, gotta keep it out of the gym where they might already be feelin a certain way about getting approached in the first place. Pro tip, at least check for a ring lol", "it\u2019s possible that he wasn\u2019t lying about only approaching her, but may have had complaints made against him for staring. hitting on women isn\u2019t the only way to be a creep. intense staring and certain body language is enough to make most women uncomfortable.", "The gym is a bad place to hit on people. Best to leave people alone there. It\u2019s kinda creepy. I used to go to a gym at 4:30AM, it was empty, usually just a few other people. A lady would occasionally sit in the sauna with me topless. I wouldn\u2019t say a word and I wouldn\u2019t look at her at all. It\u2019s a place where people\u2019s privacy should be respected.", "You know him. Do you honestly have no doubts about his account of events?", "Thank you for being an ally.", "My thoughts too. Idk why OP keeps going back and forth on his stance on this. He \u201ccalled him out on it\u201d but thinks the employees could have had a slip of the tongue saying the multiple complaints to \u201csound legit\u201d?", "And regardless- leave people alone, especially women - they are there to do a workout and exercise, not to be bothered by inconsiderate jerks trying to hit on them. If there are multiple complaints - there you go : he\u2019s a jerk !", "Besides, that\u2019s a shitty way to approach someone in an environment. Instead you walk up and say \u201chi, my name is Brad, and I was wondering if you\u2019d like to chat for a moment?\u201d Don\u2019t start off by demanding information from someone you don\u2019t know.\n\nNow, having said that, when someone is working at their job, and the gym are frankly places that I think are no-fly zones for this kind of shit.", "Well to be fair, have you seen some of the gym videos women post to social media accusing people of being creeps or staring or something \u2026when that\u2019s also very clearly not what\u2019s happening. \n\nYou did clarify \u201crational person\u201d tho so that\u2019s kind of what everything hedges on lol", "It is possible for a woman to be irrational, you know.   And it's not uncommon for irrational people to exaggerate and outright lie about their interactions.", "Why are we assuming that the woman in the gym is a rational person? Seems like we're siding with her by default simply because she's a woman.", "You\u2019re assuming she was rational. People make up false reports all the time.", "Yeah. I've seen that video. It's insane what happens these days.\n\nGuys even looking at girls in gyms = kicked out\n\nGirls smacking guys on the ass during squats = ignored and laughed at online.", "Whatever resolves the problem fastest? Why would making up that they have multiple complaints resolve the problem fastest, when that could be easily disproven if the guy complained to the gym for being removed? That could easily come back on the employee if they just lied like that with nothing to back it up", "I second this. Don't think it was more than one complaint. At. all.", "Definitely do call him out on it. Most women go to a gym to work out, its a specific place for specific goals.... if he wants to shoot his shot go to a singles club.", "If it was a one time thing, why did the staff say that they have had.....checks notes.... multiple complaints?  Someone's lying and I don't think it's the staff.", "Women go to the gym to go to excercise. \n\nThey do not go to the gym to be hit on. They want a safe place to excercise and sweat.\n\nEven if it's a one time thing, he's still the asshole.", "69CockAss69 it\u2019s so funny how creeps can\u2019t help but announce themselves lmao", "There's looking and there's staring.", "Do you think he knew that woman was married?", ">Well he's saying that the multiple complaints are BS that this was just a sole occasion where he found her particularly attractive and decided to go for it. \n\nI am sorry but your friend is full of shit.\n\nYou don't just get kicked out of a gym for politely asking someone their name.\n\nYou might want to take a closer look at your friend and consider his behavior, it very well can and will eventually blow back on you.", "You don't get multiple complaints from asking one person there name.", "Considering everything about the context, it was very clear that even if he only got to asking her name his intentions were still to make advances on her. Literally the only times I speak to someone I don't know at the gym is to ask if they're still using a particular station I want to use or to ask for a spotter, and in those cases that's what I lead with. Approaching someone in really any situation, but particularly at the gym, and leading with \"hey, what's your name?\" is about is transparent as it gets that you're either shooting your shot or trying to sell something, neither of which is a welcome advance most of the time. Add on to all of this that he watched her for a while and then ambushed her is even more evidence that this isn't the first time he's made unwelcome advances.\n\nEven with all that aside, a person who come up to me at the gym to shoot their shot with no prior interaction clearly just wants to get laid, and isn't the kind of person I'm going to be receptive to.", "I don't see anything wrong with it? I've talked to people at my gym before, what of it?\n\nAnd yes, I think you're an asshole for saying he's out of line if all he did was just ask her name. Unless there's a lot missing, I don't see how that warrants the response received from the woman herself, the gym, or you.\n\nHence why I think there's more to this story.", "Pretty sure your buddy picked the wrong one and got caught lackin. The best thing we can do for our friends is hold them to the standards they espouse. Let him cry about it.", "I\u2019ve made plenty of friends there", "And? The question is if in the given situation, the lady/gym's reaction was an overreaction. The answer is yes, because he hadn't actually done anything (yet). He approached one lady and said one sentence asking their name. That is not enough to be kicked out of a gym.", "Some guys don't think it's hitting on them unless they explicitly ask them for something. So this guy could have been going around saying things like \"Damn girl, you're looking nice!\" or \"I love to see you stretch like that.\" Which could still be uncomfortable for women who may report it. \n\nThose types of guys are often oblivious to the fact they're a creep and think women should take what they're saying as a compliment. When they get confronted they often get pissed off because in their mind \"they're just being nice and people are too sensitive.\"", "Sparklefart666, thank you for being reasonable and respectful. Do not bother strangers at the gym. I\u2019m there to workout and sweat like a farm animal, nothing else", "But it is rare for the gym staff to lean into that and say there are multiple complaints and to please leave for the evening. \n\nBuddy was probably overzealous, and they're hoping time away will reset his actions.", "You\u2019re right. She\u2019s probably crazy. Probably on her period or a lesbian.  Jesus, maybe even a lesbian on her period.  Why else would she not appreciate OP\u2019s friend\u2019s advances while she\u2019s trying to workout?  It\u2019s all so obvious.", "I think it\u2019s FAR more likely that he is lying than that she is in the like 0.01% of people who would report someone to the gym staff for asking their name. It could be that she\u2019s actually a paranoid schizophrenic person but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the most likely explanation. It has nothing to do with her being a woman.", "Totally agree with you. This is not his first time being creepy, people hit on each other all the time at the gym. I think quite alot of people reported him because he was being a creep and acted in a predatory way.", "Yes it could come back to haunt them but there is a possibility that it was a slip of the tongue to sound legit in asking him to leave. Sometimes we can be a bit quick to want to demonize someone after making a simple mistake. Especially these days with social media.", "[removed]", "Or anywhere that is not a public setting where ppl are just their for a specific purpose.", "You're most likely right but his friend was trying to say they were false accusations so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. But yea you're probably right.", "This is why so many of my local gyms have \"women's only\" areas. We just want to squat heavy and not have to worry we're being ogled.", "No but it's not the point. She didn't lead him on in anyway that I can tell that would welcome the advance. Ppl aren't there to be bothered with those motives.", "Well that's why I called him out. We're not best friends or anything btw he just confided in me and I told him not to creep on women at the gym", "Could be but I wasn't there and I kinda think it's inappropriate to try and meet girls at the gym. If it was a bar, different story.", "Ya I'm not hating on making friends but he's clearly trying to pick up.", "Well you might be right about that and I admit it might be a bit extreme but should he even be tryna make that shot? Remember he doesn't know her at all", "Exactly!", "All possible.   But most likely she was just super annoyed and told the gym staff an honest account of what happened.", "If you really want to get to the bottom of it, you can ask the gym itself. She felt uncomfortable enough about his approach to go straight to the employees. The employees felt it was a bad enough situation to kick him out for the day. What he said happened, doesn\u2019t add up for multiple people to act that way, plain and simple.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

When a person says something is false, they are probably the liar.  Why would the gym staff lie?  Unless this woman is completely unhinged, he didn't just ask for her name either.  Asking someone what their name is, is not a bad thing, he may have said more. \n\nI have only been approached at my gym once, I told him I had a boyfriend and that was all.  Someone asking my name is not threatening, I don't count that as an approach or hitting on.  Some men at the gym are just creepy, if he is one of those who just stares at the women and has his hands in his pockets a lot...bad vibes. \n\nNTA", "Ask yourself why the gym staff would have more of a motivation to lie than your friend would.", "The gym has security cameras, I\u2019m sure. Your friend is likely lying", "I don't disagree with you, but as per your account it doesn't even sound like he even got to the point of flirting with her, or hitting on her or literally anything short of asking her name.", "Probably not, in the sense that most people don't go to the gym to socialize. They go because they don't have the money/storage space for personal equipment. So they think by approaching them, you are encroaching on their private time even if in a public space. \nPersonally, I wouldn't view it any different then if two separate people were say, waiting in line at a restaurant, or enjoying their time at a public park, and one approaches the other. As long as you're respectful of them telling you to leave them alone, I wouldn't have a problem with it. But some people definitely would.", "Well I called him out for it without calling him a total creep and hopefully he stops doing it.", "Asked for her name after staring at her and making her whole workout uncomfortable maybe.", "Yea he claims he just just awkwardly laughed at the rejection and walked away and then they came and asked him to leave. Checking someone out is a lot different than approaching them though.", "Nah dude you have to get to the bottom of it because your friend is definitely a dirty pig. You should call up the gym and harass whoever is working there with odd questions about a guy who flirts with girls at the gym. Definitely a fucking pig. Also I work customer service where my coworkers would never lie about a situation to help resolve it quicker. Whenever a table is being obnoxious we go over and point to the other table that complained about them and let them know they were the one who complained. /s", "How so? Staring at someone and checking them out at the gym is still terrible behavior. Let women work out without bothering them.", "Depends. A quick glance, or admiring form and/or the weight someone is moving? No issues. Hardcore staring someone down, ogling, and/or following them around the gym? Not acceptable and absolutely creepy behavior.", "Yea. I mean I'm not trying to shame every guy who's ever looked at or even felt a certain way about a beautiful girl, I'm simply stating that it's inappropriate to approach them if they havent shown any interest towards you. I've been ogled by girls and I'm like, \"damn I'm looking good today I guess. Getting them gains\". Doesn't mean I'm tryna pick her up or vise versa.", "It\u2019s also not appropriate for a girl to be ogling a guy. But also you have to think about the level of harm potential involved. If a creepy girl is ogling you and comes up to you, are you scared about what she could potentially do to you? Probably not. If a girl is being ogled by a creepy guy (any guy is creepy once he\u2019s ogling you) there is some real harm that he could potentially do to her.\n\nLike I\u2019m glad you view it as a compliment, that\u2019s awesome. But you have to understand that for women more often than not it\u2019s going to come across as a potential threat more than anything.", "Ya I agree with the fact that it is impolite to stare but I'd be lying if I said I never saw someone I found attractive and didn't look. If they're purpose of being their is to scan on all the girls their then they are definitely a creep. But if they see one but don't act on it you can't demonize that. It happens.\n\nIf all he did was look I would be the AH but he tried to physically engage with her for no reason other than to hit on her. That's why he was the one being the creep"]}
