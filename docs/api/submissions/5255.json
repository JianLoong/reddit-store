He\u2019s breaking the privacy of a therapy session - he deserves everything that\u2019s coming to him and more. You are unlikely the only person he\u2019s betrayed.", "You are not a \u201csnitch\u201d, you are a responsible adult acting to protect the privacy of yourself and others. This was an important lesson for him to learn. This was the right thing to do. \n\nNTA . Don\u2019t beat yourself up over it.", "NTA.  Not at all.  This classmate betrayed your trust and got what he deserved.  \n\n\nI am so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA.  He broke the single most important rule of group: confidentiality.  You did the right thing.", "NTA. He is the ah. Honestly I would stay away from him if possible. People like that generally don\u2019t change.", "and i just want to say i promise i'm not saying this for attention im telling the truth and i'm sorry i truly am sorry and i hope you believe me", "NTA in anyway here, you confided in a confidential environment and I\u2019m guessing that will now effect your confidence to ever do so again.  He is beyond an AH in this situation", "NTA - when you're doing group therapy its supposed to be confidential. They broke the rules, there suffering the consequences. Don't feel bad, you did the right thing for yourself and the other members of the group. \n\nWishing you health and happiness \ud83e\udd0d", "NTA. This isn\u2019t snitching. He did something he had expressly agreed not to in order to be in that group. He has to be held to account for your group to function.", "NTA, not even close. I know people turned the phrase into a joke, but this is meant to be a safe space. There's an agreement and understanding that makes it safe and this is the only way many people can even get close to discussing things in their life (as you have said). Many programs would simply boot someone for something like that.", "NTA at all what is said in the session is confidential and should not be talked about outside session. Also you shouldn\u2019t feel bad at all", "NTA.\n\nyou all agreed to not talk about things that happen during the group session then they just run around telling everyone about what happened during the group session.\n\nif they are willing to talk about private info like that behind someones back, then they can expect the consequences of  being snitched on and getting in trouble.", "NTA. It was supposed to be a safe space to discuss these things. He violated that policy and your privacy. You did exactly what you should've done and hopefully he'll know not to do this to anyone again.", "NTA, classmate didn't respect the rule + what kind of a shitty person do that jfc", "NTA", "NTA therapy is a safe space and you reported him for violating the rules that help make it that way.

As I've been starting to say to people. Play stupid game win stupid prizes. He definitely didn't respect the rules or your boundaries. You did the right thing. People who get upset about \"snitching\" are honestly people who shouldn't be doing the things they are doing. If you don't want to face the consequences that come to your actions don't do them to begin with.", "NTA it's not a rule that exists for no reason. He did something supremely shitty by sharing that information and making fun", "NTA reporting someone for breaking confidentiality is by no means snitching", "NTA!!! That is NOT minor, and that does NOT make you a snitch!!! The purpose of group therapy is to get support. Who's going to want to share if what's said doesn't remain confidential? I've been in a few different therapy programs. They are very strict, especially about confidentiality. People have been kicked out for violating privacy rules. Your classmate is lucky all he got was a lecture and a public apology.", "NTA\n\nThe popular feeling about \"snitching\" is childish. You have no reason or any moral obligation to cover up for somebody who is being an AH to you.\n\nIf you were an adult, in *some* circumstances you might just speak to them instead, but the basic thing is if you are part of a system then you work with that system when somebody does something wrong.\n\nYou have enough on your plate already with the therapy and the stuff thats causing it, you dont have to be responsible for this other guy's shit too.", "NTA. **The entire point of confidentiality** is that what's said in confidence doesn't get repeated outside of the setting, and he intentionally and maliciously broke confidentiality. He's simply finding out that in the real world, there are actual consequences for breaking confidentiality like that.", "He should never be in group therapy especially with you. Your privacy is the utmost importance! \n\nYou did exactly what you needed to do. Keep\nUp the good work! And keep Working on you!", "A phrase I find dear: Evil only triumphs when good people do nothing. \n\nTelling a cop you saw a tent in the thicket or someone sleeping in their car, just trying to survive, is snitching. Telling the appropriate people through the appropriate channels that someone is being cruel . . .that's just a good person making sure evil doesn't triumph.", "thank you so much but btw i am not an adult i am in my sophomore year of highschool", "There\u2019s actually no reason not to believe you when you\u2019re speaking confidentially. Thats the point of it being confidential, because why would you lie to people who won\u2019t repeat what you\u2019ve said? You wouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy niece and nephew\u2019s dad is a narcissistic abuser. He does things that sound absurd because no sane person would do those things, but it\u2019s all true.", "Exactly! It's not minor. You didn't snitch\n And you're not a shitty person.", "You behaved in a very adult manner. You should be proud of yourself! NTA!"]}
