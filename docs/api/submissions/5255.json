I know people turned the phrase into a joke, but this is meant to be a safe space. There's an agreement and understanding that makes it safe and this is the only way many people can even get close to discussing things in their life (as you have said).

As I've been starting to say to people. Play stupid game win stupid prizes. He definitely didn't respect the rules or your boundaries. You did the right thing. People who get upset about \"snitching\" are honestly people who shouldn't be doing the things they are doing. If you don't want to face the consequences that come to your actions don't do them to begin with.", "NTA it's not a rule that exists for no reason. He did something supremely shitty by sharing that information and making fun", "NTA reporting someone for breaking confidentiality is by no means snitching", "NTA!!! That is NOT minor, and that does NOT make you a snitch!!! The purpose of group therapy is to get support. Who's going to want to share if what's said doesn't remain confidential? I've been in a few different therapy programs. They are very strict, especially about confidentiality. People have been kicked out for violating privacy rules. Your classmate is lucky all he got was a lecture and a public apology.", "NTA\n\nThe popular feeling about \"snitching\" is childish. You have no reason or any moral obligation to cover up for somebody who is being an AH to you.\n\nIf you were an adult, in *some* circumstances you might just speak to them instead, but the basic thing is if you are part of a system then you work with that system when somebody does something wrong.\n\nYou have enough on your plate already with the therapy and the stuff thats causing it, you dont have to be responsible for this other guy's shit too.", "NTA. **The entire point of confidentiality** is that what's said in confidence doesn't get repeated outside of the setting, and he intentionally and maliciously broke confidentiality. He's simply finding out that in the real world, there are actual consequences for breaking confidentiality like that.", "He should never be in group therapy especially with you. Your privacy is the utmost importance! \n\nYou did exactly what you needed to do. Keep\nUp the good work! And keep Working on you!", "A phrase I find dear: Evil only triumphs when good people do nothing. \n\nTelling a cop you saw a tent in the thicket or someone sleeping in their car, just trying to survive, is snitching. Telling the appropriate people through the appropriate channels that someone is being cruel . . .that's just a good person making sure evil doesn't triumph.", "thank you so much but btw i am not an adult i am in my sophomore year of highschool", "There\u2019s actually no reason not to believe you when you\u2019re speaking confidentially. Thats the point of it being confidential, because why would you lie to people who won\u2019t repeat what you\u2019ve said? You wouldn\u2019t. \n\nMy niece and nephew\u2019s dad is a narcissistic abuser. He does things that sound absurd because no sane person would do those things, but it\u2019s all true.", "Exactly! It's not minor. You didn't snitch\n And you're not a shitty person.", "You behaved in a very adult manner. You should be proud of yourself! NTA!", "To begin, definitely NTA. Of course you feel like you might have betrayed someone or like maybe you reacted over dramatically but it's actually so important to stand up for yourself in this way as well as anyone he could hurt in the future that might not be as resilient as you are. You were looking out for yourself and others. Hopefully he finds his peace because there's definitely something deeper going on there but people like that need to be checked for their actions. Good for you!", ">\ti know that makes me a snitch and a shitty person\n\nNo, it does not. You did the right thing.\n\nNTA", "NTA, this was the correct response.  Let's take a look at the scenario if this Doesn't get reported when someone does this.  People start thinking it's ok to drag private therapy info out into the open.  Eventually the coordinator or whoever is forced to act because if it happens too often people will wonder if they're actually doing their due diligence in reminding people that it's a safe space and meant to remain confidential.  They of course can only do thing about the things they know about so they only find out whan A) it's reported or B) it's become a big enough problem to have circled back to them through the rumor mill.\n\nWhen B happens their superiors likely also find out and they have to explain why their confidential group therapy isn't remaining so and even with a good explanation and the acknowledgement you can't control a group of people they still now have extra eyes on them to ensure they are putting proper effort forwards.  Which means they have to be stricter on rules and consequences and everyone ends up with less leeway for honest mistakes.  The reason those consequences were as harsh as they were is because the other option is to ban those who break the confidentiallity from the therapy that presumably since they are attending they have need of.", "NTA! He violated your privacy!", "NTA and I would refuse to tell anything else with him present and the reason why\u2026. In front of everyone", "First rule of Fight Club. Er, I mean high school.", "NTA. And what he did isn't minor.", "You\u2019re absolutely not a snitch or a shitty person. What your classmate did was completely unacceptable and a total violation of the privacy you should have had when you confided in the group. I hope this experience doesn\u2019t put you off reaching out for help in the future, and I wish you all the best.", "I really hope that he gets kicked out of that therapy group into private sessions as he doesn\u2019t know what confidentiality means. You did not overreact at all. It needed to be reported!  You are NTA!", "NTA- You should be able to trust everyone in a THERAPY GROUP. You can\u2019t feel safe opening up if you can\u2019t trust someone in it.", "As a therapist, you did well and i am very proud of you. Group therapy only works if it is a safe place for everybody. That classmate should get kicked out of it so that everyone else feels safer.\n\n\nNta", "I didn't realize my own (ex) husband didn't really understand or believe just how deranged and abusive my dad was until he witnessed it a few years into our marriage.", "Nta.\n\nThere is a reason why that rule exists and it is because it is a big deal when it is broken. Other people arent going to show the courage you did if these rules arent protected. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA this isn't snitching. This was him telling others private things you thought wouldn't leave a safe room. \n\nWhat he did could have let into you getting bullied and with everything that could result up to the worst possible outcome.\n\nYou did also save others from him. It takes courage to open up about problems and what he did was to set back members of this group therapy in showing them that it was not a safe place. Btw. where was the teacher/counsellor leading this group? They should have stopped him immediately after the first remark and maybe get him out of the room.", "NTA\u2026please realize his consequences are HIS PROBLEM!!!! This is a complete violation of the safety and sanctity of creating safe spaces. I hope the school deals with this in a way that brings home the fact this group is there to support you and now cause you more trauma!", "\ud83d\ude06", "NTA.\n\nDon't think you were a snitch. Even you go down that thought process, you would have snitched on a snitch then.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nIf telling the truth gets him in trouble then he deserves it.", "I believe you. People with functional families have no idea what it's like to grow up with abuse. To them it sounds far fetched but to us it's just another day ending in Y\n\nYou didn't deserve to have your trust and confidence violated when you're being brave enough to try to heal & break the cycle. \n\nBy the way I hate the term \"doing it for attention\" because like... of course? No duh. They should make a habit of asking WHY someone needs attention.", "Exactly this. Protecting your mental health and that of the others in your group isn't snitching. NtA", "NTA and you\u2019re not a snitch. He broke the rules and received the consequences for his actions", "There is nothing to apologize for -- you did nothing wrong. I believe you. \nNTA", "you were protecting not just you but everyone else in the group by reporting this behavior. that's what people are saying.\n\nif this kid is repeating what you said- there is a strong likelihood that he has either done this or would do this about what other kids said in the group. and that defeats the purpose- and the rules- of the group session.", "That is even more impressive because I know teens in a school setting face significant stigma and peer pressure to \u201cnot snitch,\u201d which leads to poor judgment at times.   \n\nYou were right to report him, as group therapy cannot be effective if people don\u2019t have a safe environment to be vulnerable without fear of exactly this.  Exposing the situation holds him accountable to you as well as alerts the other participants and facilitators to the issue so they can make informed decisions on whether to participate fully or allow him to continue to participate.  \n\nHopefully this is a good learning opportunity for him (and the group), but ultimately, if he cannot respect the rules and expectations of the group, he needs to be excluded from future sessions to maintain privacy and emotionally safe environment for the others."]}
