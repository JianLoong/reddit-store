You were in the middle of a family event and demanded he either spend an hour driving to get you a slushy, or leave the party after only just getting there. At the very least why couldn\u2019t you go yourself? I understand pregnancy cravings are tough but it\u2019s hardly a medical emergency. If you were in the middle of a work day would you just dip for an hour because you needed a slushy?", "YTA. Someone will have to explain to me in detail why a craving would need to me immediately satisfied to get me to change my view. Why is this a \"leave now\" and not a \"we will get one when we leave\" thing. \n\nCause otherwise you can use \"craving\" as a eject button for any interaction and it beholdens him to your any whim.  \n\nThere has to be a reasonability element to a request.", "**1) You really want something right now.**  \n\\- It's something you can get any day of the week.  \n\\- He wants you to wait 2 hours.\n\n**2) He really wants something right now.**  \n\\- It's something that happens once a week or less.  \n\\- You want him to wait a week or more.\n\n**Why do you win?**\n\nWhy do you get to decide that his want isn't important and he should wait instead of you waiting AND probably also being able to get what you want just 2 hours later?\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nA pregnancy craving isn't a reason to leave a family event. You had just arrived and immediately wanted to leave. That isn't fair. \n\nIf you were at work and got a craving, you wouldn't just leave 50 minutes into your shift.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to have everything you crave during your pregnancy the second it pops into your head. You could have waited.\n\nAlso, why couldn\u2019t you go yourself and get it if you wanted it so badly? Why did he need to go with?", "YTA, a craving is something you'd really like to have, not life or death. You acted poorly, like a child, and made both of you go. Why couldn't you go alone?", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't a life or death situation. You could've curbed that craving or waited. And yes, I've had 4 pregnancies with intense cravings so I know where you're coming from. There was no reason to leave just because you \"had\" to have a slushie right then. Also, why didn't you just drive yourself.", "YTA, pregnancy doesn\u2019t automatically make you lose all social grace and personal agency.", "YTA. I've been pregnant, I've had cravings. This is so ridiculous. You could have just gotten one on the way home or possibly just gotten some ice and juice at whoever's house you were at. \n\nCravings aren't a need. No matter how strong, they're a want. And expecting him to leave a family gathering and drive an hour round trip for this is just ridiculous", "YTA.  Just because you get a craving doesn't mean everybody has to drop everything to accommodate you.  If you don't get the slushy, you'll live.  \n\nEven in such a short post, you come off as childish and entitled.\n\nEdit:  I've got 5 offspring.  There's nothing you can tell me about cravings I haven't experienced.", "YTA. Cravings aren\u2019t a necessity\u2014they\u2019re a want. You could definitely have waited.", "Is there a word for pregnant women that\u2019s synonymous with \u201cBridezilla\u201d for brides?\n\nThere should be.\n\nYTA for not being able to wait an hour longer.", "YTA I've had two kids. I get cravings. But you don't get to demand that your BF leave a get together 20 minutes after you have driven 30 minutes to get there. Yes, he put it off and you were oh-so-not-patient for another 30 minutes. SMDH\n\nIt is a big deal and honestly, seems like a total power play. I would really consider how long he's going to stick around for this kind of disregard for him and his wants.", "YTA. The craving could\u2019ve waited. It\u2019s a slushy, not a meal. You wouldn\u2019t be starving if you didn\u2019t get the slushy.", "YTA\n\n> About 30 minutes away.\n\nThat is objectively too far to travel for a snack.", "YTA. Cold sugar water can be replicated without an hour round-trip.", "YTA \n\nYou would have been just fine without a slushee. Calm down and think about how your affect others with your BS", "YTA - there were 2 appropriate options here: go get your own slushie or wait a few more hours to get it. You\u2019re not going to be harmed by holding off a craving for 2hrs. You don\u2019t get to have every single thing you want just because you\u2019re pregnant.", "YTA an hour round trip drive for *slushee* 20 minutes into a family gathering? And you needed a chauffeur? How are you confused about being the asshole? That\u2019s an obviously rude and selfish demand given the circumstances.", "YTA. Cravings are not an immediate *oh my god must have it now or I will perishhhhhhh* need. Grow up.", "Having 4 kids I understand cravings but I do not understand why you couldn\u2019t solve this problem on your own. You literally wanted crushed ice & sugar. Ice cubes & any kind of juice thrown in a blender would work.\n\nYTA\n\nbtw \u2014 it is a big deal to hand your problems to someone else & expect them to fix them. You\u2019re pregnant, not incapable.", "Why didnt you go drive to the store and buy a slushee?  Make your boyfriend leave a family get together because you wanted a slushee.  Sounds like a kid demanding a candy at an inconvenient time.   \n\nA slushee is not a life/death need & your boyfriend is not a slave to obey your every silly whim.  Maybe if you had to inconvenience yourself and drive to buy a slushee, youd learn to curb these cravings.  YTA", "YTA. Very much so.", "YTA, cravings aren\u2019t a medical emergency", "YTA. Your craving could have waited a couple hours, it won\u2019t harm you to not immediately get the snack you want.", "YTA. U absolutely could have waited til the drive home for that slushy. Or you could idk get urself there so he can continue at the get together uninterrupted.  Your pregnancy cravings don\u2019t give you a right to get your way on everything.", "YTA\n\nNot for having a craving, that is out of your control,  but for thinking that your craving is an emergency that must be attended to.", "You\u2019re not T A for getting a craving, but YTA for acting like you have zero control and your cravings should suddenly be the top priority regardless of what else is happening.", "Pregnancy cravings are legit but your timing was awful. Drive 30 mins away after only 20 minutes at the party? I would be pissed too. You could have waited. YTA", "YTA. A craving is a want not a need. You didn\u2019t have an acute case of slushy deficiency, you just felt like one. We\u2019ve all dealt with pregnancy cravings and they\u2019re not fun, but you\u2019re a whole ass adult and more than capable of waiting a few hours to get a slushy.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine being so incredibly self-centered to disrupt a family gathering (your husband\u2019s family at that) due to a craving. Please sincerely apologize to your husband, and do better going forward.", "YTA, I've been pregnant, I've had cravings, they suck, but the world doesn't revolve around them. You shouldn't have to make others leave a party in order to fulfill them. If you wanted one that badly, go get one yourself or find a way to get one delivered to you, but don't put others out when getting a slushie is not an emergency.", "YTA. Come on here.", "YTA the world doesn't revolve around you and your cravings.  You're a fully grown adult who can wait.  Or just drive yourself if it's so important", "YTA. 30 minutes away?!! Pregnancy isn\u2019t an excuse to be a selfish jerk, taking him away from his family for an hour. I promise you\u2019ll survive if you quell your cravings once in a while to be a normal, thoughtful human being.", "YTA. You could've tried to create something slushee like with ice cubes and kool-aid in the kitchen.", "YTA. \n\nCravings are not something you need to fulfill immediately. You could have waited.\n\nEta - I\u2019ve had 2 kids. I had cravings in both pregnancies.", "YTA Wow you couldn\u2019t even wait for an hour at least. I understand cravings but at the point you shouldn\u2019t have even shown up.", "YTA.  Gimmee a break.  So you craved a slushee.  Stop blaming everything on pregnancy and acting like it's some uncontrollable thing.  Also, you're not special because you're pregnant.", "Yta. A craving is a want, not a need. You could have sucked it up for a few hours or gone to get it yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re in for a big lifestyle change when you have to put your wants aside for a child who is 100% reliant on you.", "When I was pregnant, I had such intense cravings for mint that every time I brushed my teeth, I had to talk myself out of eating toothpaste straight from the tube. Needless to say, I managed to avoid eating toothpaste for 9 months. You could've waited until the party was over and got a slushie on the way home. YTA.", "There's nothing dangerous or harmful about ignoring pregnancy cravings and I'd think that, as an adult, you might be able to hold out a few hours and grab a Slushee on your way home. \n\nOr, depending on how pregnant you are, there's probably nothing keeping you from getting in the car and grabbing a Slushee if it's absolutely more urgent than spending more than an hour at your in-laws.\n\nFor me, the verdict is, yeah, kinda TA for not just waiting a little longer.", "YTA \n\nCould you not drive yourself? Are you too pregnant?\n\nEven if you could not drive yourself, asking someone to drive 1 hour round trip for a slushee when you just arrived at a family get together is super obnoxious.", "\"I don't think it's a big deal to leave when I have a craving\" read that 10 times, if you still think you're in the right after it then there is nothing we can do to change you. \n\nJesus, it's not insulin - you'll live. YTA.", "YTA. Your pregnancy is not a disability. You did not need a medical slushee intervention. You should have waited.", "YTA", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA. I'm currently pregnant and wouldn't even think about doing something shitty as making my husband or anybody leave party or whatever because I have a craving. You just want to eat something specific, it's not Like you have to or something would happen to you or baby. If you're that hungry eat anything and have slushy or whatever you are craving when you have a chance (iz certainly can wait few days). Really, really don't get that spoiled and entitled behavior.", "YTA. Drive yourself to get a slushee and come back to the party? You should like you're 19, not almost 30 and about to become a mother", "Definitely the AH. Pregnancy does not make it okay to boss others around to get you frivolous stuff.", "YTA. If it was just 5 minutes away and you offered to pick stuff up while you were out - that\u2019s acceptable. But you stayed at the party for less than an hour before you decided to have you and your husband leave his family for a slushee. It\u2019s literally just crushed ice and sugar, why not have a cold drink at the party to try and quell the craving? I strongly suggest you reevaluate your priorities going forward and learn that not every feeling/craving needs an action", "YTA. I had cravings too. But I could wait for an appropriate time.", "Yeah YTA.  Not for HAVING a craving, but for acting like a toddler about it.   I've been pregnant, cravings can be intense, but they're not emergencies.  You could have waited until later, or even the next day.  I can't even imagine leaving a family event (even a minor one) for a craving.  Get a slushee on the way home.", "YTA and entitled.  The world doesn't revolve around your pregnancy cravings.  My sister is 30w pregnant and gets cravings all the time, but that sure as hell doesn't make her inconvenience people.  If she can't get it, she deals.  Have some grace and common decency.", "YTA. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t make you the queen of everything who gets to demand everyone do whatever you want. Pregnancy cravings are strong I get it, but you\u2019re not going to *die* if you don\u2019t get it. \n\nYou are an adult, you are perfectly capable of enjoying a meal and being a polite guest. When it\u2019s time to go home you can get yourself whatever you want. \n\nYour boyfriend is not your slave. \n\nHe deserves an apology.", "Hooo boy.\n\nYTA OP. I empathize, I really do, but... nope. \n\nLook, I'm in my third trimester. Cravings are a real b\\*tch. You hyper-fixate, you can't think about anything else, you want that one specific thing from that one specific place and damn it you want it now.\n\n... but we're adults. We can't just pout and stamp our feet and whine like toddlers and demand our SOs drop everything and leave planned events/wake up at 4am/etc because WE WANT THE THING AND WE WANT IT NOW (Veruca Salt voice). I have Celiac. Do you have any idea how many things I've craved that I literally CANNOT HAVE without it making me extremely sick? Does it suck? Yup. Do I suck it up? YUP.\n\nIt was not okay for you to pitch a fit and demand your SO leave his family party to get you what amounts to overpriced crushed ice and sugar syrup in a cup.", "YTA. Of course you are. \n\nMost of us had cravings when preggers. Most of us understand it's okay to forgo those cravings. You acted very entitled. You are pregnant, not sick, not disabled. \n\nGet in the freaking car and get your own damned slushie or just, ya know, suck it up and get over the craving.", "Yes, YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a craving, it\u2019s not life or death. You could have waited untill you were done at the party. \n\nNext time ask for some ice to chew on", "I\u2019m pregnant rn and don\u2019t force other people to deal with my cravings right in the moment when it is inconvenient to them, that\u2019s selfish imo. YTA. I hate when people use pregnancy as an excuse to boss people around and act entitled. \nYTA\n\nIf this is just a small glimpse into how you act when you\u2019re pregnant I can\u2019t even imagine how you are the rest of the time. He is probably sick of it already lol", "BuT mY cRaViNgS\u2026 YTA cravings are just that.. cravings .they are not a life altering situation where you should disrupt events or someone\u2019s life to cater to you.", "YTA", "Yta getting a craving is fine.

I also have gestational diabetes and need to control my diet. So I just say no. Cravings are not contractions, cravings are not morning sickness.

You absolutely could have waited a couple of hours to get your frozen sugar water.", "Is this for real? Of course YTA. Grow up.", "YTA. Congrats on your pregnancy but your behavior is 100% selfish and performative.", "You are ridiculous! Craving are wants not needs, yes you could have waited you spoiled brat lol", "YTA \n\nSometimes my pregnancy cravings don't get satisfied because I just don't have time to drive an hour away or I need to cook dinner for my family. Priorities.", "Birth doula here. Try increasing your protein intake. Might help with the sugar cravings. \n\nApart from that, YTA. Why didn\u2019t you go get it on your own?", "YTA. Jeeeesh, lady. I went through pregnancy twice, I had my fair share of craving but I would have never nag my husband about it during a visit to his family. Go and get it for yourself. Pregnancy isnt an illness and absolutely don't give you a free pass to be an annoying ah.", "YTA Cravings are not life or death. You could have waited till you left the party.", "YTA. Take it from a mother of several children\u2026.being pregnant doesn\u2019t turn you into a giant infant yourself. Pregnancy cravings come and go, and you don\u2019t have to pander to every one of them. That\u2019s really immature and indicates you must be the center of attention at all times. Not great for a mom who literally will never be the center of attention again if you\u2019re parenting correctly. Good luck to baby daddy.", "YTA.", "YTA and cravings aren't gonna kill you, would it have hurt you to try and fix something for yourself in the kitchen instead of demanding Sam drive you.  I feel bad for Sam.", "I've been pregnant 3 times and yeah cravings are intense. But most of the time I didn't get to have exactly what I was craving but something similar.. Having something similar to your craving usually curbs the craving.. wouldn't leave a party after 20 mins after a 30 min drive to the party. YtA", "YTA, \n\nI know this may be different but I used to be a really heavy smoker and vaper (nic free now!). When I would go to events where that wasn\u2019t welcomed I would suck it up, even though I had a serious addiction and cravings, sometimes getting a headache. God forbid you can\u2019t wait a couple of hours for a slushee of all things.", "YTA. \n\nYou should have gotten it on the way home, not left specifically to indulge.", "YTA. What is this with some of the pregnant ones that thing craving is a thing that has to be solved immediately? It is not. And you are not entitled to demand from others to stop everything to get you what you want. You wanna something? Go get it yourself! You are pregnant, not ill.\n\nI wouldn't dream of doing something like this to anybody while I was pregnant with my son. I think no decent woman would.\n\nShame on you, really.", "YTA. Learn how to drive a manual in the future because if something more serious happened and you needed to drive it, you\u2019d be stuck. \n\nI know how intense cravings can be but the world doesn\u2019t stop for you because you want a slushie.", "YTA, why do you have to cure your craving right then and there? Why did HE have to take you, you're an adult, sure you're pregnant, but you can drive yourself to get a slushee. You sound like a child using illness to get your way.", "I believe we have a princess here.  She couldn't drive herself?", "YTA - your craving could have waited and you know it. As somebody that's gone through pregnancy twice I'd never do that, nor have I.", "YTA. This is a very good way to become a single parent. You are an adult human who can manage to simultaneously want a slushee and also not get a slushee.

If you weren't able to get this slushie yourself, then you should have waited or gone without. It's a craving, not life or death. I have a feeling you're going to be in a for big surprise after you have the baby and the attention is not on you anymore.", "Why didn\u2019t you make a slushee run?", "YTA", "YTA.

Being pregnant doesn't give you license to behave like a spoiled brat.", "Info: could you not have gotten Uber eats or something?", "YTA - You sound like you are selfish and high maintenance. Good luck to Sam, having to deal with your crap!", "YTA- think you need to take a moment and see that what you did was wrong.

How much do you want to bet the world already revolved around those people before pregnancy? (And whatever is important to them, kids, job, time, opinion, etc).

It was an unreasonable craving but I could quickly resolve it without inconveniencing anyone.\n\n\nThe second time I really wanted some noodles but the wait was 30 minutes and we had to leave soon, and I felt like crying but just took some deep breaths and grabbed something else instead.

Y\u2019all are so funny lmao and I really relate. I love that other women can genuinely see the comedy of crying over a snow cone. I def think it\u2019s important to not impede your loved ones with your cravings but I also think it\u2019s important to see the comedy in it lol. A lot of couples I know have that story they laugh about years later. Like \u201cshe woke me up at 11am craving ice cream and vanilla wafers so I drove to the 24 hour Walmart and got them\u201d and they laugh lol. Do I think it\u2019s necessarily right to make your spouse cater to your cravings? No. Do I think they usually should help with your cravings though because your carrying their spawn that you will risk your life to birth? Yea lmao. I think more people need to consider, will this be a funny story to tell my kids when they\u2019re older? Because really, pregnancy cravings are temporary but the memories you make during that time are eternal and I think we all need to find the humor in craving a specific slushy from a gas station and craving snow cones so bad you cry or craving chocolate milk and crying cause your man brought you a yoo-hoo( comment below mine, it\u2019s hilarious). \n\n\nI do think it\u2019s a tad over board to leave a party for a slushy, but also I think months from now when you\u2019re holding a newborn you\u2019ll never think of this again. It\u2019s a limited issue, an issue you might even miss years from now when you\u2019re all old and gray and you fondly remember your late night slushy escapades with your partner.

We drove an hour for a burger 8pm at night. In the midst of the most important football game in History. And after eating it I spent 3 hours vomiting which made me cry more \ud83d\ude02.

He was gone a total of like 10 mins, and I was sobbing that I'd been left all alone. Hormones are awful when you're pregnant. So I get cravings and the idea that not getting your way would make you cry. Pregnant women are like toddlers. We have so many feelings and not always the correct emotional reaction.

Very very real deal there god I\u2019ve had it with two!", "Unless OP has severe vitamin deficiencies or is only able to eat her cravings (which she did not say) there is never a reason to demand a craving and make her spouse leave a family function just to get her a slushy that has no nutritional value.", "Also I always say\u2026 yeah I\u2019m craving a donut\u2026 but that\u2019s a normal person craving. When I wasn\u2019t pregnant I had cravings. They are normal. I think the intensity for pregnant women comes a lot from that cultural views and overall zeitgeist around pregnancy that pregnant women are crazy and need ice cream at 2 am or something and we cannot control ourselves.", "Some people that crave dirt are also low in iron.

And then that day comes and no longer have that craving lol", "I have a friend who, even when she had good reason to be upset, just didn\u2019t handle things well. I\u2019m more of a listener anyway, so I never minded listening to her rants. She\u2019s a good friend. But this got dialed up to a 10 during her pregnancy, and it got kind of exhausting listening to her and not knowing what she would take the wrong way. The great thing is that between a supportive husband and therapy, she\u2019s become a much more mature adult and is flourishing. \u2764\ufe0f I think her case is pretty rare, cause most people seem to double down on their issues in their 20s, and then they\u2019re pretty much stuck in their ways the rest of their life.", "There\u2019s definitely large chunks of society here and there whether it\u2019s just in their family or more than that who view pregnant women as borderline holy in how delicate and carefully they must be catered to and it all kicks on at that point. \n\nSo some people flip. \n\nLots of pregnant women who have been told and shown their whole life that even if you\u2019re two months pregnant you shouldn\u2019t and cannot do anything physical and should always have your desires met at any moment. \n\n\u201cOh don\u2019t lift those grocery bags, you\u2019re pregnant!\u201d \n\n\u201cYou want pickles and ice cream at 2am even though you don\u2019t have a job and I have to get up for work in 3 hours?

BBQ chicken was a frequent dinner for my 3rd pregnancy.\n\nBut for me the real pregnancy kerfluffle was always the intense pregnancy brain and the aversions.\n\nDuring my 2nd pregnancy, I SOBBED uncontrollably for 3 hours, terrifying all of my male co-workers (I was the only woman in the small company) because I hit a squirrel with my car on the way to the office.  With my 3rd, I was on the way home and ALMOST hit a cat.  The cat was completely uninjured.  I still sobbed the whole way home and terrified my husband when I got there.\n\nIt also became a running joke in the office if I lost my keys while pregnant (I was usually impeccably organized) to check the refrigerator in the break room.  To this day, I cannot explain why that's where my keys ended up.\n\nWe had an amazing Chinese place a few doors down from us and a lot of us got lunch there a few times a week.  I LOVED their food, but after about 10 weeks into my first pregnancy, I would violently throw up if I so much as smelled Chinese food.  Sometimes if the wind was blowing right, I'd spend a whole day being nauseated just from the smell coming down from the restaurant.  The Chinese food aversion did occur with every pregnancy, but would disappear after I gave birth and my kids both love Chinese food, so I honestly don't know what that was all about.", "I cried in Petco because a rat was all alone in the tank.

We were leaving an Alabama Football game and my timing was horrible, but we stopped for a cheeseburger with no ketchup and fries, nothing else.

I refused to leave until I got the burger, so almost an hour later we got in the car, started driving off, and I unwrapped the long-awaited burger. It was COVERED in ketchup.

I was pregnant, not especially by choice, and it ended in adoption, so it was already a rough day. Also, I went into labor while teaching my second period class, the intended sub wanted me to stay and go over the intricacies of the schedule with him though he'd taught in the county til his retirement and had subbed at our school for years, and then he went AWOL, so I drove home in active labor. In that moment, I learned also that certain musical frequencies are Not It when you're in labor.\n\nAnyway, there were the green apples. But after that, I opened my bureau, which is antique. It's three drawers, and on top of that is a cabinet bit with two doors. I opened the doors and leaned in to get some clothes out for the hospital. My mother was in the room, as was my dear friend who was acting as doula for me. I started crying as I tried to stand up because my hair, which was long at the time, had gotten caught in one of the locking mechanisms on the inside of the door. My lovely friend asked what was wrong, and I, through sobs, told her I couldn't get out, I was stuck.\n\nI love her so much. She is warm and kind and understanding, and she rubbed my back and told me it was okay to be a little stuck. She told me I didn't need to come out right now, that I could stay if I needed to, that stuck is an alright place to be sometimes. Which made her total change in response that much the funnier when I wailed, \"No, my *hair* is *stuck!\"* There was an, \"Oh!\", an immediate change of pace, and she untangled my hair while my mother sat on my bed in hysterics.\n\nIt is one of, maybe oddly, the few good memories of that day.
