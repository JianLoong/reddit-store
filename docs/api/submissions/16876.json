You were in the middle of a family event and demanded he either spend an hour driving to get you a slushy, or leave the party after only just getting there. At the very least why couldn\u2019t you go yourself? I understand pregnancy cravings are tough but it\u2019s hardly a medical emergency. If you were in the middle of a work day would you just dip for an hour because you needed a slushy?", "YTA. Someone will have to explain to me in detail why a craving would need to me immediately satisfied to get me to change my view. Why is this a \"leave now\" and not a \"we will get one when we leave\" thing. \n\nCause otherwise you can use \"craving\" as a eject button for any interaction and it beholdens him to your any whim.  \n\nThere has to be a reasonability element to a request.", "**1) You really want something right now.**  \n\\- It's something you can get any day of the week.  \n\\- He wants you to wait 2 hours.\n\n**2) He really wants something right now.**  \n\\- It's something that happens once a week or less.  \n\\- You want him to wait a week or more.\n\n**Why do you win?**\n\nWhy do you get to decide that his want isn't important and he should wait instead of you waiting AND probably also being able to get what you want just 2 hours later?\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nA pregnancy craving isn't a reason to leave a family event. You had just arrived and immediately wanted to leave. That isn't fair. \n\nIf you were at work and got a craving, you wouldn't just leave 50 minutes into your shift.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have to have everything you crave during your pregnancy the second it pops into your head. You could have waited.\n\nAlso, why couldn\u2019t you go yourself and get it if you wanted it so badly? Why did he need to go with?", "YTA, a craving is something you'd really like to have, not life or death. You acted poorly, like a child, and made both of you go. Why couldn't you go alone?", "YTA\n\nThis wasn't a life or death situation. You could've curbed that craving or waited. And yes, I've had 4 pregnancies with intense cravings so I know where you're coming from. There was no reason to leave just because you \"had\" to have a slushie right then. Also, why didn't you just drive yourself.", "YTA, pregnancy doesn\u2019t automatically make you lose all social grace and personal agency.", "YTA. I've been pregnant, I've had cravings. This is so ridiculous. You could have just gotten one on the way home or possibly just gotten some ice and juice at whoever's house you were at. \n\nCravings aren't a need. No matter how strong, they're a want. And expecting him to leave a family gathering and drive an hour round trip for this is just ridiculous", "YTA.  Just because you get a craving doesn't mean everybody has to drop everything to accommodate you.  If you don't get the slushy, you'll live.  \n\nEven in such a short post, you come off as childish and entitled.\n\nEdit:  I've got 5 offspring.  There's nothing you can tell me about cravings I haven't experienced.", "YTA. Cravings aren\u2019t a necessity\u2014they\u2019re a want. You could definitely have waited.", "Is there a word for pregnant women that\u2019s synonymous with \u201cBridezilla\u201d for brides?\n\nThere should be.\n\nYTA for not being able to wait an hour longer.", "YTA I've had two kids. I get cravings. But you don't get to demand that your BF leave a get together 20 minutes after you have driven 30 minutes to get there. Yes, he put it off and you were oh-so-not-patient for another 30 minutes. SMDH\n\nIt is a big deal and honestly, seems like a total power play. I would really consider how long he's going to stick around for this kind of disregard for him and his wants.", "YTA. The craving could\u2019ve waited. It\u2019s a slushy, not a meal. You wouldn\u2019t be starving if you didn\u2019t get the slushy.", "YTA\n\n> About 30 minutes away.\n\nThat is objectively too far to travel for a snack.", "YTA. Cold sugar water can be replicated without an hour round-trip.", "YTA \n\nYou would have been just fine without a slushee. Calm down and think about how your affect others with your BS", "YTA - there were 2 appropriate options here: go get your own slushie or wait a few more hours to get it. You\u2019re not going to be harmed by holding off a craving for 2hrs. You don\u2019t get to have every single thing you want just because you\u2019re pregnant.", "YTA an hour round trip drive for *slushee* 20 minutes into a family gathering? And you needed a chauffeur? How are you confused about being the asshole? That\u2019s an obviously rude and selfish demand given the circumstances.", "YTA. Cravings are not an immediate *oh my god must have it now or I will perishhhhhhh* need. Grow up.", "Having 4 kids I understand cravings but I do not understand why you couldn\u2019t solve this problem on your own. You literally wanted crushed ice & sugar. Ice cubes & any kind of juice thrown in a blender would work.\n\nYTA\n\nbtw \u2014 it is a big deal to hand your problems to someone else & expect them to fix them. You\u2019re pregnant, not incapable.", "Why didnt you go drive to the store and buy a slushee?  Make your boyfriend leave a family get together because you wanted a slushee.  Sounds like a kid demanding a candy at an inconvenient time.   \n\nA slushee is not a life/death need & your boyfriend is not a slave to obey your every silly whim.  Maybe if you had to inconvenience yourself and drive to buy a slushee, youd learn to curb these cravings.  YTA", "YTA. Very much so.", "YTA, cravings aren\u2019t a medical emergency", "YTA. Your craving could have waited a couple hours, it won\u2019t harm you to not immediately get the snack you want.", "YTA. U absolutely could have waited til the drive home for that slushy. Or you could idk get urself there so he can continue at the get together uninterrupted.  Your pregnancy cravings don\u2019t give you a right to get your way on everything.", "YTA\n\nNot for having a craving, that is out of your control,  but for thinking that your craving is an emergency that must be attended to.", "You\u2019re not T A for getting a craving, but YTA for acting like you have zero control and your cravings should suddenly be the top priority regardless of what else is happening.", "Pregnancy cravings are legit but your timing was awful. Drive 30 mins away after only 20 minutes at the party? I would be pissed too. You could have waited. YTA", "YTA. A craving is a want not a need. You didn\u2019t have an acute case of slushy deficiency, you just felt like one. We\u2019ve all dealt with pregnancy cravings and they\u2019re not fun, but you\u2019re a whole ass adult and more than capable of waiting a few hours to get a slushy.", "YTA. I can\u2019t imagine being so incredibly self-centered to disrupt a family gathering (your husband\u2019s family at that) due to a craving. Please sincerely apologize to your husband, and do better going forward.", "YTA, I've been pregnant, I've had cravings, they suck, but the world doesn't revolve around them. You shouldn't have to make others leave a party in order to fulfill them. If you wanted one that badly, go get one yourself or find a way to get one delivered to you, but don't put others out when getting a slushie is not an emergency.", "YTA. Come on here.", "YTA the world doesn't revolve around you and your cravings.  You're a fully grown adult who can wait.  Or just drive yourself if it's so important", "YTA. 30 minutes away?!! Pregnancy isn\u2019t an excuse to be a selfish jerk, taking him away from his family for an hour. I promise you\u2019ll survive if you quell your cravings once in a while to be a normal, thoughtful human being.", "YTA. You could've tried to create something slushee like with ice cubes and kool-aid in the kitchen.", "YTA. \n\nCravings are not something you need to fulfill immediately. You could have waited.\n\nEta - I\u2019ve had 2 kids. I had cravings in both pregnancies.", "YTA Wow you couldn\u2019t even wait for an hour at least. I understand cravings but at the point you shouldn\u2019t have even shown up.", "YTA.  Gimmee a break.  So you craved a slushee.  Stop blaming everything on pregnancy and acting like it's some uncontrollable thing.  Also, you're not special because you're pregnant.", "Yta. A craving is a want, not a need. You could have sucked it up for a few hours or gone to get it yourself.\n\nYou\u2019re in for a big lifestyle change when you have to put your wants aside for a child who is 100% reliant on you.", "When I was pregnant, I had such intense cravings for mint that every time I brushed my teeth, I had to talk myself out of eating toothpaste straight from the tube. Needless to say, I managed to avoid eating toothpaste for 9 months. You could've waited until the party was over and got a slushie on the way home. YTA.", "There's nothing dangerous or harmful about ignoring pregnancy cravings and I'd think that, as an adult, you might be able to hold out a few hours and grab a Slushee on your way home. \n\nOr, depending on how pregnant you are, there's probably nothing keeping you from getting in the car and grabbing a Slushee if it's absolutely more urgent than spending more than an hour at your in-laws.\n\nFor me, the verdict is, yeah, kinda TA for not just waiting a little longer.", "YTA \n\nCould you not drive yourself? Are you too pregnant?\n\nEven if you could not drive yourself, asking someone to drive 1 hour round trip for a slushee when you just arrived at a family get together is super obnoxious.", "\"I don't think it's a big deal to leave when I have a craving\" read that 10 times, if you still think you're in the right after it then there is nothing we can do to change you. \n\nJesus, it's not insulin - you'll live. YTA.", "YTA. Your pregnancy is not a disability. You did not need a medical slushee intervention. You should have waited.", "YTA", "Yta", "YTA", "YTA. I'm currently pregnant and wouldn't even think about doing something shitty as making my husband or anybody leave party or whatever because I have a craving. You just want to eat something specific, it's not Like you have to or something would happen to you or baby. If you're that hungry eat anything and have slushy or whatever you are craving when you have a chance (iz certainly can wait few days). Really, really don't get that spoiled and entitled behavior.", "YTA. Drive yourself to get a slushee and come back to the party? You should like you're 19, not almost 30 and about to become a mother", "Definitely the AH. Pregnancy does not make it okay to boss others around to get you frivolous stuff.", "YTA. If it was just 5 minutes away and you offered to pick stuff up while you were out - that\u2019s acceptable. But you stayed at the party for less than an hour before you decided to have you and your husband leave his family for a slushee. It\u2019s literally just crushed ice and sugar, why not have a cold drink at the party to try and quell the craving? I strongly suggest you reevaluate your priorities going forward and learn that not every feeling/craving needs an action", "YTA. I had cravings too. But I could wait for an appropriate time.", "Yeah YTA.  Not for HAVING a craving, but for acting like a toddler about it.   I've been pregnant, cravings can be intense, but they're not emergencies.  You could have waited until later, or even the next day.  I can't even imagine leaving a family event (even a minor one) for a craving.  Get a slushee on the way home.", "YTA and entitled.  The world doesn't revolve around your pregnancy cravings.  My sister is 30w pregnant and gets cravings all the time, but that sure as hell doesn't make her inconvenience people.  If she can't get it, she deals.  Have some grace and common decency.", "YTA. Being pregnant doesn\u2019t make you the queen of everything who gets to demand everyone do whatever you want. Pregnancy cravings are strong I get it, but you\u2019re not going to *die* if you don\u2019t get it. \n\nYou are an adult, you are perfectly capable of enjoying a meal and being a polite guest. When it\u2019s time to go home you can get yourself whatever you want. \n\nYour boyfriend is not your slave. \n\nHe deserves an apology.", "Hooo boy.\n\nYTA OP. I empathize, I really do, but... nope. \n\nLook, I'm in my third trimester. Cravings are a real b\\*tch. You hyper-fixate, you can't think about anything else, you want that one specific thing from that one specific place and damn it you want it now.\n\n... but we're adults. We can't just pout and stamp our feet and whine like toddlers and demand our SOs drop everything and leave planned events/wake up at 4am/etc because WE WANT THE THING AND WE WANT IT NOW (Veruca Salt voice). I have Celiac. Do you have any idea how many things I've craved that I literally CANNOT HAVE without it making me extremely sick? Does it suck? Yup. Do I suck it up? YUP.\n\nIt was not okay for you to pitch a fit and demand your SO leave his family party to get you what amounts to overpriced crushed ice and sugar syrup in a cup.", "YTA. Of course you are. \n\nMost of us had cravings when preggers. Most of us understand it's okay to forgo those cravings. You acted very entitled. You are pregnant, not sick, not disabled. \n\nGet in the freaking car and get your own damned slushie or just, ya know, suck it up and get over the craving.", "Yes, YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a craving, it\u2019s not life or death. You could have waited untill you were done at the party. \n\nNext time ask for some ice to chew on", "I\u2019m pregnant rn and don\u2019t force other people to deal with my cravings right in the moment when it is inconvenient to them, that\u2019s selfish imo. YTA. I hate when people use pregnancy as an excuse to boss people around and act entitled. \nYTA\n\nIf this is just a small glimpse into how you act when you\u2019re pregnant I can\u2019t even imagine how you are the rest of the time. He is probably sick of it already lol", "BuT mY cRaViNgS\u2026 YTA cravings are just that.. cravings .they are not a life altering situation where you should disrupt events or someone\u2019s life to cater to you.", "YTA", "Yta getting a craving is fine.

I also have gestational diabetes and need to control my diet. So I just say no. Cravings are not contractions, cravings are not morning sickness.

You absolutely could have waited a couple of hours to get your frozen sugar water.", "Is this for real? Of course YTA. Grow up.", "YTA. Congrats on your pregnancy but your behavior is 100% selfish and performative.", "You are ridiculous! Craving are wants not needs, yes you could have waited you spoiled brat lol", "YTA \n\nSometimes my pregnancy cravings don't get satisfied because I just don't have time to drive an hour away or I need to cook dinner for my family. Priorities.", "Birth doula here. Try increasing your protein intake. Might help with the sugar cravings. \n\nApart from that, YTA. Why didn\u2019t you go get it on your own?", "YTA. Jeeeesh, lady. I went through pregnancy twice, I had my fair share of craving but I would have never nag my husband about it during a visit to his family. Go and get it for yourself. Pregnancy isnt an illness and absolutely don't give you a free pass to be an annoying ah.", "YTA Cravings are not life or death. You could have waited till you left the party.", "YTA. Take it from a mother of several children\u2026.being pregnant doesn\u2019t turn you into a giant infant yourself. Pregnancy cravings come and go, and you don\u2019t have to pander to every one of them. That\u2019s really immature and indicates you must be the center of attention at all times. Not great for a mom who literally will never be the center of attention again if you\u2019re parenting correctly. Good luck to baby daddy.", "YTA.", "YTA and cravings aren't gonna kill you, would it have hurt you to try and fix something for yourself in the kitchen instead of demanding Sam drive you.  I feel bad for Sam.", "I've been pregnant 3 times and yeah cravings are intense. But most of the time I didn't get to have exactly what I was craving but something similar.. Having something similar to your craving usually curbs the craving.. wouldn't leave a party after 20 mins after a 30 min drive to the party. YtA", "YTA, \n\nI know this may be different but I used to be a really heavy smoker and vaper (nic free now!). When I would go to events where that wasn\u2019t welcomed I would suck it up, even though I had a serious addiction and cravings, sometimes getting a headache. God forbid you can\u2019t wait a couple of hours for a slushee of all things.", "YTA. \n\nYou should have gotten it on the way home, not left specifically to indulge.", "YTA. What is this with some of the pregnant ones that thing craving is a thing that has to be solved immediately? It is not. And you are not entitled to demand from others to stop everything to get you what you want. You wanna something? Go get it yourself!

Learn how to drive a manual in the future because if something more serious happened and you needed to drive it, you\u2019d be stuck. \n\nI know how intense cravings can be but the world doesn\u2019t stop for you because you want a slushie.", "YTA, why do you have to cure your craving right then and there? Why did HE have to take you, you're an adult, sure you're pregnant, but you can drive yourself to get a slushee. You sound like a child using illness to get your way.", "I believe we have a princess here.  She couldn't drive herself?", "YTA - your craving could have waited and you know it. As somebody that's gone through pregnancy twice I'd never do that, nor have I.", "YTA. This is a very good way to become a single parent. You are an adult human who can manage to simultaneously want a slushee and also not get a slushee.

You're pregnant, not disabled. If you weren't able to get this slushie yourself, then you should have waited or gone without. It's a craving, not life or death.

Cause it feels to me like you didn't and just wanted an excuse to leave.", "YTA learn to drive it or drive your car since your cravings are so show stopping", "Poor Veruca Salt, it\u2019s not her fault! She wanted that slushee now! She *would* have gotten her own slushee, but no one ever taught her how to work the machine! She already waited a whole 30 minutes from when the craving popped into her head, why can\u2019t anyone understand?\n\nETA: everyone telling you to learn how to drive stick is missing the point. You need to learn to delay your gratification and your outsized sense of entitlement. Many people do not know how to drive manual transmission vehicles, but still manage to not be assholes to their loved ones.", "Did you have a phone? Could you uber eats or door dash? Are you a child who thinks a craving overrides everything? YTA", "It's not hard, you should learn.  YTA.  You could've simply waited a few hours.  There is absolutely nothing healthy in a slushie so it wasn't something your body wanted for the health of your child.  Given that you're about to have  a baby, it's time for you to be a grownup.", "Omg. That\u2019s such a funny excuse \ud83e\udd2d\ud83d\ude02\n\nI really thought those were made up memes \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nSorry, almost sorry. This is just so hilarious to me.", "Way to grind his gears though. YTA.", "Seems like that is a YOU problem.", "9 months pregnant here! This is true! You can easily combat them mentally and get your fix later.", "They aren't dangerous to ignore but for both pregancies my mom apparently kept craving chocolate milk (she can't stand the taste of regular milk), she was constantly low on calcium and that was her body's way to make up for it.\nI've never been pregnant but often have low bloodpressure. I know now that if I keep craving salt chances are my bloodpressure has been dropping below what's normal even for me.\nIt never hurts to double check your cravings to understand your body better :)", "This is the one \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "Or Pregzilla..", "Were you low iron by any chance?", "There is when you\u2019re 5\u20191\u201d and your legs are too short to reach the pedals without your belly pressing the steering wheel \ud83d\ude02\n\nBut I can\u2019t help but assume that\u2019s not the case here", "Eh I am not going to pretend like I know everyone's situations and neither should you.", "I cried over ice cream on Sunday \ud83e\udd23 Hubs found a gf ice cream place but we had to wait until today to go. SO worth the wait!", "I craved sushi\u2026 couldn\u2019t have that either.. and what do ya know.. I survived without sushi (and had it after the baby was born).. \n\nYTA op", "So you\u2019re saying that if she doesn\u2019t get that flavored crushed up ice, her brain is going to shrink?", "Oh yea, her body is totally going to start self cannibalizing from lack of nutrients if she doesn\u2019t get a slushie. \n\nPure fructose and food coloring. It does the body good!", "Just no. \n\nShe isn\u2019t craving a freaking slushee due to some calorie or nutrient deficiency. It was a want.\n\nNo one is saying pregnancy isn\u2019t demanding on the body. But this is nothing other than \u201cI wanted a slushee and demanded to get it because I\u2019m the pregnant center of attention.\u201d", "Lolololololol yeah, no. I\u2019ve been pregnant and I fully understand cravings. There is absolutely nothing in a slushie that\u2019s going to provide any type of nutrients the baby needs. Try again.", "What?", "That seems like a bad idea tbh", "I must have really short limbs, or have been carrying weirdly, I couldn't drive around month 7 or 8 because I couldn't reach my brake pedal with the seat far enough back to not have my bump on the steering wheel.", "How do you not like tater tots? The fuck", "I cried when my toddler dropped my container of white rice when I was like 35 weeks and going to give birth in a few weeks. \nI was so upset and crying and yelling. \nMy boyfriend was like it\u2019s not that big of a deal, and then went do you want me to go get you some more and I was just so emotional I went into the kitchen and made broccoli cheddar rice-a-roni which my two year old ate very well. \ud83d\ude39", "Omg \ud83e\udd23 that\u2019s so funny but also I\u2019m sorry LOL", "Yes!  Let\u2019s jump to the most extreme example.", "I\u2019m sure everyone is exactly like you.  Because every pregnancy is identical,  an no one has pre existing mental health issue ever.", "It\u2019s called compromise, she\u2019s doing the heavy lifting and is now dealing with intense cravings carrying both of your child. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s wrong to show a bit more understanding and attention to your pregnant partner", "And a craving for sugary chemical liquids isn\u2019t good for the baby so it\u2019s more of a desire than an actual \u2018pregnancy craving\u2019 which is when your body requires a specific nutrient/s for the baby\u2019s development and loudly asks you to eat something which contains this nutrient. If she\u2019s craving pure sugar hits she needs to be careful of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia", "Of course. Which is why I said YTA. But I just thought the person above me's \"breakdown\" of the situation was rather misleading. OP and her husband are not on equal footing at the moment. Her pregnancy is very relevant to the conversation, and she should be given deference in some situations because of it.", "Because OP's instant gratification is more important to her than the wants or feelings of her husband and by extension his family.\n\nYTA, OP.", "She was answering a question. Like yeah, she was in the wrong, but this whole thread feels like people taking the opportunity to bash on this woman.", "*unless* the car has a \u201chill holder\u201d where you can push the brake a little extra when stopped on a hill and you don\u2019t have to worry about rolling backwards when you\u2019re starting.

But I wouldn't make my husband leave a party to drive me 30 minutes one way to get me a snack, either.", "eh idk how to drive manual. i think a lot of people in the u.s. dont. i tried to learn when i was a teen but i was practicing with my dad\u2019s car and kept stalling it so he got nervous about me damaging it and the lessons ended. it has literally never come up since then.", ">Preggosaurus rex\\*", "Aye with both my wee girl and wee boy, doctors gave me iron tablets but they didn't seem to help.", "It\u2019s a better idea than delivering a baby at home or in my office alone. L&D isn\u2019t like on television. Your contractions start out gradually increasing in frequency, duration, and pain. When you realize your contractions are regular and moving toward delivery, it\u2019s not uncommon to drive yourself.", "One of the lunch ladies I worked with went into labor. She finished milking all the cows on her farm, then drove herself to the hospital.", "It is, if you crash the car whilst in labour there\u2019s no way insurance is paying you out because you were driving whilst impaired! Not to mention you\u2019re risking the lives of people around you", "For real?!? I guess I never thought about that. I am pretty tall at 5\u20199\u201d so yeah\u2026.that could be a thing.", "I had the same problem, my car at the time was quite small and I\u2019m barely over 5 feet so my stomach was touching the wheel by 32 weeks!

The pregnancy stories I have are crazy and almost all of them revolve around food.", "Lol... I asked him several more times to pick up gravy (who knows why ... so weird) he said \u201cokay but maybe you should wait a little bit & try eating plain mashed potatoes\u201d. He wasn\u2019t wrong. The craving always passed. You couldn\u2019t pay me to eat jarred gravy now lol!!", "Don't use pregnancy as an excuse to be an entitled brat.\n\nPre existing mental issues are maybe the reason people behave irrational, don't you think?\n\nI hate the misogyny of treating pregnant women like kids, wtf.", "She chose to be pregnant. Dropping everything for a pregnancy craving is stupid and just seems controlling.", "And you were going to die if you  had to wait an hour or two to get one????

The car I normally drove was fairly small though. I was also pregnant well before things like adjustable height seats were common.", "Booooooooooo", "Get out", "Youre actually insane", "From 30 minutes away?
