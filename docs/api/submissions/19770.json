There is so much more acceptance (at least of the L, G and B parts of LGBT) than there was a generation ago, from marriage to business to culture. The problem isn't the \"people intent on being victims,\" as you describe them. The people who are actually dividing us are the bigots, not those standing up to bigotry."]}
