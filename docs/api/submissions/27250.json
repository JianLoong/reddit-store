I can't even imagine one of my siblings doing it to my parents, or my parents doing it to one another.\n\nBack to my girlfriend (24F): I love her very much, but sometimes she does strange things to food that for whatever reason I can't explain make me just feel unappreciated.\n\nFor instance, I bought protein bars coated in dark chocolate. I shared them with her. Later I saw a bunch of them \"naked\" in a plastic bag. She'd cut off the coating, and leave the center. She said she doesn't like the center but the chocolate is tasty. I suggested I'd buy her dark chocolate since this is a waste but she said she likes that specific chocolate, and I could eat the center if I'd like. No, I don't want to eat just the center, I want to enjoy the entire protein bar.. this gives me Cartman and KFC episode vibes.\n\nAnother example from today - I made chicken curry. She had it before, and she said she really liked it. Today, I walk in to her washing the cooked chicken bits and rinsing them in water. I was really confused. She started laughing and said \"don't look at me\". I didn't find it funny, it was quite offensive. It was a waste of food and just disrespect to my cooking. This started an argument which led to her crying.\n\nThere have been more examples similar to those which I can't remember for now.\n\nShe has the right to eat her food in any way she wants it, but this doesn't change the fact that I find it upsetting when she wastes food and messes with my cooking. I asked her how would she feel if I did the same with her cooking, to which she responded with \"I'd want you to enjoy the food in the way you like it\" (no, not really.

If she doesn't like the chicken in sauce, she can make her own plain chicken.  If she JUST wants the chocolate off the bars, she can go buy herself chocolate.", "NTA\n\nWashing the sauce off the chicken you cooked or eating just the chocolate off a bunch of your protein bars is just very ill mannered. If you were raised better than this and find these small things disrespectful but she doesn't understand the problem, this is only likely to lead to more disagreements down the line. \n\nWhat happens if you end up having children together, will you be happy with her parenting them in this same way? If not, perhaps you aren't all that compatible as a serious couple.", "NTA\n\nIf she just told you she didn't like the food or just didn't eat, she wouldn't waste it. Instead she makes these modifications when she could have just asked for the thing on its own. For example, when she literally started WASHING the chicken, she could have just said 'I don't like this, can you make some chicken on its own?'. You should gently tell her to please not waste food. However, I can understand how you two probably grew up in different households but she still shouldn't waste or disrespect the food that YOU made.", "NTA. She just needs to make her own food, this type of habit is annoying.", "NTA. Modifications aren't the end of the world, but your girlfriend's extent of them is strange.\n\nAren't protein bars a bit costly? If she's going to only eat the chocolate off of them, that'd be annoying. Just have her find a similar chocolate. She's doing too much.\n\nAs for the curry, again, modifications aren't the end of the world. But **washing the chicken off?** That's crazy. Unless she specifically asked you not to cook the chicken or something and she had it set for another dish, it's wild to just destroy what you made like that.\n\nEspecially when she can't take even a mild dose of the same treatment back.", "NTA... washing the WHAT off the chicken curry? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe only way that would even be remotely considered a normal thing to do is if she has some sort of intolerance or allergy to it, and it doesn't seem like that is the case here. I have genuinely never in my life seen anyone wash the spice off a curried meat unless they were feeding it to a toddler who wanted the same meal as the family (in which case it would be pretty normal in the interests of avoiding a tantrum etc).\n\nAlso the protein bar thing is just rude because firstly that's gross, secondly the coating is the only thing that make protein bars tolerable, and thirdly it is very strange to store the \"centres\" and expect you to eat them... honestly I feel it would genuinely be less weird if she simply ate the bits she wanted and threw the rest away. I mean I'd still think she should buy her own, or like... buy a chocolate bar or something, but it's still less weird than storing chunks of protein in a jar. \n\nAlso genuinely very confused about the other commenrs here advocating for her \"right\" to do this because \"she could be neurodivergent\" or \"it's her choice how to eat her food\". Like yeah it is, but if she doesn't like spice she can just not eat the curry, and if she loves the protein bar coating so much she can just throw the center away instead of performing surgery on it. Also baffled by the commenter claiming that throwing the centre of a protein bad away is more \"wasteful\" compared to asking your partner to eat it... I'm sorry, are half eaten protein bars normally donated to food banks? Will OP eating a chunk of nasty solid protein every day solve world hunger? It is bizzare logic, sorry!\n\nETA: I am finding really odd how so many people are just... diagnosing her with an eating disorder? For liking a chocolate coating and disliking spice? I'm sorry, but as someone who has had an ED for over a decade, not every weird/rude/wasteful food habit is a symptom of a life threatening disorder.", "NTA --- This is where you suggest that she start cooking for herself so she can have her food how she likes it.", "NTA, there is work on the communication skills probably on both sides because this isn't the kind of conversations that should end in tears.\n\nBut being clear on the fact that you don't want food wasted is not an asshole point of view", "NTA. Who wants to eat parts of snacks that someone has already touched all over? Your GF is kinda gross in that respect. The washing of the chicken is absolutely rude.

If they are hers she can do anything to them, I make diners for my family, my husband put bbq sauce on the meat on his plate, I do not take offense because that is what he wants and how he wants to eat it! He makes me food and with my health issues sometimes I can\u2019t eat it, he doesn\u2019t get offended he actually feel\u2019s upset and asks if he can make something for me, I say no most of the time because it\u2019s me who can\u2019t eat it and I make something else.

She needs to recognise that some of her choices can be served better by being more responsible.\n\nWhat you are doing is also problematic. while you can treat your portions of food as you like, you cannot decide how other people should go about consuming theirs. If no one ever modified their food, cooking would be a stagnant skill. Modification is absolutely a valid choice, and deserves respect.

It's not disrespectful to what I've cooked... it's him making a meal more enjoyable for himself.", "She's not just wasting food but acting like a spoilt brat. This also sounds like a control issue.

OP liked his food the way it was, so it wasn\u2019t wasted effort.\n\nTaking offense is optional.", "You\u2019re the one who\u2019s looking at anything people say as \u201cmaking excuses\u201d for her.", "nowhere did the person you\u2019re responding to say that this behavior was okay, just offered a reason as to why it may be happening. and if it is because of a mental disorder or possibly neurodivergence, the behavior likely won\u2019t change, or at least not easily. that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s an excuse, we all know mental health issues don\u2019t excuse bad behavior from people, but they do offer explanations (and sometimes solutions) for said behavior.", ">It's kind of an interesting thought experiment because I would be okay with someone scraping the chocolate off the granola bar and just eating the granola bar, but not the opposite.\n\nBecause in one of them, you're still consuming the majority of the item, not wasting it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLike, someone who scrapes frosting off a cake but eats the cake is fine cause they're STILL eating the cake, but if someone ONLY ate the frosting off the cake and tossed the cake...it's the CORE of the dish that's going to waste. And in this case, she did it to an entire box of granola bars....so she ate ONLY the frosting of an entire cake and left just the cake for her BF....or ate the RE in every single OREO and left her BF the OOs only.", "Wrong. He didn't GIVE her the granola bars. He offered to share the granola bars and in return she ate just the chocolate off all of them. She is ungrateful entitled and wasteful. And yeah, he's \"food insecure\" the same way in the same way you'd be \"financially insecure\" if I set all your cash on fire. Would you be upset at such braindead asinine behavior? Careful you don't want to be \"insecure.\" This is an NTA and any claim otherwise is pure misandry by feeling that a woman is entitled not to be a decent, grateful person."]}
