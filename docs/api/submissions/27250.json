I can't even imagine one of my siblings doing it to my parents, or my parents doing it to one another.\n\nBack to my girlfriend (24F): I love her very much, but sometimes she does strange things to food that for whatever reason I can't explain make me just feel unappreciated.\n\nFor instance, I bought protein bars coated in dark chocolate. I shared them with her. Later I saw a bunch of them \"naked\" in a plastic bag. She'd cut off the coating, and leave the center. She said she doesn't like the center but the chocolate is tasty. I suggested I'd buy her dark chocolate since this is a waste but she said she likes that specific chocolate, and I could eat the center if I'd like. No, I don't want to eat just the center, I want to enjoy the entire protein bar.. this gives me Cartman and KFC episode vibes.\n\nAnother example from today - I made chicken curry. She had it before, and she said she really liked it. Today, I walk in to her washing the cooked chicken bits and rinsing them in water. I was really confused. She started laughing and said \"don't look at me\". I didn't find it funny, it was quite offensive. It was a waste of food and just disrespect to my cooking. This started an argument which led to her crying.\n\nThere have been more examples similar to those which I can't remember for now.\n\nShe has the right to eat her food in any way she wants it, but this doesn't change the fact that I find it upsetting when she wastes food and messes with my cooking. I asked her how would she feel if I did the same with her cooking, to which she responded with \"I'd want you to enjoy the food in the way you like it\" (no, not really.

If she doesn't like the chicken in sauce, she can make her own plain chicken.  If she JUST wants the chocolate off the bars, she can go buy herself chocolate.", "NTA\n\nWashing the sauce off the chicken you cooked or eating just the chocolate off a bunch of your protein bars is just very ill mannered. If you were raised better than this and find these small things disrespectful but she doesn't understand the problem, this is only likely to lead to more disagreements down the line. \n\nWhat happens if you end up having children together, will you be happy with her parenting them in this same way? If not, perhaps you aren't all that compatible as a serious couple.", "NTA\n\nIf she just told you she didn't like the food or just didn't eat, she wouldn't waste it. Instead she makes these modifications when she could have just asked for the thing on its own. For example, when she literally started WASHING the chicken, she could have just said 'I don't like this, can you make some chicken on its own?'. You should gently tell her to please not waste food. However, I can understand how you two probably grew up in different households but she still shouldn't waste or disrespect the food that YOU made.", "NTA. She just needs to make her own food, this type of habit is annoying.", "NTA. Modifications aren't the end of the world, but your girlfriend's extent of them is strange.\n\nAren't protein bars a bit costly? If she's going to only eat the chocolate off of them, that'd be annoying. Just have her find a similar chocolate. She's doing too much.\n\nAs for the curry, again, modifications aren't the end of the world. But **washing the chicken off?** That's crazy. Unless she specifically asked you not to cook the chicken or something and she had it set for another dish, it's wild to just destroy what you made like that.\n\nEspecially when she can't take even a mild dose of the same treatment back.", "NTA... washing the WHAT off the chicken curry? \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe only way that would even be remotely considered a normal thing to do is if she has some sort of intolerance or allergy to it, and it doesn't seem like that is the case here. I have genuinely never in my life seen anyone wash the spice off a curried meat unless they were feeding it to a toddler who wanted the same meal as the family (in which case it would be pretty normal in the interests of avoiding a tantrum etc).\n\nAlso the protein bar thing is just rude because firstly that's gross, secondly the coating is the only thing that make protein bars tolerable, and thirdly it is very strange to store the \"centres\" and expect you to eat them... honestly I feel it would genuinely be less weird if she simply ate the bits she wanted and threw the rest away. I mean I'd still think she should buy her own, or like... buy a chocolate bar or something, but it's still less weird than storing chunks of protein in a jar. \n\nAlso genuinely very confused about the other commenrs here advocating for her \"right\" to do this because \"she could be neurodivergent\" or \"it's her choice how to eat her food\". Like yeah it is, but if she doesn't like spice she can just not eat the curry, and if she loves the protein bar coating so much she can just throw the center away instead of performing surgery on it. Also baffled by the commenter claiming that throwing the centre of a protein bad away is more \"wasteful\" compared to asking your partner to eat it... I'm sorry, are half eaten protein bars normally donated to food banks? Will OP eating a chunk of nasty solid protein every day solve world hunger? It is bizzare logic, sorry!\n\nETA: I am finding really odd how so many people are just... diagnosing her with an eating disorder? For liking a chocolate coating and disliking spice? I'm sorry, but as someone who has had an ED for over a decade, not every weird/rude/wasteful food habit is a symptom of a life threatening disorder.", "NTA --- This is where you suggest that she start cooking for herself so she can have her food how she likes it.", "NTA, there is work on the communication skills probably on both sides because this isn't the kind of conversations that should end in tears.\n\nBut being clear on the fact that you don't want food wasted is not an asshole point of view", "NTA. Who wants to eat parts of snacks that someone has already touched all over? Your GF is kinda gross in that respect. The washing of the chicken is absolutely rude.

If they are hers she can do anything to them, I make diners for my family, my husband put bbq sauce on the meat on his plate, I do not take offense because that is what he wants and how he wants to eat it! He makes me food and with my health issues sometimes I can\u2019t eat it, he doesn\u2019t get offended he actually feel\u2019s upset and asks if he can make something for me, I say no most of the time because it\u2019s me who can\u2019t eat it and I make something else.

She needs to recognise that some of her choices can be served better by being more responsible.\n\nWhat you are doing is also problematic. while you can treat your portions of food as you like, you cannot decide how other people should go about consuming theirs. If no one ever modified their food, cooking would be a stagnant skill. Modification is absolutely a valid choice, and deserves respect.

It's not disrespectful to what I've cooked... it's him making a meal more enjoyable for himself.", "She's not just wasting food but acting like a spoilt brat. This also sounds like a control issue.

She should be able to enjoy things in her own way, maybe she should just throw the centres in the food waste bin if OP doesn\u2019t want to eat them.", "It\u2019s also very normal ARFID behaviour. \n\nNot all eating disorders are the same.\n\nFrankly most ED advice doesn\u2019t fit for us because the processes going on in the background are completely different.", "Eating the chocolate off protein bars and leaving just the inner bar is rude and greedy", "I dont know that there's really a way to \"fix\" this as in changing her to behave differently. I think more likely it will require a mind shift on your side. She's probably not doing this AT you, her actions have components of compulsive/impulsive behavior (and possibly a hint of shame?) and most likely she would choose differently if her wiring would let her. You two are different people and were raised differently and both made it to adulthood, so wouldn't dwell on that. Try coming at this from a place of sympathy for your girlfriend and not anger -- if you ever have kids, you'll be much better prepared to handle their food issues.", "The reality is I don't think she will until SHE'S the one having to make food that ends up half wasted and is throwing money and time in the trash. Regardless of the reason, she's incredibly childish and disrespectful of the cost of food or the time people put into making it. I would have a REALLY hard time making food for someone who acted that way. You want me to go through the trouble of making chicken and vegetable curry just so you can rinse the fucking curry off into the sink? Or spend my money buying protein bars just so she can just cut off the chocolate and leave me the filling inside (that excuse of \"but I like THIS chocolate\" is fucking absurd)? Absolutely not.", "They're the same thing. ADD is an outdated term. It's all ADHD now.", "they're the same thing but this is not remotely related to ADHD and im slightly insulted to have something in common with your girlfriend who is just an asshole", "Hmm, so it could be an impulse control thing: she wants the chocolate NOW but not the bar so she gets it off the bar instead of buying just chocolate. She wants chicken without sauce NOW so she gets it out of the curry rather than cooking the raw chicken from the fridge. \n\nThis isn't meant to be an excuse, but a possible explanation for you (and her). She can still learn to control these impulsives, it might just be (a lot) harder for her if indeed she does have ADHD. \n\nDoes she act on her impulses a lot in general?", "It was a definite thing when I grew up in the 80's to be told eat what you are given or don't eat at all.  I often chose not to eat, OP chose the opposite.  I have chosen not to raise my family this way because frankly controlling food is a great way to cause physical and mental health issues. His girlfriend is still eating very strangely whether people grew up like op and I did or not.", "Have you shown her the Cartman video?", "This explains a lot. She was spoiled and has developed weird habits. Possibly eating disorder related too, though. I also grew up very poor though and this would drive me insane. \n\nIt sounds like she doesn't understand the value of what you're buying and doing for her. She (her parents lol) can buy her own protein bars and eat just the chocolate. She can make her own plain ass chicken.", "Not eating it is even more wasteful. People put sauce, salt, and pepper on bland food. Some people like mustard, some like ketchup, some like both. You mean no one is supposed to customize their own food? If the burger comes plain, but they like extra ketchup they should not eat it?", "100% this. She's N T A for having a preference for certain foods. She 's Y T A for doing it at others' expense and effort.", "I am relatively picky eater and I am pretty lazy. I still never would imagine doing this. If I don't like, I either fix it minimally (e.g. adding salt/pepper), or I don't eat it at all. At best I pick out only minimal part, e.g. quite big onions from small serving of food.\n\nNTA, this is seriously wrong.", "I had the same thought and also have a history of ed. \n\ne.g. I used to eat just the caramel top off of Mars bars as lunch as a treat sometimes (\ud83d\ude2c), but I bought them and I didn't expect someone else to eat the rest!", "Link please!", "Did we ever get an update on this?\n\nEdit : checked the post and turns out op's boyfriend was basically a serial killer. Believable.", "OMG, the both sound insufferable.", "Frankly, the chicken is just the vessel to get the curry into my mouth.", "If she didn't want curry chicken, she should do another thing to eat. But wash a already cooked chicken and eat later is Crazy...\nAnd she doesn't like protein bar, she likes chocolate so she should buy chocolate and let her boyfriend's protein bar alone!", "The deal with the chicken is not so much that it's wasteful. It's that it's insulting", "i\u2019m stuck on the way she wasted OP\u2019s money by scraping off the chocolate for herself and leaving naked granola bars for him as if she did him a favor lmao.\n\nthat\u2019s beyond not appreciating the cost of things imo, it\u2019s not caring about OP\u2019s feelings at all because she thinks it\u2019s perfectly fine to waste his food and leave him \u201cscraps\u201d because she thinks she\u2019s entitled to taking the best parts for herself. unreal.", "Agreed, especially based on the chocolate story. Those chocolate protein bars aren't cheap!", "Maybe she has some disordered eating tendancies", "In the OP he mentions that she likes his curry.  So she's just being a shit.", "Personally, that still sounds disgusting to me. I can't imagine the texture stays enjoyable. I'm certainly not going to test it. \n\nJust make a batch without sauce or plain seasoning only on the side.", "Probably because their own families are still giving them shit for failing to manage their symptoms in childhood.", "My partner has ARFID. They wouldn't do this. It's not an excuse to be rude.\n\nEdit: Also; as my experiences with people who have ARFID, there's usually a complete avoidance of food they won't/can't eat. If I had protein bars and my partner wouldn't eat the protein portion, the fact that the chocolate is touching the protein would make it inedible to them? Sauce gets INSIDE meat products, so rinsing it off doesn't remove the flavor completely - again, not something typical of ARFID. They don't just 'prefer' to not eat their rejected foods, it is an avoidance of them, which also results in avoiding food that has touched what they avoid. Her eating the curry and then changing it later doesn't seem ARFID to me.", "Honestly! The combination of the bar and the chocolate layer makes the flavour - it's super rude to tell OP to \"here, you can just eat the part I don't like\". If she doesn't like the bars she should just go find a chocolate bar that she does like.", "Ja who tf does that", "Sensory issues are totally an adhd thing. What are you on about?", "This sounds familiar. She'd suddenly become hungry and want to eat ASAP, like she can't wait even 5 minutes to make something, while at other times she can spend hours patiently focused on doing one thing.", "She wants the specific chocolate and can\u2019t find one in the store that tastes the same.", "That\u2019s not what OP is saying. He says this is fine. His gf on the other hand finds this insulting yet does worse to OP. What she is doing is wasteful - wasting half the bars, wasting OP\u2019s time in cooking a curry just to rinse off the curry. If she said she didn\u2019t like it he\u2019d prob avoid cooking it for her but she claimed to like it. She\u2019s TA, and the situation is just petty really.", "How can you compare adding condiments to throwing away essential components of the dish?", "She washed the curry off the chicken in the sink and cutting the chocolate off of protein bars and tossing the cores aside. This isn't a condiment deal, this is outright stated in the post.\n\nAlso if it's not eaten it can be tubbed up and eaten tomorrow as leftovers.", "It's not an issue of taste, it's an issue of **wasting food and time**. The comparison to the South Park episode is an apt one; would you be okay with someone taking fried chicken you bought or made yourself and only eating the skin and leaving the rest of the plain uncoated chicken for someone else to choke down? Or just throw away, like she did with the curry sauce?", "[bf won't make noodles the way I like](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/ovtegGDNXX)", "The chocolate is indeed not the same as a chocolate bar. Its like the top of a muffin. You can't replicate that. You need a full muffin for it.", "He initially complained it was wasteful. I fail to see how it is insulting----she ate it before, she liked it, she just didn't want to eat it with the sauce a second (third?) time. Big deal. If that's all it takes for him to be insulted, he needs to grow a thicker skin.", ">...leave him \u201cscraps\u201d because she thinks she\u2019s entitled to taking the best parts for herself...\n\nThis is the red flag.\n\nThis is the mark of a completely self-centered person.  At 2 years old, you expect this behaviour.  By 24, a person should have some empathy for the other people around them and behave accordingly.\n\nDude, Run.\n\nOr spend your life surviving on scraps and I don't just mean food.

Its just nice when they complement eachother, like one likes to scrape the cheese off pizza and the other likes to eat only the cheese, or one (my wife) doesn't like the \"ends\" of things like chicken tenders while I said that's the crispy best part, whatever I'll take your scraps.", "I'm not condoning what she did, but the texture does stay the same if you just quickly wash the sauce off and don't soak the chicken piece in water. I've had to do this once when there was way too much salt in the sauce I made, but I didn't have any replacement chicken to cook. So I had to rinse the chicken piece and redo the sauce.", "Yes food waste is a thing for people with ADHD. But it is in terms of forgetting that there is meal prepped food in the fridge or forgetting to even put the food in the fridge so it\u2019s going bad and also that you don\u2019t want to eat what you have at home, because it won\u2019t hit the spot. But you don\u2019t waste food on purpose and just don\u2019t care. You mentioned that you spoke with her and she doesn\u2019t see the problem.

I feel like this is a situation that *should\"* be easily resolved with a conversation. If she wants/prefers plain chicken she should just say so. But the whole protein bar thing is ridiculous.

Any recommendations on where to start?", "Never heard of it had to google it.\n\nNot exactly. I don't do weird stuff and cut out the middle. I'll eat the whole thing. I just think the crispy ends are the best part so I'll call her weird but sure I'll eat those scraps. Especially because she's really generous with what is considered \"ends\" and wastes like 2/3 of it. I'm not eating her ravaged french fry ends though she can toss that.\n\nIts my kids that are more like that. My daughter always scrapes the cheese off pizza and eats the saucy doughy part. Our third child does the opposite and just eats the cheese off. So we just give one the others' scraps. Bonus for stuffed crust; while she doesn't like the cheese on the pizza she does eat the cheese out of the crust. Meanwhile that same other child likes the crispy crust. They really go well together to leave no waste with pizza. They do the same thing with her favorite frozen meals. She sometimes prefers a specific frozen meal but doesn't want like the chicken and broccoli or whatever is mixed in it. So I pick all those out and give those to him in a bowl."]}
