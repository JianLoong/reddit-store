So I decided to tell her that I can't sleep when she was in my room but she just said that it's not her fault and that if my parent just got her a better mattress that everything would be fine. I told her since it's my room that I get to decided if she sleep in my room or not and then she goes on to tell my parent that I'm the asshole for not letting her sleep in my room and then I end getting in trouble or told to get over it and then end up sleeping so horribly.

Not even a little bit. It\u2019s honestly shocking to me that your sister and your parent think she is entitled to invade your privacy like that. She can buy a mattress topper that will make her bed more comfortable for the time being, but sleeping in your bed should be a non starter unless you consent to it.", "NTA.

She's an adult human being, with agency and control over her actions. She didn't trip up and land asleep in your bed. She didn't get confused coming back from the bathroom in the middle of the night.

No matter how bad her mattress is, it can't be any more uncomfortable than sleeping in the same bed with someone who has trouble sleeping.
