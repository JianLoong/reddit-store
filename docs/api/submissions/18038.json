{"id": 18038, "submission_id": "13q8bsq", "title": "AITA for not wanting my sister to sleep in my bed", "selftext": "For context I'm a 18 year old female and my sister is 22 and recently she came home from college and decided since her bed is uncomfortable that she gets to sleep in mine. I tried not to care the first few times it happened but my sister snores extremely loud and I have major insomnia and anxiety and sleep paralysis so sleeping is already a major struggle. So I decided to tell her that I can't sleep when she was in my room but she just said that it's not her fault and that if my parent just got her a better mattress that everything would be fine. I told her since it's my room that I get to decided if she sleep in my room or not and then she goes on to tell my parent that I'm the asshole for not letting her sleep in my room and then I end getting in trouble or told to get over it and then end up sleeping so horribly. So am I the asshole?\n\n\n\nUPDATE- So I did what some of you said. For some more context : I don\u2019t have a door so I can\u2019t lock my sister out.  Also when I was younger I went through something similar as my sister except worse my bed had broke and my parent didn\u2019t want to buy me a new one so I ended spending my time with my mattress on my floor my mattress was also broken with a spring that pop out in the middle it was awful and uncomfortable I spent six year like that before I got a new one and I never complained or made my sister deal with it but now I have to deal with my sister!! .Anyways I decided I was going to let my sister sleep in my room one more time just to not piss her off to much but she started snoring really bad and it woke me up around 3:00 and I ended not sleeping for an an hour and a half and so I gently kicked her in her sleep to get her to stop snoring but she woke up and was extremely mad I told her it was just because I couldn\u2019t sleep and then things got bad she said that it\u2019s not her fault and then I told her that she should maybe get a mattress topper or try and talking to my mom more and that i really shouldn\u2019t be the one dealing with this but saying this to her got her more angry she got out my bed purposely stepping on me and hurting me and then yelling and making a fuss around the whole house. I told her she 22 and that she need to be more responsible for herself. She basically said because I only work three-four days a week and she work like everyday she has priority over sleep.WHICH YOU WOUKD THINK IF SHE WORKED EVER DAY SHE COULD AFFORD AND MATTRESS BUT NO . I think what I did was kinda mean because she did have work that morning but also like I had stuff I had to wake up early too for", "created_utc": 1684894863, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13q8bsq/aita_for_not_wanting_my_sister_to_sleep_in_my_bed/", "score": 83, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should figure it out & move the heck out!!!", "No because then OP will end up on the crappy bed instead of her sister.", "How do you figure that?", "Because her parents would make her sleep in the other room for kicking her sister with boots on.

How is this not obvious to you?", "At what point did I say she should get into bed with boots on and start arbitrarily kicking her sister?\n\nSister snores -> OP wakes up -> OP kicks hard -> sister wakes up. \n\nOne hard kick is far more efficient and effective than a series of gentle ones. Sister lost any right to civility when she impinged on OPs space in this manner. \n\nDo it enough times and the poor sleep sister starts to experience will outweigh any mild discomfort from a less than stellar mattress. \n\nAlso, you didn\u2019t answer the question. If OP doesn\u2019t want to leave the bed, how do you think the parents are going to make her sleep elsewhere?", ">Kick her hard and with boots on.\n\nYou literally said to kick her with boots on. Did you mean she should wake up, get out of bed, put some boots on, kick her sister from somewhere other than in bed, and then quickly take the boots off and jump back in bed before the sister notices?  \n\n\nAnd what I was saying was to never let her fall asleep. Just keep tossing and turning until she moves of her own accord.   \n\n\nAnd yes, OP doesn't want to leave the bed, but she kicks her sister while wearing boots, her parents are likely to remove her from that room and make her sleep in the other room, OR they'll take the better bed and put it in the sister's room and make OP sleep on the crappy bed.   \n\n\nNow you're saying you never said to kick her wearing boots (even though you absolutely did say that) so we're back to just making the sister uncomfortable until she moves. My way does it where OP won't likely get in trouble for it, whereas your way will... well... I don't know what your way will do since you keep changing the parameters of your way.", "At no point did I say I didn\u2019t say to kick with boots on. \n\nI asked where I said go to bed with boots on and start kicking arbitrarily - you quoted a sentence that contains neither of those in response. \n\nSo you\u2019re just making shit up to suit your imaginary narrative now. \n\nNone of which is supported by anything in the OP. \n\nGood job, have at it.

With lazy parents it\u2019s often the case of the squeaky wheel gets greased. Your sister is causing more of a fuss right now so your parents want you to sacrifice to make it stop. I say you get dramatic and louder than her\u2026. Maybe they won\u2019t want to deal with you then and they\u2019ll tell her to sleep in her own room.
