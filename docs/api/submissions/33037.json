I just looked at her and ignored her basically, cuz the kids were fine in my opinion.

A few minutes later, a guy standing near us said to me \"Are you pretending to be deaf? This woman told you something.\" and was basically pretty rude to me.

I paid for my seat and people cannot just ask me to give it up. They don't know what I have been through or if I was exhausted from work, not feeling well, or may have a non apparent disability. I may have given up my seat if it was a super elderly, or a very pregnant lady, and/or someone with visible disability which would make standing difficult. But like you said, these are kids -- energetic and would have no problem with this sitch. Dangerous, yes,  but from the looks of it, they might be used to it. Also, where is this?

It wasn't super busy when they got on but it's a long route and we picked up people along the way. Every time we did, the teachers corralled the kids further and further back on the bus, tripling them up in the seats, squishing them back so that other people could sit down.

Why didn't those two assholes give up their seats?", "NTA. I have been given dirty looks and comments for not giving up seats to children. I have also had a random child sit on my leg without thinking when we were on transit and the supervising adult did not notice until I caught her eye and gestured to said child.

Those adults minding them must have been stressed to hell.\n\nYour choice to entirely blank a fellow adult talking to you WAS rude as hell.  YTA for that alone.", "It's always nice to ask.  I don't think anyone needed to be rude, like shame you, but if a teacher got on and is trying to wrangle kids, yeah, it would have been nice to ask.", "ESH. Whilst you have no obligation to give up your seat, it\u2019s the commonly decent thing to do. Children have less balance and in greater chance of danger standing. Yes whilst not all of the children would have been able to sit, you would have made it a little bit safer for some of them. Now personally speaking, I think that you were all rude as hell. The woman could have asked politely, you didn\u2019t have to blank stare at the lady, and the dude should have minded his business.", "Thank you for the response. This is in Serbia.

That's an age when many would be at risk of getting hurt if the bus had to break quickly.", "The bus motion is pretty strong. You\u2019d have to be quite strong to be able to stand in a moving bus without falling. Small kids won\u2019t always be about to do that.", "Nope, it was just a random woman and a guy.
