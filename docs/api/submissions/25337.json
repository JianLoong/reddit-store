I learned a LONG time ago, you are never lending money.  Why?  Because it\u2019s rare people pay you back.  I always tell people no on borrowing money unless I look at my back account balance and know I can afford to never see the money I\u2019m \u201clending\u201d out again.  It sounds to me like you understand this same lesson and no you shouldn\u2019t be sorry about that and it definitely doesn\u2019t make you an AH!", "Someone asked and you said no.  \n\nNTA for saying no.  You know from past experience it is very hard chasing ofter that money.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine asking someone I\u2019m not that close to for a loan like that.  That\u2019s the kind of thing you ask family or best friends for. Unless you have already done that and burned those bridges\u2026..", "NTA\n\nYou're probably never gonna see that money again if you did.  You have no obligation to lend her money.  Sucks that she's judging you for it but hey at least you're not out of a large amount of money.", "NTA\n\nYou have your own personal rules about lending money and you're honoring it. You explained it to her. Think about all the people who in the past have asked and you turned down, but she wants a exceptions for her? How is she more important then family. Nope. Also is everyone else who also didn't lend her money also a bad person? Obviously no. If she's acting odd after it's her who made $$ a condition to being friendly to you. She was asking for a big favor from someone she's not even close to. Maybe people close to her know better. \n\n*Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm*", "You're not obligated to be a charity to everyone who asks.\n\nShe's only the AH because she kept pushing after you declined.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I understand she\u2019s upset but she should also learn that just because you said no, it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t want to. You have your own expenses plus, when lending money, it\u2019s not often you get paid back. This is why I learned to lend money that I can easily forget or not to do it at all. If your co-worker asks for a large amount, one way to not make it too large an amount is to ask from multiple people. \n\nFor example, she asks for $500. She could probably ask 5 different people $100 each so it\u2019s not too heavy for one person.", "NTA\n\nNever lend money unless you're prepared to never get it back.", "You'd get the same attitude from her if you did lend her the money (if not worse) once you asked for it back.

You are never the asshole for looking out for yourself before essential strangers. She didn't want a lend, she wanted a gift.", "NTA. Absolutely do not lend her the money unless you can afford to lose it without any hard feelings. It\u2019s highly unlikely that someone in that situation is going to be able to repay you. Your best bet is to say I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not in a position to loan money to anyone right now.", "NTA.  If it was $5 I am sure there wouldn't be an issue but I am guessing this was a huge chunk of money. No is a complete sentence. You shouldn't need to give a reason.", "NTA. \"I don't lend money. If you want to talk about it, maybe we can come up with another way I can help.\"", "NTA\n\nThis is your money.  You work for it..............HOURLY!  No one is obligated to this money but you.  She can be disappointed but she's not entitled to your money nor is anyone else unless you have a dependent like a child.\n\nYeah it sucks to see someone in need and have to draw a line, but you are not obligated to give them money that might put you in that exact same situation.", "NTA 100%\n\nAnd while it SHOULDN\u2019T be like this, it often is the case that when someone expects you to be able to easily do them a favour and you refuse, it\u2019s difficult for the person asking to not feel slighted. \nAssuming your friend/colleague isn\u2019t an entitled asshole themselves, this will resolve itself over time but don\u2019t force tryna explain your position to her because from personal experience \u201cI\u2019ve been burnt so many times lending to people before\u201d when you\u2019re refusing money they know you can afford just sounds like you trust them even less than the people that actually let you down, to the person in the moment.", "NTA I don\u2019t know anyone who would ask to borrow money from a coworker unless it was their best friend or family at a push. That doesn\u2019t sound right so hold onto your cash", "Nta\n\n\nIt takes a lot of balls to ask a coworker for money.  \n\nAbsolutely not. Especially given the significance of the amount.\n\n\nThis coworker is wrong. I would just avoid them when you can. Be professional but keep distance.", "NTA. How sad that your young coworker has no family or friends or credit card or credit for a bank loan. How sad that she earns so much less than you do.", "That's honestly how I feel. I felt awkward about it because I have to see this person daily.", "Nta. As others said, you\u2019re right not to make a loan if you can\u2019t afford for it to be a gift. Suggest she ask your boss for an advance on her paycheck, if what she really needs is temporary.", "Agree, NTA. Lending money should not be a requirement of a colleague/ friend to like or being civil with you. \n\nThey might be stressed and in a bad situation, but ultimately it is their burden to bear and they should not make you feel bad about this. If you feel like you want to do something to support them, other than lending them money there are other ways to do so. Even just checking in with them and making sure they have someone to talk to about these things or recommending somewhere local that they can get proper support/ advice from.", "You shouldn't feel awkward for saying \"No.\""]}
