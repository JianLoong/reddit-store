My son made it perfectly clear he did not want his mom in the examination room, just me.\n\nSomething came up yesterday and I asked her if she could take Liam and I'd be like 20 minutes late. She could leave or wait in the waiting room when I arrived. She said okay. \n\nWhen I arrived, neither my son nor my ex was there. I asked the front desk if they ever came and she looked confused. She said Liam came in with his dad and they were waiting for the doctor. I said, well I'm the dad. I asked if she meant my son's stepdad Chris. She said that makes sense and explained a lot (Liam and Chris look nothing alike).\n\nThey told me to go to exam room 5 and the doctor was having my son do some squating thing and sure enough, there was Chris. \n\nI whispered to Chris thanks for dropping Liam off and then there was there super cringe awkward moment when the doctor asked my son to pull down his underwear in front of us. My son's drawstring wouldn't untie and Chris instinctively tried to untie it but couldn't. So he just pulled his pants and my son almost fell down and Chris looked at me and shrugged and joked \"well it's not anything I haven't seen. I've been his stepdad for awhile. I've bathed him and Charlie (my son's stepbrother) together.\"\n\nThen he told my son who looked uncomfortable and said \"it's okay. We're all guys in the room. I actually got to go too.\" Then he left. It was weird. I told my son that's not how physicals usually work out and I'm sorry I was late. He didn't say anything which is unlike him. He did ask to stay at my house (he is with his mom Monday through Wednesday and me the rest of the week).\n\nI told him I'd ask his mom. I did call her and she wanted to know why. I said he's had a rough day. Leave it at that. And you should had told me you weren't going to make this appointment instead of Chris. She asked if something happened with Chris and I said no something happened with you not communicating with me. It mattered. She said she got stuck on a work call. I said so what? You could had texted me.\n\nChris texted me this morning and said he wanted to take Liam and the rest of the kids out for ice cream after school. I knew he was trying to make up for what happened.

It's bad enough to be a kid his age getting a physical, but weird vibes between you and stepdad was probably the last thing he needed.

Your ass try showing up 16 mins late and watch them turn you away. In some cases they will even fine them.  So you being 20 mins late would have meant a rescheduled appointment and a fine if you lived in a similar place. Even still, I am sure they wouldn't have saw you regardless.

And thats where everything became a shit show. \nYes the kid made it to his physical but clearly was uncomfortable and was going to be uncomfortable with someone besides his father. \nIf there were communication between Chris and father about the mom not being able to make it ,or with the father and mother that chris can make it and she cant.  It sounds and is a big deal, first and foremost to the kid! Which is why secondly to the father, who is also stuck in this shit end of the stick because of his wife who didnt communicate and left the three guys to bump into eachother making all of it awkward for the kid.", "Of course it wasn't urgent, it was just more important than his son's medical appointments are to him.", "No, OP think the doctors should have waited the 20 minutes after the start of the appointment for him to show up.", "Lol according to OP, his son didn't even tell him that he wanted him. All his son said was that he didn't want his mom (a woman) with him at the appointment. OP took it to mean that his son wanted him and only him when his son might have been okay with the stepfather there. \n\nJust like how OP told Chris that the son was mad at him when the son never expressed that to him (according to OP's comments he assumed his son was mad at Chris but he never confirmed with his son). Looks like OP just assumes shit from his son", "Because it\u2019s rude not to be on time? Sometimes people do things simply because it\u2019s the right thing to do when you live in a society.", "I'm telling you while that may be your experience, it isn't like that everywhere. You made a blanket statement that wasn't true.", "Tell us that you made a general statement that was based upon your personal experience and it turned out that you shouldn\u2019t have done so, because your experience doesn\u2019t equal the experience of everyone else."]}
