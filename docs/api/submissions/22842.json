We both had to switch jobs over the course of the year and our daughter (14F) has struggled significantly with her mental health.  Our son (12M) plays baseball on a travel team and we have struggled to take care of our daughter and not let our son down in the process.  We live in a big city where cost of living is high, and so is travelling here as a tourist.  \n2 weeks ago my husband\u2019s aunt called my MIL (60s?) and informed her that his cousin (35F) and her three kids (2M, 6F, 10F) was coming to stay with us for 3 days in the big city.  At the end of the 3 days his aunt would pick them up and take them to her place to have a couple weeks at grandmas house. Basically his cousin has had a lot going on and she deserves a vacation so she was coming to our place where we could help with the 3 kids and she could be a tourist and relax.  We are supposed to pick her and the kids at the train station and take them to our place from there. \n\nMy Husband and I were informed of all of this along with the fact that we would be hosting 2 family dinners during that time.  \n\nTo say I was livid would have been the understatement of the year.  The 3 days she is here are weekdays when both my husband and I have to work, my daughter has a therapy session, and my son has a game in a city an hour away.  \n\nWhen my husband and I said ummm no.  We were told by his family we are being unreasonable. So we arranged for her to have a guest room in my moms condo about a 10 minute drive away so she and the kids had a place to stay.  This set off his side of the family again because it made her feel unwelcome.  Mind you we had tried to reach out to the cousin directly repeatedly since her mom (husband\u2019s aunt) informed us of the plans. She won\u2019t answer texts or emails.  Every time we reach out his aunt calls us back and guilts us. \n\nHis family thinks we are not being welcoming and should help this poor lady with so many kids out and let her have a 3 day vacation. She doesn\u2019t have a lot of money and this would be the only way for her to stay in the city.  \n\nAITA for standing my ground and not helping my husband\u2019s less fortunate cousin? The more I hear from his family the more I am starting to feel bad for her but just can\u2019t handle that many kids in our space right now.", "created_utc": 1689979879, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1562vkz/aita_for_standing_my_ground_and_not_helping_my/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing here says anything other than you did the right thing.", "NTA. She should feel unwelcome because she is not welcome. You don\u2019t just inform people you are coming to stay with them. You talk in advance and plan out a time that works well for all parties involved. \n\n\nIf you are willing to help her with this vacation at another time, that would be very nice of you but SHE needs to plan that out with you, not her mom and even then you have no obligation to do that. You have your own life and  struggles and it seems like they are a lot right now.", "NTA. They don\u2019t get to run your lives. It\u2019s inconvenient, you\u2019re busy, the answer is no. If they don\u2019t want to stay in your mom\u2019s condo they can get a hotel. Not your problem. Period. Stop reaching out.", "Nta. You can't help someone else when you're barely holding yourselves together. Wtf? The entitlement of the family is astounding!\n\nWho do they think they are?

And that fact that your generous offer of an alternate place to stay was turned down is ridiculous.\n\nTell everyone involved - MIL, Aunt, etc. that you are not going to host, period.  The fact that the cousin won't even return phone calls is an indication of a serious problem and you don't want to find out what that problem is.\n\nWhoever wants to complain can host the cousin instead.", "NTA\n\nHow can you help people when you cannot even help yourself.

The aunt can pick them up at the train station. She can't stay with you (and in fact she isn't welcome.) Okay, you don't seem like someone who could actually say the second part, but you could imply it.\n\nYou could say that you are out of town for one of your son's games.\n\nWhy is this between the parents and not your husband and the cousin.

That is a bold level of entitlement and presumption to inform you through the grape vine that you are hosting visitors in your home. If anything, husbands cousin or aunt should have called HIM and very politely said they would be coming to your area and ASKED if there was any way they could crash with you while there. While she watches her own good kids unless you offered to babysit. At which point it would have still been reasonable of you to cite your busy schedules and full house and politely declined. The way your MiL and her sister went about it was ridiculous and just flat out rude. If his family cares so much about giving the cousin a good time, her or aunt mom can pay for an Airbnb and go with her daughter so SHE can help watch the kids. Or take you up on the kind offer of staying at your moms extra bedroom.

You can ask if it\u2019s possible but not demand. \n\nAs to the she doesn\u2019t feel welcome part, guess what auntie she isn\u2019t. You all need a break as much if not more than the cousin does.", "Your aunt and mom voluntold you to let your cousin visit.  They told you the days and conditions.

If they didnt want to deal with pushback they shouldn't have invited themselves.\n\nYou were already so generous arranging alternate accommodation! \n\nWhy can't they drop the kids at gmas first and have the cousin stay solo with your mom?? That's if that's still on the table. Personally I'd just shut this down and be fine with dropping relations with family this nutty.", "NTA.\n\nIf cousin needs a vacation, let those who invited her deal with her.

I thought my wife's family was bad, but never once have I had to be informed that I was welcoming someone to stay with me, let alone provide child care, and especially not for 3 weekdays, when I have to work.\n\nAbsolutely NTA. Don't just stand your ground on this, everyone involved has declared they are more important than you, and their problems are more important than your problems.", "Hospitality is a gift you give others. You are not required to give that gift, ever. And if you do, it's always on your terms, ie. you're welcome to come for dinner on Thursday. Or stay the night on Friday.
