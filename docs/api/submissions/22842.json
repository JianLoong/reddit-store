Our son (12M) plays baseball on a travel team and we have struggled to take care of our daughter and not let our son down in the process.  We live in a big city where cost of living is high, and so is travelling here as a tourist.  \n2 weeks ago my husband\u2019s aunt called my MIL (60s?) and informed her that his cousin (35F) and her three kids (2M, 6F, 10F) was coming to stay with us for 3 days in the big city.  At the end of the 3 days his aunt would pick them up and take them to her place to have a couple weeks at grandmas house. Basically his cousin has had a lot going on and she deserves a vacation so she was coming to our place where we could help with the 3 kids and she could be a tourist and relax.  We are supposed to pick her and the kids at the train station and take them to our place from there. \n\nMy Husband and I were informed of all of this along with the fact that we would be hosting 2 family dinners during that time.  \n\nTo say I was livid would have been the understatement of the year.  The 3 days she is here are weekdays when both my husband and I have to work, my daughter has a therapy session, and my son has a game in a city an hour away.  \n\nWhen my husband and I said ummm no.  We were told by his family we are being unreasonable. So we arranged for her to have a guest room in my moms condo about a 10 minute drive away so she and the kids had a place to stay.  This set off his side of the family again because it made her feel unwelcome.  Mind you we had tried to reach out to the cousin directly repeatedly since her mom (husband\u2019s aunt) informed us of the plans. She won\u2019t answer texts or emails.  Every time we reach out his aunt calls us back and guilts us. \n\nHis family thinks we are not being welcoming and should help this poor lady with so many kids out and let her have a 3 day vacation.

And the fact the cousin won't talk to them?!", "Happy cake day!", "Happy cake day!", "My sister had a doormat that said, \"go  away.\"", "If you could help, it would have to be at a time of your choosing. You can\u2019t be expected to drop everything exactly when they say so. Your aunt is showing complete disrespect for you and your life; she\u2019s essentially saying that none of what you\u2019re doing has value.", "She is forcing her feigned helplessness (Someone needs to watch my kids so I can go on a vacation) on you.", "Of course it does because they don't want to be inconvenienced with helping her themselves.\n\nThe echo chamber could:\n\n* Offer to take the kids for her\n* Pool funds together to pay for a holiday for her\n\nInstead, they are trying to bully your family into doing something you're not at a stage in life to handle. You have your own children who need help, your own difficulties to handle, and no time to host other people.\n\nDon't you dare back down, OP, they are not entitled to your home, funds, or time. Block anyone who is continuing to bully you and refuse to discuss this with any of them. Stonewall them. You are not crazy here, you and your family are victims being taken advantage of.", ">Before covid we had a bit of an everyone is welcome policy and liked touristing with family and friends.\n\nUnannounced and unplanned? Certainly not. There isn't any 'rule change' on your side, there is only blatant disrespect and gaslighting on theirs.", "Stop. This is on them. NOT YOU", "Nope. Even if family has an open door \u201ccome visit us!\u201d policy you always check ahead of time, check calendars, logistics. \n\nWe are visiting a big city, cousins live there and we are always welcome. We are planning a trip where we will be in their city. We sent an email \u201chey, we are thinking of traveling to ___ on these dates, will you be in town? We could do a day or touristy stuff, then maybe a dinner?\u201d \n\nWe arent staying with them, but we would be so welcome. There have been times when they have been in town and we have great family time. There are times when we will be there but they won\u2019t be or they have previous engagements. And we are all bummed to not connect but that\u2019s life when you work and have kids and have small windows of time to vacation. \n\nThat\u2019s how healthy grownups communicate. Your in-laws are so so unreasonable. You have a lot on your plate. Best of luck to all of you!", "My aunt lives in California and my mom and I visit her on vacation all the time. Every time we leave, she says \"please come back again soon!\" or \"you can stay with us any time you like!\" An absolute open-door policy. (And she does it for the rest of the extended family too.) Neither of us would EVER plan a visit to her without checking first if she felt like having visitors, and making sure the timing was good for whatever else she had going on in her life. This is 100% on them, not you.", "You were pretty generous setting her up with the guest suite at your moms condo. She can take it or leave it.", "If I were you I'd be expecting people with suitcases at the door.  Hopefully you aren't home, for hours and hours.", "[removed]", "Her mom could come early to the city and watch the kids.", "Comment stolen from u/xoxo_jk29.  Report as a bot and downvote.", "bot ... report you", "...me?  Nope, just someone who can see a suspicious-looking sentence and use CTRL-F to find the original comment it came from.", "Ummm... what the hell? So your aunt and mother in law just volunteered your house as an unpaid Airbnb... without asking for your permission in any way? No, you're not the asshole for saying no. The aunt and the mother in law are definitely gigantic assholes.", "NTA. It doesn't matter that you had an \"everyone is welcome\" rule before the pandemic. If she wanted to come to your city, she should have asked if it's ok to stay with you. You even offered them a place to stay at your mom's because you can't host them. She didn't even give you the courtesy of talking to you directly and had to use third parties to do her \"dirty work\" all the while avoiding your calls and texts.", "I would really enjoy a web series of 15-20 mins of episode each which take references from the stories posted in this sub and give satisfactory ending to all of them.", "Ya, no. NTA. No communication + no notice = no dice. The audacity is blowing my mind.", "NTA I can\u2019t believe people actually do this. You found her a place to stay you can\u2019t take her kids as you have full plates. What do they expect you to do not work and cancel your kids activities?", "She IS unwelcome! Stand your ground. \n\nNTA", "So mood disorders run in your family? This kind of assumption is crazy. NTA", "NTA,the entitlement of aunt, mil, and cousin is astounding.", "Why is the comms via mums and not directly between your husband and the cousin, that's just weird.", "Dear God what is up with all the entitlement???\n\nWhat rational human being just informs someone that their home is going to be used as a hotel for 3 days??\n\nI can really really empathize with you here, cos this has happened to me as well when I was a teenager... One of my great aunts was having a tough time, and her sister told her that oh you can just go to (my) house every weekend, and relax there. She told this to my mom, who was like wtf.\n\n And that was just one person, and on the weekends when we didn't have anything important going on, mostly relaxing.\n\nCan't even imagine how you feel, NTA so much", "No is enough as a sentence", "NTA go no contact with these presumptuous entitled people", "NTA. Nice people do not invite themselves or others to peoples houses.", "NTA. They didn't plan with you,  so they can't expect you to drop everything. Made me think of myn moms favorite quote \"poor planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on my part\"", "NTA\n\nEntitled much? No consent or talking with you about this in advance. They planned to invite themselves over and intrude on your lives. Screw that. Change your numbers. It's not your responsibility to fix other people's lives, especially when they are adults and are responsible for themselves.", "Holy crap.  NTA.  The manipulation tactics alone is enough for you to be justified in being an AH, even though you weren\u2019t.  If some family member called me and told me that I was to be hosting dinners with the following guests and three kids I would go through the roof and then say eff no.  Jesus.  Just no.", "All of this! Especially the end. But also... OP should just throw it back at aunt. Like \"Oh no, that doesn't work for us. But you can just take her early or pay for her hotel and watch her kids the whole time. That works for us!\"", "And watch her 3 kids while she relaxes and does touristy stuff.", "I also just want to say that even if you weren't having a rough year, even if you weren't busy with obligations to your own children, you would not be required to say yes. Hosting four extra people for multiple days is difficult when you plan for it. I can't imagine dealing with it when you're not expecting it. \n\nI hope that the rest of the year goes better for you. You're a great mom who puts her (nuclear) family first, as it should be.", "I.k.r.  what makes her more special than any other parent with 3 kids or any kids.", "OP has her own children with commitments; they are her priority & she is their example of being reliable for appointments & dependable for teammates.  She has to look out for her own before she has anything left over to host on demand.  NTA.", "> She told this to my mom, who was like wtf.", "Okay bro leave it...", "Dude, I read your reply and totally respect it, then I find a suspicious comment from kebler81 on another thread and realize *he's* a bot too!  LOL!  Good thing I didn't keep going, arguing with a bot!"]}
