Hell no. \n\nIf you have a destination wedding, people not coming because of this is part of the deal.", "NTA. That\u2019s ridiculous. A destination wedding is fine if all your guests are obscenely wealthy. Otherwise no. Asking somebody to shell out a good portion of their annual income, and probably of their annual leave too, is horribly entitled and then to get pissy when they decline the invitation not only takes the biscuit but dunks it in custard and swallows it whole.", "I always thought you were suppose to pay for your wedding party to come to your destination wedding?", "To be fair: Your Corolla is not exactly a prime wedding location.", "This. Do this OP.", "Actually that\u2019s a good point. My wedding cost less than that too. All in. \n\nIt was a while ago though (1999)", "NTA that\u2019s absurd. People need to keep their guests in mind when booking these things, not everyone can afford to spend that and frankly many don\u2019t want to. To put that into perspective the last destination wedding I went to was for a very very wealthy girl and the President of that country helicoptered in to attend the wedding and we spent 4K total. It was a very fancy wedding. Where on earth is your friend getting married?", "Omg NTA - you already paid for the wedding to happen it sounds like?? (Isn\u2019t that supposed to be done by the family or her fiance\u2019s family??) \n\nI agree with everyone else - she should pay for you to get there", "MTA. That is an exorbitant amount. She is selfish.", "NTA. She put a price tag in your friendship that you cannot afford. You know where her head is. Appearances. Write her off.", "NTA. Usually for destination weddings, the couple foots the cost. At least where I am from. They pay for whoever they invite. It helps them manage the number as no one can show up unannounced and must RSVP months in advance. If your BFF wants one, she should fork out the cash otherwise, she should be ok with people, even you, missing it.", "Definitely NTA. If she wants you there, she can pay for it. This is an outrageous amount to pay to be her assistant for a day.", "NTA\n\nYou would love to be there, but it just isn't in the budget.    \n\nApparently, your friendship isn't even worth the price of a dress to her.    Don't feel bad about it.", "NTA. If you chose to have a destination wedding and aren\u2019t paying for everyone then you are also choosing to exclude people with lower income or tighter budgets. \n\nYou are Never the ass for answers if No to a destination wedding.", "NTA. If your friendship should be worth more than that, then ask her to split the cost with you", "NTA. If she wants you there, it's pretty standard for the wedding party to be included in the cost of a destination wedding. You should at least have lodging, food and the dress covered.", "NTA \n\nThis is the downside of a destination wedding. Some people simply can't afford it and that's life.", "NTA\n\nShe can't expect you to spend thousands and then be upset when you say it's unread in comparison to $75.", "8k is about how much my wife and I spent on our own wedding all in all. So pretty crazy to be expected to pay just to be a guest at someone else's. NTA", "NTA and by the way: this is not a friend", "I just want to tell bridezilla \u201coh yeah Janice, I\u2019d love to not be able to pay rent for 4 months so I can attend your wedding, unfortunately, I\u2019m not a park bench so I need a GD roof over my head, but have a lovely day, girl.\u201d", "NTA. They are ridiculous. I don't understand why couples don't just get married in their dream destination by themselves and then have the reception at home, unless they can afford to pay all expenses for the guests.", "Love \u201cworking vacation\u201d ha! That\u2019s exactly what destination weddings are. Don\u2019t people realize that asking someone to sacrifice their vacation days and money on your cheesy reception only to be stuck in convo with aunt Muriel for two hours is a living nightmare?", "rude", "Mine was $7000 for 70 people in 2001."]}
