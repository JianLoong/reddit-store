We\u2019ve been together since HS and are very in love. It\u2019s hard, but worth it.\n\nShe goes to a community college in our hometown and I\u2019m at Stanford. She recently applied to go to college with me and got rejected. She has been off since she found out.\n\nWe ended up getting into an argument. She told me she doesn\u2019t want to go back to college. I tried talking to her. I said school is what is best for her and she shouldn\u2019t let the rejection hit so hard. \n\nShe says I never wanted to go to Stanford anyway (which is a lie, I know how badly she wanted to get in) and insisted she should drop out and come live with me instead.\n\nI said oh, you want to get a job & live with me? I said you could go to a community college around me.\n\nBut she said the weirdest thing. She said I\u2019m tired of college, and I don\u2019t want a job. I can cook and clean and look after you.\n\nI was honestly surprised. I said like what, a traditional \u201chousewife\u201d? That\u2019s really what you want?\n\nShe said yes, people have been doing it for 100s of years. Why not? \n\nI said I\u2019m not interested in a relationship like that. \n\nShe got frustrated with me. She said \u201cof course, no one respects a housewife anymore, but they do a lot of work. A real man would appreciate that they have a woman at home cooking/cleaning for them. It\u2019s real work and it\u2019s hard work but men like you have no appreciation for the work women do.\u201d\n\nI said I have appreciation for it, but it\u2019s not a relationship I want. I want a partner that is motivated in her career and to suceed just like I am. I added that I have a tiny apartment and it\u2019s not like she knows how to cook. It is work, I guess, but nothing compared to school/an actual job. \n\nShe said I was implying a woman\u2019s value is determined on her ability to work/go to school. She said I have no respect for women and was sexist.\n\nI just got fed up and annoyed and snapped at her. I said I wasn\u2019t being sexist. Imagine if I said I didn\u2019t want a job and was going to stay home while my gf paid all the bills, worked, and went to school. Everyone would call me a deadbeat, lazy asshole. I also said she\u2019d make a terrible traditional wife. She doesn\u2019t want kids, and she doesn\u2019t know how to cook or clean. I know how to cook better than she does. What kind of tradwife is she going to make? I\u2019m also 20 and not looking to have someone be reliant on me. I said it\u2019s important for her to get a job and be financially secure for herself. I also said she was only saying this stuff because she got rejected from Stanford. Hello, it\u2019s Stanford. They reject everyone. She loves her career and can\u2019t seriously let a set back that small keep her from what she really wants to do. So many people get rejected from schools like that, you can\u2019t just drop out. Like you got rejected, big deal, try again next year. \n\nAfter I said all of that, she was just silent. She didn\u2019t even say anything and just went to her room and locked herself in. AITA here? Do I need to apologize immediately?", "created_utc": 1704271771, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xeu6j/aita_for_telling_my_girl_shed_make_a_terrible/", "score": 536, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is either a temporary state of mind fuelled by her recent disappointment with Stanford, or she always wanted this and sprung it on you out of nowhere. You tried to have a reasonable discussion about it, but given that she can't cook and likely doesnt want to raise a family...she's not quite the tradwife type and won't be able to do it well enough for a valuable contribution to your home-life. Never mind that there is no realistic way you can support a two person household at 20. Her plans are not grounded in reality.", "NTA. You made your point. Maybe with harsh words, but it is a valid point. And yes you don't have to have a relationship you don't want - just so she can stay at home doing nothing (not saying house wifes don't do anything. But it sounds like you are taking care of this chores yourself at the moment and she doesn't know how to do most of it)\n\nAlso it would be sexist if you said, she has to become a housewife.", "NTA. I'm a SAHM and my husband is the breadwinner. This was a decision we came to together after MONTHS of discussion and planning. It was not spur of the moment, it was not me decided that's what we needed to do.\n\nThe entire process was filled with both of us ensuring the other was happy with the decision, and even still we check in an evaluate each other's needs and wants on a regular basis.\n\nIf that is not what you want, you don't have to take it. The way you went about it is harsh, but necessary. If she's been moping for a while, she might need a wake up call.", "NTA. It does sound like the rejection hit her really hard, and she's using the tradwife role as an excuse to give up on herself. It doesn't sound like she really knows what a \"tradwife\" really does - it's way more than just cooking and cleaning and taking care of her man, even if there are no children to also care for (and I'm not talking about ironing her husband's boxers and handkerchiefs like my grandmother did). But, what if you two go this route, and something happens to you that she then has to take care of herself? Will she resent the years of her life that she \"gave up\" for you? At 20, does she really understand that she will be dependent on you for her security for the next 40, 60, or more years of your lives? Even if you both decide later that she will be a SAHW, it is in her best interest now to build something of her own so she knows she can be self-sufficient and independent if the future turns to crap.", "My goodness, NTA in the least. She is using ALL the sexist tropes to try and gaslight you into taking care of her because she suffered a major disappointment. Good for you for not letting her get away with it. That being said, if this is the kind of trash thinking she has roiling around her head, I'd have serious doubts about the viability of the relationship moving forward.\n\nedit-removed an unfortunate turn of phrase", "NTA. The Traditional housewife mindset has been taking off on social media lately. It\u2019s just an out for girls to be lazy. They\u2019re not interested in doing any of the responsibilities of the traditional house wife such as cooking and cleaning. They are more interested in being able to stay home and be lazy.\n\nYou did good on calling your GF out. Also, none of my business, but personally I think you should break up sooner rather than later. Your long distance GF does not sound happy for you and sounds rather resentful you\u2019re at Stanford and she\u2019s not. And she seems like she has no aspirations or goals, which sound like the opposite of you\u2019re looking for. Find a nice girl at Stanford.", "NTA. I don't think anything you could have said would have helped her adjust to the rejection. If she wants to be near you I can't even count the number of colleges in or near the Bay area. But she needs to figure out what SHE wants to do, independent of you, and that's something she's going to have to do for herself.", "NTA , ya dude, a Stanford guy gotta be smarter than to continue this relationship", "NTA. Wanting to become a housewife isn\u2019t something you just spring on your partner because of a disappointing rejection. It needs to be DISCUSSED between the two people it\u2019s going to affect. She\u2019s being ridiculously immature for not even including you in the conversation prior to just announcing it.\n\nAlso, you\u2019re right. If she doesn\u2019t know how to cook or clean, what does she expect to do all day. How exactly are you undermining the hard work of housewives by pointing that out?\n\nAnd yes, you\u2019re too young to have someone depending on you financially. It seems like she\u2019s looking at this through rose-tinted glasses and not being realistic about her responsibilities as a housewife.", "Beyond other things, her argument is ahistorical. Starting from the fact that cooking and laundry were massively more work for those 100s of years then they are now. Washing without washing machine was whole day of physically hard work every week. Keeping fire in the stove and cooking from scratch including pasta from dough is just not the same as buying dry pasta and put it on induction. Plus, women would do animal care, manufactured candles, did sewing for the whole family, etc. etc.\n\nYet moreover, women in the past did engaged in economic activity compatible with the rest of their house work. Selling eggs and other stuff, serving, making crafts and selling them.\n\n-------------------\n\nThat being said, this is about her having hard time to accept the failure.", "NTA but you want to talk with her again in a more calm and reasonable tone. Her wish was to go and study in Stanford. Was that because she had a specific program in mind or because she wanted to be close to you and together? Might she be terrified that after years together in HS now the distance between you will break your relationship? She is obviously feeling like a failure and trying to define an alternative plan where you two can be physically together, but is also still hurting from the rejection and telling her to just put herself again out there to potentially receive more rejections and feel as even larger failure is a bit too soon. Then again , you basically just yelled at her that she would be a failure at something she obviously thinks is in women's nature. So that definitely didn't help.\n\nTalk again with her and help her focus on making a new plan. In this economy one person (still in college, with potential student debt afterwards) is difficult to support two. Trad wives are usually anchored in farms, where their husbands, them and their kids are all taking care of the livestock, land and work the entire time. I am sure you haven't entered Standford with the idea of becoming a farmer afterwards, so just try and communicate that with her a bit more clearly.\n\nYou already set up a very clear and reasonable boundary - you are looking for a partner that can be your equal in working (even if incomes are different), outside of home and inside. You don't think you will be able to respect a partner that you don't feel is your equal. You don't want your relationship to suffer and you don't want to start looking at her as something less than you believe she is. You understand she might need a little time to reformulate a plan and you can help her with that. But that's where you stand.", "NTA you don\u2019t want a traditional housewife/breadwinner relationship, she does. You either need to find a compromise (maybe she works part-time) or move on.", "NTA but your relationship is clearly over since you have such different life goals.", "NTA. She's calling you sexist for not agreeing to her sexist expectations of you. This is a huge red flag and, while I know this advice gets thrown around easily online, I'd seriously consider ending the relationship as these types of worldviews don't change quickly (if ever).", "NTA. Every adult person should aim to have a job and financially secure themselves. It is a basic survival thing. Being a housewife is work and a lot, but she financially fullu dependant on her partner. And she needs a partner who agrees to be a sole breadwinner. As you do not agree with this format, she should either consider continuing her education and build a career or find another partner.", "NTA break up!! You're too young to be taking on a full-grown baby!!\n\nHopefully, she'll wisen up and go back to school, but don't make yourself a part of the plan. At 20, you haven't even grown your wings yet.", "You might want to take this seriously\u2026 if she means what she says and the life she is proposing isn\u2019t the life you want, try not to get trapped into it.   \nYou are very young and you might one day come to the realization that this is not the woman for you. What then? Breaking up with someone who is completely reliant on you is hard as there might be moral and/or legal consequences.\n\nYou can apologize for being harsh but remember, she asked for it by calling you sexist when you disagreed with her. This means she was trying to gaslight and manipulate you.\n\nHer being quiet and locking herself in her room is part real (she\u2019s upset) and part manipulative (she wants you to feel guilty as that will weaken you).\n\nI hate to say this as a woman\u2026 but this is typical behavior of many women.\n\nNTA\u2026 she was pushing you and you snapped.", "NTA, you made valid points, but I think it wasnt the right time and perhaps you could've made your points in a better (less harsh) way. She still seems emotional about the rejection, maybe give her a bit more time to come to terms with it. Did you try comforting her or empathising with her over the rejection? Don't think you were an asshole, but I guess you can try apologising for how you came across if you want make up with her quickly. Hope it turns out okay.", ">She said I was implying a women\u2019s value is determined on her ability to work/go to school. She said I have no respect for women and was sexist.\n\nNo, what she wants is a life of privilege. Most couples these days both have to work full-time in order to pay the bills. They then both have to do the household chores after their job.\n\nBeing able to stay at home and only do household chores is something only those who can afford it do. OP, can you afford it? Because otherwise you'll get to eat sandwiches with peanut butter or yam for lunch every single day. Surviving day-to-day because one partner refuses to work is one of the easiest ways to build resentment. This isn't just for her benefit; it's also for yours.\n\nNTA. The only thing you need to figure out now is whether this is something temporary because she's genuinely upset over not being accepted at Stanford or whether this is something she's very set on and/or has been planning for a while now.", "I'm going to say NTA because you are right, she needs to at the very least get an education and she will regret a decision like that later in her life. However, there was no need to tell her she'd be a terrible housewife and I feel like you didn't handle this well.", "NTA. Could you even support a house wife as a college student? Where would the money be coming from? A stay at home spouse in THIS economy?\n\nHey, I\u2019d love to not have to work a day job either, but that would actually put a lot on my partner. Your points were salient and true and she\u2019s just angry because she didn\u2019t get what she wanted", "NTA \n\nShe tried and failed to get in . Fair enough , she\u2019s allowed to be disappointed.\n\nBut this girl quickly figured it out - bf is studying at Stanford, she\u2019s gonna be in the pound seats. If she locks you down now by getting you to take responsibility for her , she\u2019d be golden.\n\nEveryone here voting Y T A is delusional, if it were a girl saying that a guy said that to her , he would\u2019ve been crucified.\n\nShe needs to grow up and figure her own life out. She wants to go from living in her parents house to living in yours. Nope\n\nShe\u2019ll be a liability. And if she\u2019s thinking this way now , expect to hear it again down the line .", "NTA. \n\nFirst of all, it does seem like her rejection from Stanford left her disappointed and perhaps a bit disillusioned. Happens to a lot of people. \n\nSecond, it doesn't sound like she's mentioned this ever before. If this is just coming out of nowhere, it does not sound like it's very well thought-out. \n\nThird, if this is *actually* what she wants, she has to know that this is not what *you* wanted. There's nothing wrong with a stay-at-home spouse, but it has to be something that both partners want. You don't want this, and I assume you have never mentioned that you want it. \n\nFourth, how in the world are you going to be able to support her? I assume you are a full-time undergraduate student. You're probably poor. You have to have somebody with an income to make this dynamic work, and an undergraduate at Stanford is not going to have that income unless the Bank of Mom and Dad is involved, and it's somewhat unlikely they're going to want to support a significant other who isn't doing anything. \n\nFifth, she can't cook, clean, and doesn't want to have kids? I mean, she can learn to cook and clean, but if there aren't going to be any kids... what, exactly, does she plan on doing all day? There's nothing *wrong* with having a stay-at-home spouse with no children, inherently, but I think that most of those situations are \"sugarbaby\"-esque. Which requires a \"sugar Daddy/Mommy.\" A 20-year-old undergraduate at Stanford is not going to be a \"sugar Parent\" for the aforementioned reasons.  \n\nI realize that not all of these situations are \"sugar\"-themed, but many of them involve other things like disability or whatnot. Which do not appear to be present here. \n\nYeah, NTA.", "NTA. So many girls getting sucked into this tradwife BS not realizing they're setting themselves up for a lifetime of financial dependency, potential abuse, being used etc. There's a reason women fought for the right to work and it's not that they al wanted to be girlbosses - they wanted independence so they could walk away from men that mistreated and used them.", "What you complaining about she gonna cook and clean and prolly suck yo dick", "YTA and a fool, OP. An elitist prick so concerned with signaling your virtue and status to your Stanford friends that you're ordering your loving girlfriend to stay away from you. \ud83d\ude44\n\nThis relationship is as good as over.", "I don't think she is wrong in wanting what she wants, but being a SAHS (Stay at Home Spouse) only works if both parties want it, and if both parties respect and are willing to commit to the immense amount of work it takes to be/do that.\nIf she wants to be a trad wife, then she has to know how to budget, handle finances, housework, cooking, and unexpected repairs and challenges. She has to start making the effort now, if she wants to be any good at it. Just like any other job.\n\nYou might have to rethink your position on what constitutes a real job and what doesn't, when perhaps what you mean is you would prefer your parter to have a paying job. Which is fine. \nWhile you were harsh about how you worded your argument, I don't think you were wrong for saying what you did. In fact, you made a couple of good points. No partner - whether a SaHS or not - should be reliant on the other to the extent of them collapsing if that support is taken away.\n\nYou might want to sit down and have a calm discussion about all of this once she's willing to talk, and decide your way forward based on where you stand individually on such matters.\n\nNTA\n\nGood luck OP.", "NTA. Uou could have been a bit gentler about it - she's clearly struggling with her future. But you're in this relationship too and if she isn't earning the  she isn't a partner. Big decisions like this breed resentment unless both parties are 100% on board.", "Absolutely NTA. Think about whether you want to carry on seeing her - and if you do, make sure to use contraception yourself, Do Not rely on her claiming that she's taking oral contraceptives etc, she's not in a good place right now and you don't want to be on the wrong side of a terrible decision.", "NTA. If she comes out of the room to start it up again, just focus on not wanting to support anybody else who isn't literally your own child. Your tiny flat being messy or not is not really going to make any difference to your life, nor would eating out more or less. Or frankly at 20, not eating at all sometimes or even just sleeping in a pile of old clothes. The burden of supporting someone else on the other hand would be a massive step down in lifestyle at 20.\n\nI don't think anything you said was unfair actually. Equal rights mean equal responsibility, and it's just silly Christian propaganda flooding social media that is giving people silly ideas.", "NTA. My mum was an amazing housewife (and person in general), she chose to stay home with me once we could afford it. I think your gf would regret her decision not to pursue an education or employment later in life, and I can't imagine her family will be happy to learn of her new life plan either.", "NTA and if you apologise you're a mug sir. look everyones all for being super nice and wholesome round here, but there comes a point where someones being that much of a cretin they need to be told. she thinks she wants to be a traditional wife? thats great for her, she can go be someone elses tradtional wife.  \n\n\nif you want a partner and not a dependant that does your chores for you then you need to stand strong, i'd fucking die on this hill a thousand times over.", ">people have been doing it for 100s of years. Why not?\n\nNot really true btw. Maybe with the industrial revolution you could stretch it to 200 years. For almost all of history in most places women have been part of the 'workforce'. Most people worked as family units. Women fully focussed on raising children en maintaining the home is a rare situation that became widespread in the 1950s in the US but it has been the exception all the rest of history. Obviously the elites sometimes had situations like this but that would have been the top 10-1%", "While there is absolutely nothing wrong with a stay at home wife or mother, I don't think she put it the greatest way and I really do think she's just disappointed in herself and maybe feels like she isn't going to do well now. Talk it out when you're both calm.", "Can you imagine how things would go if you got upset, told her you wanted her to finance your whole life forever while you cleaned and tidied up a small apartment for her, and then told her she wasn\u2019t \u201ca real woman\u201d when she pushed back on that not being what she wanted? \n\nBecause you should probably take some more offense at that \u201creal man\u201d comment. It\u2019s telling. \n\nAnd a completely different insult and show of her beliefs than all of the other general sexism manipulation tactics she tried.\n\nObviously that\u2019s something you both can potentially work past but she needs to acknowledge it and talk through this with you.\n\nBecause otherwise\u2026 sure yeah. Lots of people would love to have no job, no firm responsibilities tied to their fear about money or insurance or caring for dependents.\n\nI\u2019d love to quit my job and manage the \u201chousehold\u201d with no kids, just clean up and make dinner and lunches. Use my free time for whatever like a new hobby or a fun low stress job. \n\nSounds great.\n\nThat\u2019s just not an option for most humans, and if that\u2019s her actual real life goal now then you both need to acknowledge it before wasting years more together.\n\nMaybe she had more belief in the \u201cget a Mrs degree\u201d at Stanford than you ever thought so now that she can\u2019t even be there she\u2019s clamping on even harder to you.", "NTA. What does she plan to do all day? Cleaning a small apartment and cooking for two is not hard work unless you are an incredibly dirty. Of course it\u2019s different when there are children. Why should you pay for all her expenses? It\u2019s not your responsibility.\n\nAnd calling you sexist is just gaslighting.", "Good for you.\n\nYour 'girl' needs a harsh truth to grow up to be a woman.", "ESH. Her for being immature and not processing rejection well. You for constantly switching around pronouns and not using quotation marks. That was a hard read.", "NTA\n\nshe's facing what a lot of ppl her age are facing. the woes of capitalism. and she wants to not do it.\n\nUnderstandable! But also immensely childish and stupid, it's not a good idea to hobble yourself in a capitalist society by spending years as an adult out of the workforce with no safety net.\n\nand frankly it's not fair to you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm in a trad relationship, and honestly, I respect my girl way more than I would if she was chasing some empty career where we only see each other from 21:00 to 23:00 and on weekends. Thankfully, I make enough money that we never even think of missing a second income.\n\nBut I can also tell you that I wouldn't accept her being a tradwife if she didn't want kids, didn't cook, clean, or manage our finances. The work she does for us is absolutely what makes our household for me one worth working my hardest for. And she dedicates a lot of time to tending to our intimacy.\n\nAll this being said - it sounds like all you want is an equal division of responsibilities in a relationship, which I absolutely applaud you for.\n\nYou're a great partner for giving your girl a reality check, and you're not being an enabler in case she really just wants to coast.", "Send her my way pal, I\u2019ll give her the trad wife treatment\n\nThe fact that she\u2019s even arguing with you proves your point. She isn\u2019t traditional and would traditionally be slapped for that", "You don't need to apologize she needs to grow up", "NTA i am sure she will apologize to you soon", "It is bad to call her that in a \"not so polite\" kind of telling, but I know you got the \"Ok, that's enough!\" Motivate her. Use it as an apology. Being a housewife, of course, also needs the person's energy. You can't just clean one area, then the others are for tomorrow or the very next day. Work and housework are a bit similar (I guess). But do not end it yet.", "NTA and slight AH - thoughts below (and no one has to agree with either)\n\nNTA :\n1. You don't want a 'trad wife,' you want an equal partner in educational experience and career.\n2. She could earn a successful degree towards a rewarding career via a community college, which is still an achievement. \n\nSlight AH:\n\nIt sounds like she feels intellectually inferior to you, and you just told her that couldn't be a traditional SAHP because she can't do the basics such as cooking.\nShe feels reduced to this role, and you told her that she would fail at that too (I am speculating as to her feelings here).\n\nSo, you could be considered the AH and NTA, depending on which way you look at it.\nShe could be a potential succubus who wants to stay home and not contribute financially, or she was emotionally vulnerable and you unintentionally hurt her more.", "You\u2019re completely entitled to not wanting a partner who stays at home and is financially dependent on you, and also to want to be with someone who pursues a career and professional development. I totally support you on that. \nHowever, I\u2019m gonna go with a very soft YTA. Not for not wanting your GF to be a SAH SO, but for saying that SAHing is not comparable to an actual work. It is a very demanding and stressful job indeed. Also soft YTA for saying she would be terrible. Needless to say you can learn how to cook and clean, not that she needs to have those tasks mastered from Day 1. \nAnyhow, I think she doesn\u2019t really want that and she\u2019s speaking from frustration. Let her cool off after the rejection at Stanford, which is probably a huge blow\nfor her (more so if you did get approved) and reevaluate your options once she\u2019s really moved on from that. If then she insists in being a tradwife and that\u2019s definitely not what you want, maybe it will be time to reconsider your relationship.", "NTA but it seems like both of you might end up having different priorities later in life. You should probably still apologize for snapping at her", "NTA dude, how could anyone think you're the asshole here? Sounds like your girl needs to get her priorities straight. School > traditional housewife any day.", "NTA.\n\n\nShe is either very disappointed about the college thing and rejection.\nOr got caught up with redpillers and weird tradwife on social media.", "NTA but you may want to run!", "NTA at all. I wonder if she realises what a trad wife really is too..it goes beyond cooking and cleaning and means she'd have to give up all autonomy with you as \"head of the house\". No making decisions for herself anymore. No doing things without permission, no spontaneous shopping trips, coffee with the girls etc as she'd have an allowance and that's it...well done you for wanting more.", "NTA. She's looking for her free ride.", "So now it\u2019s sexist to tell a woman she should work and be independent? What *isnt* sexist towards women? Nothing, apparently", "NTA. \n\nBut stop trivializing her disappoint. She didn\u2019t get in and it\u2019s not a \u201chello, try again next year\u201d situation.

But she\u2019s just as unlikely to get in next year as she was this year.

My degree was a big help to get me in the door to interview for my first two jobs, after that it had less and less effect.

Still tons of women were teachers and nurses and secretaries and telephone operators, librarians, seamstresses, midwives. Tons of women worked. Not every woman was a stay at home housewife.  Many who were still may have had some part time jobs on the side after the kids got older. It is a myth to act as if women were kept out of the job market. Women were pregnant and with kids mostly as birth control wasn't like it is now and there weren't this many office type jobs. Women STILL won't do the hard stuff.

She recently applied to go to college with me and got rejected. She has been off since she found out.\n\nWe ended up getting into an argument. She told me she doesn\u2019t want to go back to college. I tried talking to her. I said school is what is best for her and she shouldn\u2019t let the rejection hit so hard. \n\nShe says I never wanted to go to Stanford anyway (which is a lie, I know how badly she wanted to get in) and insisted she should drop out and come live with me instead.\n\nI said oh, you want to get a job & live with me? I said you could go to a community college around me.\n\nBut she said the weirdest thing. She said I\u2019m tired of college, and I don\u2019t want a job. I can cook and clean and look after you.\n\nI was honestly surprised. I said like what, a traditional \u201chousewife\u201d? That\u2019s really what you want?\n\nShe said yes, people have been doing it for 100s of years. Why not? \n\nI said I\u2019m not interested in a relationship like that. \n\nShe got frustrated with me. She said \u201cof course, no one respects a housewife anymore, but they do a lot of work.

It\u2019s real work and it\u2019s hard work but men like you have no appreciation for the work women do.\u201d\n\nI said I have appreciation for it, but it\u2019s not a relationship I want. I want a partner that is motivated in her career and to suceed just like I am. I added that I have a tiny apartment and it\u2019s not like she knows how to cook.

What kind of tradwife is she going to make? I\u2019m also 20 and not looking to have someone be reliant on me. I said it\u2019s important for her to get a job and be financially secure for herself.

I would be sad to see her abandon her degree. She has worked really hard for it till this point and is very passionate about it.", "Do you call retired folks lazy? My Grandma quit working in her 50\u2019s and helped out with watching us. She kept her home impeccable, cooked delicious meals, sewed us clothing and gardened. I never once thought she was lazy. Chores still add up, housewives aren\u2019t lazy.", "Yeah, my brother and SIL have two young boys and they do laundry like 5 out of 7 days a week but even a load of laundry takes like a half hour at most of actively doing work.", "I do have a maid that comes three times a week and I do factor meals and a laundry service. That doesn\u2019t help with the mental load. My maid service doesn\u2019t call to renew my prescriptions. Or remind me my drivers license needs to be renewed. My factor meal delivery doesn\u2019t do dog food or treats. My laundry service doesn\u2019t notice I\u2019m getting low on socks and need to order more. There is SO MUCH more to being a SAHP than what you are considering.", "I\u2019m fine with all of that. If I have a SAHP I could easily Over Employ and make closer to 400k.", "I would not be legally giving away half of everything I own. Lawyers and pre-nups exist. I also do have a house keeper and a meal delivery service and I do laundry drop off. However, there is so much more that a spouse (considering mental load) can and does take care of. Does a maid service pick up your prescriptions or make sure that you had them renewed? Can a meal delivery service like Factor really make sure you are getting a variety of meals (I\u2019m pretty sure I eat the same 6 things every week)? Can a laundry service let you know you need more socks and pick them up for you? \n\nNo not at all. There is so many everyday normal tasks that a spouse would significantly help out with that just hiring out the individual tasks won\u2019t. I would pay more for a full on live in personal assistant than I would a ring and a contract.", "Well, at the very least we should tell women to have some sort of financial independence regardless of how they decide to live their life.

His in his early 20s did u have enough money to support 2 people and live a normal life in UR early 20s that is honestly unrealistic and I think this calling men broke for wanting a girl that works has gotten out of hand", "As OP said she isn't cooking or cleaning so really doesn't apply here. Nor does she want kids, so not really justified to just sit at home all day. There's only so much cleaning to be done.", "But this is literally not the case here? Op goes to college and we all know college students are not usually the financially strongest within our society, especially not on the US. I\u2019m assuming op has what he needs to take care of his own needs, but him then covering the needs of another adult human while he\u2019s still in college? I think that seems kinda unrealistic and unreasonable. Op is not forcing his girlfriend to work full time, he\u2019s being honest and direct with her. Mayhaps he could have chosen a less harsh approach, but he\u2019s just informing here of why her plans wouldn\u2019t realistically work out. Op should try and respect his gf wishes, but if he doesn\u2019t even wish to be in a relationship with a stay-at-home-wife type, I think it is completely unfair and unreasonable for op's gf to except him to financially care for the both of them.", "No I'm living with two toddlers. Do you have children? I literally have one to two loads of laundry a day. Load of dishwasher a day. I have two cats who shed all over the place and I'm terribly allergic so I have to vacuum everyday. I have two floors to vacuum. I have children who like to use bath paints and bath crayons that need to be washed off the wall.

Without parenting, she's also a part-time driver, cook, cleaner, etc. (With three children, there are always messes to clean up.)", "It drives me bonkers when people say that stuff about laundry.  They do it all the time on here with simple tasks too, and break them down into SO. MANY. STEPS. just to make it sound like more work than it is.\n\nThis is not an uncommon description of how to do laundry on here:\n\n1. collect everyone's laundry bins.\n2. sort each family member's laundry into whites and colors\n3. put person 1\u2019s colors in the machine.\n4. measure out 25mL of plant-based, hypoallergenic detergent that only comes from one store 30 minutes across town and is imported from europe\n5. pour detergent into machine\n6. measure out 15mL of fabric softener\n7. pour fabric softener into machine, taking extra care to ensure it goes in the fabric softener compartment\n8. close machine\n9. set machine to normal cycle with cold water\n10. press start\n11. when the cycle is finished, open machine\n12. open dryer door\n13. transfer all clothes from washer to dryer\n14. pull dryer sheet out of it\u2019s box\n15. place dryer sheet into dryer\n16. close dryer door\n17. set dryer to normal cycle\n18. press start\n19. when drying cycle is complete, open dryer door.\n20. place laundry into basket\n21. carry laundry to folding location\n22. sort laundry into piles of shirts, shorts, pants, undergarments, and iron/hang\n23. delicately fold and stack laundry into sorted piles.\n24. hang laundry that\u2019s going to be ironed.\n25. place bin of folded laundry into person 1\u2019s room\n\nRepeat ad nauseum with steps about adding bleach for the white stuff, and make sure to make it sound even worse because you do your sheets and towels every week too on top of the clothes.

For example, the various pushes to \u201celevate the voices\u201d of \u2018*insert group here*\u2019 over others. Membership of a demographic does not make you an expert on issues pertaining either solely or largely to them. \n\nFor example, who is more likely to understand the reasons behind the various income and asset gaps observable within a given economy?  A 25-year old sociology undergrad who happens to be a Latino bisexual woman, or a veteran economist who has conducted multiple meta-analyses alongside experts in other fields like psychologists and statisticians? In this scenario, the economist happens to be an older, married, straight man. \n\nThe way this conversation often pans out is the 25-year old learns nothing, resorts to name-calling, addresses none of the evidence presented, and accuses him of being biased due to his privilege. It\u2019s incredibly unproductive and leads to bubbles of social affirmation. \n\nConservatives can often be worse because their nature is to conserve, so my main problem with them they will never make meaningful social change because they are afraid of things that have not been demonstrated to harm people at all (gay marriage, abortion, lower voting age etc\u2026)", "it's so funny she accuses him of being sexist for not appreciating that it is work and he denies that and then a few sentences later he says \"nothing compared to an actual job\", which is her entire point, he doesn't respect it at all. If your SO is calling you a sexist, there's likely something to that. I don't think he's handling this situation like a \"real man\", what she said might have been warranted, especially since what he's told us is pretty damning, and he's likely painting his side of the picture much better than hers.", "It's possible she's been trying to get a degree & a career because she knows that's what you expect. Putting all her hopes into getting into Stanford feels like she's just trying to follow you. Right now your goal is to graduate. If she really doesn't want to finish school, she needs to do *something* with her life besides become your dependent. And tbh, if you do stay together for the long term, she would be the only one in your social circle you doesn't have a degree. People will make judgements about someone who doesn't have any career & doesn't have kids. \n\nWhere are her parents in all this?

Mine is 3 stories, and our rooms are on the top floor and on the west  side of the house, whereas the laundry room is in the basement  to the east.

Pre soaking set in stains a kid is trying to hide from you because it's their favorite shirt and don't want the shirt to get thrown away takes time.
