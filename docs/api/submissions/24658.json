{"id": 24658, "submission_id": "15rbgge", "title": "AITA for criticizing my boyfriend for staging a fake deportation scenario to test if I\u2019d marry him?", "selftext": "The other day, I (26M) was out of town attending a wedding with friends from college when I got a call from my boyfriend (29M). He told me he received a letter in the mail and that he was going to be deported. I\u2019ve been with him for 5 months, but until now, his immigration status wasn\u2019t something we had discussed, so this was one million percent out of the blue. He told me that he was basically hoping I could come back to town and marry him ASAP. \n\nI was freaking out. We\u2019ve told each other we looked forward to getting married and having kids in the future, but I indicated on several occasions that I did not want to get married for at least a few years until I was finished with grad school. Furthermore, I\u2019m 2 weeks away from moving overseas (without my bf) to begin a 10-month program, so I\u2019m already in an emotionally fragile state. So I didn\u2019t give him a hard no, but I told him I just wanted to discuss it later when I could process what was happening and be in a better frame of mind.\n\nSo basically, now I\u2019m at this wedding shitting myself. For the next hour, he\u2019s texting me saying that it\u2019s fine and that maybe we should just part ways since he didn\u2019t want to put me in that situation. Once I found a spot outside to hide, I called my boyfriend back and immediately breaking into hysterics. I didn\u2019t know what to do as I wanted to support him, but this was a huge shock to me as I wasn\u2019t even aware his immigration status was a thing at risk. \n\nThat\u2019s when he told me he made the whole thing up. While he did immigrate several years back, his citizenship status was already finalized, and there was no real risk of deportation. It was all basically a test of my loyalty and commitment to see if I would drop anything in an emergency to support him. He also criticized me for expecting him to let me know if his immigration status was in danger in the first place. \n\nSo I was in a state of shock. Apart from the fact that I was meant to be off on a relaxing weekend seeing my friends for one last time before moving halfway across the world for the next year, I also had literally just come out to my mom and my sister the day before and told her about me and my boyfriend\u2019s relationship, so as far as \u201cloyalty\u201d goes, I really felt I had just made a huge step in legitimizing our relationship. I continued to be hysterical and miserable, feeling like I got played but also that I was simultaneously a garbage boyfriend for \u201cfailing the test,\u201d and so I basically had a miserable time the rest of the wedding with my friends.\n\nBut now, I\u2019m wondering, AITA for criticizing my boyfriend on the scenario here? I do feel shitty for hesitating when he asked me to marry him. I really do feel I love him a lot, but I was not ready to jump in and save the day in such a scenario without question, and I\u2019m now questioning whether I\u2019m a bad boyfriend.", "created_utc": 1692057068, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rbgge/aita_for_criticizing_my_boyfriend_for_staging_a/", "score": 335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He told me he received a letter in the mail and that he was going to be deported. I\u2019ve been with him for 5 months, but until now, his immigration status wasn\u2019t something we had discussed, so this was one million percent out of the blue. He told me that he was basically hoping I could come back to town and marry him ASAP. \n\nI was freaking out. We\u2019ve told each other we looked forward to getting married and having kids in the future, but I indicated on several occasions that I did not want to get married for at least a few years until I was finished with grad school. Furthermore, I\u2019m 2 weeks away from moving overseas (without my bf) to begin a 10-month program, so I\u2019m already in an emotionally fragile state. So I didn\u2019t give him a hard no, but I told him I just wanted to discuss it later when I could process what was happening and be in a better frame of mind.\n\nSo basically, now I\u2019m at this wedding shitting myself. For the next hour, he\u2019s texting me saying that it\u2019s fine and that maybe we should just part ways since he didn\u2019t want to put me in that situation. Once I found a spot outside to hide, I called my boyfriend back and immediately breaking into hysterics. I didn\u2019t know what to do as I wanted to support him, but this was a huge shock to me as I wasn\u2019t even aware his immigration status was a thing at risk. \n\nThat\u2019s when he told me he made the whole thing up. While he did immigrate several years back, his citizenship status was already finalized, and there was no real risk of deportation. It was all basically a test of my loyalty and commitment to see if I would drop anything in an emergency to support him. He also criticized me for expecting him to let me know if his immigration status was in danger in the first place. \n\nSo I was in a state of shock. Apart from the fact that I was meant to be off on a relaxing weekend seeing my friends for one last time before moving halfway across the world for the next year, I also had literally just come out to my mom and my sister the day before and told her about me and my boyfriend\u2019s relationship, so as far as \u201cloyalty\u201d goes, I really felt I had just made a huge step in legitimizing our relationship. I continued to be hysterical and miserable, feeling like I got played but also that I was simultaneously a garbage boyfriend for \u201cfailing the test,\u201d and so I basically had a miserable time the rest of the wedding with my friends.\n\nBut now, I\u2019m wondering, AITA for criticizing my boyfriend on the scenario here? I do feel shitty for hesitating when he asked me to marry him. I really do feel I love him a lot, but I was not ready to jump in and save the day in such a scenario without question, and I\u2019m now questioning whether I\u2019m a bad boyfriend.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
