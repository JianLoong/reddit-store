That's basically the same as liking it, right?", "They're basically adults, not little kids. The party was planned more to cheer up the niece and sister because of the divorce. I don't see why a 20 year old can't be more mature in a situation like this. I'm more of a NTA judgement on this one.", "This isn't sharing, doesn't seem like her birthday was celebrated at all.", "AITA for not giving AF about what my daughter wants then trying to make her seem like the AH when she got upset? Also, AITA for disregarding her feelings and trying to make her feel worse?", "This really confused me but then I realised it was both of their birthday\u2019s. I thought it was just one. That\u2019s so mean. Poor girl.", "I fear there may be an additional sad element that could have been apart of the title. If their birthdays are a day apart- on whose birthday was this celebration?", "Exactly. It was only a birthday party for one of them.", "YTA op", "Even if it was not her birthday, that type of food is not for everyone.  I would have alternatives for people who don't care for it. I gave her a Y T A, just for being a poor host.", "All she wanted was burrito, not exactly a diva demand.", "Yeah being yelled at for wanting to use her own money on her birthday for her own food was the WTF moment of the entire post. Didn't even register to offer to pay for a burrito, hell buy her three, they don't cost that much, but even that was too much of a consideration.", "My guess is that it would make OP look bad for obviously disregarding her daughter\u2019s wants at the \u201c joint\u201d party.", "or even, if you could afford it, give your niece a party with the family like you did, and take your daughter out for a special night, with her tastes in mind. She is a bit older, and if you discussed it with her beforehand, she would be likely to agree. Then she wouldn't be an afterthought.", "I think OP was a little too busy trying to toot her own horn for how awesome she is for helping ease the pain of her sister's divorce on her niece that she forgot her daughter has likes and feelings like a real person.", "Next year is gonna be rough because they're turning 18 and 21 respectively. Two milestone birthdays a day a part, I hope OP isn't thinking of another joint party.", "It's worse OP didn't even bother to offer to pay for the burrito, like seriously, that didn't even register.", "So a piece of baguette and some water sounds good, with a $500.00 gift card to Circuit City as the present. That seems like a fun time.", "Who wouldn\u2019t be pissed if it\u2019s a joint birthday party but it was all about the cousin she got to chose the food the decorations if it\u2019s a joint birthday party the food should be chosen by the birthday kids not birthday kid", "So it was your nieces party. Not your daughters. Imagine treating your own kid like THIS much of an afterthought, and being surprised when theyre upset...", "You ignored your daughter's birthday to make your niece feel better.  You did the bare minimum of getting your daughter a cake on her birthday.  In your version of the story where you should look your best you come off sounding like an amazing aunt and a bad mother.  You can make the day special for your niece without ruining it for your daughter", "It\u2019s easy to be generous with other people\u2019s special days. YTA", "Yeah, definite YTA for not including your daughter in all of this. \n\nYou celebrated niece's birthday and expected daughter to accept that as her celebration, too.", "So you celebrated your niece's birthday and your daughter wasn't even a side thought. YTA.", "So why are you even here asking? You are the asshole and you should know it.", "Happy birthday, on your birthday we're doing all my favorite things. \n\nI am a random redditor who you don't know. I hope you enjoy them though, but don't worry I won't ask if you like any of them. And none of them can be at all catered to your wants, even if it's easy, as it might upset me. \n\nAlso, all of my friends and family will be there, and none of yours. But some of my friends and family may happy birthday to you too. So it's pretty much a great 50-50 split between us from my perspective.\n\nYTA", "Exactly. So... the party was for your niece then? Not your daughter?", "Why? It wasn't only her party. Obviously, they should have had an equal say.", "Yet you couldn\u2019t even get your daughter food she likes for example a burrito it wasn\u2019t even a tantrum she was upset about blatant favoritism YTA", "So you exploited your daughters birthday to excuse going over the top for your niece. This party clearly wasn\u2019t a joint celebration. You owe your daughter a apology", "YTA. And congratulations on letting your daughter know that your niece is more important than she is not just in your whole family, but to you too", "So what did your daughter get to pick out / what special things did you do for her on her SHARED birthday?? So since her parents are divorcing you ignore your child?? Weeeeeeirdo. YTA.", "So what did you - or anyone - plan that was supposed to be for your daughter's birthday?\n\nWas there anything at all included in the party specifically because your daughter would like it?", "Hope niece is the one checking in that your ok in old age and giving you grand babies right\u2026.. yeah.", "It was her birthday not your daughters?", "Wow. Your daughter got consolation prizes for her birthday. No wonder she\u2019s mad at you. What the hell is wrong with you?", "YTA for this fact alone", "I am breathless by the fact you need to \\*ask\\* if you were an asshole", "That still doesn't make it any better. You clearly only care about the niece and not your daughter. You straight up didn't care how your daughter felt and only cared about the niece", "So you are in the wrong then. It wasn\u2019t at all a party for your daughter, she was an afterthought at her own party, and you barely care. That\u2019s why she is upset at you.", "It sounds like a birthday party for two people is not the best time to \u201ccheer up\u201d one of them at the expense of the other. \n\nBurrito? What\u2019s the big deal about getting a birthday kid a burrito? Seems to be a small inexpensive request. \n\nIf your daughter requested a burrito during the event then she needs to adjust her expectations. If she requested before, see above.", "Yes, YTA. This was the only party your daughter got, and it wasn't aligned with any of her preferences.", "[removed]", "So now it's time to do something special for your own child? No????? You don't care enough to? That's weird considering she is your *child..* YTA", "So it was a joint birthday party, for both of them. Unless you were planning to throw a separate party for your daughter where she got to pick out what she wanted, YTA.", "What was the point of having a joint birthday party if you were going to mainly focus on one birthday kid? Your husband is an a**hole and the only one who sees what the adults did wrong is your youngest child. You all made it very clear who you were really celebrating so don't try to pretend this was a joint celebration for both girls.", "Have you comprehended that you are a massive AH yet?", "Yeah, you guys are horrible. Absolutely horrible", "YTA. It wasn\u2019t \u201cmainly\u201d for your niece. It was for your niece. Your own kid was an afterthought who was then chastised for daring to not be on board. Did you even talk about it beforehand, or did you just say, \u201cWe\u2019re throwing a joint party\u201d and then not ask her what she wanted? If you\u2019d behaved like an actual adult and caring parent and discussed with her before, maybe she would have been on board. But you apparently only looked after your niece\u2019s wants and then got mad when your daughter wasn\u2019t all happy and excited. Jeez.", "Reminds me of my poor husband who didn't like my meatloaf or meatballs, but ate them anyway. For years! I was so upset when he finally told me. Not because he didn't like them, but because he didn't say anything for so long! He's now in charge of the meatloaf and meatballs, which is awesome because his is so much better!", "I'll eat salad but that doesn't mean I like it, I only eat it because it's healthy but it's not enjoyable what so ever.", "I guess it is, if you're a dog?", "[deleted]", "Like when I bribe my child to eat cottage pie because you don\u2019t hate hate it and you\u2019ll eat it if I promise x y z.", "Not really\n\n\nI eat food that I would never choose but if you would serve it to me as only option at my birthday I would be upset too. \n\n\nSome people don't have a problem eating food they dislike.", "Maybe because the party was planned so they can both enjoy it, its not everyday that you turn 20, i don't see why they couldn't have mixed foods since the girls don't share the same taste, and it doesn't matter what age you are, its pretty harsh to know your whole bday was arranged so someone else can enjoy it and not you, and like im saying there was absolutely nothing wrong with mixing foods, and not have the bday girl go home hungry on her bday.", "because her own parents are throwing a birthday party for someone else, saying it's for her too, and then completely disregarding her feelings? obviously that hurts, regardless of age.", "Then what\u2019s the problem with them ordering food the 20 likes instead of food she dislikes", "She didn't try to ruin anything. Her having a burrito would have made 0 difference to the nieces celebration.", "You also missed the part in the comments where OP said this was basically a party for both girls, but her daughter got pretty much ignored (except for cutting a cake of her own).", "It was k birthday and all she was doing was phoning in food she liked if the mother hadn\u2019t said anything there be no trouble made", "But burritos are sooooo much more expensive than sushi /s", "Yeah I mean- it\u2019s a *burrito.* Practically the most inexpensive, self-contained, single-servingest food she could have asked for. One person *whose birthday it is* eating a burrito by herself is not going to have ANY impact on anyone else.", "She is 21 next year be interesting to see if she even wants a family party! If I was her I would do my own thing, get together with my friends and go out and have a blast!", "The fact the OP sees this as absolutely no big deal that everything her daughter wanted was shoved aside in favor of the other girl is a pretty big indication this has been happening her entire life. The fact that OP reacted with name-calling and shaming is also likely a life-long habit.\n\nYeah, I would not be surprised in the slightest if this young woman goes NC at the first available opportunity.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They could have saved money by ordering half burritos and half sushi and letting everyone pick. Personally I'd take both and be all \"this is the best day of my liiiiiiife\" but OP had to dismiss her daughter ON HER BIRTHDAY.
