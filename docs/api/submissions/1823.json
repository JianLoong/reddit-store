I\u2019m a 22 year old and I\u2019ve been living on my own since I was 17. My mom kicked me out at 17 bc she didn\u2019t agree with the boy I was dating. So I moved in with him for a year until he got physically and mentally abusive. \n\nMy mom is a \u201chigh strung\u201d Christian, who used to be in med school and my dad is not so much and has worked trade all his life. He believes but they just have different views about nearly everything. My mom is against all smoking, drugs, drinking etc. My dad, is a smoker of both herb and cigarettes. I also smoke herb for my anxiety and ptsd but my mom is heavily against. \n\nI moved back in with my parents at the beginning of 2019 just until I could settle some debts from the relationship. When I moved back in; my parents kept a curfew on me of 10pm for a 20y/o, there were constant fights, my mom got mad and would blame my smoking on everything and tell me i wasn\u2019t going to get to go on MY senior trip and family vacation. She has told me I won\u2019t get those promises until I \u201cclean up\u201d. \n\nI moved out again after about 6 months. I moved in with a friend, we had our tiffs. So i moved into a van for 6 months until I could get an apartment. \nFast forward to now. I\u2019ve been living on my own for 4 years now. My mom quit her job to take care of my Memaw who passed of dementia in May 2022 and my mom has still yet to get a job. My brother (26) still lives at home and doesn\u2019t contribute whatsoever. Memaw helped financially with the house bc she lived with us all my life and now my parents are down 2 incomes, mom\u2019s and memaw\u2019s. They know my current boyfriend just got promoted to store manager, which of course came with a raise, and have since asked for us to move in to help financially. \n\nI\u2019m at a loss bc I\u2019d love to help them and return the help they gave me from my ex but I also know the toxic environment I\u2019d be moving back into. \nMy mom has always pushed me to do more than i believe i can achieve and I\u2019m not made at her. I know she\u2019s grieving from the loss of her mother but we have such clashing personalities now I don\u2019t want to make everyone miserable. \n\nAm I the asshole for not moving back in and helping?\n\nEDIT: my dad has his own business. my brother and dad\u2019s friend both work for my dad. my dad says they don\u2019t contribute enough/at all. So there\u2019s already 4 capable adults living at the house they\u2019re trying to pay for. \n\nWhile I\u2019m trying to make plans and save for my next plans in life. My own land and home.\nThey gave me 3 options; we can build a tiny home in the backyard, close the back living area and bedroom off as an in-law suite for us, or we could get a camper and hook up to their house. \nIf anything, I\u2019m leaning towards the camper but I still think we\u2019ll just be too close for comfort unfortunately): \nI hate to say it bc I love my mom, I\u2019m not mad at her, I just don\u2019t want to take on something that won\u2019t benefit me in the long run.", "created_utc": 1667930672, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yptrqx/aita_for_not_moving_back_in_and_helping_my/", "score": 276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn\u2019t sound like good idea given how living with them has gone in the past. If you want to help, there\u2019s other ways to do it that don\u2019t involve moving in with them. My older sister was constantly relying on my parents to bail them out because her loser husband couldn\u2019t keep a job, and she didn\u2019t have the work ethic to get a decent job for herself. Eventually I helped her get a better job, and I helped them by sending practical gifts they would like and appreciate. Fun clothes for the kids, gift baskets of their favorite fruit for the holidays, nice body washes and lotions. Things that were nice, but also useful that could take the edge off of other bills.
