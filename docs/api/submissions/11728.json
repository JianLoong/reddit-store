Dude had a nosebleed and also passed tf out for apparently no reason?? Firstly that sounds like something they shouldve called an ambulance for immediately when it happened and the fact they didnt is....concerning. but what i really wanna know is your mothers opinion on it all. Like i fully appreciate you thinking about keeping her new car clean and everything but what would she have done and why and also how do you feel about her reasoning. \n\nCos like. im confident that if somebody was suddenly dizzy, got a nosebleed and also was passed out for a time my only priority would be getting them to a medical professional. Like i would rather overreact and them be completely fine then them suddenly having an aneurysm or something feel me?? \n\nAlso, this is a lesser issue but youve basically told your gf that the people important to her dont matter very much to you. Like, i dont have much to say about how you treated what i think was very probably a medical emergency cos none of them seemed to have thought it was one either, but you did very much just tell her that you dont value the people she does all that much. Which is like. Not great, especially 3 years in. \n\nUnless your mum is the fully unreasonable type i really dont think the issue was that serious. i dont even think he wouldve messed up her car unless he was actively bleeding....but if he was not helping actually just makes you worse in this situation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
