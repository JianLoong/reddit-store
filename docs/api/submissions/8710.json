Have you asked your wife what she is getting out of the friendship? It must be flattering to be around someone who has a thing for her, even if she is making every bi woman on the planet look bad by her lack of respect for monogamous relationships.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I wouldn't blame you if you told your wife that if it were up to you, she wouldn't see them anymore either. They are totally disrespecting the both of you, and what might be worse is that they are disrespecting her \"no\". I'd seriously be worried that they ply her with drug or alcohol and sexually assault her. Those people are trash", "NTA, your wife is a huge asshole for not ending the friendship then and there.", "NTA. Put the shoe on the other foot. If you had a female friend who kept trying to get you to have sex with her, would your wife be ok with you continuing to hang out with that \u2018friend\u2019?", "NTA... the lack of respect for clear boundaries indicates this woman is not a friend at all.  She clearly does not have your wife's best interests in mind.", "NTA-no way in hell I would spend time with that so called friend who is trying to undermine your relationship.  Fingers crossed your wife comes to her senses and sees what they are doing.", "NTA, I would try to have a conversation about how you can support your wife without having to be around those AH, make it clear to her that you want to support her, but that its something that makes you uncomfortable.\n\nAlso you really need to discuss some safety measures that she is comfortable with if she is going to see them again. Their disregard for her NO, is a red flag and I could see them trying to push harder.", "Wait, this friend keeps pushing your wife to do something she's repeatedly said she didn't want to. You say you don't want to hang out with this boundary-stomper and your wife thinks you're an asshole? What?", "NTA - The friend is not respecting any boundary set, and the BF is just encouraging it.", "NTA.  It's fine if you wife wants to deal with this bs, but it is not ok for her to expect you to put up with it.", "NTA\n\nNot sure why your wife is upset with you - you're not telling her who to hang out with.  You've set a boundary - you don't want to associate people who disrespect You and your wife.  She's being disrespected by them even more than you are ie she's told this woman NO on numerous occasions and this 'friend' keeps pushing, now this strange man is trying to coerce her.  \n\nIt sounds like your wife is afraid that if YOU aren't there with the 3 of them, that those 2 could do something to her against her will.  Honestly that's a real possibility ie getting her drunk/ drugging her drink/ driving her somewhere and not letting her leave etc that sounds dramatic but esp this new dude sounds sketchy AF.  So if THAT is what's in the back of your wife's mind - THAT should tell her to break off that relationship asap.  If one needs a 'body guard' to protect themself from a 'friend' that friendship is over.\n\nSit down with your wife and have another conversation about this.  It's actually ok to tell her that while you'll respect whatever decision she makes - after this last incident you really don't like or TRUST those people, and that from your POV it this woman genuinely cared for your wife as a friend vs looking at her as a sexual play thing, she'd respect your wife's NO, and she'd have shut her BF down immediately for being inappropriate.  You don't want to be around them because you don't want to have to pretend that their rude, and inappropriate suggestions and behavior are normal - they are not.", "Any time someone tries to convince a person in a relationship to cheat, it is both people\u2019s problem: both the person they\u2019re attempting to convince to cheat, and that person\u2019s partner. How your wife decides to handle this will be a defining moment in your relationship, along with your response. If you know that a certain action from her would result in a negative action from you, communicate that. Even if she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, present her with the facts.", "NTA. I just hope the next time your wife is out with these \"friends\" that she never lets her drinks out of her sight. Just sayin'.", "NTA She can do what she wants. You can do what you want.\n\nWhy would she EVER expect you to hang out with someone who continually encourages her to cheat on you? And why is she continuing to hang out with people who don\u2019t understand that no means no?\n\nIt\u2019s difficult for me to believe that she doesn\u2019t understand your POV.", "> it's her problem to handle and I just need to be there for her\n\nNTA\n\nIt isn't just her problem. It is your problem. You have good reason to dislike her \"friend\" and you don't need to hang out with people you dislike.\n\nHer friend:\n\n* Bad mouthed you\n* Disrespected your relationship with your wife by encouraging your wife to cheat on you", "NTA and you need to have a serious convo with your wife. As a survivor of SA this is triggering me badly I\u2019d hate for her to go out one night with them alone and something happens. No one should have to repeat the word no ever and no spouse should be disrespected by their partners friends. Talk with your wife set clear boundaries and let her know there will be consequences for crossing those boundaries. If these are the ppl she wants in her life and are choosing those relationships over your peace you you may want to start thinking about separation with therapy. Also record and document everything when it comes to these ppl. If your wife chooses to end those relationships they seem like the type to retaliate document everything.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NEED to speak with your wife on this.\n\nhave a blessed day.", "NTA I don't see what you're doing wrong... They're making BOTH of you uncomfortable. Why is she trying to subject you to that by saying you're an AH if you don't? You're not even telling her *she* shouldn't hang out with them, which would be controlling but honestly understandable if they're that pushy. I got uncomfortable just reading this. How do you sit through the whole show with them bugging you to fuck them? \n\nOf course they're going to keep bugging her, more so when you're not around anymore. Maybe that's what your wife is actually upset about, that they'll only bug her when you're not around, and she wants her buffer back.

What is causing her to want to keep a toxic friendship?\n\nIt's OK to tell your wife that you find her continuing this friendship to be disrespectful to your marriage. Your wife cheated on you with this person. She needs to make a decision about the marriage. \n\nIt's an open marriage or it's not, but you both need to be on the same page.", "Honestly, you would be in your rights to say \"I would like you to not be friends with her anymore\" and she might even be glad to hear it.", "I've told her that I'm sorry she feels that way and personally if the roles were reversed I'd already have cut ties, but I understand she's one of her few friends.

She says she trusts me and would trust me to handle it, but if I wanted her to she would still hang out with them", "Seriously agreed. The friend is a gigantic asshole for this, and the wife's reaction is equally as bizarre and terrible as the whole situation.", "Make sure to properly communicate that to your wife. Do you know why she isn't cutting contact? Does she not see the reality of the situation? I'm very conflict avoiding and I know it can be really hard to cut off a friend, even after they do something this shitty. She might need a reality check.\n\nOr do you think she actually enjoys the attention?", "This pushy behavior from her friend\u2019s bf is probably why your wife wants you around (for her safety).

You need to be straight about your feelings and POV.   \n\nIt's not fair to say 'I support your decisions' and then if a decision turns out to be a bad one - you get mad and leave.  Basically SPEAK UP you might actually save your wife from sexual assault.", "One thing I would make sure is clear in your communication is that this isn't because you distrust your wife, but because you detest her friend.", "But that's the thing - You trust your Wife.  You know she's not interested in getting it on with her friend, and certainly not a 3way with the new creeper BF.  That's not the problem.  The issue is that those 2 have no boundaries.  If that woman were your wife's tru Friend she wouldn't be bad mouthing you, she wouldn't be hitting on her at all, and if her BF said something inappropriate she'd stop that right away with 'Thats not on the table with X, so no more of that talk'", "Trust is great, but why does she continue to hang out with someone intent on getting her into bed?  At the very least, it is disrespectful to you.", "How convenient, that in a hypothetical that reflects your exact situation your wife would be totally okay with the exact course of action she\u2019s currently taking."]}
