It's honestly sounding like you were better off seperated if this is her mentality towards \"I have a reasonable boundary of Not wanting to be around people who try and convince you to cheat.\" is \"Well that's not really a reasonable boundary and you're an asshole for having it and not disregarding it because I want to be around people who do that.\"", "NTA You can\u2019t force her to cut the frenemy out, but you certainly don\u2019t have to interact with either of those two ever again.

Good on your wife for telling you and getting you to pick her up, but she should\u2019ve dropped that friend months ago when she expressed her unhappiness about y\u2019all getting back together. I would say \u2018unless you were controlling or abusive\u2019 but it\u2019s clear the friend was only upset because she\u2019s into your wife. I know you don\u2019t want to tell your wife what to do or who to be friends with and I would usually cheer this. However, this too much. My husband also doesn\u2019t tell me what to do or who to be friends with, but he will express when he\u2014rarely\u2014feels uncomfortable with one of my friends. Usually that friend has expressed feelings for me or disinterest in the fact that I\u2019m married and have a family. Again, it\u2019s rarely occurred, but one time when it did it was a bi friend of mine and the one time she met my husband she was incredibly rude to him. She was my friend though and we were \u2018connected through trauma\u2019 so I stupidly tried to excuse it until he explained how uncomfortable and angry he was. I couldn\u2019t believe I had put him in a situation like that\u2014he would\u2019ve never done that to me.

By my definition, not interfering *is* you letting her handle it, and honestly probably you being too nice about it. This isn't a personality conflict, it's blatant disrespect to you and her and your relationship. Frankly I'd be setting a firm boundary and I wouldn't be sticking around if she stayed friends with them. She seems to be under the impression that she can set a boundary and they'll respect it and she can keep her friendship. But if they weren't respecting it when she declined multiple times, they aren't about to start now and I hate to be the one to say it but they seem the types to move to more coercive tactics like getting her drunk.

So by \"support\" she knows I mean I won't physically stop her even if I disagree but yes if she cannot listen to someone who genuinely cares about her well-being and keeps putting herself into a situation I have warned her about then I can say it's quite fair.\n\nI've told her I'm concerned about her being drugged or otherwise taken advantage of bc she's hell bent on seeing the best in people and so far all she's said is she will only meet her friend if the guy isn't there and if he shows up she will leave.", "I agree and have expressed that concern", "I'm not sure I understand why your wife wants to keep such a toxic friend.
