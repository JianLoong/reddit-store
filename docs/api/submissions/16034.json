And what's important is not supporting your sister, who needs her family more than ever right now,  it's getting access the baby so you can immerse your self in cool unclehood.    Jenn is not forcing you or anyone else to choose, Liz did that and she is using her baby as an incentive for everyone to accept her unconscionable behavior.

You chose your side.", "YTA, and I don't buy the way you are framing the issue (i.e. \"The child is innocent\"). Yes, she is innocent, but it is a total strawman argument. \n\nIn a just situation, you all should have sided with Jenn and gone NC with Liz the moment you all found out about the betrayal, and that is the end of it. She is not your sister, her daughter is not your niece, and the niece is not being hurt by you not seeing her, because you are not her uncle.\n\nAt this point, Liz's daughter is no more your niece then a stranger. You are not hurting Liz's daughter. They made their choice and will have to live with the remaining family they have left on the husband's side of the family. \n\nIt really is that simple. At this point, you are pretty much trying to gaslight Jenn into thinking she is making you hurt an innocent child, which makes this an extreme YTA. But thank god Jenn can see through your BS and is ready to go NC with you, which is exactly what she should do if you maintain a relationship with Liz and this niece.", "YWBTA. How is a newborn niece you never met more important than your sister Jenn? I get that your niece is innocent, but Liz did something unforgivable, she made her choice and now she should deal with the consequences of them. Having people surround her for the baby is the same as condoning her actions just because she got pregnant. Jenn is completely justified on going NC with the whole family if they accept Liz even if it is just \"for the baby\". Liz is the one who chose to break the family with her actions. Has Liz even shown proper remorse and regrets for her actions? Has she even tried to fix the long-term lasting damage she did to Jenn? And just an apology wouldn't cut it either.   \n\nThe baby isn't gonna realize it lost an uncle, but your sister will realize you chose a baby you never met over her. Honestly, the fact you even said Liz was a better fit for Jenn's fiance makes you an AH. I seriously hope you never said that in front of Jenn. I just feel bad for Jenn in all this mess.", "Well, Jenn will  have her vindication. I have no doubt that the ex fiance is going to cheat on Liz eventually because he is a boundary stomper, screwing his fiances sister. Nothing will hold him back from someone unrelated. Once a cheater, always a cheater.", "YTA If they fell in love under nonideal circumstances, he should have broken up with Jenn before doing the horizontal tango with Liz.

But suppose what happened to Jenn happen to you, how would you feel? This is betrayal at its worst. I would feel the same way Jenn does. But again it\u2019s your choice to choose and your consequence to bare.", "YTA\n\nThere are certain people that should always be off-limits to start a relationship with and your sibling\u2019s partner is at the top of that list. There is never a reason that you should allow yourself to become that attached to someone that is dating, engaged or married to a close relative.\n\nHow would you feel if you found out your dad was sleeping with your mom\u2019s sister behind her back and got her pregnant? Now, you are going to have a sibling/cousin but how would your mom feel? How would holidays work? Would you expect to be one big happy family? No. It\u2019s not realistic. When one person in the family betrays another one by sleeping with their partner, it is definitely going to change the entire dynamic of the family. In the above scenario, would you expect your mom to suck it up and accept the child that her husband left her to have with your aunt? Would you expect her to sit down over Christmas dinner with them? It\u2019s not only a betrayal, it\u2019s a betrayal that will be rubbed in her face for the rest of her life. \n\nYou say that your they couldn\u2019t help who they fell in love with. Yes they could. You put distance between you both and respect your sister and your partner. Is the child to blame? No, but it will be a constant reminder. Again, who should be punished - the innocent victim or the two cheaters? I honestly think that the child by default should not be rubbed in her face. The cheaters should have been the ones ostracized not coddled because they are a better fit anyway. There was no excuse. \n\nHow would you feel if you found out that your dad was sleeping with your girlfriend and had gotten her pregnant? Think on that for awhile and see if that changes your thoughts on this.", "NTA\n\nBut Jenn isn't TA either for threatening to go NC with the whole family. Seriously she got screwed over. She shouldn't have to deal with you all if she doesn't want to. The only AH's here are Liz and her husband.", "I can't come to a judgement but if that happened in my family, I wouldn't consider the sister who did such a disgusting thing a sister anymore, there's just no redeeming something like that.", "Yta yta yta yta yta yta", "I hate stories like this. Seriously, there are millions of people in the world and people think it\u2019s okay to cheat with siblings?! \nOP your sister has no one in her corner. She was betrayed by the person who was supposed to be her partner, the person she wanted to spend the rest of her life with. On top of that she was betrayed by her TWIN sister! Sure she will move on and hopefully live her best life but right now she is hurting. Yes there is an innocent baby in the mix but that baby has two parents and other family members in their corner.

You are definitely being out in a position where all of your options suck. The baby gives you and your parents have good reasons to put it all behind you and forgive Liz.  That is already ethically unfortunate because what Liz did was pretty unforgivable. Jenn definitely does not have any good reason to forgive her sister here. She will probably always be hurt by this and you guys are unfortunately going to be siding with Liz for access to the baby. You will all be actively hurting Jenn while doing this. Again, I see and understand your reasoning considering that the baby is innocent. But the parents aren\u2019t and they\u2019re just going to be let off the hook. So at the end of the day Jenn is betrayed by everyone because Liz and her ex can hide behind their baby and any future kids. I feel so incredibly sorry for her. Maybe one day she will find a way to forgive her sister but she doesn\u2019t seem to have any reason to and you can\u2019t just expect people to be that saintly.\n\nYour options really do just suck here. I\u2019m sorry.", "NTA but I have to know....is Liz remorseful for hurting Jen? While the niece does deserve a family, if Liz is in fact proud of her affair, then I understand Jen's anger that Liz gets to have everything and face no repercussions.", "YTA. Even if the niece is innocent I would ALWAYS value my sister more, sorry not sorry. Especially in this case. Just stop saying you understand your sister or want to be there for her, you obviously don\u2019t and your opinion on how \u201cLiz is a better fit with him\u201d makes you even more of an AH. If I was Jenn you all would be dead to me.", "NTA and Jenn is NTA. I only fault Liz and the cheater. You're right. It's not the baby's fault and this shouldn't be dividing the family. All I can say is, let Jenn go NC for awhile. Give her the space she needs and hopefully in time, she'll come around to you and your parents. She doesn't have to meet the baby, she can stay NC with Liz and what's his face. It's probably going to be easier if she does.", "NTA. You are 100% right that this baby is innocent. At the same time your sister is 100% right to feel betrayed and go nc. It totally sucks, but she has every right to still feel betrayed.", "NTA Niece doesn\u2019t deserve to be cast out from the family due to her parents being assholes.\n\nJenn is also NTA because with Liz being her twin, it would be hard not to look at her niece and know that her OWN child could have looked exactly like that if Fianc\u00e9 had not cheated. If she knows she would not be able to look at that child without feeling negative about her, it\u2019s reasonable for her to not want to be in her life. It IS AH behavior for her to try and dictate that you and your parents shouldn\u2019t have a relationship with your niece though.", "NTA\n\nThe affair isn't your nieces fault. \n\nI understand if your sister Jenn doesn't wasn't to meet her, but you don't have to feel the same way.", "NTA. Your niece has done nothing wrong and shouldn't be denied a relationship with her family. I understand your sister has been seriously betrayed by her sister but that does give her the right to force ultimatums on people.", "NTA. You shouldn\u2019t have to choose.", "NTA and your sister sadly is asking the family to pick one over the other. She needs to move on and not hold it against anyone who still sees the niece because grandparents will put the needs of the child first...so she will be at all family events.

Your sister would be an AH for blaming anyone but the couple.", "NTA. I don\u2019t want to call Jenn an AH given what she went through. And it is understandable that she has no desire to have her twin, ex fianc\u00e9 and niece in her life. However, what happened is between her, her ex fianc\u00e9 and Liz. The child is innocent and should have the chance to know her family.", "You're not an asshole. And, neither is Jen. Unreasonable , perhaps, to expect the grandparents and uncle of the baby to completely ignore and disregard the child, that's not realistic. But given the emotional duress that is to be expected. I mean out things in her perspective, and you can see why she feels this way. Especially since that's her twin. Like imagine. \n\nI think that it sucks that Jen wants to go NC more so for her sake because she could be losing a support system (assuming you guys are a good support system). \n\nReally, the fact if the matter is.

She's supposed to just suck it up even though they hurt her in one of the worst possible ways? Her family is choosing the cheaters because they happen to have a child together. I don't blame Jenn at all for going NC. She needs to for her own mental health and then build her own family from people she can trust not to abandon her because she should just get over being betrayed.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like that is what she is asking. Honestly, if anything OP seems to lean closest to AH. He sounds like he\u2019s tired of her being hurt and just wants to move on. She just wants someone in her family to choose her. Wanting to be chosen doesn\u2019t make you an AH. The entire family chose her sister (and her niece) and there appears to be no negative consequences for her infidelity. Not really sure what you would expect her to do at this point.", "She can maintain a relationship without having to go to that stuff.  And if she wants to go NC with everyone that\u2019s a choice.  What does she expect her brother and parents to do?   Go NC with them along with her?   being wronged and hurt doesn\u2019t make you immune to being an asshole.", "Are you missing the fact from the title that he hasn\u2019t even met his niece yet?  She is threatening NC over him meeting his niece.  He said he wants to move on and be a good uncle. He never said she had to move on.", "So maintain a relationship but never be able to go to any family event? That's not a relationship. That's family expecting her to just get over it and forgive them or stuck it up. Most people can't do that.", "He wants to move on though. He just wants it to be over. He\u2019s already chosen the other sister. She has no one now. She isn\u2019t an asshole for wanting to keep the one family member she had left. Is the niece in the middle of it? Yeah, but that does not make her an AH. The niece is connected to the sister that betrayed her. No one can have a relationship with the niece and not have a relationship with her mother. \n\nHe isn\u2019t an AH for wanting to move on but she isn\u2019t an AH either. Wtf is she supposed to do? She has lost her entire family. I have no idea what I would do in that situation.", "the underlying assumption in this thread is this woman is being ostracized when there is no evidence of that.  all we know is she is refusing contact with her sisters new family (understandable) and then doing an ultimatum with the rest of her family.  You don\u2019t have to have all or nothing \u201cfamily events\u201d where everyone has to go.  I haven\u2019t done one of those with my family in over 10 years, but still hang out with some of them sometimes", "She\u2019s choosing to have no family left.  Yes, she was betrayed by her sister and fianc\u00e9, not by her brother or parents.  All sorts of people maintain relationships with mutual friends/family after cutting someone off.  I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do in that situation either. Maybe I\u2019d do the same thing as her, but if I did I would be an asshole for it.", "How does she maintain a relationship with her family? She won't be able to go to any family events because the child is more important to the family than her, and the child comes with her parents who betrayed Jenn.", "It\u2019s perfectly possible to maintain a relationship with people who are maintaining relationships with people you don\u2019t talk to.  I\u2019ve been doing that my whole life.  You don\u2019t all have to be in the same place at the same time.", "YTA - You\u2019re choosing one sister over the other and blaming it on a baby, cause you\u2019re a coward who just wants things back to \u201cnormal\u201d. I\u2019d go NC and hope you get cheated on.", "Yta.", "Liz is a unique kind of evil and it seems like you just want to accept her diabolical behavior. Don\u2019t hide behind being a good uncle. YTA unless the only way you meet the kid is in the absence of her shit parents.", "YTA, your parents are assholes, the cheaters are the worst of assholes. Liz and the boyfriend chose to do something that caused catastrophic damage to the family unit. They should be out of the family. It's pretty disgusting that a child you don't even know is more important to you than Jenn. Every holiday, every birthday, every get together Jenn would have to choose whether to go and have her face rubbed in it or stay away because it seems that you will all choose Liz and this baby. Once you choose the baby what more point is there for Jenn to remain in contact with you? You're a moral failure who thinks \"love\" can justify total betrayal. Literally the only people in this story that come off at all sympathetic are Jenn and the baby.", "NTA for wanting to be an uncle to your niece.  YTA for your attitude about the whole thing.\n\n\nWhile I certainly can understand Jenn's pain with this betrayal, I will never tolerate the notion that an innocent child is somehow supposed to be banished from her family because of the actions of the parents.  Such an idea is beyond barbaric.", "NTA,\n\nI will always understand why Jenn is angry though. Liz gets pregnant and everyone forgets about the cheating and betrayal. \nFor you OP it's your niece who is innocent and deserves family in her life despite her parents mistake.", "No judgement because this fd up.", "YTA, and so is the rest of your family. \n\nEvery single family event will be a stab in the guts for your innocent sister. \n\nPersonally, I'd walk away from anyone condoning this. Including my parents.", "YTA", "YTA. I'm sorry, but there's a LOT of consent that goes into having an affair if that magnitude. It doesn't just \"happen\".  I get it, people fall in love but then they CHOSE to kiss, have sex, have sex again and again without telling Jenn.  Sorry but that's vile and something they BOTH had plenty of opportunities to stop and not have a long term affair that only came to light with a pregnancy. If he wanted Liz not Jenn then dump Jenn. Don't fuck her sister for god knows how long then only grow a spine when there's no way out because she's pregnant. \n\nAnswer this - If Liz didn't get pregnant, would he have married Jenn and continued the affair? \n\nI get this sucks for you - you have a niece you haven't met, your family is torn apart and you want things to go back to normal.   But I get the feeling you want to sweep stuff under the rug.  It's easiest to ignore Jenn's feelings and pretend like Liz and BIL are actually nice people because you don't really want to deal with the fallout.  You want to have your cake and eat it too.  \n\nI don't have an answer here.  But Jenn is very much well within her rights to never speak to you again over this.  She's not overreacting and the fact you don't understand just how much of a betrayal on every single level this affair was shows how little love and care you have for her. \n\nChoose whichever one you want.  But you can't have both. And you should be capable of understanding why.", "YTA. Not for meeting your niece. But for your BS sometimes people just fall in love rhetoric. What the hell kind of excuses that? I don't care what anybody tells you in any romance story or anime you watch but people don't just look at each other than something fall in love. Lust? Yes. And the fact that they are sisters. Your sisters. Your twin sister who knows her sister the best actively spent time with her sister's husband. And the moment she knew she was attracted to Tim she continued on that line. And the moment she was substantly flirting with him and he was subtly throwing back she continued. She never once stopped it. She never once stopped spending time with him. She actively sought him out and made moves on him and reciprocated those moves. And she got off with a man who is currently getting off with her sister. And then they just fell in love cuz I guess according to you sometimes people just fall in love and I just can't help it golly! I mean they can help the low key flirting as it slowly evolved into big flirting and then involved into subtle intimacy which turned into physical intimacy which turned into screwing. So why don't think that you are in the wrong for wanting to see your niece your whole attitude about this is horrifying to me. And I feel sorry for any woman you hook up with who thinks that you might be in love with her and I hope you warn her that even though you're in love with her now you might accidentally fall in love with someone all of a sudden one day and cheat on her. Cuz that's just what happens.", "How much you want to make a bet OP\u2019s family are Christians? How can you type this all out and not know that you are an asshole?!", "They all want to gloss over this to have an easier life especially as there\u2019s a child involved whose life they want to be involved in. But Jen is being shafted by everyone and she\u2019s the only one having to deal with any consequences. \n\nAnd OP stop glossing over what they did with the whole \u201cfell in love under less than ideal circumstances and are a much better fit\u201d. They made active choices to betray Jen. She didn\u2019t cause this situation, they did. You family had to unfortunately find a way to navigate this situation that\u2019s also fair to Jen because Liz broke your family and it\u2019s never going to be the same.", "Twin sister too.", "I agree with this. The person who should be feeling the most consequence in this situation is Liz. Her and hubby (cheater) should be the ones who don't attend family events. The rest of the family could still choose to see them, and see the child of the relationship, but Liz and hubby should never be at the same event as Jenn ever again.\n\nJenn shouldn't have to pay any more of a price for this situation than she already has.", "I took it to mean that he thinks the fiance should have ended things with Jen first, before he did anything with Liz. But you might be right.", "Or that the twin who was cheated on should get over it. This is a huge betrayal, and I don\u2019t blame the cheated on twin for wanting to go NC. This idea that \u201cthey couldn\u2019t help it\u201d is total BS. They chose to cheat. The cheating twin could have chosen her twin over the BF. The BF could have broken up with the cheated on twin and walked away. Frankly I think the cheated on twin should go NC, she deserves better than the AH in her family.", "Exactly! He can choose whatever, but that paragraph says a lot about his character makes him the AH", "I really feel he is hiding a lot .. the para proves that he is actually okay with cheating... I feel the whole family thinks it's okay to cheat so they not only want to Accept the neice but Liz and her bf too and act like nothing happened...", "She\u2019s not an AH for not wanting to deal with the product of an affair her twin had with her BF. She needs to look out for herself, and her mental well being, because her family doesn\u2019t seem to care about her  well being."]}
