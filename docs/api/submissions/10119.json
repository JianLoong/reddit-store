I thought I was doing the most I could but now I know I'm not. If I take him, I'm wring. If I don't I'm wrong. I don't want people to think Im some evil woman who would bully a toddler, but I feel like one. I won't change my decision but I feel worse off than ever. I am a bad person and nothing can change that in my heart. I don't even wanna face my mom or Mara, because I feel so.much shame. I will answer more questions later, I need to take my meds. \n\nI (19f) I took everyone's messages and felt very badly, guilty and anxiety ridden. I accepted all judgments not just the one's in my favor. I spent the entire day at my classes checking my laptop in between notes not sure what to do or say. I was debating on whether to talk directly to my mom or wait. When I got home she was waiting and I felt so nervous. I listened as she talked to my grandmother in the background and did my class work still to nervous to speak.\n\nBut eventually, I said fuck it and spoke up. I had to talk to her anyway for school. I asked what had changed and she looked sad. She said would i be fine with him staying for a few days and I knew if I said no that wouldn't be right. I said yes and asked maybe we can get him soon, we are going on vacation. My mom said she had talked it over with Mara already and she agreed to send him down when she feels like it. \n\nShe will pay for sending him down to and will make sure he's behaved. I think my change in decision made the choice easier for her. I said that I'm open to him staying more and she agreed saying possibly if he's behaved he can stay more. And I felt no better afterwards. Yes, I helped her make the choice but I still felt bad. I am not very good with these things and I just laid in bed feeling sick.\n\nNext day, wasn't feeling much better. I came home again and made sure to swallow my anxiety and ask again. I had to make sure she remembered. She said it was still happening and now that she knew I was comfortable with it, she was more on board the before. My mom isn't gonna make me watch him or anything. I think Mara will get a nice break for a few days outta the year. \n\nI am not calling any authorities to step in, I don't feel comfortable with it. I am already on edge and essentially was a wreck today at class. I don't hate Mara I just don't get her. She was favored not in a \"She gets some more things because shes older\" but in a literal \"She gets your things in front you, your bedroom and gets to eat things you can't because she's the favorite\". This was until she got pregnant as then things changed. \n\nMy aunt cannot get him back I may add, for us to help. My mom made that perfectly clear. The moment Mara runs to her when she's out of rehab we are done. I think that's fair. Mara also had help, she wasn't abandoned. Multiple family members send her money which she used for insta or babysitting. I don't think i can do more as I am not close to her. All I can do is push for my mom to stay active in what she already did out of her own selflessness. \n\nWhy did Mara have to do it? Why did she have to help? My mother helped for so long, I didn't want her to honestly. I wanted my mom to stop putting her life on hold for kids who didn't go to school, didn't clean, didn't listen (that was on me because why not). I became very jaded and so did my brother and mother. We helped for 2 years and then after my aunt did that. Someone else could help.", "created_utc": 1676555143, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/113qz3j/update_aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_in_my_19f/", "score": 91, "replies": ["This is an unfortunate situation. But I think you should\u2019ve been honest. You are a wreck and he isn\u2019t even there yet. Plus there\u2019s no guarantee Mara will come back for him, that she\u2019ll send money for watching him, or that you won\u2019t be responsible for him when home. You should tell your mom you aren\u2019t ok with the arrangement or make plans to move out for your own peace of mind. I hope you all are able to figure something out.", "If you're this on edge because you're taking him in I think you made the wrong decision. You need to put yourself first more.", "Frankly I feel you're putting an awful lot of this on yourself. Don't want to watch him while he's there? Then don't. \nTo me it sounds like a lot of your apprehension to let this kid come for a bit is your resentment towards Mara.", "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11194rc/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_in_my_19f_cousin_4m/)", "Damn. This is a sad update. That poor kid, no one is standing up to call CPS, who could really help him find a better home long term. Hopefully eventually strangers/teachers step in and call CPS, this cannot continue.", "Eew. \nThat poor kid. \nWhy is no one calling protective services? He needs REAL help. Help he should have gotten from day one rather than being raised by a teenager. Your whole family has failed that kid and is continuing to the longer you allow all of this to happen. \nIf his mom is as bad as you said he could have maybe been adopted as an infant and have a lovely life instead of being seen as an unruly burden...", "You're a wreck because you know you're making the wrong decision, but it's easier to keep lying to yourself.", "The original post + this are way above reddit's paygrade", "I hope you will build a great relationship with your cousin and lead him to be a better person than his mother.", "I am happy to read this update. Your cousin is a little kid and need your mom more than you (you are 19) even if it is hard to share you are doing it right your situation is bad but if you abandoned this little guy your karma will be horrible. He is probably unstable because he doesn\u2019t have a stable family and I hope he will fit in yours when he understand he is wanted. Don\u2019t be jalous of Mara her life sounds horrible and has a tox mom this is normal as a minor she was fed by your family.", "I don't want anything bad to happen. I didn't even think about that until I read comments and now I cannot sleep well knowing me saying no means something might happen. All I'm doing is having stress vomit I can take it.", "You did not get pregnant at 14.  You should not be responsible for raising a 4 year old.  You're not a mom, and you're not his Mom.  I hope you can move out soon, with relatives or roommates.", "I feel bad because what if he thinks I hate him or when he's older he believes I resented him? I don't like any children so I act odd to him at times. But I couldn't sleep thinking he might be told I hated him and didn't want him in a happy home. And you are correct I feel like Mara always was loved/cared for more than me and this is just another example of it.", "I canr and won't. I'm sorry but my ex already told me enough cps horror stories to make my terrified. If I do that then everyone will hate me. I'm sorry but I just refuse to.", "From the sounds of it, nothing bad will happen. Your cousin is just doesn\u2019t want to be bothered. Not saying she isn\u2019t stressed with a new baby, and not saying she doesn\u2019t need a break. But she happily took everyone\u2019s money and used it for partying instead of raising her brother which is why he behaves so badly. It\u2019s hard to get someone to watch an unruly 4 year old and a baby so she can go out and party. Stress vomit leads to a lot of health complications, and mental stressors lead to even more health complications. I think it\u2019s important to be honest with your mom. If you can\u2019t, you need a contingency plan to get out of the situation. Based on how you describe your treatment compared to your cousin, you are more than likely going to care for this child. Then people will be mad at you for wanting to focus on yourself and studies. And the moment you say \u201cI never wanted him here\u201d they\u2019ll be mad at you for \u201cchanging\u201d your mind. This will only get worse from here and you will feel worse later also.", "Do you genuinely think this child doesn't already feel resented and unloved? That's a bold assumption coming from the person who called a 4 year old unruly. Like I said, your resentment towards Mara is rubbing off on this child. No one is FORCING YOU to take care of him. Your mother is choosing to take care of him, a choice she made. You don't have to like kids, but its not hard to not be mean to them either. Maybe let this kid feel like somebody loves him.", "You seem to think him coming is *just* to help Mara. Sounds like your mom also wants to *help* him to. But you're to clouded to see that because you hate his sister.", "I don't understand how I'm supposed to show more love. I do love him, i love him alot. I don't know how to show him more, I don't know him. I have seen him a handful of times his entire life. And Mara isn't hated. I just cannot be lovely dovey with someone who bullied me and then everyone loved her more. Family members would call me her name all the time, feed me food she liked, give me her clothes to wear and I can't just play nice now that she's nicer. Living being told that you're second best is hard.", "Like I said, your resentment towards his sister is clouding your vision.\nYou don't have to show him more love, because you're not capable of it (I don't mean that in a mean way just in a you're doing what you can do way) but you could try to show it a little more by idk maybe letting him feel maybe a shred of being welcome? Maybe letting him feel....wanted? Just a thought. \nAlso, Mara is an adult, granted not a very responsible one, but even you said she's nicer now. And you can't keep punishing other people for what others do. \nYou're mad at Mara because you felt she was favored, you're mad her brother is coming because again you feel Mara is favored. \nI'm the least favorite in my family, I know the frustration, but I also know that being a dick to a kid because I don't like his sister is a dick thing to do.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine to keep refusing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Multiple family members \" ... They are ALL not taking her in. So do not let them guilt you into doing what they don't want to do themselves.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are NOT an AH for wanting to have your own life.", ">I know I'm a bad cousin\n\nYour thinking is so fucking warped... so I'm gonna say it. You are not a bad a cousin.", "Donyou even read what you're typing? You're blaming your then teenaged cousin for using money meant to help raise her brother on babysitting, aka helping raise her brother. What would make you happy, seeing her suffer? There's a lot, lot of bitterness and blame throwing on your cousin, who, at least in this situation, is a victim. Also, throwing money at her isn't near enough to raising a child, which is what she's been doing since 16 and your family known at least since she's 17 and you've all been all too happy to let this happen. This is madness.", "Try r/JUSTNOFAMILY for help.  People there will understand the situation better.", "Thank you goodness", "I'm not blaming her. Mara is yes, nicer, but she has manipulative and cruel behaviors. She locked me in a dark space for half a hour and only had the girls with her let me out because my aunt heard my side screaming that i could not breathe. She proceeded to push me back in when my aunt left. When asked about this year's later she laughed it off. I have plenty that could ruin her reputation, but I do not want her to suffer or be in pain. I just do not feel much for her and I can only extend limited emotion towards her.", "So your best option is to neglect the kid, blame your cousin Mara for balancing work, a child, a younger brother, and being a normal 20 yo who is trying to socialize? You, your mother, your cousin NEED to do what is best for the kid and call CPS.", "Would it be possible to just refuse to provide his care and leave the burden to your mother where it should be? You didn't have a kid at 14. You are busy trying to make a life for yourself. If this is your mother's house and your mother is financially supporting you and this child, I don't understand what the issue is. This child is not Mara. He should be given a chance at a decent life whether his mother provides that for him or not. I don't see where your family expects you to care for him, but a firm \"no absolutely not!\" Might fix the problem. Don't provide his care. Do your own thing. He is a victim just like it sounds like you were a victim. Maybe he'll turn out to be a little friend you can relate to that way.", "You are not a bad person for needing to do what is right for you.\n\nThere are a lot of cruel people on the internet that will try and gang you into doing this or that, and AITA is not exactly known for the politeness of it's advice.\n\nI understand your concerns, but at the end of the day you need to do what's best by you. You cannot fill another's cup when your own well runs dry, and there's no benefit to cutting off parts of yourself to feed the hungry; you are simply using yourself up like fuel for a furnace that way.\n\nThis is a shit situation that likely feels like there is no good outcome possible, so in finding the least terrible option - favor yourself. You're 19 years old dude. You are barely not a child yourself. You would need to give more than you have, and what would be left for you?", "you\u2019re not a bad person", "You should of spoke up! Where are all the real adults In This situation????? To put this on you is ridiculous to put it on your cousin was ridiculous.", "NTA, your 19! You shouldn't be punished for someone else's lack of preparation. That is not your child, you are valid in the emotions you are feeling. I feel for your mother as well, this can't be easy.", "Read what you wrote again and tell us the nice things that balance out her neglect and abuse of you throughout your own development.\n\nYou -should- blame her - who's choice was it to take those actions if not hers? We are none of us puppets - there are no strings or people behind the curtain.", "You are putting the two things together when they are two separate people.  Helping the child is for the child's sake.  Getting him away from Mara is for the child's sake.  This really isn't about Mara, except where you make it to be.  It is about helping an innocent child.  Quit confusing the two.  The child did not do anything to you, did not bully you.  FYI - all adults call kids the wrong names. Maybe they thought you liked the same stuff.  You really are expecting too much out of adults.  We forget.  We get confused between kids.  We get confused as to who likes/dislikes whatever.  It isn't intentional.", "You are right, I am its just I cannot separate the two honestly. In my eyes Mara will always be linked to him and a huge chunk of his life. So I'm struggling.  \n\nAnd they did do it on purpose, they only stopped when my mother overheard and threatened no contact."]}
