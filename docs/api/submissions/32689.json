He divorced his ex when Edith was 7, but she apparently had a hard time with the split, and moving houses, etc. He and I met and married when Edith was 10. Together, we now have \"Cecilee\" (15F) and \"Peter\" (10M). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdith has always been aloof with our children. She was never particularly interested in them, although both kids, Cecilee especially, would've loved a closer relationship with her. I did bring up to my husband a few times that I was worried about Edith not being closer to her siblings. He responded that her ambivalence was better than he expected, given how hard she took the divorce, and he did not want to rock the boat. I was not happy with this but I let it rest. He and Edith are pretty close, but she barely speaks to me, Cecilee or Peter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCecilee has mostly gotten over her desire to be close to Edith. I used to see her perk up when she saw her at family functions a few years ago, making a point to sit close to her, or talk to her. She does not do that anymore, and is polite but not super eager when we see Edith now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to the current situation- Cecilee recently discovered a tik tok account of Edith's cousin. Apparently Edith has her sleepover in her condo (she lives in a big, \"fun\" city), and they go to events. They seem to be very close. This opened up a whole lot of feelings for Cecilee and she got upset and responded to the video saying \"That's my sister. And she barely talks to me\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiterally, that's all she said. But she got quite a response with people giving opinions for both sides. Apparently, someone figured out Edith's instagram, and were sending her harassing messages. I definitely feel awful about that. However, I refused to reprimand or punish my daughter. She only said the truth. My husband is upset as Edith skipped thanksgiving at our place this year, and he thinks punishing Cecilee will help his and Edith's relationship.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702149612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ekubb/aita_for_not_reprimanding_my_daughter_for_a_video/", "score": 2318, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cecilee made a mistake, and while she didn't intend for all this fallout, she DID try to shame Edith for not being closer to her on a post that had nothing to do with her. \n\nBut the real assholes here are you and your husband, for being so consumed in what *you* want for your children that you've neglected the reality of your family. You've both allowed your children to become less than they could be, because you centered your hurts and fears and resentments. Your husband wants to punish Cecilee not for her actions, but as a performance to placate Edith. You refuse to punish Cecilee, even though her actions hurt someone else, because you resent the person she hurt. I bet your husband was so afraid of Edith's pain and anger over the divorce that he refused to even engage with it, hence her not processing all those feelings before he remarried or had more kids. I also bet that while you \"let it rest,\" you still carried resentment towards your then-teenage stepdaughter for not playing happy family with you. The reality of Edith and Cecilee's behavior and emotions was an inconvenience, when it should have been your first concern.\n\nYou have all wronged each other. You have all failed each other. But you're also all family. That doesn't mean you have to see or like or even love each other, but if you *do*, it means you have something to fight for together.

However, the only reason she made that post was because she was jealous and wanted to publicly shame Edith. The whole point of the post was for people to see it and harass Edith for her choices.\n\nThe harsh reality is that Edith does not see your children as her siblings. Yes, they are technically biologically related, but it doesn\u2019t sound like Edith ever played the role of a sister to her siblings. This isn\u2019t even someone going no contact with a loved one.  There was never love there. \n\nYou and your husband can (and should) unpack his part in that but at the end of the day all you can ask from Edith is basic respect. Since you give no examples of her acting unkindly I am assuming she reached that benchmark.\n\nYou are judging Edith for not wanting what you want. In turn, your expectations have affected how Cecilee views the situation. I imagine part of her hurt stems from you enforcing the idea that she should still feel a connection to her siblings. \n\nA fifteen year old has a general idea of online harassment. Your daughter understood her words would cause problems for Edith even if she didn\u2019t understand the consequences.\n\nYour daughter needs to understand that fairly or unfairly what she did could cause drastic consequences to Edith. Online shaming doesn\u2019t stop just because someone wants it to stop, and it doesn\u2019t stay within expected or hoped for perimeters. If your daughter continues to use this method of speaking her truth she will continue to place herself in toxic and potentially dangerous situations online.\n\nGive Cecilee consequences for *that*, not because your husband wants her punished to mend his relationship with Edith, and then work out your issues with your husband. There\u2019s clearly something deep feelings there when it comes to the kids that will only keep bubbling to the surface if you never address it.", "*he thinks punishing Cecilee will help his and Edith's relationship*\n\nWTF?!\n\nHere's the thing: Edith doesn't have to like any of you. She can hang out with whomever she chooses.

If anyone is the ah its probably your husband. \n\nIm the eldest child and the only one that came from my mother and father. My siblings all came from my mom and dad\u2019s respective second marriages. I consider my siblings every but as much my sisters and brothers as any \u201cfull blooded\u201d sibling but I don\u2019t really have a relationship with the siblings from my fathers second marriage because my father was not present enough to foster that. I\u2019m extremely close to my mothers second child but it took until she was an age where our maturity matched up for that to happen (when I was about 25 and she was about 15 it only STARTED getting better. At 17 ish we were finally friends) \n\nFor people saying that cecilly lied, I dont think thats true. Sharing one parent imo is enough to make you just regular sisters. I have never met anyone who calls their half siblings \u201cmy half-siblings\u201d because they role they fill in your life is often very similar depending on how you live. \n\nI WILL say that my father\u2019s kids often felt like replacement family. But thats not because of my step mother or my siblings. Its because my father didn\u2019t give a shit about me the whole year except for the 4-6 weeks I spent with him in the summer. My FATHER is the one who made that relationship contentious, not my little sisters/brother. \n\nYou went to the dad.

To me it sounds like you\u2019re doing your best and that your daughter is hurt.

It may be valuable to have a talk with cecillee about the appropriate way to tell edith her feelings though, because it was a bit passive aggressive to do things the way that she did them.

She wanted no part of you or her half siblings. I suspect you knew that even before you had Cecilee because it sounds like you were never received warmly either. But when you saw Edith's indifference and Cecilee's initial excitement, you should have been tempering that. You should never have been fostering the sister idea at all. You knew Edith's attitudes to that point. Her father's new wife having a baby was not going to change her feelings. You let this go on for 15 years and let Cecilee fester this resentment for a fantasy that was all in her head and that Edith was under no obligation to feed. You know what, I'm changing my vote here. YTA because none of this is on Edith. It's on you and Cecilee, but mostly you because you didn't temper her fantasy to reality. You should have seen this coming a mile away.", "Actually curious here if someone can give me insight. I've seen a few posts bashing Edith.

Your daughter isn't behind any of the online bullying, but I think it's important to make this a learning experience about how dangerous the internet can be, and it would be nice if your daughter at least acknowledged that this was not the outcome she expected and that she has empathy for what's happening to Edith right now. As far as your involvement, I'll say soft YTA.", "YTA. Two wrongs don't make a right. Edith has clearly hurt Cecilee's feelings many times over the years. The best time to address that was in the moment, but it still deserves to be discussed. It's 100% valid for Cecilee to say \"my feelings are hurt\" including in public. But that's not what she did. If Edith is sorry for hurting Cecilee's feelings, she might consider saying so. An apology from Edith to Cecilee might help, if it's sincere.\n\nCecilee's online comment, whether she intended it to or not, is causing Edith to be harassed by strangers.  Given those circumstances, family members who care about one another would likely delete their comment and have a private discussion instead. It sounds like Cecilee hasn't done that.\n\nYour husband, as father to both of them, has an obligation to demonstrate love and concern for both. it doesn't sound like he's done that.\n\nSo you have a whole lot of people not actually talking to one another and not making the situation any better, either.\n\nAs a fifteen year-old, Cecilee should not be punished for expressing herself. But she should be expected to deal with consequences for the fact that her truthful comment is causing harm to Edith. And she should be taught to express her feelings using \"I words.\" I'm upset... My feelings are hurt... Accusations like \"she barely talks to me,\" \"she always...,\" or \"she never...\" are not helpful.\n\nYou, meanwhile, need to act more like a mother and less like an upset teenager.

Sometimes people are just closer and bond easier with certain people; I personally have a closer, sister like bond with one of my cousins than with my own sister, even though the age gap between me and my cousin is the bigger one. Its just how it worked out.

Regardless of you & daughter desiring a closer relationship, she didn't.  She didn't mistreat you or the kids.  She was ambivalent.

You could have had a conversation about the fact that Edith may not want a relationship with her.  Yes, it's a hard convo to have, but Cecilee would have stopped expecting Edith to come around and moved on.  I don't believe a punishment or reprimand is necessary, but it's probably time to have that talk.\n\nAlso, if your husband is worried about his relationship with Edith, Cecilee should never be used as a tool to ameliorate that, so honestly both you and your husband are TA.

I understand that you want to be closer to your stepdaughter, but trying to force a relationship just because it's something you want will only breed resentment, which it seems like you're now harboring for her when she didn't respond how you wanted. She doesn't owe you a relationship just because you married her dad.  In what ways was she made to feel more included or comfortable in the new family dynamic? Her dad said she took the separation really hard, so of course she was going to feel othered and isolated when her dad starts building a new family. When you and her dad realized you wanted to be a family you should have talked to her and made sure she knew she wasn't getting pushed out or replaced. You can't just blame the situation on her and let your daughter take out her frustration on Edith, by not addressing your daughter's passive aggressive behavior you're basically telling Edith that she is the problem and taking accountability for the situation away from everyone else. If your daughter wants a relationship with her sister, being passive aggressive isn't the way to do it. You both should apologize, and have an open and honest discussion and try to look at your family from her perspective.

Your stepdaughter just posted something, your daughter saw that and probably it triggered her feelings of half sister being absent in her life. That's all understandable. The important question is: should she publicly call out her half sister for not having much contact?\n\nThe sheer result of this should be enough answer. A whole lot of discussion came out of it with people that for the most part probably don't have anything to do with this. In other words: no, this is not the right place because you will involve people that shouldn't be involved.\n\nIf your daughter had issues with her half sisters post, she could have DM't her, or contacted her some other way. Either way: this is something between them and not a whole bunch of strangers, also putting both half sisters in awkward positions.\n\nAlso: the reason for the bad relationship can be various, but I think in this sense it doesn't really matter. You discuss sensitive things like this in private. Your step daughter might have understandable reason (your husband seems to hint at that), that doesn't necessarily mean your daughters disappointment about it isn't justified either. Mind also that there's a large age gap, I know of a situation where this worked really well, but in other situations it could just as well not work.\n\nA bit more mutual understanding and discussing this in private would help a lot. If things are mendable, which I do hope for all of you.\n\nAs for your question: yes, with all the backlash you should have at least have a talk with a 15y adolescent, reprimand might be a bit too strong though.

She's 27 and perfectly entitled to do whatever she chooses, with whomever she chooses. You need to teach Cecilee that actions can have unintended consequences, especially on the internet where people are emboldened by the fact that they don't have to actually face the people they choose to attack.

She was presumably  happy with the family she had and she didn\u2019t need a new mother. So I don\u2019t blame her for being stand offish. You also have to remember that she was what, 12 when her sister was born? Was the sister 6 when she went to college? That\u2019s an assumption of course. But 6 year olds hero worship and 18 year olds don\u2019t even think about 6 year olds. To her those are dad\u2019s new kids with his new wife, not really her family. And that\u2019s okay.

And it sounds like she gives you both that respect. \n\nBut Cecilee acted like an entitled stalking little pest, acted out publicly out of jealousy, and got Edith harassed, and drove a further wedge between them.

Cecilee's comments imply that she and Edith are similar in age and grew up in the same happy family together. That's simply not true. \n\nIt's unfortunate that Edith and Cecilee don't have a better relationship, but I can also see how a child who is 12 years older than Cecilee and dealing with difficult feelings about the situation isn't very close. It's not uncommon for 100% biological siblings with a 12-year age gap to have distance - they're in such different places for so long into the younger child's life. \n\nIt's probably a done deal now, but I think if you, Cecilee, and Peter hadn't tried to push a relationship for so long and just respected Edith's desire for space, you all might have ended up closer in the long run.

A close friend has a brother who is 15 years older, and they aren't close at all....", "She watched her parents divorce, her father remarry, move homes, have 2 new children with a new mother. Any reasonable response is that bio children feel replaced. That's a fact in nearly any situation.", "What do you call it when you refuse to get to know your siblings & continue to mostly ignore them after becoming an adult lol", "Show me where in the rules of this website it says that AH behavior doesn't count as AH behavior unless it's done more than once.", "extending grace to edith for once being a child with big feelings but then not extending that same grace to cecilee who is currently a child with big feelings is very unfair frankly. i think both daughters\u2019 feelings are very valid to have but to call one a brat is not cool imo.", "so Edith was a child once and that justifies her behavior at 27, but Cecilee is a child *now* and she's just a complete brat for saying it makes her sad that her sister doesn't care about her? because *other people* decided to respond by making that a witch-hunt?\n\nEdith doesn't have to care about her. but Cecilee is 15 and still figuring out how to address her feelings maturely. she is equally entitled to feel hurt by Edith's spurning as Edith is entitled to feel hurt by her parents' divorce. Edith didn't bring her sister into this world, and her sister didn't bring herself into this world either. this double standard is bizarre to me. either both of their reactions to this rift are understandable, or neither of them are, and they're both being brats - except one is a teenager and the other is old enough to sign on a mortgage. personally i just think they both suffered from a poorly-meshed family, and neither of them are at fault for how messy it turned out.", "I think it wasn\u2019t necessarily foreseeable that her comment on TikTok would lead to a stranger harassing her sister on Instagram. \n\nThat said the fact that it was a factual statement doesn\u2019t mean that the 15 shouldn\u2019t apologise for the unintentional consequences.", "It happens every day without these feelings. I have so many friends with half siblings they adore", "So it may be correct to say Edith FELT replaced, not that she WAS replaced. Big difference. The latter makes it sound like OP and her husband have been shoving Edith aside for years and we have no proof of that.", "Setting a boundary that her family is her bio-mother and bio-father. She can choose not to engage with her new family, that is called a boundary."]}
