He divorced his ex when Edith was 7, but she apparently had a hard time with the split, and moving houses, etc. He and I met and married when Edith was 10. Together, we now have \"Cecilee\" (15F) and \"Peter\" (10M). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdith has always been aloof with our children. She was never particularly interested in them, although both kids, Cecilee especially, would've loved a closer relationship with her. I did bring up to my husband a few times that I was worried about Edith not being closer to her siblings. He responded that her ambivalence was better than he expected, given how hard she took the divorce, and he did not want to rock the boat. I was not happy with this but I let it rest. He and Edith are pretty close, but she barely speaks to me, Cecilee or Peter.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCecilee has mostly gotten over her desire to be close to Edith. I used to see her perk up when she saw her at family functions a few years ago, making a point to sit close to her, or talk to her. She does not do that anymore, and is polite but not super eager when we see Edith now.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo to the current situation- Cecilee recently discovered a tik tok account of Edith's cousin. Apparently Edith has her sleepover in her condo (she lives in a big, \"fun\" city), and they go to events. They seem to be very close. This opened up a whole lot of feelings for Cecilee and she got upset and responded to the video saying \"That's my sister. And she barely talks to me\". \n\n&#x200B;\n\nLiterally, that's all she said. But she got quite a response with people giving opinions for both sides. Apparently, someone figured out Edith's instagram, and were sending her harassing messages. I definitely feel awful about that. However, I refused to reprimand or punish my daughter. She only said the truth. My husband is upset as Edith skipped thanksgiving at our place this year, and he thinks punishing Cecilee will help his and Edith's relationship.\n\nSo AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1702149612, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ekubb/aita_for_not_reprimanding_my_daughter_for_a_video/", "score": 3706, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cecilee made a mistake, and while she didn't intend for all this fallout, she DID try to shame Edith for not being closer to her on a post that had nothing to do with her. \n\nBut the real assholes here are you and your husband, for being so consumed in what *you* want for your children that you've neglected the reality of your family. You've both allowed your children to become less than they could be, because you centered your hurts and fears and resentments. Your husband wants to punish Cecilee not for her actions, but as a performance to placate Edith. You refuse to punish Cecilee, even though her actions hurt someone else, because you resent the person she hurt. I bet your husband was so afraid of Edith's pain and anger over the divorce that he refused to even engage with it, hence her not processing all those feelings before he remarried or had more kids. I also bet that while you \"let it rest,\" you still carried resentment towards your then-teenage stepdaughter for not playing happy family with you. The reality of Edith and Cecilee's behavior and emotions was an inconvenience, when it should have been your first concern.\n\nYou have all wronged each other. You have all failed each other. But you're also all family. That doesn't mean you have to see or like or even love each other, but if you *do*, it means you have something to fight for together.

However, the only reason she made that post was because she was jealous and wanted to publicly shame Edith. The whole point of the post was for people to see it and harass Edith for her choices.\n\nThe harsh reality is that Edith does not see your children as her siblings. Yes, they are technically biologically related, but it doesn\u2019t sound like Edith ever played the role of a sister to her siblings. This isn\u2019t even someone going no contact with a loved one.  There was never love there. \n\nYou and your husband can (and should) unpack his part in that but at the end of the day all you can ask from Edith is basic respect. Since you give no examples of her acting unkindly I am assuming she reached that benchmark.\n\nYou are judging Edith for not wanting what you want. In turn, your expectations have affected how Cecilee views the situation. I imagine part of her hurt stems from you enforcing the idea that she should still feel a connection to her siblings. \n\nA fifteen year old has a general idea of online harassment. Your daughter understood her words would cause problems for Edith even if she didn\u2019t understand the consequences.\n\nYour daughter needs to understand that fairly or unfairly what she did could cause drastic consequences to Edith. Online shaming doesn\u2019t stop just because someone wants it to stop, and it doesn\u2019t stay within expected or hoped for perimeters. If your daughter continues to use this method of speaking her truth she will continue to place herself in toxic and potentially dangerous situations online.\n\nGive Cecilee consequences for *that*, not because your husband wants her punished to mend his relationship with Edith, and then work out your issues with your husband. There\u2019s clearly something deep feelings there when it comes to the kids that will only keep bubbling to the surface if you never address it.", "*he thinks punishing Cecilee will help his and Edith's relationship*\n\nWTF?!\n\nHere's the thing: Edith doesn't have to like any of you. She can hang out with whomever she chooses.

If anyone is the ah its probably your husband. \n\nIm the eldest child and the only one that came from my mother and father. My siblings all came from my mom and dad\u2019s respective second marriages. I consider my siblings every but as much my sisters and brothers as any \u201cfull blooded\u201d sibling but I don\u2019t really have a relationship with the siblings from my fathers second marriage because my father was not present enough to foster that. I\u2019m extremely close to my mothers second child but it took until she was an age where our maturity matched up for that to happen (when I was about 25 and she was about 15 it only STARTED getting better. At 17 ish we were finally friends) \n\nFor people saying that cecilly lied, I dont think thats true. Sharing one parent imo is enough to make you just regular sisters. I have never met anyone who calls their half siblings \u201cmy half-siblings\u201d because they role they fill in your life is often very similar depending on how you live. \n\nI WILL say that my father\u2019s kids often felt like replacement family. But thats not because of my step mother or my siblings. Its because my father didn\u2019t give a shit about me the whole year except for the 4-6 weeks I spent with him in the summer. My FATHER is the one who made that relationship contentious, not my little sisters/brother. \n\nYou went to the dad.

To me it sounds like you\u2019re doing your best and that your daughter is hurt.

It may be valuable to have a talk with cecillee about the appropriate way to tell edith her feelings though, because it was a bit passive aggressive to do things the way that she did them.

She wanted no part of you or her half siblings. I suspect you knew that even before you had Cecilee because it sounds like you were never received warmly either. But when you saw Edith's indifference and Cecilee's initial excitement, you should have been tempering that. You should never have been fostering the sister idea at all. You knew Edith's attitudes to that point. Her father's new wife having a baby was not going to change her feelings. You let this go on for 15 years and let Cecilee fester this resentment for a fantasy that was all in her head and that Edith was under no obligation to feed. You know what, I'm changing my vote here. YTA because none of this is on Edith. It's on you and Cecilee, but mostly you because you didn't temper her fantasy to reality. You should have seen this coming a mile away.", "Actually curious here if someone can give me insight. I've seen a few posts bashing Edith.

Your daughter isn't behind any of the online bullying, but I think it's important to make this a learning experience about how dangerous the internet can be, and it would be nice if your daughter at least acknowledged that this was not the outcome she expected and that she has empathy for what's happening to Edith right now. As far as your involvement, I'll say soft YTA.", "YTA. Two wrongs don't make a right. Edith has clearly hurt Cecilee's feelings many times over the years. The best time to address that was in the moment, but it still deserves to be discussed. It's 100% valid for Cecilee to say \"my feelings are hurt\" including in public. But that's not what she did. If Edith is sorry for hurting Cecilee's feelings, she might consider saying so. An apology from Edith to Cecilee might help, if it's sincere.\n\nCecilee's online comment, whether she intended it to or not, is causing Edith to be harassed by strangers.  Given those circumstances, family members who care about one another would likely delete their comment and have a private discussion instead. It sounds like Cecilee hasn't done that.\n\nYour husband, as father to both of them, has an obligation to demonstrate love and concern for both. it doesn't sound like he's done that.\n\nSo you have a whole lot of people not actually talking to one another and not making the situation any better, either.\n\nAs a fifteen year-old, Cecilee should not be punished for expressing herself. But she should be expected to deal with consequences for the fact that her truthful comment is causing harm to Edith. And she should be taught to express her feelings using \"I words.\" I'm upset... My feelings are hurt... Accusations like \"she barely talks to me,\" \"she always...,\" or \"she never...\" are not helpful.\n\nYou, meanwhile, need to act more like a mother and less like an upset teenager.

Sometimes people are just closer and bond easier with certain people; I personally have a closer, sister like bond with one of my cousins than with my own sister, even though the age gap between me and my cousin is the bigger one. Its just how it worked out.

Regardless of you & daughter desiring a closer relationship, she didn't.  She didn't mistreat you or the kids.  She was ambivalent.

You could have had a conversation about the fact that Edith may not want a relationship with her.  Yes, it's a hard convo to have, but Cecilee would have stopped expecting Edith to come around and moved on.  I don't believe a punishment or reprimand is necessary, but it's probably time to have that talk.\n\nAlso, if your husband is worried about his relationship with Edith, Cecilee should never be used as a tool to ameliorate that, so honestly both you and your husband are TA.

I understand that you want to be closer to your stepdaughter, but trying to force a relationship just because it's something you want will only breed resentment, which it seems like you're now harboring for her when she didn't respond how you wanted. She doesn't owe you a relationship just because you married her dad.  In what ways was she made to feel more included or comfortable in the new family dynamic? Her dad said she took the separation really hard, so of course she was going to feel othered and isolated when her dad starts building a new family. When you and her dad realized you wanted to be a family you should have talked to her and made sure she knew she wasn't getting pushed out or replaced. You can't just blame the situation on her and let your daughter take out her frustration on Edith, by not addressing your daughter's passive aggressive behavior you're basically telling Edith that she is the problem and taking accountability for the situation away from everyone else. If your daughter wants a relationship with her sister, being passive aggressive isn't the way to do it. You both should apologize, and have an open and honest discussion and try to look at your family from her perspective.

Your stepdaughter just posted something, your daughter saw that and probably it triggered her feelings of half sister being absent in her life. That's all understandable. The important question is: should she publicly call out her half sister for not having much contact?\n\nThe sheer result of this should be enough answer. A whole lot of discussion came out of it with people that for the most part probably don't have anything to do with this. In other words: no, this is not the right place because you will involve people that shouldn't be involved.\n\nIf your daughter had issues with her half sisters post, she could have DM't her, or contacted her some other way. Either way: this is something between them and not a whole bunch of strangers, also putting both half sisters in awkward positions.\n\nAlso: the reason for the bad relationship can be various, but I think in this sense it doesn't really matter. You discuss sensitive things like this in private. Your step daughter might have understandable reason (your husband seems to hint at that), that doesn't necessarily mean your daughters disappointment about it isn't justified either. Mind also that there's a large age gap, I know of a situation where this worked really well, but in other situations it could just as well not work.\n\nA bit more mutual understanding and discussing this in private would help a lot. If things are mendable, which I do hope for all of you.\n\nAs for your question: yes, with all the backlash you should have at least have a talk with a 15y adolescent, reprimand might be a bit too strong though.

She's 27 and perfectly entitled to do whatever she chooses, with whomever she chooses. You need to teach Cecilee that actions can have unintended consequences, especially on the internet where people are emboldened by the fact that they don't have to actually face the people they choose to attack.

She was presumably  happy with the family she had and she didn\u2019t need a new mother. So I don\u2019t blame her for being stand offish. You also have to remember that she was what, 12 when her sister was born? Was the sister 6 when she went to college? That\u2019s an assumption of course. But 6 year olds hero worship and 18 year olds don\u2019t even think about 6 year olds. To her those are dad\u2019s new kids with his new wife, not really her family. And that\u2019s okay.

And it sounds like she gives you both that respect. \n\nBut Cecilee acted like an entitled stalking little pest, acted out publicly out of jealousy, and got Edith harassed, and drove a further wedge between them.

Cecilee's comments imply that she and Edith are similar in age and grew up in the same happy family together. That's simply not true. \n\nIt's unfortunate that Edith and Cecilee don't have a better relationship, but I can also see how a child who is 12 years older than Cecilee and dealing with difficult feelings about the situation isn't very close. It's not uncommon for 100% biological siblings with a 12-year age gap to have distance - they're in such different places for so long into the younger child's life. \n\nIt's probably a done deal now, but I think if you, Cecilee, and Peter hadn't tried to push a relationship for so long and just respected Edith's desire for space, you all might have ended up closer in the long run.

When you introduce cats, to well anything new, a new pet, a new house, it's important to go slowly, cats ate both predator and prey animals and are natural skittish,they need to feel safe and have a safe space to retreat to, they got to go at their own pace and trying to make them go faster results in the complete opposite. If you dont respect their boundaries, that breaks any trust they could have with you and will scare them into never trusting you and making it impossible to form an actual bond with you.\nNow, you might be wondering  what does cats have to do with this situation. Well, I think that based on the way you explained the situation, Edith was a scared cat that you forcefully introduce to a new environment without respecting her boundaries and now she doesnt want to do anything with you and your child and it frustrates you because you consider you did everything right and you deserve a relationship and that your kids deserves a relationship with edith because they share dna. You have trouble accepting this reality and thus seek revenge. It's not healthy,  if she doesn't want a relationship it's her choice you have to accept and respect her lack of consent and trying to use your daughter into pressuring edith into a relationship isnt healthy.

You should take your daughter weaponizing a public platform like this very seriously, and Edith has done nothing wrong.\n\nAs someone who is very close to my older brother (8 years older) I was very lucky that he embraced my arrival and loved spending time with me when we were kids - but most of his peers hated spending time with me. Most of his peers with much younger siblings had no relationship with them. Our close relationship was the exception, not the norm. Of course as his little sister I admired and adored my \"cool\" (in retrospect, he was not) older brother, but I had very little to relate to him on and mostly took up a lot of his time and stopped him from doing a bunch of stuff he wanted to! Luckily, he liked me enough, he didn't care! And even so, I think he had less of an older brother relationship to me and more of a deputy parent relationship.\n\nAdding another 4 years to that dynamic would have made us more distant almost by obligation.

I don't blame Cecilee for desperately seeking love and approval from her big sister, or being hurt she didn't get it. That sucks, poor thing. The thing is, she wasn't owed it.

You have an excuse to build blanket forts, play video games, drink soda while watching cartoons, and attempting weird tricks on jungle gyms and have it not be weird.", "Idk man, it's on Tiktok as well and you know how the internet never truly erases anything. I think if one is committed enough they'll prolly be able to find this on Tiktok as well and link both together. \n\nAgree on your last paragraph, from what I'm seeing OP is not teaching her daughter anything good if this has been happening ever since she stepped into Edith's family. She didn't even bother to teach her brat how to navigate these unresolved feelings of resentment lol, which resulted into this shitfest today.", "Similar situation here, too. I have a brother I rarely speak to and he's only three years older than me...just because you're related doesn't mean you're meant to be super close. It happens.", "I was the youngest of five, the only girl, and the only one from my mothers second marriage. All of my brothers are half brothers. There is a minimum of 4 years between each of us, meaning that my oldest brother was basically an adult when I was born. We had no real relationship when I was growing up, but of all my brothers, my relationship with him is the best between all of my siblings now. It just took time for me to ALSO become an adult, and gradually begin to create a relationship with him - mostly online in private conversation, but we have visited each other. We live in different states, so it\u2019s a long distance relationship - but we talk regularly. \n\nJust because there\u2019s no real relationship when the younger is still a child doesn\u2019t mean there will never be a relationship. Having said which, a little understanding from both sides wouldn\u2019t hurt. This fiasco is likely to have caused more harm to a future relationship between them than their respective ages ever could. OP needs to let the younger child know of the consequences to her actions, and the father could at least acknowledge that the younger was hurt by what appeared to be a personal snub (which I seriously doubt it was) and let the older know how there were consequences to HER actions too.", "Absolutely. My sibling is 13 years younger than me and our parents pitted us against each other. I had no real interest in her anyway, was made to parentify  her and left home at 17 to go to college abroad. Never really looked back. I am very close to my cousins, though. My aunt really loved me and I believe that is why we are so close.", "This should be the top comment. An immature 15 year old on social media can cause far reaching consequences/", "Also, I didn't want to spend time with my sister that was *2 years* younger for a lot of my childhood. It's not unusual for a 12 year age gap between siblings to mean they aren't as close since they're not really growing up together, I'd think?", "There is a massive age gap though\u2026not many 27yr olds wanna hang out with 15yr olds", "Yeah, I have an older half sister with an age gap similar to the one here, and we are cordial with each other, but we're not close. Same with my other older half sister. There's a lot of family dynamic stuff that explains part of it, but also, when you have that large of an age gap with children, it's going to be difficult for any closeness to occur", "Her computer usage should absolutely be monitored by OP because she is completely immature.", "This is how online bullying started!", ">It\u2019s not her step siblings. They are her half siblings.\n\nNo difference for these purposes.", "Op seems to be emotionally immature  and greiving that her ideal was never tru wich is sad.", "Agree. One of my cousins is a whole 26 years older than me due to the age gap between my mom and her eldest brother (his dad). They're like a second family to us as they live super close, but I'm way closer to his kids as we were all born within 4 years of each other. My cousin himself feels more like an uncle to me tbh. \n\nIf you wouldn't expect people with a wide age gap to necessarily even gel as friends or coworkers I certainly wouldn't necessarily expect it between siblings.", "> OP not encouraging her to take the comment down and explaining to her why it was wrong to make the comment in the first place is setting her up for long term failure in multiple ways.\n\nOP is savoring the drama and confrontation. OP is clearly resentful of Edith, and is happy to see Edith publicly harassed and *'brought down a peg or two'* via her daughter's actions.\n\nYTA", "Wait a minute.  He doesn't want the sister punished for her feelings, he wants her punished for displaying them on the internet in a derogatory way.  \n\nEdith is an adult.  She chooses to not strengthen the relationship with her sister.    She shouldn't be harassed online by strangers for that.  She isn't messing with her sister online.", "Cecile wouldn't be being punished for her feelings, she'd be being punished for her actions. A 15 year old would know full well that the comment would invite bullying and that is exactly why should would have done it. Edith is just living her life", "Cecilee is not being punished for her feelings. She is being punished for making a passive-aggressive comment, which led to Edith getting harassed. \n\nThe dad is parenting correctly here. Edith doesn't want a close relationship with Cecilee. Cecilee's feelings are hurt, but the dad can't and won't force a relationship on his adult daughter. Cecilee lashed out and was on a public forum. That was inappropriate behavior and needs to be corrected. I blame OP more, as it sounds like she is the one pushing the idea of Edith being the big sister.", "I have a friend I consider a brother, who I have not one drop of blood in common with, I also have siblings and a father I haven't had any contact with in 3 years. I'm living my life and they're presumably living theirs. Just because we share some DNA doesn't mean they interest me as people. I don't see why being related to someone should entitle you to a relationship with them", ">They're half on the fathers side. That makes them her blood siblings and changes the family dynamic of this whole situation.\n\nWhy does this distinction matter?", "Yep she didn't get \"that happy family who goes out for picnics together every weekend!\" and decided to go all Evil Stepmother mode lol. \n\nShe even had the audacity to tell Edith that Edith will always have a place in this family when OP was the one who came into the family? Goodness me.", "A friend of mine has similar age gap between his sisters and him as Edith has to her siblings (the sisters left for college before he started school) and it wasnt until he was in his mid thirties that they really started to feel like siblings. \n\nThe divorce and \"replacement family\" aside, I think the age gap alone would be enough for Edith to not be interested in a closer relationship with her younger halfsiblings", "I mean, the opposite can be true. My older sister is my half sister, there is a 15 year age gap and she is my best friend. It's not a given that they shouldn't be close because of age or whatever", "I was 13 when my brother was born, turned 14 nine days later, and he is the sibling to whom I'm closest.\n\nI don't speak to the sister closest in age to myself.\n\nAge gaps affect everyone differently and I don't think they're the primary issue here.", "Itvdiesntvsound like he favors her but is protective if her. But why isn't HE reprimanding his own daughter?", "Dad wanting the older sister left alone instead of trying to work out some obviously deep seated issues may not have been the wisest of choices.  My siblings are all at least 10 years older than me, all half-siblings, and we have had respectful relationships.  It's possible, but Mom and Dad have to both be on the same page.", "I have siblings who are 10-15 years younger (parents divorced and remarried) and never bonded with them as kids because I was already pretty independent by that point. By the time they were grade school aged I left for college. We're all adults now and friendly but we definitely don't have the usual sibling relationship. Is it really that unreasonable that someone in their late twenties wouldn't want to hang out with a 15 year old they probably don't know that well? One whose mom obviously resents them?", "Truly sad, if she didn't self sabotage like that she might have actually ended with her happy ending.\n\nAlso I  deeply apologize for the amount of spelling mistakes I made during this exchange, I am very tired and English isnt my native language.", "Opposite can be true as well like others have said. We\u2019ve seen post already where people have a close relationship despite such a large gap. \n\nMy mom (oldest) and my youngest aunt are around 7-8 years apart and they were really close. I was close to my older siblings growing up and the of them are 9 and 13 years older than me.", "I think \u201cattack\u201d is abit of an exaggeration, Cecilee didn\u2019t try and assassinate her character, she said that Edith is her sister and barely speaks to her, all of this is true. And let\u2019s not forget that Edith is 27 and cecilee is a child, instead of not showing up to thanksgiving over a comment on a tiktok she posted why couldn\u2019t she call or text her sister and actually ask WHY she commented that and talk to her about her feelings? \n\nShe didn\u2019t do that showing she really couldn\u2019t give a shit less about her sister, which is her right but it\u2019s Cecilee\u2019s right to feel upset and alittle angry that her sister wants nothing to do with her over something out of her control, a divorce that happened 5 years before she was even born.", "Protective of one to the determinant of his other, no matter how you word it its wrong", "Exactly! Like, I have cousins who I like to hang out with--because even with the age difference, they're super cool and we have similar interests... but I'm not going to hang out with cousins or siblings or people who I have no interest in interacting with.", "The age difference doesn't prevent closeness. My mom was super close to her youngest sister, 16 years younger. My whole family adored her. It's an issue of living situations (together full time, part time, etc.) as well as personalities. Some siblings just click and others don't.", "Yeah, exactly. And that's if they're around and have personalities that mesh well.", "She can have her feelings, but she shouldn't be posting them online, with real names involved, for every rando to see. This is a personal matter, not something that needs to be broadcasted to the world. Doing that is just asking for problems.", "Maybe not an attack per se, but absolutely passive aggressive and designed to get a reaction supporting her. If she needs support she should be asking for and getting it from real people, not randos on the Internet.", "Address Edith\u2019s part? She\u2019s 27. At most if her dad brings it up with her she\u2019ll leave or just stop talking to them. Cecilee is being a typical teenager", "We see this a lot in Reddit posts, and in real life.  Step, half, or full siblings, younger children tend to want a relationship with older siblings, and the older siblings often see them as intrusive pests.  It is a very sad fact of life, and happened in my own family of full siblings.  Parents cannot manage their children's feelings besides trying to understand each.\n\nThe problem here is that Cecilee put her feelings on the Internet, and the trolls came out.  I don't know if she realized that one can hardly say \"my favorite color is blue\" without getting death threats.  \n\nI think that Cecilee needs to understand that, disappointed by her sister though she is, this kind of thing belongs in private, not on social media.  This is hardly going to improve her relationship with Edith.", "Cecilee shouldn't be punished but this is a perfect opportunity to learn that life isn't fair. She's hurt that her sister doesn't want a relationship with her and that's valid. But that's very much HER problem, and wanting to shame Edith publicly because she's close to her cousin is an inappropriate way to handle her feelings. \n\nI say that as someone who agrees with your general point that Edith needs to get over her parents' divorce. At 27 years old, yeah, she's being kind of ridiculous. But the damage is done and at this point she's not going to start feeling warmly towards siblings she's had zero relationships with. That's the current reality and everyone needs to get on board for their own sakes.", "The cousin is Edith\u2019s maternal cousin and it\u2019s been posted OP said 19, but I got nothing out of the main post that gives an indication she\u2019s a kid like the 15yo, opposite actually. And where is it clear OP had nothing to do with the divorce? Not saying she did but Iv seen nothing to indicate she didn\u2019t either.", ">all of this is true\n\nBut the time and place makes it an attack.", "If Edith wants nothing to do with her younger siblings, then that's her prerogative.  But younger siblings who have looked up to her and tried to reach out and have her be a part of their lives have every right to be hurt by this, and this is a consequence of that. Is it okay that Edith gets harassed?  No, of course not.  But that's not the poster's fault.", "But she didn\u2019t go onto someone else\u2019s SM. She posted it on hers. It\u2019s not her fault that someone else figured the IG out and sent those messages?? Jesus.", "I\u2019d settle for her just talking to them. OP says Edith barely talks to her or her half siblings. Yet apparently under normal circumstances, she\u2019ll come for a holiday dinner. I think it\u2019s super shitty of OP\u2019s husband to allow her to come into OP\u2019s home, sit down to a dinner that OP probably cooked, and barely acknowledge her or his other kids. Someone who behaved that way wouldn\u2019t be welcome in my home.", "The divorce happened when Edith was 7. OP met her husband when Edith was 10. It\u2019s in the first paragraph of her post."]}
