He said that she's busy getting some supplies and would be back soon.\n\nI said all right and the party continued. After some time my sister-in-law arrived and apologized for being late. She had a Nintendo switch with her, along with other stuff. She gave it to Cheyenne when the others were looking and said \"This is for my sweet little baby girl.\"\n\nWell, she knew that I could not afford to buy all that stuff (there were plenty of other games, and not just the Switch). I asked her what that was about, and she said she had to get it soon before the store closed before arriving. She had not bought anything for Jeremy, and while I did not have a problem with it, I considered it rude.\n\nCheyenne said thank you and was like \"Thank you. At least my parents are not as poor as my uncle and his family is. Jeremy probably has to deal with old clothes, but I don't\". I was shocked, and then Jeremy began to cry at that. I asked her to apologize and she said it was just a joke, and then told Jeremy that \"Yeah, you're such a cry-baby, so I'll say that I am sorry.\"\n\nWe got into an argument with my brother and he said it was just a joke, and I accused him and his wife of showing up to give the gift and insulting us, etc. I called him a scoundrel and he got mad at me and began to yell a lot.He said he has the right to give his daughter stuff and that Cheyenne already apologized and all that.
