NTA. \n\nI had a slightly similar experience. My mom used to tell this story about how I got hurt once and she dragged herself out of her sick bed (she had the flu) and took me to the hospital. And then once there collapsed and the nurse rushed to help her. The point of the story was to highlight what a great mom she was for me. \n\nAnd being a kid I just accepted it and nodded and smiled. Until one day when I was about 13-14, one of the people my mom was telling this story to asked the following question: \"Wait? She had cut her foot so badly blood was spurting? She was in shock and couldn't speak? What do you mean, you felt terrible but pulled yourself out of bed anyway. What alternative did you have, mymom'sname? Were you going to lie there because you were tired and watch your child bleed to death? Getting your bleeding child to a doctor is the least you could do. And if you collapsed at the hospital with a child who was bleeding, I doubt they all ran to you and how would you know if you passed out?\" \n\nAnd it was like a lightbulb went off in my head, as my mom sulked away. I had just accepted all these stories my whole life but *now* as I listened to them, I could finally pick out where my mom was gliding over the mistakes she made and focusing on how 'funny' it was that I made these mistakes as a child.\n\nThat's a narcissist thing your mom is doing. She's making sure that whatever happened, is never her fault. And if she has to blame and traumatize a small child to do it, so be it. She'll never see it that way. She's just remaking the world so she's the good one and other people are not real people just props in her story. Realizing that my mom didn't actually see me as a separate / real person from her was both a blessing (oh, none of this is actually my fault and I\"m not a bad person) and a curse (oh dip, my mother didn't give me the love a child needs and I've got issues from that - hello insecure attachment).\n\nYou did not disrespect your mom by pointing out the inconsistencies of her story. Except in her mind. You don't have to accept her world view. Being a gray rock with my mom and just being me without caring about her response (after some years of therapy to learn how) was the most freeing thing ever.\n\nDon't apologize. She'll suddenly start talking to you again when she needs or wants something and this little kerfluffle will have never happened. Keep telling yourself ... trash takes itself out. You lose nothing by having this space. And if you can, get a good therapist and learn that you deserve love and nothing you did is why you got someone who didn't love you the way you deserve.", "NTA and this is how nc landed in your lap, if thats what you want :)", "So she gets to endlessly shame you for something that truly wasn\u2019t your fault and wants an apology also?

He groomed them, took them to the shows, and dragged us along. He also bred them while we lived in a flat in a highrise block. He did not love the dogs enough to walk them regularly. Most of the time this was our job.  \nOne time he was trying to breed one of the dogs. For pedigree dogs this means paying an owner of a male substantial amount of money to bring his dog to the female, and hoping they mate and the female gets pregnant. Female dogs can have multiple intercourses during one period, and as a result puppies with more than one father in one litter. Walking a female which is on heat (in period) is super stressful, and was even more stressful then because there were a lot of stray dogs around. So one day I was walking my dog and a stray male jumped on her and started an intercourse. When dogs mate they got stuck together. It\u2019s physically impossible to separate them. This was super awful for me .I knew this was bad, but couldn\u2019t do anything about it. I told my dad after and he went ballistic. He raged for days, grounded me, and then stopped talking to everyone in the house for a while.   \nFor whatever reason he still decided to sell the puppies after they were born. Puppies are all born looking almost the same, no matter the breed they all look generic \u201cdog\u201d with black smooth hair. They\u2019re sold around eight weeks old before the breed characteristics start showing. So my dad took them to a dog show and sold there as pedigree. Some of them  were not. So he ruined his name as a breeder and because it\u2019s a small world he could not show himself in the shows any more after that. And the misery or forced participation in his pedigree dog breeding hobby ended for the whole family.  \nIf an adult gives their child responsibility for a task, and the task is above the child\u2019s age, and the adult does not make that kind of assessment, and does support the child, the responsibility for a failure is fully on the adult.

She decided to tell this at a dinner party until I pointed out that I still have the bookings for all her flights and even the texts about me checking them in and taking her to the airport and what actually happened was that she decided (before going) that the 4 star hotel I had booked and paid for was too cheap so she didn\u2019t want to stay at it for four nights, when I told her it was non refundable I sent her the short list I had gone through and she picked a different one and paid for it herself, it was actually \u00a320 cheaper and about half a mile away from the one I had chosen so I have no idea why but in her mind she knew better than me. Over the years (because I wouldn\u2019t pay up for a 2nd hotel after buying her and her husband the flight and tickets to this event and original hotel) she had got it into her head that I had just been so inconsiderate that I bought them tickets to something in a foreign country and left them to sort it out.
