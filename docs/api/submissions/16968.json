NTA. \n\nI had a slightly similar experience. My mom used to tell this story about how I got hurt once and she dragged herself out of her sick bed (she had the flu) and took me to the hospital. And then once there collapsed and the nurse rushed to help her. The point of the story was to highlight what a great mom she was for me. \n\nAnd being a kid I just accepted it and nodded and smiled. Until one day when I was about 13-14, one of the people my mom was telling this story to asked the following question: \"Wait? She had cut her foot so badly blood was spurting? She was in shock and couldn't speak? What do you mean, you felt terrible but pulled yourself out of bed anyway. What alternative did you have, mymom'sname? Were you going to lie there because you were tired and watch your child bleed to death? Getting your bleeding child to a doctor is the least you could do. And if you collapsed at the hospital with a child who was bleeding, I doubt they all ran to you and how would you know if you passed out?\" \n\nAnd it was like a lightbulb went off in my head, as my mom sulked away. I had just accepted all these stories my whole life but *now* as I listened to them, I could finally pick out where my mom was gliding over the mistakes she made and focusing on how 'funny' it was that I made these mistakes as a child.\n\nThat's a narcissist thing your mom is doing. She's making sure that whatever happened, is never her fault. And if she has to blame and traumatize a small child to do it, so be it. She'll never see it that way. She's just remaking the world so she's the good one and other people are not real people just props in her story. Realizing that my mom didn't actually see me as a separate / real person from her was both a blessing (oh, none of this is actually my fault and I\"m not a bad person) and a curse (oh dip, my mother didn't give me the love a child needs and I've got issues from that - hello insecure attachment).\n\nYou did not disrespect your mom by pointing out the inconsistencies of her story. Except in her mind. You don't have to accept her world view. Being a gray rock with my mom and just being me without caring about her response (after some years of therapy to learn how) was the most freeing thing ever.\n\nDon't apologize. She'll suddenly start talking to you again when she needs or wants something and this little kerfluffle will have never happened. Keep telling yourself ... trash takes itself out. You lose nothing by having this space. And if you can, get a good therapist and learn that you deserve love and nothing you did is why you got someone who didn't love you the way you deserve.", "NTA and this is how nc landed in your lap, if thats what you want :)", "So she gets to endlessly shame you for something that truly wasn\u2019t your fault and wants an apology also?

It is ok for you to set boundaries, i.e. \"please don't tell stories about me\" but I don't think she would listen.  You put her on notice that she can't do this in a way she can't ignore.  Don't apologize and don't back down.  She is both unreasonable and not a healthy parent.  I'm glad you got in touch with your anger and in the heat of the moment set a boundary.", "I skipped the pathetic part. But I'm failing to see how you're at fault, either. She has been lauding this over your head for years, bringing up painful memories to get a laugh for her and the crowd while shaming and putting you down. \n\nAnd she never told the true details of what happened because it would make her look like an ass. You did tell the truth. You don't owe an apology. She owes you one for that day and every time she used that story to put you down.", "That's just the truth. You said nothing that was factually incorrect. She is stupid for trusting a 6 year old with a 60 lbs dog and pathetic for thinking this is a funny story to tell people.  NTA!", "Spot on!!!", "If she starts demonstrating some empathy and acting like a parent. So sorry you went through that, too. That\u2019s awful, and it was all her fault.", "Oh ouch. This brings up so many sad memories. I am so sorry this happened to you. I hope you haven't lost your love of dogs! \n\nFor me it was the opposite.  I was diligent on the chain. My dad was not and well...the end happened the same.", "Yeah no, that's not how responsibility works with a 6 year old.\n\nMy son is 16 and quite frankly, stronger than me at this point. I will would never have him walk the dogs because they don't listen to him they way they listen to me. He has no desire to spend time training them to listen to him.  \n\nParents are responsible for parenting.  Your mother didn't do that and I'm so sorry it ended up so horribly for you and your dog.", "My rule of thumb was we were to get a dog only when I, the parent was able to do most of the care.  Children always swear that they will take care of a pet, but it's unrealistic to expect a 6 year old to do much beyond easy tasks.  The pet was your parent's responsibility not yours.", "I would think what a dumb parent!"]}
