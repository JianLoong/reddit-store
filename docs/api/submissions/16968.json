So my family celebrated mothers day early this past weekend & the moms were reminiscing on funny stories of their kids. My mom brought up how when i was 6 years old i \u201clet\u201d our family dog go because i \u201cthought it was funny\u201d & the dog ended up getting hit by a car & i \u201clearned a hard lesson in responsibility that night\u201d. This absolutely enraged me because I\u2019ve heard her say this before & I never thought it was funny. I think I might be the asshole because I said to mom I couldn\u2019t imagine being stupid enough to trust a 6 year old with a 60 pound dog that wasn\u2019t well trained, & then blame the child when the dog got away, especially given the fact i sobbed for hours that night because she told me it was all my fault. I said it was pathetic that she blamed me for the dog getting hit by a car because when the dog ran off I immediately told her what happened & she yelled at me to \u201cgo get the dog\u201d. It was a snow storm in January & I ran after the dog because I was terrified something would happen him. Cut to me having to watch my dog get hit by a car & have nightmares for weeks. I recounted these details & the room when totally silent for a minute but then someone changed the topic. My mom didn\u2019t speak to me for the rest of the party. \nThe next day my mom texted me saying that until i apologize to everyone at the party for disrespecting her Im not welcome to come around. I haven\u2019t responded yet & don\u2019t know what to say. I feel like i can\u2019t let this go & say sorry because I specifically remember this happening as it was incredibly traumatic to me.

You are correct, you were a child. She was irresponsible. She caused your dog\u2019s accident and your trauma. I\u2019m so sorry. Do not apologize. She owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't disrespect her, you just added all the details she skipped over in her version of the story. You don't owe anyone anything.", "You were 100% right for everything you said, and the rest of the family now knows the truth.\n\nDon't apologize for anything.  You didn't disrespect anyone.  NTA\n\nPlease check out r/JUSTNOMIL  and r/raisedbynarcissists There is a lot of help and advice in those forums.", "NTA. You reacted so strongly because you are still traumatized by this experience and her not realizing it or demanding that you apologize for it is so self-centered. Maybe reply to her text describing exactly that you don't feel welcome to come when your childhood trauma is a source of amusement for her and she hasn't realized how deeply that hurt you. Maybe that will make her stop for a moment and think.", "NTA. It was about time you called out her bad parenting on that night. She owes you an apology, not the other way round.", "NTA\n\nWhat in the world was your mom thinking? You were SIX and she's a grown adult. You don't owe her an apology. If anything just cut contact with her since she seems to put you down a LOT. If there is a next time try to bring up something embarrasing about her in front of family. That will teach her!", "Let me air out my bad parenting skills and blame it on my child! NTA OP because your mom has a warped sense of what's funny if she thinks the dog getting hit by a car and blaming you is worth a chuckle from others.", "NTA This is a lousy thing to do to even an adult kid. Losing a family pet when we are children can be devastating. How many reading this recall their first pet? Surely she realizes how much this hurts you. And yes, to trust a 6 year old with any dog, let alone a large, untrained one, just silly. Your mom was the one responsible for your dog getting hit by the car, not you, BTW", "NTA\n\nYour mom needed this wake up to how much this hurt YOU.  Your mom needs a hard talking to about what is appropriate.  She brought it up at a family get together.  You responded at a family get together.  Some things are not funny and should be left in the past.", "NTA\n\nSee how your mom reacts to your trauma? Getting along doesn't mean you have a good relationship...", "NTA - sounds like your mom has very low self esteem and tries to take it out on others to make herself feel better. \n\nI'm so sorry you had such a traumatic experience with your dog. You were right to call out her responsibility in the matter. The only one who owes any apologies is your mother.", "NTA \n\nYour mom sucks. Not only for the party but that entire situation with the dog is fucked up. \n\nMy sister used to do stuff like this every Christmas. I finally her confronted a few years ago and threatened to no longer attend family gatherings if she wanted to keep doing it.", "NTA- I'm missing the part where anything you said was inaccurate. Who the hell leaves a 60 pound dog in the charge of a 6 year old and then blames them when everything goes wrong?? Your mother sounds awful", "NTA. Don't go around, go no contact. That's not a funny story in experience or context, and your mother's need to retell is telling. She sounds toxic.", "NTA and that was not disrespecting - it was giving an accurate accounting of what happened.  If anyone was disrespected, it was you.  Info: is she always such an AH?", "NTA. Is anyone else from the party asking you to apologise? Because if not, let her wait for her sorry and maybe get in touch to others and remind them that you owe no apologise for telling the truth. Where is right for a mother to make fun of such an event ?", "NTA and after\n\n>my mom texted me saying that until i apologize to everyone at the party for disrespecting her Im not welcome to come around.\n\nyou need to stay away from her. She deserved everything she got.", "NTA.  You're an adult and she is an adult.  You deserve respect and she failed to give it.  Your mom finds joy in making you the butt of her jokes and it came back to bite her.  Whether you make up or not she will think twice next time. Leave her to stew in it.", "NTA. Please do not apologize for recounting your recollection of the event she brought up.\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc9b", "NTA - She brought it up to shift the blame. This is not a funny story from your childhood - it's traumatic. If she does not want to discuss this rationally, you may want to rethink the relationship. She sounds like a \"treat.\"", "You supplied details from her \u201cfunny story\u201d that she left out.   She\u2019s upset because the true facts make her (rightfully) look like an appalling parent \n\nIs she going to apologize for trying to shame you in front of everyone for something that happened (and traumatized you) when you were a child of six??  \u2026\n\nNTA", "I hate this culture of parents mentioning embarrassing stories about their kids, without their consent for \u201chumor\u201d. My mom did this a couple of times and I shut it down pretty much immediately! As a kid I was expected to keep all \u201cfamily matters within the four walls of our home\u201d. Okay?! So what now, I\u2019m not family or why the double standards?\n\nNTA! Good on you for shutting that ish down and keep doing it! Parents say the most hurtful things and then wonder why their kids don\u2019t want to talk to them anymore.", "NTA\n\nJust send her screenshots of the comments. Of course you don't owe her an apology. Unless she is one of those people who has a really skewed way of thinking, she knows a lot those who heard the story lost respect for her. That is probably what's bothering her most.", "If she wanted ppl to think she was a good mom she would\u2019ve been a better mom", "NTA. Im sorry that happened to you.", "NTA-she brought it up and you should be able to tell your side of the story.", "NTA.\n\nDo NOT apologize. She is upset because she inadvertently displayed her sadism in public, and this time, you didn't cover. Everyone at the party saw what she is.\n\nYour life, your choice. Having said that. And having \"family\" like her. She is sick in the head. I guarantee you will be much happier the less contact you have with her. Block her. She'll chase you, or send her puppets. Let her rot. Live your life in peace.", "NTA, disrespecting her was appropriate and she earned it so you shouldn't apologize for it, she should apologize to you but she won't.", "NTA - and the answer is that you don't respond. I'm sure there are plenty of actually funny stories from when you were a child. That was absolutely NOT one of them and your mom is a total asshole for telling it, a bigger asshole for telling it the way she did.", "NTA. She can have some respect when and if she starts demonstrating some empathy and acting like a parent. So sorry you went through that, too. That\u2019s awful, and it was all her fault. I can\u2019t believe she was so cruel and irresponsible when you were SIX, ffs.\n\nYou did learn a hard lesson, tho. You learned your mom wasn\u2019t there for you when you needed her. That sucks.", "NTA, there is no reason to tell that story, it isn't cute, it isn't endearing it is tragic.", "NTA at all. She needs you to apologize because that room of people probably agree that she sucks right now.", "NTA. your mother is cruel.", "Please show your mother this post she needs to realise how wrong she was and is still being this is unacceptable. Just reply to her text saying you want me to apologise? How about you take a look at this post and send her a link. I'd love to know what she says after reading all the comments agreeing with you and how poor her behaviour was and still is.", "ESH. her story is inappropriate and not funny. but the adult thing to do is talk to her in private about this and ask her to stop telling the story. or respond in a dignified way. neither of you are acting like adults.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She refused to take him to the vet his whole life. I think reading these comments made me realize shes been making herself look bad by telling this story because like someone else said, who TF trust a child with a  dog?", "I never thought of this. I suppose she does. It was one of the first stories she ever told my fiance about me. We just had a good laugh when we realized her telling this story inherently makes her look bad for trusting a child with a dog \ud83d\ude02", "I definitely avoid disagreeing with her because it always ends up like this\u2026 i genuinely dont think she has ever apologized to me once in my life. Im always the one apologizing. She can never admit shes wrong. She usually has these big emotional reactions & acts likes she\u2019s victim even if its because i call her out for something shitty she said or did. If i do call her out, im disrespectful. She takes no accountability for the hurt she causes.", "No, no one has said anything to me.", "her mother seems needlessly cruel if she decided to tell the story in public, she can handle a public reaction to her own awful parenting.", " Her reasoning was I wanted the dog so i had to be responsible to take care of it. She had a system set up where I was supposed to attach the dog to the chain before I opened the door to let it out. But being a child i guess i dropped the ball on that.", "I say this because my mom has poor self-esteem and is constantly looking for ways to belittle other people.

Fun times!!\" Who does that?", "Time to go low contact", "Every child wants a dog when they\u2019re young! You were just a kid being a kid. You can\u2019t expect a child to be able to be a perfectionist in anything hence why there\u2019s parents there that are _supposed_ to teach us. I\u2019m sorry you had such a bad experience", "Still very much on her. NTA", "She tells the story as i let the dog go on purpose & told her while laughing about it, thinking it was funny. Her version doesn\u2019t even make sense now that i think about it \ud83d\ude44", "Agreed! If she cannot take an accountability for hurt she causes, then don't give her the opportunity to continue doing so.  \n\nMy mom (who was a genuinely nice person) did something similar to me by retelling a story that made me look bad and her like the victim - I pointed out to her privately how her behaviour caused the incident - she never brought that story up again.   Didn't apologize, but never brought it up again.", "My mum is hit or miss depending on how emotionally tied she is to the issue. Sometimes she respects a no but other times she makes herself the victim to maintain control. Lack of emotional regulation I think."]}
