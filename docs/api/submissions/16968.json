NTA. \n\nI had a slightly similar experience. My mom used to tell this story about how I got hurt once and she dragged herself out of her sick bed (she had the flu) and took me to the hospital. And then once there collapsed and the nurse rushed to help her. The point of the story was to highlight what a great mom she was for me. \n\nAnd being a kid I just accepted it and nodded and smiled. Until one day when I was about 13-14, one of the people my mom was telling this story to asked the following question: \"Wait? She had cut her foot so badly blood was spurting? She was in shock and couldn't speak? What do you mean, you felt terrible but pulled yourself out of bed anyway. What alternative did you have, mymom'sname? Were you going to lie there because you were tired and watch your child bleed to death? Getting your bleeding child to a doctor is the least you could do. And if you collapsed at the hospital with a child who was bleeding, I doubt they all ran to you and how would you know if you passed out?\" \n\nAnd it was like a lightbulb went off in my head, as my mom sulked away. I had just accepted all these stories my whole life but *now* as I listened to them, I could finally pick out where my mom was gliding over the mistakes she made and focusing on how 'funny' it was that I made these mistakes as a child.\n\nThat's a narcissist thing your mom is doing. She's making sure that whatever happened, is never her fault. And if she has to blame and traumatize a small child to do it, so be it. She'll never see it that way. She's just remaking the world so she's the good one and other people are not real people just props in her story. Realizing that my mom didn't actually see me as a separate / real person from her was both a blessing (oh, none of this is actually my fault and I\"m not a bad person) and a curse (oh dip, my mother didn't give me the love a child needs and I've got issues from that - hello insecure attachment).\n\nYou did not disrespect your mom by pointing out the inconsistencies of her story. Except in her mind. You don't have to accept her world view. Being a gray rock with my mom and just being me without caring about her response (after some years of therapy to learn how) was the most freeing thing ever.\n\nDon't apologize. She'll suddenly start talking to you again when she needs or wants something and this little kerfluffle will have never happened. Keep telling yourself ... trash takes itself out. You lose nothing by having this space. And if you can, get a good therapist and learn that you deserve love and nothing you did is why you got someone who didn't love you the way you deserve.", "NTA and this is how nc landed in your lap, if thats what you want :)", "So she gets to endlessly shame you for something that truly wasn\u2019t your fault and wants an apology also?

I ll never bring a loss of pet in any conversation unless he likes to talk about it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You are so right, it\u2019s her fault for not being the adult in that situation and caused you to be traumatized. Woman needs to take accountability", "NTA. My mother did that same stuff to me all my life. I, at age 52, finally went no contact about 15 months ago. These have been the most peaceful months of my life.  I have no time for the hurt, the demands, the manipulation, the bs anymore. You deserve better.", "Your mom plays that game wrong \u2014 every time I do this with my mom friends it\u2019s really a humble brag to show off how funny, witty, creative and cute our kids were when they were young, with an added bonus of making them squirm a little because embarrassing your kids with adorable stories will never not be fun to us moms.\n\nWhat we don\u2019t do is used said opportunity to rehash some serious childhood trauma. Your POV not withstanding, she would have still made herself look like a total AH tbh, you just said what everyone else was thinking because in no way shape or form did that anecdote qualify to discuss with anyone other than a therapist. \n\nYou deserved better and I\u2019m so sorry. Sending you mom hugs. \n\nYou are also most definitely NTA.\n\n** edited for grammar", "NTA I think she is doing you a favor telling you not to come around. Stiffen your spine and don\u2019t give in to her.", "NTA. Good for you for putting her straight. It was absolutely irresponsible of her to have a 6 year old dealing with a dog that big by themselves. I would respond:\n\n\u201cEverything I said was true. It isn\u2019t disrespectful to have the full version of events laid out for people. Also, I do not appreciate you propensity to bring up past events in an attempt to humiliate me. I have no intention of coming around until you apologize to me for continuing this hurtful behavior. You will not be welcome around me or my (kids and husband/wife if you have them) until you do so.\u201d", "Nta she was being unkind to you and you called her out on it.", "NTA, your mother definitely is, and this is why kids grow up and go low or no contact with parents who are simply awful.", "NTA. My mother does this also, blames me for her irresponsible parenting. Example: as a child i loved to read and go to the library, we lived rurally and invariably she would not get my library books back in time and the library would charge a couple of euro in fines. Then she would scream at me for not bringing my books back. We lived rurally 12 miles from town and how the hell can an 8 year old remember its 3 weeks from when i took the books out. Eventually she stopped allowing me take books out.\nFast forward to last year my 9 year old neice now also loves the library. At my bros house for a family occasion my mother said to my neice in front of everyone \"well i hope your not going to be like *my name* and forget to bring your books back so SIL will have to pay fines.\nI saw red and said to her, would it be neices fault if the books werent back in time since she's 9 and cant read a calender or would it be SIL's responsibility same as it should have been yours when i was her age?\nShe shut up real quick.\nBoundaries are important OP, dont let her shame you as an adult for her shitty behaviour, keep calling her out.", "NTA.  Your mom is cruel.", "NTA. Best response \"Don't threaten me with a good  time!!!\"", "NTA. Not at all. There's absolutely nothing funny about that story, and it's bizarre and creepy that she would tell it. Stand your ground and give her all the space she wants. I'd go no contact.", "NTA. Tell her you will apologize only after she apologizes to you for every time she brought it up. Let alone for telling a small child to go get a big dog back on her own. Apparently, she was not concerned that you could be hurt or killed, only the dog. This was probably the real reason everyone was silent before changing the subject. Not because of what you said, but because she outed herself about her lack of caring about your outcome, only the dog.", "To bad she'll never receive one!", "Even if this was actually their fault, and the mother told a truthful account of what happened, the mother would still be an asshole, because this is not a funny story no matter how you frame it. It's sad and traumatic.", "NTA.  She is the one who should apologize & I\u2019d probably go NC with such a toxic person whether they apologized or not.", "She didn't even bring the poor dog to the vet after it got hit by a car", ">The next day my mom texted me saying that until i apologize to everyone at the party for disrespecting her Im not welcome to come around. I haven\u2019t responded yet & don\u2019t know what to say.\n\nOpie, that is the perfect excuse to cut the cord on this relationship. Honestly, NTA. She should rethink her past parenting.", "Yeah, OP can respond with \"Don't threaten me with a good time!\"", "Ugh, I had one of those embarrassing experiences as well. I drank too much at a family dinner several hours after I found out a family friend was dying (not same family as the one I was with). Of course I got sick.\nOne of the family members told that story to EVERYONE who would listen, people who had just met me or not at all. Even though I brought up many times that I didn't think it was funny.\nWell that family member has passed, and I really miss them and feel bad for their family, but I am very relieved the story is no longer making the rounds.", "Mom is this you? \ud83e\udd74", "So you're saying that she should've just let the family believe her mother's lies?", "[removed]", "u/DizzyTemperatur is a bot.", "Aww- I posted the same thing.", ">Watch your mental health improve in her absence. You can visit relatives when you know she's not there.\n\nI agree and support this idea wholeheartedly.", "Oh yes. Mom's just butt hurt she cannot spin her failure on her 6 yo daughter anymore. And people listened and know now how shitty she was and still is as a mother.", "Me, too.", "Right? That's like the same size as a six year old human", "I think that's called 'double bind.' That term might be helpful. It's a common manipulative tactic where you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. In this example you are damned because you allegedly got a dog hurt (you didn't) but if you speak up about it, you're also damned because you're being 'rude'. \n\nA double bind is when anything you do will get you in trouble.", "Your mother is, at least to sone extent, a narcissist.  Time to put some distance between you.", "NTA I'm so sorry. How disappointing and exhausting.", "I say do it anyway. It will just further prove your point.", "sure, but it makes OP look bad.", "yep. that's what it means to be a dignified grown up. you don't have to stoop to the mom's level.", "Amen.", "Are Goobers fair game?", "/u/Realistic_Power_4219 is a scammer!  **It is stealing comments** to farm karma in an effort to \"legitimize\" its account for engaging in scams and spam elsewhere.
