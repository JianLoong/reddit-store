NTA. \n\nI had a slightly similar experience. My mom used to tell this story about how I got hurt once and she dragged herself out of her sick bed (she had the flu) and took me to the hospital. And then once there collapsed and the nurse rushed to help her. The point of the story was to highlight what a great mom she was for me. \n\nAnd being a kid I just accepted it and nodded and smiled. Until one day when I was about 13-14, one of the people my mom was telling this story to asked the following question: \"Wait? She had cut her foot so badly blood was spurting? She was in shock and couldn't speak? What do you mean, you felt terrible but pulled yourself out of bed anyway. What alternative did you have, mymom'sname? Were you going to lie there because you were tired and watch your child bleed to death? Getting your bleeding child to a doctor is the least you could do. And if you collapsed at the hospital with a child who was bleeding, I doubt they all ran to you and how would you know if you passed out?\" \n\nAnd it was like a lightbulb went off in my head, as my mom sulked away. I had just accepted all these stories my whole life but *now* as I listened to them, I could finally pick out where my mom was gliding over the mistakes she made and focusing on how 'funny' it was that I made these mistakes as a child.\n\nThat's a narcissist thing your mom is doing. She's making sure that whatever happened, is never her fault. And if she has to blame and traumatize a small child to do it, so be it. She'll never see it that way. She's just remaking the world so she's the good one and other people are not real people just props in her story. Realizing that my mom didn't actually see me as a separate / real person from her was both a blessing (oh, none of this is actually my fault and I\"m not a bad person) and a curse (oh dip, my mother didn't give me the love a child needs and I've got issues from that - hello insecure attachment).\n\nYou did not disrespect your mom by pointing out the inconsistencies of her story. Except in her mind. You don't have to accept her world view. Being a gray rock with my mom and just being me without caring about her response (after some years of therapy to learn how) was the most freeing thing ever.\n\nDon't apologize. She'll suddenly start talking to you again when she needs or wants something and this little kerfluffle will have never happened. Keep telling yourself ... trash takes itself out. You lose nothing by having this space. And if you can, get a good therapist and learn that you deserve love and nothing you did is why you got someone who didn't love you the way you deserve.", "NTA and this is how nc landed in your lap, if thats what you want :)", "So she gets to endlessly shame you for something that truly wasn\u2019t your fault and wants an apology also?

I'm glad you got in touch with your anger and in the heat of the moment set a boundary.", "I skipped the pathetic part. But I'm failing to see how you're at fault, either. She has been lauding this over your head for years, bringing up painful memories to get a laugh for her and the crowd while shaming and putting you down. \n\nAnd she never told the true details of what happened because it would make her look like an ass. You did tell the truth. You don't owe an apology. She owes you one for that day and every time she used that story to put you down.", "That's just the truth. You said nothing that was factually incorrect. She is stupid for trusting a 6 year old with a 60 lbs dog and pathetic for thinking this is a funny story to tell people.  NTA!", "Spot on!!!", "If she starts demonstrating some empathy and acting like a parent. So sorry you went through that, too. That\u2019s awful, and it was all her fault.", "Oh ouch. This brings up so many sad memories. I am so sorry this happened to you. I hope you haven't lost your love of dogs! \n\nFor me it was the opposite.  I was diligent on the chain. My dad was not and well...the end happened the same.", "Yeah no, that's not how responsibility works with a 6 year old.\n\nMy son is 16 and quite frankly, stronger than me at this point. I will would never have him walk the dogs because they don't listen to him they way they listen to me. He has no desire to spend time training them to listen to him.  \n\nParents are responsible for parenting.  Your mother didn't do that and I'm so sorry it ended up so horribly for you and your dog.", "My rule of thumb was we were to get a dog only when I, the parent was able to do most of the care.  Children always swear that they will take care of a pet, but it's unrealistic to expect a 6 year old to do much beyond easy tasks.  The pet was your parent's responsibility not yours.", "I would think what a dumb parent!", "I respect people until they disrespect me.  When I was ten, I was dragged by our 60-pound lab.  Your mom was a fool to give you the leash.  You could of been hurt.  It's not a funny, cute story.  and trust me, most of those people were thinking wtf. A couple of times my son has left the door loose... my cat is ten and has no teeth.  Is something happened to her, there is no way I'd lay that guilt trip on him.  nta", "NTA - What a traumatic event for you to have endured as a child. The fact your mother continues to bring it up as a joke/life lesson is insufferable. She owes YOU an apology. I hope you share this thread with her. I doubt anyone is going to bat for her.", ">The next day my mom texted me saying that until i apologize to everyone at the party for disrespecting her Im not welcome to come around. \n\nImagine how much more quiet & peaceful your life will be! No more humiliating or half-truth stories to to make you feel bad. \n\nNTA", "How could this have even fitted into the category of a funny stories about your kids? Your mum was deliberately telling a story that was meant to paint you in a bad light. Even if you hadn\u2019t of said anything to her, what would the rest of the family have thought - haha what a funny story of a child traumatised by the death of her dog! NTA", "So if anyone other than her invites you you're not allowed? I guess she forgot your am adult now and can't throw her mistakes at you. Don't apologize it want your fault at all. Nta", "As Autistic Abby wrote years ago: Sometimes people use \"respect\" to mean \"treating someone like a person\" and sometimes they use \"respect\" to mean \"treating someone like an authority\", and sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say \"if you won't respect me I won't respect you\" and they mean \"if you won't treat me like an authority I won't treat you like a person\" and they think they're being fair but they aren't, and it's not okay.\n\nNTA. Your mother is publicly shaming and embarrassing you for a situation from your childhood that was 100% her responsibility, and that's not okay. You're not being disrespectful to call her on that.", "NTA \n\nI mean\u2026 I am your age and I\u2019m learning that this is the age where we learn that our parents are people? \n\nYou are right, and she was wrong and she is probably used to speaking about you like a child, but make no mistake, EVERYONE listening to that story (at the party, and also when she told it before to other crowds, and even you right now listening with your adult ears) understands that you were a child - and so, it was her responsability.\nThis is why the room went silent when you spoke up for yourself.\n\nThe important thing here is that YOU understand this. As my therapist said recently, maybe don\u2019t expect her to change because people usually don\u2019t. But you can empathise and understand that she is used to being the one who tells storys, and talking about how she was \u201cteaching you responsability\u201d - she is lying to herself so hard that she had to turn it into some story. Deep down she knows it and was dreading this day. \n\nShe expects you to apologise \u201cto everyone\u201d ?? Lolol nobody needs this. You exist and your POV of the situation matters, or at least it is valid, no need to apologise (\u201cto everyone\u201d lol) for it.\n\nAnyway, NTA. But have a quiet, loving chat with just her and explain your side. Also, good for you for speaking up.", "NTA. I am horrified that your mom thinks this is \"funny\" or even an appropriate story to share with anyone except a therapist. I'm so sorry you grew up in an environment like that. Not talking to mom may be the best outcome.", "That\u2019s definitely on your mother. A story about a dog getting killed is not funny at all, especially at a social event.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm sorry a traumatic childhood event made anyone feel uncomfortable.\"", "NTA.", "NTA, that's some ridiculous shit.", "NTA and yikes! Your mom's lack of responsibility for letting their 6 year old handle the dog is down right jaw dropping. God bless you.", "Tell her after her \"lesson\" you learned not to let go again, so no, you will not be apologizing for her horrible parenting. NTA.", "NTA", "NTA guess you nipped that story in the bud! Bwahahahahahaha!", "That's ruff buddy", "NTA. When your mother is ready to apologize for her terrible behavior (then AND now), maybe you'll be willing to go see her again. That is a terrible story and she's an A H for recounting it.", "NTA.\n\nYou DID disrespect her, because that\u2019s exactly what she deserved. You showed her exactly the kind of response she needed, and the fact that she thinks you need to apologize is incredibly telling.", "NTA. And take her up on her offer of never speaking again.", "The funny thing you need to remember is everyone who heard that story now thinks less of her and probably think your mom is the one who should apologize. If they don't then they all suck.", "INFO please- does your mother bring up other things your siblings did as young kids to shame/ laugh at them, in other words, is this a pattern of behavior from her?", "Nta. You don't automatically get a free pass from being an asshole because you're a parent. The fact you're a parent should mean that you aren't an asshole to your kids. No matter how old they are.", "Nta. Your moms a b", "Your mom sounds like a shit hole", "Ignore your cruel mother for awhile, a long while.\n\nShe had it coming.\n\nNTA", "NTA context is key and you added it fully.", "NTA- respond with I\u2019ll apologize when you stop being an asshole.", "NTA. Text her and tell her that until she apologizes to you and everyone at the party for her awful behavior towards you (putting you down, making fun of you, blaming you for things that are not your fault) your whole life, she is not welcome around you.", "NTA. You should simply text back \u201cI didn\u2019t disrespect you, I afforded you EXACTLY the level of respect your actions earned.\u201d\n\nFrankly tho, why do you still talk to her?", "This is the hill.\nNta", "NTA. I was told to apologize for finishing the story my mom started.  I\u2019m sorry if you were upset by the details but it\u2019s a memory I rather not hear about it. Again. Thanks for listening. \n\nYep there\u2019s the apology. And trust me. No one will say anything about it again and she\u2019s been outed. Brings it up again. Say I don\u2019t want to hear about the dead dog and watch everyone change the conversation.", "NTA. I'd give mom a year or two of no contact and then check to see how mad she still was. Personally, I would cut someone from my  life if they had treated me like that. And I have.", "ooooooo. NTA 3000. She needs to apologize to you and stop telling that story. You were SIX FFS. Why didn't she help you get the dog? Narcissist vibes on this one.\n\nMy mother used to do the exact same thing to me. ALWAYS. Her family thought I was a huge AH, probably still do since I never defended myself and we are NC now.  \n\"Oh, remember the time Sugarlump tried to burn the house down?\" Um, she gave me some ass old curling iron from the 1970s to use and I was using it in my bedroom because guests were in our bathroom, and we were in a hurry to go somewhere. The cord shorted and caught on fire while I was using it and I dropped it. It caught the side of my bed and the bed caught fire. I ran to her, and they were able to put it out. But I was blamed for TRYING TO SET THE HOUSE ON FIRE. I was about 12 years old.", "NTA, but your mom definitely is.  I would just cut her off.

But because i only surround myself wih healthy minded people anytime she tries to tell any of those awful stories people just look at her like shes evil incarnate. Its really fot her self concious lately and a bit insecure but im happy about it because that was messed up stuff people should be in prison for and she shouldnt get joy out of it and neither should ure mum! U did the best thing u could TELL THE WHOLE STORY her version just sounds like a daft oh well mistakes were made kinda story whereas the truth makes it a shes a very disgusting creature kinda story! And she should never be let off the hook for any of that behaviour!

You went through a traumatic event at 6yrs old and your mom did nothing to help you. She wants an apology because she knows she's the one who screwed up and is trying to cover her butt now.", "NTA, holy crap!  Is she trying to make everyone think you were a psycho? At 6 years old? \n\nWhy are you even speaking to her?  I would go no contact with her and tell everyone who tries to guilt you about it, exactly what kind of mother she was.", "NTA why do you even still talk to your mom?? Raging narcissist", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour mother tried to turn a story of parental irresponsibility, cruelty, and lack of empathy into a fun anecdote that would hurt and humiliate you in front of your extended family.\n\nYou responded with the truth.  \n\nYou have nothing to apologize for.  And from where I sit, not having to go around to be in the presence of someone who treats you like this, and then demands that YOU apologize (so it seems as if she's pretty much oblivious to the truth and lacking in insight) is a win for you.\n\nIt is very, very sad when our parents cannot offer the kindness we deserve.  It's sad to go back for more, hoping that they will have somehow changed into better (or at least different) people, or that this time will be different.  \n\nIt won't be different.  Even if there are nice times here and there, the in-between will be brutal.\n\nUnfortunately been there, done that.  Please, please back away from the open flame.  You'll get burned again and again.  She isn't going to change, but you can.  You can surround yourself with people who treat you with respect.  You can refuse to apologize when you've done nothing wrong no matter who in a dysfunctional family system thinks or did.  Or knows you didn't do anything wrong but wants you to abase yourself in order to keep the peace.\n\nPlease forget about keeping the peace here.  Keep the space.  A very big, wide open space.
