During my visits with her, when I related how I was being constantly picked on, she said that sometimes the only way to stop them was to fight them.  She knew what it was like, having been picked on herself, so I should respond with violence, as she herself had done as a child.\n\nI'm sure that counselor meant well, and was doing what she could in a very difficult situation.  But whether she meant to or not, she communicated the following:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This situation was on me to fix.\n* Nobody would help or support me.\n* I had a choice: continue to suffer at the hands of the bullies, or suffer consequences at the hands of school administrators if I acted in my own defense.\n\nThis is basically what OP's family has been communicating to OP...*but taking the additional step of shaming OP - a minor - for failing to fight back against their own mother.*\n\nu/ugenetai, unequivocally NTA.  Your aunt - and every last family member who has known what you've had to endure and has stood by and done nothing to intervene - can rot in hell.", "Actually, since she's trying to get OP to go to a shelter, after thinking about it, I think they just want OP to leave so her mom screams less and they don't have to hear it seeing as how they all live in the same apartment complex.", "Linda is WAAAAY off-base. That\u2019s not it Linda.", "So you were abused and you think that's normal...", "You're very, very smart for being able to see through the disparity between Linda's words and actions. NTA and I hope things get better for you soon.", "When someone's word and actions don't match, believe the actions. \n\nNo one has your back right now. None of these people are trustworthy.  My heart breaks for you. \n\nMany people can be trusted, none of them are among your bio-kin. Once you escape, and survive, you will have a lot of work to do to 'raise' yourself. Take care, take your time, get help.  Learning to trust anyone will not be easy, but put that on your to-do list.", "Yes, please get all of your important documents--birth certificates, social security cards (or similar if not in the US), etc. and keep them somewhere safe. I know that might be easier said than done at your age, but your family may \"lose\" them, at best, or just keep them from you to prevent you from leaving. \n\nI believe that domestic violence programs often offer advice for prepping to leave an abuser, you may want to research this at the library too. While some of it may not apply to you, I bet a lot of it will. \n\nAnd you're NTA, at all.", "Get every promise in writing.\n(Saying this as a friend of several veterans and the the daughter of a veteran)", "That's far from abusive. If you missed out, you had to pour yourself a bowl of cereal or whatever. Mom and dad and whatever sibling made it is not going to sit with cold food just waiting for you to decide to come in the house. If you are in the house after dinner was over, well then that's just tough luck.  It shows a level of respect and it taught us to be on time and not be someone who's always late to everything.", "Or, Aunt doesn't feel guilty, just likes watching the drama and pretending to \"ride into the rescue\" after everything has blown over.", "Or that when you find someone who ACTUALLY CARES you won\u2019t push them away.", "And the one that is a coward is the aunt & the family that is not calling out OP\u2019s mothers treatment of the children.", "I picked up on that too!!!", "*\"Are there no workhouses?\"*", "Don't you see, if OP leaves then their mom will yell less which will be better for all the relatives that live in the same complex and have to hear it everyday?\nNot sarcasm because after thinking about it for half a day that's what I think is going on here. I think the relatives want to reduce the noise pollution.", "NTA\n\nWhat exactly is Linda\u2019s goal here? Just to give your mother a peace of her mind via you? She wants SOMEONE to stand up to her, but doesn\u2019t want to face any consequences.\n\nYou are the one that will face the consequences and going to a homeless shelter is not a reasonable risk to take. You are being smart and bidding your time. Linda does not have your best interest at heart.\n\nI am very sorry for your situation", "NTA. think you already know this but don't do anything without a plan. Can you manipulate mom to send you to college? If you are away at college it makes exiting a lot easier. It can be the shittiest college. The point is you will be away from home and free to work part-time.\n\nYou need to figure out a way to earn money. You need a secret bank account. Try streaming/creating YT videos, maybe Etsy or other art stuff. Or try to do homework, essays, or projects for others. If you have a bicycle you can do door dash or Uber eats. \n\nYou have to find a way to save money that mom doesn't have access to or you will never get out.\n\nYou need enough money for \n\n1. Car(secondhand is okay) \n\n2. At least 4-6 months of living costs (rent, phone, and utilities)", "Nta, she's not a good person to take advice from. She's literally telling you to go be homeless. Don't trust her. She's as bad as your mom. She literally sees the abuse and wants it to get worse rather than actually help you.", "NTA - they are not grown up enough to stand up to your mum And won\u2019t save you if it goes south When you do. Hope you can get help through school. Good luck.", "NTA, the only coward here is your aunt, telling a teenager to SLEEP IN A SHELTER instead of letting you take her couch for a little while. She doesn't get to demand you stand up to your mom when she's unwilling to do even the most minor things to shield you from the consequences. I'm so angry on your behalf right now, I'm so sorry the adults in your life won't protect you.", "Nta", "Nta. If they \u201ccared\u201d they wouldn\u2019t just talk about it, they\u2019d be about it", "NTA. They are supporting her by their lack of action. You are a child. You arent the one who needs to be responsible for changing your moms behavior. Stay safe", "NTA anyone who thinks a shelter is a safe place to go is a moron. Ignore her.", "OP I am so sorry you are going through this. You definitely are NTA. Your aunt is guilty. Your whole family is letting you down and I am so sorry. I hope you are able to find resources to help you get away.", "NTA, you prove to be wise with your penultimate paragraph saying she is easing her own conscience, which is exactly right. Best of luck in your endeavours to escape, hopefully you can get a job and rent somewhere at some point soon to escape this situation.", "\\> I asked Linda \"when I stand up to my mom and I face consequences as a result of that, would you take me in?\" She deflected and said I'm old enough to take responsability for myself.\n\nThen you should ask your aunt what happened before, when you weren't old enough to take responsibility for yourself.  Why didn't she do anything back when you were only 13?  And keep asking the same question so she doesn't deflect", "NTA your aunt suggesting that you could live in a shelter rather than tow the line is heartbreaking. If she objects with how your mom treats you, she could confront her herself and suffer the consequences. The family members need to confront your aunt for stirring the pot, (and your Mom for how she treats you,) not blaming you.", "NTA \n\nPlease have an escape plan ready when you turn 18. I'm so sorry you live in such a toxic environment with people who won't protect you. \ud83d\ude2a", "Also, 17 is not an adult. OP still needs physical and emotional adult resources she likely doesn't have access to in order to successfully separate herself from this situation. OP, you are absolutely NTA for doing what you need to do to survive.", "NTA, nor are you being unreasonable or thorny. How kind of her to suggest you go to a shelter and food bank. \ud83d\ude44", "And minors can't go to those places. And if you're in a shelter you can't cook so a food shelf is useless. It's ridiculous how dumb people are.", "No point in calling out toxic people - a simple, \"no thank you.\" And no explaination required for managing your own life", "Here in Canada a fellow student in Engineering was being put through Engineering by the military for a time commitment to serve when done - 4 year university program for 4 years of service I think.", "Agreed. My mom is the oldest of 3 sisters. My aunts will constantly tell me how bad she's doing on a decline, but they won't touch her with a fuckin yard-stick. \n\nThis is a bullshit thing to put on a kid, props to OP for  putting accountability right back on her.", "If you're in the US you might want to call 211 and confirm that any of these charities are helping people with these specific situations in your particular state BEFORE you take a stand against your mother.
