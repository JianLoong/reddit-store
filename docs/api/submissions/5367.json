It's interesting how someone who says you can \"take responsibility for yourself\" is so insistent about telling you what to do.", "Firstly, I'm so sorry you are stuck in this situation at all! I've been there with my own family (both the abusive mother and the family that \"helps\" without actually helping). \n\nYou are right in your approach, burning this bridge too early could be detrimental - there's a song floating around on YouTube that puts it very well:\n\n\"It's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay\n\nThis issue is temporary so attempt to wait for one more day\n\nStep back from the situation, the world's not a movie, it's not fiction\n\nYou can't think, \"Say it, they'll accept it\"\n\nSome people kick you down just because you're different\n\nIt's gonna be okay, it's gonna be okay\n\nThis issue is temporary so attempt to wait until you're safe\n\nBe rational\n\nUnless you think they won't attack at all\n\nYou gotta keep it in man, be practical\n\nAnd I know you feel trapped and small right now but you'll come out alive\"\n\nHang in there OP, the time between now and moving out will go quickly and you'll be free!", "NTA. Your aunt is beyond pathetic. If you violate your moms rules, you\u2019ll be abused and, worst case scenario, kicked out with no money and no way of providing for yourself. You know what happens to your aunt if she sticks up for you to your mom? LITERALLY NOTHING. She\u2019s a coward and her \u201chelp\u201d is nothing more than adding to your moms bullying.

Op NTA. Hang in there, hope you find someone that actually help you.", "NTA. I'm sorry no one is there for you.  I hate it when people say you made them feel guilty by pointing out the shitty things they did.  They feel guilty because of their own actions and so they should.  Not sure where you are,  but maybe look into local aid organisations that might help you get out.  Good luck.  Stay safe.", "NTA. Your family sounds horrible. I'm sure as soon as you become independent, you'll get away from all of them and never look back. You ARE surviving. You are handling this very well, in a clear-eyed way. You'll be all right.", "NTA. Your relatives are doing nothing to help. If they really wanted to help, they'd actually be working on getting you out of there. Their \"attempts to help\" are just so they can say they did whatever they could. Lip service is the same as silence. Actions speak louder than words. \n\nWhat you need to do is work on keeping your grades up and your head low for now. As soon as you get close to graduation, start applying for scholarships. Look into schools that have dorms and housing/financing assistance. Look for the really obscure scholarships that hardly anyone applies for, as you're more likely to get them. Talk with friends you have and see if you can move in with them as soon as you're 18 just until you can get a job and get your own place. If you can't get a job, look into free classes and volunteer work to build skills and connections (I've heard FEMA offers quite a lot, depending on where you are, and I know animal shelters and libraries are always a good place to look for volunteer opportunities). I know military might seem appealing, but try to avoid going into any branch unless you've got no other option. Also, talk to the librarian at your school or the public library for ideas and assistance. They can connect you to resources to help you get on your feet. \n\nDo what you have to do in order to get by for now.", "NTA If you are hanging out at the library, focus on your schoolwork. If you are poor you still can be smart. Confide in a school counselor (female) and ask the counselor if you can apply for a work-study program as soon as you are 18. It is okay to make a family with nice people over time and not to contact mean family members again. Toxic people make a choice to be toxic and you rise above it.", "Nothing wrong with going along to get along with a toxic authority figure until you can get away and become independent.  \"Standing up\" to your irrational mother is going to get you in for a world of punishment that your aunt won't have to suffer at all.

It\u2019s not all good though, so just weigh your options and see if that\u2019s what you really want. My one cousin became an alcoholic after his service so some deployments can be rough.
