Your Aunt Linda is a real piece of work. I think you are the one who was seeing the situation clearly and I'm so sorry that your family is unwilling to support or defend you.

Everyone else sucks except for you and your siblings.  You are stuck between a rock and a hard place.  \n\nYour family has enabled your mother's behavior by turning a blind eye towards it.  Your aunt basically telling you to leave one bad situation for another is horrible.  \n\nOnce you turn 18, your mother holds less control over you.
