The safety of you and your child is too important. I'd probably recommend asking him to leave you alone and then moving as far away as possible to comfort your kid rather than calling him a pathetic asshole. Never stir up crazy people.\n\nYou can also involve the bus driver.", "NTA. That guy sounds awful. Even if she\u2019d been crying for 15 minutes there\u2019s still a polite way to interact that doesn\u2019t involve yelling and cussing in a child\u2019s face.", "Please don\u2019t be embarrassed about a two year old crying. Their brains are still developing, and they aren\u2019t capable of modulating their emotions. Sending the message to your child that they shouldn\u2019t cry could lead to a very emotionally stunted person later on. It\u2019s good to be considerate of others but not at the expense of the normal development of a child. \n\nThe guy on the bus was horrible, regardless of what was happening in his life. Any good parent protects and sticks up for their child. NTA.", "NTA. A 2yo is going to understand the (threatening?) negative energy a stranger is directing at them and you absolutely should shield your kid from that.", "NTA \n\nProtecting your kid is a very normal thing to do. \n\nAnd honestly, don't worry too much about your kid crying on public transit or feel like you have to get off - just do your best to calm her. Kids making noise and fussing just comes with taking public transit.", "NTA. Fuck that guy", "Nta - I would called to the driver and asked he be kicked off the bus.", "NTA, and I am happy to hear that other passengers backed you up and told this rude idiot off.\n\nI mean, has this guy never been around a crying child before? Getting in their face, talking to them loudly and being rude was more likely to upset the child further and cause them to cry longer. \n\nWhilst your friend may be right that the guy might have been impatient and on edge for another reason, that doesn't excuse his behaviour towards her. Also, a 2yo can understand some words, and repeat words they've heard, and can understand tone of voice, and there absolutely was a point for standing up for her.", "NTA at all. I don\u2019t care if he had his own shit going on, you don\u2019t come at a young child because you just caught your wife cheating or whatever he had going on.", "NTA. I am often impatient and on edge and sensitive to loud noises (i.e., they make it worse). \n\nNever once have I gotten in a crying toddler\u2019s face to tell them to STFU.

The reflex urge to hit him straight in the face must have been incredible.", "NTA.  There's a difference between a stranger getting annoyed and saying something a little harsh to you, versus this totally unacceptable behavior.", "Nta. That man is unhinged..you should not engage because he's psycho. You aren't wrong for yelling at him, but he sounds scary.", "NTA Anyone saying shit like that to a toddler deserves to be called out", "NTA.  You and your crying kid have as much right to public transportation as loudmouthed assholes.  You paid your fare like everyone else. You don't have to apologize to anyone or get off the bus if your kid is crying.  That's the deal with PUBLIC transportation. You (and everyone else) have to tolerate the public.", "NTA, not at all. two year olds in an unfamiliar environment cry, its what they do. that man is a complete and utter asshole. the gall of that man to get into your child's face, insult, and swear at her is completely inexcusable. if that man was having a bad day like your friend suggested, taking out his anger at a defenseless toddler is NEVER the way to go about it. you had every right to protect your child, and i'm glad the other passengers were on your side.", "NTA, and your friend's views are troubling in multiple ways:\n\n(1) An adult getting in your toddler's face and cursing at them is *terrifying*. Hell, it would be scary for an adult. Of course you should protect them.\n\n(2) children crying \"setting people off\" - what the hell kind of world does this friend live in where the normal response to very common occurrences (an annoying noise) is what you described? YIKES", "Absolutely NTA!!! I did the exact same thing on a stalled subway last year. I was wearing the baby and my toddler was having an absolute meltdown (he was 2).

You best believe I started swearing up a storm on that train. And when the doors opened we left and I continued my tirade as we did. People are jerks.", "Nope.  NTA.  It is pretty darned pathetic for a grown man to be insulting a 2 year old.", "The baby can understand tone - she will be scared of this big scary shouty man. I don't care what he has \"going on\" - there are no excuses for shouting in a toddler's face like this.\n\nNTA.\n\nI'm impressed that you restrained yourself and only shouted at him.", "NTA. I HATE being next to crying babies in public spaces. But not once have I spoken to the mother about it in a rude way, let alone the child!!! This behaviour was unacceptable on the part of the guy. Good on you for shielding your child.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nHe is the AH but your friend is a close second. On no planet is there a justification for what he did.\n\nI\u2019m glad other passengers supported you.", "NTA.  i must sy though that this doesn't seem true.\n\nwhat kind of beta male would shout at a kid?? you should have called the police, if this story is true.\n\neither that man was mentally ill, or off his rocker on drugs.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
