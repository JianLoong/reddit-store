As part of having a friendship with me, she was around my brother (M, would be 30) quite a lot as children, and their romance blossomed as teenagers. They were married five years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, my brother passed two years ago in a tragic accident and left behind a mountain of debt for Brittany. She was eight months pregnant at the time, and ended up moving in with my parents. Her and her daughter, Lilac (2F), live with my parents to this day, and the family alternate watching Lilac so Brittany can get her degree. Everyone has really rallied around Brittany in such a trying time.\n\nFor Christmas, my husband (M30) bought an all-inclusive trip for him and I to explore Paris and have a romantic getaway. I have always had France on my wish-list, and I am so grateful to him for such a wonderful gift. We leave in Feburary for two weeks, and it is honestly a dream come true.\n\nI told my parents about the gift, and they then told Brittany, who called me in floods of tears asking that I take her instead of my husband. She said that she will never be able to experience a romantic getaway like that with her own husband, and that we (my husband and I) could just go again at another time. She said she gave up everything to raise Lilac and she would love for us to have a girls' trip like we did when we were younger.\n\nI told Brittany that that was not possible, this was a gift from my husband to me and I fully expected to have a romantic getaway with him. Brittany told me that I was punishing her for being a widow, and that it was unfair I would have a 'love affair in Paris' while she cried at my brother's grave.\n\nMy husband thinks she is trying to make me feel guilty, but said he would step out of the trip if I would like to take Brittany. The thing is that I want to go with my husband, but my parents have since called to tell me that they would watch Lilac and that I should not rub my happy marriage in Brittany's face. My mom told me I would be selfish to leave a grieving widow over Valentines Day.

That's such an unreasonable request and frankly if that's the way she feels, she should be going for therapy.

Because after all, she doesn\u2019t have a husband anymore.\n\nI understand how difficult it has been for her. It\u2019s a very sad story. But you guys are doing all you can to help her. I can\u2019t even believe she would ask you to do that. I think she\u2019s wallowing in self-pity a little too much or maybe she\u2019s just not thinking clearly . But it was a ridiculous request and there\u2019s no way in hell you should honor it.\n\nYour parents should also know better.  I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re thinking! A trip to Paris is not cheap. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to the local beach and you can afford to go there next year too. \n\nIt was a gift from your husband to you. Go with your husband and tell the rest of them that you should try to save for another trip and then you and her can go together maybe next year. \n\nyes, she lost her husband but you lost your brother.  i\u2019m sure you could use a little happiness in your life as well. Go to Paris. do not feel guilty. Enjoy the hell out of yourselves. The rest of them will get over it. If not, they\u2019re not very good friends/family.", "NTA\n\nTell your parents to take her and Lilac on a trip if they feel sorry for her.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a saint for asking, but this is a trip \\*he\\* paid for for \\*you and him.\\*  He's the one who gets to go.\n\nBrittany may have lost a partner, but you lost a brother. You need this time as much as she does.\n\nI'm sorry, but to quote Reba, the world doesn't stop for \\[her\\] broken heart.", "NTA. Your husband is right - Brittany is trying to make you feel guilty and is now working on your parents. What guarantee do you have that you and your husband could go again at another time? She lost her husband in an accident and must realise that you never know what might happen. Brittany is only 28 - it's possible that she will meet someone else, remarry, and have her own Paris love affair. Go with your husband and enjoy every minute.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nWhat happened to her is unfortunate and no one should have to experience that. But you can not stop living your life because she is a widow. You had your brother taken away from you so no one can argue that you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going through or anything like that. \n\nBeing a widow does not entitle you to a trip to Paris for two weeks.", "NTA\n\nGo with your husband.

I\u2019m sorry for you and your family\u2019s loss. It sounds like it\u2019s been a hard couple of years for you all and of course Brittany. HOWEVER, this has no connection to your husband wanting to take you away on a dream trip. It\u2019s quite worrying how manipulative both Brittany and your family seem to be about this situation. Go on the trip with your husband. It was a gift he bought for you to enjoy together. If you really want to compromise I suggest moving the trip from around Valentine\u2019s Day and offer to spend Valentine\u2019s with her. I can also confidently say having been to Paris on Valentine\u2019s Day you\u2019re not losing much. Paris is pretty romantic all year around.", "NTA. She has no right to hijack your damn trip.", "NTA. I often read these posts and wonder what the hell the extended family are thinking. Obviously it\u2019s tragic brittany lost her husband, but you lost your brother too so let\u2019s not forget that. I can\u2019t believe the entitlement expecting you to take her on holiday it\u2019s just wild", "NTA\n\nIt is tragic that she lost her husband and you lost your brother. But that does not mean that you are never allowed to enjoy your marriage. \n\nI'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say that her grief is making her see things in a strange way but you are allowed to be happy. Your happiness isn't rubbing anything in anyone's face.\n\nGo on the trip with your husband. Enjoy yourself. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty. \n\nAnd if your parents try to make you feel bad, tell them that you'd happily accept it if they paid for you and Brittany to take a girl's trip at a later date.", "NTA! This your trip with your husband!   You need to stand your ground.  Go and dont look back , if your family hold this over your head then they are   not worth having in  your life.", "NTA\n\nGo and enjoy your trip. I'm sorry she is miserable, and it's understandable, but that shouldn't prevent you from living your life.\n\nYou're not rubbing your happy marriage in her face. What does she expect - that you should pretend your marriage sucks?\n\nAlso, what she may or may not realise is that going to Paris is with you is not what she wants. What she really wants is to go to Paris with her late husband. Since that is impossible, it seems she wants to prevent you from enjoying the things she can't.\n\nThe reality is that you can support her in her grief but you can't take responsibility for her.", "NTA at all !! I am so sorry for the death of her husband but it doesn\u2019t give her any right to be entitled to you. She sounds like she is still grieving and she should definitely work through that with a therapist at least. Your parents are the assholes for asking you to give up something you always wanted to do and they sound very much entitled!! Why don\u2019t they take her to Paris if they\u2019re so worried then", "No. She had no concerns about being a lonely widow  on Valentine's day until she heard about your trip. \n\nI get it must be hard for her. Seeing people with their loved ones while she ost hers. It's probably tough, but most people would try to be excited for you and push the jealous and sad feelings aside, because she is your friend and should be happy that you DO have this romantic trip that will be wonderful. it's unreasonable to ask you to sacrifice yours because she is alone. \n\nI would instead plan a girls trip another time. But my gosh... I honestly don't think I'd want to go.", "NTA. Absolutely feel for you, your family and your SIL but I think your SIL has gotten a bit spoiled over the years.

What happened to her is tragic and I\u2019m so sorry for all of your losses but this is a special trip between you and your husband and I\u2019m honestly so blown away she invited herself tried to guilt trip you and the family is okay with this? Absolutely do not take her, do not do this to your husband or yourself, you go with your husband and have a good time. I\u2019m honestly like flabbergasted she tried to guilt trip you like that, like you are allowed to be happy in your marriage and do all the amazing fun things and you should! She needs a lot of therapy but she doesn\u2019t need to hijack your trip and if she went to therapy I\u2019m sure they would tell her the same thing.

If something good happens to you, will she always react like that? Inserting herself onto your life and have this weird expectation from you.\n\nNow is the time to set clear boundaries.", "NTA... And what kind of request is that? In what world would she think asking you to ditch your husband, who gave you the trip, is OK? Who does that lol\nEnjoy your trip with your husband and leave the guilt tripping at home.", "NTA Brittany is delusional. Girl go on your trip with your husband, and have fun.", "NTA and for goodness sake do NOT change anything!\n\nYour husband planned and paid for a wonderful romantic break for the pair of you - which includes Valentines Day.  If your mother is such a stirring control freak to tell you that it would be selfish point out to her that she and your dad could take Brittany on a trip.", "NTA. As harsh as it may sound, the whole point of a romantic getaway is the romance. You won't get that with your SIL. Instead you'll spend two weeks listening to her wishing how her husband/your brother was there to share it with her, especially if it falls during Valentine's. You will both spend the entire trip miserable.\n\nIt's all well and good saying that your husband and you can go on another trip some other time, but if your brother's passing proves anything its that life is too short to not spend time with your loved ones and make memories while you can.\n\nIf she's that adamant that you two have a girl's trip together suggest that the two of you go on a spa weekend. Somewhere closer to home, less expensive, and at a less emotionally wrought time of the year.", "NTA   They are all now gaslighting the hell out of you.  This is a gift from your hubs specifically for  you both and is important for that alone.  You are not responsible for how Brittany's feelings.  A good friend would never even THINK to ask you for that type of sacrifice.  As she well knows, life isn't fair or predictable and she's willing to rob you of good memories with your husband?   Just gross for your parent's to hop in on this as well.", "NTA.\nIt's understandable that she wishes it could be her, but it's not. Being a good friend means listening to that, being sensitive about how much she wants to hear about your trip and COULD mean planning a different trip together later on. But it doesn't mean rejecting the gift in the form your husband gave it to you. \nAlso, much as I sympathize with her pain, it's not like she will ever get to experience romance again (unless she chooses not to).", "Nope nope nope NTA. \n\nYou have been a good friend, you have been watching over your neice .\n\nDon't let Brittany bully you out of this trip. Don't let your parents bully you into not sharing this memory with your husband. \n\nGo on this trip and enjoy being together.  I am sure your brother would have wanted it this way.\n\nI wish you a wonderful trip", "NTA- what the hell??? All my condolences to Brittany but why should your husband's gift go to her?\nNo way. \nShe's emotionally blackmailing you and using her dead husband to do it. She's being very manipulative and I am shocked your parents don't see it how inappropriate she is being. \n\nThis is your Christmas present for your husband.

Do not change your trip.", "INFO: What if you stay with Brittany and I go with your husband? I'm a straight guy, so only minimal sex will be had between us.", "NTA\n\nSIL is absolutely out of line. The audacity!", "Nta. Do not do this op. Go with your husband.", "NTA.  Her widow status doesn\u2019t grant her free vacations at your expense.

I don't know what level of spare money you have but whether you could suggest you and her going away another time somewhere else?", "NTA AS A WIDOW MYSELF NTA she is weaponizing her grief. I get it\u2026 I so get it but life has to go on. That was the hardest thing for me was getting up each day and seeing my husbands face looking back at me with his blue eyes that dominate my daughters face. He passed on her 15th birthday and I had to get through each day to be her mom. I cried at the slightest smell that reminded me of him or a song we loved. But the thing is, my grief should not take away from my daughters grief and well being or my responsibility to that. Just like her grief should not take away from the grief of losing your brother nor should it take precedence over your love and you life with your husband. Do not give into this please you should not be made to feel guilty unless you INTENTIONALLY rub your life in her face.

Also if she thinks that she gave up everything for raising a child why did she have one? Not only that she should have been more vigilant about home finances if her husband/your brother was that bad with it to have so much debt.\n\nBut instead of thinking her life is over she should find happiness in everyday things and know that yes now is hard and it may seem like the storm will never pass but there is sun and it will shine on her again. And just because she has a child and she had one marriage doesn't mean she will not find someone in the future to go on a vacation. Time heal and make everything easier.", "NTA, stop telling people your business if it doesn't directly effect them!!", "F$ck no. \n\nGo with your hubby and ignore these people.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to be in therapy not on vacation. Your marriage has absolutely nothing to do with her. Your parents are just as ridiculous as she is. Tell them no and go on your trip just don\u2019t bring it up after you tell them no. Nip this in the bud now before she feels she can guilt trip you into other things.", "NTA\n\nDo not put Brittany feelings above the feelings of your husband, who planned the perfect romantic gift for his wife. That would be so unfair on him and a strain on your marriage for always putting your family first.\n\nThen tell your parents that their comments are grossly unfair and that the losing your brother shows how short life is. You could lose your husband the day after the trip and never get that time back. You love and support Brittany and your niece, but you refuse to stop living a married life because she is still (rightfully) grieving. You will support her with a trip later in the year - maybe over her wedding anniversary to make a horrible time a little easier (make your parents chip in for Brittany) but you won't lose memories on a romantic trip so lovingly planned by your husband. I would personally tell them how disappointed you are in their treatment of you, that Brittany has the right to feel how she feels, but they shouldn't attempt to shame you into not living a happy married life, parents should want that for their children.", "What the hell kind of entitled manipulation is happening here? Do not UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES take her on your trip!!!!!! NTA. I cannot believe the absolute nerve of some people.", "NTA\n\n>Brittany told me that I was punishing her for being a widow, and that it was unfair I would have a 'love affair in Paris' while she cried at my brother's grave.\n\nBrittany is in serious need of therapy. You're not at all punishing her or rubbing your marriage her face; you're simply going on a romantic trip with your husband for two weeks. This has absolutely nothing to do with her or your parents - who, by the way, need to reel their necks in and sit down.\n\nShe also needs to show some respect for the fact that her late husband was your brother, too, and that she isn't the only one who is grieving his passing. I imagine a part of why your husband planned this trip is to give you a break from the last two years and provide a distraction from your loss for a while. You're allowed to want to do something nice for yourself without guilt or pressure to give in to Brittany's demands just because she's widowed. Also, it would be extremely rude and unfair on your husband to expect him to be happy to change the nature of his gift to something he would no longer be a part of but still have funded. If Brittany is so desperate to go away with you, then you can plan it together and she can stump up her share of the costs.\n\nEDIT: Somehow I managed to miss this.\n\n>My husband thinks she is trying to make me feel guilty, but said he would step out of the trip if I would like to take Brittany.\n\nI can't decide if your husband is being generous or stupid for saying this, but you should absolutely, 100%, **NOT** take him up on it. If you give in to Brittany now, it'll open the door for her to make further unreasonable demands and you risk never being able to do anything again with your husband without her heaping on the guilt and jeopardising you. \n\nBuild those boundaries tall and strong, OP. Do not give in.", "NTA, absolutely you should not sacrifice your trip with your husband. Your SIL is guilt tripping you to a degree that she should be ashamed of herself.", "This request is in no way reasonable.  The logic doesn\u2019t even stack up.  Have there been other instances where she has used her grief to try and manipulate you or your parents? What happened in an absolute tragedy, for her and your entire family.  That doesn\u2019t entitle her to free vacations paid for by your husband.  She needs therapy ASAP, this isn\u2019t normal, but grief does very strange things to a person.  Either that or she\u2019s getting entirely too comfortable/becoming entitled to your assistance.  You would be doing your husband a disservice by taking her instead of him. NTA.", "SO clearly NTA!!  PLEASE do not give up such a beautiful gift from your husband for this woman who is exhibiting such spoiled, ridiculous behavior.  I have sympathy for her situation and it is so unfair that she lost your brother and has to raise the child alone.  However, your family has gone above and beyond to help her.  Even the fact that she felt ok about even calling to ask is just mind blowing to me.  I have to wonder if her parents just told her she was amazing all the time and never, ever told her the word \u201cno\u201d.  I would bet money on it.  If you do decide to take her, it will absolutely have a negative effect on your marriage.  I can just about promise that.  If your husband was kind enough to offer, it will cause him to wonder how much you are truly committed to him.  Show her these responses and explain that this is one of those times that she has stepped right out of her lane and that not only would you NEVER consider something so ludicrous, she needs to evaluate why she ever thought it would be ok to ask something so huge that she did not deserve, earn or have anything to do with SIMPLY because she wanted it. And from all you have said, that is truly the only reason she could ever have to back up her request.  Following her logic. I could go ask the family of one of my best friends who passed suddenly to just give me his truck or home.   Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  We all have awful things happen to us in our lives.  I truly feel for her and hate that she has to go through all of that. I am impressed with how your family circled around her to care for her and their child/children.  I am shocked that she seems so ungrateful and childish.  Have a wonderful, safe trip with your husband and do not feel even the tiniest bit of guilt.  \ud83d\ude09", "NTA.

I don't actually think it's her grief causing her to do this, it's jealousy.  Not to be harsh, but if she wasn't living with your parents due to circumstances I daresay that SIL would possibly be considering or have already started dating again.  Unless she is planning to stay single for the rest of her life she will have the chance for a similar trip, just not now.  Just don't talk to them unless you absolutely have to until you get back from your romantic getaway with your husband.", "NTA - her expectations are unreasonable. \nThis story sounds similar to another I read where the wife told husband he couldn\u2019t come on a trip with her and his sister (that he had paid for) because SIL needed girls time and felt their friendship had been put aside (also friend since childhood) since she had got married. The wife was rightly called an A H for choosing SIL over husband - especially as he was paying fro the trip!  So yeah don\u2019t be that person. Go away with your husband, be firm and say you\u2019re sorry if that hurts her but you can\u2019t hide your relationship or prioritise her over your husband", "NTA: but honestly, even if I\u2019d just become a widow, I can\u2019t imagine trying to go on a \u201cromantic getaway\u201d with my best friend.

I would imagine part of this is that she would like to go to Paris and if she's been left with a mountain of debt, she can't afford to do that herself. Big dates like anniversaries and valentines etc are going to be emotionally difficult but they will be whether she has company or is in another country without her child. Furthermore she won't be on her own on valentines as she will be with your folks and her child (the child of her dead husband).", "it's awful that you lost your brother and SIL her husband, truly I'm sorry for your loss. with that said, are you, OP, supposed to never be happy in or celebrate your marriage again? lest you somehow \"rub your happy marriage\" in SIL face? that's... ridiculous. I get that misery loves company but you can't put everything on hold for her, she isn't your responsibility.\n\nI don't understand why your parents found it necessary to inform SIL about your trip. As you stated, this is a trip your HUSBAND paid for. I get that SIL is a grieving widow (and clearly needs to talk to a professional about these expectations she has) but respectfully, that isn't an excuse. Does she plan on paying your husband for half the trip since she's expecting to take his spot or does she want a free trip?\n\nAlso, in a world where you somehow did agree to go with her, are you supposed to be doing all these romantic activities (I assumed your husband planned stuff) with her? I just imagine her going and like, feeling worse? crying the whole time because she's still not over your brother (understandably) and you'd be left to comfort her and also not enjoy the trip.\n\nNTA. SIL needs therapy and your parents need to stop telling her things she doesn't need to know.", "NTA and she is grossly out of line. Yes it was an awful thing to happen for her, but she can\u2019t expect to make these demands of your life. I can\u2019t even with the guilt tripping and entitlement here!", "NTA. This is a trip planned with your husband . It's supposed to be a romantic getaway for the two of you. Plus, he should be with you when you tick something off your wish list. It is sweet that he is willing to step aside. But, would you even enjoy yourself without him? Do you want to have to emotionally babysit your SIL? \n\nNo hate for the SIL. She has been through one of the toughest things I can even imagine. But, she cannot use her tragedy as a weapon to get what she wants. There are also other things you guys could do together other than replace your husband for her on a trip. That was just an AH ask of her. I have a feeling that your family has been giving her whatever she wants. \n\nTell her sorry, but no. I am taking this trip with my husband. I can plan something for the two of us another time. Maybe have her pick some ideas out. Don't consider any ridiculous ones.", "W cf", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur husband is your partner .. of course you go to paris WITH HIM.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOur mom is an unreasonable AH, as is your SIL. Ignore their demands.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOU should not give up having a great relationship just because HER partner died.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTime to get some more distance with SIL and mom. And don't forgetto turn your phone off in paris, so they can not ruin your trip with their phonecalls.", "This is so unreasonable its laughable. Absolutely NTA", "Travel with your husband. SIL is out of line here, and so your parents.", "NTA and don\u2019t you dare give in to her demands. She sure is trying to milk her situation for all it\u2019s worth. This is childish, entitled behavior. She just wants you to be as miserable as she is. You are not responsible for making her feel better. And how does she expect the trip to be romantic anyway?", "NTA. Go to France with your husband. Not to sound harsh, but your brother died 2 years ago, not 2 months ago, you have every right to enjoy your marriage, it's manipulative of her to try and play the grieving widow card. Yes, everyone grieves differently and for different lengths of time. However, as far as mourning the loss of your brother because he was your brother before he was your husband a respectable amount of time has passed. You have every right to enjoy your life and marriage. If your parents feel so strongly about they can pay for her to take a trip somewhere, after all they are the ones who told her about the trip in the first place.", "NTA", "The entitlement to another couples vacation is actually hilarious.\n\nNTA and don\u2019t feel guilty for a second.", "Wtf? Your parents rubbed your happy marriage in her face. DO NOT TAKE SIL.", "Of course it's \"unfair.\" Life is unfair.\n\nWhat if (god forbid) OP is unable to have children? Should she be given her friend's child to make things \"fair\"?\n\nNTA OP. Go on the trip with your husband. Enjoy it without guilt. Let your mom take SIL to Paris if it's that important.", "I mean, Brittany's not wrong: it *isn't* fair that OP gets to enjoy a romantic getaway in Paris while she gets to enjoy a romantic getaway at the cemetery. Or, to be blunt: it's not fair that OP's husband is alive and hers is dead.\n\nBut the First Iron Law of Adulting is: *LIFE IS NOT FAIR, AND NOTHING YOU CAN DO WILL CHANGE THAT.* \n\nShe's entitled to feel sad and angry and cheated, because she was. But that doesn't entitled her to demand anyone else soothe those feelings, because they can't. Life isn't fair, and she needs to come to terms with that, with therapy if necessary.\n\nTL;DR: You are not bring married *at* her. NTA, but your parents are", "NTA. What?? That's incredibly manipulative and totally unfair. I get feeling sad that she'll never experience that with her husband, but asking your hubs to step aside from a gift he bought you and completely change your romantic getaway to an all-about-Brittany trip is just shockingly selfish. Daring to take a trip with your own husband is not \"rubbing your happy marriage in her face.\" It's been two years, and of course she's still grieving, but other people are allowed to live their lives. Her wording is just so emotionally charged, deliberately trying to make you feel bad.", "NTA\n\nBrittany has nothing to do with this. This is supposed to be a romantic trip between you and your husband. It's what normal people in relationships do. You are not obligated to put aside your time with your own husband to appease her. It's horrible she lost her husband in such a tragic way. You lost him too. But you should not be expected to put aside your happiness for her. Your husband paid for this trip with you. You did not run to you and tell her you are going on this trip. Your parents did. They are the ones to drive this wedge. How dare they put you in this horrible spot! \n\nMaybe offer to go on a trip with your SIL at another time. Maybe your parents can pay for it since they put you in this mess.", "NTA. You are not responsible for her tragedy and should be allowed to enjoy your gift from your husband without this guilt trip.\n\nAlso, I\u2019m really bothered by her comment that you and your husband \u201ccan just go another time.\u201d After the loss you both have suffered, she should realize that tomorrow is not promised.", "instant NTA. they are all very controlling. its nice your husband is willing to step down, but please dont do that. they will just take it as a sign that this type of behavior is acceptable.", "NTA. Even if you agreed to take her (which you absolutely should not), you're going to Paris. Over Valentine's Day. There'll be couples as far as the eye can see. Is she going to march up to every single one and demand they stop \"rubbing their relationship in her face\"? How does she honestly see herself coping surrounded by loved up couples?\nThe grief around losing a spouse is horrendous, but no one's obligated to pause their life for someone experiencing it.", "NTA.  Your parents need to stay out of it.  You can plan a trip with your SIL in the future.  You deserve this trip with your husband.  Tell your parents to back off.", "WTF? The world does not revolve around Brittany. You and your husband owe her nothing. And tell your mother, that you will not participate in the Brittany Show. She is being manipulative. I have been dealt a crap hand in life with a severely disabled child. My husband I have been out together alone about 10 times in 25 years. (Not even a weekend away) I would never guilt people in my family for enjoying themselves. NTA.", "I think OP's family's trying to punish op because Brittany is widow, not the other way and I hardly believe that Brittany would be able to go on a trip even if not widowed, since her late husband left her with debts(except if not medical, then not his fault). But either way no one could blame another couple that they are a couple and the most normal thing is doing something special together. In fact OP's family are f****** selfish b****\nNTA\n\nGo with your husband from your words he seems worth it to spend a time with", "NTA.  She said you could take your husband any time.  Well she is proof that is not true. Tomorrow is not promised.   What if this ended up being your last vacation with your husband and you took her instead?", "You are definitely NTA. It\u2019s really bizarre for Brittany to want you to ditch your husband to go on a romantic trip with her. I understand that she\u2019s probably still grieving but it\u2019s unreasonable for her to expect friends and family not to do things with partners because she is widowed. \n\nYour husband is nice for offering to step down, but I think you should go with him. You obviously want a romantic trip with him, and it\u2019s your gift after all. Also, I suspect that if you did take Brittany she\u2019d spend 2 weeks in Paris crying because she\u2019s there with you and not her husband. I think Brittany needs therapy, and I mean this in a kind way because she\u2019s obviously not coping.", "NTA. Girl no. Go with your husband.", "Wtf NTA. She has lost her mind. Don't engage. She needs therapy. Enjoy your trip with your hubby!", "NTA. I can\u2019t even understand the logic of your parents and your SIL. They need to play a more parental role in your SILs life and help her grieve in a healthy way instead of enabling unhealthy behavior. They need to watch their granddaughter while she seeks therapy.", "NTA. That is jaw droppingly unreasonable. I suspect she is in a really bad place mental health wise. Your parents enabling her is just going to make it worse.", "NTA\n\nyou didn\u2019t rub anything in any body\u2019s face. Your mom took it upon herself to share the info with Brittany, so your mom is responsible for the fallout.", "NTA - Why don't you talk to your husband about you and her going back to Paris or somewhere else at a different time and you guys would pay for it.  \n\nI completely understand being a single mother is rough and I can understand she is still grieving but that doesn't mean you have to placate to her.  You aren't rubbing your happy marriage in her face.  You are just living your life.", "No comments from OP. Guessing this might be fake.", "NTA. Your husband paid for a gift for you, and SIL has no business inserting herself in the middle of it and making it about her. I'm afraid your parents are being ridiculous claiming you're \"rubbing your happy marriage\" in her face - you're just being married!", "NTA. Tell them you mentioned it to her husband and he said if they kept insisting, he would go without you and take a friend.", "NTA go enjoy your trip with hubby", "NTA - she has had an awful time no doubt however her request is unreasonable. If it is possible could you offer an alternative? Like a trip elsewhere or if funds are tight she can come stay with you for a week for a change of scene?", "NTA\n\nWhile I understand she is grieving and in great pain, she is also being unbelievably selfish and manipulative at the same time. If she truly feels this way, she needs grief counseling. Not a trip to Paris. \n\nSaid trip would bring up more of her grief as she saw any happy couple together. So it would do her more harm than good anyways.\n\nThis is a romantic getaway between you and your husband. Perhaps eventually your sister-in-law will date and marry someone else in time. Then that man will take her on romantic getaways.\n\nI am shocked your mother took your sister-in-law's side here.", "Do not take Brittany.  Do not\n\nYour husband bought this to do a romantic trip with you. It is not just a trip. It is so much more. Do not spoil your relationship with your husband just because your SIL is upset she is widowed and wanted to do this. She may get the chance but why should you be deprived of your trip?\n\nIf you do this, what else will she guilt you in to?", "Uhhh NTA that\u2019s reaching critical levels of selfishness and entitlement \n\nThe world is full of happy marriages. Brittany will have to cope with that. \n\nLiving well is not rubbing anything in her face. It\u2019s simply existing. \n\nPlan a girls\u2019 weekend at a hotel to be gracious and make it clear you expect this to be dropped. \n\n\u201cYou made a great point about having a girl\u2019s trip. Let\u2019s plan a (wine tasting, visit to city, whatever) for March. Of course you know I cannot cancel an international couples trip; you and I both know that your request isn\u2019t possible and I understand you were motivated by some very strong feelings. I know that you understand this too. Let\u2019s plan for our trip.\u201d\n\nDoes she deserve that grace? Honestly not really. But do your best to nudge her into acknowledging how ridiculous her request was and give her an \u201cout\u201d.\n\nFor your mom? \u201cMom the best way we can support Brittany is to remind her that her life is still full of potential and she will find love again; we need to encourage her to know that things like a big trip isn\u2019t out of the cards for her. Can I trust you to help support her in that?\u201d", "INFO: was your brother the golden child?? \n\nNTA- either way I\u2019m just guessing he was. The fact your parents told you not to be happy in your marriage speaks volumes. Go to Paris with your husband and have a wonderful time! Your sil should be ashamed of herself. Not only for wanting to leave her 2 year old child for 2 weeks but for trying to guilt you and having your parents rally to help! I would maybe understand had it been a month since it happened but it\u2019s been 2 years! Time for her to get into therapy and fix herself.", "NTA wow Brittany is being so manipulative! Quite frankly so are your parents. They should all be ashamed.", "NTA. I'm sorry but you marriage is not a \"love affair\". She is way out of line. I get that grief and bringing up a child alone are not easy, but that is not an excuse for her to be selfish and extremely manipulative.\n\nAlso, don't bring her to any girls trip if she really is this manipulative. It would be like giving in and she will behave like this again.", "NTA, obviously. I would *almost* call your SIL an asshole if not for the face she clearly needs therapy. All the other comments are pretty much saying exactly what also think, but I don\u2019t think enough people are pointing out that she clearly needs to talk to a professional.", "NTA-tell your parents to take her to Paris then. Am I the only one that finds it kind of manipulative that she is guilting you like this? Raising your child isn\u2019t giving up anything-it\u2019s called handling your responsibilities as a parent-and in no way means she should be entitled to your VALENTINES trip with your husband.", "NTA. I'm surprised she didn't ask you to bow out and let your husband take her instead.\n\nYou aren't a substitute for your brother. Where's her family in all of this?\n\nShe still has plenty of years to find a partner and go on epic couples trips. Are your parents also feeding into the story that she can never move on from your brother?", "Excuse me?  How dare she even suggest that! That is for you and your husband and I doubt your mother would do the same.  Go on your romantic trip to Paris with your husband.  Tell Brittany to file bankruptcy to get rid of that debt.  You do not owe her anything because she was married to your brother.  I had a brother in law who tried to make demands of my time after my sister died.  I told him to get bent because he took advantage of me enough when my sister was alive.  I was not going to sacrifice money and my career to cart him around because he didn't have a car.  When he tried to get my mother on his side, she let him have it and tore him a new one.  Didn't work.  I feel for her, but no.  You have your own life and you are not responsible for hers.  Tell your parents to please have some common sense.  You are not flaunting your marriage in her face.  You are married.  You cannot hide it!  What is wrong with people!", "NTA\nYour relatives and Brittany need therapy urgently", "NTA I think Brittany has your whole family wrapped around her little grieving finger and has got so entitled to special widow treatment that she can\u2019t even understand how preposterous this request is. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. \nEnjoy the trip with your husband. Bon voyage!", "NTA. This is soooo strange. Go with your husband, and tell your parents to take her on a romantic trip to Paris. Wth?\n\nWhen did you become responsible for Brittany\u2019s feelings anyway?", "NTA this is so weird. \"We could just go another time\" yeah and so could she? The whole point is she can *never* go on a trip to Paris with her husband, so if all she wants now is a girls holiday with you if you wanted to you could both do that another time. There is literally no reason for her to hijack your holiday, and I don't understand how a girls trip will fulfil her desire for a romantic holiday with her dead husband anyway.", "It is bizarre that she made this request, and even more bizarre that your parents supported her side. Britney has some mental health stuff that goes beyond losing a spouse, she needs therapy. Your trip has nothing to do with her, you can travel with your husband anytime you want. It sounds like such a stressful thing to have to address, but this would be a good time to draw some boundaries. This probably isn\u2019t the first time she has had inappropriate boundaries with you. It scares me she is now dependent on your parents if this is her perspective. Hate to say it but it doesn\u2019t sound like she will ever leave their house and will expect everything done for her. And your parents will probably play right into it\u2026", "OP, you're not even considering this, right? She's out of line for asking. NTA.", "Wtf ya thats a big no from me. NTA not your monkey not your circus. No should have been enough. All that guilt tripping and crying. Tell your smother she can buy sil and take her on the romantic getaway if it's so important to her.", "Moreover your parents are the ones who told Brittany about the trip, not you. So how can they say you are rubbing it in her face ..\nTake a weekend with her to the spa if you want to but do not compromise about your Christmas gift. And tbh the fact she said you are punishing her for being a widow by going to Paris with your husband makes me think she is highly manipulative and/or she needs therapy rather than a trip. So perhaps you and your parents could pay for a therapy if you can aford it.", "This. When I read this I was like \"What did I just read?\" The entitlement is unreal. If your parents are so concerned for her valentines day experience, they should pay for her trip themselves, instead of trying to steal someone elses. NTA of course.\n\nEdit: judgement", "Why did these parents run and tell Brittany anyway? Can they not see they own child enjoying something with her husband? Is the op meant to live in misery because this woman is?", "Yeah NTA, clearly the family had a favorite child in law and it wasn't OP's husband.", "Yeah...that's really out there.... OP go enjoy your trip with hubby!!!!", "NTA\n\nSeems more like she's trying to punish you for being happily married.\n\nNot sure what your finances are like, but if you're so inclined, maybe start putting a little away to take her on a girl's trip in the future?

You don't get to take over other people's life moments because your own didn't work out.\n\nYou are not the AH, OP. I get that grief is crazy making, but it's not a free ticket to bullying people or using loss as a leverage. Stop letting these ridiculous people emotionally blackmail you.\n\nAnd also consider this - you're planning a lifetime romantic trip with your husband. Would you really not resent the hell out of your SIL forever if you cave and take her instead? Your dream romantic trip, now all about her? Are those the memories you want?", "> A trip to Paris is not cheap\n\nTook me a second to realise that the poster is in the US, and therefore Paris is a trans-atlantic trip not a quick weekend city break by train or budget airline \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut yeah, you're spot on with your comment. Life goes on regardless of what anyone wants. You can't ask others to put their happiness on hold for you, that's just unreasonable.", "This is definitely one of the more insane family posts I've read here. Clearly NTA, but then you're gonna get those comments saying OP is an AH for not automatically knowing they're in the right when they're stuck in the midst of absolute batshit crazy.

Also, I completely agree with every word you said", "I don't think OP needs to alter her travel arrangements, but she can - if she wants - ask her SIL to help her begin planning a trip for them.\n\nIt's hard to be a young widow with a 2-year-old. Holidays will be hard for a long time. It sounds like her life is difficult and it might take years for things to turn around given the debt situation.
