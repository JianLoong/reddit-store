As part of having a friendship with me, she was around my brother (M, would be 30) quite a lot as children, and their romance blossomed as teenagers. They were married five years ago.\n\nUnfortunately, my brother passed two years ago in a tragic accident and left behind a mountain of debt for Brittany. She was eight months pregnant at the time, and ended up moving in with my parents. Her and her daughter, Lilac (2F), live with my parents to this day, and the family alternate watching Lilac so Brittany can get her degree. Everyone has really rallied around Brittany in such a trying time.\n\nFor Christmas, my husband (M30) bought an all-inclusive trip for him and I to explore Paris and have a romantic getaway. I have always had France on my wish-list, and I am so grateful to him for such a wonderful gift. We leave in Feburary for two weeks, and it is honestly a dream come true.\n\nI told my parents about the gift, and they then told Brittany, who called me in floods of tears asking that I take her instead of my husband. She said that she will never be able to experience a romantic getaway like that with her own husband, and that we (my husband and I) could just go again at another time. She said she gave up everything to raise Lilac and she would love for us to have a girls' trip like we did when we were younger.\n\nI told Brittany that that was not possible, this was a gift from my husband to me and I fully expected to have a romantic getaway with him. Brittany told me that I was punishing her for being a widow, and that it was unfair I would have a 'love affair in Paris' while she cried at my brother's grave.\n\nMy husband thinks she is trying to make me feel guilty, but said he would step out of the trip if I would like to take Brittany. The thing is that I want to go with my husband, but my parents have since called to tell me that they would watch Lilac and that I should not rub my happy marriage in Brittany's face. My mom told me I would be selfish to leave a grieving widow over Valentines Day.

That's such an unreasonable request and frankly if that's the way she feels, she should be going for therapy.

Because after all, she doesn\u2019t have a husband anymore.\n\nI understand how difficult it has been for her. It\u2019s a very sad story. But you guys are doing all you can to help her. I can\u2019t even believe she would ask you to do that. I think she\u2019s wallowing in self-pity a little too much or maybe she\u2019s just not thinking clearly . But it was a ridiculous request and there\u2019s no way in hell you should honor it.\n\nYour parents should also know better.  I don\u2019t understand what they\u2019re thinking! A trip to Paris is not cheap. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re going to the local beach and you can afford to go there next year too. \n\nIt was a gift from your husband to you. Go with your husband and tell the rest of them that you should try to save for another trip and then you and her can go together maybe next year. \n\nyes, she lost her husband but you lost your brother.  i\u2019m sure you could use a little happiness in your life as well. Go to Paris. do not feel guilty. Enjoy the hell out of yourselves. The rest of them will get over it. If not, they\u2019re not very good friends/family.", "NTA\n\nTell your parents to take her and Lilac on a trip if they feel sorry for her.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a saint for asking, but this is a trip \\*he\\* paid for for \\*you and him.\\*  He's the one who gets to go.\n\nBrittany may have lost a partner, but you lost a brother. You need this time as much as she does.\n\nI'm sorry, but to quote Reba, the world doesn't stop for \\[her\\] broken heart.", "NTA. Your husband is right - Brittany is trying to make you feel guilty and is now working on your parents. What guarantee do you have that you and your husband could go again at another time? She lost her husband in an accident and must realise that you never know what might happen. Brittany is only 28 - it's possible that she will meet someone else, remarry, and have her own Paris love affair. Go with your husband and enjoy every minute.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nWhat happened to her is unfortunate and no one should have to experience that. But you can not stop living your life because she is a widow. You had your brother taken away from you so no one can argue that you don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going through or anything like that. \n\nBeing a widow does not entitle you to a trip to Paris for two weeks.", "NTA\n\nGo with your husband.

I\u2019m sorry for you and your family\u2019s loss. It sounds like it\u2019s been a hard couple of years for you all and of course Brittany. HOWEVER, this has no connection to your husband wanting to take you away on a dream trip. It\u2019s quite worrying how manipulative both Brittany and your family seem to be about this situation. Go on the trip with your husband. It was a gift he bought for you to enjoy together. If you really want to compromise I suggest moving the trip from around Valentine\u2019s Day and offer to spend Valentine\u2019s with her. I can also confidently say having been to Paris on Valentine\u2019s Day you\u2019re not losing much. Paris is pretty romantic all year around.", "NTA. She has no right to hijack your damn trip.", "NTA. I often read these posts and wonder what the hell the extended family are thinking. Obviously it\u2019s tragic brittany lost her husband, but you lost your brother too so let\u2019s not forget that. I can\u2019t believe the entitlement expecting you to take her on holiday it\u2019s just wild", "NTA\n\nIt is tragic that she lost her husband and you lost your brother. But that does not mean that you are never allowed to enjoy your marriage. \n\nI'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say that her grief is making her see things in a strange way but you are allowed to be happy. Your happiness isn't rubbing anything in anyone's face.\n\nGo on the trip with your husband. Enjoy yourself. Don't let anyone make you feel guilty. \n\nAnd if your parents try to make you feel bad, tell them that you'd happily accept it if they paid for you and Brittany to take a girl's trip at a later date.", "NTA! This your trip with your husband!   You need to stand your ground.  Go and dont look back , if your family hold this over your head then they are   not worth having in  your life.", "NTA\n\nGo and enjoy your trip. I'm sorry she is miserable, and it's understandable, but that shouldn't prevent you from living your life.\n\nYou're not rubbing your happy marriage in her face. What does she expect - that you should pretend your marriage sucks?\n\nAlso, what she may or may not realise is that going to Paris is with you is not what she wants. What she really wants is to go to Paris with her late husband. Since that is impossible, it seems she wants to prevent you from enjoying the things she can't.\n\nThe reality is that you can support her in her grief but you can't take responsibility for her.", "NTA at all !! I am so sorry for the death of her husband but it doesn\u2019t give her any right to be entitled to you. She sounds like she is still grieving and she should definitely work through that with a therapist at least. Your parents are the assholes for asking you to give up something you always wanted to do and they sound very much entitled!! Why don\u2019t they take her to Paris if they\u2019re so worried then", "No. She had no concerns about being a lonely widow  on Valentine's day until she heard about your trip. \n\nI get it must be hard for her. Seeing people with their loved ones while she ost hers. It's probably tough, but most people would try to be excited for you and push the jealous and sad feelings aside, because she is your friend and should be happy that you DO have this romantic trip that will be wonderful. it's unreasonable to ask you to sacrifice yours because she is alone. \n\nI would instead plan a girls trip another time. But my gosh... I honestly don't think I'd want to go.", "NTA. Absolutely feel for you, your family and your SIL but I think your SIL has gotten a bit spoiled over the years.

What happened to her is tragic and I\u2019m so sorry for all of your losses but this is a special trip between you and your husband and I\u2019m honestly so blown away she invited herself tried to guilt trip you and the family is okay with this? Absolutely do not take her, do not do this to your husband or yourself, you go with your husband and have a good time. I\u2019m honestly like flabbergasted she tried to guilt trip you like that, like you are allowed to be happy in your marriage and do all the amazing fun things and you should! She needs a lot of therapy but she doesn\u2019t need to hijack your trip and if she went to therapy I\u2019m sure they would tell her the same thing.

If something good happens to you, will she always react like that? Inserting herself onto your life and have this weird expectation from you.\n\nNow is the time to set clear boundaries.", "NTA... And what kind of request is that? In what world would she think asking you to ditch your husband, who gave you the trip, is OK? Who does that lol\nEnjoy your trip with your husband and leave the guilt tripping at home.", "NTA Brittany is delusional. Girl go on your trip with your husband, and have fun.", "NTA and for goodness sake do NOT change anything!\n\nYour husband planned and paid for a wonderful romantic break for the pair of you - which includes Valentines Day.  If your mother is such a stirring control freak to tell you that it would be selfish point out to her that she and your dad could take Brittany on a trip.", "NTA. As harsh as it may sound, the whole point of a romantic getaway is the romance. You won't get that with your SIL. Instead you'll spend two weeks listening to her wishing how her husband/your brother was there to share it with her, especially if it falls during Valentine's. You will both spend the entire trip miserable.\n\nIt's all well and good saying that your husband and you can go on another trip some other time, but if your brother's passing proves anything its that life is too short to not spend time with your loved ones and make memories while you can.\n\nIf she's that adamant that you two have a girl's trip together suggest that the two of you go on a spa weekend. Somewhere closer to home, less expensive, and at a less emotionally wrought time of the year.", "NTA   They are all now gaslighting the hell out of you.  This is a gift from your hubs specifically for  you both and is important for that alone.  You are not responsible for how Brittany's feelings.  A good friend would never even THINK to ask you for that type of sacrifice.  As she well knows, life isn't fair or predictable and she's willing to rob you of good memories with your husband?   Just gross for your parent's to hop in on this as well.", "NTA.\nIt's understandable that she wishes it could be her, but it's not. Being a good friend means listening to that, being sensitive about how much she wants to hear about your trip and COULD mean planning a different trip together later on. But it doesn't mean rejecting the gift in the form your husband gave it to you. \nAlso, much as I sympathize with her pain, it's not like she will ever get to experience romance again (unless she chooses not to).", "Nope nope nope NTA. \n\nYou have been a good friend, you have been watching over your neice .\n\nDon't let Brittany bully you out of this trip. Don't let your parents bully you into not sharing this memory with your husband. \n\nGo on this trip and enjoy being together.  I am sure your brother would have wanted it this way.\n\nI wish you a wonderful trip", "NTA- what the hell??? All my condolences to Brittany but why should your husband's gift go to her?\nNo way. \nShe's emotionally blackmailing you and using her dead husband to do it. She's being very manipulative and I am shocked your parents don't see it how inappropriate she is being. \n\nThis is your Christmas present for your husband.

Do not change your trip.", "INFO: What if you stay with Brittany and I go with your husband? I'm a straight guy, so only minimal sex will be had between us.", "NTA\n\nSIL is absolutely out of line. The audacity!", "Nta. Do not do this op. Go with your husband.", "NTA.  Her widow status doesn\u2019t grant her free vacations at your expense.

I don't know what level of spare money you have but whether you could suggest you and her going away another time somewhere else?", "NTA AS A WIDOW MYSELF NTA she is weaponizing her grief. I get it\u2026 I so get it but life has to go on. That was the hardest thing for me was getting up each day and seeing my husbands face looking back at me with his blue eyes that dominate my daughters face. He passed on her 15th birthday and I had to get through each day to be her mom. I cried at the slightest smell that reminded me of him or a song we loved. But the thing is, my grief should not take away from my daughters grief and well being or my responsibility to that. Just like her grief should not take away from the grief of losing your brother nor should it take precedence over your love and you life with your husband. Do not give into this please you should not be made to feel guilty unless you INTENTIONALLY rub your life in her face.

Also if she thinks that she gave up everything for raising a child why did she have one? Not only that she should have been more vigilant about home finances if her husband/your brother was that bad with it to have so much debt.\n\nBut instead of thinking her life is over she should find happiness in everyday things and know that yes now is hard and it may seem like the storm will never pass but there is sun and it will shine on her again. And just because she has a child and she had one marriage doesn't mean she will not find someone in the future to go on a vacation. Time heal and make everything easier.", "NTA, stop telling people your business if it doesn't directly effect them!!", "F$ck no. \n\nGo with your hubby and ignore these people.", "NTA \n\nShe needs to be in therapy not on vacation. Your marriage has absolutely nothing to do with her. Your parents are just as ridiculous as she is. Tell them no and go on your trip just don\u2019t bring it up after you tell them no. Nip this in the bud now before she feels she can guilt trip you into other things.", "NTA\n\nDo not put Brittany feelings above the feelings of your husband, who planned the perfect romantic gift for his wife. That would be so unfair on him and a strain on your marriage for always putting your family first.\n\nThen tell your parents that their comments are grossly unfair and that the losing your brother shows how short life is. You could lose your husband the day after the trip and never get that time back. You love and support Brittany and your niece, but you refuse to stop living a married life because she is still (rightfully) grieving. You will support her with a trip later in the year - maybe over her wedding anniversary to make a horrible time a little easier (make your parents chip in for Brittany) but you won't lose memories on a romantic trip so lovingly planned by your husband. I would personally tell them how disappointed you are in their treatment of you, that Brittany has the right to feel how she feels, but they shouldn't attempt to shame you into not living a happy married life, parents should want that for their children.", "What the hell kind of entitled manipulation is happening here? Do not UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES take her on your trip!!!!!! NTA. I cannot believe the absolute nerve of some people.", "NTA\n\n>Brittany told me that I was punishing her for being a widow, and that it was unfair I would have a 'love affair in Paris' while she cried at my brother's grave.\n\nBrittany is in serious need of therapy. You're not at all punishing her or rubbing your marriage her face; you're simply going on a romantic trip with your husband for two weeks. This has absolutely nothing to do with her or your parents - who, by the way, need to reel their necks in and sit down.\n\nShe also needs to show some respect for the fact that her late husband was your brother, too, and that she isn't the only one who is grieving his passing. I imagine a part of why your husband planned this trip is to give you a break from the last two years and provide a distraction from your loss for a while. You're allowed to want to do something nice for yourself without guilt or pressure to give in to Brittany's demands just because she's widowed. Also, it would be extremely rude and unfair on your husband to expect him to be happy to change the nature of his gift to something he would no longer be a part of but still have funded. If Brittany is so desperate to go away with you, then you can plan it together and she can stump up her share of the costs.\n\nEDIT: Somehow I managed to miss this.\n\n>My husband thinks she is trying to make me feel guilty, but said he would step out of the trip if I would like to take Brittany.\n\nI can't decide if your husband is being generous or stupid for saying this, but you should absolutely, 100%, **NOT** take him up on it. If you give in to Brittany now, it'll open the door for her to make further unreasonable demands and you risk never being able to do anything again with your husband without her heaping on the guilt and jeopardising you. \n\nBuild those boundaries tall and strong, OP. Do not give in.", "NTA, absolutely you should not sacrifice your trip with your husband. Your SIL is guilt tripping you to a degree that she should be ashamed of herself.", "This request is in no way reasonable.  The logic doesn\u2019t even stack up.  Have there been other instances where she has used her grief to try and manipulate you or your parents? What happened in an absolute tragedy, for her and your entire family.  That doesn\u2019t entitle her to free vacations paid for by your husband.  She needs therapy ASAP, this isn\u2019t normal, but grief does very strange things to a person.  Either that or she\u2019s getting entirely too comfortable/becoming entitled to your assistance.  You would be doing your husband a disservice by taking her instead of him. NTA.", "SO clearly NTA!!  PLEASE do not give up such a beautiful gift from your husband for this woman who is exhibiting such spoiled, ridiculous behavior.  I have sympathy for her situation and it is so unfair that she lost your brother and has to raise the child alone.  However, your family has gone above and beyond to help her.  Even the fact that she felt ok about even calling to ask is just mind blowing to me.  I have to wonder if her parents just told her she was amazing all the time and never, ever told her the word \u201cno\u201d.  I would bet money on it.  If you do decide to take her, it will absolutely have a negative effect on your marriage.  I can just about promise that.  If your husband was kind enough to offer, it will cause him to wonder how much you are truly committed to him.  Show her these responses and explain that this is one of those times that she has stepped right out of her lane and that not only would you NEVER consider something so ludicrous, she needs to evaluate why she ever thought it would be ok to ask something so huge that she did not deserve, earn or have anything to do with SIMPLY because she wanted it. And from all you have said, that is truly the only reason she could ever have to back up her request.  Following her logic. I could go ask the family of one of my best friends who passed suddenly to just give me his truck or home.   Most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.  We all have awful things happen to us in our lives.  I truly feel for her and hate that she has to go through all of that. I am impressed with how your family circled around her to care for her and their child/children.  I am shocked that she seems so ungrateful and childish.  Have a wonderful, safe trip with your husband and do not feel even the tiniest bit of guilt.  \ud83d\ude09", "NTA.

I don't actually think it's her grief causing her to do this, it's jealousy.  Not to be harsh, but if she wasn't living with your parents due to circumstances I daresay that SIL would possibly be considering or have already started dating again.  Unless she is planning to stay single for the rest of her life she will have the chance for a similar trip, just not now.  Just don't talk to them unless you absolutely have to until you get back from your romantic getaway with your husband.", "NTA - her expectations are unreasonable. \nThis story sounds similar to another I read where the wife told husband he couldn\u2019t come on a trip with her and his sister (that he had paid for) because SIL needed girls time and felt their friendship had been put aside (also friend since childhood) since she had got married. The wife was rightly called an A H for choosing SIL over husband - especially as he was paying fro the trip!  So yeah don\u2019t be that person. Go away with your husband, be firm and say you\u2019re sorry if that hurts her but you can\u2019t hide your relationship or prioritise her over your husband", "NTA: but honestly, even if I\u2019d just become a widow, I can\u2019t imagine trying to go on a \u201cromantic getaway\u201d with my best friend.

Being widowed, though harsh and not something that you would want anyone to go through, does not give her the right to take your husband's place on a romantic trip. \nSay no, go and enjoy the memory making. \n\nAnyone who has a problem can sponsor a vacation for her and take her with them.", "Nta and please don\u2019t do that with your husband, it\u2019s a sad situation that your brother died but that don\u2019t mean you have to feel guilty about yourself enjoying good things\u2026.be the adult and don\u2019t enable your SIL because who knows what she is gonna ask in the future\u2026\nAbout her, you can\u2019t control what happens in your life but given the situation she is getting all the help she needs, asking for more it\u2019s unacceptable\u2026\nIf your parents think she deserves a trip, they can pay for it, but expecting your husband to deprive himself for other people it\u2019s awful\u2026\nProbably this will damage the relationship either way, one because if you travel with you will not be enjoying all the trip and if she didn\u2019t go she will blame you about something that wasn\u2019t hers first..\nSo go and enjoy the trip with the husband, if she treats you bad than maybe go LC for sometime", "What an asinine reason! So because Brittany is an unhappy widow, you are also doomed to not have an enjoyable marriage? When can you have a happy marriage - after Brittany finds love again? And if, god forbid, your marriage gets affected, will your family be okay with it? You and your husband deserve to be happy. If your family is ruining that, time to step away from them and save your marriage.\nYou don't need to support your brother's widow at the cost of your own marriage.\nNTA.", "YTA to your husband. Why is this even an issue. Why did you even brought it up to him. I would've laughed and hang up the phone as your SIL is way out of place and acting like it's a normal and logic thing to ask for a husband to give up his gift? \nSet boundaries with your family as it's going to keep happening and it's 100% going to affect your children; wonder what are your children going to give up just because Lilac can't also have it. I can assure you this will go on forever and she will turn your parents into her favor because of grief. \nTell her and your parents a firm no and ask them not to bring it up again since it's something not negotiable and never has been. \nReassure your husband that you want to go with him and start making plans.", "Rightly said. OP should take her husband with her, putting aside all that was said to shame her.", "I had a similar thought, WTF is wrong with these people? It\u2019s like the post about the girl who\u2019s family had a go at her because her GF gave her a cake on her birthday and posted a picture on Insta saying happy birthday just cause her birthday was the day her nephew? passed away\n\nWhy do some people think everyone else should stop celebrating because they lost someone (I do mean after the grieving period)", "That's what I thought too! Why does she think that she'll never have a partner again and will never go on a holiday again? If she finds a new husband, will she dump him to go with OP or her husband instead?\n\nWhy does everyone expect the lives of other people to stop due to someone grieving, and why does the grief of OP count less?\n\nThis is a heartless family and OP should have a stern talk to all of them and shut them down once and for all.", "Yeah but it's like she also expects that OP would pay for the vacation. So I don't think it's a good idea to go with SO.", "i know right!?!   it would never even occur to me to ask that! It just seems so crazy to me"]}
