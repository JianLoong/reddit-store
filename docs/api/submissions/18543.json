I don't even share a tent overnight with a sibling.", "Then you should have found a vacation home with 5 rooms.", "There's three rooms though. Mom and daughter can share one, Dad and youngest son can share one and the two older sons can share one. Why is it that only the sons are being inconvenienced?", "Why? What kind of twisted brothers do you know?", "Why not?", "> The female gets her own room because she should NOT share a room with older males!\n\nThey're her brothers though, not random strangers...", "> The root issue is that the vacation house is too small to accommodate everyone, and that 2 sons are paying for the opportunity to have 3 people to a room.\n\n,,,\n\nDo you think the second son didn't know that would happen BEFORE agreeing to go?\nHe was happy to go, he wasn't happy to pay for his flight to get there.\n\nSomeone was going to have to share, he was just salty it was him.", "He was free to do that", "He makes it clear in another comment they\u2019re not paying him for the accommodations, they\u2019re chipping in for food, activities and transportation (don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a flight or if it\u2019s just gas money). So his wording actually made it sound way worse than it is. \n\nI still don\u2019t get why the two youngest can\u2019t share a room, but that\u2019s kinda a separate issue.", "Food, transportation, activities", "He has a part time job. he is in college", "This situation as it stands is just doomed to not have a happy ending because of size. \n\nEither people who have paid to be there are going to be smushed into a room, or a teenage girl who is used to her own room and space will have quite the culture shock. Neither is ideal. \n\nI think getting a hotel on the parents dime might be the easiest way to try and fix the situation though. The adult sons are already paying for travel (which may include airfare\u2026 unclear) so asking for more money out of them is just cruel at this point.", "Man you are all so entitled. Did you all grow up rich? Maaan. Not vacations, try everyday thay I/friends/family slept on shared rooms. As far as vacations are concerned shared rooms is the norm. Money is tight. Shared tents when we could afford no room.", "Right after I found a money tree", "Per the OP, as it was listed as a second issue I absolutely believe that this may have not been communicated at the start.", "You're the parent. You plan things out. You should have already factored that in instead of defaulting on such a stupid idea.", "So the college student with a part time job had to pay to go on a vacation where he had to share a room with two other people while his sister paid nothing and had her own room ? \n\nYour kids are siblings. Two in each room would have been a lot more fair.\n\nAt this point, I don't see how you can keep up with family vacations that way.", "Reading my comment its different to be southern European i guess. Much more cool with trivial stuff like this, much more poor also", "Ah so you made them pay for their part to a vacation home you own? I thought you rented it for the vacation, well now that's even worse.", "I thought you did...with 1 st and 2 nd kids /s", "He didn't pay when he was a minor either", "You say it like he was supposed to", "Child labour is illegal bro", "I said it like that commentor said my minor daughter didn't pay."]}
