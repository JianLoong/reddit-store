If you really need an escape from the sadness of the current situation, and are willing to take the risk that he might die while you are there, then you should be fully honest with your family about that.

I don't judge anyone who needs a break from that. It's a few hours, peek at your phone every so often if you are worried and you can duck out of the theater if someone calls. \n\nAs far as missing his death: every time I have sat with a loved one the nurses have come and told us that some people wait to go when they are alone. We have always made sure the dying person had some privacy at least once in a while in case this happened. My mom and I stayed with my grandma all day and night with her barely clinging to life and she didn't pass until we finally left to go eat. We got a call literally 10 minutes after we left.

Do not put this child in the middle so you can try to get what you want.\n\nThere's a difference between grieving your way, and trying to involve another person.

What's the material difference between doing that at a movie or by going for a walk?\n\nGive him some grace.

Heck while Mum was looking after Dad, the resident chaplain gave me a lift home to get some stuff I needed (periods have really inconvenient timing!) and talked to me about guilt - he pointed out that it's ok to take a breather for your own mental health, and by doing so, you can be better able to look after everyone else in turn. No-one is helped by burning yourself out in emotional martyrdom.\n\nSitting by someone's deathbed can be a long, exhausting and stressful marathon.

Offer to take your niece out to give your sister a break. See if there's something else you can do for the other members of your family. Take the time to refresh yourself mentally. Offer others the time to do that do if possible. Come back and bring everyone your renewed strength and love. You all need it. And I wish your family a peaceful and loving end. \n\n(And then please, take the time to breathe again and be together with your family. When my dad died, the first thing Mum, my sister and I did was go to a nearby restaurant and get the first proper meal we'd had in days. Hospices/hospitals are full of lovely people, but they aren't hotels and we'd been eating nothing but sandwiches for days! From an outside point of view, I'm sure that sounds weird or unloving, but it was the opposite - we bonded as a trio, we remembered Dad as he had lived, we were thankful that he wasn't suffering any longer...we even laughed.)", "Watching movies help me relax.", "He's very un-responsive.

He took me to see Jurassic Park (the late showing) when I was like 9 or 10.", "I gained absolutely nothing by being in the same room with my parents when each of them died. OP has been grieving for a while as his dad is dying from cancer. I grieved 7 years for my dad before he even passed away. Terminal pulmonary fibrosis, and he refused to even consider a heart lung transplant. I had a better time with the grief for my grandmother because I didn't even go to the hospital, a 16-hour drive to another state. I stayed home and remembered her visit the summer before, not her delirious in the hospital accusing her son of getting her pregnant. \n\nIn the softest way possible, I'm going to tell you that you're projecting your own grief and regret on OP.", "You just described what I asked. \n\nHe's not getting better. His cancer has spread too far.", "Uh...when my mum was in the hospital for the last time my brother and I took shifts so she was never alone for longer than it took one of us to go to the washroom or the cafeteria. We slept in a chair by her bed. We did this for five weeks. My brother had a job as well.\n\nA friend with two siblings, with both siblings having jobs, managed the same thing for *ten* weeks. \n\nSo it is possible, and done in some families, to spend a lot of time with a dying person, if they\u2019re conscious and scared. Lots of people put their lives on hold for this.\n\nThat said, if OP feels the movie would help their mental state, I can see why they\u2019d want to go. It won\u2019t make a difference to their dad as he won\u2019t know who\u2019s in the room. As long as *somebody* is there so the family doesn\u2019t suffer from thinking he died alone...\n\nThe problem would arise if he dies while OP is in the theatre. OP would receive a call from the family - either they will have their phone turned off, which will upset the rest of the family, or they will answer it and upset the rest of the theatre. I think they\u2019d be risking a rift with the rest of the family over this.\n\nYou\u2019d think well, it would be a text, not a phone call, but in my experience, no matter how often people normally text and how seldom people actually phone, this news doesn\u2019t get texted, it\u2019s a phone call. Upset people just can\u2019t bring themselves to type it out.\n\nOP, I\u2019m sorry about your dad. I\u2019ve been through this with parents, in-laws, and close friends, and it just absolutely completely sucks. I understand that at this stage your presence won\u2019t make a difference to your dad. If you think you not being with your dad at the last won\u2019t upset your family, then it\u2019s ok to go - but I don\u2019t think you do feel that, as you\u2019re considering taking your niece as an excuse. \n\nNTA but I think you\u2019d be better off waiting.", "but he didnt say he wanted to rest and recover energy.
