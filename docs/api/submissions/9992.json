It takes an awful lot of entitlement to invite other people to a wedding that isn\u2019t yours.  I\u2019ll never understand that thought process, outside of cultures where there is a kind of prestige/honor thing about inviting everyone you know.\n\nYou set up the wedding you wanted.

Tell your mom that she does not have any business issuing invitations to your wedding, no matter how small or casual it is. Tell the preacher she is not invited to your wedding and she can go hold the baby at another time.", "NTA. You have every right to control the guest list to your wedding. Especially a small, intimate ceremony. Getting second hand info that someone is crashing it for such a silly reason is completely overboard. The next time your mom claims you're being selfish, just tell her \"Yes, I am. You know why? Because it is my wedding!\" Not the bridezilla, just normal expectations.", "NTA.

Start with the ordained person and ask about the baby, explain the situation and that you absolutely do not want anyone else to attend.

When we eloped, we used a kind of wedding license that's in place because of Quakers, who don't really have ministers the same way other denominations do.  The parties getting married marry *themselves* to each other.  All it requires is them plus witnesses.  That's what we did, just ourselves and a pair of witnesses.\n\nI've since been a witness for two other couples doing the same thing.\n\nIt's not available everywhere (we're in Pennsylvania), but it might be worth looking into if you want to avoid the whole \"ordained minister\" thing like we did.", "NTA.

She feels embarrassed to have to tell her preacher that she made a mistake in doing so, but the preacher will understand, because it's not normal for people to bring uninvited guests. If the minister you're using and this preacher are from the same church, I think you'd be right to reach out to both and ask if the officiant you've chosen is planning to bring a baby(because that's also not a normal behavior and its fine to want someone else to do it if this is the scenario) and to tell the other that you're sorry but your mother overstepped by inviting her. I realize your mother should fix this, but since she seems more inclined to guilt trip you into doing something you don't want, it's probably best to take care of it yourself.", "NTA. Is your mom in a relationship with the preacher?", "People can get ordained on the internet. You can hire someone that isn't from your mom's church or get a friend to marry you two.

She is being pretty rude inviting someone to YOUR wedding.  And then being manipulative when she isn\u2019t getting her way.  Please don\u2019t back down.

Your mom stuck her nose in and now it's being cut off. Her problem.", "NTA. I can't help but reiterate what others have said, it's your wedding. This is your day, therefore your choice. Tell your mom to back off. She CAN uninvited her preacher, she's just too embarrassed to admit her entitled mistake. I saw in another comment you mention your mom saying something about not knowing what it's like to lose a parent...tell her that you're about to find out because she's pushing the boundary line to the point that you WILL cut off contact with her, and she won't have any part in your life anymore especially if children enter the picture therefore essentially you losing a parent. The threat of not being able to see any potential grandchildren may make her shut up and back off faster than a speeding bunny on too much caffeine. If she doubles down however, you might want to be ready to pull a last minute switch that only you, your fiancee, the minister marrying you, and your future MIL know about. It can be something as simple as moving from morning to afternoon, or the day before or after. The switch doesn't have to be drastic, but enough that your mom (and her oh so favorite preacher) will end up missing it due to the wrong time/day. You could also go the route of a true elopement, telling your future MIL that you are sorry but the ceremony is off thanks to your own mother being an entitled brat, and just marry with the minister whenever you are ready. If there is a need for witnesses, you might be able to get one or two friends to be there right quick (not unusual to need witnesses for the license to be considered legal). Talk it over with your fiancee and come up with ideas or plans depending on how conversations with your mother go.", "NTA, but what you are doing is not eloping. \n\nElope: run away secretly in order to get married, especially without parental consent.\n\nI would suggest you go ahead and elope for real.

She was mad I didn\u2019t want to go in person to dress shop, and said I was ruining everything about the experience. (Huh.. it\u2019s my soon to be day?)
