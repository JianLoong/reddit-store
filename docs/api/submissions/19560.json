My wife (51F) and I have raised her, on and off, in our home from the time she born until she was a toddler and steadily ever since.  Anna's mother(31F), my oldest step-daughter, had her when she was 17 and simply doesn't have the \"parent\" gene or skill. Anna's father, also a teen at the time, never claimed Anna and has since died of a drug overdose. We are her legal guardians for many reasons and never did the legal adoption for many other reasons.\n\nI have been Anna's primary caretaker since she came to us as a toddler. I rearranged my schedule to be home with her, eventually becoming a full-time work-at-home employee to that end. My wife even left our home to spend three years living with Anna's mother trying to get her stable. During that time, Anna lived with me and I was, essentially, a single dad. My wife would come over at least once a weekend to take Anna to visit her mother or the occasional overnight at her mother's place with the three of them. Anna and her mother are not really able to be together more than a couple of hours alone without something going on.\n\nNeedless to say, Anna and I bonded to the father/daughter roles and that's how I see her and that's how she sees me. My family has accepted her fully as a member of my family and my children(31F, 28M, 26F) all consider Anna their little sister and treat her as such. My wife's family sees Anna in her traditional role (granddaughter/niece). Anna and I, both, recognize the informality of our relationship and shuck and jive depending on which side of the family we are interacting with.\n\nAnna has decided that she wants to add my last name \"Smith\" to her last name \"Jones\" to become Anna Jones-Smith. That... uhh... caused some strife on the Jones side, including my wife who is a \\[wife's maiden name\\]-Smith. The Jones side, which to be honest can't stand me, and my wife have accused me of brainwashing Anna and secretly forcing her to say that because I have, admittedly, said that while she is biologically a Jones, that she is every bit a Smith and accepted as a Smith by the Smiths as if she were sharing the DNA.\n\nAITA for making sure Anna is accepted and made every bit a part of my side of the family as her biological side to the point Anna wants to add my name to hers?", "created_utc": 1686498142, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146x4xm/aita_because_my_stepgranddaughter_wants_to_change/", "score": 58, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is old enough to realize who has been there and who hasn't.", "NTA you did nothing wrong and changed your life for someone else\u2019s child. That child currently is considering changing her name and adding yours as a tribute to you and your sacrifices. The only thing that would change my answer is if you asked her to or suggested she does, otherwise there is nothing bad about this situation. \n\nThe mother who wasn\u2019t there and the grandmother who chose her daughter instead of her granddaughter should have no say on this one sorry not sorry.", "NTA She may change her mind but it's her name.", "NTA. She is proud of her family (you) and wants to legally show that to the world. You did a good job parenting, be proud of her, and the rest of the haters can f off. Nobody else's opinion matters. They will always be upset about something, so keep doing you and try not to let it get to you!", "An 18 YO is an adult. She can change her name if she wants. If you've done all you say,  it makes sense that she would want to add your name.  NTA", "NTA. It is even not your decision. Hopefully she will be strong enough to stand up for her self and you when she turns 18. What worries me is that your wife is against you in this. Her family - ok, they have their own agenda, but she should stand with you. If the relationship between you and Anna is such a wonderful father-daughter bond as you described it (I\u2019m sure it is), your wife should be happy as he*l and applaud that Anna is such a good girl, even though her bio mother couldn\u2019t take care of her.", "For the question you ask, NTA\n\nWithout any other info, I can see her biological side being upset.  BUT ....... when she turns 18 she can all herself Smith-Jones-Crabcake if she wants and legally change it so.  Also, where were they when she was a toddler in need of a home?\n\nYour concern seems to be the other side thinks you are brainwashing her.  Its not that they do or do not have a leg to stand on but this is not a fight to have right now with a 14 year old in the middle.  Just drop the whole thing, tell Anna to drop it and you guys can discuss it at a later date.", "NTA-you are a good father, props to you for stepping up and props to your daughter for acknowledging your role.  You both sound lovely.  If her bio-family family has issues, they can kick rocks.", "NTA. Imagine being angry at someone receiving appreciation from a child they raised. Everybody who complains about this is an asshole.", "NTA. You are a great grandfather and Anna is lucky to have you. It's a huge compliment that Anna thinks so highly of you and considers you to be her real parent. Tell anyone who questions it that it is Anna's choice and that's the end of the discussion.", "NTA\n\nDont feel bad that you did a good job at raising your daughter.", "NTA. Family is not just by blood.", "NTA you didn't do anything wrong they can go ride a bike!", "Omg, how beautiful is that. \n\nI had a slightly different experience to what you describe. It's a long story that still doesn't make sense to me at 40, but I was raised with just my step-fathers name, even though that wasn't my legal name. My sperm donor (not an actual sperm donor, but really all he contributed to the situation) wasn't in the picture, but I still had a good relationship with his parents and brother. My step dad, who was there from when I was 14months, was a wonderful father and I consider him, and call him dad, but never legally adopted me. When I found out accidentally at 15, I should legally be double barreled, I started using my 'official' double barreled name. Because both of these people made me me, neither is more important than the other, and I feel like if I dropped either I would dishonor the family I dropped. I am proud to carry both names, keeping both of them part of me. I suspect Anna feels the same. She feels it's important that all sides of her are represented in how she presents to the world as an adult and she wants to carry your name as well as her bio name. This is her way of marking herself 'officially' part of your family, and recognising the massive part you have played in her life. Just beautiful.\n\nTotally NTA. And don't fret, please just embrace Anna and whatever she feels is right for her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
