Yes. Bovine tuberculosis can infect humans and the most common route of infection is from drinking (oral) raw (unpasteurized) milk or eating dairy products made from raw milk. Less commonly, the bacteria can enter the body by breathing in (aerosol) or through breaks in the skin (direct contact). [https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/bovine\\_tuberculosis\\_F.pdf](https://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/FastFacts/pdfs/bovine_tuberculosis_F.pdf)\n\nPasteurization, a low-temperature, long-time process, was first developed to kill the tuberculosis pathogen. By 1917, it was mandatory for milk. After that, the incidence of tuberculosis contracted from milk fell dramatically. Non-pulmonary TB disappeared.

I\u2019m allowed to, if I wish, drink their milk raw. I\u2019m simply not allowed to sell it for human consumption. I am, however, allowed to sell it for animal consumption. For example, I\u2019ve been asked to sell to local vets having to hand raise baby animals. I don\u2019t usually drink milk at all, but I\u2019m obsessed with cheese, and that\u2019s how I use the milk. Anyway, as you said, you\u2019re only harming yourself.

Advice is appreciated, but dont expect me to take it and get mad at me if i dont. I will not act upon your preferences for my body", "NTA\n\nIts none of her business what you choose to eat or drink.

In the countries where milk in the stores in not pasteurized, people boil milk at home in a special milk-boiler (it makes it not form the weird film on top and lets it keep the taste) before consumption. So raw milk is sold, but only idiots choose to consume it raw.  \n\n\nSource: lived in such a country.", "As well as apple cider.", "I really do understand that there are risks associated with consuming any kind of raw food, especially raw milk, and that pasteurization gets rid of most of those risks.

I drink alcohol. I injest weed. So many people smoke cigarettes. We're not science deniers.

You can be educated and dumb at the same time.", "how would they be in your opinion?", "raw milk is not better for you. Even before pasteurization, families that had cows boiled their milk in special milk-boilers to kill off the possible bacteria in it. Hell, it was done even before germ theory was discovered because people noticed how dangerous raw milk can be.

Hmmm interesting.", "She knew the general gist of it, that drinking raw milk can make you sick.

It's not exactly a controlled substance haha.", "Please re read \u2018 stamp at your own risk\u2019.\nAny kind of uncooked food is an hazard. But I I don\u2019t see people get so pissy about sunny side up eggs or your medium rare stake\u2026 same risks. Actually lettuce currently is the major source of food poisoning cases. I don\u2019t see people getting up in arms for lattuce", "I know someone who had a tuberculosis risk.  They were thought to have been exposed and possibly contracted it.\n\nThe treatment for tb is not as simple as antibiotics, but it can be.  It's a long-term treatment.\n\nThis person also had to undergo a time period of isolation, so that if TB did indeed turn positive, that they wouldn't have exposed anyone in the isolation time period.\n\nThe treatment can take four, six, or nine months.  You probably already know all this.  The info is here for treatment in the US:  [https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm)\n\nIt's a very serious disease and sometimes even the drugs used to treat diseases can themselves have risks. \n\nI believe there are some strains of TB that are not treatable.  One is the drug resistant strain [https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/treatment/tbdisease.htm)Also, one of the drugs used to treat - is horrible itself and can have life altering implications from the drug alone.

You don't know it until you're the one taking it and suffering it's side effects.", "Yes, lets get scared of EVERYTHING. It's such a lovely way to live life, taking every possibility as a MAJOR life threat that's going to kill EVERYONE around us.", "because not all food poisoning is the same. Salmonella from eggs or e-coli from lettuce will get you pretty sick. Raw milk can carry all these bacteria and more. And by the nature of how milk is produced even in small farms, if one cow has bacteria in the milk it will contaminate all milk for that day. So it is far more likely to affect a way larger population.\n\nAlthough eating uncooked or undercooked food is always a hazard, different foods carry different hazard levels. And consuming raw milk is substantially more dangerous than eating sunny side up eggs.  \n\n\nAdditionally, people push back against raw milk because the promotion of its consumption is filled with misinformation and pseudoscience. It encourages the people to take the risk of consuming raw milk under false pretenses. It's like if I started promoting eating chicken cooked rare because I claim that cooking it all the way through denatures essential proteins that are beneficial to your body."]}
