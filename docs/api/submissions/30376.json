Yes. Bovine tuberculosis can infect humans and the most common route of infection is from drinking (oral) raw (unpasteurized) milk or eating dairy products made from raw milk. Less commonly, the bacteria can enter the body by breathing in (aerosol) or through breaks in the skin (direct contact).

By 1917, it was mandatory for milk. After that, the incidence of tuberculosis contracted from milk fell dramatically. Non-pulmonary TB disappeared.

If you use a knife with unpasteurised butter and don\u2019t wash it properly, or it gets on the counter and isn\u2019t disinfected properly, anything it touches is now a risk and can make someone sick.\n\nImagine this: you made unpasteurised butter. You used a big metal bowl to wash the butter (for non-butter makers: it\u2019s just a step, you knead the butter under cold water to remove excess buttermilk). You hand wash the bowl in your sink since it\u2019s big and the dishwasher is already full. You don\u2019t soak it in boiling water (continuously boiling) for 20 minutes, which is what it takes to kill TB, and you don\u2019t soak it in a specialized chemical cleaner. Congrats. You now have a TB bowl. \n\nOr, \n\nYou\u2019re making unpasteurised butter and on the counter next to you there\u2019s a tray of something, maybe you just made cookies or just made rolls or there\u2019s a bowl of fruit. Some of the raw milk spatters out and lands on the food. Voil\u00e0, TB cookies.\n\nFood safety is no joke. It only takes infecting someone with TB once to ruin multiple people\u2019s lives. If someone around you gets TB, the health department will quarantine them and investigate. They\u2019ll investigate everything they ate, everywhere they were, and everyone they were in close contact with and trace it back to you and your illegal unpasteurised milk supplier.\n\nI\u2019m not exaggerating, you seem to have absolutely no idea how downright dangerous your actions are. **THAT\u2019S WHY IT\u2019S ILLEGAL.** \n\nIt\u2019s like not wearing your seatbelt because it was legal when your grandparents were kids and they didn\u2019t make you wear a seatbelt when they babysat you.

I had milk from a cow in school one time, and it was really watery but looking back, that cow wasn't exactly in shape to be a real dairy cow and they probably just couldn't bring themselves to slaughter it. I thought you milked the cow, let it sit for a while, and then siphoned off the good stuff and threw away the watery whey stuff. But I imagine I'm mixing up 5 different dairy processing techniques into a huge mess of cheese, yogurt, whey, milk, and cream confusion."]}
