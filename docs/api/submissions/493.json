My fianc\u00e9 borrowed 3 tables from my sister and brother in law. He brought tables back after party and put them away in their shed. Come this Saturday my sister and brother in law and throwing a Halloween party they take out all their tables and tents and realize the 3 tables my fianc\u00e9 brought back aren\u2019t theirs ,they clearly got mixed up, and they are cheaper made tables compared to their thicker and sturdier tables they purchased. I was over helping decorate and saw this unfold, my brother in law was annoyed and said he didn\u2019t want to let anyone borrow anything again (also referring to another situation that happened when his neighbor borrowed something). So I called up my fianc\u00e9 and yes i was being quite rude and told him to figure out the table situation and bring them back today, those were my words and not my sister or brother in law they didn\u2019t say they needed the tables that day. They just simply wanted their original tables back. Speaking with my fianc\u00e9 the next day he was quite upset that they were upset the tables were mixed up. He thinks that they shouldn\u2019t be mad and they should just buy new tables (bc i mentioned to him if he can\u2019t get tables back then just buy them two new ones again my words not theirs). He then proceeds to go on and on about how he has done so much electrical work for free at their home over the years . I turned to my fianc\u00e9 and said that doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the situation. I told him he should see why they were upset (again not at him but the fact that their tables got mixed up). And my fianc\u00e9s I feel is taking it as an attack at him (it\u2019s ducking tables dude) when in fact they just want their correct tucking tables lol. But i also think he is wrong for bringing up how much work he has done at their house for free and some work has even been paid but obvy like 50% off what they were quoted on. \n\nBut AITA for telling my fianc\u00e9 he needs to go get the tables back or buy new ones ? And not agreeing that all the electrical work he did someone dissolves him of the action of finding their tables or buying new ones ?", "created_utc": 1667163990, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhpy47/aita_for_taking_my_sister_and_brother_in_law_side/", "score": 13, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not at all surprising that he's conflating an error (wrong tables) with a discount for something else. \n\nAnd yeah, so wholly and completely NTA, but your fiance...", "NTA. You are correct.", "maybe it could\u2019ve been handled better but definitely NTA", "Info: did you explain to your fiance that you are the one insisting on replacements and that it is your rudeness that is colouring the issue? \n\nIt sounds like BIL was going to just let it go and not bring it up, and just not loan anything out next time. He's not the one making a mountain out of it and is moving on.\n\nI don't think it's wrong for him to bring up the work he's done on the side - he's just indicating that he's done favours for them, and quite rightly deserves done slack in return. Which was done by BIL not making a big fuss and going after him directly asking for the original items back.", "NTA. And unless an express agreement was made that he would do work for them in exchange for a favor down the road, like failing to return specific items that were borrowed, then one situation has nothing to do with the other.", "\tNTA - when borrowing anything it should be returned in the same or better condition and it shouldn\u2019t be very difficult to figure out who has the tables either, a few phone calls or texts would do it.", "YTA for how you brought it up. You sound very aggressive.\n\nIf you are always on the opposite side to him and always this rude, why is he even with you?\n\nSounds like he just needs to separate family and business and stop doing favors for your family and asking for favors from them too. Talk and not do, basically. Makes it easier for him, then he doesn't need to get ganged up on for a simple mistake when he does things for them too, just to get treated like that.\n\nLike you said, it's just tables lol. I wouldn't be that rude, or rude at all, to someone because they mixed up similar looking tables that I use so rarely that they have to be put into storage. Especially when they are doing skilled labor, like electrical work, for me for free or greatly reduced prices and we are family. Poor guy.\n\nActually, thinking on it more. He can just charge them regular pricing for all future work and not do any more favors, even unrelated to electrician stuff. Then he can make his table money back and he'll have a nice fund for future just in case he borrows their cake tins one day and brings them back 2 19x14 tins instead of the 2 18x13 tins they lent him, and you call him and bitch to him about how he needs to replace them immediately or else.", "YTA. You should have asked him nicely. It was a simple mistake; he didn't do it on purpose. No need to get rude and nasty.

But i see it as don\u2019t do favors for ppl and then use that in the future to your advantage. Do favors for ppl out of the kindness of your heart not with intentions on getting something out of it on your end. \n\nAnd BIL and Sister were annoyed and want their original tables back for sure. They weren\u2019t letting it go but they also weren\u2019t giving him shit . I was just there and witnessed when they realized it wasn\u2019t their stuff and rightfully so they were annoyed. Which i can\u2019t blame them if i lent something out and got something shittier in return I\u2019d be annoyed. They def still want their tables back and i don\u2019t think they are wrong for it", "Agreed thank you !! Also I\u2019m not a fan of I\u2019ve done this for you so you need to do this for me. Unless otherwise expressed.", "In his eyes I\u2019m always on the opposite side of him but there are many times I\u2019m in agreement with him (I\u2019m sure he would agree with that as well just not when he\u2019s mad) I\u2019m just more of the type of person that i like to see all sides of a problem and see where ppl are coming from. There\u2019s times I agree with him on certain points but not the overall. Im a human an made a human error lol I\u2019m not always rude and can admit wrong doings and apologize. I guess he\u2019s still with me bc having a relationship where someone agrees with you on everything is kinda boring - just saying. \n\nAlso he wasn\u2019t ganged up on by my sister or brother in law. The only negative thing was me being rude and asking him to get the table situation sorted out that day. (Which besides being rude and getting it done that day it was 100% correct in my eyes) So no gang banging there lol \n\nAlso again. Tables weren\u2019t in storage lol they were in their backyard shed. They don\u2019t just keep party tables out and open. They don\u2019t have 5 party/ picnic tables just randomly opened around their house lol.  Also nobody said tables aren\u2019t used rarely (not sure where you are pulling this info from). In actuality these tables are used a lot through the year for parties and especially outdoor summer gatherings and parties. \n\nAt the end of the day if someone borrowed your car and returned it as a lesser model , would you be cool with it if they do the landscaping around your pool every year for you? \n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say if someone lends something out they should get it back in the same condition and same item. Not switched out with a cheaper model. Yes it was an accident and wasn\u2019t on purpose and no one is accusing anyone of that. But at the end of the day I agree they should get their correct tables back.\n\nBut thank you for your outlook on the situation appreciate it overall", "I hear that. Thank you, you are definitely right i should\u2019ve have gotten rude and angry with him", "Lol  i think it might cover a goat and cow too. I should tell my sister and brother in law they owe us !!!", "Thank you for the added info - he's anal about his work is good, because it's about other people's homes and stuff. So are the tables, of course, so we have a contrast that I don't get. In my experience, professionalism like that usually extends into private life and caring for others' things. \n\nI hope your SIL and BIL end up with the same quality tables in the end. Good luck.", "Yw and he really needs to get those tables back. I\u2019m wondering how he didn\u2019t notice they weren\u2019t the same tables when he brought them back.", "Lol, that's how the world works. People don't just do favors for people that don't help them in some way.", "Oh they will my fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t cheap and 100% will pay for new tables if he can\u2019t find where their originals went. But he just couldn\u2019t see why i thought their annoyance was justified and always thinks I\u2019m against him and always take other ppls sides when in reality i like to look at both sides and can see truth and understanding from both views but at the end of the day right is right and he borrowed something and returned something different which should be rectified which im sure if he didn\u2019t something electrical that wasn\u2019t right he would fix it. But i think he just really gets upset that he thinks im never on his side and just ends up talking nonsense i.e this table situation", "In his defense they do all look somewhat similar and he even put my sisters name on them but didn\u2019t put the names on them immediately only when all the tables where mixed together and he basically just guessed like oh these were them . But aerially they are the ones that fold with a handle and the other ones look similar but they are skinnier and not the same brand my sister had . Honest mistake but he needs to rectify it", "Yes to an extent i agree. But also i don\u2019t, especially in this scenario. Free/Discounted Electrical work doesn\u2019t equal I mixed up your tables so you need to deal with that and be happy bc I\u2019ve done free/discounted work for you. The favor was already granted by lending the tables that doesn\u2019t extend to you effed up my shid but we cool no worries.", "No, it just means I expect to not be treated rudely if I make a small mistake, when I do all these other favors for you.\n\nAlso, if it's such a small issue that you say he shouldn't have a problem with fixing the issue and being treated rudely, then it should be small enough that it doesn't necessitate the response he got. If someone called me and was that rude over some tables that are very similar but a little lower quality, I'd definitely distance myself from them. Not like they use the tables every weekend if they didn't notice the mistake from August until the end of October.\n\nAlso, if we're looking at the favors, one side is getting a massively better deal than the other. Dirt cheap electrician work or some tables I rarely ever use? I know which I'd pick.", "I get what your saying but also ,\n\nI was being rude to him not my sister/BIL. My fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t doing a favor for me the person that was rude to him. He was doing the favor for my sister and BIL. So you are mixing it up my guy", "My sister and brother in law did not yell or even have the initial conversation about the tables with my fianc\u00e9. I think you are confusing my actions with my sister and brother in law . Who weren\u2019t rude and just asked to get the tables sorted out lol", "Seems you are the one misunderstanding my comments.\n\n1) You, as the sister of the affected party, are essentially also their mouthpiece. It's usually safe to assume that when your SO brings up a problem relating to their side of the family that they are the middleman, which you were in this case. Just because they didn't personally act rude, doesn't mean that your words aren't seen as partly their words/feelings on the situation as well. If my SO we're to come screaming to me(unrelated example) about how I forgot to lock their sister's hamster's cage and it escaped, I'd assume that my SO is probably responding similarly to how her sister did when she brought it up to her. I wouldn't assume her sister was calm, collected and kind and my SO just went off on me of her own accord. I'd assume she got some serious shit for it and was then reciprocating to me, to show how big of a deal it was to her sister and how her sister reacted to the situation. Same here, I would assume since you made a big deal your sister and BIL we're as well, which it soud s like they were, they just didn't say it to his face but to you instead and you relayed that in your own words.\n\n2) I know you didn't say the tables are in storage, you said in the shed, which is storage. I'm not talking about them renting a storage unit to put their tables in. Just like how a spare room can be a \"storage\" room, or an attic is a \"storage\" space, a shed is also a \"storage\" space.\n\n3) A car is used regularly and the difference in models can be very expensive or come with many different features, so the analogy is not that good. My cake tin analogy is much more representative. Doesn't really affect anything and is barely noticeable, but is still a difference overall. I wouldn't get mad at someone for bringing me a left twix over a right twix since the difference is so small, or someone returning the same type of table in beige when I gave them an eggshell colored one, but I would be pissed if I lent someone a Tesla and they returned with a Nissan, because there is actually a big and important difference, unlike the other examples.\n\n4) if your SO always feels like you are against them, then despite what you say/think, it's safe to assume you are.\n\nAlso, the story is a bit more weird now that I noticed it's your fiance and not just a boyfriend. Like, this is how you act over something so small, and you want to marry him and he wants to marry you/be connected to your family for the rest of his life? If this is how it's gonna be over every little thing, then he has a long road ahead of him.", "I get you. Thanks"]}
