They will judge you and act like they are doing you a favor.\n\nNTA", "NTA, but your wife is. She blocked you & staying at a friend's? That is nit how you act when married & you don't get your way. \n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA- but I would let brother know it's on the house and tell wife that moving forward you will not be doing anyone any \"favors\". This is something that could cause a huge rift in your family life that is not worth it. In order to prevent it happening again I just wouldn't even work with any family period even if they agree to pay because then it opens the door to this bs.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why people expect free stuff from their friends and family\u2019s businesses. If you have a friend, use their business and not others to support them, but don\u2019t expect free stuff. They might, but don\u2019t have to, give you a friends and family discount.", "You did a free draft as a favor, but that doesn't mean you have to do the whole project for free.", "NTA\n\nWhich one is it? Wife or girlfriend?\n\nThe terms were discussed between you and the client. She has no say on the matter.\n\nAnd in no way is this an offense warranting leaving the home for. Either there is something more going on, or your relationship is not well.", "Friends and family should insist on paying full price to support an independent contractor.", "NTA. Family doesn\u2019t mean everything is for free. The draft was free and BIL agreed to pay. Very immature of the wife to block you for this. People forget you need to make some money out of your work/business.", "Is your girlfriend a child? WTH? She needs to be single for awhile to figure her s#!!t out. And good riddance.", "NTA. This is your job, of course you're going to charge. You can give a discount if you want, but to expect free work is ridiculous (but unfortunately not uncommon). Too many people don't respect arts and media the way they should tbh. Sounds like your wife is one of those people", "NTA- my boyfriend freelances as well. He does work for his own sister and BIL and my mom has sent him referrals as well. Every single one of them pay him his full rate. Because they are business people too and realize they are paying for a service.", "So I have a bunch of artist friends. You know what I do when I want art from them? I pay their full commission rates, that's what.\n\nNTA", "Former wedding photographer here. I totally get it...people think you should work for free especially when it makes them look good! I've had people expect $1500 wedding packages for free because \"but, we're family!\" Yeah and if it took me a few minutes I'd absolutely snap some pics for you, but were talking working a whole 8 hour wedding then editing several hours every night for a week! Ridiculous! They way I see it you said you would do the draft free and you did! Then BIL decided to order products and THAT is where the cost comes in. \n\nIf she had expected you to make anything he wanted for free she should have specified that so you could turn her down flat! I think she figured there would be time to talk to you about not charging him at all and things moved faster than she expected. You are NTA and her childish behavior blocking you tells you that she's just mad her \"get you to do free work to make her look good to BIL\" ploy didn't work!", "NTA I can absolutely understand why she would think you wouldn\u2019t charge her brother. The problem here is you were upfront, and he agreed to pay. Getting mad after the fact is ridiculous.", "NTA this is not a hobby it's your profession. as a gift you gave him the rough out and explain for you to take it further would have a cost and he understood.\n\nI wonder if your g/f (ex?) had promised it would be free and she thinks she looks bad now.", "NTA. Next time it\u2019s her uncle, friend, old time friends husband,,, you do this for a living. Not for free.", "NTA. One of my friends is a photographer, and I booked her to do a photoshoot before I moved away. Did I pay her for her services? ABSOLUTELY! That's her job, it's how she makes her living. It doesn't matter if the person is family, a friend, or a stranger, if you hire someone for their services, you pay them. You did the draft for free, as she requested, but anything after that requires payment.", "NTA!! You agreed to do the draft for free, but the actual work is paid. You always deserve to get paid for your work. Now is this a GF or Wife? You have said both", "Agreed. When I commissioned my stepsister for a painting, I fully expected to pay her. And I did. She gave me a discount because we're family, but she still put time, effort, and supplies into making me a gorgeous painting and she deserves to be paid for that. Family shouldn't automatically mean you can take advantage of them", "She\u2019s not even OP\u2019s wife though, just his girlfriend.  The entitlement she\u2019s showing is kinda insane", " He called me out, we had a chat, and agreed on a rate. You\u2019re def in the right here", "Claims she's a wife but called her girlfriend twice.  Not convincing.", "Eh, families provide free services/labor to each other all the time. Especially domestic labor (cooking, childcare, etc.).\n\nMaybe that's where her head is.", "Close friends and family can/maybe should get a close friends and family price. That's it. Asking for any more than that is rude IMO. They should also want to pay you for your time and effort because they are your close friend/family as well and want to support you. Of course there may be other dynamics, like if you were a millionaire and he was struggling or something, then maybe don't charge him?", "Your wife needs to stay out of it. You had an agreement with her brother, not her. If he later decided it cost too much and complained to your wife, she should have directed him to you, and to leave her out of it. This is why doing business with family is more trouble than it's worth.  Let her stay at her friends. It's a manipulation tactic to get her way. If you really want to clap back on this, you can tell her you consider her actions as abandonment of the marriage, and see what she does from there. If she values you and your marriage she will come home and act like an adult. If she puts up more of a fuss, you know you are lower in her priorities than her brother.", "Twice?", "Unless it\u2019s in one of OP\u2019s comments, I don\u2019t see anywhere it says the brother is unhappy with there being a charge for the final product. My guess is the gf found out the final product wasn\u2019t free and she\u2019s the one having the hissy fit about it.", "This is my concern, why would she leave over a job you did?  Does she always throw temper tantrums if things don't go exactly how she thinks they should?  If this is normal behavior for her, you may want to take the opportunity to get away before you have kids with her.  I hate suggesting divorce, but she sure did create some major drama over nothing.  I would leave her be.  NTA", "I'm suddenly very grateful for my friends.  I recently started a small business and every single friend who's bought from me has paid me full price, even though I've given them a discount.  I offered one friend who has done some pretty awesome advertising for me a free item and she refused to take it for free, refused to take a discount and ordered 5 more items, refusing the discount on all of them.", "NTA, you that\u2019s almost free for the amount of work you did.", "I cant get a tech into my building without a $500 charge.  I would guess the cost much much more in my corporate environment. Like $10,000 for something like that...", "I agree with you. Also, to be fair, the brother should have asked how much first.", "Even after their friends realized it, they didn't throw a tantrum.", "But many people probably don't know that.", "Don't worry it's the femcels downvoting everything they see", "She is way too immature to be a wife.", "Do you know what speculating means? We are missing information. For the sake of the discourse some of us are making assumptions and running with that. All of this contributes to the overall discussion. Thus unraveling a little more truth.", "Better yet, I'll ask you a simple question. How do you think the information got to his girlfriend? \n\nThis is all moot anyway. Op mentions brother agreed to price to begin with. Wich would make you ultimately correct I believe."]}
