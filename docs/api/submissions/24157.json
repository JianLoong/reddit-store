I'm a freelance logo designer, and usually I'm booked, but these days I had free slots, so I told her that I could do it. She asked me if I could do a free draft as a favor.\n\nI agreed, and we started with the free draft. I did it within a day, and her brother loved it and asked if I could finish it and also the brand identity for his business. I told him that this would cost him, and he happily agreed.\n\nI finished in two days and sent him the receipt. A few hours later, my girlfriend calls me and tells me that I am the asshole for charging him. I told her that he agreed to pay, and she responded by telling me that I shouldn't have asked for payment and that even if he offered, I should've refused.\n\nShe blocked me after that and has been sleeping at her friend's house since.\n\nI had been thinking that maybe I was wrong for charging her brother; she requested that I do a free draft for her brother.\n\nSo guys, AITA here?", "created_utc": 1691480456, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15lb4qy/aita_for_charging_my_wifes_brother/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does your wife help with any of the work for your business?  Has her brother helped you guys out with anything without receiving payment?  This kind of stuff factors in.
