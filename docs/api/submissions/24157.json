The gentle way I do it in my business is simply asking THEM what sort of budget they have. If it\u2019s a super low-ball budget I gently explain to them the realities of what my job entails and what I generally charge. Usually an agreement can be made up front as to what you are willing to do within their budget. Always get the hard conversations out of the way first so that you can simply focus on your work.", "YTA.

If I wanted them to do work for friends or inlaws I would pay them.  It's a little trickier because it's not like you can pay yourself really, but uh, your wife does understand that this is your job right?", "NTA. You don\u2019t work for free and you and the brother discussed this ahead of time. \n\nBlocking you over this is immature and petty. How old are y\u2019all? That\u2019s not how adults handle things.", "NTA. Your wife never explicitly said that you should do this work for free. I get that it\u2019s for her brother but what\u2019s next? Free work for friends? He agreed to pay, I don\u2019t see what the problem is. Also, she blocked you and has temporarily moved out over this? Sounds like you have more important things to deal with.

Your gf doesn\u2019t know your industry enough to know the difference between a free draft and a free end product. Would you have given the brother a free end product if she had asked? How big is her family and how many more requests could you see if this nature? You two need to discuss and get on the same page.", "NTA, her brother agreed to pay so what is the problem? Why should you do your work for free because that's her brother? That's actually crazy of her to ask and with her behaviour afterwards you be digging a bullet here. Does she not respect what you do?

My husband does this sometimes and I have to remind him that I have a business to run, if I don\u2019t charge, I don\u2019t get paid. A lot of times family/friends are customers, that would be a huge loss! You have to run a business. He agreed to the price.

If she thought you should offer to do the whole thing for free, she should have said that in the first place. Does she understand how design work usually progresses from draft logo -> client review and approval -> full branding? \n\nLike I guess I'm trying to understand, is this a lack of understanding/bad assumptions on her part, or was she trying to run a bait and switch on you and is pissed that you broke her plans by working quickly and communicating with her brother directly.", "NTA She asked for a free draft which she got, she didn\u2019t ask for free intellectual property.

Plus, with her severe reaction, you dodged a bullet my man. Set her free to torment some other dude.", "Your not an AH but a lot of people will do work for close relatives for free, I've done plenty of electrical work for my wife's parents and siblings for no more than a cup of tea while I'm working and a pint when I'm finished its good to keep them onside.", "NTA. You should be happy your girlfriend left. I would invite her to stay gone.", "NTA and not it's time to find a new girlfriend because she clearly believes that she owns you, your time, and your business.

I make 60+ an hour at my main job, I usually charge 20-40/hr (I'm up front about it, it depends on the level of ass pain and if I'm going to them/they come to me).

If my friend is an accountant but has a side business doing design because they enjoy it and want to earn a bit of money doing it, it would be a dick move of me to eat up their personal time expecting them to do free labour for me.\n\nIt's not a way I'd expect a friend to behave and I really don't understand anyone who gets angry at their friends for not giving them a discount they randomly feel entitled to.", "Yeah I know a lot of community schemes like that which encourage people to support local businesses.\n\nWhen I say \"mate's rates\" I mean it more in the sense that an individual expects discounts from someone running a small business or service just because they're friends.

Going forward I've been very sure to give them a ballpark that is above the bare minimum expected, and then they can be surprised if it's less, not pissed off that it's more.", ">I finished in two days and sent him the receipt.
