I get being a little hurt and maybe feeling like your not part of the family but if they treat her 99.9% of the time like family and the only .1percent is this Christmas card then she just needs to shut up cause she\u2019s nuts and you need to run far far away from this woman", "\u2026oh my\u2026\n\nThis man\u2019s whole account is one big cry for help.

If the mother changes it now, it could cause issues with OP's brother and SIL too, for the unequal treatment. \n\nI'd say NTA to OP, and his fiancee is being incredibly childish if she can't understand the simple concept of \"the same rules for everyone\". Not to mention the pettiness of already planning revenge at the wedding.", "If 50 percent of marriages fail, imagine how many engagements don't make it to the wedding. His mom made a rule, she's consistent in it's application, fiance needs to back off", "This is what I would want to know. I was with my husband for 15 years before we married and only married when it made financial sense to do so. My in-laws referred to me as their \"almost daughter-in-law\" for 10 years. I would have been pretty bummed if I had been excluded from a family picture because of a piece of paper.", "Lots of photos with unmarried partners are taken.

She's also potentially damaging OP's and her own relationship to the brother and his wife as well - I know I would dislike it if someone from outside the family came in and demanded preferential treatment that I/my own wife didn't get. And if MIL allows it I'd be annoyed with her as well (if I were the brother/brother's wife).  \n\n\nSo, the way I see it, not giving in to fiancee's demands has the potential to damage the fiancee's relationship with the family, but giving in has the potential to damage the relationship between any combination of OP and fiancee, MIL, and brother/wife. For MIL, giving in opens the door to similar arguments down the line as well, meaning that even more relationships could be second-hand damaged by OP's fiancee being entitled and expecting the rules not to apply to her, because MIL is going to have to have this discussion every time from now on.  \n\n\nOP, your fiancee will be in lots of family pictures in the future (unless she's equally demanding and unreasonable on other things and you (hopefully) realize that before you go through with the wedding).
