They can (from how you said, they WILL) take photos with and without your fiance. If y'all are married by the time cards get sent out, why would your parents not choose a main photo with a new married family member who was present at the event? Your family is the one making this to be an issue in a fairly controlling way, if your comment is accurate. This should never have been an issue in the first place. Why are they doing this if they're so nice about throwing you an engagement party?", "NTA", "But like, how do they treat her? Are they interested in her as a person?

I think it's fair for your mom to want some photos of just her immediate family. If not, ESH. In that case, your fiancee is overreacting to a minor slight but everyone else is being jerk-y to her in general and I'm not surprised she sees the photos as a big thing.", "Is this by chance your second marriage?", "Ok with this info added my earlier comment would change slightly cause I added that I would personally feel hurt but i was thinking they treated her less than family based on her reaction and that it was family photos but if she\u2019s included in every family photo aside from the Christmas ones that get sent to all extended family and your moms friends then definitely NTA and she is doing way to much for something so insignificant. I get being a little hurt and maybe feeling like your not part of the family but if they treat her 99.9% of the time like family and the only .1percent is this Christmas card then she just needs to shut up cause she\u2019s nuts and you need to run far far away from this woman", "\u2026oh my\u2026\n\nThis man\u2019s whole account is one big cry for help.

If the mother changes it now, it could cause issues with OP's brother and SIL too, for the unequal treatment. \n\nI'd say NTA to OP, and his fiancee is being incredibly childish if she can't understand the simple concept of \"the same rules for everyone\". Not to mention the pettiness of already planning revenge at the wedding.", "If 50 percent of marriages fail, imagine how many engagements don't make it to the wedding. His mom made a rule, she's consistent in it's application, fiance needs to back off", "This is what I would want to know. I was with my husband for 15 years before we married and only married when it made financial sense to do so. My in-laws referred to me as their \"almost daughter-in-law\" for 10 years. I would have been pretty bummed if I had been excluded from a family picture because of a piece of paper.", "Lots of photos with unmarried partners are taken.

She's also potentially damaging OP's and her own relationship to the brother and his wife as well - I know I would dislike it if someone from outside the family came in and demanded preferential treatment that I/my own wife didn't get. And if MIL allows it I'd be annoyed with her as well (if I were the brother/brother's wife).  \n\n\nSo, the way I see it, not giving in to fiancee's demands has the potential to damage the fiancee's relationship with the family, but giving in has the potential to damage the relationship between any combination of OP and fiancee, MIL, and brother/wife. For MIL, giving in opens the door to similar arguments down the line as well, meaning that even more relationships could be second-hand damaged by OP's fiancee being entitled and expecting the rules not to apply to her, because MIL is going to have to have this discussion every time from now on.  \n\n\nOP, your fiancee will be in lots of family pictures in the future (unless she's equally demanding and unreasonable on other things and you (hopefully) realize that before you go through with the wedding).

After reading this post and his other, it seems clear he\u2019s constantly walking on eggshells as his fianc\u00e9 is emotionally abusive and unstable. OP, you need to really think about whether you want to be yourself in a loving and supportive relationship or if you want\u2026.this.  Many people feel comfortable enough to show their true colors after marriage as the spouse is \u201clocked in\u201d. If it\u2019s this bad now, how do you think she will behave after the wedding? Are you prepared to sacrifice your relationship with your family to appease her?\n\nFurthermore, it\u2019s not just about you, OP. What happens if you have kids? I grew up in this exact situation, and it was verbal, physical, emotional, and financial abuse. It will also change the dynamic and give her the opportunity to triangulate to sustain emotional instability and ensure she has the excitement she craves. You would be giving her her very own hostage! After living with someone with untreated, co-morbid NPD and BPD from birth to early adulthood, I beg of you to read up on cluster B in personality disorders.

His fianc\u00e9e is absolutely nuts.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a test\u2026 more of a CYA policy \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "A year or two. That's a really short time before getting married. I know a lot of relations that break between 2 and 3 years.", "Whos insecure enough to care that their partners ex is in the old family photo is the real question. Why would you need to take them down. They are a snapshot in time, that' how things were at that time", "I think if it's hidden in an album it's fine. But if your in laws had photos up on the wall with your partners last SO everywhere, it would feel weird. Especially if they weren't married or don't have kids together or dated for like 3 months. \n\nThose photos still have a place, but when thetes a new partner who could feel excluded, that place is no longer to be prominently displayed.", "Maybe the person who dated them doesn't want to be reminded of them.", "You should read his history. It's really sad and this woman is manipulating him.", "My cousin got engaged a momth into knowing a woman, that kinda rule saved him because she screamed and yelled that she was family two months into us knowing her lol", "Strongly disagree. This is a solid (shouldn\u2019t be any questions about it) rule. If fianc\u00e9e does, in fact, join the family thru marriage and it stands the test of time, there will be plenty of family photos to join. NTA", "\"it don't mean a thing if you don't got that ring\"", "Also...you can take two photos, one with the fiance and one without", "Yikes! He needs to run for his life.", "100% spot on. Great way to put it. OP's family still values marriage as a custom. That's their prerogative. Just cause fewer people in general society are getting married doesn't mean they have to adjust their values. That's ridiculous.", "Fair enough. I guess I just don\u2019t understand what\u2019s so sacred about a family photo. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "My wedding photographer insisted on getting pictures with SOs and without them for this very reason. Low and behold, both my brothers broke up with their long term girlfriends in the next few years. I'm so glad for that photographer having foresight.", "Dated or not, it's their policy. If all the other siblings SO had to deal with it, then so should she. It's really not a big deal. She just sounds like drama.", "Why would I be entitled to be included in my partner's *parents* Christmas card? I'm not their kid.", "My grandmother had that rule. It really upset my cousins because my wife was included.\n\n\nTurns out almost none of them are still with the people they were with when grandma died even. I got married at 18 have now been married for 29 years."]}
