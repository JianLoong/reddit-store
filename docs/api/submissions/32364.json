I have a daughter Chloe of my own from my previous marriage age 9. Sadie has a daughter Ace19 from an ex. Ace hasn\u2019t really been in our lives often; as she lived with her grandparents her whole life bc the state took her from Sadie when Ace when 7. We still saw her on holidays and tried to reach out. \n\nAce was living out of state with her boyfriend but he was recently arrested, so she asked if her and her baby could move in with us as she needed help getting back on her feet. My wife and I spoke about it and agreed. When I brought up the extra bedroom in the attic(which is an area in the attic we made into a spare room for guest many years ago and no one uses the attic anyways)  my wife became upset- gasped even- and said she was not making her daughter with a 5 month old baby sleep in the dirty attic. I said obviously we would clean and prepare it, and where else did she suggest she sleep, which is when she told me Chloe bedroom would be perfect.\n\n\nChloe bedroom is very large and across the hall from the bathroom which Sadie said was perfect. I told her Chloe would not be giving up her bedroom she\u2019d been living in since before I even met her. She got upset and started to plead and said that this could make up for the years loss, and proved she really loved her and that she was wanted.\n\nI basically told her no, she could prove that another way that we wouldn\u2019t give up the bedroom. She got angry and said a 9 year old does not need all that space, and I was picking favorites and not even thinking of the bigger picture, ace wld need more room, it\u2019s be hard for her to go up and down the stares with a baby, etc. I stuck to my answer and my wife slammed the door and went for a drive. \n\nToday she tried convincing me again and I wouldn\u2019t give in and we got into another argument.

You most definitely should *not* displace your daughter from her bedroom to make room for Ace. Having a 19 year old stranger and her baby move in is going to be more than enough of a change for your daughter.  Your wife can find some other way to \"make up for the yeas of loss\" without kicking your daughter out of her bedroom.  Sadie has already proven that Ace is wanted by taking in her and her baby.  As for the stairs, women safely carry babies/children up and down stairs every day.  \n\nINFO: Do you know why Ace was removed from Sadie's care?", "Sir, this is the hill to die on. Time for your wife to be held accountable for her life choices, time for her daughter to be held accountable for her life choices. Your innocent 9-year-old daughter doesn\u2019t deserve to pay dearly for others\u2019 life choices. Woman needs to get over herself and her dumb silent treatment. If she doesn\u2019t let this go, maybe it\u2019s time to go your separate ways. If you give in, your daughter will forever remember how her dad treated his \u201cnew\u201d family better.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife sounds like she wants Ace and the baby to become a permanent fixture in your household rather than putting her up till she finds her feet.\n\nYour wife is entirely out of line for wanting to sacrifice your daughter to make up for her own past actions.", "NTA. Your wife is trying to make it up to her daughter by penalising yours. The fact that the \"dirty\" attic isn't good enough for *her* child but is good enough for *yours* is atrocious.\n\nI'm going to be mean here. Sadie was a young mother. But Sadie had the state *take her child* when she was in her *mid twenties*, I know there's a lot of stories of unfairness, but they do *not* take a child away from their adult parent for no reason. At best, she's been an absent mother. I know she's tried to reach out, but she doesn't have a parental relationship with Ace. Staying strong here is important, not just because it's not fair, but because Sadie has already destroyed one parent/child relationship, now she going to destroy two more (hers AND yours with Chloe) to try and salvage the ruined one.\n\nAce is now also a young mother. She needs support, the support that I'm guessing Sadie didn't get. Ace has had a tough draw growing up, but she's also made some poor decisions and it's great that she two of you are going to support her. But she gets the support that is *available* (I'm not blaming her for any of this, this is all on Sadie). \n\nChloe's room is not an available resource. You'll spend money and time and effort helping her. Chloe is going to go through a massive upheaval, bringing two new humans into her home, both strangers, one an infant. Having some stability and privacy is key, she *needs* that room, possibly more than Ace does.\n\nYou need to find out what Sadie is promising Ace. You need to find out what Ace thinks she's in for. And you need to make it clear to Sadie that Chloe is just and important as you and Sadie in house decisions, because it's her home too. Ace with be with you temporarily (so long as she really is just getting back on her feet). She isn't a guest, but she's not a decision maker either.\n\nSadie needs help dealing with whatever is going on in her head. Whether it's guilt. Whether it's thinking that \"her\" family is more important than \"yours\". Whether it's thinking that having a baby means you're entitled to preferential treatment. Whether she's trying to cope with her own past by giving Ace what she didn't get herself. But Sadie needs to deal with what is available, before she destroys another family.", "NTA but consider having her move elsewhere with Ace.

However, her desire to \u201cfix\u201d things with Ace can\u2019t come at the expense of your household harmony. An attic has a large space is a good option for Ace, especially since room is supposed to be temporary. \n\nWho owns the house? You, right? \nCan ACE not stay with grandparents? \n\nI assume you or your wife agreed to spend time and money outfitting the space, cleaning it, and making it look homey. That\u2019s a fair compromise. If you can afford it, add nursery things, a bed, lights, tv, etc. Alternately, you can offer her 1st/last for an apartment. If furnishing the space isn\u2019t in your budget, how does your wife plan on doing so? \n\nBefore she moves in, make sure Ace (and your wife) has a plan for sobriety, curfew, legal responsibilities, childcare, job, saving, etc. Be very clear in your expectations and requirements for offering her space. Have them research resources for single mothers. PS Absolutely do not let Chloe get roped into being a babysitter. \n\nYou\u2019re being a good person by opening your home. Don\u2019t let anyone tear you down! \n\nBTW. TBH I don\u2019t see how this situation is going to work out well for your family. Your wife isn\u2019t being reasonable, Ace and your family don\u2019t know each other well, and there is probably a whole lifetime of regret and anger between the two that will explode in your house at some point. Be prepared for the consequences of reuniting these two under your roof. \n\nSo, make sure to have a convo with Chloe and ask her if a new person and a baby coming into the home is OK with her. If it isn\u2019t, address her concerns or find other ways to support Ace than housing her. Make sure Chloe knows she can always tell you if she is uncomfortable. \n\nGood luck!", "NTA- \n\nYou're offering to put the guest in the guest suite... Which is where guests stay...

I have a daughter Chloe of my own from my previous marriage age 9. Sadie has a daughter Ace19 from an ex. Ace hasn\u2019t really been in our lives often; as she lived with her grandparents her whole life bc the state took her from Sadie when Ace when 7. We still saw her on holidays and tried to reach out. \n\nAce was living out of state with her boyfriend but he was recently arrested, so she asked if her and her baby could move in with us as she needed help getting back on her feet. My wife and I spoke about it and agreed. When I brought up the extra bedroom in the attic(which is an area in the attic we made into a spare room for guest many years ago and no one uses the attic anyways)  my wife became upset- gasped even- and said she was not making her daughter with a 5 month old baby sleep in the dirty attic. I said obviously we would clean and prepare it, and where else did she suggest she sleep, which is when she told me Chloe bedroom would be perfect.\n\n\nChloe bedroom is very large and across the hall from the bathroom which Sadie said was perfect. I told her Chloe would not be giving up her bedroom she\u2019d been living in since before I even met her. She got upset and started to plead and said that this could make up for the years loss, and proved she really loved her and that she was wanted.\n\nI basically told her no, she could prove that another way that we wouldn\u2019t give up the bedroom. She got angry and said a 9 year old does not need all that space, and I was picking favorites and not even thinking of the bigger picture, ace wld need more room, it\u2019s be hard for her to go up and down the stares with a baby, etc. I stuck to my answer and my wife slammed the door and went for a drive. \n\nToday she tried convincing me again and I wouldn\u2019t give in and we got into another argument.

I have made a point in several comments that if it is ladder steps, then neither Chloe or Ace and her newborn shpuld have to climb them. It's not safe.

When I lived with my mum, our spare room wasn't used for 5 years and it just needed a wipe down, and changed the never slept in bed linen when my cousin and his fiance stayed. We opened the windows to air it out, every day for those 5 years because it was habbit to do it in every room in the house and only vacuumed it weekly because we only walked in to open and close the damn windows. It will take less than half a day to make an unused room immaculate. Including wiping down ceiling/walls, all furnishings, vacuuming, changing the bed linen and you could even clean the carpet. I could do all of that in a day in my whole 1 bedroom plus office flat with the help of my boyfriend. We do a deep clean once a month and the 2 times we cleaned the carpets as well (every 6 months) it only took us an extra 3 hours for hallway, bedroom, sitting room and office carpets. That is 5 rooms and 4 carpets in a heavily used space as i work from home in little over half a day.\nIt should take a generous 3 hours tops to deep clean 1 unused attic bedroom as a single person. 2 people doing it will definitely take less than an also generous 2 hours. If they have a mould or infestation problem, it will need to be dealt with before anyone can move in there safely. If it is mould, well, they haven't been airing it out every day.
