Where you can come in is give her the opportunity to earn her a coloring book. Like, if she doesn't do dishes, tell her to do dishes for a month to earn the coloring book.

You mentioned in another comment that she knows all this stuff but was too lazy to do it.\n\nBut, I do want to touch on a few things\n- Puppies have small bladders and naturally just go more often than adult dogs. If the pup is sleeping in your daughter's room, is it being brought outside frequently enough (I assume your daughter goes to bed earlier than you, isn't getting up in the middle of the night, and probably wakes up after you). \n- Make sure you're rewarding her responsibility as much as letting her experience the consequences of her laziness. Maybe agree to a mother-daughter day or other reward once you all survive the potty training period\n- double check she has put out the potty pad before bed. At the end of the day, she's only 10 and still needs oversight. Two seconds of your time can save a huge headache.", "an already-trained dog is a big difference from a puppy that's still being trained.

The rigid rules.\n\nIt's understandable you gave her all the warning and that the rules were already laid out and so since she does get allowances, she can save up. But it's good to also humanize her and realize that people (especially young ones) are more prone to making mistakes, so I think an alternative route (if you can financially afford it) is to give her the opportunity for additional responsibilities above the ones that she already has.\n\nIt's like taking a class and the teacher says you need to do your homework and pass the exam. The rules are set, but it's kind of a nice feeling when the teacher says we have an opportunity to earn extra credit.\n\nGive her that \"extra credit\" opportunity where she has to do XYZ to earn her coloring book.", "Yes you are, the 2yo couldn't care less, you are just being vindictive. You can keep your precious pens and colouring book  don't worry. She'll learn, alright!", "She said that the 10 year old was supposed to take the dog out and didn't.

I also don't think putting the pee pad down should be all her responsibility. If she forgets, again, like children do, then you need to step up and put one down.

So it\u2019s time to rework that night time schedule for pup. I am 100% an advocate for using a crate or pen at night when dogs are still potty training, so I\u2019m naturally going to recommend that.", "I WANT to use a crate. I take over dog duty at night when everyone else is asleep. I have 5 dogs, 4 are house broke. I hate puppy pads. I never thought about litter. Idk how big this dogs is going to be. She\u2019s already at 10 pounds and the biggest one we have.", "Do you know what breed she is? From the post I thought she was another yorkie. \n\nSorry to get off topic, but my experience lies with dogs and puppies, so hopefully I can help you make THAT less stressful, at least!", "The lady I got her from said she was a shih tzu. Nah. I think she\u2019s a shih tzu poodle mix. She\u2019s hard headed, stubborn as hell, has more energy than both of my kids combined. It\u2019s becoming a nightmare.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nIt's a coloring book, not her only winter coat or some other necessity.\n\nHave the conversation with your daughter about the situation being reversed. \n\nThis is an important life lesson. Throughout her life she will deal with people who don't respect their own things but expect others to compensate for their irresponsibility. She'll either become a doormat for these people or learn to stand up for herself. \n\nYou've done the right thing.", "NTA, but during the puppy stage, definitely be more present in making sure animal tasks are completed daily. Your kid could teach your dog bad habits not knowing any better and you're going to be the one to suffer.", "NTA. Actions (or inactions) have consequences. That's what you are teaching your daughter. She'll get over it. Tell her if she had picked up her things like she was supposed to, it wouldn't have happened. If you just keep giving her your things, or replacement things, she will never learn this lesson and will continue to treat her things carelessly.", "YTA a ten year old shouldn\u2019t be clearly up dog mess. And it\u2019s a picture of a unicorn give her the colouring book!", "NTA.  \nIf she didn't want her things ruined then she should have taken care of them. Simple.", "YTA. It doesn't sound like parenting, it sounds like a two 10 year olds conflict and your comments only make it worse. You are very set on making your daughter who is a kid suffer just to prove your point instead of showing her empathy. Don't get where all these nta are coming from.", "Why shouldnt it be? Let the dog outside..put down a training pad...are not incredibly hard tasks for a 10 year old.", "Natural consequences for the win. So many parents focus on punishment (we are quite the puritanical society aren\u2019t we) when it\u2019s often not necessary nor reflective of real life. \n\nNot picking up your stuff around a new puppy, resulting in puppy destroying said items, especially after being reminded? That\u2019s a given and reflective of real life. You\u2019re doing great. Dad sounds like he doesn\u2019t wanna deal with her whining as she learns new lessons, the, ahem, natural consequence of having a 10 year old lol", "She\u2019s usually so on top of things with both her older dog and the puppy. Maybe it\u2019s just too much pressure and I need to help more. I don\u2019t know. She did say she didn\u2019t bring puppy out because she was on her tablet and in my opinion, that\u2019s just her being lazy or not wanting to do it. She could have asked me if I\u2019d do it, I wouldn\u2019t have minded one bit but I seriously thought she took pup out like she always does. \n She\u2019s really good with teaching and training the dogs. Hell, she taught my shih tzu to push a yorkie around in a babydoll stroller. The yorkie would have a pacifier in its mouth and a bib on. The taught them to sleep in a baby dolls baby bed. She\u2019s taught them all kinds of little tricks. She really is quite good with the animals. The pup peeing on the floor or daughter not taking pup out doesn\u2019t happen a lot. Maybe daughter was just having a bad day ? That still does not excuse her demanding other peoples things just because hers got ruined.", "She didn\u2019t have to clean up dog pee, the coloring book absorbed it. She just had to wash her hands throughly after throwing the book away. No, I\u2019m not giving her something that she\u2019s demanding because she let hers get ruined.", "I agree they are totally age appropriate chores for a 10 year old! It's moreso that some parents get their young kid a pet and expect that kid to solely handle that responsibility.", "Hah, how expensive are coloring books these days? The ones I remember were a few bucks! Sounds like she will have a new one soon", "Easy NTA then.\n\nAs a child whose feelings were constantly invalidated I am very glad to see a parent who is patient and will listen to their child even when child in the wrong.\n\nGood job!", "She shouldn\u2019t be touching animal faeces at all! She\u2019s 10 not an adult that should be your job. And hey you asked if we thought you were TA and I think you are!", "It's not egregious, but she is still 10 and kids forget to do things and lack the impulse control and the brain development to fully think through the cause and effect of this while young means mom and dad need to be verifying the tasks related to animal care are being completely daily. \n\nSo yeah, don't replace the coloringbook, but make sure she did what she was supposed to do so your dog isn't also ruining your carpet and your floors.", "Also double check that everything is picked up off the floor, so many things are so, so dangerous for small pups. They don't know enough not to chew on and eat everything. My sister lost a pup because it chewed up kids toy and punctured it's intestine.", "Sounds like a good future reward is a new one of those coloring books after she takes care of her dog responsibilities for a week or two", "Just wanted to say something about the puppy. I know you said you never used puppy pads before. And from someone with experience,  you shouldn't be using them now. Your puppy is going to become dependent on those pads and is going to slow down the training process. If she knows she has somewhere inside to go pee, she isn't going to get used to letting you knownshe needs to go, or holding it a little bitnuntil she gets out. She's going to know she can go inside. And even when you remove the pads, especially if they are in the same place her smell is going to linger there. She will keep going back to that spot to pee. I bet the coloring book was probably close to where she normally puts the pads. I would cut the pads out entirely and tell your daughter the puppy cannot sleep with her until it is completely potty trained or else your going to be dealing with this for ever. And after awhile it can begin to effect your other dogs.", "I'm sure after this she will .  That's the natural consequence.", "Personally, I think that a new coloring book would be the perfect future reward the next time that a reward has been earned. Whether that\u2019s good grades or doing a good job at dog care and cleaning her room for X amount of time. But I agree that mom shouldn\u2019t replace it right now.", "That\u2019s one thing I\u2019m afraid of. One of my yorkies would chew on a linoleum rug. I thought he was just chewing because of teething but the little sucker was actually eating it. I know this because he pooped a linoleum turd."]}
