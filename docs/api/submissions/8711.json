Where you can come in is give her the opportunity to earn her a coloring book. Like, if she doesn't do dishes, tell her to do dishes for a month to earn the coloring book.

You mentioned in another comment that she knows all this stuff but was too lazy to do it.\n\nBut, I do want to touch on a few things\n- Puppies have small bladders and naturally just go more often than adult dogs. If the pup is sleeping in your daughter's room, is it being brought outside frequently enough (I assume your daughter goes to bed earlier than you, isn't getting up in the middle of the night, and probably wakes up after you). \n- Make sure you're rewarding her responsibility as much as letting her experience the consequences of her laziness. Maybe agree to a mother-daughter day or other reward once you all survive the potty training period\n- double check she has put out the potty pad before bed. At the end of the day, she's only 10 and still needs oversight. Two seconds of your time can save a huge headache.", "an already-trained dog is a big difference from a puppy that's still being trained.

The rigid rules.\n\nIt's understandable you gave her all the warning and that the rules were already laid out and so since she does get allowances, she can save up. But it's good to also humanize her and realize that people (especially young ones) are more prone to making mistakes, so I think an alternative route (if you can financially afford it) is to give her the opportunity for additional responsibilities above the ones that she already has.\n\nIt's like taking a class and the teacher says you need to do your homework and pass the exam. The rules are set, but it's kind of a nice feeling when the teacher says we have an opportunity to earn extra credit.\n\nGive her that \"extra credit\" opportunity where she has to do XYZ to earn her coloring book.", "Yes you are, the 2yo couldn't care less, you are just being vindictive. You can keep your precious pens and colouring book  don't worry. She'll learn, alright!", "She said that the 10 year old was supposed to take the dog out and didn't.

I also don't think putting the pee pad down should be all her responsibility. If she forgets, again, like children do, then you need to step up and put one down.

I know you said you never used puppy pads before. And from someone with experience,  you shouldn't be using them now. Your puppy is going to become dependent on those pads and is going to slow down the training process. If she knows she has somewhere inside to go pee, she isn't going to get used to letting you knownshe needs to go, or holding it a little bitnuntil she gets out. She's going to know she can go inside. And even when you remove the pads, especially if they are in the same place her smell is going to linger there. She will keep going back to that spot to pee. I bet the coloring book was probably close to where she normally puts the pads. I would cut the pads out entirely and tell your daughter the puppy cannot sleep with her until it is completely potty trained or else your going to be dealing with this for ever. And after awhile it can begin to effect your other dogs.", "I'm sure after this she will .  That's the natural consequence.", "Personally, I think that a new coloring book would be the perfect future reward the next time that a reward has been earned.

I especially like coloring mandalas.", "We do use different books to color in. I haven\u2019t stopped coloring with her completely.", "NTA. You\u2019re not being shitty towards your kid. Puppies are hard and so is parenting. Tbh I\u2019m insanely impressed that you have two young kids, multiple dogs, and a new pup. That\u2019s a ton of work and it sounds like you\u2019re going a great job. \n\nI agree with others that you have to start checking behind your daughter where the potty pads are concerned. Mostly because it\u2019s easier to do a two second check then clean up when one is forgotten. I know someone mentioned litter boxes but grass patches are also an option. Either fake or there\u2019s subscription services that\u2019ll send you little patches of real grass that get composed once they\u2019re done. I can\u2019t say that they\u2019re less gross than a potty pad (honestly they\u2019re probably the same) but many pups need an indoor spot until they\u2019re old enough to consistently make it outside (especially if you have multiple stories). \n\nThe dog should be crate trained because there\u2019s so many times when it\u2019ll come in handy. (Kid at school, visitors over, vet visits, family vacation, etc\u2026) Even if you don\u2019t use it throughout their life it helps puppies learn how to self soothe and be alone. Plus puppies need enforced nap times so having a designated space is helpful. If your kid is super against crates, could you do a play pen? There\u2019s some really nice ones that can fold away, have a waterproof floor for accidents, and mesh sides/open top so your daughter can still interact with the puppy. \n\nYour story is a great low stakes example of natural consequences for your kid. Thankfully it was just a coloring book. Hopefully the message was received and she\u2019ll be more careful about putting things away in the future. The pup could\u2019ve peed on an important homework assignment or eaten something really dangerous. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already had a discussion with your daughter but I would remind her when she gets a new coloring book. Put less emphasis on the damage done to her book and more on the potential hard that could come to the puppy if it eats something dangerous. Kids tend to have a lot of empathy so by putting it in the perspective that she needs to be careful what gets left out in order to keep the puppy safe (without blaming her for this mistake) she\u2019ll be more mindful in the future. This could also be a good Segway into teaching the leave it/drop it commands. \n\nIt seems like the coloring is an important time y\u2019all spend together. If you can, maybe print out some pages so y\u2019all can keep having that time until she gets a new book. Or use the time to train the pup together. Once she earns the money for a new one, I\u2019d take her somewhere special to buy it. (Ex: if you usually go to a book store take her to a craft store or vise versa)", "yes but the thing is that you can\u2019t tell your daughter it\u2019s her fault that the dog pees on her things, then get upset if the dog ends up peeing on YOUR things. it is a puppy after all. they pee everywhere if you don\u2019t keep them on a schedule. \n\nit\u2019s easy to offset the blame to your daughter, but the reality of the situation is that she\u2019s 10, her brain doesn\u2019t work the way yours does, and she probably needs some more guidance in taking care of the dog. she might not understand the gravity of what being a dog owner means. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to call your daughter entitled for being upset about encountering a consequence that she probably didn\u2019t think was going to happen. it might be more beneficial to sit down and have a chat with her and just let her express how she feels to you. it could even be deeper than the coloring book. she could be upset about the fact that you put the poster in her sibling\u2019s room, and may feel some resentment. bottom line though, just let her talk it out with you. maybe come up with a better plan for the dog. you just need to let her know that you hear what she\u2019s saying, and that you\u2019re willing to work with her towards a solution. \n\nNAH btw. shit happens sometimes.", "Oh okay fair enough \ud83d\udc4d", "If she keeps hustling me out this money she\u2019s gonna buy me one also !", "Thanks for the advice.

If I give in to her demands with this coloring book situation, what\u2019s next ? Tomorrow she wants to cut her sisters hair, do I give into that ? At 13, she wants a tattoo and hang out all hours of the night with her friends. If I say no, I\u2019m a shitty parents for denying her demands. If I say yes, I\u2019m a good parent because I gave in to those demands and my daughter isn\u2019t \u201csuffering\u201d.  Holy fuck. I\u2019ve had this parenting thing all wrong all along. I guess instead of saving for retirement,  we need to just spend that money on her wants and demands.", "Yes, I did ask and I thank you for your honesty.

If your already saying your having issues with the puppy, it might be that your tailoring the training a little too much towards a 10 year old. I get the whole \"you can have a dog if it's your responsibility\" thing, but let's be honest most 10 year Olds are not capable of properly training a puppy. You need to have a more active hand in things, then once the puppy is trained your daughter can take over the responsibilities of taking care of the dog. I promise if you don't get rid of the puppy pads you are setting back the potty training of the new puppy.", "I am very active with the pup training.

Setting a schedule  like that the pup will learn that she is willing to take her out at night and will start letting her know that she needs to go to the bathroom. If you didn't have other dogs it wouldn't be too big of a deal but especially since it was their home first they might start marking their territory in your daughter's room to make their smell predominant and that's going to set you adult dogs back.
