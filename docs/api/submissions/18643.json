From your comments, it seems your wife doesn't want to take money from her daughters college fund which is where she puts all her extra money in. Instead she expects you to drop one of your daughters activities to pay for hers. That's what I think isn't fair. It's not really that she doesn't have the money. It's that she puts her money elsewhere. Granted, it's totally admirable to put towards college, but it's not cool to expect others to go without so she doesn't have to pay. I also disagree with the \"of course your daughters life changed since you got married, so what does dropping something really matter?\" I would think consistency in other areas (like activities) would be important with the change in new step family adjustments. \n\nAlso, you said your step daughter has a dad, why isn't he paying? I don't think it should be up to you and your daughter to cover.", "Info :\n\n Before marrying how did you two discussed your finances? And how did you discussed the stepparenting part?", "INFO\n\nWhat do each of the girls want?\n\nDoes Zoey really like having her life this structured, or were you using activities as child care?  Would she enjoy having time to hang out with friends, or talk to them on the phone?\n\nDoes Annie want activities?  If so, of what sort?\n\nThe fact that Zoey \"has to\" do something all the time is concerning.  A person needs to be able to entertain themselves, on their own, not relying on structured activities all the time.\n\nAre there less expensive options for activities, for both Zoey and Annie, that would allow them to attend, say, a painting class at a different, less expensive, facility?", "YTA. Your description of Zoey is glowing. Annie? Notsomuch. I\u2019m sure Annie picks up on this. \n\nHave you ever thought that maybe Annie spends more time on her phone because she hasn\u2019t been given the opportunities to take classes like Zoey has? That should change. \n\nFinally, both kids have phones, but no one can afford one additional class. I\u2019ll never understand this thinking\u2026.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s expectations are not fair to your daughter.  Don\u2019t do it.  Zoey didn\u2019t get married.  If you do this expect anger and bitterness to rule the roost.

There is such a weird and uncomfortable they vs us mentality when OP comments. \"They\" being his **WIFE** and STEP**DAUGHTER.** Good lord man Annie is your daughter too, just as much as Zoey. She isn't some second class citizen. Serious communication about your finances needs to be done, because why are you spending a ton of money on Zoey but what I assume is non on Annie? \n\nReading this and OPs comments sickened me honestly.

What if it were your daughter who wanted to take an additional class? Could you afford it then? Does your wife face a forever-inferior position based on earnings due to a premarital agreement?\n\n It's a tough call and your future happiness depends on it quite a bit. Perhaps all of these things should have been discussed before you got married. How do the stepsisters feel about each other, and how do you expect this to affect everyone's happiness in this new living arrangement? So many questions, and it doesn't sound like your attitude is a winning one.", "As someone else posted, why can't your stepdaughter's father pay for the class?", "ESH.

Why do I get the feeling that birthdays and Christmases are going to be treated the same way?", "NTA- It sounds like you've explained why it wouldn't work. Since you both have discussed home finance issues and both of you seem aware of what the other is paying. It is unfair for her to ask you to remove one of your daughters activities to make room for a class for her daughter when she has some freed up money she can pay with. That's what's not okay. When blending families it's never okay to ask your partner to lessen  what their own child gets just so you can have it for your own.", "INFO is Annie interested in the class? It's not uncommon for teenagers and adults to get new hobbies or interests. It isn't fair to sign Annie up for a class that she may not even be interested if it means Zooey has to drop a class.

A stepparent should treat their stepkid with love and care for them and be there for them, but it's not the same thing as his own child.
