From your comments, it seems your wife doesn't want to take money from her daughters college fund which is where she puts all her extra money in. Instead she expects you to drop one of your daughters activities to pay for hers. That's what I think isn't fair. It's not really that she doesn't have the money. It's that she puts her money elsewhere. Granted, it's totally admirable to put towards college, but it's not cool to expect others to go without so she doesn't have to pay. I also disagree with the \"of course your daughters life changed since you got married, so what does dropping something really matter?\" I would think consistency in other areas (like activities) would be important with the change in new step family adjustments. \n\nAlso, you said your step daughter has a dad, why isn't he paying? I don't think it should be up to you and your daughter to cover.", "Info :\n\n Before marrying how did you two discussed your finances? And how did you discussed the stepparenting part?", "INFO\n\nWhat do each of the girls want?\n\nDoes Zoey really like having her life this structured, or were you using activities as child care?  Would she enjoy having time to hang out with friends, or talk to them on the phone?\n\nDoes Annie want activities?  If so, of what sort?\n\nThe fact that Zoey \"has to\" do something all the time is concerning.  A person needs to be able to entertain themselves, on their own, not relying on structured activities all the time.\n\nAre there less expensive options for activities, for both Zoey and Annie, that would allow them to attend, say, a painting class at a different, less expensive, facility?", "YTA. Your description of Zoey is glowing. Annie? Notsomuch. I\u2019m sure Annie picks up on this. \n\nHave you ever thought that maybe Annie spends more time on her phone because she hasn\u2019t been given the opportunities to take classes like Zoey has? That should change. \n\nFinally, both kids have phones, but no one can afford one additional class. I\u2019ll never understand this thinking\u2026.", "NTA. Your wife\u2019s expectations are not fair to your daughter.  Don\u2019t do it.  Zoey didn\u2019t get married.  If you do this expect anger and bitterness to rule the roost.

There is such a weird and uncomfortable they vs us mentality when OP comments. \"They\" being his **WIFE** and STEP**DAUGHTER.** Good lord man Annie is your daughter too, just as much as Zoey.

Serious communication about your finances needs to be done, because why are you spending a ton of money on Zoey but what I assume is non on Annie? \n\nReading this and OPs comments sickened me honestly.

Does your wife face a forever-inferior position based on earnings due to a premarital agreement?\n\n It's a tough call and your future happiness depends on it quite a bit.

A stepparent should treat their stepkid with love and care for them and be there for them, but it's not the same thing as his own child.

Why does Annie suddenly feel the need for extracurricular activities?? Or is this coming from your wife? I say NTA. It doesn't make sense to me that Annie suddenly NEEDs extra classes. I don't agree with people say you are the AH because you're treating the girls differently. First of all.. there is a level of love and respect to be assumed when you gain a step child but of course it's not going to be equal to the love and care you have put into your own child. Maybe that's an unpopular opinion but there's no reason zoe needs to suffer by foregoing her usual routine and activities so that Annie can suddenly start activities when she was never interested in the first place.

You can care about and for someone without unilaterally establishing a father-daughter relationship. Which you don't seem to want him to do anyway. He has certain responsibilities, yes, but it is not the same relationship he has with his daughter. Both in terms of relationship length and reciprocity. It just...isn't fair to tell him \"you have a daughter\" while telling said daughter \"you've got a bigger wallet now\".\n\n>Anne had no say in having a step father.\n\nA decent parent would discuss marriage with their child and work out the expected relationship the child will have with the spouse.", "> As the step parent you are obligated to treat the step child the same as your child.\n\nSo, ground her, decide when she's old enough to date or learn to drive, send her to your mother for a few weeks in the summer, have her convert to your religion and attend events your child attends, have an opinion on where and what she should study, walk her down the aisle at her wedding, make her give up her pet if your child doesn't have one...right?", "As a stepparent your only obligation is to be kind, to be civil but there is no financial obligation to your step child. \n\nThe people financially responsible for the child are the biological parents."]}
