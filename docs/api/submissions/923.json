It must suck getting hurt by words not said.", "NTA - If your parents are not willing to pay them speak with your sister that you expect her to work to pay you back ie babysitting, getting a part time job etc. it\u2019s not your fault that it broke and it is her responsibility to fix what she created. And maybe stop being so lenient on allowing her to utilize your expensive things. I know 14 is not that old but she\u2019s old enough to be more careful.", "That depends. Are you currently living with your parents? If so, are you paying rent?\n\nIf you are and paying rent, you're not the asshole. Your sister should be paying to repair your Switch or buy a new one.\n\nIf you're living with them and not payjng rent, then yes, you're the asshole since you're an adult living under their roof for free. Thems the breaks, learn your lesson and don't let your sister use your stuff. She clearly cannot be trusted.\n\nIf you're not living with your parents, I question how your sister is able to access your Switch, but yes, your sister or parents should pay for your busted Switch.", "INFO: If your sister broke it, why isn't she paying for it? Even if she has to borrow money from your parents to do so.", "Your sister should have to pay for all of it tbh. She broke it. Also she old enough to have responsibilities. Since your sister probably has no money you parents should pay for the whole thing and they should probably ground your sister. Also, switch is not a toy. I'm older than you and don't consider it a toy and I've already seen people in their 60's comment it isn't either if you needed any more proof.", "NTA the punishment needs to go to your sister though.  She needs to work off the damages even if it can't be in the form of financial payment.  Tell her she needs to clean out your car and errands totaling the damage.", "NTA. Your sister should absolutely be held responsible. If she doesn\u2019t have the money, then it\u2019s on your parents (since she\u2019s still a child) to replace things she breaks.", "NTA. Your parents are mean. They should have at the very least given you something. Also your sister should have gotten some sort of punishment.", "Your sister is old enough to know better and your parents are copping out. I\u2019d be pissed as well.", "Nta. At fourteen she knows to Be responsible.", "OP, \n\nim not going to post judgement but i want to shed a light on a sudden change in your sister's behavior and a sudden shift from her having a proven and good track record. I am concerned since your sister knows she needs to keep clean hands on your switch, how come she failed to do this twice in a row? \n\nwhat's going on here? is this a cry for help? is she getting bullied by her friend? is the friend boundary stomping on her and she doesn't know how to speak out and is shameful? \n\nit seems to me there's more here than the surface issues and perhaps you should have a talk with your sister in a more friendly tone to figure out if she needs \"big brother support\" from you on something.", "My boyfriend has a Switch, we have two toddlers that have put that thing through hell. The only damage it\u2019s sustained is a single broken joycon and that was from being dropped on tile. \nNTA", "NTA, but your parents are also not required to pay for your toys. When you DO buy another switch, do not let ANYONE borrow it. If sister asks to play on your switch, hand her the broken one and say, \u201csure\u2026 keep it as long as you like.\u201d NEVER again let her use anything of yours that can break. Be as PETTY as you need to be to get the message across.\n\nAlso\u2026 you\u2019re 19. Start looking for a way to not live with your parents anymore. Adults do not look at their grown children as adults when you\u2019re still living in their home. If you want to be respected, step one will be to become independent (as much as possible). This could be living in dorms at your school?", "NTA. She broke it, she\u2019s required to help you replace it. That\u2019s basic decency and logic.", "NTA \n\nPlus keep us updated", "Your sister broke the switch and should pay for half the cost to replace the same model. So, whatever a two-year-old switch would cost divided in half. If your sister is not able to pay then your parents, as her legal guardians, should absolutely pay. If she'd done that to a stranger's switch they'd definitely be paying and probably for all of it. If nobody helps you replace the switch then explain to your sister that she can no longer use it and put it somewhere she can't have access to it anymore. Not sure why your parents are being hardasses about this but it's not worth continuing to argue with them because you'll just end up angry and frustrated with no change on their part. They should really be holding your sister accountable for being irresponsible.", "NTA -- It would be nice if your parents could \"front\" you the money and then take it out of your sister's allowance (assuming she gets one) since she is responsible for the damage.  Also, as a parent, I would be a bit proud that I had a son so willing to share his expensive toys with his younger sister. You're a good big bother and I'm sorry the old \"no good deed goes unpunished\" idiom reared it's ugly head on you in this situation.", "Uhh  .... Yes you're absolutely the ahole. You can't expect them to help you get a new gift because you yourself put your trust in your sister and she broke it. No if anyone gona pay a new one it's your sister. And she should pay for it all. \n\nYour parents aren't obligated to pay jacked *** because you decided to let someone borrow your things that's all on you. \n\nEither have your sister pay, or get over it, but you can not expect your parents to pay at all. And if your sister can't pay well then it sucks because you should've thought of worst case scenarios which ofc is hard. But you can't expect your parents to pay for a accident your sister does. And you can't pull the card \" Sister destroyed my switch so you parents have to pay for her\" No just no, rather I decided to take my trust and loan it to someone who can't work and earn money yet so I have to swallow my mistake and learn for the next time. \n\nIt's not your parents fault that YOU decided to let someone else without financial income play with it and drops it.\n\nAnd if it had a crack it sounds as if she slammed it and lost or something because I have a switch which I dropped plenty of times from the tv bench without a mark. And when you do get a new never give it for someone to use when you're not home again. \n\nSolution: Talk to your parents so all her allowance goes to you for a new console to make up for the damage.\n\nBecause this is smth they are obligated to do due well they're the legal guardians and like someone else said if your child break something at someones place you always replace and repay as the legal guardian. \nEither they pay for it all straight away, or monthly installation through the sisters allowance", "Do you or your parents have insurance? That might cover it.", "NTA but I'd just buy it on your own and keep it locked when when you're not home.", "NTA.  They are responsible for any damage caused by their minor child.  Simple as that.", "NTA\n\nDoes your sister get an allowance or some kind of income, as she damaged it she should pay for it.\nMaybe she should offer to do chores to pay for it", "If they won't replace it ( maybe they plan to buy you a knew one for Christmas we don't know ) buy a dead bolt for your room and a lock ... put this lock visible and say thst since they won't replace anything your sister brakes no one is allowed near your stuff because you can't afford to constantly replace things thst she brakes make sure it's a proper eye sore too", "NTA gotta love a parent that the concept of parental responsibility is totally lost on.", "NTA \n\nYour parents are assholes. When you get your new DO NOT let your sister borrow it.", "NAH. You asked. They said no. Your parents have more to figure into their financial decisions than expensive toys. Your parents may make decisions that you do not understand or disagree with at 19. It sucks that it broke, but toys break. \n\nI swear, this sub is full of kids who never grew up.", "Mild YTA. Your parents didn't break the switch, your sister did. Info: how close to 15 is she? Depending on where you live, she may be able to get a job. Tell her she has 6 months to get a job and enough money to pay for the repair, otherwise you'll start charging heavy interest. Like, 5%/month compounding until she pays it off.", "YTA, your parents have nothing to do with it. Your sister should pay you for it via allowance, birthday or xmas money. Also don't let her use your stuff again.", "True but there are those people that even if their kid destroyed something they don\u2019t think they have to replace it. Maybe laying out what they would do if daughter destroy someone else\u2019s item but I suspect they would answer the same.", "Plus if the sisters friend broke it, I suggest you demand the details from your sister so you can take them to small claims court. This will at least poison your sisters social circle of she or your parents refuse to pay.", "Love reading this comment", "Cool, then NTA. Your sister is a minor and the damages she makes to others' properties is their responsibility. I'd actually expect them to make up for the whole thing given that you contribute that much around the house.\n\nCould your sister maybe do some of the chores for allowance, so she can contribute to paying you back for what she broke?", "That's awesome.   Congratulations on sobriety!", ":)", "Yeah, it's not  that much.", "Your parents sound abusive making you pay rent at 17. Just because your parents were abusive doesn't his should be. He is 19 that is perfectly reasonable to live rent free at parents house. If you were to say 30 that's a different story. But 19 is basically still a child", "If someone destroys your property you are legally entitled to compensation. If that someone is a minor then the guardian must do it. You can 100% go to a small claims court over this", "this specifically fucks up the turnips. The buying was only part of it though, the having to check turnip prices every half day in between sundays made it feel even more like a job. \n\nand also I didn't want to.", "I'm not saying they should make him pay rent. I'm saying he has the benefit right now of NOT having to pay rent, and the benefit of his parents spending money on his upkeep, as they should, but I think with that in mind he should buy the replacement with the extra income those benefits give him, plus whatever help his sister can give"]}
