My mom has even taken her in for months at a time when we were kids because she\u2019d run away from whatever house she was living in at the time and come to us. My parents are divorced and I lived with my mom while my older brother Jack( 30m) lived with dad, so I was never super close with Jack growing up. Kylie was basically my sister and my mom\u2019s second daughter. We ended up going to the same schools and have been best friends for most of our lives.\n\nJack never really paid attention to us when we were kids because we were his annoying little sister and her little friend, but in our early 20s, Jack and Kylie started dating. I was super against it at first because I knew it was not gonna be good, but they promised that even if it doesn\u2019t work out it, it wouldn\u2019t hurt our friendship. They dated for three years and was engaged for a year, but they broke it off because there were compatibility differences (no one cheated or anything wild). It was a tough break up for both but they moved on with their lives. They still saw each other at family events because Kylie was always invited and they just kept a distance but other than that it was fine.\n\nNow this thanksgiving, my brother, who got married recently, brought along his new wife to dinner at our mom\u2019s house. Kylie was in attendance too. I\u2019ve met my brother\u2019s wife but she\u2019s never been to any of the holiday stuff the last few years because of covid and a few other things, and they also live a few states away (they\u2019re moving back to our hometown next year). After thanksgiving dinner, my brother told me that his wife was extremely uncomfortable when she found out Kylie was also at our dinner and she is still always included in our family events. He said he knows it\u2019s gonna be hard but his new wife is now my family too so out of respect for her he wants me to not bring Kylie, who is an outsider, around much anymore when they\u2019re around\u2026which will be almost every family events since him and his wife are moving back soon. I\u2019ve known his wife for mere two years but ive known Kylie for 20 years\u2026.she is NOT an outsider. He even had the BALLS to suggest that maybe I shouldn\u2019t invite Kylie, who is THE MAID OF HONOR, to my upcoming wedding next year and if I do then he and his wife might not come anymore. I told him I will not stop inviting her and that he promised their dating history wont come between our friendship so he gotta figure it out himself with his wife. My mom, who host all our family function, is staying out of it because this is between her actual son and her unofficial daughter, she\u2019s just sad but staying out of it.

His wife needs help and reassurance and possibly some maturity and empathy to better understand the context and why Kylee was a part of your family long before she dated, got engaged to, and then broke up with your brother, and she will always be important to you and your mom and vice versa. It\u2019s cruel of your brother to put you and your family and Kylee in this position. He needs to own up to his promise and if he needs to get into therapy with his new wife to help her understand and help the two of them work through it, tick tock\u2026\n\nIf your brother and his wife can\u2019t work through this and get over themselves, they can spend the holidays with her family or do separate holidays. I hope that with a lot more context, background, and empathy, your new sister-in-law will chill out and your brother will stop being horrible about this.", "NTA. That\u2019s an awkward situation and I feel bad for your brother\u2019s wife but she\u2019s going to have to figure out how to get over it. Your brother said he wouldn\u2019t let his relationship with Kylie change your friendship with her - he needs to stick to his word.", "NTA. But I also wish you the best for this situation, because it is going to be hard to navigate. I completely get your SILs concern. I would find it really uncomfortable to go to family events, and find out my partner's ex-fiance is there too. But also, this is Kylie and your brother's problem to address. Not just your brother's, Kylie's too. No matter what, this will be shit for you. But both your brother and Kylie put that risk on you when they started dating. Really you and your SIL are the innocent ones in this situation. \n\nFor your wedding, of course keep Kylie as your MOH. Your SIL and brother can sort that one out.

However, that being said, if they choose to not attend gatherings where Kylie is invited that's their decision.\n\nThey can either accept that Kylie and Jack's relationship ended amicably, and move forward as adults, or they can choose to make it awkward.\n\nPart of me wonders if the real reason this has suddenly become a stopping block is if Jack has had second thoughts and regrets now that he's married.  Perhaps things aren't amazing at home, and SiL is worried about having the ghost of fiancees past around?\n\nEither way, Kylie has been more involved in your mom's life than Jack has.  Let him do the holidays with Dad instead.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour relationship with Kylie is just as important to you as his relationship with his wife is to him.

You and your mom consider her family and your brother is only saying she's an outsider now because of his wife.\n\nI've never understood why current partners have problems with the ex.  He didn't choose the ex, he chose the wife, and if Kylie can deal with seeing the person he decided to build a life with I'm sure the wife can deal with the person he doesn't love anymore.", "NTA.

You said their break-up wasn't dramatic or over anything significant other than irreconcilable differences, essentially, so he and his wife need to accept that he moved on with her (the wife), and Kylie is fine without him, and everyone needs to just coexist for the time being, and eventually everyone will be okay with it.\n\nThe elephant will get smaller as the years go on, but Kylie shouldn't be discluded.", "OP you're simply NTA because you're willing to stand up for a long-term friendship and refuse to kowtow to people who just simply cannot face the reality of acting like mature adults and accept the fact that people have had intimate relationships before their current ones and will have them afterwards as well.

Life is too short to be wasting such bad energy on family like this.", "NTA he can\u2019t just change everything and blindside everyone. He also probably hid this from his wife.

It must be uncomfortable but he shat in his own nest and now he can deal with the consequences. As a guest, your brother has no right to complain about who the host decided to invite. If he wants control of the guest list, he can host. If he\u2019s not hosting, he can decide to attend or not, just as he pleases. Same goes for your wedding.", "NTA\n\nKylie is a family member.  Was before your brother chose to date her and PROMISE nothing would change and she remains so after the relationship failed. This isn't a situation of you got close to his girlfriend and now just want to keep her around. She has literally lived with you and your mom growing up and she is FAMILY through and through. PERIOD!\n\nNope NTA, not even a little. \n\nThe brother, AH++ \n\nThe wife....jury is out yet on her, but I think she just doesn't actually know the real background and just your brothers sob story about how is ex comes to family gatherings still. \n\nI can't even imagine how upsetting this is for Kylie.

It's the dichotomy of a good husband or good brother. No good husband should want to or would want to place their wife into an uncomfortable position and tell them to get over it repeatedly. Infact this server daily bashes husbands for this. Alternately he has to effectively punish his wife for ever to be a good brother. If he chooses his wife which he should as they are married OP is effectively telling him to cut them all off which if he is a good husband he will.

Or somthing bad did happen and now one or both regrets it. And wifey can sense that if that bridge mends she has no hope of keeping him. Either way is basically torture for the Sil.

But I slapped the prune on the table, and asked her if we should clear the air, she agreed. \n\nNow we usually sit next to eachother at familystuff with my in-laws. So.. I say, bro\u2019s wife should just get the awkward conversation out of the world, and then just try and coexists in the same space with the ex. If she can\u2019t, she should go work on her insecurity.\n\nUnless Kylie actually do want bro back, but it doesn\u2019t Sound like that\u2019s the case", "Not saying it\u2019s right, but there\u2019s another option too, the brother and SIL don\u2019t accept it and just don\u2019t come anymore.", "I mean, people can split up and co-parent civilly, he should grow up and deal with her in a civil manner, too. He needs to reassure his wife that they are both over their relationship and that she has been his sister's best friend for the main part of their lives. K. is not attending as the pining ex unable to move on, she's there as his sisters friend and honorary daughter!", "Possible. But if grandma doesn't want that, then maybe she needs to do some mediating here and not just leave it to her kids to work out among themselves.", "Totally agree."]}
