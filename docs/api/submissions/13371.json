Our park has one of those zip line rides, which is my daughter's favorite so she immediately ran to ride it.

My daughter apologised profusely and said it was an accident and she didn't see him, but the mom scolded her for not paying attention and said she seriously injured the kid. My daughter started crying and I felt like the mom was being too aggressive, especially saying the kid was \"seriously injured\" since he didn't have a scratch on him, so I stepped in and told the woman not to yell at my kid over a simple accident. She said I'm a lazy mom for not teaching my kid to pay better attention and my daughter's too big to be playing on the playground as it is. Those words triggered something in me and I lost my temper. I called her a bitch for talking to a child like that over an accident and said that maybe if she'd been watching her toddler more carefully, this wouldn't have happened. She stormed off and I took my daughter home immediately. She cried the whole drive, and when we got home she went to her room. I came in to talk to her about what happened, and she said that what the woman said hurt but I was worse because I embarrassed her by \"being a Karen.\" I have to admit I was a bit shocked to hear that, I thought she'd be glad that I defended her.

And is there an age limit on the playground or was the woman being nasty? Ive certainly been to playgrounds that were limited to kids 8 and under, but if there\u2019s no limit than yeah your daughter is just as entitled to be there as her kid. \n\nEither way, the mom should teach her kid not to run through that area, but your daughter\u2019s embarrassment makes me wonder if she knows she could\u2019ve been more careful, and thus your reaction felt over the top to her. \n\nThe 2 year old shouldn\u2019t walk through a zip line path, and your daughter should make sure it\u2019s clear before she begins her descent, both those things can be true and it seems like your daughter realizes it.", "Just explain to her the difference between a Karen (someone who is being prejudice and rude on purpose) and someone standing up to a bully which is what you did.", "I'm stuck on being too big for the playground at 9 y/o.  Perhaps she is also the type of mother that gives her 2 yr old a tablet as a babysitter.  I mean, come on, 9!  \nThat \"something\" that unleashed in you is called the mama bear in all of us mothers.  Definitely NTA", "YTA  \n\n\nFor letting your 9 year old have tiktok. FFS.", "ESH, except the children. That is NOT the way to behave, or speak, in front of a child. Learn to control your mouth.", "NTA. 2 year old shouldn\u2019t be in an area that is above his age limlt", "NTA, as far as I know ziplines don't come with breaks, so idk what she was expecting your daughter to do to stop.", "NTA. Your daughter was embarrassed and is projecting that on you. Don't feel bad about it, but an apology will smooth it over with her and then you can move on.  To be clear - you didn't do anything wrong and don't need to apologise, it will just make your daughter feel better.", "NTA. We had a swing in our garden. One time the neighbors toddler ran towards me and I kicked him in the face.", "NTA, the boy shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place. Mum should\u2019ve looked if she was so concerned about her son\u2019s well being.", "NTA. My mom wouldn\u2019t of gotten angry lol she would of looked at us and said \u201cyou learn your lesson?\u201d. We had a zip line in my grandma\u2019s backyard and sometimes we would run through it and lots of times got kicked.", "NTA. Is it even possible to stop in the middle of zip lining? They don't have brakes. The mother shouldn't have allowed her toddler into the path of the zip lining. I think trying to stop mid way through would cause injuries.", "NTA. Your kid got 10 points.", "You stand up for your kid. You need to be an AH to deal with a B. It\u2019s necessary", "ESH. Your anger is understandable, but your reaction clearly affected your daughter beyond just embarrassing her.", "ESH - The other mother should be more observant and careful with letting her toddler run around in a park. I don't imagine with a Zipline you can do much to stop it once in motion, so your daughter is blameless here.\n\nHowever, defend your child by all means, but you need to be a role model. Swearing in front of children doesn't demonstrate that. I don't imagine it's easy to remain calm and objective enough, but your child is learning behaviours from you.", "NTA, you were a lot nicer than I would've been", "NTA. I would have done the same thing.", "NTA. She was on a Zipline, she can't just stop. The mother of a toddler should be keeping her kid out of the Zipline path. My youngest got hit by a Zipline when he was around 3. You know what I did? Made sure he was okay and then told him that's why I kept telling him not to run through there. I have three kids, lost track of that one for a minute. He's been careful of Zipline and swing paths since. That mom is trying to raise a spoiled child.", "NTA. Your kid couldn't have stopped the zipline. It wasn't her fault. Other Mom should have watched her kid around the zipline. I get that 2 year olds are deceptively fast, but that was still her responsibility as a parent if she needed someone to blame. Sometimes shit happens. It seems like an accident all around that the other mother turned into a bigger deal than it needed to be. Good on you for standing up for your child.", "ESH. I remember when my two year old got rocked by a zip liner. Accidents happen Toddlers are quicker than cheetah. It\u2019s no one\u2019s fault but you two adults were not setting a very good example and you kept escalating the situation. Kill them with kindness", "It's hard to know who was at fault for the collision. Probably no one as they are kids and this kind of shit happens all the time at play grounds. But neither you or the other mom acquitted yourselves well. Moms get upset when their kids get hurt but she took it too far. Then you lost your cool and called her a bitch in front of the kids. Not the best example. Even if what you said was \"just\" I think it's important to set the best example for our kids.\n\nESH.", "Of course YTA for calling a mother a bitch in front of 2 children. This is inappropriate behavior. It\u2019s fine to defend your kid, but learn how to do it like a grownup so you can model appropriate behavior for your child. This was out of line. No wonder your child was embarrassed.", "NAH. I honestly get both sides. The toddler mom was very upset because her child got hit by another one. But I see your side too if she went over the top with it after your daughter had apologized.", "Nope. You weren\u2019t the Karen in this situation. \nNTA", "NTA in general but calling the woman names didn't set a good example for your daughter in conflict resolution. I think it'd be a good opportunity for you to apologize to your daughter for how you acted and explain how it should have been handled, but that you aren't sorry for standing up for her just the way you did it.", "NTA I think the worst thing the other woman said was that your daughter was too old to play  in the park. She is absolutely young enough to play in the park, zip lines are for children her age and older. This is potenitally damaging for your daughter, because girls often get pressured out of taking part in physical activity, leading to health problems later in life. I think there should be playgrounds for teeagers and adults.", "Explain to your kid that you wouldn't take shit from that woman. She tried to shift the blame for that collision on your daughter, while there's not much she could've done to avoid him whilst riding a bloody zip line.\n\nNTA. That mother should've paid more attention to her toddler in order to prevent the incident. And then to go off on your daighter like that whilst she apologised for a mistake she didn't even make!\n\nAlmost twenty-five years ago, I was at this park with my brother and mother. There was this big, wave-y slide and alongside of it, a mother was snapping photos of her husband and children coming down. Meanwhile, she had a stroller with a toddler in it. He wasn't strapped in, so he got up and walked over to the stairs in order to ride the slide. His mother was oblivious, so *my* mother drew her attention to the fact that her little boy was escaping. She immediately responded by grabbing the lil' fella and sitting him bag down in the stroller. She thanked my mother, explained that he wasn't strapped in, *teeheehee*.\n\nAnd went back to snapping pictures.\n\nAnd the kid escaped again.\n\nAnd this time, no one warned her. Not sure how that ended, unfortunately. But both that mother, as well as the Arsehole mum of that toddler, had full responsibility for their kids.", "NTA you were completely right, she didn\u2019t watch her kid and he ran where he shouldn\u2019t.\n\nYou kid did nothing wrong, indeed she acted very mature and kindly by apologizing for something that truly was out of her control and Not her fault. \n\nTell her that someone on the opposite side of the world thinks she\u2019s a good kid.", "I'd disown my daughter", "NTA my heart is constantly in my mouth when I take my daughter to the park. The amount of kids that just wander in front of her when she's on the swing is staggering. Again, the momentum isn't something you can just stop so they're going to get hit. Thankfully it hasn't happened yet but I've taught my daughter from day 1, never walk closely in front of or behind swings.\n\nIt does sound like the other mother was panic blaming. I'd have done the same as you though and roared in defence.", "NTA why is your daughter being a brat about it", "In what world is a 9 year old \u2018too big\u2019 to be playing at the park?", "NTA. You just lost your temper\u2026.that\u2019s perfectly human. It sounds like she absolutely overreacted. It\u2019s impossible to stop mid-zip-wire so the onus was on the mother to stop her child from running in the way. If someone tried to embarrass my son like that, although I\u2019d like to keep my cool, I wouldn\u2019t beat myself up if I let \u2018bitch\u2019 slip out.\nYour daughter will come round, she\u2019s probably still really smarting from the embarrassment and being made the centre of an argument. You didn\u2019t start it.", "NTA. She should have been paying closer attention to her child and a 9 yr old isn't too old for a playground. I do think you need to have a talk with your daughter about standing up for yourself thou. Standing up for yourself or someone else doesn't make you a Karen. Adults shouldn't be bullying anyone much less a child. Then explain to her that a Karen is someone who makes a scene WITHOUT REASON. Someone who is disrespectful and rude because they're not getting their way. She definitely doesn't need to get the idea in her head that standing up for yourself or someone else = Karen. This speaks of her self confidence level and I know you can fix this Mama. You've got this! She just has the wrong impression of what a Karen is and should never equate being quiet and making herself smaller as the right way to do things to avoid being labeled \"Karen\". It's okay to speak up, take up space, be loud, stand your ground. None of that is Karen behavior.", "NTA. It was a typical playground accident. I've seen little kids run in front of swings, zip lines, climb up slides as someone is going down, etc etc etc so many times. It's kind of a kid thing. This woman made it into something way more than that. You called her for exactly what she is.", "ESH. The other mom was in the wrong. But so were you. You wanted your daughter to be grateful you called someone a bitch? That's not what she needed. What she needed was for you to remove her from the situation and focus on her by assuring her she didn't do anything wrong. You cussing out the other mom was about you and your feelings, not your daughter. \n\nI have a mom like that and I always hated it when she behaved like that when I was a kid. All that type of behavior did was embarrass me on top of whatever else was going on. And it always felt like it was more about her than it was about defending me. It never made me feel loved.", "Definitely not TA. It was just the swearing that undermined you. But you were definitely not in the wrong.", "This isn\u2019t about which mom is at fault. It is about how OP handled the situation and embarrassed her daughter. \n\nYTA, , What kind of example are you?  You didn\u2019t need to use foul language. In fact you didn\u2019t need to engage with the mother at all after telling her to not yell at your child, you could have walked away. \n\nAt least your daughter already has a good head on her shoulders to know you were inappropriate.", "ESH. I also have an insane 2yo, so I know the drill. Mom should have been watching them. You need to curb your anger though. It wasn't bad enough of an incident to justify cursing in front of kids/ at a playground. \n\nGlad to see you're self reflecting on it and your daughter feels comfortable enough to level with you.", "Exactly. Let\u2019s say it was a swing instead of a zip line. We all know the person at fault is the one who runs in front of the swing, not the person on a swing who often physically cannot stop themself in time.", "So much this! My older 2 LOVE those zip lines, but my little guy also loves to just run under them. I literally have to grab him and move him to the toddler side of the park because I know it's bad news.", "I greatly dislike how being called a karen is such a deep insult. It\u2019s meant to put women in their place and from acting out, and it\u2019s frankly scary that a 9 year old is learning that.", "Second this, I had this exact thing happen at work when i was rolling something I couldn't see over and some woman let her kid run in front of me. \n\nI apologized profusely of course but she looked at me like I was the devil. Unfortunately, I couldn't say anything because I wanted to keep my job! Lol", "First as someone who has been responsible for young kids at a playground you let them play. You don't hover over top of them. Yes if they are climbing up to high or playing rough you intervene but you can't preempt everything they do. That doesn't alleviate the other moms responsibility but saying she should have prevented it isn't totally realistic IMO.\n\nSecond, ensuring the coast is clear before zipping is largely the responsibility of the person zip lining (similar to pool diving boards and slides--you don't jump till the coast is clear). \n\nThird, given that 2 year olds don't cover a lot of ground quickly given their tiny legs, and a playground zip line is likely no more than 15 feet or so, I'd guess the 2 year old was within 3 or 4 feet of the kill zone and rapidly moving towards it when OPs daughter took off. OP says her daughter was excited. I have little doubt that she should NOT have zipped when she did.\n\nThis isn't to pin blame on OPs kid--it was an accident--but I can see why the other mom was upset. She was wrong to lash out though. But more importantly, I think all the posts putting this squarely on the 2 year old and their mom are misguided.\n\nTo me this is a E S H or N A H situation.", "I don\u2019t get parents that take their kids to the park, but absolutely refuse to accept any sort of accidents. Kids can\u2019t run, they can\u2019t climb, they can\u2019t do anything that would even remotely entail them getting somewhat hurt. I can\u2019t stand it.", "I really hate how the term \u201cKaren\u201d has evolved.", "Have you ever tried this method of communication in theory? If you're already talking to someone who's unreasonably angry, why would calm communication solve anything? The issue is the other party isn't *willing* to participate in healthy communication. The other mom was harassing *a child* in public, over an accident that was her own fault. It's not as simple as this.", "Honestly I think the OP sucks because she took her kid home right away (while crying the whole way) for doing nothing wrong.", "I am shocked at the amount of NTA votes and comments\u2026 people suck.", "how is the kid supposed to stop herself while on a zipline? would you rather she just let go and potentially hurt herself instead?", ">Seriously. Why was she letting her 2 year old run through a zip line path? Sounds like classic anger displacement. Stupid mother, but not a boitch.\n\nUntil she started screaming at a 9 year old child.", "Honestly, as someone who does boulder climbing, I see lots of parents let their kids run in dangerous places and ways. Either they have no idea how dangerous things are, or they don't care...", "Its honestly ridiculous how often I need to shoo other people\u2019s kids away from the front of the swing my kid is on at the park. Some parents just dont pay attention at all.", "I mean, the daughter expressed that by calling the mom a name. OP is fine and her reaction was fair given the circumstance, but should probably look at her kid's social media (if any) and talk to her about the whole Karen thing so she doesn't think you can't stand up for yourself (or your loved ones) without automatically being a bad person.", "Well when the shoe fits ...", "DON'T let a 9yo use tiktok please!! \nShe's a child and tiktok is full of bad bad bad things, please!", "The age limit on Tik Tok is 13 for a reason. Your daughter and her friends too young to be on any social media outlet and it has long lasting effects on their mental state. NTA for the situation above but YTA for letting her be on the wide open internet.", "She\u2019s *nine!* why would you let her use TikTok? There\u2019s a *lot* of shit on there that isn\u2019t appropriate for kids. I don\u2019t even let my nine year old watch YouTube.", "Btw ypu weren't being a Karen sp maybe teach the kid what a real Karen is", "Dude no. Get her off of there.", "Oh, so it\u2019s merely a coincidence that a currently viral tiktok has this exact scenario?", "So that woman actually made a very good point about you. YTA", "Yes \u201cKaren\u201d is just another word for \u201cbitch\u201d, female aimed derogatory, please correct this.", "Yeah, no one talks like that in real life.", "Seriously? What is there to \u201csolve\u201d or accomplish? You think anything said is going to make the other person come to some wild revelation and behavior change?  Like, \u201cyou know what, I am a bitch and shouldn\u2019t have done that. I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m going to take my crying toddler away from this area now and ponder how ensure neither of us end up in this situation again. Thank you!\u201d \n\nEngaging and escalating the situation to the point of getting into a cussing fight at the playground - in front of children - is ridiculous, uncalled for in 99/100 situations, accomplishes nothing and is terrible behavior to model to children. De-escalating and modeling emotional regulation and maturity is how adults/good parents would handle this\u2026", "From how OP described it, the girl hit the boy directly after start. The toddler therefore was close to her. This is part of growing up, be aware of your suroundings. If she had looked properly, she would not have started because there was this toddler.\n\nThen again she ist still only 9. Yelling at her is definitely not the way to go. Also the girl had a feeling it was her fault, she apologized immediately. If the girl would be my Kid, i would ask her to apologize to them. Then I would sit down with her and explain, that this was an unfortunate accident, but could have been avoided with looking around before using the zip line. She made a mistake, yes, but we all make mistakes and then take the responsibility. In her case \"I am sorry I hit you, I hope it is nothing serious, i will be more careful in the future.\n\nOf course I would also say to the other women, that she is out of line.", "Yep, pretty much. Sometimes the hard way is the only way kids learn.", "I'm not on Tik Tok, and only hear about trends when they make it onto the news after someone lands in hospital.  What's the trend about?", "I had no idea having kids destroyed your ability to clearly express basic thoughts /s \n\nThese replies are weird, this is is exactly how I talk, especially when stressed. The angrier I am the more likely it is to come out this way.", "Sorry, but that isn't at all true. I have spent a lot of time in therapy (which I think most people could use), and I am in a 12 year relationship in which we have had one single fight the entire time. My partner has also been to therapy. We are excellent communicators. In part because we talk to each other like normal people, partners and friends and not like weird patronising robots or sitcom therapists.", "When I was a kid I was riding my bike and all of the sudden a toddler comes running from a blindspot and I couldnt brake in time and we collided. I felt awful, he did have scratches in him and his mother was going off on me and I just kept saying he came suddenly I didnt have time to brake and I was sorry. I was so panicked I didnt even adress the child directly asking him if he was ok. My dad came to the rescue though he was calmer than this dude. My dad asked if the kid was ok, and she was like no look at the scratches and I was like... that we were sorry and it was an accident that I was a kid too. She said I shoulfnt have been tiding a bike there, this was absolutely a proper place to ride a bike and wasnt a playground for little kids or anything. I think my dad did end up calmly saying she contributed to this by not watching him. I did look older than I was, don't know if that had an impact on her behaviour. But I still remember this and cried on the way home too. But I was glad my dad defended me! NTA.", "It game me flashback. Happened with my friend, Rory when we were playing in the neighborhood park as 11 year olds. I was on the grass. Rory was using the swing. These are wooden swings strong enough to hold 200 lbs easily. A little girl about 4/5 wanted to cross the swings area even though the park was huge, no idea why and before anyone could stop her she walked in, Rory almost fell trying to stop the swing but the kid got knocked over. She was gone without scratches but was in shock.\n\nHer mother screamed at Rory at the top of her lungs. Rory was humiliated and crying why the mother continued. We were too stunned to say anything and I just walked her home. I wish someone had said something to the mother."]}
