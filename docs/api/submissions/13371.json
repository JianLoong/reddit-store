Our park has one of those zip line rides, which is my daughter's favorite so she immediately ran to ride it. The second she got on and started riding, a little boy (maybe 2 years old) ran in front of her and she collided with him, knocking him over. He started screaming and his mom ran over to pick him up. My daughter apologised profusely and said it was an accident and she didn't see him, but the mom scolded her for not paying attention and said she seriously injured the kid. My daughter started crying and I felt like the mom was being too aggressive, especially saying the kid was \"seriously injured\" since he didn't have a scratch on him, so I stepped in and told the woman not to yell at my kid over a simple accident. She said I'm a lazy mom for not teaching my kid to pay better attention and my daughter's too big to be playing on the playground as it is. Those words triggered something in me and I lost my temper. I called her a bitch for talking to a child like that over an accident and said that maybe if she'd been watching her toddler more carefully, this wouldn't have happened. She stormed off and I took my daughter home immediately. She cried the whole drive, and when we got home she went to her room. I came in to talk to her about what happened, and she said that what the woman said hurt but I was worse because I embarrassed her by \"being a Karen.\" I have to admit I was a bit shocked to hear that, I thought she'd be glad that I defended her.

Your intentions were good, your delivery of them however was definitely inappropriate for a playground. There was no need to use swear words. \n\nTelling the Mother that's enough after your daughter had already apologized and walking away would been a better reaction. \n\nTeach your daughter to be the bigger person, sometimes it sucks but it can leave you feeling better in the end. \n\nI'm gonna go with ESH cause arguing infront of small children doesn't set good examples.", "ESH (expect the kids) \n\nNeither you not the other mom handled the accident well. Both of you overreacted. Also, do you honestly believe it's appropriate to call the other mom a bitch in front of kids because you're mad?", "ESH, except the children. You both acted terribly and were poor examples of how to handle a conflict cause by a genuine accident.", "Rather than accusing you and your daughter of negligence, she could have accepted responsibility for not supervising her 2 year-old closely enough. Or, even better, she could have just accepted that kids have accidents all the time, and be thankful that her child wasn't hurt. She shouldn't have yelled at your daughter. But you both behaved badly. ESH", "ESH\n\nThat woman definitely shouldn't have been scolding your daughter like that and should have addressed you instead.  It sounds like she also needed to be watching her kid, because it's not smart to walk in the zip line path, EVER, especially if you're too young to pay attention to when kids are getting on and off.  \n\nBut you escalated this way beyond what it needed to be.  Your anger is valid, AND it's valid to model standing up for yourself to your daughter.  \n\nBut self or other defense isn't counter offense.  You went on a counter offense.  It wouldn't have been that difficult to calmly say something like, \"My daughter has just as much right to use this playground as any other child.  She has already apologized for colliding with your son, and I'm not convinced it was entirely her fault, because your son should not be walking in the zip line path, and that is your responsibility, not my daughter's.  I don't appreciate you yelling at her, and I am more than capable of handling her discipline.  You tend to your child and I'll tend to mine.\"", "ESH? A nine year old bowling over a toddler could be dangerous. Other mom overreacted. Your response wasn't great. Your poor daughter. She felt terrible enough. I understand you felt attacked. But you are modeling behavior for your daughter. Do you want her responding like this?  There should be a middle ground. Apologize to the toddler, reinforce your child's right to use the equipment safely and walk away.", "ESH\n\nNo fault on the kids, obviously. \n\nSounds like emotions immediately shot through the roof after the accident, and neither parent attempted to deescalate the situation. In situations like that, it\u2019s important to take a moment and remember to just breathe. The last thing a fire like that needs is more gasoline. \n\nYour daughter sounds wise beyond her years. Most of the time a child learns from their parent, but this sounds like an opportunity for you to learn from her response to your, and the other parent\u2019s, actions (versus your expectation of what you thought her response was going to be) and grow as a parent/individual.", "ESH, and your daughter\u2019s right. I understand you were trying to defend her but I\u2019d be mortified if my mom cussed out another parent in public. Both you and the other mom acted childish and petty.", "ESH. Imagine if the other mom called you a B**** in front of your daughter?\n\nFor some reason, I\u2019m picturing two dog parents argument that their big dog should not be in the little dog park.", "ESH except the kids, they behaved amazingly well. Take your lessons from your daughter. Next time remove your child from aggressive adults instead of engaging with them.", "ESH", "ESH.  The two adults are acting worse than the children", "NTA Your child is mortified you called an adult a bitch for the same reason she was taking it to heart when an adult  shouted at her and made her cry. She doesn't realise yet how many adults, even protective mothers of two-year-olds, are indeed, nasty individuals. She likely feels she genuinely did do something wrong. It was an accident but the mother letting a toddler roam into the path of a zip line is obviously the one who should be paying attention. In a few years, she may be angry with herself for crying and letting the woman blame her for her own fault and be glad you called her a b***ch. You didn't physically harm the woman: you just said something cutting. If someone made a similar parenting mistake and tried to blame and humiliate my 9 year old for it and kept going after there were tears and I'd intervened, I would try to be so cutting that they'd feel as shit about themselves as they were making my child feel.", "ESH. \n\nA more appropriate line would have just been, \u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that my daughter is very remorseful, we would just like to help ensure your son is okay.\u201d And if she was still incredibly snippy, \u201calright, child, let\u2019s go find something else to play on,\u201d and walk away\u2026 if she continued to pursue\u2026 a calm \u201cYour expectations of young children at play is unrealistic.

(I mean clearly you were right, lol, why was her toddler running through the zip line, and she just expected the world to stop for that). But sometimes it\u2019s just about showing our children how to remain calm and dignified, and practice some tact, or just avoid confrontation all together. \n\nJust tell her you are sorry that you embarrassed her, and that it just really upset you to see a grown up being mean to her, that it is never okay for grown ups to be mean to kids. Admit that you didn\u2019t need to call her a name or cause a scene and you were wrong for that, but that you want her to know you will ALWAYS have her back. \n\nMaybe you guys could come up with code words\u2026 one for when she doesn\u2019t want you to say anything, and one for when she does.", "ESH. Just because someone else is upset doesn\u2019t mean you have to lose it & call names. You embarrassed & upset your daughter even more than the other mom did, plus you showed her how not to act in a crisis.", "ESH\n\nYour kid hurt her kid (the two year old may have technically been at fault for not paying attention but he's *two* and can't realistically do that. A 9 year old wacking into them would still hurt something fierce). The mom shouldn't have yelled, obviously, but she was ok to be concerned about her child. You reacted to her concern by shrugging it off, and then trying to blame her, and then outright yelling at her.\n\nYour daughter was right to be embarrassed. Both moms in this scenario were being ridiculous over an unfortunate accident.", "ESH", "INFO: what is the target age range for this playground?", "That's not what being a Karen means.

The other mother was in the wrong and should have been watching her 2 year old in a park with equipment like that. 9 years old is a normal age for a playground. It's not great to call people bitches in front of your children, but if the shoe fits sometimes it slips. Don't beat yourself up. Your daughter is just embarrassed because she thinks she's in the wrong for hurting that toddler. She's not, and neither are you.", "Nta. In this case there laws of physics take priority. It is the responsibility of the person to ensure the route is clear before zipping but once the line is commuted to there is no good way to stop. So if that ride is there a young child who can\u2019t stay out of danger is the one who is age inappropriate.", "NTA. Her toddler shouldn\u2019t have been allowed near the zip line for this exact reason. I get all of the E S H votes and now that your kid is getting older the embarrassment factor kicks in but you had every right to argue back. Maybe skip the cursing but she has a lot of nerve to try and shame your kid. Standing up for oneself is also important.", "YTA for name calling. You could have said everything else without the bitch part. Best thing would have been to swoop over, apologize, take your daughter and leave.
