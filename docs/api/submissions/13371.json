I make a little game of checking him all over by poking at him/tickling him, and if he's still upset, I'll be like \"uh oh... are you gonna die from the sheer pain of it all buddy?\" And then I will dramatically flop on the floor and go \"blah!\" And stick my tongue out.

Swallow your pride and be the role model.", "NTA lol I\u2019m sorry she called you that. I think you did the right thing by protecting her. You should educate her on what that is so she knows the difference. Bc in THIS instance, you were just a mother protecting her baby.", "NTA", "NTA but I think you need to have a sit down with your daughter on social literacy", "NTA.\n\nNot saying calling her a bitch was a great thing to do, but I literally can\u2019t possibly judge you for it as I\u2019m sure I would have done the same thing in the situation. It really was quite ironic that she scolded you for not watching your 9 year old daughter well enough when she clearly wasn\u2019t watching her two year old son well enough to not let him venture into the zip line zone, even if your daughter did see him I doubt she would have been able to stop in time. It was an innocent accident between children, very immature of the other mother to yell at an obviously apologetic 9 year old child for her own parenting mistake, and understandable for you to get protective over you daughter and go on the offensive when you felt she was being unjustly attacked. When your daughter is a few years older she will understand why you reacted the way you did, and probably be grateful her mom defended her.", "ESH, you for taking your daughter straight home and the other mother for not watching her 2yr old and letting them run in front of the zip line.\n\nIt wasn't your daughter's fault the child got hit and she apologised, yet she got punished by having to leave the park after just getting there, all because you got into a screaming match with another mother and then decided to leave.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of when I was a child and a neighborhood kid/friend walked behind me like a dufus. Obviously not only did I not see him, but it\u2019s not like I could have done anything if I had. \n\nI smacked into him and broke his nose. I think I can still hear the clunk. Obviously I felt badly and I\u2019m glad he was ok, (eventually) but to this day I adamantly believe it was 100% his fault. \n\nPay attention people! Accidents happen. \n\nYou\u2019re daughter was CLEARLY not intentionally trying to hurt the toddler. Perhaps a lesson in surroundings and awareness has been learned, but he\u2019s a toddler so may not remember. Poor kid. His mother is responsible for his safety. \n\nIt\u2019s not your daughters fault at all. This is clearly an accident. I also feel for her. \n\nAgain NTA.", "NTA- who yells at a child? Who yells at all? It\u2019s okay to be upset but not berate strangers over your own shortcomings. Seriously injured? *commence eye rolls* accidents happen ESPECIALLY at the play ground my kids are always doing wild stuff and getting scrapes and bruises at the park. I\u2019ve never once yelled at another person or child over it", "NTA. You\u2019ll almost never be in the wrong for defending your kid. The other mom was wrong to yell at another child for a simple accident that probably happens multiple times a day. She overreacted and took it out on your daughter and you. It was completely within your right to push back. Your daughter seems to blame herself and it can also be really upsetting and embarrassing to see your own parent lose their temper. What your daughter needs to know to is that you\u2019re sorry that she had to see you lose your temper, that it was justified and that you will always defend her when she needs it because she is worth it.", "ESH - Your daughter and the other child were both capable of paying more attention to where they were going.\n\nThe other mother went overboard.  You followed suit.", "NTA...your daughter doesnt understand thats all", "NTA\n\nYour daughter probably feels guilt that a kid got hurt. And so though she probably was grateful you defended her, she probably was embarrassed as well over the scene two adults were making as well.  Especially when she might have wanted to just hide and get away. Though the other mother started it and all you did was finish it. Unsure your daughter\u2019s personality though and mindset. \n\nMaybe try talking to her that you could have been calmer instead of matching the other mother\u2019s energy. That she did absolutely nothing wrong and sometimes people mess up when they feel heightened emotions. The other mom wanted to blame your daughter because it\u2019s easier than stating how quick a 2 year old can be and this was a natural consequence. She had no right to put the blame solely on your daughter as she did nothing wrong and it was an accident. If there ever is a next time you will always defend your daughter if she is in the right, but will try to be calmer.  Since OP did admit she lost her temper, who knows how it looked to he outside world. But honestly this is a great overall moment on what happens if you snap or lose your temper. \n\nAgain NTA.", "NTA, that's a natural adolescent reaction. She's going to look back and appreciate it when she's older.", "NTA. Why is the mother letting her kid run around in the Zipline area? That's like letting your kid play/work on their skiing in the landing zone of a ski jump (read about it happening once. As guy was coming down to land he saw the kid and twisted etc to miss the kid. Landed a few feet away [don't remember if broke bones, or just shaken up] from kid who was totally unharmed, but kid's father started yelling about how he almost killed the kid, and how irresponsible it was to be using the open/operating ski jump). The 2 yo's mother was probably yelling at your kid because she wanted to deflect her responsibility of watching HER child onto everyone else around her, and got pissed that they didn't do her job for her", "It doesn\u2019t matter what we think, ultimately. It matters what your daughter thinks. She was embarrassed by your behavior. You should spend some time talking with her, whether about this incident or in general, so see if you two have completely different views on life and how you can meet in the middle next time.", "The fact that there was a zipline feature kinda contradicts her argument that OPs kid was too old for the playground. Playgrounds for 2 year Olds should probably not have zip lines.", "Yeah what was OP's daughter supposed to do, even if she saw him?", "It\u2019s especially unfortunate the other mother accused her daughter of being too old to play at the park as it\u2019s hard enough these days to get kids to play outside instead of on electronics and now she probably won\u2019t want to go back to the park after hearing that.", "This is why I hate the Karen meme. It's truly become a way for people to shame women for defending themselves.", "NTA\n\nI hate boitches too", "Part of not being and AH is controlling your animal instincts.", "Whether the other woman actually listens or not, OP would have set a remarkable example for how to act in a confrontation. Doing the right thing shouldn't be contingent upon anyone else's response.", "It's both sexist and ageist. It's specifically used against women of a certain age who don't take as much crap as younger women do.", "This was so weird to me, too! \u201cYour nine-year-old is too old to be on the playground.\u201d \u201cOh, sorry, she had a little break between her last conference call and her annual performance review, so I thought we\u2019d come out and let her run off a little energy.\u201d Let kids be kids, for goodness sake!", "Tik tok is wildly inappropriate for a 9 year old.

You are def not a Karen", "NTA: What does that mom think the age limit at a park is? Also, it\u2019s a park, kids run around and they bump into each other, I\u2019m guessing the 2 year old doesn\u2019t have siblings or they\u2019d realize what happens when kids run around in an area.", "NTA who lets their kid run in front of a zip line\ud83d\udc80 the daughter had no way of stopping", "Such good advice", "I had to search a bit for this sane answer. A lot of comments are compassionate to a mother who got a fright. Not thats its an excuse, but still.", "Yes!!! I actually really worry for this next generation of little girls that keep seeing the message that standing up for yourself is a negative quality.", "Gonna go out on a limb and say the zip line isn\u2019t in the toddler only section", "yeah, it sounds very good in the commenters head but would never have come out of an actual person's mouth in a million years. a lot of comments in this sub are like that unfortunately.", "What if this other mom is bigger and beat op to a pulp for calling her a bitch. As a man I\u2019m always worried about the threat of violence and work to deescalate the situation.", "How did I insult this person? The commenter admitted that they would actively attempt to hurt the other parent and make them feel bad. That's not behaviour I would want to teach my child. Defend yourself surely but teaching kids to want to inflict pain isn't part of my parenting model \n\nOP's child recognized that the other mother was wrong but that OP's reaction was also wrong. It means this 9 year old realizes that you can aspire to be better than rude and hurtful people instead of sinking to their level. Saying the child is better for not wanting to sink to the level of a grown up who would berate a child isn't an insult. \n\nThe issue with swearing in front of children isn't that it makes them bad people. Unless your child knows when such language can be used, they will 1. Use it in front of other children whose parents aren't ok with their children swearing, 2. Use it in school and probably get in trouble after another parent complains. I don't know what schools allow where you are but schools where I am frown upon swearing at school. \n\nI won't even entertain the comment about my values being skewed since you seem to have reached that conclusion based on me not wanting to swear in front of my child and thinking it's good that OP's child doesn't want to sink to the level of her aggressor. \n\nAt no point did I say I cared about the feelings of the woman attacking a child. I just said its not correct that OP's child will grow up to think OP's behaviour was ok and that if she keeps her current mentality then she is a better person than grown up who actually say they would try to hurt someone.", "I was playing devils advocate tbh lol. I think they both acted in the worst way possible", "Ditto. My son requires natural consequences 100%. My daughter, however, will actually listen to my words. That's why I think it's dodgy territory to tell another person how to parent, kids learn differently.", "Side story: when my now-adult niece was very young, she loved dogs and was constantly rushing up to them without asking permission first. My sister was at her wit's end trying to change her behavior. One day, my niece got bit by their own dog (no serious damage, but drew blood). My sis thought, \"Oh good, daughter will finally learn to be careful around dogs.\" Nope. The lesson my niece learned is *that* dog bites, did not expand it to other dogs and it really didn't put much of a dent in her behavior. \n\nEpilogue: my niece is now the very successful owner of a dog grooming studio!", "Yeah, in this case I meant it more than despite me being around 11 she probably thought I was about 15 and ahould have had a better grip on the bike or she thought it was ok to lay into me because I was older. Byt yeah it sucks, I was 8 people though I was 12, and in birthday parties with pinatas deapite me actually being the youngest because I started school a year earlier I was always the last in line and of course I never got anything since the pinata was long gone when it was my turn. It's a silly thing but I always felt sort of left out with those things. Not to mention people expecting me to be 4 years older and to act accordingly.", "Yeah, I started primary school a year earlier and the teacher thought I was a year late lol. This just exacerbated difference in treatment because just by being in the grade I was they already would have a lower estimate higher than my age and then they looked at me and yeah. And later no one would believe me that I was 8 or 9, including for free or cheaper entry to places (at the time you only got identity cards later on and kids didnt usually carry them, now every kid has one when they are born) and I would be last on kid queus stuff despite usually being the youngest. In school sports I was accused by a freaking adult coach of anlther school that I was cheating on my age that I was too old to be playing in the age group. I just felt so annoyed by the unfairness.", "Isn\u2019t it awful how those experiences stick with you? I\u2019m in my forties and I swear, I can remember every unjust and embarrassing situation I was ever in as a child.", "Yeah most of us just reach the height peak early. I am relatively tall for a girl but I am not extremely tall. I had done *most* of the growing by 12. I had clothes from primary school that still fit me.", "Right! Like, if she hadn\u2019t started going I\u2019m sure she would\u2019ve waited for the kid to walk past. But it\u2019s a zip line, there are no breaks once you start going and there\u2019s no way she could\u2019ve stopped once she\u2019d taken off. The mom shouldn\u2019t have let her toddler be anywhere near the zip line in the first place.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I love this", "Mine would do the same thing-after being told a dozen times not to run under the zipline because it's dangerous.  You know what my response to this type of accident would be? A comforting version of I told you so.", "This ^ As a toddler, I ran in front of my sister going full-force on the swing before my mom could catch me. I got knocked over, a tiny leg bruise, cried. Never ran in front of a swing again!", "Thank your for saying this. I\u2019m a psychologist and have taught a ton of anger management classes. While anger is justified in this situation, the way you choose to respond to it is what matters. OP sank down to the other woman\u2019s level and yelled and cursed at her, then essentially ran away. Her behavior sends the message to her daughter that yelling and cursing at other people is acceptable, even though in the moment her daughter wasn\u2019t okay with it. Standing up for her daughter is great, but she could have handled it differently. I don\u2019t understand how people are excusing this by saying she couldn\u2019t control her behavior. Part of being an adult means you are responsible for your choices, behavior, and the consequences. Part of being a parent is modeling appropriate behavior.", "> I don't like her using it either but all her friends and classmates use it and she was suffering from FOMO\n\nSo?

My kids have been rammed by others on the Zipline. I make sure I APOLOGIZE to the kids riding for my kid getting loose and getting in the way! It's on me to keep my kids from being run over.

I had to go apologize to her. \n\nMy mom told me years later that she had actually talked sternly with that teacher behind my back about how she was treating me.... I wish she'd done it in front of me because I thought I was a horrible kid and felt so bad.", "But would you have taken it out on the 9 yr old like this mom did? Probably not, as you are recognizing that your toddler would have been as much as if not more at fault as the kid on the zip line.", "Hey pal, a lesson is not worth ur kid fracturing his skull not breaking a bone. Watch ur kid better.", ">I can't get past the part where she says a 9 year old is too old for a park.\n\nMy primary school tried to pull this when I was a kid. We got a new jungle gym thanks to all the fundraising and then when the recess schedule for it came out, the grade 5s and 6s were not given any time to play on it.\n\nThis seemed wildly unjust (especially since the older kids usually do more fundraising!) So I did what any 10 year old would do... I made a petition LOL. I spent a week going around to kids during recess asking them to sign and then presented it to the principal - we got our day on the jungle gym.\n\nI still just can't understand what was going through the administration's brains when they made that decision.", "I saw this a lot when I was in charge of a moms group where younger kid moms always getting upset at older kids for, shock, being older kids on a playground doing stuff like climbing up a slide or sitting on top of the play structures. Younger kid moms would always tut at big kids for \u201cnot setting a better example\u201d for the toddlers.
