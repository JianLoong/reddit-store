Our park has one of those zip line rides, which is my daughter's favorite so she immediately ran to ride it. The second she got on and started riding, a little boy (maybe 2 years old) ran in front of her and she collided with him, knocking him over. He started screaming and his mom ran over to pick him up. My daughter apologised profusely and said it was an accident and she didn't see him, but the mom scolded her for not paying attention and said she seriously injured the kid. My daughter started crying and I felt like the mom was being too aggressive, especially saying the kid was \"seriously injured\" since he didn't have a scratch on him, so I stepped in and told the woman not to yell at my kid over a simple accident. She said I'm a lazy mom for not teaching my kid to pay better attention and my daughter's too big to be playing on the playground as it is. Those words triggered something in me and I lost my temper. I called her a bitch for talking to a child like that over an accident and said that maybe if she'd been watching her toddler more carefully, this wouldn't have happened. She stormed off and I took my daughter home immediately. She cried the whole drive, and when we got home she went to her room. I came in to talk to her about what happened, and she said that what the woman said hurt but I was worse because I embarrassed her by \"being a Karen.\" I have to admit I was a bit shocked to hear that, I thought she'd be glad that I defended her.
