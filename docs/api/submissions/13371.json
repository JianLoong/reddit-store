Our park has one of those zip line rides, which is my daughter's favorite so she immediately ran to ride it.

My daughter apologised profusely and said it was an accident and she didn't see him, but the mom scolded her for not paying attention and said she seriously injured the kid. My daughter started crying and I felt like the mom was being too aggressive, especially saying the kid was \"seriously injured\" since he didn't have a scratch on him, so I stepped in and told the woman not to yell at my kid over a simple accident. She said I'm a lazy mom for not teaching my kid to pay better attention and my daughter's too big to be playing on the playground as it is. Those words triggered something in me and I lost my temper. I called her a bitch for talking to a child like that over an accident and said that maybe if she'd been watching her toddler more carefully, this wouldn't have happened. She stormed off and I took my daughter home immediately. She cried the whole drive, and when we got home she went to her room. I came in to talk to her about what happened, and she said that what the woman said hurt but I was worse because I embarrassed her by \"being a Karen.\" I have to admit I was a bit shocked to hear that, I thought she'd be glad that I defended her.

Ive certainly been to playgrounds that were limited to kids 8 and under, but if there\u2019s no limit than yeah your daughter is just as entitled to be there as her kid. \n\nEither way, the mom should teach her kid not to run through that area, but your daughter\u2019s embarrassment makes me wonder if she knows she could\u2019ve been more careful, and thus your reaction felt over the top to her. \n\nThe 2 year old shouldn\u2019t walk through a zip line path, and your daughter should make sure it\u2019s clear before she begins her descent, both those things can be true and it seems like your daughter realizes it.", "Just explain to her the difference between a Karen (someone who is being prejudice and rude on purpose) and someone standing up to a bully which is what you did.", "I'm stuck on being too big for the playground at 9 y/o.

Adults shouldn't be bullying anyone much less a child. Then explain to her that a Karen is someone who makes a scene WITHOUT REASON. Someone who is disrespectful and rude because they're not getting their way. She definitely doesn't need to get the idea in her head that standing up for yourself or someone else = Karen. This speaks of her self confidence level and I know you can fix this Mama. You've got this!

You don't hover over top of them. Yes if they are climbing up to high or playing rough you intervene but you can't preempt everything they do. That doesn't alleviate the other moms responsibility but saying she should have prevented it isn't totally realistic IMO.\n\nSecond, ensuring the coast is clear before zipping is largely the responsibility of the person zip lining (similar to pool diving boards and slides--you don't jump till the coast is clear). \n\nThird, given that 2 year olds don't cover a lot of ground quickly given their tiny legs, and a playground zip line is likely no more than 15 feet or so, I'd guess the 2 year old was within 3 or 4 feet of the kill zone and rapidly moving towards it when OPs daughter took off. OP says her daughter was excited. I have little doubt that she should NOT have zipped when she did.\n\nThis isn't to pin blame on OPs kid--it was an accident--but I can see why the other mom was upset.

It would have been Y T A if I blamed OP \"instead of\" the aggressive mom.", "You are creating a straw man. My response was a firm boundary, not a loosey-goosey \"o it's fine.\"\n\nYou can protect your child (and should, as I clearly told OP she was right to do in my first comment) without making the situation worse or causing harm yourself, ESPECIALLY in front of kids.", "Not really. If you have a child who tends to run off you adjust.
