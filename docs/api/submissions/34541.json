Homophobia in any case is enough justification to remove yourself from the situation. Sorry to hear your family isn\u2019t supportive, OP. NTA", "Absolutely NTA. It's not about being demanding; it's about being treated fairly and with respect. If your brother is inviting other family members' partners, there's no valid reason to exclude yours. Going to a wedding where your identity or relationship is disregarded is hurtful and unfair.", "NTA for not attending a family wedding without your long term partner. Honestly what did your brother think you'd do? He should do the right thing and politely extend an olive branch of a +1.", "NTA - You aren't being totally unreasonable.  At five years, your relationships deserves a plus one invite.  Your brother is either being too cheap or he has it in for your SO, as well as your mother.  It is his wedding and he can invite who he wants but it seems he is deliberately excluding your SO, so yes, pass.  You are doing the right thing by your SO in this request.", "Of course you are NTA. Your brother and your family frankly suck. He lied to you about why your partner isn\u2019t invited because he didn\u2019t even have the stones to be honest with you about it. You are mature and doing right by your GF for showing that you value her and will not let her be treated like some kind of embarrassment .\n\nThe only ones who should be embarrassed are your brother and family. Shame on them. Build a life with your GF and forget these people who have just shown you exactly how much they value you.", "NTA - They have every right to invite who they like, but you have every right to decline the invitation.

The catering excuse would be reasonable if not for the fact that, as you mention, he invited other unmarried couples, which gives the impression of a bias against you.", "NTA It's a wedding invitation. You may RSVP with regrets if you'd rather not go. Honestly, it's sort of ironic they're worried about the optics of your girlfriend as your plus one and worried about the optics of your conspicuous absence.", "NTA you\u2019re not invited. You stated your boundary and declined the invitation.\n\nTell your mom that unreasonable is thinking a wedding invitation is a summons. It\u2019s not you were invited and decided you would decline the invitation.\n\nThe reason your family is mad is that you\u2019re exposing their homophobia. If you don\u2019t go then they can\u2019t play happy family and they will have to explain why you\u2019re not there.\n\nI would suggest you and your gf take a trip the weekend of the wedding. Make sure you post lots of photos on social media. Do this so your family cannot lie and say your absence is because you\u2019re sick.\n\nPlus if anyone ask why you did not attend be honest. Your partner of 5 years was not invited when other relatives partners where and given your families feelings about your lifestyle you can\u2019t help it is because they homophobic. Do not protect them. They deserve for family and friends to see their true colors.", "NTA. Why celebrate his relationship if he doesn't respect yours?", "NTA\n\nNot inviting your partner because you are a same sex couple is a good reason to skip the wedding.", "NTA. What\u2019s unreasonable is Mother believing the wedding day is important enough to other people to care. No one *has* to be at the wedding except the bride, groom, officiant and a witness, they have that plus 96 others so I think they\u2019ll be live with one person not attending.\n\nIf they wanted to save face and show they were truly a united family; they should try being one first.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to hide yourself away to cater to your family. If everyone else got a plus one it's definitely not unreasonable to make this your hill to die on, and not attend without your partner. \n\nBy the sounds of it you've sacrificed enough of yourself over the years for these homophobic AH's. If they haven't accepted you and your partner after 5 years it seems they never will.", "NTA. If you were straight you would have gotten a plus-one. Full stop", "NTA.

Don't let him evade or equivocate. Then decide what to do from there. \n\nBut don't let your family tell you that standing up for yourself and your partner is \"making it about yourself.\" Your brother made it about you when he intentionally and specifically excluded your partner.", "Nta. \n\nTo mom.\n\nYes, it's his wedding and right to invite who he wishes. As it is mine to accept or not. I am not making demands. I am clearly stating my boundaries, considering every OTHER couple gets their plus one. Clearly, people are still not accepting of my life, which is their choice. It's also my choice not to suck it up or enable such behavior to make family happy or avoid drama. You don't wish to support my reasoning that's fine as clearly supporting family only goes the way of me giving up my needs to give others what they want when clearly I am not in the wrong to refuse as is my right. I will no longer discuss this, nor will I attend even if my partner is invited as you are showing who you support and who you don't. I will be distancing myself from so called family for awhile while I process and decide how much I am willing to put myself and my partner through to people who clearly do not support me just because they are family.\n\n\nBut that's me", "NTA\n\n5 years is essentially a marriage. I\u2019ve seen several end before hitting that milestone lol\n\nThe fact that he\u2019s invited other people\u2019s spouses and partners means it\u2019s definitely personal and probably because you\u2019re gay.\n\nIf your parents or brother try to guilt you, ask them specifically why other partners were invited but not yours, ESPECIALLY anyone who\u2019s been dating for less than your five years.", "NTA.  Not at all.", "It\u2019s his wedding and he can invite who he wants. However his invitation doesn\u2019t mandate you to attend. Your significant other has been with you 5 years.

They would though.. so maybe just don\u2019t go. \n\nOr find out from your cousins if their plus ones are all going and if not ask them to take your partner! But I guess that all depends on how you all get along.", "NTA and I think that sounds like it is because of discrimination", "NTA, I wouldn\u2019t attend either", "NTA. Meanwhile, statistically in any wedding with 100 guests there will be creepy uncles, molestery cousins and drunk aunties who start with the racist diatribes after a second rum and coke. You and your partner don't need to be part of this joining of two families in homophobia.", "NTA. You're not required to attend a wedding for any reason. And this does seem like yr GF isn't being invited because of the queer issue, if everyone else gets to bring their SO.", "NTA... I'm mean. I would go and show up in an obnoxiously rainbow dress. With sparkles.", "I would not attend a wedding if I were not allowed to bring a Plus One. Attending a wedding alone is miserable. Nearly all the other guests come in couples. I have done this before and would never do it again. In my experience, singles at weddings frequently sit and drink too much because they feel bored and sorry for themselves, sitting alone while everyone else is on the dance floor. \n\nYou did not demand and invitation. You simply told him the reason why you had declined. This is your right. \n\nNTA", "Well we were invited to a wedding long ago and the kids weren\u2019t invited so we decided not to go. Period, end of story.  It doesn\u2019t even have to be more than that.  It\u2019s not keeping the peace it\u2019s I\u2019m not leaving these people out.  Or in your case your partner.  We are together one.", "NTA. The only thing I would\u2019ve done differently is that I would have just told brother that I wouldn\u2019t be going.

There wasn't a reasonable (or even unreasonable) rule that was applied equally to everyone that matched certain, understandable criteria (some people say only a +1 for married spouses irrespective of relationship duration even if it means excluding people who have been together for ten years and have a child together: I think that's a silly rule, but I can accept that some people consider marriage as something special or \"more committed\", so if they was the rule they applied to everyone, I could live with that). You were not allowed a +1 despite being a sibling to the groom and having a long-term partner, solely because you are in a same-sex relationship. I don't know what that is besides from homophobia.\n\nYou also already came out to your family so it's not like you'd use this wedding to come out. I don't see the issue. Sounds like your brother hasn't accepted your sexuality/relationship or is appeasing someone who hasn't (are your parents paying for the wedding and do they have an issue with you being gay?).\n\nI wouldn't go either.
