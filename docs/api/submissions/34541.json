It is his decision and you are also not the asshole for deciding not to attend the wedding without your partner. \nI decided to not go to my cousins wedding because my sister (who is my half sister) wasn\u2019t invited although the rest of my siblings (full siblings) were invited. \nI did however not tell my cousin why I didn\u2019t attend his wedding, I just said that I had other plans.", "NTA. Sorry that your brother has put you through this. If other relatives get to bring their +1s but not you, you have every right not to attend his wedding. Don\u2019t listen to your mother.", "NTA\n\nConfront him.with the +1 your cousins recieved and see what he says then...\n\nAnd..  even IF he now gives you a +1..  will you go with GF???", "Allowing everyone else to have their heterosexual partner there is enough to assume he was intentionally leaving YOUR gf out. Homophobia in any case is enough justification to remove yourself from the situation. Sorry to hear your family isn\u2019t supportive, OP. NTA", "Absolutely NTA. It's not about being demanding; it's about being treated fairly and with respect. If your brother is inviting other family members' partners, there's no valid reason to exclude yours. Going to a wedding where your identity or relationship is disregarded is hurtful and unfair.", "NTA for not attending a family wedding without your long term partner. Honestly what did your brother think you'd do? He should do the right thing and politely extend an olive branch of a +1.", "NTA - You aren't being totally unreasonable.  At five years, your relationships deserves a plus one invite.  Your brother is either being too cheap or he has it in for your SO, as well as your mother.  It is his wedding and he can invite who he wants but it seems he is deliberately excluding your SO, so yes, pass.  You are doing the right thing by your SO in this request.", "Of course you are NTA. Your brother and your family frankly suck. He lied to you about why your partner isn\u2019t invited because he didn\u2019t even have the stones to be honest with you about it. You are mature and doing right by your GF for showing that you value her and will not let her be treated like some kind of embarrassment .\n\nThe only ones who should be embarrassed are your brother and family. Shame on them. Build a life with your GF and forget these people who have just shown you exactly how much they value you.", "NTA - They have every right to invite who they like, but you have every right to decline the invitation. A sibling's long term partner is a reasonable expectation for an invite and that omission doesn't have to be accepted.", "NTA. The catering excuse would be reasonable if not for the fact that, as you mention, he invited other unmarried couples, which gives the impression of a bias against you.", "NTA It's a wedding invitation. You may RSVP with regrets if you'd rather not go. Honestly, it's sort of ironic they're worried about the optics of your girlfriend as your plus one and worried about the optics of your conspicuous absence."]}
