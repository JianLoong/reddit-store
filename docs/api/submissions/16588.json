We have been married coming up on 32 years soon. \n\nMy daughter was in a long relationship and married for approximately 9 years, and for a long time I thought that is was a good relationship, when out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband. \n\nWe were told it was a mutual decision, but that ultimately, he wasn\u2019t the greatest partner, and there were many things that she was not satisfied with in their relationship. So she wanted to leave. We supported her decision.\n\nAbout a year after the divorce, she introduced us to her new boyfriend. And while my husband and I thought it may be a bit early to date, we decided to continue to support her and meet him. He was, and is a very charming man who treats our daughter wonderfully, and you can tell she is extremely happy.\n\nNow to the argument. Recently, we were talking with one of our daughters friends who was visiting our town, and were discussing our daughters job and her wonderful boyfriend. Her friend in the conversation made a comment about how they were lucky to be in the same orientation together when they started work.\n\nAs soon as she saw our confused faces, she gave us the full story, as she realized we hadn\u2019t been given it. Our daughter had told us while her and her boyfriend worked for the same employer, they didn\u2019t meet until after the divorce.\n\nWe pressed the friend for more information, and she begrudgingly told us that our daughter and her boyfriend had met during orientation at work while our daughter was going through her marital issues. This led to them becoming closer and her filing for divorce from her ex husband about a year later.\n\nSo later that day, I asked to have a conversation with my daughter and brought up what her friend had told us. She turned white as snow, and basically confirmed her friends story. But reiterated that there was no physical cheating.\n\nI told her that physical cheating was not the only way that you could hurt someone. And that it appeared that she had emotionally cheated on her ex husband. He may not have been the greatest person, but it didn\u2019t excuse her actions. I told her that I was disappointed in her, and while I supported her leaving a bad marriage, that I couldn\u2019t look at her and her boyfriend the same in this new light in regards to cheating. I still love her and will treat her boyfriend with respect, but it is definitely something I have a hard time looking past.\n\nShe got angry with me for not continuing to support her in her journey beyond divorce. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683434794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ad4ht/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_im_disappointed/", "score": 1142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like she never truly confided in you with her marital issues, especially since you were shocked when she went to get a divorce...\n\n>out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband\n\nThat being said, you have no idea how bad things were for her or what she was really going through leading up to that and if she had a co-worker that she could confide in and that supported her, that's great, she deserves to have someone there who she could.  Marriages end long before the divorce is even requested most of the time and if that friendship and support turned into something more after, then good for her. \n\nYou're her mother, you can be disappointed and think you know better all you want, but pulling your support from her and talking down to a grown adult woman? YTA - she may be your child but she isn't a child anymore. It's her life and she deserves to be happy.", "YTA she divorced him for a reason. It\u2019s not like she strung her ex along she left him. And then a whole year later she got with her current bf.", "YTA. It's not your business, she isn't 20 years old.\n\nI'm 42 and don't really give a damn about my mother's opinion. Keep heading in that direction won't you.", "YTA. It is extraordinarily inappropriate and rude for you to think you have the right to decide whether or not your daughters divorce was justified.", "YTA kinda\n\nWhat would have had her do exactly? Like just run through the options here, she was in a marriage that she already wasn't happy with and she then went on to meet somebody she does love. So what was supposed to happen? She broke off her marriage so she didn't end up cheating, that seems like the right choice to me", "YTA.  None of the information the \u201cfriend\u201d told you was any of your business.  It\u2019s your daughter\u2019s life and it seems like there is a reason she didn\u2019t tell you any of this.", "YTA - how old is your daughter again? Seriously why are you sticking your nose into her business so much? It didn't work out, she found a confidant, things changed in her life. Don't be surprised if she eventually gets angry and \"suddenly\" goes no contact with you", "Marriages that fail are typically over long before the court declares it so. Your daughter\u2019s sounds as if it definitely fit that bill.\n\nWas she wrong to be emotionally invested somewhere else before the paperwork was done? Who knows. Maybe. But the bottom line is it isn\u2019t her new beau you should be judging for that, it is your daughter. \n\nNTA for being disappointed in her - potentially - bad timing. But not so clear cut on judgin the fella, again, is is her, not him, that should be holding to a standard.", "YTA. It must be nice living on high and judging other people for their lives when it has no impact on you whatsoever", "YTA. Relationships rarely end \"out of nowhere\". There are usually pretty obvious indicators that things are not as they should be. You missed those indicators, either because you weren't looking, or because your daughter didn't feel she could tell you. Given how you speak about your daughter (so reluctantly, so begrudgingly when it comes to her choices about her life), I definitely have my own opinion as to which of those it is.\n\nGiven that you thought your daughter's marriage ended \"out of nowhere\", it seems as though you don't really know a whole lot of detail about your daughter's relationships - not her previous marriage, not the one she is in now. Despite this, you've decided to make some assumptions about her behaviour, without confirming with her exactly what happened, or considering for even a moment why she might feel the need to withhold information from you.\n\nI'd be hesitant to tell you anything about this too. You've jumped straight to \"my daughter is a lying cheater!\" based on \"appears\" to be the case. I bet this isn't the first time, and without any reflection on your part, it may not be the last one either.", "YTA. You have no business judging something you know nothing about. There is not a marriage in the world that has ended out of nowhere. To me, it sounds just like your daughter sees you for who you really are - a meddling, judgmental person with nothing nice to say. Of course you are on information diet, you can not seem to fathom there are literally hundreds of possible things that could have gone wrong in their marriage. Maybe he cheated! Maybe no one cheated. Maybe they just grew apart. Point is, YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT OUT. You literally had 10% of the story and a lot of imagination for the other part.", "Wow... just, wow. YTA.\n\n1. You think dating someone new a year after a divorce is somehow \"too soon.\" *What*? \n2. You admit that you know that your daughter had \"martial issues\" before she met this new guy, yet you've drawn the conclusion that he was somehow a part of her filing for divorce because she was \"emotionally\" cheating on her husband. Again, *what*?\n3. You concede her husband was a bad partner (while omitting any information on why/how he was a bad partner), but then said it didn't \"excuse\" her actions. What actions does she need to excuse, OP? Talking to a new friend who happens to be male?\n\nYou claim you support her choice to leave a bad marriage. Did it not occur to you, OP, that your daughter filed for divorce when she met a man who - as a friend - treated her with the respect and care that she had always wanted from her husband but hadn't ever gotten? Did it occur to you that maybe meeting him showed her that she didn't have to settle for what she had been living with?\n\nShe clearly lied to you about it because she knew this is how you'd react. Are you even disappointed with your daughter, OP? Are you sure the disappointment isn't with yourself?", "YTA\n\nYou're dredging up something that happened years ago to berate your daughter? Perhaps this is exactly the reason she doesn't confide in you, she can't bear your judgemental moral superiority. Enjoy the view from your high horse, I hope you don't fall off it...", "YTA.  I started to say ESH assuming your daughter lied to her husband about her relationship or feelings towards the guy from work.  But I don\u2019t know that.  She may have been upfront with him.  Her friends knew so maybe he did too.  Did it ever occur to you that maybe she didn\u2019t tell you specifically for a reason? \n\nYour daughter doesn\u2019t really owe you an explanation about the demise of her marriage.  That is between her and her husband.  My guess is that based on some of your comments (a year after a divorce is too soon to start dating?)your views on relationships are far more conservative than hers and she didn\u2019t want the drama talking about it with you would entail.  Remember telling a child you are \u201cdisappointed\u201d in them, while terribly cruel, could be effective in controlling a child.  But your daughter is an adult. Your \u201cdiss appointment\u201d probably only results in her confiding in you even less than she does already.", "\"Daughter, I'm so very disappointed in you for seeking happiness. How dare you meet someone you'd eventually fall in love with and get with over a year after your divorce from a man who just couldn't treat you right or make you happy. I absolutely cannot support your happiness.\"\n\nYes, you're the fucking asshole. YTA big time.", "YTA.  \u201cEmotional cheating\u201d is ill-defined nonsense used to punish people for making a connection with someone.", "YTA an over-involved and judgemental one. She's not a kid, it's none of your business. And her \"friend\" is an AH too for telling a story that was none of her business to tell.", "YTA it's her life mum.", "YTA. Get out of your daughter's business.", "Why bring it up at all? It\u2019s been done with and over, it\u2019s in the past, she\u2019s with who she\u2019s with, and while you\u2019ll always be her parent, you stepped out of line here because she\u2019s a grown woman. It was enough to tell her you know, and you should\u2019ve left it at that.", "YTA, doesn't sound like she did a damn thing wrong, you're just pissed she didn't sit around all mopey and chaste for the time she was getting a divorce. grow the fuck up. you're 55. plenty old enough to know adult relationships aren't always easy. \n\nyour post is insanely judgemental and you owe your daughter several apologies. \"too soon\" after more than a year, like come ON", "NTA. I think that is a fair response, and I would feel similarly about learning a loved one may have cheated. Loving someone does not and should not equal excusing all their behavior.", "NTA", "I\u2019m honestly a bit surprised by the judgments and think if this was someone else in the daughter\u2019s life, the judgments would be opposite. Or even if it was one of the parents who left a marriage the same way and the daughter found out. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t actually sound that judgmental to me. They supported daughter\u2019s decision to divorce at first and didn\u2019t know the details. Daughter not telling the details doesn\u2019t really indicate much about their relationship - I know a lot of people super private about those things even in non-cheating circumstances or circumstances where parents aren\u2019t controlling and judgmental, a lot of ended marriages people are shocked by, etc. If anything, most people I know go out of their way to paint their relationships rosy af to everyone until they literally can\u2019t. It also doesn\u2019t seem that judgmental that parents thought it was soon for her to be dating - it doesn\u2019t sound like they expressed it, and it\u2019s a sentiment a *lot* of people have after relationships end (including on this sub). And honestly, if her marriage was that horrible, she probably should have taken some time to herself to work through it and get therapy instead of jumping straight into another relationship. \n\nIn short, the most judgmental things in the post look like things privately thought rather than expressed, and it seems *in actions* they did support their daughter. \n\nThe most AH thing I see OP doing is jumping to conclusions about emotional cheating before asking more questions about the circumstances, such as how bad the marriage was before she met the new guy, etc. But I can even see *why* this happened as they found out she blatantly lied. That doesn\u2019t paint a positive picture, and they were probably still reeling from the discovery of being lied to. There\u2019s little I hate more than being lied to and it\u2019s honestly the number one way to turn me against someone even in situations I\u2019d normally be sympathetic. \n\nThe worst judgment I can see for this is E S H based on the combo of daughter lying and parents jumping to said conclusions without more info/inquiring and hearing more of the story. But I\u2019m still landing on NTA unless there\u2019s missing info. I\u2019d have a hard time not being disappointed in their shoes, too.", "NTA.  How incredibly disappointing to find out that your daughter is a cheater and a liar and a gaslighter to boot. None of the other people who\u2019ve posted \u201cYTA\u201d knows what that\u2019s like.  Your daughter hid this relationship from you and lied to you. She didn\u2019t just cheat on her husband, she cheated on you too.  That\u2019s what hurts.  \n\nTake some space from your daughter.  You don\u2019t need to tell her you are doing that though, just be busy for a while as you grieve the death of the image you had of your daughter, who you thought could do no wrong. \n\nEventually maybe you can have a more honest relationship with her, snow that you know she is just a person and not a shining angel.", "Very light ESH, it sounds like she has left out some information on how she met her boyfriend, and it seems there are some assumptions you\u2019re making on the nature of their relationship during that first year before she became divorced. I do think you need to give her the opportunity to explain. \n\nOther than that, what you said sounds perfectly reasonable, you\u2019re not telling her to break up or anything ridiculous like that. I would just confirm the situation in case it genuinely wasn\u2019t like that.", "Are you a parent or a judge. Because the two are quite different things. If you're a parent then unconditional love is the order of the day. If you're a judge then yes judge away. But don't expect to be confided in, trusted or respected.", "YTA and way too enmeshed in a grown woman's love life.  Like to a creepy and unhealthy degree.", "YTA, it\u2018s none of your business and \u201echeating\u201c means something different for every couple. Your daughter behaved respectfully by not cheating physically, divorcing and waiting a year to officialise the new relationship.

Having been in a similar position to your daughter, with no cheating involved, you cannot begin to imagine how much the unfair and uniformed judgements from people you thought you could rely on hurt.

So many people on this sub just jump to YTA without any thought or empathy.  It very well could have been out of nowhere.  The daughter admits to lying and emotionally cheating.   She probably knew she was going to be judged because what she did was wrong and she knew it.\n\nI've been the \"work husband\" because my coworkers husband essentially treated her like how you'd imagine a wife was treated portraying the 1950's.  We started to get close because she always wanted to go out for lunch when she was pregnant, literally everyday, and I also like to go out for lunch.  I was single, rented a cheap apartment and was essentially living the bachelor life so $15-20 a day for lunch wasn't a concern for me.  She'd refer to me as her work husband and she was my work wife.  At first I was fine with it but things started to kind of go over the top.  It was little things like not correcting someone who asked when we were expecting or if the baby was a boy or a girl.  Then she asked me about names I'd name a kid and I made it clear I never planned on having any of my own but she insisted, so I told her a boy and girl name from my family that had meaning to my family.  She decided to push her husband to go with one of those names and he had no idea why.  When she announced the baby, the babies first name was what I said I'd go with and the middle name was my first name.  When I asked her about this she could have just said she liked it and said I didn't plan on using it anyway but, she said her work husband was going to be a big part of the babies life and wanted me to be the godfather.  It got real awkward real fast.  She didn't come back to work after I declined to be the godfather for numerous reasons.  Mainly I'm a single guy and both her and her husband have family in the area that would be far better suited than I would be.\n\nTLDR:  I apparently like food as much as pregnant women and became the \"work husband\" to a coworker that went too far in my mind.", "She didn't cheat, though.

It can be intentional, or selfish, or accidental. But realizing you've fallen out of love with your current partner is one thing when your choices are plod along with them because you're both used to it or go ahead with your life alone, and it's a whole other issue when that lack of love is highlighted by the love (or in some cases, the high/power trip) you develop for someone else. That's when you have the choices of emotional cheating and, like you said, \"acting with respect\"\n\nReminds me of that AITA post where that OP kept getting her \"work husband\" snacks tailored to his keto diet and he kept saying no in all ways except directly.

Now that she is happy, celebrate her happiness with her, and move on from the divorce, as it's in the past now and can't be undone.\n\nI was in an abusive marriage with a husband who hardly worked or helped around the house while I worked multiple jobs and came home to work even more, and who verbally and mentally abused me. I had threatened to divorce him if he didn't change and help facilitate a better partnership between us, and while he sometimes improved for a month or two, inevitably he would return to his old ways, and each time the abuse got worse.\n\nEventually it got to a point where he had punched a hole in a wall because \"I made him do it,\" and he had charged at me as though he was going to hit me, and then stop just short of doing so. At the same time, he would say that if I left him, he would drive off a bridge or kill himself some other way, and would tell me that I would die completely alone because it would be my fault.\n\nFor a long time, I didn't tell my parents any of this, even though I am very close to them. Why? Because my husband had purposely isolated me from all other friends and family, but he \"let\" me have weekly phone calls with my parents. I didn't want to lose my last family connection, so I didn't tell them the truth of my daily life.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years with him, I had nearly had enough, but I was so deep in a hole in this relationship that I thought it just had to be this way forever. Then my husband starting hanging out with this really nice guy from work, I'll call him Nick, and brought him home to hang out. This guy and I eventually became friends too, and we would all hang out together. Nick and I discovered we had a lot of shared interests, such as art and hiking, so we planned day hikes and art museum visits, and always invited my husband. He preferred to stay home than do these activities, so Nick and I would go on our own. I began to realize that my husband had been dragging me down with him for years, because I was suddenly living new experiences and enjoying my life and myself more when I spend time with Nick. I even started going out more by myself, going on hikes and visiting art galleries just on my own, which my husband hated and very much told me so - the hole in the wall was because I went out on my own one day while he was home playing video games.\n\nEventually I took a trip with my parents, and during the trip I realized that when I got back, I had to tell my husband that I wanted a divorce. I told my parents everything that has been happening for the past few years, and they were shocked, but also not entirely surprised. Even though I hadn't told them, they knew I was not happy in the marriage.\n\nThey not only supported the divorce, but asked me to come live with them when I left my husband so he couldn't come after me (which he also threatened - \"if you leave me, I'll find you.\"). They also knew that I had a friendship with Nick, and supported that friendship and wanted it to continue. Their support was what gave me the courage to go through with the divorce, despite my fears.\n\nIt wasn't long after the divorce that I started dating Nick, and my parents were fully supportive of that as well, even knowing that I befriended Nick prior to divorcing my ex. They knew that our friendship was one thing that helped me rediscover myself separately from my husband, and was part of what led me to finally divorce him after years of wanting to leave.\n\nNick and I are now married, and have been together for 10 years, and I've never been happier. And my parents are overjoyed for us.", "YTA\n\nYou cannot control who you fall in love with, and your daughter acted on her feelings and divorced her husband.

Yeah, maybe, but I do not begrudge my brother or his ex-GF for that matter, for how things turn out. Sometimes you can know you are unhappy but not really understand it or know how to move on.

Not much to do there or feel guilty about!", "Yeah, lol, \u201ctoo soon\u201d when *she* was the one that filed for divorced and made the option to leave in the first place. Regardless of the reason I wouldn\u2019t surprised that someone filing for divorce could want to see other people already. They\u2019re just baffled because they\u2019re out of the loop and only know what\u2019s generally going on with her", "\u201cRelationship\u201d is a broad term. When dating someone, you never vowed to support them in sickness and health, for richer or poorer, thick and thin, as long as you both live.\n\nI would 100% agree with you if this was her boyfriend she left, but it was her husband, that should mean something", "dude, same. My marriage was never great to begin with but when I started working with my now boyfriend, we worked together for a year before we ever went out for a \"fuck this job,\" drink. like i wasn't even sure he knew I was a woman.\n\nwe started being friends outside of work and about the same time i found out my ex husband had MULTIPLE online dating profiles and was looking to leave me. He was also financially abusive, verbally abusive and at times physically abusive. my now boyfriend gave me a safe space to go to when I was ending my marriage. it looks real bad that I moved in with him and then started dating him but luckily for me my parents just shrugged it off and declared it none of their business.  They love me and respect me and are here when I need them and love and accept my boyfriend. We've been together for five years now.", "Ouch yeah I know that face\nAnd the eye bug when angry that one is wild.", "[deleted]", "But it doesn\u2019t matter if the daughter is the AH or not. That\u2019s a moot point. The issue is no one asked the mother for her input or judgement but she gave it anyway.", "This is not reason to believe cheating happened unless you\u2019re one of those dough heads who think two people of compatible sexual orientation can\u2019t be friends", "Yeah, I think OP is misunderstanding, perhaps deliberately, the meaning of an emotional affair. It is engaging in romantic interaction outside your relationship, not just having feelings for someone even if you don\u2019t act on them. She could have cared about this person but completely waited until she ended the relationship with her husband to express those feelings and that would not be an emotional affair just because there were feelings there. Her parents just assumed because they always seem to want to think the worst of her.", "And 18 is about when the daughter married. Now 30, divorced 3 years ago, married for 9 years. \n\nOP, YTA. Stay out of it. While emotional cheating is a thing,  you have no evidence it took place. Added to that,  I'd question why your daughter wouldn't go to you for support when her husband was mistreating her.", "I mean if my step daughter was talking to a guy who murders people, I would assume that may be a tad my business lol", "How do you make society better? When loved ones act like idiots, you tell them they\u2019re acting like idiots\u2026you guys are so unbelievably wrong, but in 2023 I am not shocked at all \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "Oh don\u2019t start throwing facts at the ppl being judgmental at OP for being for being judgmental \ud83d\ude02", "There\u2019s no reason to think that there was cheating", "She cheated on her husband.\n\nOP is within their rights to tell their daughter that her actions were wrong.\n\nThat because of her actions they no longer want to interact with her affair partner, and that they currently don\u2019t like the person she is.\n\nWhat part of that is toxic? Oh right none of it.\n\nToxic is the daughter being upset that her affair has come to light and people are no longer interested in making her feel happy.", "One day I was at the pool with my son, and got to talking to this man. I found myself not wanting him to know I was married, and that's when it hit me that my marriage, which had been rocky for years, was probably over. I didn't do anything with that guy, but I did get divorced (Took me way longer than it should have). \n\nPoint being, it could well have been that OP's daughter was in a bad marriage, met this guy she realised would be so much better, and that gave her the impetus to realise her marriage was over.", "That is called monkey branching.  That is how you blindside your partner.  If the relationship is over, end it & then move on to the next relationship.", "her husband sounded terrible. we\u2019re beyond the point where women need to tough it out, experience abuse, and live submissive depressing lives all because of a few invisible vows that their husband chose to ignore.", "Who's saying it doesn't mean something?", "It's amazing how every judgemental mother has the same set of facial expressions lol", "My ex was abusive, but the rest of the story was very similar to mine.", "She got it from her own life? Did you even read what she said?", "Think there was another similar post today - wasn\u2019t it monkey branching ?", "I respectfully disagree.  I believe emotional cheating is cheating.  I don\u2019t know if there is a right or wrong, I believe it\u2019s a matter of opinion.  If your spouse had feelings for someone at work how would you feel?", "Why, because she most likely cheated, guess we\u2019ll never know", "Respectfully disagree,  Mom is allowed to have feelings.  She told her daughter she supports her but is disappointed regarding the emotional cheating and lying( lie of omission).  Sounds like she had an open and fair conversation with her daughter.  I think that\u2019s a lot better than not saying anything.   I don\u2019t see mom as an asshole.", "Then why lie? And why \u201cturn white\u201d when confronted?", "Sure, OP can be disappointed. She just doesn\u2019t need to open her mouth hole about it.", "Not sure if I saw that one! Could have been, I was playing with my doggo for most of the day, but it wouldn't surprise me honestly.", "Oh hun, I wish you all the luck in the world with that incredibly naive idea of love.", "Shitty of course, but it would be for the best to end it immediately instead of having my spouse play a role, me noticing slowly something is off and eventually finding out it was all a play, because they were too ashamed to leave me. That would break me. I can't control their feelings, it'd be manipulation if I tried to control how they feel about me and others, because if I didn't want them to even have the chance to fall for someone else, I'd need to isolate them. You cannot keep someone away from people. That's the only way anyone would even be able to stop their spouse from potentially falling for someone else.\n\nAnd this has happened to friends of mine, the fallout was much bigger, because their partner played a role out of shame and fear of other people reactions. All of my friends said they would have preferred if their ex partner had broken it off right away once the feelings changed and not play a role. Some of my friends now have such big trust issues that they're scared to get into another relationship, scared of the chance of it being a role once again.\n\nAlso, I said this in another comment, respondign to someone, this alienates victims of abuse. Sometime they're either too scared to leave or don't realize it and falling in love again with someone else can make them realize their situation is fucked. That they can't fix their partner. It's how many of them even get the strength to leave, not everyone has family or friends left over at that time willing to help.", "In some ways it is. There is such thing as internally setting emotional boundaries. If you begin developing feelings for someone else (especially when you\u2019re married, as opposed to dating), set emotional and physical boundaries. Go home, kiss  your spouse, get counseling if you need it. Work on building what you have.\n\nWe are not slaves to emotions and feelings, but we are responsible for our actions.", "I have a lot of feelings. It doesn\u2019t mean I go around sharing them unsolicited. That\u2019s called being an asshole.", "Read the post, the friend states, that she became close with the work guy and this led to her filing for divorce.", "Easy. Her daughter knows that she\u2019s guilty before proven innocent and wanted to avoid a well worn pattern with this dynamic. You can tell because op was surprised when the divorce happened. Which means her daughter knew better than to come to her for support when her husband was \u201cnot the best person.\u201d", "Did he end up going with her?", "That's exactly what you should do, but at the same time, it's still cheating. It's a cowardly, though very realistic response to a crappy marriage/relationship, but it's still using that as an excuse to cheat. Falling in love with someone else, while in a relationship, is definitely cheating.", "Of course we are responsible for our actions, I never said otherwise. I was referring simply to the development of feelings, not to acting on them.", "Parents should talk to their kids, yes even their adult kids", "Why make assumptions to defend the daughter?It\u2019s just as likely the OP is surprised, because the daughter didn\u2019t have any issues until she met the new guy. Which, shocker, is what cheaters do.", "Why are you worried about that", "How? Honestly asking. \n\nI see cheating as something you actively do (be it physical or emotionally) but falling in love with someone isn't something you can chose. Is it horrible for the person in love? Yes. But if you break up when you know you love someone else then I wouldn't personally consider it cheating - considering they didn't do anything with the person they fell in love with, just recognized it. I think this is a really blurry line and if you don't act on these feelings and end things then it's not cheating.", "The development of feelings can be halted in its tracks as well. I have personally started to develop feelings for someone, and as soon as I figured out they were married I nipped that in the bud and put up an emotional wall. We remained good colleagues for years after and he never knew. \n\nGaining control of your emotions and feelings is a skill. Practice it, and you\u2019ll never be a slave to your emotions", "Respectfully disagree. Boundaries matter. Getting their feelings out only benefits the parents. There was nothing to be gained from this.", "I'm really not assuming anything, I'm asking questions based on another perspective than yours. Our culture is so quick to throw things away and devalue others so that we get what we want from them or we leave. Commitment is important and difficult. Guarantee you the daughter finds another shiny object and divorces this guy too. \n\nMy aunt and uncle were in a \"loveless\" relationship for 20 years and stuck it out because they made a vow and because they had children. Now they are happier than they realized they could be because they got through it. If they'd divorced, they would have thrown that away and their family would be broken. Life is long. Emotions are fickle. Their family is intact and their children are well adjusted independent adults. They have companionship in their old age. \n\nI think we're too shortsighted in general. It's not anger, truly, it's passion about something that is very, very wrong. I'm married and it's not always easy but I will never leave my husband. We are to expect difficulty in life. Marriage is a sacrificial act most of the time. People don't realize this.", "You don't assume anything but you're bringing in culture. Which culture are you talking about? How do you know that you share the same culture with OP or with me? \n\nAgain, great for your aunt and uncle but I disagree with having a marriage like this. As a child it was obvious that my parents didn't love each other and when no one was around it got extremely toxic. Life is long and why should you stay unhappy for the majority of it? I don't get it. I, personally, don't want to be in a relationship where someone doesn't love me. I think you're not recognizing that your passion and anger are just a step away from each other. \n\nYou already recognized that context matters - like an abusive relationship (not saying OP's daughter is in one) - not every marriage should continue.\n\nEdit: If you're interested [here](https://www.kleinattorneys.com/a-brief-history-of-marriage-and-until-death-do-us-part/) is the brief history of the sentence and how it made sense at the time but not nowadays.", "It seems like you think this is a moral or ethical issue, and that the rise of divorce somehow indicates a cultural failing. \n\nThere\u2019s really two historical factors for the rise of divorce rates: women\u2019s ability to have personal checking and banking accounts, and states making divorce no-fault. researchers at University of Pennsylvania found that while divorce rates initially rose in states where no-fault divorce laws were passed, those states also saw between an 8-16% drop in suicide rates among married women and a 30% drop in domestic violence.\n\nyou seem to like anecdotal evidence as well, so here\u2019s mine: my mother had your same mindset; I\u2019ve spent over 20 years in therapy for childhood abuse related to complex post traumatic stress disorder.\n\nnow, I realize that your counter argument is going to be that that doesn\u2019t apply to everyone, and you are right, but I\u2019m guessing it applies to a lot more than you probably think it does. And more importantly, what the availability of divorce showed women is that they do not have to stay in marriages where they are not happy. \n\nThere is no prize that you get for suffering and misery. Statistically, single women are the single happiest group of people in the United States."]}
