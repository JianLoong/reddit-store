We have been married coming up on 32 years soon. \n\nMy daughter was in a long relationship and married for approximately 9 years, and for a long time I thought that is was a good relationship, when out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband. \n\nWe were told it was a mutual decision, but that ultimately, he wasn\u2019t the greatest partner, and there were many things that she was not satisfied with in their relationship. So she wanted to leave. We supported her decision.\n\nAbout a year after the divorce, she introduced us to her new boyfriend. And while my husband and I thought it may be a bit early to date, we decided to continue to support her and meet him. He was, and is a very charming man who treats our daughter wonderfully, and you can tell she is extremely happy.\n\nNow to the argument. Recently, we were talking with one of our daughters friends who was visiting our town, and were discussing our daughters job and her wonderful boyfriend. Her friend in the conversation made a comment about how they were lucky to be in the same orientation together when they started work.\n\nAs soon as she saw our confused faces, she gave us the full story, as she realized we hadn\u2019t been given it. Our daughter had told us while her and her boyfriend worked for the same employer, they didn\u2019t meet until after the divorce.\n\nWe pressed the friend for more information, and she begrudgingly told us that our daughter and her boyfriend had met during orientation at work while our daughter was going through her marital issues. This led to them becoming closer and her filing for divorce from her ex husband about a year later.\n\nSo later that day, I asked to have a conversation with my daughter and brought up what her friend had told us. She turned white as snow, and basically confirmed her friends story. But reiterated that there was no physical cheating.\n\nI told her that physical cheating was not the only way that you could hurt someone. And that it appeared that she had emotionally cheated on her ex husband. He may not have been the greatest person, but it didn\u2019t excuse her actions. I told her that I was disappointed in her, and while I supported her leaving a bad marriage, that I couldn\u2019t look at her and her boyfriend the same in this new light in regards to cheating. I still love her and will treat her boyfriend with respect, but it is definitely something I have a hard time looking past.\n\nShe got angry with me for not continuing to support her in her journey beyond divorce. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683434794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ad4ht/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_im_disappointed/", "score": 370, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like she never truly confided in you with her marital issues, especially since you were shocked when she went to get a divorce...\n\n>out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband\n\nThat being said, you have no idea how bad things were for her or what she was really going through leading up to that and if she had a co-worker that she could confide in and that supported her, that's great, she deserves to have someone there who she could.  Marriages end long before the divorce is even requested most of the time and if that friendship and support turned into something more after, then good for her. \n\nYou're her mother, you can be disappointed and think you know better all you want, but pulling your support from her and talking down to a grown adult woman? YTA - she may be your child but she isn't a child anymore. It's her life and she deserves to be happy.", "YTA she divorced him for a reason. It\u2019s not like she strung her ex along she left him. And then a whole year later she got with her current bf.", "YTA. It's not your business, she isn't 20 years old.\n\nI'm 42 and don't really give a damn about my mother's opinion. Keep heading in that direction won't you.", "YTA. It is extraordinarily inappropriate and rude for you to think you have the right to decide whether or not your daughters divorce was justified.", "YTA kinda\n\nWhat would have had her do exactly? Like just run through the options here, she was in a marriage that she already wasn't happy with and she then went on to meet somebody she does love. So what was supposed to happen? She broke off her marriage so she didn't end up cheating, that seems like the right choice to me", "YTA.  None of the information the \u201cfriend\u201d told you was any of your business.  It\u2019s your daughter\u2019s life and it seems like there is a reason she didn\u2019t tell you any of this.", "YTA - how old is your daughter again? Seriously why are you sticking your nose into her business so much? It didn't work out, she found a confidant, things changed in her life. Don't be surprised if she eventually gets angry and \"suddenly\" goes no contact with you", "Marriages that fail are typically over long before the court declares it so. Your daughter\u2019s sounds as if it definitely fit that bill.\n\nWas she wrong to be emotionally invested somewhere else before the paperwork was done? Who knows. Maybe. But the bottom line is it isn\u2019t her new beau you should be judging for that, it is your daughter. \n\nNTA for being disappointed in her - potentially - bad timing. But not so clear cut on judgin the fella, again, is is her, not him, that should be holding to a standard.", "YTA. It must be nice living on high and judging other people for their lives when it has no impact on you whatsoever", "YTA. Relationships rarely end \"out of nowhere\". There are usually pretty obvious indicators that things are not as they should be. You missed those indicators, either because you weren't looking, or because your daughter didn't feel she could tell you. Given how you speak about your daughter (so reluctantly, so begrudgingly when it comes to her choices about her life), I definitely have my own opinion as to which of those it is.\n\nGiven that you thought your daughter's marriage ended \"out of nowhere\", it seems as though you don't really know a whole lot of detail about your daughter's relationships - not her previous marriage, not the one she is in now. Despite this, you've decided to make some assumptions about her behaviour, without confirming with her exactly what happened, or considering for even a moment why she might feel the need to withhold information from you.\n\nI'd be hesitant to tell you anything about this too. You've jumped straight to \"my daughter is a lying cheater!\" based on \"appears\" to be the case. I bet this isn't the first time, and without any reflection on your part, it may not be the last one either.", "YTA. You have no business judging something you know nothing about. There is not a marriage in the world that has ended out of nowhere. To me, it sounds just like your daughter sees you for who you really are - a meddling, judgmental person with nothing nice to say. Of course you are on information diet, you can not seem to fathom there are literally hundreds of possible things that could have gone wrong in their marriage. Maybe he cheated! Maybe no one cheated. Maybe they just grew apart. Point is, YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT OUT. You literally had 10% of the story and a lot of imagination for the other part.", "Wow... just, wow. YTA.\n\n1. You think dating someone new a year after a divorce is somehow \"too soon.\" *What*? \n2. You admit that you know that your daughter had \"martial issues\" before she met this new guy, yet you've drawn the conclusion that he was somehow a part of her filing for divorce because she was \"emotionally\" cheating on her husband. Again, *what*?\n3. You concede her husband was a bad partner (while omitting any information on why/how he was a bad partner), but then said it didn't \"excuse\" her actions. What actions does she need to excuse, OP? Talking to a new friend who happens to be male?\n\nYou claim you support her choice to leave a bad marriage. Did it not occur to you, OP, that your daughter filed for divorce when she met a man who - as a friend - treated her with the respect and care that she had always wanted from her husband but hadn't ever gotten? Did it occur to you that maybe meeting him showed her that she didn't have to settle for what she had been living with?\n\nShe clearly lied to you about it because she knew this is how you'd react. Are you even disappointed with your daughter, OP? Are you sure the disappointment isn't with yourself?", "YTA\n\nYou're dredging up something that happened years ago to berate your daughter? Perhaps this is exactly the reason she doesn't confide in you, she can't bear your judgemental moral superiority. Enjoy the view from your high horse, I hope you don't fall off it...", "YTA.  I started to say ESH assuming your daughter lied to her husband about her relationship or feelings towards the guy from work.  But I don\u2019t know that.  She may have been upfront with him.  Her friends knew so maybe he did too.  Did it ever occur to you that maybe she didn\u2019t tell you specifically for a reason? \n\nYour daughter doesn\u2019t really owe you an explanation about the demise of her marriage.  That is between her and her husband.  My guess is that based on some of your comments (a year after a divorce is too soon to start dating?)your views on relationships are far more conservative than hers and she didn\u2019t want the drama talking about it with you would entail.  Remember telling a child you are \u201cdisappointed\u201d in them, while terribly cruel, could be effective in controlling a child.  But your daughter is an adult. Your \u201cdiss appointment\u201d probably only results in her confiding in you even less than she does already.", "\"Daughter, I'm so very disappointed in you for seeking happiness. How dare you meet someone you'd eventually fall in love with and get with over a year after your divorce from a man who just couldn't treat you right or make you happy. I absolutely cannot support your happiness.\"\n\nYes, you're the fucking asshole. YTA big time.", "YTA.  \u201cEmotional cheating\u201d is ill-defined nonsense used to punish people for making a connection with someone.", "YTA an over-involved and judgemental one. She's not a kid, it's none of your business. And her \"friend\" is an AH too for telling a story that was none of her business to tell.", "YTA it's her life mum.", "YTA. Get out of your daughter's business.", "Why bring it up at all? It\u2019s been done with and over, it\u2019s in the past, she\u2019s with who she\u2019s with, and while you\u2019ll always be her parent, you stepped out of line here because she\u2019s a grown woman. It was enough to tell her you know, and you should\u2019ve left it at that.", "YTA, doesn't sound like she did a damn thing wrong, you're just pissed she didn't sit around all mopey and chaste for the time she was getting a divorce. grow the fuck up. you're 55. plenty old enough to know adult relationships aren't always easy. \n\nyour post is insanely judgemental and you owe your daughter several apologies. \"too soon\" after more than a year, like come ON", "NTA. I think that is a fair response, and I would feel similarly about learning a loved one may have cheated. Loving someone does not and should not equal excusing all their behavior.", "NTA", "I\u2019m honestly a bit surprised by the judgments and think if this was someone else in the daughter\u2019s life, the judgments would be opposite. Or even if it was one of the parents who left a marriage the same way and the daughter found out. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t actually sound that judgmental to me. They supported daughter\u2019s decision to divorce at first and didn\u2019t know the details. Daughter not telling the details doesn\u2019t really indicate much about their relationship - I know a lot of people super private about those things even in non-cheating circumstances or circumstances where parents aren\u2019t controlling and judgmental, a lot of ended marriages people are shocked by, etc. If anything, most people I know go out of their way to paint their relationships rosy af to everyone until they literally can\u2019t. It also doesn\u2019t seem that judgmental that parents thought it was soon for her to be dating - it doesn\u2019t sound like they expressed it, and it\u2019s a sentiment a *lot* of people have after relationships end (including on this sub). And honestly, if her marriage was that horrible, she probably should have taken some time to herself to work through it and get therapy instead of jumping straight into another relationship. \n\nIn short, the most judgmental things in the post look like things privately thought rather than expressed, and it seems *in actions* they did support their daughter. \n\nThe most AH thing I see OP doing is jumping to conclusions about emotional cheating before asking more questions about the circumstances, such as how bad the marriage was before she met the new guy, etc. But I can even see *why* this happened as they found out she blatantly lied. That doesn\u2019t paint a positive picture, and they were probably still reeling from the discovery of being lied to. There\u2019s little I hate more than being lied to and it\u2019s honestly the number one way to turn me against someone even in situations I\u2019d normally be sympathetic. \n\nThe worst judgment I can see for this is E S H based on the combo of daughter lying and parents jumping to said conclusions without more info/inquiring and hearing more of the story. But I\u2019m still landing on NTA unless there\u2019s missing info. I\u2019d have a hard time not being disappointed in their shoes, too.", "NTA.  How incredibly disappointing to find out that your daughter is a cheater and a liar and a gaslighter to boot. None of the other people who\u2019ve posted \u201cYTA\u201d knows what that\u2019s like.  Your daughter hid this relationship from you and lied to you. She didn\u2019t just cheat on her husband, she cheated on you too.  That\u2019s what hurts.  \n\nTake some space from your daughter.  You don\u2019t need to tell her you are doing that though, just be busy for a while as you grieve the death of the image you had of your daughter, who you thought could do no wrong. \n\nEventually maybe you can have a more honest relationship with her, snow that you know she is just a person and not a shining angel.", "Very light ESH, it sounds like she has left out some information on how she met her boyfriend, and it seems there are some assumptions you\u2019re making on the nature of their relationship during that first year before she became divorced. I do think you need to give her the opportunity to explain. \n\nOther than that, what you said sounds perfectly reasonable, you\u2019re not telling her to break up or anything ridiculous like that. I would just confirm the situation in case it genuinely wasn\u2019t like that.", "Are you a parent or a judge. Because the two are quite different things. If you're a parent then unconditional love is the order of the day. If you're a judge then yes judge away. But don't expect to be confided in, trusted or respected.", "YTA and way too enmeshed in a grown woman's love life.  Like to a creepy and unhealthy degree.", "YTA, it\u2018s none of your business and \u201echeating\u201c means something different for every couple. Your daughter behaved respectfully by not cheating physically, divorcing and waiting a year to officialise the new relationship.

Even if she developed feelings for the co-worker and that contributed to the divorce, it seems like they didn't get together for a good while later.", "Got'em.  So many people on this sub just jump to YTA without any thought or empathy.  It very well could have been out of nowhere.  The daughter admits to lying and emotionally cheating.   She probably knew she was going to be judged because what she did was wrong and she knew it.\n\nI've been the \"work husband\" because my coworkers husband essentially treated her like how you'd imagine a wife was treated portraying the 1950's.  We started to get close because she always wanted to go out for lunch when she was pregnant, literally everyday, and I also like to go out for lunch.  I was single, rented a cheap apartment and was essentially living the bachelor life so $15-20 a day for lunch wasn't a concern for me.  She'd refer to me as her work husband and she was my work wife.  At first I was fine with it but things started to kind of go over the top.  It was little things like not correcting someone who asked when we were expecting or if the baby was a boy or a girl.  Then she asked me about names I'd name a kid and I made it clear I never planned on having any of my own but she insisted, so I told her a boy and girl name from my family that had meaning to my family.  She decided to push her husband to go with one of those names and he had no idea why.  When she announced the baby, the babies first name was what I said I'd go with and the middle name was my first name.  When I asked her about this she could have just said she liked it and said I didn't plan on using it anyway but, she said her work husband was going to be a big part of the babies life and wanted me to be the godfather.  It got real awkward real fast.  She didn't come back to work after I declined to be the godfather for numerous reasons.  Mainly I'm a single guy and both her and her husband have family in the area that would be far better suited than I would be.\n\nTLDR:  I apparently like food as much as pregnant women and became the \"work husband\" to a coworker that went too far in my mind.", "She didn't cheat, though. She developed a friendship which she may well have wanted to pursue further when her marriage was already failing, then filed for divorce and started a new relationship.", "When did the daughter cheat? OP is making some huge assumptions here, with very little actual info.\n\nI wonder why the daughter wouldn\u2019t tell her everything?", "We all judge things all the time. OP is here asking for judgement. We are here because we like to render judgements. One of the few people on earth most likely to know a person's character and have *some* right to judge someone's behavior is their mother. Maybe it is none of Mom's business, but daughter went out of her way to tell Mom specific things and ask for support in her divorce, then it comes out daughter wasn't telling the full truth. OP is allowed to be disappointed in her daughter. You sound like you're the kind of person who is so *non-judgemental* that you wouldn't tell a friend they're being cheated on because it's none of your business -- which is certainly your right! But not everyone feels that way.", "You mean like, they had a deeper connection with someone else but kept you strung along in the domestic arrangement for practical reasons?  (Just clarifying)", "Still is considered emotional cheating which is almost worse then physical cheating. If you can\u2019t love someone whole heartedly without just meeting someone new and being attracted to them for different qualities then who  you are with now you should have never married the person. You are wrong. People can fall in love, just not while in a relationship with others, it is still cheating.", "Emotional cheating makes sense in the context of you having an established monogamous relationship with your partner with no egregious issues in it and then, instead of doing the non-sexual but intimate things expected of a spousal couple with your partner, you do it with a third party, while keeping your partner out of the loop and unaware of what's going on with that third party.\n\nPeople do it. It can be intentional, or selfish, or accidental. But realizing you've fallen out of love with your current partner is one thing when your choices are plod along with them because you're both used to it or go ahead with your life alone, and it's a whole other issue when that lack of love is highlighted by the love (or in some cases, the high/power trip) you develop for someone else. That's when you have the choices of emotional cheating and, like you said, \"acting with respect\"\n\nReminds me of that AITA post where that OP kept getting her \"work husband\" snacks tailored to his keto diet and he kept saying no in all ways except directly. If he'd accepted them regularly, bonding with her over them, and hidden the fact from his wife, after all the other unsaid, implied nonsense from OP, that would have been some level of emotional cheating, imo", "This. It\u2019s not like falling in love is a conscious decision.", "What does your story have to do with this? Bcs ain't no where written here that they called each other these dumb work husband/work wife titles.\nAll that was said and confirmed was that they got along quite well, didn't catch feelings until later and she also only built more close contact WHILST the martial issues (as I guess, the divorce process) was already on going.\n\nThat isn't even emotional cheating.", "You\u2019re projecting. The daughter didn\u2019t admit to emotional cheating, that was the mothers assumption. We\u2019d have no way to judge the daughter posting similarly because we have a fraction of the info, not least what actually caused her to leave her marriage.", "Yeah two of my coworkers recently started dating, they have worked together for years with neither married so they could have got together before if they wanted to. It wasn't emotional between them although he has liked her for a while, she got out of an abusive relationship last year and just sees guys differently now and the slightly nerdy guy who treats her well is what she wants now compared to the guys she used to date.", "Pretty much. He made no secret that they were close. I could tell he liked her a lot and she liked him. He confided in her, trusted her, over me. It sucked. I tried to talk to him about it but he just dismissed it. We weren't married thank goodness, so I left.", "Op will never be able to trust there wasn't something worth hiding, because if there wasn't something worth hiding she would have told the parents they started at work at the same time herself.", "I see you're unfamiliar with the concepts of \"nuance\" and \"life is complex; shit happens; we deal as best we can\"\n\nOP and you will be besties", "But you can't control that though? It's not like you can actively decide when you fall in love romantically. You can love someone with full heart and still fall for someone else. There is no relationship where I can't say I didn't love fully, because I did. Each time. \n\nThis also alienates victims of abuse who are too terrified to leave their partner for their own safety and well being. Sometimes they need that safety need to be able to leave and land somewhere else on their feet.\n\nIt's not a crime to fall in love with someone else during a relationship and then ending it when you realize it. What are those people supposed to do? Stay in a relationship where they don't love the person anymore and this becoming eventually more damaging for both parties, because the other will feel it and when they find out why, the fallout is worse more often than not. \n\nFrom friends this happened to, all of them said they wished their ex partner had ended it immediately when instead of staying and playing a role, because of societies expectation that makes people feel trapped and ashamed for their feelings.\n\nEdit: for the last part, my friends ex partners never were romantically involved with the other party either. It was just them loving someone else and not my friends anymore, but their surroundings and society made them afraid and ashamed to leave. So they stayed with my friends longer than they should have and it has caused massive trust issues for some of my friends, because they stayed with them even though they didn't love them anymore.", "Fucking what?", "If you realise you 'never should have married the person' then surely divorce is the best option?", "I find it hard to believe they didn't have feelings until late when the daughter already admitted to lying about how and when they met.  Then they immediately started dating like a switch flipped when the ink was dry.", "I\u2019d be interested to know whether people would be so forgiving of the \u2018cheating\u2019 if this was about OP\u2019s *son* leaving his wife for someone he met at work\u2026", "I'm new to the sub, but \"emotional cheating\" would never be a thing. Only physical cheating. Since that isn't confirmed in this situation, OP is TA. Divorcing to get with someone else by default implies you were in the marriage when falling in love with that someone else. To avoid cheating, you divorce. Sounds honorable and decent to me. Everything else is just hazy slut shaming- for men or women alike.", "marriage is till death do us part, not \"till I get bored, refuse to address common marital problems, or someone prettier shows up in my life\"", "OP is in her right. If this was reversed and a man had divorced his wife and gotten with someone from work everyone would stand up and clap for OP because it\u2019d be emotional cheating. But noooo we have to empower women and give objective double standards because only they can be in abusive relationships /s. This comment section is a joke.", "Of course the daughter would lie to the mother when the mother is THIS judging.\nA coworker/friend that isn't in on the mother's judging told the story as it really happened. Did you skip that part?\n\nThat that friend told this is in my eyes really credible, and the story that the friend told (which was then confirmed by the daughter) imo isn't emotional nor physical cheating.", "If he didn't physically cheat (i.e. have sex with her) while in the marriage, my vote wouldn't change. The spouse's sex doesn't factor in this judgment. \n\nWhat could potentially complicate things is if there are children in the marriage. And even then, that hinges on whether the kids would end up being in a bad environment with one spouse unhappy in the marriage.", "They had marriage issues before she met the new boyfriend if you read the post. And it's unrealistic to say till death do us apart - so according to this logic people in abusive marriage have to stay until death?", "If you feel that strongly about it, I sincerely hope this situation never happens to you. I don't think you'd be able to cope. Have a great rest of the weekend, friend-o", "I did, and marriage issues can mean almost anything. You're also putting words into my mouth and going to the extreme. I never said anything about abusive relationships. It doesn't sound like daughter was being abused at all, she just found some eye candy, said her husband sucked, and left him. We know nothing else. What if he was going through a difficult time? What if he was just living his life and had no idea she was \"unhappy\" because she never said anything? What if she sucks and didn't put any effort into the marriage for selfish reasons, expecting him to make her happy instead of caring about his happiness at all? You don't know. But like most of the other YTAs, you're screaming marriage issues means divorce is totally fine. This is why everyone is in dysfunctional relationships and kids are being carted between multiple houses.", "You assume a lot about OP's daughter and I think you're projecting your own experiences onto her (read your comments). \n\nNo, I don't think marriage issues = divorce. \nI believe if you don't love someone anymore you don't stay in a loveless relationship. Not just for the person who fell out of love but especially for the person who maybe still is. \n\nYou sound really angry and I think this is something you have to work on.\n\nEdit: you also don't stay in a relationship just for the kids. That's worse than divorce. That's my opinion because I lived through this scenario."]}
