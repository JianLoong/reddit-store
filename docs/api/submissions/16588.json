We have been married coming up on 32 years soon. \n\nMy daughter was in a long relationship and married for approximately 9 years, and for a long time I thought that is was a good relationship, when out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband. \n\nWe were told it was a mutual decision, but that ultimately, he wasn\u2019t the greatest partner, and there were many things that she was not satisfied with in their relationship. So she wanted to leave. We supported her decision.\n\nAbout a year after the divorce, she introduced us to her new boyfriend. And while my husband and I thought it may be a bit early to date, we decided to continue to support her and meet him. He was, and is a very charming man who treats our daughter wonderfully, and you can tell she is extremely happy.\n\nNow to the argument. Recently, we were talking with one of our daughters friends who was visiting our town, and were discussing our daughters job and her wonderful boyfriend. Her friend in the conversation made a comment about how they were lucky to be in the same orientation together when they started work.\n\nAs soon as she saw our confused faces, she gave us the full story, as she realized we hadn\u2019t been given it. Our daughter had told us while her and her boyfriend worked for the same employer, they didn\u2019t meet until after the divorce.\n\nWe pressed the friend for more information, and she begrudgingly told us that our daughter and her boyfriend had met during orientation at work while our daughter was going through her marital issues. This led to them becoming closer and her filing for divorce from her ex husband about a year later.\n\nSo later that day, I asked to have a conversation with my daughter and brought up what her friend had told us. She turned white as snow, and basically confirmed her friends story. But reiterated that there was no physical cheating.\n\nI told her that physical cheating was not the only way that you could hurt someone. And that it appeared that she had emotionally cheated on her ex husband. He may not have been the greatest person, but it didn\u2019t excuse her actions. I told her that I was disappointed in her, and while I supported her leaving a bad marriage, that I couldn\u2019t look at her and her boyfriend the same in this new light in regards to cheating. I still love her and will treat her boyfriend with respect, but it is definitely something I have a hard time looking past.\n\nShe got angry with me for not continuing to support her in her journey beyond divorce. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683434794, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ad4ht/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_that_im_disappointed/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like she never truly confided in you with her marital issues, especially since you were shocked when she went to get a divorce...\n\n>out of nowhere around 3 years ago, she decided to divorce her ex-husband\n\nThat being said, you have no idea how bad things were for her or what she was really going through leading up to that and if she had a co-worker that she could confide in and that supported her, that's great, she deserves to have someone there who she could.  Marriages end long before the divorce is even requested most of the time and if that friendship and support turned into something more after, then good for her. \n\nYou're her mother, you can be disappointed and think you know better all you want, but pulling your support from her and talking down to a grown adult woman? YTA - she may be your child but she isn't a child anymore. It's her life and she deserves to be happy.", "YTA she divorced him for a reason. It\u2019s not like she strung her ex along she left him. And then a whole year later she got with her current bf.", "YTA. It's not your business, she isn't 20 years old.\n\nI'm 42 and don't really give a damn about my mother's opinion. Keep heading in that direction won't you.", "YTA. It is extraordinarily inappropriate and rude for you to think you have the right to decide whether or not your daughters divorce was justified.", "YTA kinda\n\nWhat would have had her do exactly? Like just run through the options here, she was in a marriage that she already wasn't happy with and she then went on to meet somebody she does love. So what was supposed to happen? She broke off her marriage so she didn't end up cheating, that seems like the right choice to me", "YTA.  None of the information the \u201cfriend\u201d told you was any of your business.  It\u2019s your daughter\u2019s life and it seems like there is a reason she didn\u2019t tell you any of this.", "YTA - how old is your daughter again? Seriously why are you sticking your nose into her business so much? It didn't work out, she found a confidant, things changed in her life. Don't be surprised if she eventually gets angry and \"suddenly\" goes no contact with you", "Marriages that fail are typically over long before the court declares it so. Your daughter\u2019s sounds as if it definitely fit that bill.\n\nWas she wrong to be emotionally invested somewhere else before the paperwork was done? Who knows. Maybe. But the bottom line is it isn\u2019t her new beau you should be judging for that, it is your daughter. \n\nNTA for being disappointed in her - potentially - bad timing. But not so clear cut on judgin the fella, again, is is her, not him, that should be holding to a standard.", "YTA. It must be nice living on high and judging other people for their lives when it has no impact on you whatsoever", "YTA. Relationships rarely end \"out of nowhere\". There are usually pretty obvious indicators that things are not as they should be. You missed those indicators, either because you weren't looking, or because your daughter didn't feel she could tell you. Given how you speak about your daughter (so reluctantly, so begrudgingly when it comes to her choices about her life), I definitely have my own opinion as to which of those it is.\n\nGiven that you thought your daughter's marriage ended \"out of nowhere\", it seems as though you don't really know a whole lot of detail about your daughter's relationships - not her previous marriage, not the one she is in now. Despite this, you've decided to make some assumptions about her behaviour, without confirming with her exactly what happened, or considering for even a moment why she might feel the need to withhold information from you.\n\nI'd be hesitant to tell you anything about this too. You've jumped straight to \"my daughter is a lying cheater!\" based on \"appears\" to be the case. I bet this isn't the first time, and without any reflection on your part, it may not be the last one either.", "YTA. You have no business judging something you know nothing about. There is not a marriage in the world that has ended out of nowhere. To me, it sounds just like your daughter sees you for who you really are - a meddling, judgmental person with nothing nice to say. Of course you are on information diet, you can not seem to fathom there are literally hundreds of possible things that could have gone wrong in their marriage. Maybe he cheated! Maybe no one cheated. Maybe they just grew apart. Point is, YOU DON'T KNOW. BUT OUT. You literally had 10% of the story and a lot of imagination for the other part.", "Wow... just, wow. YTA.\n\n1. You think dating someone new a year after a divorce is somehow \"too soon.\" *What*? \n2. You admit that you know that your daughter had \"martial issues\" before she met this new guy, yet you've drawn the conclusion that he was somehow a part of her filing for divorce because she was \"emotionally\" cheating on her husband. Again, *what*?\n3. You concede her husband was a bad partner (while omitting any information on why/how he was a bad partner), but then said it didn't \"excuse\" her actions. What actions does she need to excuse, OP? Talking to a new friend who happens to be male?\n\nYou claim you support her choice to leave a bad marriage. Did it not occur to you, OP, that your daughter filed for divorce when she met a man who - as a friend - treated her with the respect and care that she had always wanted from her husband but hadn't ever gotten? Did it occur to you that maybe meeting him showed her that she didn't have to settle for what she had been living with?\n\nShe clearly lied to you about it because she knew this is how you'd react. Are you even disappointed with your daughter, OP? Are you sure the disappointment isn't with yourself?", "YTA\n\nYou're dredging up something that happened years ago to berate your daughter? Perhaps this is exactly the reason she doesn't confide in you, she can't bear your judgemental moral superiority. Enjoy the view from your high horse, I hope you don't fall off it...", "YTA.  I started to say ESH assuming your daughter lied to her husband about her relationship or feelings towards the guy from work.  But I don\u2019t know that.  She may have been upfront with him.  Her friends knew so maybe he did too.  Did it ever occur to you that maybe she didn\u2019t tell you specifically for a reason? \n\nYour daughter doesn\u2019t really owe you an explanation about the demise of her marriage.  That is between her and her husband.  My guess is that based on some of your comments (a year after a divorce is too soon to start dating?)your views on relationships are far more conservative than hers and she didn\u2019t want the drama talking about it with you would entail.  Remember telling a child you are \u201cdisappointed\u201d in them, while terribly cruel, could be effective in controlling a child.  But your daughter is an adult. Your \u201cdiss appointment\u201d probably only results in her confiding in you even less than she does already.", "\"Daughter, I'm so very disappointed in you for seeking happiness. How dare you meet someone you'd eventually fall in love with and get with over a year after your divorce from a man who just couldn't treat you right or make you happy. I absolutely cannot support your happiness.\"\n\nYes, you're the fucking asshole. YTA big time.", "YTA.  \u201cEmotional cheating\u201d is ill-defined nonsense used to punish people for making a connection with someone.", "YTA an over-involved and judgemental one. She's not a kid, it's none of your business. And her \"friend\" is an AH too for telling a story that was none of her business to tell.", "YTA it's her life mum.", "YTA. Get out of your daughter's business.", "Why bring it up at all? It\u2019s been done with and over, it\u2019s in the past, she\u2019s with who she\u2019s with, and while you\u2019ll always be her parent, you stepped out of line here because she\u2019s a grown woman. It was enough to tell her you know, and you should\u2019ve left it at that.", "YTA, doesn't sound like she did a damn thing wrong, you're just pissed she didn't sit around all mopey and chaste for the time she was getting a divorce. grow the fuck up. you're 55. plenty old enough to know adult relationships aren't always easy. \n\nyour post is insanely judgemental and you owe your daughter several apologies. \"too soon\" after more than a year, like come ON", "NTA. I think that is a fair response, and I would feel similarly about learning a loved one may have cheated. Loving someone does not and should not equal excusing all their behavior.", "NTA", "I\u2019m honestly a bit surprised by the judgments and think if this was someone else in the daughter\u2019s life, the judgments would be opposite. Or even if it was one of the parents who left a marriage the same way and the daughter found out. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t actually sound that judgmental to me. They supported daughter\u2019s decision to divorce at first and didn\u2019t know the details. Daughter not telling the details doesn\u2019t really indicate much about their relationship - I know a lot of people super private about those things even in non-cheating circumstances or circumstances where parents aren\u2019t controlling and judgmental, a lot of ended marriages people are shocked by, etc. If anything, most people I know go out of their way to paint their relationships rosy af to everyone until they literally can\u2019t. It also doesn\u2019t seem that judgmental that parents thought it was soon for her to be dating - it doesn\u2019t sound like they expressed it, and it\u2019s a sentiment a *lot* of people have after relationships end (including on this sub). And honestly, if her marriage was that horrible, she probably should have taken some time to herself to work through it and get therapy instead of jumping straight into another relationship. \n\nIn short, the most judgmental things in the post look like things privately thought rather than expressed, and it seems *in actions* they did support their daughter. \n\nThe most AH thing I see OP doing is jumping to conclusions about emotional cheating before asking more questions about the circumstances, such as how bad the marriage was before she met the new guy, etc. But I can even see *why* this happened as they found out she blatantly lied. That doesn\u2019t paint a positive picture, and they were probably still reeling from the discovery of being lied to. There\u2019s little I hate more than being lied to and it\u2019s honestly the number one way to turn me against someone even in situations I\u2019d normally be sympathetic. \n\nThe worst judgment I can see for this is E S H based on the combo of daughter lying and parents jumping to said conclusions without more info/inquiring and hearing more of the story. But I\u2019m still landing on NTA unless there\u2019s missing info. I\u2019d have a hard time not being disappointed in their shoes, too.", "NTA.  How incredibly disappointing to find out that your daughter is a cheater and a liar and a gaslighter to boot. None of the other people who\u2019ve posted \u201cYTA\u201d knows what that\u2019s like.  Your daughter hid this relationship from you and lied to you. She didn\u2019t just cheat on her husband, she cheated on you too.  That\u2019s what hurts.  \n\nTake some space from your daughter.  You don\u2019t need to tell her you are doing that though, just be busy for a while as you grieve the death of the image you had of your daughter, who you thought could do no wrong. \n\nEventually maybe you can have a more honest relationship with her, snow that you know she is just a person and not a shining angel.", "Very light ESH, it sounds like she has left out some information on how she met her boyfriend, and it seems there are some assumptions you\u2019re making on the nature of their relationship during that first year before she became divorced. I do think you need to give her the opportunity to explain. \n\nOther than that, what you said sounds perfectly reasonable, you\u2019re not telling her to break up or anything ridiculous like that. I would just confirm the situation in case it genuinely wasn\u2019t like that.", "Are you a parent or a judge. Because the two are quite different things. If you're a parent then unconditional love is the order of the day. If you're a judge then yes judge away. But don't expect to be confided in, trusted or respected.", "YTA and way too enmeshed in a grown woman's love life.  Like to a creepy and unhealthy degree.", "YTA, it\u2018s none of your business and \u201echeating\u201c means something different for every couple. Your daughter behaved respectfully by not cheating physically, divorcing and waiting a year to officialise the new relationship. And even if this wouldn\u2018t have been the case, your job as a parent isn\u2018t to morally judge your child\u2018s actions.", "YTA. Having been in a similar position to your daughter, with no cheating involved, you cannot begin to imagine how much the unfair and uniformed judgements from people you thought you could rely on hurt.

YTA for butting in when you have no idea what is going on in her life or either or her relationships.", "INFO:\n\nYour daughter is 30 years and divorced 3 years ago, after a 9 year marriage. Did she marry at 18?", "NTA - i am so surprised by all the votes.  If she was unhappy and he was a bad husband, then she should have divorced him first.  Not get involved with someone else and then get the courage to leave.  For anyone that has been betrayed, this is the fundamental break of trust that occurs and then the cheaters justify their leaving because the spouse was bad etc. I understand your disappointment, and while it does not sound judgy to me - its fine to share your thoughts.  Bottom line - she lied to you, and hid the facts from you - because she knew it was wrong.", "Yeah, this is it. \n\n\"Emotional cheating\" is so nebulous imo. \nLike, sure, if your daughter spent months sending flirty chats and saucy pics to her colleague, while merely grunting at her then-husband if he tried to be romantic... that's pretty bad.\nAt the same time, maybe she brought up housekeeping to her then-husband, and he responded by \"waffle stomping\". In that case, totally understandable she found her emotions resonated more with another man. \n\nShe didn't confide in you back then, she only confided in you under duress now. \n\nWhat do you gain by sitting in judgement over her, and what do you lose by expressing your baseless disappointment?\nLike, she's your daughter.
