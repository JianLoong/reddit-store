Or if the clothes were expensive and ruined or something like that.\n\nKids getting dirty at that age is normal and for them its really fun, but you have to return them cleaned up *and* in clean clothes.  The OP had kids that age, knew what happens when they get into stuff like this and really should have known that a dirty kid and dirty clothes would have resulted.  The OP tried their best but, it wasn't ideal so slight AH there.\n\nI also think that there was a general failure by both the OP and her sister to predict the need for a spare set of clothes.

Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA - your sister is a major AH here though.  I\u2019m not a fan of mess but have 3 kids so I let it go cause creativity is awesome, if one of my siblings let one of my kids freely be creative and messy at their places though they\u2019d get a medal for best babysitter of that year!", "NTA - friend and I had daughters 5 days apart. They were about 2 and I'd gone to my friends house  We lived in different states and I'd come home to visit.\n\nWe made chocolate chip cookies. I sat my daughter in a chair, took her shirt off, and handed her a cookie.

That's the privilege of being an aunt, uncle, grandparent, etc. You get to get them gross, although you did attempt to clean up, and feed them what mom and dad don't.

You cleaned up the child and put them right back into the dirty clothes. **You only fixed half the mess you made**. Now I have that mess getting into my car as a bonus?

They're kids!! Was the child dressed for a pageant or a formal affair when she was dropped off? Did the mom say, don't let her get dirty as we are going to a formal affair when I pick her up? Some parents are so uptight about kids getting dirty nowadays....I have a son who yells at his two boys constantly to not get dirty, that what they are wearing cost a lot of money so get off the ground, or don't get anything on that shirt, it was expensive. I don't understand it because I didn't raise the kids that way. They had play clothes and they had school/dress clothes. Being home and playing required play clothes. Going out to dinner or going to school meant dress clothes. Even if they were wearing their good clothes, accidents could happen....being out to dinner might result in something getting on a shirt or pants. Even I get things on myself sometimes! I feel bad for the little girl in this situation....she enjoyed herself, I'm sure (who doesn't love glitter!) and I feel bad for the OP. She did a nice thing for her sister and got punished for it.

When play was finished, they were bathed, their hair dressed and put back into the designer clothes. They absolutely loved it. They never got the chance to play with anything wet or messy anywhere else. They didn't even own wellies. They had never jumped in a puddle, or anything like that. Essentially they were dolls for the mother to dress.\n\nThe parents never realised. It never occurred to them to ask the girls what they had been doing during the day. As long as they were clean and nicely dressed, and didn't make a noise, or disturb their parents in any way, (like, God Forbid, talking to them!) The parents were satisfied.\n\nI asked the Nanny how the couple that she was working for felt about all this.  She said that they had plenty of money, they felt sorry for the girls, who were friends with their two, and didn't object to the Nanny looking after them as well.\n\n They even invited the other family to go on holiday with them, free of charge, with the Nanny taking care of all four. \nThey arrived with suitcases full of completely inappropriate clothes for the girls.\nSince the only time that they saw their daughters was when they were in their nightdresses to say goodnight, they never realised that the beautiful designer dresses spent the fortnight hung nicely in a wardrobe.\n\nUnfortunately I have come across a lot of parents who see their children as accessories, and accessories don't have needs", "We have them\u2026 those are the clothes my baby never wore because he was born big and we skipped the first size\u2026", "Hahaha lol I laughed way too hard :\u2019)", ">my show suitcase still throws orange sparkle herpes at me over a decade later\n\nSparkle herpes, that made me laugh way too hard. Love it.", "That was one trick my mom taught me about giving gifts for a baby shower. Get some basic easy to clean stuff one or two size up from newborns. Tho tbf none of my family starts at \u201cnewborn\u201d size", "Or aita for being upset with my MIL for forcing me to wash her son\u2019s clothes?"]}
