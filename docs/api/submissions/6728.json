Or if the clothes were expensive and ruined or something like that.\n\nKids getting dirty at that age is normal and for them its really fun, but you have to return them cleaned up *and* in clean clothes.  The OP had kids that age, knew what happens when they get into stuff like this and really should have known that a dirty kid and dirty clothes would have resulted.  The OP tried their best but, it wasn't ideal so slight AH there.\n\nI also think that there was a general failure by both the OP and her sister to predict the need for a spare set of clothes.

Nothing wrong with that.", "NTA - your sister is a major AH here though.  I\u2019m not a fan of mess but have 3 kids so I let it go cause creativity is awesome, if one of my siblings let one of my kids freely be creative and messy at their places though they\u2019d get a medal for best babysitter of that year!", "NTA - friend and I had daughters 5 days apart. They were about 2 and I'd gone to my friends house  We lived in different states and I'd come home to visit.\n\nWe made chocolate chip cookies. I sat my daughter in a chair, took her shirt off, and handed her a cookie.

That's the privilege of being an aunt, uncle, grandparent, etc. You get to get them gross, although you did attempt to clean up, and feed them what mom and dad don't.

At the same time sometimes I skip it and there are times where I would be pissed if it was done while she was being baby sat. What if they had plans after she was picked up?

You cleaned up the child and put them right back into the dirty clothes. **You only fixed half the mess you made**. Now I have that mess getting into my car as a bonus?

They're kids!! Was the child dressed for a pageant or a formal affair when she was dropped off? Did the mom say, don't let her get dirty as we are going to a formal affair when I pick her up? Some parents are so uptight about kids getting dirty nowadays....I have a son who yells at his two boys constantly to not get dirty, that what they are wearing cost a lot of money so get off the ground, or don't get anything on that shirt, it was expensive. I don't understand it because I didn't raise the kids that way. They had play clothes and they had school/dress clothes. Being home and playing required play clothes. Going out to dinner or going to school meant dress clothes. Even if they were wearing their good clothes, accidents could happen....being out to dinner might result in something getting on a shirt or pants. Even I get things on myself sometimes! I feel bad for the little girl in this situation....she enjoyed herself, I'm sure (who doesn't love glitter!) and I feel bad for the OP. She did a nice thing for her sister and got punished for it.

But she walked in right in the middle of mess making. She was cool about it. I offered to clean up and bathe him as planned, but she told me not to worry about it.\n\nNTA. Unless the parent specified not to let her get dirty, I\u2019d be happy as a parent that my kid had fun and was occupied doing something other than tv or video games.", "NTA. Your niece had a wonderful time and you were willing to bath her and wash her clothes. Your sister is a lousy parent if she puts clothing and hair that can be washed over her child having fun. \n\nIn addition to art projects, a couple of times a week in warm weather My toddlers got two kiddie pools - one with water and one with dirt. Toy trucks and cars drove the \u201croads\u201d they (girls) made, toys floated or drowned, mud pies were made, they \u201chelped \u201c me work in the garden. They had a grand time. I then Hosed the worst of the muck off, wrapped them in towels to keep drips off the floors, then gave baths to wash hair. Kids NEED fun playtime, however messy!\n\nAnd they slept better at night when worn out. Win - win.", "Exactly, she should be grateful that you kept her child engaged and occupied without turning her into a zombie in front of a screen.\n\nGetting glitter out of kids and clothes isn\u2019t even as bad as the mess she likely made at your house.  Your sister is being ridiculous.", "My babysitter sometimes apologizes because the kids are filthy when we pick them up. I always tell her \u201cthe dirtier the kid, the better the day!\u201d \n\nI\u2019d 100% rather have my kids full of dirt and glue and glitter than immaculate at the end of the day.", "This. She says this now but I'm willing to bet down the line, she'll want another favor. Remind her how she acted the last time you did her one.", "My friend is an elementary art teacher and hates parents like this. Her favorite was a parent that screamed at her because the acrylic paint they were using \"wrecked\" her daughter's $60 manicure.\n\nLike ma'am, you're kind of the idiot for spending $60 on a first grader and expecting her nails to stay nice.", "Yes, I would agree with you on that except...\n\nOP said they dropped the girl said, eat this, not that and then bounced.\n\nIf I have something going on after, I mention it.  So would you I bet.\n\n\"Oh. Btw, we're doin this that and the other after I pick her up, so try and keep it clean\"\n\nEven so, I have some plans like that, forget to mention it to my sister and all that fun happens, I go,\n\n\"Oops! I was gonna do such and such with her...but I forgot to mention it, so, my bad\"\n\nNot, freaking out on her like she abused her or something \n\nStill think the sister must have something going on to stress her out like this. \n\nI mean, I'd be all \"Awww,.looks like you had so much fun! Thanks Auntie so and so. Great job!\"\n\nNo matter what though, OP is NTA here.  \n\nBut that's just me.", "I worked on a show years ago where we used glitter in some of the illusion effects. Cast and crew renamed it \"Sparkle Herpes\" cause that sh!t gets everywhere and you're never getting rid!! \ud83e\udd23 (Seriously, my show suitcase still throws orange sparkle herpes at me over a decade later!\ud83e\udd26)"]}
