A parent's death is always going to be traumatic, but my older sister (25f) took it particularly hard. She was always really close with our mom so I understand that it would be more difficult for her to process.\n\nPretty soon after my mom's passing, around seven months, my dad told us he was dating his best friend, Thomas. Thomas has been friends with my dad since they were in college. For all of our lives, we called Thomas our 'bonus dad' because of how involved he was in pretty much everything. He came to our school plays awards ceremonies, our graduations, was there when we took prom photos. The list goes on. Nearly every single significant life moment I've had that my parents were there for, so was Thomas.\n\nIt was a little bit of a shock when he first told us, but I love my dad and Thomas. And maybe some would call me cheesy or say that I'm reading too much into things, but there's something in my dad's eyes now that just reads as peaceful. I think he deserves that. My sister didn't take this announcement as well as I did. She claimed that it was way too soon after my mom's passing for my dad to start dating.\n\nNow, this is where I may be the asshole. As I said, it's been three years since my mom passed and so it's been over two that my dad and Thomas have officially been together. I understand that grief is different for everyone and I still miss my mom every single day, but the bitterness my sister holds is unreasonable in my eyes. She came home over Christmas but she's never overly friendly with dad or Thomas, and it frustrates me. I called her out on it this year in private and told her she needed to stop making our dad feel guilty for moving on. She claimed she \"knew more than I did\" and that she was 99% sure that dad and Thomas had something going on while my mom was still alive.\n\nI told her I didn't really care if they did. That might sound fucked up, which is why I'm asking for judgement, but that's my dad's life, not mine. I said that there was no reason for us to be angry on my mom's behalf because she's gone. But our dad and Thomas are still here and she's wasting years with them worried about what I'm sure was a very nuanced situation. She hasn't spoken to me since Christmas.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: Please pay closer attention to gender indicators in my post.

Nope. You get to fondle and join in on your dad's ability to use women to get what he wants out of life, and your sister gets to acknowledge that her mother was used like a tool and cheated on throughout her marriage.\n\nYou're minus any proof mom went into the marriage with full understanding and acceptance of the situation.

Everything you write is either or, all or nothing.", "Thank you! I wasn't even acknowledging the alleged affair, because honestly it's not any of our business, and even the OP themselves don't know for sure.", "I\u2019ll be honest, this reads as polyamory to me. So there\u2019s the question of if it\u2019s an affair at all. Especially if OP\u2019s mom never said anything contrary to that.", "Can\u2019t you read? I didn\u2019t assume it. The comment before said that maybe the mum didn\u2019t know and I said even IF. Man why do i have to summarize my comment when it\u2019s literally there", "You didn't come here to hear YTA that's for sure. You came for validation and how much you 'care' for your sister is quite evident from your post. You don't have to scream that you care for her. You have to treat her with basic respect. Her relationship with her and your father is none of your business. Stop lying that you're doing it for your sister. You're doing this because you don't want your personal life inconvenienced which is why even the potentiality of your father's cheating on your mother is so acceptable to you, you won't even be bothered by the betrayal. Spare us your declarations of love for people whose feelings you have no empathy and respect for. When your child chooses their mother's affair partner over you, you can choose to call it 'love.' For the rest of humanity, this is disrespect and betrayal. Massive YTA.", "YTA. I HOPE YOU NEVER GET CHEATED ON.", "knowing if your father cheated is actually important means he isnt the man he portrays to be and nor is thomas they lack morals and self respect or care for people they hurt why would that not matter yta your sister is not weird or wrong for anything"]}
