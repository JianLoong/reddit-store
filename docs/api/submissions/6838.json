{"id": 6838, "submission_id": "106spv4", "title": "AITA for possibly excusing my dad's affair and telling my sister to move on?", "selftext": "My (19m) mom passed away three years ago. A parent's death is always going to be traumatic, but my older sister (25f) took it particularly hard. She was always really close with our mom so I understand that it would be more difficult for her to process.\n\nPretty soon after my mom's passing, around seven months, my dad told us he was dating his best friend, Thomas. Thomas has been friends with my dad since they were in college. For all of our lives, we called Thomas our 'bonus dad' because of how involved he was in pretty much everything. He came to our school plays awards ceremonies, our graduations, was there when we took prom photos. The list goes on. Nearly every single significant life moment I've had that my parents were there for, so was Thomas.\n\nIt was a little bit of a shock when he first told us, but I love my dad and Thomas. And maybe some would call me cheesy or say that I'm reading too much into things, but there's something in my dad's eyes now that just reads as peaceful. I think he deserves that. My sister didn't take this announcement as well as I did. She claimed that it was way too soon after my mom's passing for my dad to start dating.\n\nNow, this is where I may be the asshole. As I said, it's been three years since my mom passed and so it's been over two that my dad and Thomas have officially been together. I understand that grief is different for everyone and I still miss my mom every single day, but the bitterness my sister holds is unreasonable in my eyes. She came home over Christmas but she's never overly friendly with dad or Thomas, and it frustrates me. I called her out on it this year in private and told her she needed to stop making our dad feel guilty for moving on. She claimed she \"knew more than I did\" and that she was 99% sure that dad and Thomas had something going on while my mom was still alive.\n\nI told her I didn't really care if they did. That might sound fucked up, which is why I'm asking for judgement, but that's my dad's life, not mine. I said that there was no reason for us to be angry on my mom's behalf because she's gone. But our dad and Thomas are still here and she's wasting years with them worried about what I'm sure was a very nuanced situation. She hasn't spoken to me since Christmas.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: There seems to be a pervasive misconception that I told my sister to move on. I never did that. I don't think anyone ever 'moves on' from a parent or spouses death in the sense that it just leaves their mind. I told her she needs to stop guilting our dad over choosing a new romantic partner. The title - unable to be edited - was me attempting to be concise / get across the point that I was asking her to let go of the animosity she harbors towards him, not asking her to move on from our mom. The comments insinuating I've forgotten about my mom or don't care about her anymore are a leap and extremely off putting to say to a stranger...", "created_utc": 1673208243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106spv4/aita_for_possibly_excusing_my_dads_affair_and/", "score": 1849, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nope.

There is no indication in OP's post that the sister has an issue with her father dating a man, the indication is that the sister is upset that there could've been an affair that betrayed her mother's trust. You say there's nothing showing the mother was okay with it, but there also isn't anything stating she *was* okay with it. I have friends who my daughter refers to as \"bonus moms\" or \"aunts\" because they've been there for her since birth, and I'm not sleeping with any of them.

I never did that. \"\n\nThat is because it clearly states in your title that you did say that but I am sure others have already pointed that out.  As for the question being asked yes YTA.", "YTA  If she's right and they were dating before your mom died your sister has every right to be pissed.  I'd have gone NC over that.  You say no one truly moves on but you seemed to move on pretty fast considering you told your sister she's gone.  I'm thankful I don't have a dad or a sister.", ">about what I'm sure was a very nuanced situation\n\n**There is no nuance here. Dad was cheating, or dad was not cheating.**\n\nAnything he did after your mums death is his business, anything before that was also your mums, sisters and your business.\n\nJust something to ponder though...children that excuse (or willfully refuse to hear in your case), are more likely to become cheaters themselves. Is that the sort of partner you want to grow up to be?", "Sounds like Dad might be an AH for not dealing with whatever is causing your sister this much distress. \n\nIf she believes something happened- he should address this not let you be the one who stands up for him.", "YTA. She's not only grieving her mother but struggling with the fact that her father betrayed her mother. It's fine if you aren't mad at him, but telling her to simply get over it is an AH move. You don't get to tell her how to feel.", "YTA, you also sound kind of dismissive of your sibling. You kind of suck.", "YTA. Seriously, leave it the hell alone, OP. If she's being polite and not overtly rude, you have nothing to be whinging about. Grow up.", "YTA       \nIf there was an affair going on, then that was unforgivable. You had a chance to find out more facts from your sister but didn't take it, and instead chose to blame her.", "How sad that sister has a robot for a brother. \n\nTime for you, young man, to ask the Wizard for a heart \u2014 and a side of empathy & compassion. Perhaps, your cold, clinical analysis is due to unprocessed grief? Figure it out.\n\nYTA", "Yikes, so you're one of those that don't care because it didn't happened to you, YTA and I hope a cheater is on your future.", "This comment sums up the conflicts going on here best. Definitely a NAH from me", "For what we know, it could have been a poly marriage, or he dated Thomas with his wife knowledge and consent. It is just as wild guess and them having an affair.", "Technically he didn\u2019t tell her to move on with her grief he said to stop guilting their dad over finding another partner", "He didn't. He told his sister to stop being mean to dad because dad has moved on.", "But he didn't say that, so your lack of reading comprehension has really messed up the judgement bot on this one", "Everyone grieves differently, it\u2019s true but bitterness to the surviving parent is not healthy. Neither is speculation.", "A relationship built on a husband's lies to his wife is a sham.", "I'd want to know if the mother I loved had been cheated on. Period.  I don't care if she died yesterday or 40 years ago.", "I\u2019m going to be blunt, because maybe it will wake you up. It\u2019s entirely possible that your sister caught, or heard, your dad and Thomas having \u201cspecial wrestling time\u201d at some point in her life, possibly young. \n\nEven if it was nothing that direct, knowing that your family dynamic was a lie can be traumatic in and of itself. You. Are. Not. In. Charge. Of. Her. Trauma!\n\nYTA for dictating how she is permitted to feel and behave. When you chose to remain willfully ignorant, you gave up your right to even discuss the issue.", "I feel the sister is more upset because she knows they were together even while her mom was alive", "It didn\u2019t read so much as a timeframe for her father\u2019s grief, but anger that she believed he had cheated on their mother, which would be traumatic.", "\ud83d\udcaf", "A lot of people think one year is still wayy too soon especially in long term relationships", "NTA", "Wait what?!? That is a looooooot of interpretation", "You absolutely are. You have no right to dictate how your sister should or shouldn't feel. Leave it alone. You screwed up by being an insensitive jerk. Accept it and move on.", "Welcome to AITA, where the mere thought of a discreet DNA test would get you smited to death, but someone can just make accusations and not elaborate, and it's just taken as truth by commenters.", "I hate when people make assumptions like this. They already made a decision about a situation so anything that goes against that must be wrong. You don\u2019t know that an affair did or didn\u2019t take place. Your speaking on a situation you have no information on as thought every situation is the same", "Oh please, so all of a sudden the two come out at the same time. And now their a couple. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI think \ud83e\udd14 the father was living a double life. Maybe the mother knew about it and loved her husband so much she wanted him to happy. Maybe the two men were really good at fooling everyone.", "Yeah. Reading this post actually made me smile a little because my husband and I have a friend that I\u2019d consider a bit of a third wheel in our relationship; but in a good way. He\u2019s my ex (from over a decade ago) and one of my husbands best friends (I introduced them after my husband and I started dating). He\u2019s never dated seriously after we broke up and is a perpetual bachelor. When we have kids I expect him to play a huge part in their lives, and we often joke that if my husband or I passed away, the remaining two would raise the kids and grow old together. I know he loves both my husband and I dearly. I couldn\u2019t be happier if I passed away and that\u2019s what actually happened.", "What if some of the commenters here are too and that's why they're defending the sister.", "Yea no problem. I find how people react to certain comments more interesting than the posts most of the time so I usually rather comment about that.", "Denial is a river in Egypt", "That was my first thought when OP listed the number of events the boyfriend attended. That level of family inclusion is so atypical that I\u2019d be shocked if mom wasn\u2019t in some way accepting of a not-just-friends dynamic, though maybe I\u2019m just not familiar with cultures where that would be normal", "This. I remember one time when I was around 16 I found some explicit photos of a woman on the computer. My imagination went wild. I was convinced my dad was cheating and dramatically told my mom.\n\nI started crying. \n\nMom started crying... from laughter. \n\n\nAnd thats how I learned about swinging\u2026", "No joke! If one of my kids was totally happy with their dad moving on 7 months after I died, let alone with the super obvious affair partner, I'd be rolling in my grave. Like dude couldnt even wait a year after the mother of his children died. No wonder the daughter is cold!", "You may not see it as your business now but this would change her relationship with your father. Just because someone is dead doesn't mean you stop caring about them. And when an action is taken against them you can still get angry on their behalf.", "So his sister, who refuses to say how she knows it was an affair, should be blindly believed", "Oh nooo, you went against their narrative and even though you only shared your own story, you got to get downvoted now. Good job, reddit", "Might not have been an affair, mom could have been involved in the relationship too. Sounds like Thomas was around enough for that to be true.", "Except the sister isn't butting in.", "Being gay was not excepted in a lot a places, it's not uncommon for older couples to only come out later in life now it's more generally excepted. Mother probably always knew, yes it's a speculation just like 95% of this comment section, also being mad her father found love and comfort and didn't grieve enough is a very emotional response that's clearly not healthy and should not be held on to...", "I hope he does."]}
