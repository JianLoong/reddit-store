{"id": 6838, "submission_id": "106spv4", "title": "AITA for possibly excusing my dad's affair and telling my sister to move on?", "selftext": "My (19m) mom passed away three years ago. A parent's death is always going to be traumatic, but my older sister (25f) took it particularly hard. She was always really close with our mom so I understand that it would be more difficult for her to process.\n\nPretty soon after my mom's passing, around seven months, my dad told us he was dating his best friend, Thomas. Thomas has been friends with my dad since they were in college. For all of our lives, we called Thomas our 'bonus dad' because of how involved he was in pretty much everything. He came to our school plays awards ceremonies, our graduations, was there when we took prom photos. The list goes on. Nearly every single significant life moment I've had that my parents were there for, so was Thomas.\n\nIt was a little bit of a shock when he first told us, but I love my dad and Thomas. And maybe some would call me cheesy or say that I'm reading too much into things, but there's something in my dad's eyes now that just reads as peaceful. I think he deserves that. My sister didn't take this announcement as well as I did. She claimed that it was way too soon after my mom's passing for my dad to start dating.\n\nNow, this is where I may be the asshole. As I said, it's been three years since my mom passed and so it's been over two that my dad and Thomas have officially been together. I understand that grief is different for everyone and I still miss my mom every single day, but the bitterness my sister holds is unreasonable in my eyes. She came home over Christmas but she's never overly friendly with dad or Thomas, and it frustrates me. I called her out on it this year in private and told her she needed to stop making our dad feel guilty for moving on. She claimed she \"knew more than I did\" and that she was 99% sure that dad and Thomas had something going on while my mom was still alive.\n\nI told her I didn't really care if they did. That might sound fucked up, which is why I'm asking for judgement, but that's my dad's life, not mine. I said that there was no reason for us to be angry on my mom's behalf because she's gone. But our dad and Thomas are still here and she's wasting years with them worried about what I'm sure was a very nuanced situation. She hasn't spoken to me since Christmas.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: There seems to be a pervasive misconception that I told my sister to move on. I never did that. I don't think anyone ever 'moves on' from a parent or spouses death in the sense that it just leaves their mind. I told her she needs to stop guilting our dad over choosing a new romantic partner. The title - unable to be edited - was me attempting to be concise / get across the point that I was asking her to let go of the animosity she harbors towards him, not asking her to move on from our mom. The comments insinuating I've forgotten about my mom or don't care about her anymore are a leap and extremely off putting to say to a stranger...", "created_utc": 1673208243, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106spv4/aita_for_possibly_excusing_my_dads_affair_and/", "score": 726, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nope.

If there really was an affair and she had any proof she wouldn\u2019t go \u201ctrust me bro\u201d.", "As OP should have done.  It's not her business and she is being very appropriate in maintaining that boundary.", "But doesn\u2019t the sister also want it both ways? She wants to be able to grieve for how ever long and feels the father moved on too quickly and didn\u2019t grieve long enough so ultimately she is just contradicting herself.\n\nAs far as the affair, I find it highly unlikely the sister knew this whole time and was \n\n1. Surprised when the father and best friend got together and took offense to it\n\n2. And is she really is as angry as OP says if she \u201csaw something as a child\u201d she would have said something by now.\n\nOP shouldn\u2019t force his sister to feel a certain way. And the sister shouldn\u2019t expect the fathers grieving to match hers and also shouldn\u2019t accuse of affair just because his grieving process didn\u2019t match hers and that\u2019s the only way she can make it make sense in her head. She has no solid proof because if she did, again, she would have said something to at least the brother by now.", "It is generally good advice but there can be exceptions. I got together with my new partner only a few months after my husband died suddenly. And my new partner is widowed too. We were faithful and never thought we would find someone so soon. But\u2026 no kids to worry about and we thoroughly check in with our respective therapists to make sure we are on the right track. I honestly don\u2019t know how I would have gotten through the tough times without my new partner. Thankfully all our loved ones including my in-laws have taken it very well.", "Nope, the bonus dad thing was fully embraced by both of my parents. There are photos of Thomas and I / Thomas and my sister in both of our baby books.\n\nNot sure why that's making people so angry. The possibility of that seems just as likely as an affair.", "She's uncomfortable? Big fucking deal. She can grow up like everyone else in life has to.", "This is my thought as well.", "Right and for all we know, mom could have known that dad and Thomas were a thing and just let it go for the sake of staying married for the medical insurance.", "The sister is 6 years older than OP, there may be things she was privy too when they were children that OP was too young to recognize.", "And ordering her to be happy for Dad will make her happier? If you're truly concerned about her well-being, there are a million other ways to approach the issue.", "You\u2019re still the asshole", "If she had proof she'd be 100% certain, just like scientists are 100% certain that evolution exists.", "If Thomas was as involved in the kids' lives as OP stated, it'd be hard for mom *not to know* about the relationship. I think all four of them need to sit down and have an open - but respectful - discussion to air the concerns, apologize where necessary, and learn to love each other now before it's too late.", "I totally agree. Dad probably came clean years ago and they decided to stay married. Even if that's not the case, Dad is happy. How is that a bad thing?", "I still doubt she has the whole story if she's still going home but being passive aggressive", "That\u2019s actually rarely how science works. You find evidence that supports your hypothesis, but and with enough evidence, you can have a pretty high degree of certainty, but very little is ever 100% certain.", "Like how flat earthers are 100% certain the earth's flat?", "Right, okay.. expressing how my family handled it is gaslighting? Good to know. Blocking this bullshit", "I know this is confusing but we're not actually talking about science, we're talking about whether OP's sister knows her dad was having an affair or not. And if she actually did know she wouldn't have said she was 99% sure because that's not how real people talk about things. There would have been no need to add a qualifying 1% of doubt if there was no doubt.", "Well no because they don't have any proof.", "Just shows that someone saying they're 100% certain of something requires absolutely 0 proof given things like religion and flat earth existing. Just because someone's 100% certain god exists doesn't make the claim accurate, and nor does it mean they have proof. 100% certainty is a personal level of conviction in your belief, not that it's proven.", "Yeah so the fact the sister was willing to leave 1% of doubt about the affair tells you quite a lot about the evidence she has."]}
