Telling the bride of the wedding you're the best man in to fuck off is a bit much. Perhaps she's a bit worried about what a bachelor party in Vegas will involve. Vegas has such a raunchy and rowdy reputation. You seem to not like your best friend's bride to be.\n\nThe bride should have left it alone. I think this doesn't bode well for the marriage.

I know that I have to make arrangements (like asking the neighbors to give the dog his meds at 2PM while I am at work) if my spouse is gonna be out of town for an extended time.  Also I always tell MY spouse what flight I'm taking (just in case god forbid there is a plane crash) and which hotel I'm staying at when I am at a conference/convention just in case she needs it for an emergency (or once again, if there is a shooting or something she's not in a situation where she doesn't know what hotel her fiancee is at).\n\nEVERYONE in this situation just needs to learn how to communicate better.\n\nHer: (for the 5th time) So what are you doing for the Bachelor party?\n\nYou: We probably wont have concrete plans until we are in Vegas, we are sort of playing it by ear.  But I'll send you an itenerary: we are catching United Airlines 6969 on 7/6 at 4:20PM, and catching the same flight back on 7/11, landing at 6:09PM.  Staying at the Bellagio on the strip.

But the more of your comments I read, the more I understand what she's dealing with, and why she's not willing to trust you or let this go. \n\nShe's not asking for a second-by-second itinerary, she wants a general outline of where her fianc\u00e9 is going to be while he's away, and what y'all are planning.

Then at least you would understand her motivation (e.g., does she just feel the need to know where he will be at all times, or is she concerns you are going to hire prostitutes) and could respond appropriately.", "Ehhh, I'd say YTA. You just need to tell the woman y'all aren't going to bang strippers. She just wants to hear someone tell her that her man isn't gonna fuck some stripper in Vegas. That's all she wants an itinerary for, she just wants to make sure her fiance isn't about to do something unfaithful and terrible. Instead of appeasing her, you've now caused tension between you two and you know the tension is also there between the two getting married now. You should've just played nice, because now there's hurt feelings before the wedding and that is never good.", "YTA. This isn't a bro trip- this guy is getting married and you accepted the role of best man. His job is to learn how to be married (or decide he doesn't want to be married) and your job is to support his marriage or his decision. If I'm you, that means asking him if he's getting premarital counseling. They need to figure out a productive way to problem solve- or figure out if they can't before it's too late. Right now she's hounding, he's going passive and you're stuck in the middle. Tell them both to get into counseling and send them a link to someone.", "YTA- why not just sit down and think about what you do want to do. And then write up a basic day by day itinerary of it.   And will you be expecting the groom to be to pay for his part of this trip? Because this could be part of why she is asking so they can budget towards it.\n\nAND you also need to open your mouth and ask him if there are things she has boundaries about.

She has priority in your friends life moving forward. Might as well get along, and respect his wife.", "YTA\n\nThis just sounds like a case of you just not liking her. I'm surprised your friend hasn't said anything to you about being so disrespectful to his fianc\u00e9e.\n\nSome people have boundaries about what their SO can get away with at a party.

I agree with you that it isn\u2019t your job to give her the itinerary of the bachelor party.  Once it is finalized the groom can tell her, if he chooses.  This has absolutely nothing to do with the wedding. And nothing wrong with politely pointing that out. She should butt out and worry about her own issues.   If there is something she is specifically concerned about - like strippers - she should make sure her fianc\u00e9 knows her expectations and he can pass them on to you.  But it could have been handled better.  Like maybe just saying \u201cLook when plans are finalized the groom will have them and you can check with him.

Everyone knows why you picked Vegas and based on your replies you sound like the type to encourage shitty behavior just because you don't like her.  Dollars to donuts you already know you're taking him to a strip club and paying to get him attention", "YTA. At least try to assuage her real concerns before calling her a control freak (she may be, doesn\u2019t matter). If you haven\u2019t been willing to talk through the subjects of strippers, prostitutes, and lap dances, then she has good reason to be worried. Either tell her you\u2019re not going to do those things or be realistic with Reddit about the problem lol.", "Honestly, YTA. And from your comments you seem like an AH in general. Telling someone to fuck off is going to make you an AH 95% of the time. Vegas has a bad reputation, so I get being a little concerned about it. And if you feel you can\u2019t share your plans with his partner, maybe you shouldn\u2019t be doing those activities.", "ESH. She's being controlling, but you not telling her makes it seem like you have something to hide which is fueling her insecurities. It wouldn't be so much effort to throw her a bone and just tell her.", "YTA. You telling her to \u201cfuck off\u201d means you already leave a lack of respect for her and from your comments it seems as if you don\u2019t like her.

I had a friend with a fianc\u00e9e just like this.
