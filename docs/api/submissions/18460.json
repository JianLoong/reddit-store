It was your medication and she stole it, plain and simple. \n\nHowever, *please* do not do this thinking that it will make her get help. It won\u2019t.

Not yours. You\u2019re in the clear no matter what. I just don\u2019t want you thinking that this will get her help because you will be really disappointed. The way our society handles drug addiction is fuckin stupid and there\u2019s almost nothing you can do that will help her (unless you feel like petitioning your politicians for increased mental health funding but that still won\u2019t help her immediately). \n\nAlso I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t need to take any oxy to deal with the pain after surgery - that\u2019s how the road to addiction started for literally 90% of my clients with drug issues.
