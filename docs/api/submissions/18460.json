This situation was presented to you as your choice, but it isn't. If a person is suspected of committing a crime, it's up to the legal system to figure out whether there's evidence of that. Not you. You can't just choose whether or not to \"press charges\" in a criminal case. Either there's enough evidence of a crime to move forward with charges, or not.

You're shocking her by doing so and her sentence may be to have a drug use evaluation and go through treatment if it's a first-time offense. \n\nWhether she sits in prison for a long time depends on the judge and her criminal record. That's about her, not about you.", "NTA.\nYou did the right thing. She obviously has a problem and would most likely steal from someone else. Hopefully you helped prevent that.\n\nI was a caregiver for many years and occasionally you'd encounter a junkie that stole pills from clients.

Bye bye fake friend/drugaddict/thief. Hopefully it will be a lesson learned if not people can look at her record and see she is untrustworthy. That would be on them.", "NTA. Oxy is an opioid. I\u2019m surprised they gave it to you but that\u2019s irrelevant, I\u2019m just adamant about not getting near the stuff. \n\nThey either already have a problem like you suspect, are at the beginning of one, or are selling it. In any case, they need consequences now before they possibly get into a situation with more dire, irreversible consequences (i.e. OD)", "NTA\n\nas an aside, this is a great example of why anyone who has committed a crime or is being suspected of committing a crime should ALWAYS keep their mouth shut until they are under arrest and have consulted with a lawyer. this girl could have *easily* gotten away with this if she just denied it and kept her mouth shut. it might have caused uncomfortable situations at work, maybe the wife would have said something to management and she would have gotten fired, but without her admitting to the theft and returning the pills, there would be no way for the police to charge her with anything.", "More likely, she\u2019s hiding them in an OTC bottle so she can hide her own addiction.", "NTA. Maybe it might encourage her to get help.", "NTA Never an asshole for reporting and charging a thief.", "Did she genuinely only have 2-3 pills? If so, that is *incredibly* surprising. If one of my clients with addictions issues had taken those pills, they would\u2019ve had at least 8-10 in two days. \n\nAnyway, NTA for pressing charges if you want. It was your medication and she stole it, plain and simple. \n\nHowever, *please* do not do this thinking that it will make her get help. It won\u2019t. It\u2019ll probably result in a more severe relapse (I\u2019m a psychologist and I\u2019m speaking from clinical experience - every single time my clients had charges pressed, they got worse not better). \n\nEither way, you still wouldn\u2019t be the asshole - if she gets in trouble and her issues get worse, that will be a direct result of *her* choices. Not yours. You\u2019re in the clear no matter what. I just don\u2019t want you thinking that this will get her help because you will be really disappointed. The way our society handles drug addiction is fuckin stupid and there\u2019s almost nothing you can do that will help her (unless you feel like petitioning your politicians for increased mental health funding but that still won\u2019t help her immediately). \n\nAlso I\u2019m glad you didn\u2019t need to take any oxy to deal with the pain after surgery - that\u2019s how the road to addiction started for literally 90% of my clients with drug issues. So I\u2019m really glad you avoided that potential path.", "NTA and check to see if anything else is missing.
