Your daughter isn\u2019t going to wear those and your SIL is wasting her money and you\u2019re stopping her from doing so.\n\nThere are other things she could buy APART FROM CLOTHES. EG - there are so many kids\u2019 books on brilliant women from history - she could get some of those?", "NTA. We shouldn\u2019t smother kids with gender roles against their will, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. Your daughter wants to wear girly clothes and you\u2019re letting her. It sounds like you told your SIL the situation and she didn\u2019t listen.", " Your SIL is reinforcing genders stereotypes. \n\nAsk her why she feels it\u2019s so repugnant to be a girl and why the only acceptable gender identity is male? \n\nHaving a dislike of female things isn\u2019t progressive it\u2019s prejudice.

She thinks women are inherently inferior to men so they must compensate by being more masculine. \n\nShe won\u2019t see it this way though, cognitive dissonance is crazy.", "NTA.  If daughter doesn't want to wear the clothes, OP is essentially just a dumping ground here.  Sounds like it is time for SiL to either start asking first or just take the stuff to donate herself and cut out the middle person. \n\nTo be clear this situation, at least as presented, isn't a case of forcing gendered, everyday clothing on a child.  The child expressed expressed a preference, and OP respected that.  The point of conflict is sister using OP as a dumping ground and that isn't cool.", "It's not about stereotyoes : your SIL intentionally gave your daughter a gift knowing she wouldn't like it.  \nWhy do that to a child on her birthday ?\n\nIf she wants to fight against gender stereotypes, she should make it her personal battle or join an association.

I'd give them back to her every single time, as she clearly doesn't care what you daughter actually wants. Do you buy gifts for SIL for her bday or Christmas? Maybe buy her some men's work boots or coveralls or a lovely toolbox.

Sounds like the child knows what she prefers.  It would be a shame to waste clothes if the child won't wear them.  SIL could return them, or you could donate them since kids grow out of clothes fast enough at this age.", "Your daughter\u2014even if she\u2019s four\u2014clearly doesn\u2019t want the clothes. You talked to your sister in law about these clothes. I don\u2019t know why she thinks continuing to give her niece clothes meant for boys is acceptable when she clearly knows this is not okay. I\u2019m going to go with NTA, with a question. Couldn\u2019t you at least donate the unwanted clothes?", "NTA. What isn't ok if forcing gender stereotypes onto someone. But in this case you're giving your kid what she wants and your sister is the one forcing her views on someone.", "NTA - She thinks she is being progressive but shoving her agenda down people's throats in a misplaced opportunity just isn't it.

I would have NEVER EVER wore clothes made for boys when I was a child, I don\u2019t see why your SIL thinks that\u2019s anywhere near a good idea to give her those clothes. Gender Norms really don\u2019t apply here because your daughter LIKES girly clothes. Again, it would be a different thing if she was a tom-boy or only interested in boy things, but she\u2019s clearly not.

It's doubly rude to double down on doing so after having been told a particular type of present isn't welcome. My mom told me when I was a kid that if I only ever do the opposite of what others do, I'm still letting them decide for me because I'm still basing my decision on theirs.

When my daughter was 4yo she didn't like wearing sundresses my parents bought her but preferred tshirts and leggings.

That it\u2019s good and should be encouraged for people to be proud to wear pink and girly things if that\u2019s what they want to wear. \n\nPushing boy clothes on a kid who clearly wants to wear more feminine things is basically saying that pink and feminine clothes are less acceptable. That they\u2019re not as good as boy clothes, and that to be a strong girl and/or strong woman in the future a person has to reject pink and femme styles. \n\nThat\u2019s very toxic, and it\u2019s not where the conversation on gender and gender expression is going. \n\nMe personally - I *still* don\u2019t wear pink, because it makes me feel a bit dysphoric.
