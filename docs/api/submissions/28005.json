Your daughter isn\u2019t going to wear those and your SIL is wasting her money and you\u2019re stopping her from doing so.\n\nThere are other things she could buy APART FROM CLOTHES. EG - there are so many kids\u2019 books on brilliant women from history - she could get some of those?", "NTA. We shouldn\u2019t smother kids with gender roles against their will, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s happening here. Your daughter wants to wear girly clothes and you\u2019re letting her. It sounds like you told your SIL the situation and she didn\u2019t listen.", " Your SIL is reinforcing genders stereotypes. \n\nAsk her why she feels it\u2019s so repugnant to be a girl and why the only acceptable gender identity is male? \n\nHaving a dislike of female things isn\u2019t progressive it\u2019s prejudice. Your sister in law has internalized misogyny. She thinks women are inherently inferior to men so they must compensate by being more masculine. \n\nShe won\u2019t see it this way though, cognitive dissonance is crazy.", "NTA.  If daughter doesn't want to wear the clothes, OP is essentially just a dumping ground here.  Sounds like it is time for SiL to either start asking first or just take the stuff to donate herself and cut out the middle person. \n\nTo be clear this situation, at least as presented, isn't a case of forcing gendered, everyday clothing on a child.  The child expressed expressed a preference, and OP respected that.  The point of conflict is sister using OP as a dumping ground and that isn't cool.", "It's not about stereotyoes : your SIL intentionally gave your daughter a gift knowing she wouldn't like it.  \nWhy do that to a child on her birthday ?\n\nIf she wants to fight against gender stereotypes, she should make it her personal battle or join an association. Your daughter's birthday party isn't the place for that, and your child isn't her guinea pig.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Gifts should be targeted to the recipient, not to the giver's belief.\n\nThat said, your daughter is now getting old enough for you to work with her on graciously accepting gifts we don't like without making faces etc.", "**NTA** \\- This is about what your daughter wants, not about whether or not you are staying with gender stereotypes.  Your SIL is the asshole for trying to push *her* worldview onto *your* child.", "NTA. This is not about gender stereotypes, this is about your SIL intentionally buying gifts she knows your daughter won\u2019t like to make a point.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely ok for your daughter to be a \u2018stereotypical\u2019 girly girl. You\u2019re not forcing anything in her, just letting her be herself and that\u2019s how it should be.", "NTA. I'd give them back to her every single time, as she clearly doesn't care what you daughter actually wants. Do you buy gifts for SIL for her bday or Christmas? Maybe buy her some men's work boots or coveralls or a lovely toolbox. Or a razor and some (men's) shaving cream.", "NTA.\n\nThis isn't about \"gender stereotypes\", this is about your kid having a clothing preference, which your SIL is disrespecting based on her own feelings about gender and clothing.", "NTA.  Sounds like the child knows what she prefers.  It would be a shame to waste clothes if the child won't wear them.  SIL could return them, or you could donate them since kids grow out of clothes fast enough at this age.", "Your daughter\u2014even if she\u2019s four\u2014clearly doesn\u2019t want the clothes. You talked to your sister in law about these clothes. I don\u2019t know why she thinks continuing to give her niece clothes meant for boys is acceptable when she clearly knows this is not okay. I\u2019m going to go with NTA, with a question. Couldn\u2019t you at least donate the unwanted clothes?", "NTA. What isn't ok if forcing gender stereotypes onto someone. But in this case you're giving your kid what she wants and your sister is the one forcing her views on someone.", "NTA - She thinks she is being progressive but shoving her agenda down people's throats in a misplaced opportunity just isn't it. She sounds like one of those people who need to make everything about themselves, even a kid's birthday.", "Nta. She\u2019s pushing her ideas of what your daughter should like. A gift should be given that you think the person would want (or need if they ask for that). I\u2019m not going out buying my oldest daughter dresses knowing she hates them and I\u2019m not buying my youngest girl \u201cboy clothes\u201d bc she\u2019s a sparkly princess.", "NTA- That\u2019s absolutely ridiculous. Your daughter is a person. She has a consciousness. She knows what she likes. If in the future she expresses that she\u2019s not interested in the more girly things, then that\u2019s a different story, but for now- they need to let her be the way she is, which is girly. I would have NEVER EVER wore clothes made for boys when I was a child, I don\u2019t see why your SIL thinks that\u2019s anywhere near a good idea to give her those clothes. Gender Norms really don\u2019t apply here because your daughter LIKES girly clothes. Again, it would be a different thing if she was a tom-boy or only interested in boy things, but she\u2019s clearly not. Tell your SIL that you won\u2019t be accepting gifts from her anymore if they\u2019re not the things your daughter would enjoy.", "NTA. It's rude to give presents you know the recipient won't like. It's doubly rude to double down on doing so after having been told a particular type of present isn't welcome. My mom told me when I was a kid that if I only ever do the opposite of what others do, I'm still letting them decide for me because I'm still basing my decision on theirs. In a society with so much pressure to behave a certain way, the most radical act is to do what *you* like, regardless of if it goes along with social norms or not.", "NTA if your daughter has liked \u201cgirly\u201d things after given the freedom to explore what she likes then no you aren\u2019t the AHole. She likes what she likes it\u2019s your SIL trying to push things she doesn\u2019t like on her that\u2019s wrong \nStick to your guns, if she\u2019s gonna kick up a fuss about you giving presents back just keep them to re gift to someone else or put it up for sale somewhere and use the money to take your daughter to the shops to get something she would actually want \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Nta, but to keep the peace you can regift them to a friends kid that wasn't at the party, try to go to the store and return it or donate them. Then to be a bit spiteful you can do the same to her on her b'day or a y event you would give her gifts.", "NTA good for standing up for your daughter. If she does it again don't give her the validation she wants. At 4 things don't stick long so I'd tell your daughter anytime a gift is incoming that if Auntie insane gives her a boy toy or clothes you'll donate it to some little boy who needs it. And Santa will be watching so you'll be put on the extra nice list. And then add a thank you note from Santa and give her a extra special gift.", "NTA. A 4yo would have their preferences by now. When my daughter was 4yo she didn't like wearing sundresses my parents bought her but preferred tshirts and leggings. My parents were very understanding why their only granddaughter didn't wear those dresses because they knew she was the type to be very firm in her preferrences. They just switched to buying tshirts and leggings.", "Nta I\u2019ve been a tomboy all my life and my daughter is a super girly girl. I indulge all her interests and don\u2019t try to impose my preferences.", "NTA, I discovered black at about age 7 and wouldn't wear anything else, especially girly stuff. One of my aunts was convinced I should act more like a young lady and would buy me pink dresses. They went straight to the charity shop. \n\nYou can't force a child to be something they aren't, your daughter has a preference and no matter how much your SIL wants to crusade against stereotypes, your daughter's birthday is neither the time or place.", "NTA", "NTA. You're not forcing stuff on your kid, but she's going \"I like this stuff not this stuff\", so you're asking for stuff she'll wear/use/whatever.\n\nSometimes stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason,  and your daughter being a girly girl is fine if that's what she wants.", "NTA.\n\nEmma is clearly old enough to decide what she feels comfortable in. She doesn't want boy clothes. SIL needs to think about what her niece is actually interested in versus her own opinions on gender stereotypes. I'm not saying SIL has to go buy princess dresses, but for her to go and buy boy clothes for a child who is very much a girly girl isn't fair to the kid.", "NTA, remove gender from the argument and your sister actively bought your daughter something she didn\u2019t like because she thought she knew better than you. If you give your child the choice on what she wants to wear and she still chooses \u201cgirl\u201d clothes then you aren\u2019t enforcing anything.\nI don\u2019t care for the whole \u201cpink for girls/blue for boys\u201d thing I think kids should just be able to like what they like and if your daughter likes pink then she should be allowed to wear pink.", "NTA \nYour daughter is allowed to be girly without being accused of conforming to gender stereotypes. Your sister is toxic.", "NTA - but you don't need to give the clothes back to SIL. That's a bit odd. Just return them and teach your daughter to say thanks for any presents even if she doesn't like them.

Emma will continue to receive many gifts that are not to her taste. She still has to learn to smile and say thank you. You need to model that behavior.\n\nYou could have easily given the clothes away or matched them with something girly for a cute unisex look. I saw a little girl wearing a navy sweatshirt with dinosaurs, clearly meant for boys, paired with an orange tutu and navy leggings. It was adorable.", "ESH.
