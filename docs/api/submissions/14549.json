We rented a new and more spacious apartment together, we split rent and most of the expenses (according to our wages). We both work, I have a full time job and she works part time. I'll answer more questions if needed.\n\nI am a terrible cook, I don't like it at all and every time I try to cook something is tastes awful, so my girlfriend cooks most of our meals. Tbh also I don't do many of the household chores, it's not that I want my girlfriend to do everything on her own, but I was living with my mom before moving out and she used to do everything. I do other stuff and I do chores when asked. This is a small issue between us, but not as big.\n\nYesterday I came back from work (around 8) and my girlfriend was cooking for us, we had dinner and then she was washing the dishes. We were chatting while she cleaned, then I went to hug her while she was putting everything on place (the seasonings and that kind of stuff), by this time it was like an hour later. I was trying to hug her and kiss her but she was like \"leave me alone a sec\" and moving away. She wasn't angry, she was just busy. \n\nThen I let her go and tell her something like \"why are you so cold\" in a whiny voice, I was trying to be funny. She then snapped \"why are you so high maintenance?\"\n\nI was kinda shock by her tone, I thought she was joking and I said \"you're for real?\" And she said \"yeah, I love you but you're high maintenance, sometimes I can't with you\"\n\nThen I got upset and I told her I'll leave her alone and left to our bedroom. Around maybe 15 minutes later she comes in and was trying to talk to me, but I was kinda ignoring her and giving her short answers because I didn't wanted to talk to her. She asked me what was going on and I told her that we were joking around until she started saying stuff that hurt. She then went off me, she told me I never help or if I do she has to tell me what to do, she says she feels like she's my mom sometimes. We argued and now we're on a tight spot.", "created_utc": 1681236581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12is7my/aita_for_being_upset_after_my_girlfriend_called/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's also a great recipe that serves as a springboard for many other things, it may take a few times to get the hang of it but it's a great beginning.

I'll answer more questions if needed.\n\nI am a terrible cook, I don't like it at all and every time I try to cook something is tastes awful, so my girlfriend cooks most of our meals. Tbh also I don't do many of the household chores, it's not that I want my girlfriend to do everything on her own, but I was living with my mom before moving out and she used to do everything. I do other stuff and I do chores when asked. This is a small issue between us, but not as big.\n\nYesterday I came back from work (around 8) and my girlfriend was cooking for us, we had dinner and then she was washing the dishes. We were chatting while she cleaned, then I went to hug her while she was putting everything on place (the seasonings and that kind of stuff), by this time it was like an hour later. I was trying to hug her and kiss her but she was like \"leave me alone a sec\" and moving away. She wasn't angry, she was just busy. \n\nThen I let her go and tell her something like \"why are you so cold\" in a whiny voice, I was trying to be funny. She then snapped \"why are you so high maintenance?\"\n\nI was kinda shock by her tone, I thought she was joking and I said \"you're for real?\" And she said \"yeah, I love you but you're high maintenance, sometimes I can't with you\"\n\nThen I got upset and I told her I'll leave her alone and left to oir bedroom. Around maybe 15 minutes later she comes in and was trying to talk to me, but I was kinda ignoring her and giving her short answers because I didn't wanted to talk to her. She asked me what was going on and I told her that we were joking around until she started saying stuff that hurt. She then went off me, she told me I never help or if I do she has to tell me what to do, she says she feels like she's my mom sometimes. We argued and now we're on a tight spot.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So, I am going to give you a nurse example. \n\nIf there were 2 nurses on duty, and while you were rushing to answer patients call buttons you look over and notice your colleague just sitting there watching you. Then when you come back and are charting, they start trying to chat with you and want to show you this funny thing on their phone that they just watched while you covered all the patients. \n\nYou would probably be pretty annoyed.\n\nImagine if in response to your annoyance, they got upset and told you that had you told them that you needed help and what you wanted them to do, they would have done it. \n\nSounds kinda annoying doesn\u2019t it", "So you just sat and watched her clean?  That makes me absolutely incredulous. Life tip OP, if you want people to like you, never just sit around and watch them while they\u2019re working and you\u2019re just sitting there.

I had to teach him to cook, do dishes, do laundry, clean up, etc. My final straw was coming back from a 2 week vacation to bugs all over the apartment from the filth. It was so bad that I didn't even make it to my door that the building manager came running to me to deal with the stink coming from the apartment. Without me there to mommy this guy, he was clueless.
