We rented a new and more spacious apartment together, we split rent and most of the expenses (according to our wages). We both work, I have a full time job and she works part time. I'll answer more questions if needed.\n\nI am a terrible cook, I don't like it at all and every time I try to cook something is tastes awful, so my girlfriend cooks most of our meals. Tbh also I don't do many of the household chores, it's not that I want my girlfriend to do everything on her own, but I was living with my mom before moving out and she used to do everything. I do other stuff and I do chores when asked. This is a small issue between us, but not as big.\n\nYesterday I came back from work (around 8) and my girlfriend was cooking for us, we had dinner and then she was washing the dishes. We were chatting while she cleaned, then I went to hug her while she was putting everything on place (the seasonings and that kind of stuff), by this time it was like an hour later. I was trying to hug her and kiss her but she was like \"leave me alone a sec\" and moving away. She wasn't angry, she was just busy. \n\nThen I let her go and tell her something like \"why are you so cold\" in a whiny voice, I was trying to be funny. She then snapped \"why are you so high maintenance?\"\n\nI was kinda shock by her tone, I thought she was joking and I said \"you're for real?\" And she said \"yeah, I love you but you're high maintenance, sometimes I can't with you\"\n\nThen I got upset and I told her I'll leave her alone and left to our bedroom. Around maybe 15 minutes later she comes in and was trying to talk to me, but I was kinda ignoring her and giving her short answers because I didn't wanted to talk to her. She asked me what was going on and I told her that we were joking around until she started saying stuff that hurt. She then went off me, she told me I never help or if I do she has to tell me what to do, she says she feels like she's my mom sometimes. We argued and now we're on a tight spot.\n\n\nEdit: I get it, I suck. Thanks for the comments, I'll learn how to do the chores and I've already apologized to my girlfriend", "created_utc": 1681236581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12is7my/aita_for_being_upset_after_my_girlfriend_called/", "score": 1812, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A homemade sauce is *very simple* to make but very tasty nonetheless.

Boil pasta, serve it over pasta, and voila - you'll impress her by showing you *can* cook. It's also a great recipe that serves as a springboard for many other things, it may take a few times to get the hang of it but it's a great beginning.

I'll answer more questions if needed.\n\nI am a terrible cook, I don't like it at all and every time I try to cook something is tastes awful, so my girlfriend cooks most of our meals. Tbh also I don't do many of the household chores, it's not that I want my girlfriend to do everything on her own, but I was living with my mom before moving out and she used to do everything. I do other stuff and I do chores when asked. This is a small issue between us, but not as big.\n\nYesterday I came back from work (around 8) and my girlfriend was cooking for us, we had dinner and then she was washing the dishes. We were chatting while she cleaned, then I went to hug her while she was putting everything on place (the seasonings and that kind of stuff), by this time it was like an hour later. I was trying to hug her and kiss her but she was like \"leave me alone a sec\" and moving away. She wasn't angry, she was just busy. \n\nThen I let her go and tell her something like \"why are you so cold\" in a whiny voice, I was trying to be funny. She then snapped \"why are you so high maintenance?\"\n\nI was kinda shock by her tone, I thought she was joking and I said \"you're for real?\" And she said \"yeah, I love you but you're high maintenance, sometimes I can't with you\"\n\nThen I got upset and I told her I'll leave her alone and left to oir bedroom. Around maybe 15 minutes later she comes in and was trying to talk to me, but I was kinda ignoring her and giving her short answers because I didn't wanted to talk to her. She asked me what was going on and I told her that we were joking around until she started saying stuff that hurt. She then went off me, she told me I never help or if I do she has to tell me what to do, she says she feels like she's my mom sometimes. We argued and now we're on a tight spot.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's an important skill to have even if you don't use it much and learning to do it while depressed as well must have been a hurdle. \n\nThere is also nothing wrong with one partner doing to majority of the cooking. I truly enjoy it especially when cooking for others. As long as your reciprocating effort in other ways it works out just fine. Everyone has chores they hate and others they don't. \n\nOp ain't that though and that gets old very fast.", "So I get that he can\u2019t cook. He should definitely be doing the dishes though.", "Well, I have no choice but to accept that as true, but damn. You absolutely, 100% write like someone who speaks English well, but as a second (or third) language. \n\n>Thank you, I'll do that and I'll learn to do these stuff\n\n>I'll tell I want to learn although maybe she'll get mad or not, idk\n\n>My mom did those stuff when I was living with her\n\nThat's great, you have multiple languages. But I actually don't believe that English is your first language. This reads more like a Scandinavian (Swedish, etc) speaker.", "My wife and I split stuff up with her doing the cooking and me doing most of the cleaning (I don\u2019t mind cleaning, it\u2019s sort of therapeutic for me). I think I\u2019ve realized more recently that I feel like I have too many home responsibilities, so her and I have been talking about that. Part of the issue is me giving up control because I tend to want things done a certain way and I think that aspect prevents my wife from offering to help more. Definitely trying to figure out how to find a good middle spot (and loosen my grip).\n\nAlso, my wife cleans the shower because I fucking loathe that chore. Lol", "YES he should be doing the dishes but a step further - *he should be learning how to cook* instead of just talking about his incompetence. I\u2019m not even talking anything crazy, I bet gf would be ecstatic if he made grilled cheese sandwiches and tomato soup out of a can, or spaghetti, or throw stew ingredients in a crockpot.", "Agreed. This is definitely not a native English speech pattern.", "this whole post is fake. OP is obviously not a native English speaker.", "Good communication is key for sure!!! Sounds like you guys will get it sorted out just might take a little time.\n\n Cleaning the shower is the worst.", " I am a nurse and lived the other side of this whole situation. I separated from my husband over this kind of shit after putting up with it for years and it took that for him to realize how much ive been shouldering. Your profession does not excuse you from chores. In addition to that, I'd hate to see what your patients and their rooms look like by the end of your shift if you claim you can't clean. Sure, there's house keeping, but there's a level of cleaning and organization nursing also maintains."]}
