We rented a new and more spacious apartment together, we split rent and most of the expenses (according to our wages). We both work, I have a full time job and she works part time. I'll answer more questions if needed.\n\nI am a terrible cook, I don't like it at all and every time I try to cook something is tastes awful, so my girlfriend cooks most of our meals. Tbh also I don't do many of the household chores, it's not that I want my girlfriend to do everything on her own, but I was living with my mom before moving out and she used to do everything. I do other stuff and I do chores when asked. This is a small issue between us, but not as big.\n\nYesterday I came back from work (around 8) and my girlfriend was cooking for us, we had dinner and then she was washing the dishes. We were chatting while she cleaned, then I went to hug her while she was putting everything on place (the seasonings and that kind of stuff), by this time it was like an hour later. I was trying to hug her and kiss her but she was like \"leave me alone a sec\" and moving away. She wasn't angry, she was just busy. \n\nThen I let her go and tell her something like \"why are you so cold\" in a whiny voice, I was trying to be funny. She then snapped \"why are you so high maintenance?\"\n\nI was kinda shock by her tone, I thought she was joking and I said \"you're for real?\" And she said \"yeah, I love you but you're high maintenance, sometimes I can't with you\"\n\nThen I got upset and I told her I'll leave her alone and left to our bedroom. Around maybe 15 minutes later she comes in and was trying to talk to me, but I was kinda ignoring her and giving her short answers because I didn't wanted to talk to her. She asked me what was going on and I told her that we were joking around until she started saying stuff that hurt. She then went off me, she told me I never help or if I do she has to tell me what to do, she says she feels like she's my mom sometimes. We argued and now we're on a tight spot.", "created_utc": 1681236581, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12is7my/aita_for_being_upset_after_my_girlfriend_called/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's also a great recipe that serves as a springboard for many other things, it may take a few times to get the hang of it but it's a great beginning.

I'll answer more questions if needed.\n\nI am a terrible cook, I don't like it at all and every time I try to cook something is tastes awful, so my girlfriend cooks most of our meals. Tbh also I don't do many of the household chores, it's not that I want my girlfriend to do everything on her own, but I was living with my mom before moving out and she used to do everything. I do other stuff and I do chores when asked. This is a small issue between us, but not as big.\n\nYesterday I came back from work (around 8) and my girlfriend was cooking for us, we had dinner and then she was washing the dishes. We were chatting while she cleaned, then I went to hug her while she was putting everything on place (the seasonings and that kind of stuff), by this time it was like an hour later. I was trying to hug her and kiss her but she was like \"leave me alone a sec\" and moving away. She wasn't angry, she was just busy. \n\nThen I let her go and tell her something like \"why are you so cold\" in a whiny voice, I was trying to be funny. She then snapped \"why are you so high maintenance?\"\n\nI was kinda shock by her tone, I thought she was joking and I said \"you're for real?\" And she said \"yeah, I love you but you're high maintenance, sometimes I can't with you\"\n\nThen I got upset and I told her I'll leave her alone and left to oir bedroom. Around maybe 15 minutes later she comes in and was trying to talk to me, but I was kinda ignoring her and giving her short answers because I didn't wanted to talk to her. She asked me what was going on and I told her that we were joking around until she started saying stuff that hurt. She then went off me, she told me I never help or if I do she has to tell me what to do, she says she feels like she's my mom sometimes. We argued and now we're on a tight spot.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I get to put love and care into something and then sit down at the end of the day and share that product with the person whom I most care about in the world. When she says she really likes something I've cooked, it makes my night. The satisfaction I get from having a partner whom I respect and who respects me back is amazing. I would absolutely loathe myself if she ever accused me of being incompetent or useless. \n\nAlso, don't put the mental load on her to tell you what needs to be done or, even worse, to teach you. Get on Google or read some instructions. Pay attention to your surroundings. Use your big boy brain to analyze what chores need doing.
