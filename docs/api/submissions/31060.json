I have a younger sister Angela (34) and a younger brother Paul (27). My younger sister has a 12 year old daughter, Emma, who has been acting out lately. She's been cutting class, has gotten her phone taken away multiple times at school, has been shopping online excessively using her mom's card, and being generally disobedient to her parents and her other siblings. \n\nThis came to a head when recently, her and her older brother Ben (15) got into a fight over the mess she was making around the house. From what I've been told, he snatched her phone and refused to give it back until their parents came home (both were at work). Emma grabbed the home phone and literally dialed 911 saying someone had broken in. Cops arrived and my sister frantically phoned me to see if I could drive over and talk to them as she and her husband were still at work. When I arrived I was told by the police what had happened (they deduced it was a false report). The police reprimanded Emma for making a fake claim and told me that their parents should be supervising them, as if I hadn't come they both would have been taken to the station under temporary police custody. \n\nMy sister and her husband were furious to say the least. It seems like this was the straw that finally broke the camel's back. They started looking into boarding school after the incident but they asked me if I could take Emma in to our holiday house in the countryside for a few weeks because they feel her being away from everything else and helping out at the local farms might improve her mental health. My younger brother is pursuing his doctorate in another state so he isn't available. \n\nMy wife and I don't have kids and we already took time off from work for the holidays, but I was hesitant to do this. My wife was on board with it, as she wanted to fix up the holiday home a bit and felt Emma could help with that as well, but she also feels that we should help Emma as she and her parents are both struggling, but I told her that watching a teenager (much less an unruly teenager) would be a big responsibility. \n\nMy younger brother agrees with my wife and our parents are taking a neutral stance on this. They've babysitted for Angela's kids before and know about Emma's behavior.\n\nSo I'm torn on what I should do.

Her parents are behaving terribly in trying to fob her off on someone else. They're the ones who need to get themselves in gear and tackle the problem. Do not do this to yourself.", " NTA. It would be risky to take her in when you\u2019re unequipped. Unless you know what you\u2019re doing, definitely don\u2019t take in a minor who is having behavioral issues. What if she runs away? Gets hurt? Gets arrested? Hurts someone else?\n\nIf your niece could be trusted to act right, then I\u2019d say you should take her in because it will probably be fun.

Taking care of a child with the problems your niece has is something you do not have the training to do. You are right - this is a big responsibility, and you don't know what will happen if you niece decides to act up while she is with you. Your wife seems to think that your niece will be a willing helper fixing up the holiday home, which sounds naive when dealing with a rebellious, troubled teen.\n\nThis doesn't sound like your sister is trying to solve the problem - it sounds like she is trying to give it to someone else because she is tired. She says \"a few weeks,\" but that can easily wind up being longer, even if you have a firm date that she is supposed to go home.\n\nTaking in a troubled teen is something that you should not do if you have any doubts about it.", "Emma needs to speak to a therapist or counselor to find out what's going on. Her parents clearly don't know why she's acting out in such an aggressive and angry manner. I seriously doubt removing her from the situation will fix things. Even if she were to calm down in OP's care, she'd still have to face the same demons when she came home.\n\nNTA. But her parents are if they don't get her the help she needs.", "NTA\nThis isn\u2019t a movie where you take her to the country and she comes back refreshed and loving everyone.

And that\u2019s only if she doesn\u2019t act up and potentially get into legal trouble that could come back on you.", "Your sister wants to dump her rebelious teenager on you so she don't have to care for her for a while ? Hell no. She needs structure and parental supervision. \n\nNTA.", "NTA: Being responsible for a child's well-being is a significant responsibility that requires a willingness. It sounds like you are not on board. I do not blame you, especially with the rise of rebellious teenagers who are committing crimes. Emma does not sound far off from committing a crime. She is dangerous for lying to the cops. What would happen if the cop wasn't calm and collected? I would not welcome this into my household.\n\nEmma should be placed in a scared straight program and receive counseling to get to the root of the rebellion. \n\nIf you still that you need to act as your family village, consider taking Ben in.

Their parenting style isn\u2019t working for Emma and a 3 week vacation with uncle isn\u2019t going to make her be a responsible kid.

Your sister and her husband need to find an experienced therapist asap.

I don't blame you for being hesitant to take in an unruly teenager who won't listen to their parents / the adults in their life. Especially during the holidays, when I'm sure you were hoping to relax a little and not supervise / rehabilitate a wild kid.", "NTA. They need to take care of their own problems, not dump her on you. Emma needs real therapy and discipline.... do they have military school out there?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to do something of such great responsibility if you\u2019re uncomfortable.

I wouldn\u2019t want the risk, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to help anyway. Your niece doesn\u2019t need the countryside; she needs a therapist and/or doctor.", "NTA. That job could easily turn out to be above your paygrade. It is Emma's parents' job to raise her, for better or worse. They can't just dump her on relatives and expect them to fix her. It sounds to me like Emma needs something that she has not been getting through her childhood. Hopefully it will not be too late for her parents to do something for her. At this stage, therapy could well be warranted.", "Nta - run Forrest run", "NTA. It sounds like it would be a bad idea to take your niece into your household with her previous behaviors. It would probably only cause you problems. \n\nBut you may want to talk to your nephew Ben and see if he would like a vacation with you during the holiday as a getaway from his sister's atrocious behavior. But that is only if you are willing to have someone spending time with you and your wife during your vacation.", "YWNBTA. Emma needs actual parenting, support, and understanding, maybe from a professional. Hauling her off to the farm for a while will be seen as punishment, and will make things even worse than they are. Emma will feel more like a problem child, and now she's a problem child whose parents don't even want her around. Rather than trying to connect or communicate with their daughter, they're trying to foist her off onto you, which is really bad parenting.\n\nThen there's what they're asking of you: to somehow \"fix\" their issues with their daughter, with no direction, no plan, and no guarantee that she won't act out even more. \n\nIt's a bad idea that will hurt everyone. I get that her parents are out of ideas, but this is not the solution.", "You would be NTA for *not* doing this. That said, I'm inclined to say her wild behavior is a combination of entering the teenage phase and also acting out for attention; it sounds like she and her brother are latchkey kids. A short trip isn't going to address any of this and certainly not magically fix anything, but I won't disagree that it may be nice for her. Though I don't believe she'd be on that bad of behavior with you, especially if phones are not allowed, if you chose to do it, you should tell your sister to understand that this trip is the equivalent of hitting a pause button on her life- it's not a meaningful solution to anything. I also support you drawing a hard line and choosing to enjoy your time off without this added responsibility.", "If she'll report them then she'll report you.

Emma did not turn out this way overnight. It's their fault that they didn't look into this issue and have poor parenting skills. On top of that Emma will feel like she got rejected which won't help the issue, it will worsen it. \nThis girl is troubled for some reason. They need to grow TF up, get her diagnosed and help her! Ps. Lots of kids that went thru traumatic events start to misbehave. I'm not saying she was SA for example but they need to get to the bottom of it instead of getting rid of the problem - sending her away to you. She can be bullied, SAd, have ADHD or whatever else but there is a reason she's acting out. THEY as parents need to figure it out.", "You're NTA it isn't your job to take care of of your sister's daughter cause she can't discipline her and I fail to see what she would expect to happen. Emma needs discipline like REAL discipline cause from what I've read and correct me if I'm wrong she thinks that there are no consequences for her actions and that needs to change or she will end up making a terrible choice down the line that will effect her for the rest of her life.", "NTA - you would be putting yourself at risk.", "NTA. Don\u2019t take in your niece.  You could in legal and financial trouble you could never get out of.

Boarding schools ar ok in the right circumstances but expecting them to fix their problem child is not ok.", "NTA.\n\nKind of condescending to your wife, though.

It\u2019s a huge responsibility that isn\u2019t yours to own. \n\nAlternatively, you and/or your wife could offer to take her out and have a talk with her. If she feels closer or more open with one or both of you. Just getting her to open up and feel able to express her feelings freely, while knowing whomever isn\u2019t going to tell anyone can be very freeing. Trust is everything at that age. If she can have an open conversation with an adult that isn\u2019t a parent or someone sitting in judgement, it can go far.\n\nThat said, if neither of you feel that you\u2019re comfortable this, don\u2019t do it. But what they\u2019re asking as far as you taking her in is not going to work if you and your wife aren\u2019t both completely on board. Which you aren\u2019t, as it sounds, and there\u2019s not a thing wrong with that.\n\nBest of luck to you and don\u2019t feel bad.", "NTA. Your niece needs mental health counselling and parenting and clear consequences for her actions. You shouldn\u2019t be put in a position to have oversee this. Her parents need to find another solution.", "NTA  Taking in a troubled teenager is no easy task, especially one who feels they're unwanted and been kicked out of their own home. She needs therapy. Let her know if things get too intense for her at home she's welcome to stay with you but there would be rules if she does. Let it be her choice instead of feeling like she was kicked out.", "NTA\n\nThis is your sister\u2019s child to parent, not yours. She needs to figure out why Emma is acting out this way, not send her off to boarding school or your place for a few weeks. Yes, being a parent sucks sometimes, but maybe she could try actually being a parent for once.", "I note that a close reading of the episode reveals that the confrontation was in fact initiated by the older brother, not the daughter. According to the OP, brother started a fight and then snatched his sister's phone out of her hand and refused to return it. It very much looks like part of what's troubling the girl is that she is being bullied by her parentified golden-child elder brother, who thinks he has the right - perhaps encouraged by his mother - to order his younger sister around. She is, quite understandably, resisting. I would have, too.\n\nI would not be surprised if a LOT of the episodes in which daughter 'acts out' follow this same pattern: big brother bullies his sister until she has an explosive reaction, and then the entire family shakes their heads and decides she's 'troubled'.\n\nIn psych terms, daughter is what's often termed the 'identified patient'; ie, the victim who is acting out, usually because they're on the bottom of the pecking order and so under the most stress. But the truth is, *the entire family dynamic is what's sick*, and as the youngest, daughter likely had the least to do with it. Acting out is the only control the girl has over what is for her likely to be an intolerable situation.\n\nOP is NTA. The girl's mother - or at any rate her parents - are my best candidates for TA. In any case, sending the girl away is exactly the wrong thing to do. OP, tell your sister that what's needed is family therapy, not abandoning inconvenient daughter to other family members.\n\n\\~\\~\n\nWhen your children are young, it is not unreasonable for parents to use older children to supervise younger children. But that all goes out the window when the younger child becomes a teen. That's the age when it is developmentally appropriate for people to begin to rebel against parental authority. To individuate, and become their own person. But if they have a parentified older sibling, they suddenly have a THIRD 'parent' whose shackles they need to cast off, and one, moreover, who they know isn't a real parent at all. In this position, the real parent's duty if to reinforce the younger; and not the elder. If you help them to realize their their parents are their parents, and their siblings *aren't*, you're doing the right thing. Encourage the elder to stand down on the supervision. Because if you get this wrong - if you support the elder as a quasi parent through the teen years - you risk an outcome FAR more damaging to your younger child. Often, to that child's detriment, as they feel they have to pursue ever more damaging acting out strategies that ruin their lives.\n\nI was that child. And the result has been life-long depression and suicide attempts. I gave up fighting back when it became obvious that my parents would *never* have my back against my sister, no matter what she did. The consequence was depression. Yes, it will - temporarily - disrupt your life to have to step back in and take over parenting your child, instead of deputising your eldest to do it for you. But are you willing to kill your child for a peaceful life?", "NTA - Although none of these behaviors are that unusual for teens lashing out.  She has not really escalated to harmful and illegal stuff yet.  My opinion is that most of these can be headed off with more supervision (by an adult, not a 15 y/o brother).  Take her phone and computer away and make sure she is watched more closely by a parent or trusted adult.", "It sounds like a more structured and neutral situation could be needed\u2026.

That would be different. \n\nThis girl is acting out for a reason. And if they fob her off on you because of this behavior without trying to figure what is happening she will never forgive them, and she will see this as further evidence that they don\u2019t love her. \n\nShe needs immediate counseling to help her communicate more effectively about her feelings and to have someone really listen to see what is happening.

Please don\u2019t get involved in this mess. Nothing good will come of it.", "NTA. It's totally your choice and it's perfectly reasonable to not want a kid like that in your house. Although, if it were me, I'd take her. Your wife and your sister have some good points; it sounds like some time away from her friends, her parents, her siblings, and school would be good for your niece. It would be good for her not to have anyone her age around to argue with, and I think it's much better than just sending her straight to boarding school. Boarding school will help her behavior, but it will probably make her miserable and resent her parents for years after. Spending time with someone who's family but not so close is perfect, because you have too much authority over her for her to act up the way she would with her teachers, but you're not close enough for her to act up the way she would with her parents and siblings. I also agree that working on a farm and helping your wife with house renovations will be good for improving her mental health. Honestly, if you're welcoming to her and don't make her go to school, there's not much she can do. Even if she has no qualms about misbehaving in your house the way she does in her parents', she will know that if she does something that really upsets you or your wife, that you'll just send her back to her parents, and that they'll send her off to boarding school. And even if she hates your guts, I bet she'd prefer living at her uncle's house to that.", "NTA.  \n\nChat with your wife tho & come to a conclusion together.

She can blow up your relationship with your sister and BIL who will be torn about who to believe.\n\nBest thing you can do is to never be alone with your niece until she gets straightened out.

Sounds like Emma will destroy the holiday home out of spite the first time she's asked to do a chore. Not your circus, not your monkey.

Both kids are troublemakers,  the boy is a  thief and the girl is a liar. \n\n\nYou and wife do not want to get in the middle of their problems. They created the mess and they can deal with it. A couple of weeks of forced volunteering isn't going to teach her anything but resentment. \n\n\nIf she's willing to call in a false police report for a phone,  she'll be calling CPS claiming she's being abused and held against her will if she's forced to go to the country.", "NTA\nIf she makes a false claim like that against her brother what will stop her from lying that you touched her innapropriately when she doesn't get her way?\n\"Good for her mental health\" how about putting her in therapy or sending her to a programme designed for teens like her.

They're fobbing off their kid on OP, who is unqualified. This is a mess of the parents' making, and they need to clean it up themselves.", "I agree, and if you do decide to take her and you need to have a conversation with her and her parents regarding rules and expectations if she\u2019s not willing to follow through then parents need to do whatever it is they need to do. I would think counseling would be part of that.", "It sounds like she\u2019s trying to pass her off until she can send her to boarding school and be fully rid of her, which is pretty awful. \n\nAlso I\u2019m curious why the brother took her phone? I doubt he would do so just if she was misbehaving, so it most likely had something to do specifically with the phone. As much as I hate invasions like this, have the parents checked her phone? Maybe there is something she has on it that could give an idea what\u2019s happening. But seriously this girl needs help, not to be pushed off on anyone who will take her.", "\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\u2b06\ufe0f\n\nI agree, your wife is rather naive to think your niece will suddenly be a 'helper' with renos.", "Never the brother. The entire problem, I'll wager, is the brother's attempts to 'supervise' - ie, dominate - his sister, with either the tacit or overt encouragement of her negligent parents.", ">She has not really escalated to harmful and illegal stuff yet.\n\nI'd agree with you right up until she called the cops reporting a break in because her brother took her phone.\n\nThat was both\n\n1. Harmful. It could have gotten her brother shot.\n2. Illegal.\n\nIf she can't be made to understand that, that's boarding school worthy to me. \n\nWhat else is she going to false report? I wouldn't be alone with that kid.", "She's 12 bro. Chill.", "I think calling her troubled and saying she'd just call the cops on any whim is a bit of a stretch. This was clearly the first time she'd called them like that, and with the impressions I'm getting about her, I'm betting her and her brother were both riling each other up and that was the culmination of it. I do agree that her parents should've done better, though.", "Right? This whole story is wild. They are seriously failing their children and then trying to make it everyone else\u2019s problem.", "I am not saying she is \u201csick\u201d in any way, what I mean with \u201ctroubled\u201d is that her hormones are on a rampage, and she\u2019s not able to think clearly. \n\nA friend of ours was a troubled teenager, a teenager from hell, seriously anti everything. She would rile you up and down and square just because. And she wouldn\u2019t care or give any thought about consequences for her or other, none!\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be the first time a teenager would do some serious crap like accusing somebody falsely.", "Definitely agreed. I just mean that I don't think she would make the same sort of accusation against her uncle as she would against her brother, someone she's a lot closer to and probably has a rivalry with. Also, I bet she wasn't expecting the cops to threaten to arrest her. I doubt she'll be trying that again anytime soon. It's probably for the best that she's 12 and not 16."]}
