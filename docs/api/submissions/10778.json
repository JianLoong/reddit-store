It\u2019s no joke to say that we\u2019re basically closer than brothers. I know everything about him and the same goes for him. We\u2019re part of a friend group that has known each other for years and years.\n\nLucas has a wife, May (28F) who is fine but she\u2019s very serious and can be a bit overbearingingly clingy and boring. She doesn\u2019t really fit in with our friend group. It just devolves into awkward silence and her trying to monopolize Lucas all the time and be really prying. Even Lucas gets tired of her. Plus she texts him literally all the time and he usually has to mute notifications from her. \n\nWe\u2019ve been planning a group trip to hit up Southeast Asia for a while now and we finally got to go. We were worried that May would want to come along so we made it clear that it was just the friend group. We also had a policy where we would try to be as low contact as possible. May agreed to not text/call Lucas at all during our trip and me and Lucas even switched phones so he wouldn\u2019t pick up which May knew about. \n\nThe trip was a blast at first but Lucas started getting weird. He kept asking me if May had contacted him yet and to my surprise she hadn\u2019t at all. He didn\u2019t believe me and snatched it from my hand to check. a couple night he even rummaged through my backpack to check his phone. I shut it down. He got more pissy every day I think because he realized that May was totally capable of not spamming him with messages all this time and just now finally did it. \n\nWhen our trip was over, our flight arrived early but May picked us up from the airport when she said she would arrive instead of coming earlier. Lucas asked her if she missed him and May said \u201cof course I did\u201d. Apparently all she did was read books and lounge around the house. Lucas was understandably annoyed and she realized and asked him what was wrong so I thought I would say something and make my buddy feel better. \n\nI said that Lucas had an awesome time in SEA. He was just annoyed to be back home in boring town. I added that we didn\u2019t realize that she could stop herself from texting so much and that we would\u2019ve gone on the trip sooner if we had known (which was a joke). May said she was happy Lucas had fun and sorry for texting so much before. I thought it was over and settled but Lucas cussed me out later and called me an asshole but she didn\u2019t seem hurt. She even laughed? AITA?\n\nEdit: May made the jokes about herself before too that she texts too much and is like that. \n\nLucas was the one who suggested the \u201cno texting\u201d thing when we brought up our concerns. He also mutes only her texts/notifications not anybody else\u2019s because she spams him so much.\n\nI thought I was making a lighthearted joke", "created_utc": 1677208530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ah12s/aita_for_talking_about_my_friends_wifes_texting/", "score": 795, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He *likes* feeling loved and needed.\n\nHis first question upon return was to check if she missed him.\n\nYou\u2019re projecting your dislike of May onto Lucas, and being rude to both of them in the process.", "You... are not as good at reading people as you think you are. It's obvious that May isn't as clingy as you think she is, that Luke LIKES it when May texts him, it makes him feel missed and he misses her, too, and that you're the immature oddball in your friend group. I'm sure right now they're all saying YTA.", "YTA. What is your problem? Luca clearly loves his wife and was disappointed that she wasn't contacting him. You have some strange problem with May and need to deal with it. You've tried to isolate her from your group and Luca isn't playing. You need to realize you're the problem.", "YTA- You're comment was not a joke and you know it. She probably laughed it off because she was embarrassed. Your friend was right to cuss you out. Obviously your friend doesn't mind her texting, only you.", "YTA.  You say you're closer than brothers, but you've done the following to a person he loves and is committed to:\n1. Exclude her.\n2.  Keep her from communicating with him.\n3. Belittle her after she picked you up from the airport.\n\nI find it very interesting that you keep assuming or intuiting how you think he feels.  But you've never asked him.  And apparently you aren't close enough that he's volunteered how he feels about it. He knows her behavior bothers YOU and so he tries to hide it from YOU but it seems like he actually likes it when she pays attention to him.", "Way too many words to say that OP is in love with his best friend. \n\nOh, and YTA.", "YtA. He married her for a reason. You might know him for long but you're not him. You don't know what he needs to feel loved and taken care off. Let them be.", "YTA and you seem very controlling.   You \"shut down\" someone checking their own phone, and you were incredibly rude to his wife.  Why do you get to decide for them how in contact they are? Its not about you....", "YTA- You are the problem.  Not May.  \n\nIt sounds like Lucas is going along with your tasteless \u201cjokes\u201d to humour you, and is probably at home complaining to May that you don\u2019t stop bitching about her texts.  I\u2019d mute my notifications too if the person I was with whined every time one popped up.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re jealous of Lucas and May\u2019s relationship or just jealous that she takes his attention away from you.  Either way, stop trying to come between your friend and his wife.  He will choose her, and you\u2019ll lose your friend.", "YTA. You were deliberately rude to her, with no provocation. It's none of your business how often she texts her husband.", "YTA for assuming that because someone laughed they couldn't have been offended. \n\n\"I lied and had to laugh\" is a conflict avoidance technique.", "YTA. Yeah I can\u2019t even read the full story, it\u2019s too weird.  I have never heard of a married dude going on a trip to another country and going no contact with his spouse. In addition the fact that you all hate her and act that that\u2019s totally normal is really immature. You\u2019re pretty much all TAs.", "YTA and i had to do a double take that you are 27 good lord", "YTA\n\nI think he enforced the rule because he was annoyed at her obsessive texting, and also because he didn\u2019t want that to ruin your trip as well. But that doesn\u2019t mean he wanted you to speak over him with his wife. Maybe the texting bothers him way more than it bothers you, maybe the texting is comforting to him and he doesn\u2019t *really* mind it much.\n\nIt sounds like he kinda just assumed she couldn\u2019t resist and when she didn\u2019t message at all it took away the dynamic they had and he felt weird. You really do know how to punch down though. And the way you describe yourself and Lucas (besties, know everything about each other, closer than brothers, etc) vs his wife (she\u2019s very boring, so clingy, everyone is tired of her including her husband, she doesn\u2019t fit in and we don\u2019t want her on group trips) is weird. Feels weird. Why did he marry her if she acts like this or he doesn\u2019t like her lol", "You seem to have excluded May from day 1, and made her feel unwelcome. Your behaviour seems consistent with this assumption- like your comments to her on returning. You have just put your friend in a terrible spot- he is going to have to choose between the two of you real soon. YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019ve effectively alienated your friend from his wife and, more to the point, given her the space to become emotionally alienated from him. But you\u2019ll still have your friend to party with when he\u2019s single again!", "YTA.  You\u2019re clearly very jealous of your friends relationship with his wife.  This manipulation backfired for you, didn\u2019t it?  She didn\u2019t ask to go on the trip you were determined to exclude her from, she didn\u2019t text and guess what?  He missed her! \n\nJokes on you and you are the joke, and the asshole.  Time to grow up.", "YTA - Go back and read your own post. You obviously don't like May and seem eager to exclude her. Well, your friend married her. She's more important to him than you are. He was nervous about his communication routine with her being disrupted even though she just stuck to the agreement and let you guys have a good time. \n\nThat's a good sign you shouldn't make fun of her for it.\n\nIf nothing else, think of it as how people treat their siblings - they can make fun of themselves, big brother can pick on little brother or vice-versa, but big brother will fight anyone else that picks on little brother. \n\nYour friend was on edge and your disposition towards May makes it different than when she pokes fun at herself.", "YTA. She was asked not to text and she didn't and this upsets you somehow? What?", "YTA. All you proved here is that May is actually more chill and mature than all of you. You and your friends sound exhausting. May sounds totally great. So cool, you accomplished proving to your friend that he loves his wife.", "YTA. Everyone else has explained why well, I just wanted you to know another person agrees with them, lol. \n\n(Also, it's totally possible that he's only sometimes annoyed by her texting. It's way different getting spammed by someone who you're going to see again in two hours than it is getting to speak to your wife while you're half the world away. Guy was probably a little homesick and wanted reassurance.)", "You don't know Lucas nearly as well as you think you do. Muting texts doesn't mean you don't love your spouse, being annoyed with your spouse doesn't mean you don't love them. The very fact you took his phone and wouldn't give it back is fucking weird and controlling. Your \"joke\" like the rest of your comments about May are immature and sound jealous.. YTA", "YTA. Damn stop trying to sabotage their marriage.", "YTA. \n\nI wanna know how many of the people in the \u201cfriends group\u201d are wives or partners that were \u201callowed\u201d to join and go on this trip but May wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been the partner that just never fit in with the established group before, and man does it suck.", " What is the point of mentioning that \u201call she did was read books and lounge around the house\u201d? Was she supposed to cry and to be miserable because you purposely excluded her from a trip and then isolated her from her husband? YTA big time\u2026", "YTA  Lucas sounds like someone who was taking his wife for granted and found out that *gasp* he likes talking to his wife and misses her when he's gone. And he seemed to want reassurance that she missed him too. Butt out of their marriage. You sound like a 3rd wheel who is bitter that someone who you're \"closer than brothers\" with found a wife and comes between the two of you.", "oh, YTA. ooof. How would you respond if you were the one reading this about someone else? Yikes.", "YTA. Friend relationships change and all you did was switch his loyalty to her. May won.", "Your friend and his wife had a dynamic going and he felt pressured to change it. His wife did fine. Didn\u2019t call, whatever, while he was craving her contact. There is a lot of distinction here and if I were your friend I would feel like maybe I saw signs I am growing beyond a friend group. And maybe I miss my wife a lot more than I thought I would. And maybe she is done with this stupidity with my friends. Yta.", "YTA, full stop.", "YTA. How long have you been in love with your friend? And how upset are you that turning them against each other isn\u2019t going well for you?", "Clearly Luke missed the texting.\nAnd seems like it bothered OP and the friend group for whatever reason.\nThe wife seems chill due to how she followed the request to not \u201cspam\u201d.\nSometimes spouses may actually want to text and call each other. It\u2019s not unheard of. It just means they genuinely enjoy each others company.\nYTA", "YTA- you and your and whole group. She just wanted to enjoy and you did not accept her as doesn't 'fit' in and that friend is idiot who used to mute the notification and now realised he missed those. People need to understand spouse is important too, more than friends.", "YTA- Lucas doesn\u2019t hate getting all the texts messages from his wife, he just acts like he does around y\u2019all. Probably because you bitched so much about his wife that he felt like he need to go along with it. Clearly the only brothers you\u2019re \u201ccloser\u201d than are the estranged ones. And May has the right to be clingy and monopolize Lucas because he\u2019s her HUSBAND, which you very obviously don\u2019t like.\n\nAnd it\u2019s weird that you are so dead set on making May seem so unfun. You call her boring, and then point out that all she did was read and lounge around as if that\u2019s something bad, and then you say Lucas is sad to be back where it is boring, basically implying that he\u2019s sad to be back with his wife where it\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s almost as if you think you\u2019re better than her.\n\nAnd the fact that you decided she couldn\u2019t come on the vacation because she wasn\u2019t part of The Friend Group as if over all these years you guys haven\u2019t added anyone new in, or no one else has gotten married, is crazy. Are you telling me that absolutely none of your friends were allowed to bring any of their spouses? Or is Lucas the only one of you who has actually managed to find someone else who can put up with him?\n\nHonestly, YTA and so is everyone in your friend group including Lucas. May deserves better than all of you.", "YTA. Lucas gives me the impression that he likes to feel superior based on the context from the post. If he\u2019s getting this bent out of shape because she followed his wishes, he\u2019s got some control issues, Just my take on this.", "YTA. Majorly. You ice out his wife from the friend group, then make it clear you don\u2019t want her on this trip. Are you 27 or 5? Because you and your friend group are acting like a mean girl high school clique. Did you ever stop to think it gets uncomfortable because she knows you don\u2019t like her? So of course she\u2019d want to talk to the one person who actually likes her. If I were Lucas I\u2019d find a new friend group. Not one that acts like a bunch of ahS.", "YTA \n\nWe get it. Your jealous no one is that interested in you", "So, she\u2019s clingy if she does text and negligent if she doesn\u2019t? You kind of suck, dude.", "YTA\u2026 so tell us\u2026 how long have you wanted to bang your best friend because that\u2019s the only explanation I can find for you being so upset that his wife texts her husband \u201call the time\u201d as you put it.", "YTA and you\u2019re a weirdo for having so many issues with your friend\u2019s spouse for basically no reason", "I honestly think that you and your friends group should grow up a little as you\u2019re almost 30 and acting like you are 15.

Not when somene is super rude/abusive and says it was a joke to deflect responsibility. \n\nAs for boring...look in the mirror. Boring is between the ears. \n\nYou sound wildly jealous of your friend and his relationship. Your friend group sounds insufferable. It may be how you describe it, but you seem to go to great lengths to describe how awesome all of you are and how horrible May is. \n\nMaybe your friend is worried you all were so mean to her she didn't want to travel with you anyway and she has found someone that treats her well.", "R u in love with Lucas? Cause u sure as fuck resent May. YTA", "It's abundantly clear that dude loves his wife. Sounds like they love each other so much. They love communicating and being around each other but can handle space too.\n\nYou however, you're a piece of work.

Maybe thats because he realised his friend is honestly just controlling & jealous and he prefers her company after all. Your comments to her were uncalled for, not your place to speak for him, and sound more like a projection of your own feelings. Doesn't sound like the trip was \"a blast\" for him at all.", "I think you\u2019re in love w your friend and I\u2019m denial", "This is all a guess but: It sounds like Lucas was mad because he actually \\_likes\\_ feeling important and being love bombed and clinged to. He asked is she missed him immediately because she didn't contact him at all during the trip. He was annoyed to hear that she just read and hung out because she could have reached out and didn't.

It sounds like May might have an anxious attachment style. That may spring from something else that's happened in her past, or it could be because of something in her and Lucas' dynamic that makes her feel insecure. Either way, not contacting him cold turkey was probably really hard for her, but she did it to prove something to herself (positive) and all of you (which she shouldn't have had to do). On some level she will have been embarrassed that her \"clingyness\" was made such a thing of. She's an actual full human being, not just some annoying slew of notifications on your buddy's phone.", "Dude, you are clueless. He obviously loves his wife\u2019s attention towards him.

They treat in a condescending way their friends' wives. At family dinners there is a lot of that old school kind of jokes \"ihih what a trap, the marriage\". And this doesn't mean that they are homosexual at all. An interesting definition is that a lot of heterosexual men are sexually interested in women but they have their deeper, most important relationships based on actual respect and trust with men. This doesn't make them homosexual. It's a super common dynamic. Fraternities are of course a place of excellence to see these things but it isn't exclusively there.\n\nIt can be the case?

For all \u201cintents and purposes\u201d it was 100% his phone and the fact you were obsessed with stopping him from communication with his WIFE is absurd.", "Did you text her while you were in SEA, and say inappropriate things to her?", "Probably because his asshole group of \u201cfriends\u201d won\u2019t stop bothering him about it.", "Maybe because you and your emotional support group a.k.a. friends, give him shit about it all the time", "This. When I would start laughing during stressful work shifts that was when I knew I was at my breaking point.", "He isn\u2019t in love with anybody but himself and is pissy because his friend got married. It\u2019s ok to have feelings when a close friend marries and the friendship changes but it\u2019s not ok for him to bully the spouse, insult her, put her down and then rag on his friend about her. It\u2019s manipulative and abusive. People don\u2019t realize that friendships can be abusive too and this is a prime example. He probably makes Lucas feel terrible about his wife every time he sees him and due to being lifelong friends Lucas is in a shitty position.

Then OP interprets that as him winning Lucas' affections away from May.", "Yeah if he\u2019s normally great to her and has just been influenced by shitty friends she may have decided to teach him a little lesson by giving him what he asked for and if he can correct his behavior then he\u2019s worth keeping around.", "But note that he doesn\u2019t deny it! Honestly I kinda hope he\u2019s in love with this best friend because otherwise this behavior is truly unexplainable.", "Oh yeah, I definitely got the impression that Lucas is the only one even in a serious relationship among the group and that part of the purpose of the trip was to get him to ditch his wife and drive a wedge between them.", "Yeah OP seems to barely view Lucas as a person capable of having his own feelings and making his own choices\u2026 if he manages to get away from his \u201ccontrolling wife\u201d it becomes OP\u2019s job to control him because obviously this grown man can\u2019t be trusted to decide whether he texts someone or not or who he is/isn\u2019t angry with.", "Yeah I really don\u2019t understand the dynamic there. How is that something Lucas just accepts? Like who allows their friend to take their phone and refuse to give it back when they ask for weeks?", "Exactly, Lucas going so far as to rummage thru OP\u2019s backpack to check his phone are not the actions of a man bothered by his wife\u2019s texting.", "It\u2019s so weird!!!", "I think May knows that OP is a jerk and probably fights with Lucas about it.

He didn\u2019t believe me and snatched it from my hand to check. a couple night he even rummaged through my backpack to check his phone. I shut it down. He got more pissy every day I think because he realized that May was totally capable of not spamming him with messages all this time and just now finally did it.\n\nCongrats, good misunderstanding here.\n\nI think you all have finally got evidence that Lucas married a woman who texts like that *because he actively likes that about her*. Maybe he knew this all along and was just playing along with your groups, \"LOL ball and chain\" jokes because he felt pressured, or maybe he didn't realize how much he enjoyed knowing she was thinking about him when they were apart, maybe he's a bit of an asshole and actively enjoys both thinking his wife's life revolves around him and also giving her shit for that. It doesn't matter which one it is, ya'll need to stop giving Lucas and his wife shit for something that they chose to do.\n\nYTA. Lucas is an asshole if he asked his wife not to do something and then being annoyed that she listened to him, whether he realized he actually likes the texting or not. May is not an asshole.\n\nActually, I think May is the classiest of ladies for bringing up how your comments made her feel and addressing her marital issues privately with her husband later instead of in public. You realize Lucas cussed you out *later* because he and his wife had a conversation privately about the whole issue and you hurt her or otherwise caused him problems, right?", "YTA and a bad friend. Also, it sounds like you're jealous that your friend has a wife who gives him a ton of attention. Or rather, \"gave\" because you may have killed that for him.", "YTA. \n\nJust admit it- you don't like May and you wish Lucas would leave her so you two can be  single \"bros\" together again. Have you ever considered that maybe Lucas likes it when his wife texts him? But he can't say that because you and the others will be upset. Maybe let Lucan enjoy his marriage without shitting on his wife every chance you get.", "Is it just me, or is OP  way to involved in his friend's marriage.   \n\nIt sounds like Lucas already knows how to handle things with May.  He mutes her notifications when hangs out with you, which suggests he knows it is rude to ignore people he's hanging out with. \n\nMaybe Lucas likes all the constant attention.  Maybe Lucas likes May being needy because Lucas likes to be needed.    Or maybe he doesn't.  \n\nEither way, its not your place to police how much Lucas and May text each-other by taking Lucas' phone away for a trip, or telling May she texts too much.   Also, making jokes about another person's spouse is usually a bad idea.  Sooner or later those jokes get old or land wrong.    YTA", "NTA Lucas is a snowflake", "I feel sorry for May like if my husband was friends with people that talked like this behind my back I would just leave him.", "OP YTA if you stepped in between me and my spouse and into our relationship like this you wouldn\u2019t have a friend anymore.", "I think you might want rethink your attitude about his wife.YTA", "Thanks for including your age. I thought you both were 12 years old. YTA.", "YTA for getting so involved in your friends relationship. You should have saved the concern over the wife\u2019s texting for when it actually happened and then talked to him about it.  Like \u201chey man, can you be more present?\u201d Trading phones and talking to her like she\u2019s a child is just cruel. She\u2019s probably awkward and clingy around you because she doesn\u2019t feel accepted.   If you haven\u2019t destroyed your friendship I hope you take this lesson for the future and leave your self out of your friends relationship.  Right now you owe May a big apology and a commitment to be less of an ass going forward. Maybe try including her more as well.", "Lucas is definitely at fault. Just as as much as OP.", "Not to mention it\u2019s kinda crazy that they prevented him from texting her. they are in a different country than May, and she\u2019s home alone. It\u2019s completely reasonable to check on your spouse while you\u2019re gone.", "She probably laughed it off because she knew she\u2019s a mature, normal adult whereas OP is an immature over involved busybody. OP\u2019s rude comment just isn\u2019t worth her time getting worked up over when she\u2019s living her best life.", "I got the same vibe", "Because you\u2019re overbearing about his wife texting him when it\u2019s none of your business. He probably does it to placate you. Why else would he be upset?", "My dude, he literally married her. If this is one of her core habits, chances are on some level he likes it. He likes her. What don\u2019t you get about this? \n\nHe may mute because her texts can still be inconvenient at times. Or more likely, because you aren\u2019t particularly subtle and he\u2019s trying to save face in front of his friends.\n\nYou do realize most men act VERY differently in private with their significant others than they do in front of their guy friends right? Like you realize that, generally speaking, the bro-iest men on earth ask to be the little spoon while cuddling for hours? And send heart emojis in texts all day? And do the sappiest shit imaginable and love every second of it? And I know you\u2019ll be like, they only do that to get laid! Or because the chick makes them! No, no they don\u2019t. They love it. They love it, so so much. Honestly, a lot of the times the girl thinks it\u2019s a bit much but humors them because they think it\u2019s sweet. Your friend loves 99% of his wife\u2019s texts and was going into an emotional spiral without them. Because he loves his wife and therefore, he loves to get texts from her.", "To shut you up.", "honestly it sounds like she got a little vacation too, and op is salty about that. how dare she have a good time without op and lucas!!! /s", "I'm sorry I can not like this comment more than once.", "Maybe it\u2019s the recent trend in AITA posts . But I saw overseas trip with a bro and no phone allowed\u2026. They in love \u2764\ufe0f", "Right?!? If my partner wanted this, they wouldn\u2019t have to worry about ever hearing from me during the trip or ever again", "Weird and not ready to be in a committed relationship if your bros mean more to you than your wife.", "Exactly", "I remember that! I followed the guy that posted that no phones allowed trip and he\u2019s divorcing his wife and currently in a relationship with the friend. He made a tumblr and left after deleting some comments because someone found out his real name and posted it", "It seems like the friends who aren't married are the ones wanting their friends only trip. If OP was married, I doubt he would have planned a trip similar to this. \n\nPeople get married and change. I was extremely outgoing and fun. I got married and all that slowed down (kids helped). OP will change, too, if he ever gets married. It doesn't mean you hate your friends now. It just means you have other priorities and getting married means you share a life with someone. Not \"I'll be with the boys half the time and you the other half.\"", "That would have been the end of the relationship for me. Maybe May was getting her ducks in a row while he was out adventuring.", "I travel all the time without my husband because I love to travel and he doesn\u2019t. He will travel within North America but isn\u2019t interested in my Asia, South America, and Africa trips. I just go with friends or family. I pay for it myself. Not only does he not mind, he\u2019s just happy I don\u2019t ask him to go. We have very different travel interests. I know lots of other couples like this. It isn\u2019t weird at all.", "Also, knowing OP would be reading said texts. All kinds of ick. I wouldn\u2019t have sent anything.", "Lmaooo I read that yesterday!!! He for sure groomed the dude also\u2026.", "Me too. My husband and I frequently travel separately, but always text: made it to hotel, plane landed, good night, heading home, etc. If anything goes wrong at least I\u2019ll be looking for him before weeks go by and there is no way of finding out what happened.", "Especially when his \"friends\" talk shit about him texting his wife. He probably just doesn't want to hear them complain, so he mutes her.", "Honestly, if my husband behaved the way hers did, he'd be coming home to an empty house. I'd have used the time he was gone to get my shit together, prep for divorce, move all my things out, and find a new place. I'm not putting up with being excluded from a clique, this isn't fucking high school.", "That\u2019s the problem! OP can\u2019t let go of being #1 in friends life and is out to undermine wife\u2019s relationship with husband.", "He was probably upset because he thought that she'd be a basket case with not having the ability to text him. She was okay with not texting- he was bothered by it.\n\nAnd we can't go by OP about how often May texts her husband because he hates her.", "Very true - OP may find himself vacationing alone in a few years"]}
