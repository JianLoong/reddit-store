It\u2019s no joke to say that we\u2019re basically closer than brothers. I know everything about him and the same goes for him. We\u2019re part of a friend group that has known each other for years and years.\n\nLucas has a wife, May (28F) who is fine but she\u2019s very serious and can be a bit overbearingingly clingy and boring. She doesn\u2019t really fit in with our friend group. It just devolves into awkward silence and her trying to monopolize Lucas all the time and be really prying. Even Lucas gets tired of her. Plus she texts him literally all the time and he usually has to mute notifications from her. \n\nWe\u2019ve been planning a group trip to hit up Southeast Asia for a while now and we finally got to go. We were worried that May would want to come along so we made it clear that it was just the friend group. We also had a policy where we would try to be as low contact as possible. May agreed to not text/call Lucas at all during our trip and me and Lucas even switched phones so he wouldn\u2019t pick up which May knew about. \n\nThe trip was a blast at first but Lucas started getting weird. He kept asking me if May had contacted him yet and to my surprise she hadn\u2019t at all. He didn\u2019t believe me and snatched it from my hand to check. a couple night he even rummaged through my backpack to check his phone. I shut it down. He got more pissy every day I think because he realized that May was totally capable of not spamming him with messages all this time and just now finally did it. \n\nWhen our trip was over, our flight arrived early but May picked us up from the airport when she said she would arrive instead of coming earlier. Lucas asked her if she missed him and May said \u201cof course I did\u201d. Apparently all she did was read books and lounge around the house. Lucas was understandably annoyed and she realized and asked him what was wrong so I thought I would say something and make my buddy feel better. \n\nI said that Lucas had an awesome time in SEA. He was just annoyed to be back home in boring town. I added that we didn\u2019t realize that she could stop herself from texting so much and that we would\u2019ve gone on the trip sooner if we had known (which was a joke). May said she was happy Lucas had fun and sorry for texting so much before. I thought it was over and settled but Lucas cussed me out later and called me an asshole but she didn\u2019t seem hurt. She even laughed? AITA?\n\nEdit: May made the jokes about herself before too that she texts too much and is like that. \n\nLucas was the one who suggested the \u201cno texting\u201d thing when we brought up our concerns. He also mutes only her texts/notifications not anybody else\u2019s because she spams him so much.\n\nI thought I was making a lighthearted joke", "created_utc": 1677208530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ah12s/aita_for_talking_about_my_friends_wifes_texting/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He *likes* feeling loved and needed.\n\nHis first question upon return was to check if she missed him.\n\nYou\u2019re projecting your dislike of May onto Lucas, and being rude to both of them in the process.", "You... are not as good at reading people as you think you are. It's obvious that May isn't as clingy as you think she is, that Luke LIKES it when May texts him, it makes him feel missed and he misses her, too, and that you're the immature oddball in your friend group. I'm sure right now they're all saying YTA.", "YTA. What is your problem? Luca clearly loves his wife and was disappointed that she wasn't contacting him. You have some strange problem with May and need to deal with it. You've tried to isolate her from your group and Luca isn't playing. You need to realize you're the problem.", "YTA- You're comment was not a joke and you know it. She probably laughed it off because she was embarrassed. Your friend was right to cuss you out. Obviously your friend doesn't mind her texting, only you.", "YTA.  You say you're closer than brothers, but you've done the following to a person he loves and is committed to:\n1. Exclude her.\n2.  Keep her from communicating with him.\n3. Belittle her after she picked you up from the airport.\n\nI find it very interesting that you keep assuming or intuiting how you think he feels.  But you've never asked him.  And apparently you aren't close enough that he's volunteered how he feels about it. He knows her behavior bothers YOU and so he tries to hide it from YOU but it seems like he actually likes it when she pays attention to him.", "Way too many words to say that OP is in love with his best friend. \n\nOh, and YTA.", "YtA. He married her for a reason. You might know him for long but you're not him. You don't know what he needs to feel loved and taken care off. Let them be.", "YTA and you seem very controlling.   You \"shut down\" someone checking their own phone, and you were incredibly rude to his wife.  Why do you get to decide for them how in contact they are? Its not about you....", "YTA- You are the problem.  Not May.  \n\nIt sounds like Lucas is going along with your tasteless \u201cjokes\u201d to humour you, and is probably at home complaining to May that you don\u2019t stop bitching about her texts.  I\u2019d mute my notifications too if the person I was with whined every time one popped up.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re jealous of Lucas and May\u2019s relationship or just jealous that she takes his attention away from you.  Either way, stop trying to come between your friend and his wife.  He will choose her, and you\u2019ll lose your friend.", "YTA. You were deliberately rude to her, with no provocation. It's none of your business how often she texts her husband.", "YTA for assuming that because someone laughed they couldn't have been offended. \n\n\"I lied and had to laugh\" is a conflict avoidance technique.", "YTA. Yeah I can\u2019t even read the full story, it\u2019s too weird.  I have never heard of a married dude going on a trip to another country and going no contact with his spouse. In addition the fact that you all hate her and act that that\u2019s totally normal is really immature. You\u2019re pretty much all TAs.", "YTA and i had to do a double take that you are 27 good lord", "YTA\n\nI think he enforced the rule because he was annoyed at her obsessive texting, and also because he didn\u2019t want that to ruin your trip as well. But that doesn\u2019t mean he wanted you to speak over him with his wife. Maybe the texting bothers him way more than it bothers you, maybe the texting is comforting to him and he doesn\u2019t *really* mind it much.\n\nIt sounds like he kinda just assumed she couldn\u2019t resist and when she didn\u2019t message at all it took away the dynamic they had and he felt weird. You really do know how to punch down though. And the way you describe yourself and Lucas (besties, know everything about each other, closer than brothers, etc) vs his wife (she\u2019s very boring, so clingy, everyone is tired of her including her husband, she doesn\u2019t fit in and we don\u2019t want her on group trips) is weird. Feels weird. Why did he marry her if she acts like this or he doesn\u2019t like her lol", "You seem to have excluded May from day 1, and made her feel unwelcome. Your behaviour seems consistent with this assumption- like your comments to her on returning. You have just put your friend in a terrible spot- he is going to have to choose between the two of you real soon. YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019ve effectively alienated your friend from his wife and, more to the point, given her the space to become emotionally alienated from him. But you\u2019ll still have your friend to party with when he\u2019s single again!", "YTA.  You\u2019re clearly very jealous of your friends relationship with his wife.  This manipulation backfired for you, didn\u2019t it?  She didn\u2019t ask to go on the trip you were determined to exclude her from, she didn\u2019t text and guess what?  He missed her! \n\nJokes on you and you are the joke, and the asshole.  Time to grow up.", "YTA - Go back and read your own post. You obviously don't like May and seem eager to exclude her. Well, your friend married her. She's more important to him than you are. He was nervous about his communication routine with her being disrupted even though she just stuck to the agreement and let you guys have a good time. \n\nThat's a good sign you shouldn't make fun of her for it.\n\nIf nothing else, think of it as how people treat their siblings - they can make fun of themselves, big brother can pick on little brother or vice-versa, but big brother will fight anyone else that picks on little brother. \n\nYour friend was on edge and your disposition towards May makes it different than when she pokes fun at herself.", "YTA. She was asked not to text and she didn't and this upsets you somehow? What?", "YTA. All you proved here is that May is actually more chill and mature than all of you. You and your friends sound exhausting. May sounds totally great. So cool, you accomplished proving to your friend that he loves his wife.", "YTA. Everyone else has explained why well, I just wanted you to know another person agrees with them, lol. \n\n(Also, it's totally possible that he's only sometimes annoyed by her texting. It's way different getting spammed by someone who you're going to see again in two hours than it is getting to speak to your wife while you're half the world away. Guy was probably a little homesick and wanted reassurance.)", "You don't know Lucas nearly as well as you think you do. Muting texts doesn't mean you don't love your spouse, being annoyed with your spouse doesn't mean you don't love them. The very fact you took his phone and wouldn't give it back is fucking weird and controlling. Your \"joke\" like the rest of your comments about May are immature and sound jealous.. YTA", "YTA. Damn stop trying to sabotage their marriage.", "YTA. \n\nI wanna know how many of the people in the \u201cfriends group\u201d are wives or partners that were \u201callowed\u201d to join and go on this trip but May wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been the partner that just never fit in with the established group before, and man does it suck.", " What is the point of mentioning that \u201call she did was read books and lounge around the house\u201d? Was she supposed to cry and to be miserable because you purposely excluded her from a trip and then isolated her from her husband? YTA big time\u2026", "YTA  Lucas sounds like someone who was taking his wife for granted and found out that *gasp* he likes talking to his wife and misses her when he's gone. And he seemed to want reassurance that she missed him too. Butt out of their marriage. You sound like a 3rd wheel who is bitter that someone who you're \"closer than brothers\" with found a wife and comes between the two of you.", "oh, YTA. ooof. How would you respond if you were the one reading this about someone else? Yikes.", "YTA. Friend relationships change and all you did was switch his loyalty to her. May won.", "Your friend and his wife had a dynamic going and he felt pressured to change it. His wife did fine. Didn\u2019t call, whatever, while he was craving her contact. There is a lot of distinction here and if I were your friend I would feel like maybe I saw signs I am growing beyond a friend group. And maybe I miss my wife a lot more than I thought I would. And maybe she is done with this stupidity with my friends. Yta.", "YTA, full stop.", "YTA. How long have you been in love with your friend? And how upset are you that turning them against each other isn\u2019t going well for you?", "Clearly Luke missed the texting.\nAnd seems like it bothered OP and the friend group for whatever reason.\nThe wife seems chill due to how she followed the request to not \u201cspam\u201d.\nSometimes spouses may actually want to text and call each other. It\u2019s not unheard of. It just means they genuinely enjoy each others company.\nYTA", "YTA- you and your and whole group. She just wanted to enjoy and you did not accept her as doesn't 'fit' in and that friend is idiot who used to mute the notification and now realised he missed those. People need to understand spouse is important too, more than friends.", "YTA- Lucas doesn\u2019t hate getting all the texts messages from his wife, he just acts like he does around y\u2019all. Probably because you bitched so much about his wife that he felt like he need to go along with it. Clearly the only brothers you\u2019re \u201ccloser\u201d than are the estranged ones. And May has the right to be clingy and monopolize Lucas because he\u2019s her HUSBAND, which you very obviously don\u2019t like.\n\nAnd it\u2019s weird that you are so dead set on making May seem so unfun. You call her boring, and then point out that all she did was read and lounge around as if that\u2019s something bad, and then you say Lucas is sad to be back where it is boring, basically implying that he\u2019s sad to be back with his wife where it\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s almost as if you think you\u2019re better than her.\n\nAnd the fact that you decided she couldn\u2019t come on the vacation because she wasn\u2019t part of The Friend Group as if over all these years you guys haven\u2019t added anyone new in, or no one else has gotten married, is crazy. Are you telling me that absolutely none of your friends were allowed to bring any of their spouses? Or is Lucas the only one of you who has actually managed to find someone else who can put up with him?\n\nHonestly, YTA and so is everyone in your friend group including Lucas. May deserves better than all of you.", "YTA. Lucas gives me the impression that he likes to feel superior based on the context from the post. If he\u2019s getting this bent out of shape because she followed his wishes, he\u2019s got some control issues, Just my take on this.", "YTA. Majorly. You ice out his wife from the friend group, then make it clear you don\u2019t want her on this trip. Are you 27 or 5? Because you and your friend group are acting like a mean girl high school clique. Did you ever stop to think it gets uncomfortable because she knows you don\u2019t like her? So of course she\u2019d want to talk to the one person who actually likes her. If I were Lucas I\u2019d find a new friend group. Not one that acts like a bunch of ahS.", "YTA \n\nWe get it. Your jealous no one is that interested in you", "So, she\u2019s clingy if she does text and negligent if she doesn\u2019t? You kind of suck, dude.", "YTA\u2026 so tell us\u2026 how long have you wanted to bang your best friend because that\u2019s the only explanation I can find for you being so upset that his wife texts her husband \u201call the time\u201d as you put it.", "YTA and you\u2019re a weirdo for having so many issues with your friend\u2019s spouse for basically no reason", "I honestly think that you and your friends group should grow up a little as you\u2019re almost 30 and acting like you are 15.

Not when somene is super rude/abusive and says it was a joke to deflect responsibility. \n\nAs for boring...look in the mirror. Boring is between the ears. \n\nYou sound wildly jealous of your friend and his relationship. Your friend group sounds insufferable. It may be how you describe it, but you seem to go to great lengths to describe how awesome all of you are and how horrible May is. \n\nMaybe your friend is worried you all were so mean to her she didn't want to travel with you anyway and she has found someone that treats her well.", "R u in love with Lucas? Cause u sure as fuck resent May. YTA", "It's abundantly clear that dude loves his wife. Sounds like they love each other so much. They love communicating and being around each other but can handle space too.\n\nYou however, you're a piece of work.

Maybe thats because he realised his friend is honestly just controlling & jealous and he prefers her company after all. Your comments to her were uncalled for, not your place to speak for him, and sound more like a projection of your own feelings. Doesn't sound like the trip was \"a blast\" for him at all.", "I think you\u2019re in love w your friend and I\u2019m denial", "This is all a guess but: It sounds like Lucas was mad because he actually \\_likes\\_ feeling important and being love bombed and clinged to. He asked is she missed him immediately because she didn't contact him at all during the trip. He was annoyed to hear that she just read and hung out because she could have reached out and didn't.

It sounds like May might have an anxious attachment style. That may spring from something else that's happened in her past, or it could be because of something in her and Lucas' dynamic that makes her feel insecure. Either way, not contacting him cold turkey was probably really hard for her, but she did it to prove something to herself (positive) and all of you (which she shouldn't have had to do). On some level she will have been embarrassed that her \"clingyness\" was made such a thing of. She's an actual full human being, not just some annoying slew of notifications on your buddy's phone.", "Dude, you are clueless. He obviously loves his wife\u2019s attention towards him.

Its probably why he mutes texts around you. \n\nHe got increasingly irritated thru the trip bc he missed her so much and you hate to realize how much he missed her and likes the texts. \n\nThe man loves his wife so you should just STFU about her and apologize. \n\nIt\u2019s like you\u2019re annoyed you couldn\u2019t complain about her texting on the trip. But then say your friend was right to be annoyed about not hearing from her so which is it? She\u2019s obviously damned by you either way. \n\nThis is a you problem, not a May problem.", "Regardless of how Lucas feels about the texts, it's up to him to resolve it. You are a busy body who is obssessed with your friend's relationship.\nStop being a rude and nosy AH. YTA", "He made up the rules so he gets to break them. Or as adults see it: wanting to talk to his wife. It wasn't your phone for any intents and purposes. You could have just used your own phone dimwit. \n\nInfo: did you ever share 1 bedroom apartment (and bed)with \"Lucas\"? Or build a special room for him to work on his creative endeavors?", "INFO: are you in love with Lucas and that\u2019s why you\u2019re so jealous of and mean to his wife? (Stg so many of these posts lately, men need to get it together)", "Did u pay for it does it have all ur numbers on it no because it wasn't ur phone he is allowed to snatch his own shit off u", "Grow up. YTA.", "Lucas broke his own rules, but his wife is the one your annoyed with, not your friend.", "Grow the fuck up.", "I don't understand the joke, could you explain it?", "I\u2019m so glad my significant others friend group isn\u2019t a bunch of entitled selfish assholes like yours is", "May's probably making it to try and get some sort of comradeship from you fuckwits. Self depreciation - you should maybe try it some time to take yourself down a notch.", "Not that big of a leap. I was going to comment and ask how long you've been in love with him. So...maybe do some deep soul searching.\n\nEdit: YTA", "So this is post wasn\u2019t leading up to you being secretly in love with him and jealous?", "its true, ur in denial :)", "It\u2019s pretty obvious. Why are you so jealous?", "Bro no one is going to believe that after reading your post, you're the personification of control issues - birds of a feather flock together.", "You clearly do", "I think op thought he was annoyed because she was capable of not being annoying all along, but that's his own projection.  You are correct that he just missed his wife. \n\nAm I the only one who thinks traveling abroad and not contacting your spouse at all is super fucking weird?", "And how would she have known the flight arrived early? Did they break their own texting rule to let her know? Or maybe she muted her notifications from these AH\u2019s so they\u2019d quit being so clingy \ud83d\ude05", "I do! OP hates women and is deeply misogynistic", "Ohhhh yeah!\n\nPick me up so I can bag you out! \n\nThen think \u201cI\u2019m so funny, it\u2019s just a joke\u201d", "hes probably in love with him lmao\n\neither that or he's hella misogynistic and jealous! :D", "No dude, there\u2019s something wrong with Lucas too.", "This.", "Clearly one of those weird people who (checks notes) \"reads books\".\n\nYTA", "Or moreover, he decided to change the game and OP had a tantrum.", "No, but he knows her better than anyone, even her husband!  /s", "Exactly. She used to be in love with her husband and now she\u2019s been pushed away enough that she doesn\u2019t give a flying fuck what he does.", "It absolutely is super fucking weird. Even when my husband goes away for work for a day, we still text a few times to keep each other in the loop. Simple stuff like, \"Got to the hotel safely\" \"Having a fun dinner with so and so! Look at this amazing meal!\" \"Bed time! Love you!\" or even just a row of hearts. That's what normal people who love each other do. \n\nAlso, who goes to another continent for vacation and leaves their spouse at home?? Unless they're doing trips like that all the time, that's incredibly shitty to leave her out of a major adventure like that and worse that they made it explicit that she's not welcome.", "I think it depends on the couple, honestly. My friend and her fianc\u00e9 have been together for 6+ years now, are totally devoted to each other, but I could definitely see them being able to go on trips with low to no contact and be totally fine (we watch criminal minds together and every time someone is asked by an agent \u201cyou haven\u2019t spoken to your spouse in 2-3days??\u201d She always makes the comment that she and her fiance could do that and not think anything of it). Other people not so much. I personally agree with you that not contacting your spouse at all is strange.", "\ud83e\udd23 they expected her to be tracking their flight and promptly leave the house leaving all other \u201cboring\u201d plans like lounging and reading to pick up \u201cgood old\u2019 boys\u201d from a fun adventure she could not go to because she is too boring. \u201cDon\u2019t be boring, but be boring enough to cater for us\u201d", "Yeah you're right on the money. He's a lowlife for letting his little buddies rag on his wife and muting her texts. He should've stood up for his wife the moment op started on, \"oh he had a great time he's just annoyed to be around you again\" comment", "Agree. For some reason, OP wants his homie to be single again.", "Oh I she with that last part. Whatever works for these people, but if we're married, I'd reallllllly prefer we do the multi-thousand dollar trip to a new place together.  Go skiing with your friends or something.  But for whatever reason, that part didn't seem to bother this woman?", "I think every couple of days or as you change location is good- \"hey, we landed\" \"got to the hotel\" \"see you when we land\". Or sending some pictures of very cool things that you're doing.  It doesn't need to be conversational all day, but zero check ins over what I assume is at least a week strikes me as odd.", ">But for whatever reason, that part didn't seem to bother this woman?\n\nEh I wouldn't necessarily be thrilled to be trapped in a foreign place with a group of people who don't like anything about me and try to avoid me and a husband who wants to get away from me so much that he mutes the notifications from my messages either.", "I fully agree with this, my partner is on a business trip right now and our schedules haven't lined up for us to be able to converse but we both send each other little things throughout the day. He'll send the exciting things he gets to do, and I'll send him the little happy self care things I do and random things that made me think of him. When he's on a trip and gets to eat fancy food that's paid for by work I'll treat myself to a fancy cheese as part of a snack dinner. \n\nI would be so bummed not to connect at all over the course of a week. Everyone is different, but I totally agree that OP's friend likes how much his wife texts and he only mutes her cause he's sick of being made fun of. OP is so toxic, let your friend communicate with his wife, she's probably his best friend."]}
