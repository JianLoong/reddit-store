It\u2019s no joke to say that we\u2019re basically closer than brothers. I know everything about him and the same goes for him. We\u2019re part of a friend group that has known each other for years and years.\n\nLucas has a wife, May (28F) who is fine but she\u2019s very serious and can be a bit overbearingingly clingy and boring. She doesn\u2019t really fit in with our friend group. It just devolves into awkward silence and her trying to monopolize Lucas all the time and be really prying. Even Lucas gets tired of her. Plus she texts him literally all the time and he usually has to mute notifications from her. \n\nWe\u2019ve been planning a group trip to hit up Southeast Asia for a while now and we finally got to go. We were worried that May would want to come along so we made it clear that it was just the friend group. We also had a policy where we would try to be as low contact as possible. May agreed to not text/call Lucas at all during our trip and me and Lucas even switched phones so he wouldn\u2019t pick up which May knew about. \n\nThe trip was a blast at first but Lucas started getting weird. He kept asking me if May had contacted him yet and to my surprise she hadn\u2019t at all. He didn\u2019t believe me and snatched it from my hand to check. a couple night he even rummaged through my backpack to check his phone. I shut it down. He got more pissy every day I think because he realized that May was totally capable of not spamming him with messages all this time and just now finally did it. \n\nWhen our trip was over, our flight arrived early but May picked us up from the airport when she said she would arrive instead of coming earlier. Lucas asked her if she missed him and May said \u201cof course I did\u201d. Apparently all she did was read books and lounge around the house. Lucas was understandably annoyed and she realized and asked him what was wrong so I thought I would say something and make my buddy feel better. \n\nI said that Lucas had an awesome time in SEA. He was just annoyed to be back home in boring town. I added that we didn\u2019t realize that she could stop herself from texting so much and that we would\u2019ve gone on the trip sooner if we had known (which was a joke). May said she was happy Lucas had fun and sorry for texting so much before. I thought it was over and settled but Lucas cussed me out later and called me an asshole but she didn\u2019t seem hurt. She even laughed? AITA?\n\nEdit: May made the jokes about herself before too that she texts too much and is like that. \n\nLucas was the one who suggested the \u201cno texting\u201d thing when we brought up our concerns. He also mutes only her texts/notifications not anybody else\u2019s because she spams him so much.\n\nI thought I was making a lighthearted joke", "created_utc": 1677208530, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ah12s/aita_for_talking_about_my_friends_wifes_texting/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He *likes* feeling loved and needed.\n\nHis first question upon return was to check if she missed him.\n\nYou\u2019re projecting your dislike of May onto Lucas, and being rude to both of them in the process.", "You... are not as good at reading people as you think you are. It's obvious that May isn't as clingy as you think she is, that Luke LIKES it when May texts him, it makes him feel missed and he misses her, too, and that you're the immature oddball in your friend group. I'm sure right now they're all saying YTA.", "YTA. What is your problem? Luca clearly loves his wife and was disappointed that she wasn't contacting him. You have some strange problem with May and need to deal with it. You've tried to isolate her from your group and Luca isn't playing. You need to realize you're the problem.", "YTA- You're comment was not a joke and you know it. She probably laughed it off because she was embarrassed. Your friend was right to cuss you out. Obviously your friend doesn't mind her texting, only you.", "YTA.  You say you're closer than brothers, but you've done the following to a person he loves and is committed to:\n1. Exclude her.\n2.  Keep her from communicating with him.\n3. Belittle her after she picked you up from the airport.\n\nI find it very interesting that you keep assuming or intuiting how you think he feels.  But you've never asked him.  And apparently you aren't close enough that he's volunteered how he feels about it. He knows her behavior bothers YOU and so he tries to hide it from YOU but it seems like he actually likes it when she pays attention to him.", "Way too many words to say that OP is in love with his best friend. \n\nOh, and YTA.", "YtA. He married her for a reason. You might know him for long but you're not him. You don't know what he needs to feel loved and taken care off. Let them be.", "YTA and you seem very controlling.   You \"shut down\" someone checking their own phone, and you were incredibly rude to his wife.  Why do you get to decide for them how in contact they are? Its not about you....", "YTA- You are the problem.  Not May.  \n\nIt sounds like Lucas is going along with your tasteless \u201cjokes\u201d to humour you, and is probably at home complaining to May that you don\u2019t stop bitching about her texts.  I\u2019d mute my notifications too if the person I was with whined every time one popped up.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re jealous of Lucas and May\u2019s relationship or just jealous that she takes his attention away from you.  Either way, stop trying to come between your friend and his wife.  He will choose her, and you\u2019ll lose your friend.", "YTA. You were deliberately rude to her, with no provocation. It's none of your business how often she texts her husband.", "YTA for assuming that because someone laughed they couldn't have been offended. \n\n\"I lied and had to laugh\" is a conflict avoidance technique.", "YTA. Yeah I can\u2019t even read the full story, it\u2019s too weird.  I have never heard of a married dude going on a trip to another country and going no contact with his spouse. In addition the fact that you all hate her and act that that\u2019s totally normal is really immature. You\u2019re pretty much all TAs.", "YTA and i had to do a double take that you are 27 good lord", "YTA\n\nI think he enforced the rule because he was annoyed at her obsessive texting, and also because he didn\u2019t want that to ruin your trip as well. But that doesn\u2019t mean he wanted you to speak over him with his wife. Maybe the texting bothers him way more than it bothers you, maybe the texting is comforting to him and he doesn\u2019t *really* mind it much.\n\nIt sounds like he kinda just assumed she couldn\u2019t resist and when she didn\u2019t message at all it took away the dynamic they had and he felt weird. You really do know how to punch down though. And the way you describe yourself and Lucas (besties, know everything about each other, closer than brothers, etc) vs his wife (she\u2019s very boring, so clingy, everyone is tired of her including her husband, she doesn\u2019t fit in and we don\u2019t want her on group trips) is weird. Feels weird. Why did he marry her if she acts like this or he doesn\u2019t like her lol", "You seem to have excluded May from day 1, and made her feel unwelcome. Your behaviour seems consistent with this assumption- like your comments to her on returning. You have just put your friend in a terrible spot- he is going to have to choose between the two of you real soon. YTA.", "YTA. You\u2019ve effectively alienated your friend from his wife and, more to the point, given her the space to become emotionally alienated from him. But you\u2019ll still have your friend to party with when he\u2019s single again!", "YTA.  You\u2019re clearly very jealous of your friends relationship with his wife.  This manipulation backfired for you, didn\u2019t it?  She didn\u2019t ask to go on the trip you were determined to exclude her from, she didn\u2019t text and guess what?  He missed her! \n\nJokes on you and you are the joke, and the asshole.  Time to grow up.", "YTA - Go back and read your own post. You obviously don't like May and seem eager to exclude her. Well, your friend married her. She's more important to him than you are. He was nervous about his communication routine with her being disrupted even though she just stuck to the agreement and let you guys have a good time. \n\nThat's a good sign you shouldn't make fun of her for it.\n\nIf nothing else, think of it as how people treat their siblings - they can make fun of themselves, big brother can pick on little brother or vice-versa, but big brother will fight anyone else that picks on little brother. \n\nYour friend was on edge and your disposition towards May makes it different than when she pokes fun at herself.", "YTA. She was asked not to text and she didn't and this upsets you somehow? What?", "YTA. All you proved here is that May is actually more chill and mature than all of you. You and your friends sound exhausting. May sounds totally great. So cool, you accomplished proving to your friend that he loves his wife.", "YTA. Everyone else has explained why well, I just wanted you to know another person agrees with them, lol. \n\n(Also, it's totally possible that he's only sometimes annoyed by her texting. It's way different getting spammed by someone who you're going to see again in two hours than it is getting to speak to your wife while you're half the world away. Guy was probably a little homesick and wanted reassurance.)", "You don't know Lucas nearly as well as you think you do. Muting texts doesn't mean you don't love your spouse, being annoyed with your spouse doesn't mean you don't love them. The very fact you took his phone and wouldn't give it back is fucking weird and controlling. Your \"joke\" like the rest of your comments about May are immature and sound jealous.. YTA", "YTA. Damn stop trying to sabotage their marriage.", "YTA. \n\nI wanna know how many of the people in the \u201cfriends group\u201d are wives or partners that were \u201callowed\u201d to join and go on this trip but May wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve been the partner that just never fit in with the established group before, and man does it suck.", " What is the point of mentioning that \u201call she did was read books and lounge around the house\u201d? Was she supposed to cry and to be miserable because you purposely excluded her from a trip and then isolated her from her husband? YTA big time\u2026", "YTA  Lucas sounds like someone who was taking his wife for granted and found out that *gasp* he likes talking to his wife and misses her when he's gone. And he seemed to want reassurance that she missed him too. Butt out of their marriage. You sound like a 3rd wheel who is bitter that someone who you're \"closer than brothers\" with found a wife and comes between the two of you.", "oh, YTA. ooof. How would you respond if you were the one reading this about someone else? Yikes.", "YTA. Friend relationships change and all you did was switch his loyalty to her. May won.", "Your friend and his wife had a dynamic going and he felt pressured to change it. His wife did fine. Didn\u2019t call, whatever, while he was craving her contact. There is a lot of distinction here and if I were your friend I would feel like maybe I saw signs I am growing beyond a friend group. And maybe I miss my wife a lot more than I thought I would. And maybe she is done with this stupidity with my friends. Yta.", "YTA, full stop.", "YTA. How long have you been in love with your friend? And how upset are you that turning them against each other isn\u2019t going well for you?", "Clearly Luke missed the texting.\nAnd seems like it bothered OP and the friend group for whatever reason.\nThe wife seems chill due to how she followed the request to not \u201cspam\u201d.\nSometimes spouses may actually want to text and call each other. It\u2019s not unheard of. It just means they genuinely enjoy each others company.\nYTA", "YTA- you and your and whole group. She just wanted to enjoy and you did not accept her as doesn't 'fit' in and that friend is idiot who used to mute the notification and now realised he missed those. People need to understand spouse is important too, more than friends.", "YTA- Lucas doesn\u2019t hate getting all the texts messages from his wife, he just acts like he does around y\u2019all. Probably because you bitched so much about his wife that he felt like he need to go along with it. Clearly the only brothers you\u2019re \u201ccloser\u201d than are the estranged ones. And May has the right to be clingy and monopolize Lucas because he\u2019s her HUSBAND, which you very obviously don\u2019t like.\n\nAnd it\u2019s weird that you are so dead set on making May seem so unfun. You call her boring, and then point out that all she did was read and lounge around as if that\u2019s something bad, and then you say Lucas is sad to be back where it is boring, basically implying that he\u2019s sad to be back with his wife where it\u2019s no fun. It\u2019s almost as if you think you\u2019re better than her.\n\nAnd the fact that you decided she couldn\u2019t come on the vacation because she wasn\u2019t part of The Friend Group as if over all these years you guys haven\u2019t added anyone new in, or no one else has gotten married, is crazy. Are you telling me that absolutely none of your friends were allowed to bring any of their spouses? Or is Lucas the only one of you who has actually managed to find someone else who can put up with him?\n\nHonestly, YTA and so is everyone in your friend group including Lucas. May deserves better than all of you.", "YTA. Lucas gives me the impression that he likes to feel superior based on the context from the post. If he\u2019s getting this bent out of shape because she followed his wishes, he\u2019s got some control issues, Just my take on this.", "YTA. Majorly. You ice out his wife from the friend group, then make it clear you don\u2019t want her on this trip. Are you 27 or 5? Because you and your friend group are acting like a mean girl high school clique. Did you ever stop to think it gets uncomfortable because she knows you don\u2019t like her? So of course she\u2019d want to talk to the one person who actually likes her. If I were Lucas I\u2019d find a new friend group. Not one that acts like a bunch of ahS.", "YTA \n\nWe get it. Your jealous no one is that interested in you", "So, she\u2019s clingy if she does text and negligent if she doesn\u2019t? You kind of suck, dude.", "YTA\u2026 so tell us\u2026 how long have you wanted to bang your best friend because that\u2019s the only explanation I can find for you being so upset that his wife texts her husband \u201call the time\u201d as you put it.", "YTA and you\u2019re a weirdo for having so many issues with your friend\u2019s spouse for basically no reason", "I honestly think that you and your friends group should grow up a little as you\u2019re almost 30 and acting like you are 15.

Boring is between the ears. \n\nYou sound wildly jealous of your friend and his relationship. Your friend group sounds insufferable. It may be how you describe it, but you seem to go to great lengths to describe how awesome all of you are and how horrible May is. \n\nMaybe your friend is worried you all were so mean to her she didn't want to travel with you anyway and she has found someone that treats her well.", "R u in love with Lucas? Cause u sure as fuck resent May. YTA", "It's abundantly clear that dude loves his wife. Sounds like they love each other so much. They love communicating and being around each other but can handle space too.\n\nYou however, you're a piece of work.

Maybe thats because he realised his friend is honestly just controlling & jealous and he prefers her company after all. Your comments to her were uncalled for, not your place to speak for him, and sound more like a projection of your own feelings. Doesn't sound like the trip was \"a blast\" for him at all.", "I think you\u2019re in love w your friend and I\u2019m denial", "This is all a guess but: It sounds like Lucas was mad because he actually \\_likes\\_ feeling important and being love bombed and clinged to. He asked is she missed him immediately because she didn't contact him at all during the trip. He was annoyed to hear that she just read and hung out because she could have reached out and didn't.

It sounds like May might have an anxious attachment style. That may spring from something else that's happened in her past, or it could be because of something in her and Lucas' dynamic that makes her feel insecure. Either way, not contacting him cold turkey was probably really hard for her, but she did it to prove something to herself (positive) and all of you (which she shouldn't have had to do). On some level she will have been embarrassed that her \"clingyness\" was made such a thing of. She's an actual full human being, not just some annoying slew of notifications on your buddy's phone.", "Dude, you are clueless. He obviously loves his wife\u2019s attention towards him.

It probably also makes you wonder why she needs to text him while he is with the friend group when he already spends so much time with her.   \n\n\nHe is still your best friend, but you're both adults now. It's best if you realize that the dynamics of relationships change as you progress through life. He has his own family now. May makes your friend happy, that is why he married her. It's best that you support this relationship and be a better friend.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly obvious that Lucas missed his wife, and was pissy because she *wasn't* texting, because he missed her. He\u2019s being a huge AH to her for your benefit, because you and your friends complain about her and how much she contacts him, but it very clearly doesn\u2019t actually bother him. \n\nAlso, you\u2019re being really cruel to this girl who seems to be nothing but kind to you. Don\u2019t call her boring and don\u2019t be so rude.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re in love with Lucas, and he doesn\u2019t reciprocate your feelings. I\u2019m so sorry he\u2019s leading you on in this way.\n\nPro tip: guys who aren\u2019t in love with their best friend don\u2019t try to alienate their wife, don\u2019t complain/mock the spouse to their friend, don\u2019t belittle someone who is doing them a favor, and don\u2019t care about their buddy getting texts.", "Is your name Nolan and do you have a \"situation\" about your parents dying?", "YTA stop trying to insert your own bullshit into your friends relationship. Mind your own bloody business!", "YTA. Reading this I wonder if Lucas is old enough to be married and if you were all safe to be away without parents", "YTA. My husband had friends like you when I first met him. They mocked him for how much we texted each other. The fact is we loved those texts. We still do. It\u2019s our way to feel close even when we are apart. Your friend loves knowing she can\u2019t stop thinking about him and you are being mean about it. Of course he\u2019s playing along because you won\u2019t leave it alone.", "YTA, you're a lousy friend with a 13-year old's attitude. You should be ashamed how you write about your good friends wife, how shitty can you be?", "Exactly. They made her feel so excluded that she didn\u2019t bother trying to come on the trip. \n\nAnd when she did what they asked of her they still had a go at her!\n\nSooo rude. YTA big time", "You already summarized it very well. \n\nJust one point to add: \n\n>Lucas asked her if she missed him and May said \u201cof course I did\u201d. Apparently all she did was read books and lounge around the house. Lucas was understandably annoyed \n\nI don't even understand this sentence. Why is he \"understandably annoyed\" by that? What did she do wrong? Why is lounging around the house reading books wrong? Or why is it any of OPs or even Lucas' business when they were not even there? Tbh sounds like a great relaxing time she had. I am so confused about all that hostility from OP against May when everything he tells about her seems like she is a sweet and caring person?", "I bet you're right about everything here.   Nailed it. \n\nYTA.", "Could not have put it any better. Great breakdown of this chap's childish actions.", "You nailed it. This guy is making all kinds of assumptions about his friend\u2019s motivations and feelings.", "If he was disappointed why would he suggest the rule of no texting for May in the first place?", "If he liked her texting why would he mute only her texts and make the rule that she can\u2019t contact him? Makes no sense to me. \n\nMay cannot hide her feelings to save her life so I would know if she was offended.", "Yep.  I went there too when I read this.  Pure jealousy!", "that\u2019s a big leap there bud", "He broke the rules he had set up and I was using his phone. For all intensive purposes it was my phone for the trip and he literally just grabbed it out of my hand", "It was just a joke that we make often. Even May makes it sometimes.", "For real, laughing can mean many things from, \"that was funny,\" to, \"how awkward,\" to, \"please don't kill me.\"", "Sometimes a comment is so damn rude or untrue, you laugh at the audacity of it. I suggest Mary was doing that. OP sounds like a Grade-A AH.", "One time I laughed when someone said they went to a friend's funeral. I was really uncomfortable and caught off guard. Luckily it was my close friend who knows I laugh when I am uncomfortable unexpectedly. So he said, it's ok, I know you're not really laughing. Which then made me tear up.\n\nI've laughed at worse.\n\nThe point is that laughing doesn't mean that you're actually funny. Humans are weird and find ways to avoid confrontation. You're right.", "Umm wym emotionally alienated?", "I was thinking the same thing. Lucas may actually be a huge issue. He gets mad and \u201csilences\u201d May\u2019s texts when she contacts him, and he also gets mad and makes a very passive aggressive comment about her missing him when she does not text, just like he asked her not too. Lucas sounds like he is controlling. And OP doesn\u2019t sound much better with comments about Lucas being justified in being annoyed that she did EXACTLY what was asked of her. I am almost worried about May. And to put it out there, I\u2019m not making leaps to try and make things bigger than they are, this is all based on the story OP told.", "Nah he doesn\u2019t have control issues", "I agree about  Lucas but op is the AH based on his whole  description of May .all of it is negative. Also Lucas might have bitten more than he can chew in this case if his wife decided  to disengage permanently  from texting/calling  him after being  ignored/made fun of /insulted as being clingy and giving  him what he whished for.", "I had the same read about Lucas as you.", "I think Lucas was wondering what she did as she wasn't texting him, so it made him concerned/feel jealous that he wasn't the centre of her world", "You pointed correct at one of the things i considered in saying that OP tryed to intervene in their relationship. He knows well that Lucas loves her but he's kind of spineless and will agree to everything OP says or else OP will mock him.\n\nOP is quite good at turning things in his favour, that's why he convinced Lucas to change phones, tell her to not contact him.\n\nMia was wonderful in her aproach. Her heart was broken but she just smiled and accepted her \"punishment\".\n\nI don't know when she came up with this idea, but she deserves standing ovations for responding so calmly to that question: \"did she missed him?\". \"Of course i did\".\n\nShe is the brave one in this story. And she loves her husband. But if he doesn't break up with OP , she will leave. Because she is stronger than everyone thought.\n\nEdit to correct and add:\n\nOp is jealous, that's why he is hostile and doesn't want her in their lives. She is taking Lucas away from OP.", "I was confused by this, too. No idea what OP\u2019s trying to imply.", "Edit to correct\n\nI responded to a different post first \ud83d\ude05.\n\nThat's what it seems to be... IMO", "And what\u2019s wrong with the wife lounging around the house and reading books? She\u2019s living her best life if you ask me! I\u2019d sooner do that than tramp around a continent with OP\u2026", "Because you\u2019re one of those friends who has a weird fixation on how much your buddy\u2019s significant other texts him and he\u2019s placating you. Ask yourself why you need to even comment on how much she texts? Why does it matter to you? If you don\u2019t like it, don\u2019t date someone that texts like her. The fact you make an issue out of it is bizarre and childish. Let them do their thing.", "Why does that matter? He's an adult the second he wanted his phone back you should have given it to him. Get out of his butthole bro.", "To humor you.", "Did he suggest it, or did you manipulate and corner him into suggesting it with a bunch of judgmental leading questions and comments?\n\n\nAlso yeah YTA obviously. Your buddy loves his wife more than you. Get over it.", "We\u2019re you guys never busting his balls about it?\nMy husband acts one way with his friends, and I get a different version.  Most husbands don\u2019t show their friends that version of them. If they do they get shit on.\n\nAnd she\u2019s monopolizing Lukas all the time? Umm she\u2019s his wife lmao. Lucas married her because she\u2019s his number 1. Him reaming you out proved it.", "You made him so uncomfortable about it he gave into peer pressure.", "Maybe because you always comment on it. Obviously he doesn't mind her texting or he wouldn't have been upset.", "YTA and your comments keep on digging that hole. Stop putting May down. She is his wife so she is allowed to message him. She can make jokes about her habits, but you were just mean from the time you jumped in the car by not allowing your friend to even talk to her to the asshole joke you made. You complaining about her is a you issue and obviously he loves her even when she is annoying. You are just going to ruin your friendship over trying to be a smart as even though you are just an ass.", "It's the only logical leap, otherwise why are you so weird?", "If you aren\u2019t in love with him, your behavior is weirder.", "Yta and no it was a tiny little obvious hop into the real issue. You're jealous bc you want him to yourself. Youre the weird clingy obsessive one. Married people having a close relationship and keeping in contact with each other is normal, you're behavior is not.", "Intents and purposes. Not intensive purposes.  You're welcome.  O and YTA", "It was his phone. His.", "it\u2019s intents and purposes, fyi, \n\nnot intensive purposes.\n\nand also YTA, it always was his phone.", "Intensive purposes? \ud83e\udd23 \n\nLet me ask you this: was anyone else\u2019s SO excluded from this trip? Or just Lucas\u2019s?\n\nHas it occurred to any of you that May seems clingy because she\u2019s being excluded from instead of welcomed into your group? \n\nI have a feeling there\u2019s more to this than you\u2019re saying, but either way, yes. YTA.", "That's a very flimsy excuse,  you don't get to decide for someone else who they have contact with,  period.  You just wanted to control who he was speaking to because you don't like her.", "Intents and purposes.  Double asshole!", "And he changed his mind. A mature, rational adult would respect that.", "*intents*", "Yeah he decided to \"break the rules.\" What's the big deal about it *to you*?", "Are you May?", "It isn\u2019t a joke as you keep stating in the post that she is clingy and texts/calls all the time.", "You don't get to make 'jokes' that could be perceived as amiable ribbing between *friends* about someone you openly dislike and expect everyone to pretend it's good-natured.", "It doesn't sound like Lucas found it funny.", "Hahaha what an amazing joke!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're so hilarious. OMG!!! Tell it again!!! And again. And again.\n\nSigh...", "Thats worse actually.", "I think they mean something about how couples tend to be close and like texting all the time in the beginning stages, and that keeps them close and in love. for some couples, that changing can lead to a gradual distance that can hurt the marriage and lead to separation. BC you pushed for your friends wife to break the pattern \\*her and her husband\\* established \\*together\\* of always texting, there may be separation and emotional alienation that is longer lasting that comes from this. She may realize she likes being alone more and doing her own thing more, where as her husband/your friend seems to have realized he likes her doting on him all the time.   \n\n\nThat incompatibility could lead to issues with their marriage.", "Why are you here if you\u2019re just going to argue with everyone in your comments?", "I think OP added that detail to show how *boring* the wife is. Seems to be the only thing he applies to her, aside from her also being overly clingy in his opinion. Along with the boring wife, he even told her Lucas is annoyed to be back in boring town. \ud83e\udd14", "Thank you I cannot believe a grown man is behaving like this. the delusion of it all", "While of course that\u2019s the correct saying, Idk OP was rather \u2018purposely\u2019 trying really \u2018intensely\u2019 to keep Lucas out of touch with May", "Seems like that was the OP\u2019s entire goal.", "To get someone on his side. Not going well.", "To clarify stuff", "It sure isn\u2019t!", "you\u2019re not clarifying anything - you\u2019re deflecting", "All that you\u2019re clarifying is that yes, you are very much the AH."]}
