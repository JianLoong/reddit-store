I told my friends that in Brasil this would be looked down upon and that I didn\u2019t know a single person who paid rent to their parents. I have three grown sisters who live \u201cat home\u201d and no one pays a cent. I finished my speech saying that it\u2019s fine if they disagree with me, but I personally would never charge my children rent if I wasn\u2019t struggling.\n\nMy friend Amy (27F) said that someone from a third world country wouldn\u2019t understand (?!?) and that my sisters shouldn\u2019t freeload. I told her it wasn\u2019t like that, my parents love to have them around and that it\u2019s common, if not expected, to live with your parents until you get married/find a long time partner. Amy replied by saying that my culture is backwards. I tried to not get offended over her choice of words and said \u201cagree to disagree\u201d.\n\nBack to the present:\nI hosted again last night and told my friends that my older sister is engaged. Amy proceeds to ask if she\u2019s finally going to grow up now, or if mommy and daddy will pay rent for her elsewhere.  \n\nI was sick of her little comments (not the only thing she said this past weeks) and said that no, my sister is buying her own condo with my brother-in-law, and that maybe she could do the same soon if her parents didn\u2019t charge her $1000 + utilities every month. \n\nThis erupted into a fight and dinner was cut short.

Amy is out of line calling things \"backwards\" - it's different, that's all.   I think Amy should apologize to you.\n\nEdit:  Need to add that you didn't humiliate her.  Her behaviour was waaay out of line.  She speaks like this, she needs to learn to take it when it comes back to her.", "She called Brazil a third world country??? What an idiot.", "NTA- she showed a lack of respect towards your culture, you were respectful but once she continued the argument you stood up for yourself. I am in the uk a lot of people had to go back to live with parents it's 50/50 on who pays rent to parents here. a lot of parents just love having the kids back and the ones who do have to pay rent is so they can keep a roof over them. she was being rude, you are fine to stand up for yourself.", "NTA. She was an ignorant xenophobic dick to you and deserved worse than your mild pushback. She\u2019s not your friend and neither is anyone who doesn\u2019t see how out of line she was.", "NTA\n\nAmy was downright rude to you, and belittled your culture. That was wrong. Your response was perfect, given that Amy has been rude about your culture on more than one occasion.\n\nAmy is the one who needs to apologise, not you.", "NTA\n\nAmy sounds like an *awful* person. Like, genuinely racist and classist. You should not waste a moment's thought on her. I also have to question your friends who want you to apologize; did they not hear what she said?!", "NTA you already were the bigger person from the first encounter, She was making some very ignorant comments and then made some more. Why are your friends more concerned with you apologizing? What were they doing when she made those comments?", "NTA. You didn't humiliate her, but she sure as hell tried to humiliate you, your sisters, and your entire culture.\n\nAs a Brazilian, I will never understand why Americans think it's so bizarre to live with family after turning 18. I don't get why splitting the bills with strangers makes you more of an adult than splitting the bills with your parents. And during a housing crisis, too!\n\nIt doesn't make financial sense to me, tbh, but it doesn't *have to*. All I have to do is respect that different cultures work in different ways, a basic manners lesson your friend has yet to learn. And that is putting it mildly, bc the truth is that her comments were extremely xenophobic.", "NTA\n\nI was shocked when I discovered, a few years ago, that in some places that is a common practice. \n\nIt is definitely not a thing, in my country, to charge your kids rent, regardless of their age or employment status. \n\nShe was disrepectful of your country and culture.", "NTA Amy is the one who should be apologizing, any \u201cfriends\u201c who say you should do it keep the peace don\u2019t care about right or wrong, they only care about convenience", "lol WTF, clearly NTA.

You made a sly comment at her expense, but only after she's made several - quite frankly racist - comments about you and your family.", "NTA. Amy is ignorant and is unaware that not every place in the world is like the soccer Mom suburb that she grew up in. At the next party ask her to point out Brazil on a map.", "NTA. Not only did you not really humiliate her, but she was being super insensitive and rude. To say you come from a third world country and that your culture is backwards comes off as racist/xenophobic. Why are you even with a friend that doesn't respect you?", "NTA: Nah, fuck that bigoted racist.", "Hahah Queen \u2026. NTA of course \u2026I don\u2019t know anyone in my country (Germany) who would ask their kids to pay rent.", "NTA. Why do you keep Amy around if she disrespects your race and culture? _Ela que se foda._", "Nah, dont apologize, you are NTA. You prolly should have been more carefull in your choice of words the first time but she goes after your culture and your family wtf is that. I also dont think you should live with your parents until you are married but i would have no issues marrying such a woman. Deff they the A\\*\\* , also if you gonna pay 1k rent to your parents just move away and rent another place so you can have freedom atleast", "NTA you\u2019re better than me because i wouldn\u2019t have let it slide the first time", "NTA.

Nope, you\u2019re not in the wrong. You don\u2019t owe her an apology, quite the opposite. And why haven\u2019t these \u201cfriends\u201d shut her down for not \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d? Anyone agreeing with her are also TA, and frankly, I wouldn\u2019t have any of them back until apologies are issued. Sincere apologies.", "NTA. But why are you friends with someone who belittles you and your country of origin?", "NTA\n\nAnd I apologize on behalf of Americans. There are more ignorant \"Amy's\" in the USA than we'd like to admit, but a good number of us understand that the world is a LOT bigger than us.", "Not in the wrong. NTA", "INFO at any point did you talk to Amy or any other friends about Amy's racist views? Did anyone ever make an attempt to try to correct her after the initial dinner?", "NTA and your friend is annoying. I wouldn\u2019t hang with her anymore if I was you", "NTA...it is a different standard in Brazil and your American friends shouldn't judge on the norms in your country. I know several European countries and prob more SA countries have the same norms. Amy is the AH for making snide comments about society norms that have NO affect on her life.", "NTA. You know that Amy isn\u2019t a friend though, right? Friends don\u2019t make comments like that. She is nasty, toxic and sounds completely racist.", "NTA,  and I question any \"friend\" who's telling you to \"keep the peace.\" Amy has been openly awful to you.  IN YOUR HOME.\n\nFuck \"keeping the peace.\" I wouldn't only NOT apologize,  I'd never invite her back", "NTA\n\nAmy is not your friend, she is racist and jealous", "NTA.\n\nI come from a culture that has the same values, if I have kids I wouldn't be charging them rent if they stay over. Usually the mortgage is paid off by the time they're adults and you're only paying bills and groceries.\n\nInstead of respecting the fact that different cultures do things differently, she went and insulted yours. It's so wrong.", "NTA.  She's not your friend.  She used her insecurities to put your culture down.  Anyone else on her side isn't a friend either.  Everything she said was out of line.  I'd think about losing contact with her.  Bigots should be called out.", "NTA for obvious reasons\n\nFurthermore, the USA is definitely an outlier regarding kids and rent.", "What in the racist hell!?!? Amy is an AH and your friends seem pretty lame if they don\u2019t recognize how horrible Amy\u2019s rhetoric and behavior are and asking you to apologize.", "NTA. It is a cultural difference for my family too. (We are Indian) We have two sisters who still live with my parents and don\u2019t pay rent. Even if your friend doesn\u2019t understand it, she doesn\u2019t need to be disrespectful towards you and your family. I applaud you for standing up for your sister.", "NTA. your \u201cfriend\u201d needs to learn that different cultures have different expectations. actually children living at home until they married was once the cultural norm in america as well - and not that long ago. However, it was expected that in middle class or working class families adult children would\nwork and would contribute to the family budget. Few middle class or working class people in the US have homes that are fully paid for until retirement age, if then. in some countries I am told that houses remain in the family and are continuously occupied by family\nmembers sometimes for a very long time. at that point, they are likely fully paid for other than taxes, so maybe it\u2019s easier to get along without the adult children\u2019s financial help.", "NTA, Amy is the AH for making those kinds of comments about your culture and your other friends are AH for letting those comments slide and saying you should apologize. \n\nJust because cultures differ doesn't make it backwards and where you're from doesn't make your opinions mean any less.\n\nAmy continued to be rude and pick in your family. She deserved it imo. She's not your friend.", "ESH \n\nShe had it coming and kind of deserved what you gave her but I don't know that you really accomplished much other than feeling like you got a moral victory. You didn't have to bring Amy into the conversation when you were explaining how your sister had been able to save up money to purchase a condo because she's been living rent-free.\n\n You also probably could have better explain how Brazil is not a third world country and you also could have talked about the United States' unhealthy obsession with nuclear families and how much everyone benefits when multi-generational families live together. \n\nAgain, she deserved it but you lowered yourself to her level.", "it is pretty normal to pay rent to your parents past 18. not american but dutch, but not paying anything is concidered odd, since it put all the economic burden on the parents, and does nothing to help people prepare for the futere situation if they can just spend 100% on there income on whatever. \n\nThe children should life rent free usualy comes with children should finacialy pay for their parents as soon as the are older, so trade off can be off. can cause them to barely have retirment off their own (all generations) and expect the children to solve it. paying 1/3 off your income as rent and everyone does his/her/whatever best to be independent sound as a more futere proof methode to me.", "ESH she's a bigot and you shouldn't be friends with her, but you shouldn't stoop to her level.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a friend who lived with her mom well into her 20s and helped paid the bills because her parents were divorced and then when she bought a house, she made sure to have a separate space so her mom could still live with her. My mom charged me $300 and took $100 for bills and put the rest away and gave it back to me for a security deposit when I moved out.

Even in cases where young adults move away for college (think maybe someone from a small village moving to a capital city, or idk, when I was a teen, I wanted to study something that was only available in Balseiro, in Bariloche), parents usually help them out. Like you said, it's not like you turn 18 and suddenly become an adult with your whole life figured out. Starter jobs don't usually pay very well. We move out when we are financially stable, are in a long-term relationship or get married. Parents here typically do not have that mentality of \"this is my house and you're just a guest here\" either. Anyways, yeah, huge cultural difference.

We all cooked, cleaned, and since I also worked, I helped with bills as I could (not because my mom would ask me, she would never, but because I wanted to).  \nOverall, I think brazilian families are just warm, and I only realized that after reading many posts here...

He pays us $300 a month. This includes all utilities and meals. He is responsible for his pets needs as he has a cat and a dog. If he wants snacks other than what my husband and I provide he has to buy them. He has to buy his own toiletries. He uses the same shampoo as the entire family so he doesn't buy that. He doesn't have a driver's license so I have to drive him to work and pick him up. He is an adult and if he wants to be treated as such, then he does what most other adults do and that's pay rent.
