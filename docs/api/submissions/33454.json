I fly economy, but on long flights I usually splurge and pay the extra ~$20 to reserve my seat. I booked an aisle seat. \n\nIt\u2019s a 737 with six seats per row \u2014 three seats in either side of the aisle. My row was full except for the middle seats. Only the two middle seats were empty. \n\nI\u2019m minding my own business, already closing my eyes as people finished boarding, when I felt a tap on my leg. A kind looking lady said, \u201cexcuse me, I\u2019m so sorry, but my husband is in the seat next to you, and I\u2019m over there,\u201d gesturing to the middle seat on the other side of the aisle. \n\n\u201cWould you mind trading seats with me so I can sit next to my husband?\u201d\n\nMaking the situation more complex, her husband, standing behind her, was holding a baby. Probably 6-12 months old. Very young baby. So now I feel like the gentlemanly thing to do is give up my seat. \n\nMy knee jerk response is thinking out loud. I said, \u201cah that\u2019s a bummer. I did pay for this seat.\u201d I was still considering giving up my seat, but telling her why I was hesitant. \n\nThen, immediately, the husband pipes up loudly: \u201cis anyone on this row willing to give up their seat?\u201d \n\nHe sounded like he was already pissed. He\u2019s looking around at the three other people on my row. \n\nWithout giving us much time to think or respond, he then looks at me and says, \u201cokay, I\u2019m sitting next to you.\u201d\n\nHe aggressively shoves and elbows his way over me, and sits down in the seat next to me. The wife situates herself in the other seat with the baby. \n\nI then said, \u201cI\u2019ll be happy to pass your baby over,\u201d to which he responds, \u201cyeah, that\u2019s not happening.\u201d\n\nNow I\u2019m just getting a bad vibe from the guy, but I kept going. I said \u201cwere you not able to get two seats next to each other?\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cno, they wouldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nI knew there were adjacent seats available when I booked my ticket, so I said, \u201cdid you just plan too late?\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s really pissed. He turns his head toward me, gives me a death glare and says, \u201cno.\u201d\n\nOf course, my natural next question was, \u201cif you didn\u2019t plan too late, why weren\u2019t you able to book two seats next to each other?\u201d But I didn\u2019t ask that. He was already looking murderous by that point, and I was enjoying my podcast. \n\nFortunately, a kind young man in the opposite window seat offered to trade seats with the dad, so I wasn\u2019t stuck sitting next to this stressed and angry father for the rest of the flight. \n\nI\u2019m sure he was just having a stressful travel day, but I ask you honestly, AITA?\n\nTLDR: young mom and dad flying with a baby asked me to trade my aisle seat for a middle seat, and I declined.

I bought flights recently for my son and myself. It would have been awesome to save $200 by going with the basic economy but I did 5 min of reading policies and saw that the airline can\u2019t commit to seating families together regardless of how young the children are. \n\nYou can\u2019t cheap out on stuff like this when you\u2019re responsible for a young child. You have to ask, \u201cwhat\u2019s the catch and is it going to harm my child?\u201d That\u2019s literally the gig with parenting. \n\nExternalizing his humiliation onto you is poor emotional regulation.

It would be gentlemanly, sure, but this is \"Am I The Asshole\" not \"Am I The Gentleman.\" Maybe you're not the gentleman, but I also don't think youre the asshole.", "NTA. Traveling is tough but there\u2019s no obligation to give up seating unless you\u2019re asked by an attendant, and you did pay for the seat. Tbh though I would\u2019ve because I have no desire to sit next to a baby. The couple wasn\u2019t unreasonable in asking but the dad\u2019s following behavior was uncalled for.", "NTA. Nobody will ever be TA for declining to switch to a worse seat, irrespective of the reason.", "NTA - He obviously didn't plan properly and figured he could bully someone (you) to give up their seat.  You proved him wrong, so sad for him.  But dem be the breaks.", "NTA. \n\nYou want to make sure that you sit together? You buy seats. Plain and simple. \n\nIf you don't buy seats, you run the risk of not sitting together. So the only people they should be upset at is each other. \n\nIt's one thing if it's an airline that doesn't allow seat assignments and it's FCFS but that isn't the case here. \n\nI have a weak bladder and you couldn't pay me to sit anywhere but the aisle. Even if you gave me $1000 cash, I wouldn't because I'd piss off my seat mate having to go very frequently. \n\nWould it have been nice if you could swap? Sure. But not swapping doesn't make you an AH.", "NTA. I would out-petty that mfer and try bait him into getting kicked off.", "Seriously, they didn't plan very well. Not your problem. They can survive 6 hours without sitting next to each other.", "NTA", "As I typed this up and re-read your post, I went from e s h to YTA.\n\nYou were n t a for not giving up your seat. But since you knew the dad was \"already pissed\" why did you further goad him w/your questions? \n\n\"Were you not able to get 2 seats next to each other?\" Obviously they weren't able to or they would've been sitting together.

Everybody knows you don\u2019t ask for a swap that\u2019s a downgrade for the other person.", "Thank you! I perhaps could have been more selfless, but I bet he will not make the same mistake again.", "The second diagram is how it was. Well said, I think it may be two different standards and it makes me wonder which I really want to hold myself to.", "LOL on suggestion for new Reddit group. I'd love to see a debate over who is the most mannerly person in the story. Especially given the tone of many of these stories in A I T H.", "I agree with this take. I couldn\u2019t help myself after he started raising his voice and shoving past me. I thought he deserved a little goading. The guy was acting like a bully, and I don\u2019t respond kindly to that. Shame, because his wife was sweet as could be. \n\nThe thing is \u2014 he was clearly lying. If he\u2019d planned early like he said he did, he would\u2019ve been able to get two seats together. I think he was trying to cover up the fact that he didn\u2019t want to pay to reserve seats.", "Yeah I\u2019m not gonna lie, once the dad started raising his voice, I wanted to call him on his BS. Part of me wishes I\u2019d kept pushing the issue, but I love babies and I have a lot of sympathy for parents on planes. \n\nIf something had happened suddenly, he shouldn\u2019t have lied about it when I asked about him making last-minute plans.", "If I were in that situation I probably would have switched, if only because if I'm on a plane with a baby, I want that baby to be as happy as possible lol. But, I'm pretty short, so a middle seat isn't a huge deal to me. I do wonder why the dad couldn't switch to the middle seat beside his wife, if that one was open. Why would they need to both be in aisle seats across from each other? \nYou might be kind of TA for asking him questions when he was obviously irritated, but I can totally imagine myself spitting out the wrong words in that kind ot uncomfortable situation too.", "How do you know for sure that was a lie? On a trip this year, I booked my aisle seats well in advance. When it came time to check in, they moved me to a window seat on the first flight. Why? I wondered if it was a ploy to get me to pay for an upgrade (which worked).\n\nI gave you a YTA for the same reason as widefeet. If you knew the guy was upset, why in the world goad him into making him angrier? Made no sense to me.", "Appreciate the perspective! The two open seats (the middle seats) were theirs. So there was no open seat next to his wife. I agree with you. After he raised his voice and got aggressive, I felt compelled to give him a little bit of the same energy. If I was more enlightened I would have let it go and let him stew. \n\nI feel like my Mom would be disappointed that I didn\u2019t give up my seat."]}
