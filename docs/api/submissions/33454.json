As we used to say in the aerospace industry, \"The lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine.\"  That includes the airline messing up through misconnects, lost reservations, etc.; your problem is with the airline, not with me, and I have no interest in doing an airline an uncompensated favor.\n\nHOWEVER . . .

A sudden illness or death in the family, financial issues that need to be dealt with\u2026leading to, some immediate family legal business.
