{"id": 18674, "submission_id": "13x6cnh", "title": "WIBTA for telling my ex-MIL that her son kept a present she asked him to give to me?", "selftext": "The background: My ex and I divorced about 13 years ago. I have remained friendly with his mother since she\u2019s my son\u2019s grandmother and she has always been kind to me.  My ex and I generally get along with occasional conflicts. I try to \u201ctake the high road\u201d and I\u2019ve let many things slide.  He remarried about 10 years ago and frankly his wife hates me.  I just try to avoid her and be business-like when we must communicate. I am NOT a confrontational type person.\n\nNow the story: My son (a teenager) asked me recently if I\u2019d gotten a Mother\u2019s Day gift from \u201cMama\u201d (what he calls his grandmother).  I said no and he replied, \u201cI knew it!  I heard them talking and they weren\u2019t going to give it to you.  (stepmom) said she doesn\u2019t understand why Mama would STILL be giving you gifts.\u201d \n\nSo, apparently she sent a gift via her son and they decided not to pass it along.  (It was almost certainly a red envelope with some cash as that what she normally would give.)\n\nThe main things I\u2019m angry about are how disrespectful this is to his mother, and that she probably thinks I\u2019m ungrateful for not thanking her.  I hope this has never happened before. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of talking to her directly and asking if it\u2019s true.  If my son is mistaken, he should know so he doesn\u2019t think so badly of his dad. But if it\u2019s true, which I\u2019m inclined to believe, I might be stirring up family drama. \n\nSo, WIBTA for talking to her first?", "created_utc": 1685588218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x6cnh/wibta_for_telling_my_exmil_that_her_son_kept_a/", "score": 1213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019ll also let her know that if she wants to give you a gift, she can\u2019t trust her son as an intermediary. NTA", "I\u2019d ask your MIL, and I\u2019d likely do it like this \u201cson asked if I got your Mother\u2019s Day gift and I wanted to check in with you because it didn\u2019t come in the mail. I always appreciate how thoughtful you are and would hate to not have said thank you.\u201d \n\nIt doesn\u2019t throw your ex under the bus and give your ex-MIL a chance to handle it how she sees fit.", "NTA. If your son is right, your ex and his wife stole money from your former MIL after presumably having agreed to pass it on (after all, ex-MIL wouldn\u2019t have given it to them if they said \u2018no, we refuse to hand anything to that woman). Also, why should your relationship with ex-MIL possibly suffer through you seeming ungrateful for a gift she believes you received?", "\"Hi MIL. I have kind of an odd question for you...did you try to give me a present recently? Obviously, you have no obligation to do something like that, but if you did, I wanted you to know that I didn't get it so you can look into whatever shipping method you used. If you didn't, absolutely no worries--the only reason I'm even asking is that Son was confused by something he thought he overheard, and I wanted to double-check.\"\n\nNTA...and honestly, asking your MIL is really your only option since there's no way you can ask your ex anything about it without it being some kind of accusation. \n\nI know your son *thinks* he knows what his dad and stepmom were talking about (and it certainly sounds plausible), but they could have been speaking hypothetically or discussing the fact that your MIL asked them and they told her they didn't want to be go-betweens (so MIL had to figure out another way of getting it to you and she hasn't gotten around to it yet) or any of a number of other scenarios where they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAnd the truth is, you don't know enough about what may or may not have happened to make an accusation, so if you *did* make an accusation, you *would* be stirring up family drama. But getting clarity on something in a completely non-accusatory way? The only way that can stir up family drama is if your ex is deliberately lying to his mother... And if he is, she deserves a chance to find that out for herself before he abuses her trust in a more significant way.", "NTA\n\nIt's great that you and her still get along but I believe if she wants you to have gifts she needs to give them to you herself, or at the very least give them to your son. Her son and daughter-in- law don't need to know anything about it. It's none of their business and she kind of makes it their business when she gives it to them.", "NTA. I would bring it up cautiously to your ex MIL so it\u2019s not accusatory towards your ex. Calling and saying \u201cSon claims to have overheard something and I had to ask- did you get me a mothers day gift by chance?\u201d And saying you haven\u2019t received it, but look forward to it. \u201cSon is worried that it won\u2019t get to me, but I\u2019m sure it will- ex is probably just forgetful.\u201d This kind of conversation sets up a dialogue to not make an issue of this event but to be suspicious in the future and might cause MIL to talk to ex about it to make sure he remembers to give you the gift.", "NTA", "NTA     just say, I'm a bit confused, grandson said something to me about about his father keeping a gift from you for me. I think he must have heard wrong, but just wanted to check with you.\n\nIt will come across as concern for your son, rather than an accusation against your ex.", "NTA.\n\nI agree that you should ask but I think you should ask your ex MIL. I'd bypass your ex husband altogether as he seems like he's massively under the thumb from the new wife and he'd probably lie to you. It's not being nasty it's trying to get to the truth. If your ex MIL has given her son a gift to give to you then that's what should happen. \n\nSeems like this new wife is having way too much involvement in situations that don't concern her. She shouldn't be hindering a good relationship between you and your ex MIL or your ex husband. She needs to keep her nose out of business that doesn't concern her.", "You: \u201cHey  ExHubby, I need to write your mother a thank you note. Could you tell me how much was in that present she asked you to give me?\u201d", "Sorry that your ex\u2019s wife is not very nice. You should contact your ex-husband and ask him about the gift to clear things up; maybe your son misunderstood or there is a gift.  If there is a gift, make sure to send a text and follow up with a thank you card in the mail. This will help your mil know if you receive any future gifts from her without having to ask her outright", "NTA, take her out for coffee and let her know your concerns in this matter.  Before you meet try to remember the gifts you have received and review them with her.  You said that it might be cash. How often have they taken part of the cash?  She needs to know what they are doing.  This is stealing from her and you.  If they are as bold to take this, it will escalate into taking other things from her as she gets older.", "NTA i kinda want an update so please let us know when you ask her lol", "She's probably been doing it every year. NTA", "NTA... let her k ow, otherwise she will wonder why you never aknowledge the gifts.", "NTA. But I\u2019m going to go out on a ledge here and gently suggest that your motives are not quite as altruistic as you portray. I don\u2019t blame you one bit; I would be pissed too. \n\nTake a step back and consider what the possible outcomes might be. In particular, consider the conflict that may fall on your son\u2019s shoulders, for ratting his father and stepmother out. \n\nI would suggest writing down all the options you see before you and mapping out the likely outcomes before you make your final decision.", "I agree with the commenters about reaching out directly to MIL but please make sure that she knows (once clarified) to try not to accidentally throw your son under the bus with his Dad and step mum, it sounds like Step mum can be vengeful and we don't want her retaliating against your son in anyway.", "Info : why have you been taking the \"high road, let it slide\" with your ex, when he obviously hasn't ? He disrespects you, and his now wife as issues with you, which is completely unreasonable.", "Diplomacy at its best.", "Perfect wording. NTA, OP. This is a very nice was of raising the subject", "This is the way.", "NTA - but you might be if you say nothing.      \nYou say not thanking your MIL might affect your relationship.         \nI\u2019d be more worried it would hurt her feelings.", ">Not acknowledging the gift may be hurting your relationship with your ex MIL and harming how she views you\n\nWhich may be part of the new wife\u2019s evil plan. Definitely NTA.", "Why not? Not everyone wants to insert their child into the middle of a load of unnecessary drama.", "Playing devils advocate- if she didn\u2019t send anything that statement comes accross as passive aggressive, like OP expects something every year.\n\nEdit- re read the statement and take back my comment, think I initially missed the line that said \u201cson asked if I got your md gift\u201d whoops", "Tell her. They're stealing from her and you.", "NTA. Call your MIL. This may have been going on for the last 10 years. She needs to know her son allowed her new DIL to steal your gifts.", "NTA", "NTA How many of these envelopes do you want them to confiscate?", "NTA. Direct communication is always best.", "NTA your ex-husband and his wife are in the wrong for keeping that from you especially since that\u2019s from his mum to you I think that you should confront his mother just to tell her that you never received anything just so she won\u2019t think badly of you. but just to make sure you should talk about this to your ex-husband to see this is true.", "I definitely agree with this. This also saves face for you if there was some misunderstanding which is always possible. Is it really likely she would have sent you cash through her son to her grandson if you remain close? Wouldn\u2019t she have given it herself or mailed it? Maybe not, but my point is things may not be what they seem. Of course they may be exactly as they seem and your ex is TA and your ex MIL doesn\u2019t realize this hand to hand delivery is failed before it starts. NTA if you go this diplomatic route.", "This is perfect! You're not accusing, but if it is true, MIL will know exactly what happened and who to go to.", "It also has the added benefit of being the truth, double win!", "I think that's pretty well covered by the context the question had. If she didn't send anything, it will also sound like miscommunication or a misunderstanding.", "NTA. Plus your son is involved, so not telling anything would prove him it's okay to be disrespected and let anyone step on you (and him as a model).  \nThe grandmother has to know also, then she could know what best to do.  \nDont bother involve your ex and wife.", "Definitely talk to her! Say that your son told you about a Mother\u2019s Day gift, and you didn\u2019t get it but you didn\u2019t want her to think you\u2019re rude so you letting her know. \nThey stole your gift and it could harm your relationship", "NO! NOT THE ASSHOLE. There was obviously something resentful still going on in his mind for him not to pass it along, so instead of tippung him off and giving him a chance to deject, tell his mom and have it coming at him from both sides, and bring in your son with evidence.", "NTA they are stealing from you and you need to sort it out.", "NTA \n\nTell his mommy. This is fucked", "NTA. Ask politely. Otherwise she will think you\u2019re ungrateful.", "NTA ask your MIL before you cause drama with your ex and his partner though", "This is the way!", "Yep, NTA since you\u2019ve mostly kept the relationship with MIL because of her relationship with your son. If you do it tactfully, and mention that your son said MIL had asked about it, I think it\u2019s a way to keep that relationship healthy.", "No because \"son said\" kind of covers that part.", "Talk to her.  You are both close enough for this conversation and if she sent you a gift and you usually thank her, then this might cause you both problems.  Let her know your son told you this and if it's a mistake then you need to let him know to avoid bad feelings with his father and stepmom.  NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit:  his instead of her", "Omg I want an update. NTA", "NTA as you said they are showing  a lack of respect for his mother's wishes too.", "Her?  The grandma or the new wife?", "NTA.  Talk your your ex-MIL. Like you mentioned, she might think you're ungrateful and you don't strike me as that type of person.\n\nNo matter what is in the gift, keeping it instead of passing it on as they led your ex-MIL to believe is *stealing*.\n\nI agree with the earlier commenter's approach of \" \u201cson asked if I got your Mother\u2019s Day gift and I wanted to check in with you because it didn\u2019t come in the mail.\"  Sorry you are going through this.", "NTA. They stole from you and your former MiL, and she should know about it.", "Talking to the MIL is EXACTLY the first thing to do here. NTA.\n\nOf course politely, and without any badmouthing as she\u2019ll need to draw her own conclusions on that front.", "NTA, that's the normal response to have", "NTA and please update when you talk to the grandma, I'm so curious.", "This is a good way to handle it! I hope to see an update", "This is the way.", "NTA. You don't know for sure what happened, and the way to find out is to ask her. You definitely don't want her to think you're being rude, and it gives you a chance to do the right thing.", "NTA I\u2019d be asking and making it clear they are stealing from you both she needs to know this", "NTA. Talk to her and make sure she knows that if she wants you to receive something, she needs to mail it.", "NTA. And agree with the first comment.", "NTA", "NTA you absolutely need to talk to the ex MIL.", "Update us please", "Hi - you\u2019re right, of course, that I should be standing up for myself more often, but it\u2019s not easy for me, in general, and I do worry that they will drag my son into it because they can\u2019t seem to avoid discussing things right out where he can hear.", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re getting downvoted because you have a very valid point.  If I pursue this, they will know my son told me about it, and that could certainly bring heat down on him. I\u2019m going to talk to him before I do anything. \n\nThey\u2019ve gotten away with a lot of stuff this way because I don\u2019t want to cause trouble for my son.", "A red envelope of cash suggests that ex's family is Chinese.

I just wanted to know there is no mistake because I would not want you to think I was ungrateful\".*", "There is no such thing as pot-stirring if it has to do with a thief, imo.

He's old enough to be exposed to this.  He's not 5.  NTA", "I know this will be a super unpopular opinion, but I would leave it alone. It\u2019s such a rare thing to have a semblance of peace in a family situation like yours. It\u2019s something precious that should be protected at all costs. It\u2019s VERY fragile\u2026as reflected by the stolen gift. This is something that doesn\u2019t ultimately affect your life much. It\u2019s just rude and annoying.

This has been my overriding principle for 13 years - and I\u2019ve swallowed much bigger things in order to keep the peace for my son. HE is the only important one here - and the only one with so little choice in the matter. \n\nAs irksome as it is to picture stepmom sliding that $100 bill into her purse and chuckling about getting (another) one over on me, I\u2019m trying to stay aware that\u2019s not the most important thing. \n\nI\u2019m still considering and I want to talk to my son and get his view on what he thinks might happen and if it\u2019s too much for him to deal with. \n\nAnyway, thanks for your input!", "Explain that to her.  Tell her your concerns.  \n\nBecause she could have \"called you\" and asked if you got it as a cover. \n\nYou said you let things slide, it might be time to re think things.  Boundaries are a good thing.", "I\u2019m old enough not to care about downvotes, but thank you lol. \n\nI\u2019m also old enough to understand how infuriating and upsetting situations like these can be, and how they can temporarily affect our judgement.

My wife\u2019s family are profoundly gossipy.", "NTA - talk to your MIL to get some clarity", "This is a glorious script. It gives MIL all the information she needs and leaves OP looking gracious.", "Perfect! It gets the point across without throwing anyone under the bus.", "This is 100% the best way to handle it.", "This can\u2019t be the first time it\u2019s happened either. I would absolutely say something because I would never want someone who I have a cordial relationship with to think so lowly of me", "I disagree that you should let this slide.  I think it would set a better example for your son to see you stand up for yourself than to see you get walked all over.\n\nMy brother talks about how much he looked up to me as a woman who didn\u2019t let people take advantage of her.  He says having a deep respect for women has helped him in his professional career.\n\nChildren watch what we do and mimic some of it in the future.  What kind of woman would you like him to marry?  What kind of daughters would you like him to raise?\n\nMIL wanted the gift to go to you.  It should be yours.  Ask her about it without accusing anyone. If there is fallout for your child\u2019s father, maybe he will think twice next time before he decides to rob you.\n\nNTA.", "Thank you. I feel like this one has maybe gone too far because he lied to his mom!?"]}
