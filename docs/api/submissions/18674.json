{"id": 18674, "submission_id": "13x6cnh", "title": "WIBTA for telling my ex-MIL that her son kept a present she asked him to give to me?", "selftext": "The background: My ex and I divorced about 13 years ago. I have remained friendly with his mother since she\u2019s my son\u2019s grandmother and she has always been kind to me.  My ex and I generally get along with occasional conflicts. I try to \u201ctake the high road\u201d and I\u2019ve let many things slide.  He remarried about 10 years ago and frankly his wife hates me.  I just try to avoid her and be business-like when we must communicate. I am NOT a confrontational type person.\n\nNow the story: My son (a teenager) asked me recently if I\u2019d gotten a Mother\u2019s Day gift from \u201cMama\u201d (what he calls his grandmother).  I said no and he replied, \u201cI knew it!  I heard them talking and they weren\u2019t going to give it to you.  (stepmom) said she doesn\u2019t understand why Mama would STILL be giving you gifts.\u201d \n\nSo, apparently she sent a gift via her son and they decided not to pass it along.  (It was almost certainly a red envelope with some cash as that what she normally would give.)\n\nThe main things I\u2019m angry about are how disrespectful this is to his mother, and that she probably thinks I\u2019m ungrateful for not thanking her.  I hope this has never happened before. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of talking to her directly and asking if it\u2019s true.  If my son is mistaken, he should know so he doesn\u2019t think so badly of his dad. But if it\u2019s true, which I\u2019m inclined to believe, I might be stirring up family drama. \n\nSo, WIBTA for talking to her first?", "created_utc": 1685588218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13x6cnh/wibta_for_telling_my_exmil_that_her_son_kept_a/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019ll also let her know that if she wants to give you a gift, she can\u2019t trust her son as an intermediary. NTA", "I\u2019d ask your MIL, and I\u2019d likely do it like this \u201cson asked if I got your Mother\u2019s Day gift and I wanted to check in with you because it didn\u2019t come in the mail. I always appreciate how thoughtful you are and would hate to not have said thank you.\u201d \n\nIt doesn\u2019t throw your ex under the bus and give your ex-MIL a chance to handle it how she sees fit.", "NTA. If your son is right, your ex and his wife stole money from your former MIL after presumably having agreed to pass it on (after all, ex-MIL wouldn\u2019t have given it to them if they said \u2018no, we refuse to hand anything to that woman). Also, why should your relationship with ex-MIL possibly suffer through you seeming ungrateful for a gift she believes you received?", "\"Hi MIL. I have kind of an odd question for you...did you try to give me a present recently? Obviously, you have no obligation to do something like that, but if you did, I wanted you to know that I didn't get it so you can look into whatever shipping method you used. If you didn't, absolutely no worries--the only reason I'm even asking is that Son was confused by something he thought he overheard, and I wanted to double-check.\"\n\nNTA...and honestly, asking your MIL is really your only option since there's no way you can ask your ex anything about it without it being some kind of accusation. \n\nI know your son *thinks* he knows what his dad and stepmom were talking about (and it certainly sounds plausible), but they could have been speaking hypothetically or discussing the fact that your MIL asked them and they told her they didn't want to be go-betweens (so MIL had to figure out another way of getting it to you and she hasn't gotten around to it yet) or any of a number of other scenarios where they didn't do anything wrong.\n\nAnd the truth is, you don't know enough about what may or may not have happened to make an accusation, so if you *did* make an accusation, you *would* be stirring up family drama. But getting clarity on something in a completely non-accusatory way? The only way that can stir up family drama is if your ex is deliberately lying to his mother... And if he is, she deserves a chance to find that out for herself before he abuses her trust in a more significant way.", "NTA\n\nIt's great that you and her still get along but I believe if she wants you to have gifts she needs to give them to you herself, or at the very least give them to your son. Her son and daughter-in- law don't need to know anything about it. It's none of their business and she kind of makes it their business when she gives it to them.", "NTA. I would bring it up cautiously to your ex MIL so it\u2019s not accusatory towards your ex. Calling and saying \u201cSon claims to have overheard something and I had to ask- did you get me a mothers day gift by chance?\u201d And saying you haven\u2019t received it, but look forward to it. \u201cSon is worried that it won\u2019t get to me, but I\u2019m sure it will- ex is probably just forgetful.\u201d This kind of conversation sets up a dialogue to not make an issue of this event but to be suspicious in the future and might cause MIL to talk to ex about it to make sure he remembers to give you the gift.", "NTA", "NTA     just say, I'm a bit confused, grandson said something to me about about his father keeping a gift from you for me. I think he must have heard wrong, but just wanted to check with you.\n\nIt will come across as concern for your son, rather than an accusation against your ex.", "NTA.\n\nI agree that you should ask but I think you should ask your ex MIL. I'd bypass your ex husband altogether as he seems like he's massively under the thumb from the new wife and he'd probably lie to you. It's not being nasty it's trying to get to the truth. If your ex MIL has given her son a gift to give to you then that's what should happen. \n\nSeems like this new wife is having way too much involvement in situations that don't concern her. She shouldn't be hindering a good relationship between you and your ex MIL or your ex husband. She needs to keep her nose out of business that doesn't concern her.", "You: \u201cHey  ExHubby, I need to write your mother a thank you note. Could you tell me how much was in that present she asked you to give me?\u201d", "Sorry that your ex\u2019s wife is not very nice. You should contact your ex-husband and ask him about the gift to clear things up; maybe your son misunderstood or there is a gift.  If there is a gift, make sure to send a text and follow up with a thank you card in the mail. This will help your mil know if you receive any future gifts from her without having to ask her outright", "NTA, take her out for coffee and let her know your concerns in this matter.  Before you meet try to remember the gifts you have received and review them with her.  You said that it might be cash. How often have they taken part of the cash?  She needs to know what they are doing.  This is stealing from her and you.  If they are as bold to take this, it will escalate into taking other things from her as she gets older.", "NTA i kinda want an update so please let us know when you ask her lol", "She's probably been doing it every year. NTA", "NTA... let her k ow, otherwise she will wonder why you never aknowledge the gifts.", "NTA. But I\u2019m going to go out on a ledge here and gently suggest that your motives are not quite as altruistic as you portray. I don\u2019t blame you one bit; I would be pissed too. \n\nTake a step back and consider what the possible outcomes might be. In particular, consider the conflict that may fall on your son\u2019s shoulders, for ratting his father and stepmother out. \n\nI would suggest writing down all the options you see before you and mapping out the likely outcomes before you make your final decision.", "I agree with the commenters about reaching out directly to MIL but please make sure that she knows (once clarified) to try not to accidentally throw your son under the bus with his Dad and step mum, it sounds like Step mum can be vengeful and we don't want her retaliating against your son in anyway.", "Info : why have you been taking the \"high road, let it slide\" with your ex, when he obviously hasn't ? He disrespects you, and his now wife as issues with you, which is completely unreasonable.", "Diplomacy at its best.", "Perfect wording. NTA, OP. This is a very nice was of raising the subject", "This is the way.", "NTA - but you might be if you say nothing.      \nYou say not thanking your MIL might affect your relationship.         \nI\u2019d be more worried it would hurt her feelings.", ">Not acknowledging the gift may be hurting your relationship with your ex MIL and harming how she views you\n\nWhich may be part of the new wife\u2019s evil plan. Definitely NTA.", "Why not? Not everyone wants to insert their child into the middle of a load of unnecessary drama."]}
