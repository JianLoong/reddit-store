She only takes 1 persons food a day.\"\n\nShe took my food the last/first time i put it in the fridge resulting in me just not having food till 9pm. I've kept my food at my desk since, and stopped eating food that needs to be refrigerated, till I had an idea. I half cooked some food, but didn't make it even slightly edible. I left a typed up note on the food stating it wasnt fully cooked, but didn't leave my name on it. \n\nShe ate the food, and almost died, and had to spend 8 days in the hospital. The company can't figure out who's food it was, and now she's \"Afraid to come to work, and thinks somebody wants to end her\".\n\nSo My question is, Am I the Asshole here?
