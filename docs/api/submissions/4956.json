Will confirm that you can\u2019t say that word without some immediate repercussions coming your way. To say nothing about Jackson and those repercussions likely being violent. \n\nIf she wants to act like a pig in s*** by being overtly racist, then let her roll in s*** and have the stink speak for itself\n\nOP is super NTA", "I\u2019m a southerner that lived in a northern state for a decade and you\u2019re absolutely correct. The explicit segregation and racism I saw in that decade was more plentiful than I\u2019ve experienced in the entirety of three and a half decades below the Mason-Dixon line.", "Amen, Dolly! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd", "\"Yankee\" and \"up here\" mean the Northern US. So the commenter was saying that the North is more segregated and that the South is more integrated. They made these comments because it is a stereotype that the South is super racist and the North isn't. Honestly, I've lived all over the country. There are racists absolutely everywhere. Southern neighborhoods do tend to be divided by wealth rather than race, though.", "The difference between \"Northern\" vs \"Southern\" racism are in its subtleties. Northern racism isn't always overt; it's hidden in long-standing, understood and agreed upon behaviours and attitudes. Things like red-lining, ethnic/neighbourhood ghettoization, Robert Moses- and Levittown-inspired communities, not-in-my-backyard \"liberalism\".\n\nSouthern racism is usually overt. The racists are loud and proud, and people of good will avoid them as much as possible. It's not like it's portrayed in US media depicting Southern racism.\n\nThe US has always had a very weird way of handling and depicting its racism."]}
