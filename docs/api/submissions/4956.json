He told me he already had a talk with this friend of his and told him it wasn't okay.\nA few months later we met up with a few more friends and he started repeating the story and also said the n-word. A few days later I asked him why would he say this word, especially in my presence (I am mixed, though I am very white but I have darker skinned family and friends and am very much a feminist). He said stuff like \"it was only a joke\", \"I didn't mean it in a bad way and you know it\" & \"I have a dark sense of humour\"\n\nI tried talking sense into him but in the end he said that we wouldn't stop making jokes like these just for me, ignoring the history of this word and so I ended the friendship.
