I've lived in Alabama my whole life, & that shit is not acceptable. I can't imagine Mississippi is that different. She would be ostracized & publicly shamed. She's trash.\n\nEdit - there are racists everywhere, plenty of them up North, & bigots are gonna bigot. It's just not how it's portrayed in movies about the civil rights movement. Most people have evolved beyond that awful stupidity & are trying to identify & correct their biases; & those who haven't keep their prejudice to themselves, only voicing it in private among those who they expect to agree. \n\nIt's not socially acceptable to be racist; even in the Deep South. I can't imagine anything like your cousin's behavior coming from anyone under 70 years old around here, & most of them would still be decent to servers.", "NTA. But it\u2019s worth having a conversation with her to see if she understands anything any better now.", "NTA \n\nBeing from the southern US has nothing to do with it. She is just an ugly person.

But I would maybe have a real conversation with her and tell her why you are apprehensive about seeing her. Sounds like she was raised to use those words (even though now with the internet that\u2019s not really an excuse) and could use a reality check from someone who she respects and loves. But it is your choice it\u2019s not your responsibility to educate the racists.", "NTA. Doesn't matter the background. In 2022 everyone knows it's not acceptable or should.", "NTA\n\nTell her you don't want to hang out with racists.  \nYou don't respect them and if she can't see that using that word is wrong then don't bother calling you anymore.    Disown her.", "NTA. The company you keep definitely affects the way those around you see you and good on you for not wanting to associate closely with someone who\u2019s proven themself to be an unrepentant racist.", "NTA She\u2019s not a toddler repeating words without knowing the meaning. That word is a hateful slur that represents so many hateful things. Her saying that word means that she is willing to be associated with racism and hatred. You are not and you shouldn\u2019t compromise on your beliefs to make a racist feel comfortable.", "NTA\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be obligated to host her even if she hadn\u2019t said that word.", "NTA. Period.\n\nAnd you should make it perfectly clear, using unambiguous terms, why you won\u2019t host her.", "NTA", "I\u2019m from Tennessee, born and raised, and have only briefly lived elsewhere. We\u2019re not Mississippi, I\u2019ll give us that, but the distinction isn\u2019t actually that important, more brass tacks than anything in a discussion like this. The POINT is: reasonable people from all areas of the US are completely aware that the n-word specifically is out of bounds if you are not Black. Reasonable people includes people from the South. It\u2019s a little insulting your cousin would gesture to her upbringing as if being born below the Mason-Dixon is reason enough to be an asshole. \n\nYou said she was in college at the time, and it was a while ago, so I am assuming she was a teenager/very early 20s and also that the topic wasn\u2019t *quite* as broadly discussed as it is currently. But again, a few years ago versus today is brass tacks for a conversation like this. The n-word has one origin. One. No mistaking where it came from or who used it before it was reclaimed. \n\nDuring her previous visit her behavior was completely unacceptable and ran the gamut from covertly to overtly racist. You found this appalling, and good for you! But the larger and more important implication of her actions was that she caused harm to POC, ESPECIALLY those who were in service positions and could not choose to leave the situation once they realized she was a jerk. \n\nI\u2019d suggest you don\u2019t allow her to visit you and that you be explicit in your communication when you tell her why. And, when she\u2019s incredulous, denying she ever did those things and asking why it\u2019s such a big deal if she did, don\u2019t engage any further than calmly telling her \u201cyou don\u2019t have to understand why your actions hurt people, but you do have to stop hurting people\u201d.

This has nothing to do with her state and everything to do with her as a person. I would offer to meet her halfway and both vacation out of state, or maybe go to her.

You mention a bunch of times that her behavior reflected badly on you, but  the harm is to the people she was rude and dismissive to.", "NTA. People like that, if you interact with them at all, should never be brought into civilized company because their behavior will reflect on you. If you think there's a chance of being able to civilize and socialize your relative, do it in private until her manners are solid. For now she needs to have her heart blessed.\n\nMy German ex-girlfriend once shared a proverb she said was common in her country: \"If there are ten people eating at a table with one Nazi, what you have are eleven Nazis.\" Now it may not be true in all situations but there are lots of people who will judge you by the company you keep... not because they feel superior to you but because they no longer feel safe with you.", "NTA. I wouldn't want to host somebody like this. Please tell her why you don't want to host her, she might eventually LEARN.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s difficult when you care for somebody who has really cringy behavior.\nHave a discussion with her about her choice of words and attitudes, and let her know that the difference in your beliefs is causing issues in your relationship. It\u2019s no different than if somebody wanted to stay in your house and they like to smoke but you don\u2019t allow smoking in your house. \n\nSet the expectation first, and then give her the opportunity to decide if she is comfortable with those expectations.", "NTA she's racist. You did the right thing.", "NTA. There're lots of people in the South who aren't racist. And then there's your cousin.\n\nI'd have nothing to do with her if I were you.", "NTA.

During your time here last time, you were noticeably rude to anyone of color who was in what was in a service position. You never thanked or acknowledged the Black doorman of my building. You were short with and did not thank the servers when we went out if they weren't white. And then you dropped the N word at dinner, in front of my friends and everyone at surrounding tables.

Anywhere I\u2019ve been in the south, I\u2019ve just seen white & black ppl being completely normal to one another while living, working & learning together.\n\nIt\u2019s way better than so many places up north so it really irritates me to see other yanks perpetuating the south-is-so-racist stereotype because in my experience, southerners do a MUCH better job than northerners of truly being an integrated society.", "Lol thank you.\n\nI gave the Mississsippi disclaimer not because I make stereotypes about the South, but because a considerable amount of my family still live in Mississippi and I\u2019ve spent a lot of time there.
