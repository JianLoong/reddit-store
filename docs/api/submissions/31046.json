{"id": 31046, "submission_id": "17vyyt6", "title": "AITA for picking up my children a few minutes late from childcare (more than once)", "selftext": "My gym has childcare, which is so awesome and I\u2019m really grateful for it. \n\nMy favorite class is a yoga class scheduled from 11-noon, and the childcare also ends at noon. The class ends with everyone on their backs, completely silent - called shavasana. It also consistently ends a little late, usually at 12:05. So I\u2019ve been packing up early so I can pick up my kids right at noon, which requires rolling up my mat, putting on my shoes and opening the studio doors to the noisy gym - all of which I fear is a little distracting to the people in the class - they\u2019re trying to be present and quite their minds. You know, yoga stuff. I\u2019m as quiet as I can be, but still\u2026\n\nOne day I wasn\u2019t paying attention and the class was running even later, so when shavasana started and I started packing up it was already 12:05. When I picked up my daughter, I said sorry for being a few minutes late and the girl said, \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t do any later than noon. So you have to be here on time.\u201d I agreed and said sorry again. Then a few weeks later I pack up early and am walking over right at noon. I have my phone on do not disturb, so I don\u2019t see all the calls but from 12:00-12:01 (the time it takes me to get to the door), I have 3 missed calls. They quickly hand her off to me and fly out the door. Definitely picked up that they were annoyed I wasn\u2019t there on time again. \n\nToday, I asked gym management about it. Just asking about the conflict between the class end time and childcare, and whether there was a way of having them line up better or whether there\u2019s a grace period for pick up. He mentioned that the childcare workers get paid until noon and not after, so that\u2019s probably why they\u2019re eager to leave. I told him that I appreciate them and am not complaining about them, just wanted to bring it up as awkward situation each week.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a Karen and didn\u2019t want this to seem like a complaint to the manager kind of thing. I just feel like an AH leaving the class early and an AH when I\u2019m at all late for childcare. So just trying not to be an AH but probably failing \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit: Just to clarify a few points. It might be worth noting that the gym runs the childcare and listed the yoga class as a class during childcare times. The childcare is something I pay extra for, not free. Also, I\u2019m on time 99% of the time. Not chronically late. This happened by accident a few times, and only with this one class that lets out at the same time.\n\nLast edit: Thanks everyone for your comments, most of them were really thoughtful and helped me see the big picture. I\u2019d been timing my exit during the start of shavasana in order to make pick up on time (maybe that wasn\u2019t clear in my post since so many suggested it). But I think I\u2019m going to have to set a phone alarm (on vibrate, don\u2019t have an Apple Watch) since shavasana is inconsistent and doesn\u2019t always give me enough time. (Also, I\u2019ll chat with the yoga instructor and let her know my intentions. Maybe she can signal me if she doesn\u2019t want the alarm.)", "created_utc": 1700069922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vyyt6/aita_for_picking_up_my_children_a_few_minutes/", "score": 948, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they included the yoga class as something you can take while using the childcare they are setting their staff up to fail or just not get paid for those transition minutes. That said I'd suggest always packing up before the reflection time in the class to avoid being late (act like this is a hard deadline) or maybe just look for a gym that doesn't screw over it's employees. I was in childcare and preschool before teaching and generally those very important positions don't pay crap. I had one friend at college who quit the preschool she was working at (fairly well renowed one in the area) to wait tables at a popular restaurant because with tips she was making more as a waitress than as a childcare worker and being in college she needed to be able to pay the bills.", "NAH. Gym ownership is T A H.", "Yeah, YTA. It's not cool for you to force the childcare workers to stay beyond the end of their shift, even moreso if they're not getting paid when they have to stay late. Sounds like you need to either pick a different yoga class, arrange different childcare, or leave the class early enough to not be disruptive. Pack up like 10-15 minutes early so that you're out of there before shavasana and no one else is negatively effected.", "if the gym is offering the childcare and says the yoga class can use childcare, it seems to me it's up to the gym to make sure the schedules work, and maybe they should pay either their childcare workers an extra half hour, or make sure the yoga class ends at 1155 pm.  They are the ones setting the schedules.\n\nI would point that out to mgmt and then just leave the class at precisely 1155 or find a different activity.  If you do that, NTA, it's up to them to fix their schedules.  If you continue to be late... then well YTA.\n\nAlso DND when you have children in care is a bit risky, as something dire could have happened....", "The gym is TA here. They cannot promote a class as having child care options and then not provide child care that extends even a few minutes beyond the finish of that class! Especially with a yoga session, where it is disruptive for people to be packing up during the relaxation wind down. If you use the service again, please consider giving the child care workers vouchers or cash, to cover their time that they provided for free to care for your child.   \nAlso let the gym know that this would be a factor in renewing your membership, as it is causing stress to you, other attendees, your kids AND their child care workers- they should sort it out. You are likely not the only one in this position. \n\nYou would only be TA if you continue with this arrangement as is.

So just trying not to be an AH but probably failing \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe alternative is putting employees - who may very well have to get to their next job (daycare does not pay well) - in the position of deciding whether or not to leave a child unattended. It's deeply unfair to them.\n\nSo if this keeps happening, YWBTA. \n\nYou know you're going to have to leave early, so keep an eye on the clock.", "NTA in this specific circumstance.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, if you are late because you wanted to finish a few sets or have a coffee with your mates that would make you an AH. But in this specific scheduling situation you are not an AH.\n\nAs a former gym manager, the AH is management.\n\nA good manager would see the very obviously problem here and fix it. The fix is very easy. Shorten the class by 5 mins and/or pay cr\u00e8che staff the extra 5-10 minutes they\u2019re there.\n\nOne of the most common questions I was asked is \u2018do you have a creche?\u2019 So many parents (but let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s usually mostly mothers), simply cannot go to the gym without one. Creches bring in money to the business.\n\nIt\u2019s also common for the largest demographic in group classes to be women, especially during the day.\n\nSoooo, it is a no-brainer that management needs to improve their policies regarding class scheduling and also staff pay. The scheduled class duration should simply not conflict with the childcare hours.\n\nAnd if staff have to go over their rostered shift for 5-10 minutes that should be clearly spelled out in their contract and they should be paid for it.", "YTA\n\nYour yoga is not more important than the childcare staff getting off work on time. Either take a class at a different time or find your own childcare. You're abusing the situation.\n\nEdit based on your edit: The gym's childcare is not specifically for your class. It is a convenience for all gym goers. It ends at 12, not 12:10 or 12:15. So if your class ends late, that's still your responsibility to pick up your child before 12 when the workers stop being paid. You wouldn't want to get out of work late and not be paid either. They may have something to get to and you're screwing with their day. It doesn't matter if if it just happens once in a while. It shouldn't happen at all. Imagine if they have 5 kids to watch and a different parent or a couple of parents are late for pickup. Should they spend extra (unpaid) time every day with kids and trying to check them out just because parents don't respect their time?", "Talk to the yoga teacher. It\u2019s on her to keep class from running over.

This one's on the gym. If they're offering this class in this time slot as one within childcare-available hours, they should absolutely be accounting for the time it takes to put away your gear and get to the childcare location. They should either be ending the class at 11:45 or paying their employees till 12:15. That seems like a clear scheduling oversight to me, especially since you're paying for the service.\n\nNow, if the gym doesn't resolve it then you're gonna have to think of a better solution because you can't keep being late to get the kids. Maybe talk to the instructor and let them know you'll have to leave five minutes before the end of class to get your kids. They might even work to accommodate that in their teaching.", "Hold on why is everyone saying Y T A?\n\nThe gym runs both the yoga class and the childcare.  So if the gyms own yoga class runs over, this really feels like a them problem.\n\nThey cannot be flexible with their classes but rigid with the childcare....\n\nfor me you're NTA, this is something the gym needs to sort out internally.", "This is definitely a management problem.\n\nGym provides childcare for a fee: awesome!

People love that.\n\nGym deliberately schedules both to end at the same time: STUPID.\n\nThe gym has set this situation up for failure: either you leave the class early or you are late to the childcare.  That's badly designed, and it needs to be fixed.\n\nYou cannot be the only person with this problem.", "YTA\n\nI see why the timing is weird, but the daycare isn\u2019t meant to line up with that one yoga class.

If your class ends at 1205 then it\u2019s just not feasible for you to attend the whole class and use the daycare.\n\nSeeing your edit: this is something you should feel empowered to take up with gym management/ownership, but not break the rules for. Find a way to know when it is 11:58 so you can make it. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s the way it is until/unless management changes the schedule. \n\nAnd a little $10 gift card to the staff by way of apology for last lateness will go a long way.", "The teacher should be mindful that this is a class adverstised during child care hours and make sure she is finished before or right at 12.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised by the y votes. The manager is not doing their job properly. If the class says childcare is available then IT IS. If the instructor goes late, MANAGE her.

I don't know if it's worth mentioning the issue to the yoga instructor to see if they'd be willing to be mindful of the time or give you a gentle tap when it's time to go (though that really shouldn't be their job), or if you wear a smart watch or something that can give you a gentle vibrating (so sound) alarm to alert you 10 or so minutes before noon would help.

You're paying for an entire yoga class, which was advertised as being compatible with the childcare, and you shouldn't have to leave early; the teacher should be managing the class time properly and cool down exercises are important.\n\nI would actually approach this from the other direction, and approach the yoga teacher about needing to end on time. \n\nAnd also be prepared to escalate to gym management that their treatment of the childcare workers is unacceptable too. Gym classes should definitely end on time, but also, after the class ends people may need to change into clean clothes, go to the toilet or whatever - if childcare is advertised for those classes, then they need to take into account that gym users cannot teleport instantaneously to pick up the kids, and should be giving parents 5-10 minutes' grace to pick the kids up. And the childcare workers likely need to do some tidying after all the kids are gone, so they should be being paid for at least 15 minutes (bare minimum) after the final class cover finishes.", "The gym is a jerk to its employees for creating this situation.

That's poor management by the gym.  They can't say a class is during day care hours and then have the day care end at *exactly* the same time as the class.  You should discuss this with the manager again a little more firmly that it's an issue and try to get them them to either shift the class time to maybe start and end fifteen minutes earlier or have the daycare hours changed to 12:15.

Ultimately, we are paid until a set time but can't leave kids unattended. So you have to sit there, but get no money for it.

If someone was 15 mins late to pick up their kids, that was 15 minutes I wasn\u2019t paid, plus 10-20 minutes of cleaning. Also, if I wasn\u2019t out of there on the dot of the end of my scheduled shift, you bet your ass I had a manger on me about it \u201ctaking too long\u201d for me to close the childcare area, even if I had a kid in there. \n\nI understand that your class was advertised as \u201cduring childcare hours\u201d however the reality is, it\u2019s not working out that way.

They don\u2019t want to pay for childcare in their gym at all, and the only reason childcare exists in the gym at all is because housewives bring in a LOT of money for them and it\u2019s an easy cash grab, because you\u2019ll pick their gym over one that doesn\u2019t have on site childcare every time.", "YTA, but I would definitely ask the childcare staff and management if you are allowed to tip the staff.

The class ends with everyone on their backs, completely silent - called shavasana. It also consistently ends a little late, usually at 12:05. So I\u2019ve been packing up early so I can pick up my kids right at noon, which requires rolling up my mat, putting on my shoes and opening the studio doors to the noisy gym - all of which I fear is a little distracting to the people in the class - they\u2019re trying to be present and quite their minds. You know, yoga stuff. I\u2019m as quiet as I can be, but still\u2026\n\nOne day I wasn\u2019t paying attention and the class was running even later, so when shavasana started and I started packing up it was already 12:05. When I picked up my daughter, I said sorry for being a few minutes late and the girl said, \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t do any later than noon. So you have to be here on time.\u201d I agreed and said sorry again. Then a few weeks later I pack up early and am walking over right at noon. I have my phone on do not disturb, so I don\u2019t see all the calls but from 12:00-12:01 (the time it takes me to get to the door), I have 3 missed calls. They quickly hand her off to me and fly out the door. Definitely picked up that they were annoyed I wasn\u2019t there on time again. \n\nToday, I asked gym management about it. Just asking about the conflict between the class end time and childcare, and whether there was a way of having them line up better or whether there\u2019s a grace period for pick up. He mentioned that the childcare workers get paid until noon and not after, so that\u2019s probably why they\u2019re eager to leave. I told him that I appreciate them and am not complaining about them, just wanted to bring it up as awkward situation each week.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a Karen and didn\u2019t want this to seem like a complaint to the manager kind of thing.

Pick your kids up on time", "Yes", "Yes, YTA but I have an idea:\n\nWhy don\u2019t you call the gym and ask in advance if there is any way anyone could help you for a few extra $$$? I would offer $15 cash to anyone who stayed past 12 to help you. \n\nMake it worth the staff\u2019s while. If they say they aren\u2019t allowed to do this, respect that but maybe there are people who could help you if it was worth their while.", "NTA", "Yta.  \n\nYou know it closes at 12.  Be there at 12.", "Why not take an earlier class?  Is that the only time option?", "YTA\n\nYou need to pick your child up at 11:55pm...Closed at 12, means the doors are closed, locked, and staff are walking away. Not \"entitled yoga mom thinks she can pick her kid up at 12\". \n\nIt's stupid that the gym times don't line up, but that's the way it is. You aren't in control of the gym times, of the yoga teachers' schedule, or the daycare workers. It's not the teachers job to disrupt herself or the tempo of her class to monitor your schedule.\n\nYou're an adult. Manage your time appropriately.", "YTA They don\u2019t want to do unpaid work but having a child in your care isn\u2019t something you just walk away from. You know all of the pertinent information. You make a choice.", "Gentle YTA, my gym has childcare as well and yes my kids have their own memberships so they can use the childcare.  \n\nCommunication is key.  If you have an issue with class times and childcare times, you say something to management to see if they can change policies or what not, which it seems like you have done. You aren't in anyway an AH for asking them to change their policies. This is a valid ask.  \n\n\nYTA because regardless of if these people are being paid for the time they are working, if their shift ends at 12 and they have to stay until 12:05/12.10 for you then that can make a big difference to them.  \n\nDo they have an appointment? Another job? A child of their own to pick up? It honestly doesn't matter. What matters is that their time is only until noon and picking up your child late, while accidental, is not in the agreement.  You can make a mistake and they have every right to be annoyed even though you have no malicious intent.  But you cannot expect them to not be annoyed with what happened.  \n\nAlso maybe communicate with the staff when you drop your child off.  A simple \"hey, my class gets done at 12 and I rush over here to grab my child in time! I try my best to be here at noon, but sometimes I run late, is that okay?\"   And you'd be surprised at how much more accommodating they will be for you.  A \"sure, but I need to leave by 12:05 at the latest\" or a \"I  cannot stay later than noon\" would be 2 likely responses. Both are valid and reasonable.  But at least there was communication to the staff about the issue at hand and also a way of letting them know that you understand that they have lives and commitments as well and are not just there for you.", "YTA\n\nEven though it's crappy the gym does not have more flexibility with class ending times and childcare closings, it still doesn't make it right to be late to picking your child up. \n\nThey are telling you when it ends and you're disregarding it. That's disrespectful.", "YTA. Either go to an earlier class, hire a sitter, or go to a different gym. You have known from the start when the childcare ends. You should not have taken a yoga class that ends at the same time, because you would never actually make it to pick up on time.

They can't align childcare hours with every class they offer.  It's your responsibility to fit your workout in around their schedule. See if you can grab a place closest to the door so you don't feel as disruptive leaving early", "ESH - the gym should not exploit childcare workers (if classes finish at 12, pay childcare staff till 12.15 or schedule classes to finish earlier; no unpaid overtime), the class teacher needs to manage better (don\u2019t overrun), and parents need to watch the clock regardless of everything I just said (because it\u2019s still your responsibility to pick up your kids on time)", "YTA. You can always leave the class later (just give the instructor a heads up). If you\u2019re late even 30 seconds, if anything happens to your child or the staffers because of your child, insurance prolly doesn\u2019t cover that. Even if you\u2019re willing to take the risks, doesn\u2019t mean others should because of you. Sorry that the two don\u2019t line up better but that\u2019s why we need to be more careful. Prioritize things.", "Is that even really a question? YTA. You KNOW your kid has to be picked up no later than noon. It's not like you're coming from fucking WORK and running a few min late. You're going to a fucking yoga class. Why are you going to a yoga class that finishes at noon and later when your kid is supposed to be picked up at noon? Like......", "YTA, if you keep doing it knowing you'll be consistently a little late but really the gym is the asshole for not running a daycare appropriately. The daycare should run until 12:15 to accommodate their 11am classes, and if a parent is running late the workers should be paid the extra half hour to accommodate that.", "ESH\n\nI think the gym management is causing this problem by not employing the childcare workers long enough to actually cover the classes that the parents are taking. It's a poor setup that isn't fully providing the value it's supposed to.\n\nStill, until the situation is fixed, you've got to be the one who makes it to pick up your kids on time. When you aren't, the childcare workers are getting the short end of the stick. I don't think you're necessarily an asshole for tripping up a couple times, but they don't deserve to make up for the poor management. Your plan to get out ahead of the quiet period sounds good to me.\n\nThis is the sort of thing I'd put in a Google review; if the childcare is meant to bring in customers, but it's only going to create headaches like this, a person should be inclined to look elsewhere.", "I used to work childcare at a yoga studio and YTA.

Take a different class. It isn't fair to the others for you to distract them by leaving early.", "YTA - pick your child up on time.

I also go to a gym with a cr\u00e8che, and they\u2019re strict on pick up too. Their reason is that they have parents coming for the next time slot that are there on the dot, and it\u2019s hard having to manage kids who are late. I get it, but just leave earlier. Childcare gyms are great, I\u2019d try not to step on toes", "YTA for choosing a class you know ends exactly when childcare ends and often runs late. If your child is the last one there, every other parent figured out a way to be there by noon. As a lifelong worker in the childcare industry, in can tell you, the employees are making appointments and other plans for after their shifts that are affected when parents are late.\n\nI am assuming they don't push back childcare until 12:15 because then people would push pickup until 12:20. That is no excuse for the gym not to pay, and as others have mentioned it creates a HUGE liability for them. It also doesn't give them time for state mandated cleaning and sanitation or any paperwork that needs filling out. It's bad business practice for sure.", "What kind of gun only has child care until noon?! AND had a class ending simultaneously, that always ends late?!\n\nThe gym is TA.

The gym is at fault, not OP.", "I was thinking this too BUT it sounds like it\u2019s in-house child care AT the gym? Which makes me feel less like OP is TA because like\u2026 why would gym scheduling be like that lmao", "No, you are wrong! This is 100% the gym\u2019s fault here, they need to either schedule the workers for longer or the teacher needs to end the class sooner, full stop.

She's making her lateness someone else's problem which is not okay.", "Bingo! As a former daycare provider we used to charge $5 per minute per child that they were late. Get there on time and get your child. We made a few exceptions. (ex: parent would call and they got caught behind an accident, etc.) Stuff happens but it sounds like OP was not caring to make sure they were on time.", "Yes, absolutely - the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. OP is doing her best and getting told off either way. Gym needs to end class at 11:55 or extend childcare to 12:05.

If you have to pick up your kids at noon and a class ends at noon, there is absolutely going to be an overage in child care unless you leave early. \n\nThe OP could watch the clock or set an alarm to give ample time for pickup. Maybe schedule a class that doesn't end when last call for pickup begins? The gym may advertise the class as childcare accessible but if they have the hours that is in you to take the responsibility to arrive on time.", "Fine. But then you sort it with the gym first.

It\u2019s completely the gym management\u2019s issue! Poor OP!", "Especially since they're advertising this class as having childcare available *and* charging extra for it.

That's not on her, that's on gym management.", "And what would you even complain to the manager about? That the daycare workers wanted to leave on time? That they didn\u2019t want to work for free? Also, you\u2019re one person doing it, but if that becomes the norm, then those workers are there waiting on a ton of different kids for their parents to come pick them up. You are notmore special than any of the other parents who are using the service", "Yeah, it's on the manager, but OP is effectively punishing the employee by coming late.

Bad management/planning. \n\nAll that said, you should still aim to get your kid by noon if that\u2019s when the program ends.", "Yes. Management needs to adjust the schedule of the yoga class so that it actually ends before noon and ensure the instructor ends on time. Personally shavasana is one of my favorite parts, it\u2019s when you get to actually relax after all the stretching and work.", "I\u2019m a yoga teacher and someone needs to tell that teacher to get their shit together. When I was in training it was made pretty clear that keeping students late was a form of stealing, which is contrary to one of the yamas, ahimsa or non stealing, as laid out in the Yoga Sutras by Patanjali. The yamas and the niyamas are the basic rules of conduct for anyone who follows yogic teachings. Everyone who gets their certification should be very familiar with these rules. \n\nA few minutes I can understand and there are always students who want to stay late to sit with their practice or chat, but 15? That\u2019s not okay. I\u2019m not familiar with how gyms pay their teachers, I\u2019ve only worked in studios thus far, but you get paid for the class and a percentage of the number of students. There is no financial incentive to keep folks like. It just shows a lack of planning, time management and consideration for their students on the teacher\u2019s part to keep them late like that.", "Agree, this is the gyms problem. Manager needs to manage to manage...", "Exactly. The time should be set in stone for the childcare workers. They might have their OWN classes they will be tardy for if people are late on collecting their children.", "Right?! \nYou cannot pick your kid at 12 when you class doesn\u2019t end until 12.", "Oh I totally agree with you. The childcare workers should be scheduled and paid for an extra 15 minutes if not an extra half hour so that they're not having to stay late if parents don't come on time. OP can certainly complain to management about that. But until things change, not picking her kids up on time is only going to negatively affect the childcare workers, and that's not fair to them.", "It doesn't matter what time they pay the staff until, there will always be people like OP who think that \"Closed at 12\" means pick up your kid at 12.\n\nOP needs to be getting there a 11:55, not 12. The time the other class ends is irrelevant.", "Exactly this. It's the gym that's TA because customers are paying for both the yoga class and the childcare that is advertised as a package deal- childcare specifically available so you can go to their yoga class.

I've been held over up to 15 minutes in yoga classes, which I find really annoying. I think all classes should end on time so the participants can plan the rest of their day.

Yes it's inconvenient that the class ends at the same time, but OP is aware of this and needs not to be late. \n\nThe manager is to blame for the conflicting times, but OP is to blame for not being conscious of the time.", "While this would be ideal, people with low-paying jobs like childcare often have multiple jobs, and might be less likely to agree to be employed without a definite end time.  The childcare worker was probably flying out the door because s/he was about  to be late to their next job.", "They have places to go as well.  They shouldn't expect day care to work later; they should arrive on time... or find other place... or change their yoga schedule.", "This is my issue. If I am paying extra for childcare so that I can attend a class that the gym itself states is during childcare time, the gym needs to manage the hours of it better. \n\nBecause even if she finishes class at exactly 12, which is when it does finish, she would still need to take a couple minutes to pack up and make it to the childcare area. \n\nThis is completely on management and frankly, I would say that they need to extend childcare 10-15 minutes longer and pay the employees for it.", "The gym may be refusing to pay the childcare workers past noon.

Unless they're making them clock out and then keep working, which is also not legal.", "That\u2019s not true, most gyms have morning classes, lunch classes and then start again in the late afternoon.

If it was an understandable lateness like weather, I personally wouldn't ask for the extra cash. If it was a constant thing, we would talk to the parents about it. If it was constant.

I worked somewhere that had to change it from $2/minute to $5/minute for the first 15 minutes, and $10/minute afterwards, because parents were happily abusing $2/minute and coming anywhere from 10-50 minutes late for pickup and just dropping some cash for the teachers - but some of those teachers had kids to pickup from school/childcare and lives to live.  I found this particularly true when I worked at a centre that attracted a large number of affluent families.", "You said neither of those things in any comment to me or in any comments I replied to. That's not what my reply was to or about. Why are you acting like I should know this, or like it changes anything I said?
