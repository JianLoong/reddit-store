{"id": 31046, "submission_id": "17vyyt6", "title": "AITA for picking up my children a few minutes late from childcare (more than once)", "selftext": "My gym has childcare, which is so awesome and I\u2019m really grateful for it. \n\nMy favorite class is a yoga class scheduled from 11-noon, and the childcare also ends at noon. The class ends with everyone on their backs, completely silent - called shavasana. It also consistently ends a little late, usually at 12:05. So I\u2019ve been packing up early so I can pick up my kids right at noon, which requires rolling up my mat, putting on my shoes and opening the studio doors to the noisy gym - all of which I fear is a little distracting to the people in the class - they\u2019re trying to be present and quite their minds. You know, yoga stuff. I\u2019m as quiet as I can be, but still\u2026\n\nOne day I wasn\u2019t paying attention and the class was running even later, so when shavasana started and I started packing up it was already 12:05. When I picked up my daughter, I said sorry for being a few minutes late and the girl said, \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t do any later than noon. So you have to be here on time.\u201d I agreed and said sorry again. Then a few weeks later I pack up early and am walking over right at noon. I have my phone on do not disturb, so I don\u2019t see all the calls but from 12:00-12:01 (the time it takes me to get to the door), I have 3 missed calls. They quickly hand her off to me and fly out the door. Definitely picked up that they were annoyed I wasn\u2019t there on time again. \n\nToday, I asked gym management about it. Just asking about the conflict between the class end time and childcare, and whether there was a way of having them line up better or whether there\u2019s a grace period for pick up. He mentioned that the childcare workers get paid until noon and not after, so that\u2019s probably why they\u2019re eager to leave. I told him that I appreciate them and am not complaining about them, just wanted to bring it up as awkward situation each week.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a Karen and didn\u2019t want this to seem like a complaint to the manager kind of thing. I just feel like an AH leaving the class early and an AH when I\u2019m at all late for childcare. So just trying not to be an AH but probably failing \ud83d\ude05\n\nEdit: Just to clarify a few points. It might be worth noting that the gym runs the childcare and listed the yoga class as a class during childcare times. The childcare is something I pay extra for, not free. Also, I\u2019m on time 99% of the time. Not chronically late. This happened by accident a few times, and only with this one class that lets out at the same time.\n\nLast edit: Thanks everyone for your comments, most of them were really thoughtful and helped me see the big picture. I\u2019d been timing my exit during the start of shavasana in order to make pick up on time (maybe that wasn\u2019t clear in my post since so many suggested it). But I think I\u2019m going to have to set a phone alarm (on vibrate, don\u2019t have an Apple Watch) since shavasana is inconsistent and doesn\u2019t always give me enough time. (Also, I\u2019ll chat with the yoga instructor and let her know my intentions. Maybe she can signal me if she doesn\u2019t want the alarm.)", "created_utc": 1700069922, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vyyt6/aita_for_picking_up_my_children_a_few_minutes/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they included the yoga class as something you can take while using the childcare they are setting their staff up to fail or just not get paid for those transition minutes. That said I'd suggest always packing up before the reflection time in the class to avoid being late (act like this is a hard deadline) or maybe just look for a gym that doesn't screw over it's employees. I was in childcare and preschool before teaching and generally those very important positions don't pay crap. I had one friend at college who quit the preschool she was working at (fairly well renowed one in the area) to wait tables at a popular restaurant because with tips she was making more as a waitress than as a childcare worker and being in college she needed to be able to pay the bills.", "NAH. Gym ownership is T A H.", "Yeah, YTA. It's not cool for you to force the childcare workers to stay beyond the end of their shift, even moreso if they're not getting paid when they have to stay late. Sounds like you need to either pick a different yoga class, arrange different childcare, or leave the class early enough to not be disruptive. Pack up like 10-15 minutes early so that you're out of there before shavasana and no one else is negatively effected.", "if the gym is offering the childcare and says the yoga class can use childcare, it seems to me it's up to the gym to make sure the schedules work, and maybe they should pay either their childcare workers an extra half hour, or make sure the yoga class ends at 1155 pm.  They are the ones setting the schedules.\n\nI would point that out to mgmt and then just leave the class at precisely 1155 or find a different activity.  If you do that, NTA, it's up to them to fix their schedules.  If you continue to be late... then well YTA.\n\nAlso DND when you have children in care is a bit risky, as something dire could have happened....", "The gym is TA here. They cannot promote a class as having child care options and then not provide child care that extends even a few minutes beyond the finish of that class! Especially with a yoga session, where it is disruptive for people to be packing up during the relaxation wind down. If you use the service again, please consider giving the child care workers vouchers or cash, to cover their time that they provided for free to care for your child.   \nAlso let the gym know that this would be a factor in renewing your membership, as it is causing stress to you, other attendees, your kids AND their child care workers- they should sort it out. You are likely not the only one in this position. \n\nYou would only be TA if you continue with this arrangement as is.

So just trying not to be an AH but probably failing \ud83d\ude05\n\nThe alternative is putting employees - who may very well have to get to their next job (daycare does not pay well) - in the position of deciding whether or not to leave a child unattended. It's deeply unfair to them.\n\nSo if this keeps happening, YWBTA. \n\nYou know you're going to have to leave early, so keep an eye on the clock.", "NTA in this specific circumstance.\n\nNow don\u2019t get me wrong, if you are late because you wanted to finish a few sets or have a coffee with your mates that would make you an AH. But in this specific scheduling situation you are not an AH.\n\nAs a former gym manager, the AH is management.\n\nA good manager would see the very obviously problem here and fix it. The fix is very easy. Shorten the class by 5 mins and/or pay cr\u00e8che staff the extra 5-10 minutes they\u2019re there.\n\nOne of the most common questions I was asked is \u2018do you have a creche?\u2019 So many parents (but let\u2019s be honest it\u2019s usually mostly mothers), simply cannot go to the gym without one. Creches bring in money to the business.\n\nIt\u2019s also common for the largest demographic in group classes to be women, especially during the day.\n\nSoooo, it is a no-brainer that management needs to improve their policies regarding class scheduling and also staff pay. The scheduled class duration should simply not conflict with the childcare hours.\n\nAnd if staff have to go over their rostered shift for 5-10 minutes that should be clearly spelled out in their contract and they should be paid for it.", "YTA\n\nYour yoga is not more important than the childcare staff getting off work on time. Either take a class at a different time or find your own childcare. You're abusing the situation.\n\nEdit based on your edit: The gym's childcare is not specifically for your class. It is a convenience for all gym goers. It ends at 12, not 12:10 or 12:15. So if your class ends late, that's still your responsibility to pick up your child before 12 when the workers stop being paid. You wouldn't want to get out of work late and not be paid either. They may have something to get to and you're screwing with their day. It doesn't matter if if it just happens once in a while. It shouldn't happen at all. Imagine if they have 5 kids to watch and a different parent or a couple of parents are late for pickup. Should they spend extra (unpaid) time every day with kids and trying to check them out just because parents don't respect their time?", "Talk to the yoga teacher. It\u2019s on her to keep class from running over.

This one's on the gym. If they're offering this class in this time slot as one within childcare-available hours, they should absolutely be accounting for the time it takes to put away your gear and get to the childcare location. They should either be ending the class at 11:45 or paying their employees till 12:15. That seems like a clear scheduling oversight to me, especially since you're paying for the service.\n\nNow, if the gym doesn't resolve it then you're gonna have to think of a better solution because you can't keep being late to get the kids. Maybe talk to the instructor and let them know you'll have to leave five minutes before the end of class to get your kids. They might even work to accommodate that in their teaching.", "Hold on why is everyone saying Y T A?\n\nThe gym runs both the yoga class and the childcare.  So if the gyms own yoga class runs over, this really feels like a them problem.\n\nThey cannot be flexible with their classes but rigid with the childcare....\n\nfor me you're NTA, this is something the gym needs to sort out internally.", "This is definitely a management problem.\n\nGym provides childcare for a fee: awesome!

People love that.\n\nGym deliberately schedules both to end at the same time: STUPID.\n\nThe gym has set this situation up for failure: either you leave the class early or you are late to the childcare.  That's badly designed, and it needs to be fixed.\n\nYou cannot be the only person with this problem.", "YTA\n\nI see why the timing is weird, but the daycare isn\u2019t meant to line up with that one yoga class.

If your class ends at 1205 then it\u2019s just not feasible for you to attend the whole class and use the daycare.\n\nSeeing your edit: this is something you should feel empowered to take up with gym management/ownership, but not break the rules for. Find a way to know when it is 11:58 so you can make it. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s the way it is until/unless management changes the schedule. \n\nAnd a little $10 gift card to the staff by way of apology for last lateness will go a long way.", "The teacher should be mindful that this is a class adverstised during child care hours and make sure she is finished before or right at 12.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I\u2019m surprised by the y votes. The manager is not doing their job properly. If the class says childcare is available then IT IS. If the instructor goes late, MANAGE her.

I don't know if it's worth mentioning the issue to the yoga instructor to see if they'd be willing to be mindful of the time or give you a gentle tap when it's time to go (though that really shouldn't be their job), or if you wear a smart watch or something that can give you a gentle vibrating (so sound) alarm to alert you 10 or so minutes before noon would help.

You're paying for an entire yoga class, which was advertised as being compatible with the childcare, and you shouldn't have to leave early; the teacher should be managing the class time properly and cool down exercises are important.\n\nI would actually approach this from the other direction, and approach the yoga teacher about needing to end on time. \n\nAnd also be prepared to escalate to gym management that their treatment of the childcare workers is unacceptable too. Gym classes should definitely end on time, but also, after the class ends people may need to change into clean clothes, go to the toilet or whatever - if childcare is advertised for those classes, then they need to take into account that gym users cannot teleport instantaneously to pick up the kids, and should be giving parents 5-10 minutes' grace to pick the kids up. And the childcare workers likely need to do some tidying after all the kids are gone, so they should be being paid for at least 15 minutes (bare minimum) after the final class cover finishes.", "The gym is a jerk to its employees for creating this situation.

That's poor management by the gym.  They can't say a class is during day care hours and then have the day care end at *exactly* the same time as the class.  You should discuss this with the manager again a little more firmly that it's an issue and try to get them them to either shift the class time to maybe start and end fifteen minutes earlier or have the daycare hours changed to 12:15.

Ultimately, we are paid until a set time but can't leave kids unattended. So you have to sit there, but get no money for it.

If someone was 15 mins late to pick up their kids, that was 15 minutes I wasn\u2019t paid, plus 10-20 minutes of cleaning. Also, if I wasn\u2019t out of there on the dot of the end of my scheduled shift, you bet your ass I had a manger on me about it \u201ctaking too long\u201d for me to close the childcare area, even if I had a kid in there. \n\nI understand that your class was advertised as \u201cduring childcare hours\u201d however the reality is, it\u2019s not working out that way.

They don\u2019t want to pay for childcare in their gym at all, and the only reason childcare exists in the gym at all is because housewives bring in a LOT of money for them and it\u2019s an easy cash grab, because you\u2019ll pick their gym over one that doesn\u2019t have on site childcare every time.", "YTA, but I would definitely ask the childcare staff and management if you are allowed to tip the staff.

The class ends with everyone on their backs, completely silent - called shavasana. It also consistently ends a little late, usually at 12:05. So I\u2019ve been packing up early so I can pick up my kids right at noon, which requires rolling up my mat, putting on my shoes and opening the studio doors to the noisy gym - all of which I fear is a little distracting to the people in the class - they\u2019re trying to be present and quite their minds. You know, yoga stuff. I\u2019m as quiet as I can be, but still\u2026\n\nOne day I wasn\u2019t paying attention and the class was running even later, so when shavasana started and I started packing up it was already 12:05. When I picked up my daughter, I said sorry for being a few minutes late and the girl said, \u201cYeah, we don\u2019t do any later than noon. So you have to be here on time.\u201d I agreed and said sorry again. Then a few weeks later I pack up early and am walking over right at noon. I have my phone on do not disturb, so I don\u2019t see all the calls but from 12:00-12:01 (the time it takes me to get to the door), I have 3 missed calls. They quickly hand her off to me and fly out the door. Definitely picked up that they were annoyed I wasn\u2019t there on time again. \n\nToday, I asked gym management about it. Just asking about the conflict between the class end time and childcare, and whether there was a way of having them line up better or whether there\u2019s a grace period for pick up. He mentioned that the childcare workers get paid until noon and not after, so that\u2019s probably why they\u2019re eager to leave. I told him that I appreciate them and am not complaining about them, just wanted to bring it up as awkward situation each week.\n\nI don\u2019t want to be a Karen and didn\u2019t want this to seem like a complaint to the manager kind of thing.

Management needs to get their shit together.", "No, but the yoga class was specifically advertised as being compatible with the gym's childcare.", "Yeah, but this class is advertised as childcare being available.", "If the end of class doesn't align with the end of childcare, it's the user's responsibility. The childcare is for the whole gym, not just the classes. 12 was chosen as the cutoff for childcare. If a class runs past that, the parent is still accountable. If someone was working out on equipment and picked up their child late, it would be the same thing.", "Stop grasping at straws.", "They ARE NOT obligated to staff childcare. Most gyms have MULTIPLE classes at the same and various times. This daycare closes at noon. Period. If a yoga class starts at 12:15 do gym members then have the right to kvetch because THEY don\u2019t have free daycare for THEIR class?\n\nStop acting entitled. She is entitled to daycare until noon. Period.", "I used to do childminding in a YMCA and if a chronically late parent handed me a fiver everytime due to a class I would've been perfectly happy letting them do so! I can see an issue arising if other parents or the bosses caught wind of it though as I'm sure I would've been fired lmao so not worth it when thought through.", "I definitely meant the gym/employer should do it. It\u2019s their responsibility to pay their workers.", "Won't work. Childcare needs to finish at least 30 minutes after the scheduled activity. Can't be the same time. Otherwise, the gym isn't holding up their end of the bargain.", ">It might be worth noting that the gym runs the childcare and listed the yoga class as a class during childcare times\n\n>Unless this class is a mommy or daddy yoga that advertises childcare during class time \n\nAccording to op It is listed as such. The gym ends the childcare at 12 and stops paying their staff precisely at 12 and offers a yoga class with childcare available until 12. But apparently you have to leave early because the gym won't pay their staff until the children are at least collected by the patrons who are keeping their gym in business. . That's stupid, give them time to give the children back. the gym is responsible to manage it better or don't offer it. Expecting the staff to get all the kids back and not be paid to do so isn't anyone's problem but the gyms.", "It\u2019s the gym\u2019s issue because they\u2019re the ones that create and approve the class schedules. OP stated they advertise the class as within the childcare hours so the gym should be responsible and make sure of the class consistently gets out late then it should either start 15-20 minutes earlier or they should rotate the schedule for the child care workers and have one each day that is designated (and paid for it) to stay until all the children are gone.", "half an hour seems like an extreme leeway to expect 10 minutes would be fine", "The gym has the yoga class listed under classes that align with childcare. It is their responsibility to make sure that the classes they schedule actually align with the services they provide. Ending childcare and the class at the exact same time is poor planning on the gym\u2019s part and they need to reassess the schedule.", "How is it the users' responsibility that the gym is not providing and advertised and paid for service? That's purely on the gym and the gym alone. Childcare ends half hour too early. Gym needs to fix it.", "If it is included in the price of membership, it\u2019s included in what you\u2019re paying for. It\u2019s like saying that if you pay for a gym membership that includes tanning bed access your gum isn\u2019t obligated to provide tanning bed access at no extra cost. The perks of membership is quite literally why there are memberships. Anything included in the membership is at \u201cno additional charge\u201d because it\u2019s included in the price of membership. It\u2019s not grasping at straws, it\u2019s simple logic.", "OP stated somewehre else that this particular course was listed as covered by childcare. The gym is obligated to provide what they advertized when OP made the contract.", "That would have been horrible! Employer won't pay you, but fires you for letting someone else pay you. Amazing.", "I totally agree, but also it's not unsolvable for OP if gym keeps being assholes.", "Not even remotely.\n\n30 minutes is the absolute *minumum* required.\n\nThis accounts for classes running late (it's inevitable, no matter what), and if people need to talk to the instructor. It accounts for the time required to grab your gear, to shower/change. It accounts for the time required to physically move between the instruction room, to the changerooms/lockers, and then to the childcare. It let's one do all he things they need to do *before* picking up their kids, and also leaves some extra leeway for the childcare workers.\n\n30 mins is actually cutting it pretty fine."]}
