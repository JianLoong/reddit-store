Also, books or not, no one should trash someone's property when borrowing it.", "NTA. Friends respect friends' property. Hell, decent people respect strangers' property.", "Sounds like your peer was simply upset. People get upset when they're wrong and confronted with that + the responsibility to resolve their deeds.\n\nSecondly, you can be right and a jerk at the same time. How you confront someone, how you communicate matters. So even when you're right, you can be an AH about it. (In this case, it does not sound like you were a jerk tho. Sounds like she's just upset, and that's fine. People can have emotional reactions. Just don't let it affect you and your boundaries. You are 100% in the right.\n\nI no longer lend out my tools, (or I have a spare set someone can use/destroy). They just never come back the same.", "NTA, try to find on ebay or somewhere that exact edition and version of the book and quote her with a link about why you are \"dramatic\". Also, people that do not value other people's property and not apologize/try to make up for any accident are just not to be trusted with your property ever again. You took the right measures to ensure that doesn't happen. I also suggest to send pictures of the book condition to the friends that are getting involved as they probably didn't get full info from the other side.", "NTA, I never lend my books, that's what the public library is for.", "NTA I love books and this would be an immediate end of friendship especially after her reaction.\nOne time my friend had a book of mine on a boat with her and it got wet. What did she do? Replaced the book without telling me about it and gave me both the original and new one. I didn't have to say anything.\nYou gotta respect other peoples belongings even if you don't understand/agree with the sentiment they hold.\n\nALSO HARDCOVER BOOKS ARE HECKING EXPENSIVE AND FOURTH WING IS AWESOME", "I'm sorry this happened to you! I too love my books, though only a small number of them are special edition or signed.\n\nPlease treat yourself to another copy of that book, even if your friend doesn't repay you for it.\n\nEvery time you read it, remember the hard lesson you've learned - other people, even 'friends' won't respect and take care of your things the way you do.\n\nI no longer loan anything important to me, unless it's easily and relatively inexpensively replaced - so nothing with sentimental value (like your book.) It's not worth the upset and inconvenience when it comes back damaged or not at all.\n\n100% NTA", "NTA \n\nReplace 'book' with 'car' in this scenario. Cars are just objects. There are loads of cars around, they're easy to come by. If someone had borrowed her car for nothing, returned it on the verge of collapse, and gave her grief for refusing to let them borrow the car again, I'm guessing she'd not be cool with that. \nEven if they say \"yeah,  but books are cheaper\", that's just acknowledging that there's a price threshold on being a dick. Be interesting for them to explain what the cutoff point is, and why", "NTA. She destroyed your property. Whether this was a $5 trinket from a vacation you went on or a 70\u201d flat screen, you deserve compensation for your property. This was a holiday edition. It might not be available again. Your friend is out of line. How expensive was the book? I\u2019ve seen books cost over $100. Is there an option for small claims court? Do you have texts or anything proving she acknowledged she ruined the book? She owes you big time and you\u2019re right to never give her anything to borrow. Please tell me you have a dog, borrow something of hers and play tug of war with your dog then refuse to pay. Let her taste her own medicine if she doesn\u2019t want to refund you", "NTA. Doesn't matter if it's \"just a book\" to her - she destroyed your property after saying she's take good care of it. She owes you the cost of a new holiday edition of that book. There is no question here.", "You are not in the wrong here. It's about respecting someones property. She clearly didn't do that. I would have to question your friends mentality too.", "NTA.\n\nIf it\u2019s just a book, it\u2019s just something she can pay for.", "NTA - Take a picture so if she tries to complain to mutual friends, you can just send a picture of the book.", "NTA! Borrowing items from friends is a privilege, not a right. You trusted her with one of your favourite possessions, and she broke that trust. \n\nIt's not just a book. It's YOUR book, and your books are important to you. I think how we treat other people's things reflects how much we value the person. If she respected you, she wouldn't disrespect your stuff. It doesn't matter how much an item is worth, a good friend would take good care of a _paperclip_ if they knew that paperclip belonged to a friend who cared about it.", "NTA. I don\u2019t give two squirts about books but do care about my, as well as other people\u2019s, property. I don\u2019t typically lend things out because of people like your \u201cfriend\u201d who have a complete lack of disregard for other people\u2019s property. IDK if I would have asked for the cost of the book upon return nor would have said anything at that point about any future book lends but next time she asked to borrow one I would have either asked for a deposit for the cost of the book or just simply said no at that time and refer back to this situation. The public library is free to borrow from, tell her to get a library card. As for the friends, I\u2019d ask them if she returned the book to the library like this do you think they\u2019d just ignore it?", "NTA \n\nit doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s \u2018just a book\u2019 she destroyed something that was yours, that you asked her to take care of. She\u2019s a terrible friend and your other friends are also wrong", "\u039d\u03a4\u0391, she should have at least apologised for the damage.", "NTA \n\nShe's not your friend and I wouldn't be surprised if she lied and that's why your other friends agree with her. Make sure you talk to the friends you care about and let them hear your side. I don't see how anyone would think what she did was okay in any way.", "NTA. Repeat, NTA. The \"friend\" that borrowed, and the friends that agree with her are. They do not share the same respect for other people's property as you do. \n\nI have paperbacks and hardcovers. I rarely, if ever, lend books out. The paperbacks in my library have minimal wear, and the spines have few if any creases. I lent one paperback out that I'd consider in \"very good\" condition, and the person brought it back looking \"acceptable\" with the spine all bent out of shape. When I asked about it, the person I lent it to said, \"Books are meant to be read\". \n\nRead, huh? Versus \"destroyed\"?\n\nI don't \"read\" books like that. I don't borrow from other people because I know how picky I am with my  belongings. I've also lent things and some of those items were never returned or replaced. \n\nThere's an app called Libby where you can borrow eBooks online from your local library. Or I pay for the Kindle or Google version. I've gifted the eBook versions to friends if the price is cheap enough.", "Definitely NTA. It might just be a book to them, but to you it's a hobby and a passion. With the way things are going with the digitalization of /everything/ something as simple as a book might seem trivial, but to you, it's a piece of your collection and the price of the book doesn't matter, that shit was straight up disrespectful.", "NTA - any one of these things warranted an apology and an offer to replace the book. It's not ok to return something you borrowed in that sort of condition.", "NTA, of course your are right to ask for a replacement if someone returns a book back in that condition. And if your friends all agree that it's fine to return a book that way without replacement, then you should no longer be lending books to any of them.\n\nHer dog ate it, she dropped it in the bath and she got a coffee stain on it. How did she even have the nerve to hand it back in that state without offering a replacement. What a terrible friend.", "Nope, NTA.\n\nWhen you borrow ANYTHING from anyone you return it in the same condition you received it in. Your so-called friend does NOT understand that rule, nor does she understand how to care for a book.\n\nShe owes you replacement value of the book she seriously damaged. And no, never loan her anything again. Oh, and no. A book isn\u2019t JUST a book. It\u2019s a gateway to other places, other people, other ideas. A book is a time machine and a transporter. It\u2019s a window to adventure.", "It's NOT just a book, it's a story, it's a world..  \nIt's YOURS .. that's the  point.  \nNTA .. but never lend a book to any of those who supported your 'friend' again.", "NTA\n\nIf your friend disrespects your property then you are allowed to not lend your property to them anymore. \n\nSadly I doubt that you will get the money to replace the book. And if I were you I'd decide whether the cost of the book is worth the value of the friendship. It may be worthwhile to think of the cost of the book as the cost of learning that this friend is not someone you will lend stuff to.", "If she respected you, she would have apologized immediately while handing the book back and offered to replace it. Nta", "NTA - She was extremely disrespectful but of your belongings and dismissive. You have every right to have her replace the book. She needs to take responsibility for her actions.", "Good lord, NTA. My teenage daughter borrowed a book from a friend and her water bottle leaked in her bag on it.  The friend got a replacement book and an apology, because that's what you do when you damage someone's book!!!", "Yeah, it was \"just a book\" that she returned to you in destroyed condition.  Ask her to replace it with a new holiday edition if available.  (I mean, if her dog chewed up your bag that she borrowed, she'd offer to replace it right?)  And after this, don't let people borrow your books.  The books mean too much to you, and your friends don't seem to respect that.\n\nNTA", "It is awful she did that to your book. As a friend she knew (or should have known) what your books mean to you. Even is she does not care about books herself she should have honoured your wishes. If I lend out something to someone I expect it back in the state it was when I gave it to them. Does not matter what it is. Books are precious and she should pay you back. Accidents can happen and if I accidentally wreck someone\u2019s property I would want to pay them back myself (I would offer it). But she was reckless with your book and that makes it even worse. NTA.", "NTA ! This is why I only lend my books out to a selective few . She needs to pay for the replacement ! Fellow fourth wing lover here , I\u2019d be mighty pissed off", "NTA. If your friend  can't respect your property she shouldn't borrow it. And asking to be reimbursed for a book that sounds trashed is not unreasonable.", "NTA you gave clear precise instructions and it\u2019s only good manners to look after something you borrow. She rude and ignorant", "So if you borrowed her dress and returned it ripped and stained and said 'its just a dress don't be dramatic' and offer absolutely nothing to fix she would be okay with it?

But a harsh life lesson here for you - never EVER lend anything to anyone that you\u2019re not prepared to get back damaged (if you\u2019re getting it back at all). Unfortunately, people are assholes and damage other people\u2019s property all the time or they won\u2019t care if it gets damaged. Many many many people won\u2019t care about books the way the owner cares about books too.
