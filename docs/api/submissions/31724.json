TLDR: Passive Parents made Thanksgiving Miserable.\n\nIn my family, Thanksgiving has always been \n\n- My brother and I.\n\n- My Parents/Paternal Grandparents \n\n- Aunt/Uncle/Cousin\n\n- Another Aunt and Uncle \n\n- Some More Cousins \n\n- Two Very Close Family Friends (pretty much family)\n\nMy family has always been very close. About 2 months ago or so, my grandfather passed away after a long battle with dementia and kidney issues. Needless to say my family was heartbroken and was just trying to process all of it. My grandmother and my father are still trying to process it. \n\nSo, fast forward to this Thanksgiving. Mostly the same crowd coming over to our place, except this time around we had my cousin, his wife, their two kids, and my cousin's parents come over. We always welcome extended family that we don't get to see a lot. \n\nHowever, disaster quickly struck. The kids were among the most undisciplined we have ever seen. Running all over the house, jumping on furniture, etc. Just being totally out of control. At one point, my father talks to the girl and tells her to stop climbing up on our porch railing because it could break and she could fall the 20 feet or so to the ground and hurt herself (my parents live on a mountain). The girl then proceeded to talk back with an attitude to my dad, basically refusing to stop and telling him that it won't break. So, you think the parents would be involved with disciplining their children. It was the total opposite. They were completely passive, just sitting there not even acknowledging their kids in any way. They let them do whatever with minimal consequences. Finally, THEY LEAVE FOR 2 HOURS OR SO to get some stuff for their kids from the store (they would be spending the night with my cousin's parents). When they leave, his parents do a little bit of a better job, but still very hands off. Basically put the kids in my dad's movie room alone and turned on the TV and left em down there for like 20 minutes at a time. Because of this, my older brother and his girlfriend took care of the kids begrudgingly and despised it. My dad was having to keep a constant eye on them to make sure they didn't break anything. \n\nThey finally leave, and we were exhausted and just frustrated. My mom's parents (who watch these kids all the time) couldn't believe the behavior and lack of discipline from the parents. My dad was super upset. Today, my dad said \"I didn't even get a chance to process our first Thanksgiving without my dad.\" That really just made my heart hurt. \n\nNeedless to say my father, who is 60, and my mother, who is 58, are exhausted. Overall, they just don\u2019t even want to host these kids anymore or deal with kids from that side of the family because they are just so worried it\u2019ll be the same thing over and over again. Im sure if this family finds out they\u2019ll be upset with us, but I think my parents deserve better then to be babysitters for kids they barely see and know at all. My parents are already in a massive fight against a seriously delusional, horrible, manipulative woman on the same side of the family and don\u2019t need another fight from them.

One thing I truly *despise* around family get-togethers is the fact that there's always at least one parent who thinks that the presence of multiple other adults means that it's \"get out of parenting free\" day.

It's another to completely check out and allow your kids to be disrespectful and behave recklessly. If they can't behave *when directly asked* they aren't welcome.
