You should do your tradition with the kids. Make the ornaments!  \n\nUnfortunately,.true OCD is a medical condition and your wife has little control over it.  I am glad she is getting help.\n\nWhat about getting a smaller tree each year for just the ornaments you and your kids make??", "NTA\n\nStruggling with something doesn't give you a pass and mean that everyone has to do what you want.  She doesn't get to set all of the rules.  Everything in your house doesn't have to conform to exactly what she wants.  You and your children have the right to have input and activities too.\n\nDo the activity.  If she has issues then she should call her therapist and work on it but absolutely not ruin it for the rest of you.", "NTA. Good on your wife for pursuing professional help and trying to get better but she needs to do more to make room for the 'messiness' and 'imperfections' of having kids. You aren't a jerk for wanting to start a tradition with your kids, even if it very slightly interferes with her perfect decorations. \n\nThere may be a compromise, like that you and the kids have a tree you decorate as you like and she has one she makes perfect. She does need to make room for you guys though, and not only shut down your contributions. \n\nHonestly your poor kids. I really hope you continue to insist on key improvements because they are going to be pretty effed up from walking on eggshells with your wife. Good for you for the work you've done towards that up until now.", "NTA I think your wife should work with her therapist to tolerate this for your kids sake. It sounds like she needs help managing her anger or frustration as well.\n\nAs an aside I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve tried medication but it\u2019s been as important as therapy for my daughter.", "NTA. Why does it have to be *her* vision, and *her* vision only? Last I checked, Christmas was a family affair. \n\nOur Christmas tree is a hodge podge of ornaments, many of which respresent special events or places. Love it!", "NTA - You have the right to participate and have some traditions for your family. Her illness is not an excuse to be a controlling dictator in the house. She needs to learn to let others be a part of things too. It's not just her opinion that matters.", "NTA. Your wife isn't necessarily here, but she can't let her OCD control her.  I have OCD, and there are certain things I need to do. But I also recognize that other people aren't me.  There are definitely some things to try.  Wife can help out with making the decorations. The kids could get a smaller tree that is just for their decorations. A special, magical tree to make it fun. Wife needs to learn to control and curb her OCD. It's never going to be 100% perfect. I still slip into some OCD habits when triggered. It's a day to day thing, but to function in society, I can't flip out if someone triggers my OCD. Being at home is not an excuse to stop functioning and start flipping out.  It's also kinda scary if it happens in front of the kids", "NTA.  She needs more therapy.  Her struggles shouldn't not be foisted off on the entire family.  She needs to manage her OCD and not make the household continuously suffer for it.", "NTA - whilst I understand your wife has a mental health condition, Christmas is normally about the kids. Her overdriven need for a perfect tree whilst maybe OCD driven, also seems a little bit selfish. I have goofy shit, that my son has made through the years, proudly displayed all over it! I have one friend who makes the kid hang their home made ornaments at the back, and I think this is mean as hell. I always thought OCD was about having rituals and intrusive thoughts and not being able to stop a behaviour..... not perfectionism. Although I do recognise that perfectionism can be anxiety driven, and also horrible to live with.", "NTA\n\nThe onus is on her to deal with her mental health issues. When those issues mean you can't pass on a nice family tradition to your kids simply because she has a problem, then SHE deals with it.\n\n She has more than OCD, she has entitlement and maturity issues. A reasonable person would not call you a jerk.", "NTA, but I have an idea. My aunt used to do this. She had her perfect tree in the front window,  to show off to the neighborhood. Downstairs (in the finished basement where all the parties were held) was the \"kids\" tree. One for show, one for fun.", "It sounds iffy whether your wife is healthy enough to be in a functional marriage with kids :-/", "NTA. make a separate kids tree if anything. I'm cf and I make ornaments for fun, some become stocking stuffers!", "NAH - Have you tried to include your wife in the change. She makes an ornament with the kids and you. She executes her better plan rather than you changing her existing plan.\n\nNAH, good luck with the holidays.", "NTA\n\nYour children should pamper your wife?\n\nShe is the adult!\n\nI highly recommend you think deeply about raising children with her.\n\nGrowing up walking on eggshells is not a recipe for a healthy, happy childhood.", "Nta tell her to just not look at the tree if it bothers her so much bit you and the kids are not going to shape your lives around her ocd", "NAH, and get a second tree. \n\nShe is working on her stuff, so she is not an AH for not wanting to be triggered all day, every day, by something at this stage of her recovery. \n\nBut you wanting to do a cute tradition with your kids is not an AH thing either. \n\nI\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s a bit of a control freak parent (not OCD though), and she just put her \u201cNice, grown up, pre-kids tree\u201d in one place, and bought a second tree for the kids to put tacky, brightly coloured, fun decorations on & that went in the main living space. \n\nIt helped her, to have the second tree that she chose not to consider her \u201creal\u201d tree - because she knew that it wouldn\u2019t be fair to small kids to only let them have adult decorations - but she had to look after her own mental health needs too.\n\nAs her kids got older, the youngest adopted the 2nd tree for her bedroom. Win-win, friend got the grown up tree back in the main space, and daughter got mega-Christmas in her room! They even used to open all the presents in there on Christmas morning!", "NTA, but neither is your wife, and nobody sucks here. Your wife is struggling with a mental health condition, that doesn't make her a bad person, she is seeking treatment and hopefully this is the last Christmas where you have this experience. One thought I have would be to do the Christmas ornament tradition but gift them to your mother to carry on the tradition. Rather than turn this into a battle with your wife, make it a positive experience to show your mother how much you appreciate what she had to balance and manage as a single parent. Hopefully next Christmas you can start your own tradition, while still doing it for your mother.", "NTA.\n\nAppreciate that your wife is in therapy to deal with her mental health issues, and appreciate that you want to celebrate an Xmas tradition.\n\nAs others have said, maybe you need two trees -- we have this in my family home, one for \"Martha Stewart level perfection\" and one for childhood Xmas ornaments. The kids (and OP) should not miss out on a holiday tradition because wife's OCD is challenged.\n\nYour wife might need to work harder in therapy, and you might need to get involved to ensure there's clear understanding and communication about how to work through these issues together (for the good of the marriage, and the kids). You should be able to work together to compromise on some reasonable \"family vision\" of the Christmas tree and other holiday stuff.\n\nE.g.: perhaps her trigger is symmetry, colors etc. -- compromising on ornaments that will fit the color theme or vibe and be balanced in size/shape on the tree. Not being able to make a heartfelt, handmade ornament at all = not reasonable compromise.", "While she\u2019s getting help (she should bring this issue in particular up with her therapist) would it be possible to get a miniature tree for homemade ornaments to go on? My mom loved decorating the tree exactly how she wanted it so she bought each of us kids our own small tree and each year bought us an ornament of our choice to add to it. Then when we\u2019re got married or moved out we took our tree and ornaments with us.", "NAH get counseling for your kids too.", "YTA for having children with someone who is so clearly unfit to be a parent. Your poor kids, dealing with this kind of thing every day. What were you thinking.", "NTA\n\nDo this tradition, it is a great one and will absolutely honor your mother.  Your wife needs more help if she still spirals like this, her requests are not realistic, and she is interfering with your and the children's quality of life.", "I always like my tree a specific way and when I had kids, while I love their crafts, I couldn\u2019t put them on the tree. I just got a second tree for the playroom and that\u2019s where all their crafts went. They loved having their own tree and it\u2019s the tree Santa would visit. NTA, kids should come first, but if your wife has OCD, it\u2019s not something she can help and if she is truly working on it, she\u2019s NTA either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Worked out great, her nice glass ornaments didn\u2019t get broken, and as kids we were like \u201ccool, 2 trees!\u201d", "NTA - have you attended a joint therapy session with her yet? You might consider getting a mediator or therapist for both of you and even the kids if they\u2019re getting old enough to understand and experience the consequences of her disorder. \n\nIs there a way to compromise with her on this so that you can have a fun tradition with the kids and she doesn\u2019t experience a meltdown? Maybe a second tree, a wreath, a room or corner to call yours and decorate?", "NTA. Do you have room for a second tree that is for the kids? Or maybe mini trees in their room so they can decorate?", "we always had a formal tree for pictures and parties and a kids tree in our play room and that was the tree that got all the weird vintage and homemade ornaments. its also the one we did the santa gift exchange under. they said santa put the presents under the kids tree because santa loves children most. that lil detail made us feel important. like it wasnt a junk tree it was the spirit of christmas tree. my mom put all the lights on properly how she liked then we were allowed to arrange the ornaments.\n\nso im in favor of a two tree solution.\n\nnta", "This, kids tree and \u201cwife\u2019s vision\u201d", "The kids lives shouldn\u2019t have to be shaped around her  mental health issues.", "This is how I solved my issue with that! And it worked well until my young son walked up to my tree and put his ornament that he made in school right in the middle of the tree. In that moment, looking at my son and his little ornament and how proud he was, I couldn\u2019t move it so it stayed. And each year I\u2019ve become more and more flexible and now I don\u2019t even have the \u201ckids\u201d tree up this year! OP should definitely make the ornaments with the kids and if they really need to, talk to the wife about doing a second smaller tree that the kids could decorate however they want.", "This. \n\nOP doesn't make clear if the OCD was diagnosed before or after having kids, but this should have been a very serious consideration whether to have kids at all. Kids are messy and unpredictable. \n\nRegardless, part of being a parent is dealing with life's unpredictability and messes. OP's wife probably hates suffering from her mental health condition, but the reality is that she needs to *figure out how to manage it* because that is part of her duty as a parent.", "My mother is dead", "Specifically, around her mental **illness** problems. \"Mental health\" has become a synonym and euphemism for \"mental illness.\" \n\nOP, why not start your own tradition? Put up a swag or a wreath and let everyone make an ornament for it. And as for your wife's reaction...well, OCD is of course a very real mental illness, but it's not really a get-out-of-responsibility-free card that your wife can play to emotionally blackmail you into giving her everything she wants in the way of control. \n\n*This is your home too and you have every bit as much right to say what goes in it as she does!* Remind her of this if she starts to whine, stiffen up your backbone and yes, start your own tradition with the kids.", "NTA but smaller tree for wife's vision and bigger tree that's the main event for the kids.", "I'm very sorry to learn that, and I understand why this tradition has added value to you in light of that. Is this something that should would allow you to communicate with her therapist about, in order for you to express the meaning and importance to her. This may then allow her Therapist to guide her in seeing the value to you as the most important aspect here.", "NTA but why not compromise? You can hang the hand made ornaments on a string over a window or up on a wall near the tree.", "okay while she's STILL dealing with her OCD\n\nGet a small tree for the kids' room.

You need to sack up, protect your children and take some accountability for your own life.", "NTA, I think you know that this is a very reasonable request, that\u2019s a heartwarming tradition that should not be a threat to anyone. Your wife is clearly unwell. I don\u2019t know what treatment is for OCD but it would seem like enabling to cave to her feelings on this. She is not rational and it\u2019s cruel for you and your kids to be punished essentially for existing.", "I wonder if OP's wife just talks to a therapist or goes through CBT? If she just talks to a therapist they need to change that and put her in CBT asap.\n\nShe needs to expose herself to her behaviors and fears, the family needs to stop enabling her every move because she won't get better by it.", "No, the wife should get the smaller tree since she\u2019s the one that struggles with this. The bigger tree should be the communal tree and be decorated based on the total family. NTA OP and maybe ask her therapist if she could or should just get mini versions of things that are communal so she can still have some control without it affecting the entire family. You deserve to have a say in traditions too. But it is interesting that you married her know how much she struggles in this area\u2026 I guess it\u2019s a hindsight is 20/20 thing. Good luck", "I really like that idea!\n\nEven if you don't end up putting them on the tree, it's better to make them and have them ready in case OPs wife does get to the point where they can hang them on The Main Tree.", "I'm in treatment for OCD right now, and I agree with this comment.", "But they will be, so let's look at this practically.
