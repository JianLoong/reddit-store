He loved his cat dearly but whenever I visited it was clear he was pretty relaxed with daily care.  Liter box was constantly disgusting and changed maybe once every few weeks.  Sox was left out a whole bag of kibble to eat on and often it would go stale with ants and Sox would refused to eat.  \n\nWe ended up getting a place together and immediately Sox became my responsibility.  Liter box, feeding, vet visits.  99% me \n\nI became pregnant back in March and could no longer clean Sox\u2019s liter box.  My boyfriend did for maybe 3 weeks but then he stopped. I ended up hiring my 11-year-old nephew to help. \n\nOn July 5th we woke up to find Sox VERY sick.  He had been vomiting more than usual for the past few days and had an accident in our office.  He was sleeping and would not wake up.  We rushed him to the emergency vet where he was diagnosed with late stage heart failure.  We were then given the option to put him down now then or treat him.  My boyfriend chose to treat him.  He was given an ACE inhibitors and fluids and stayed in the emergency vet for 4 days before being released.  Surgery was not an option.\n\nSince picking up Sox he had been a miserable, sickly cat.  Our vet gave us pills to manage his pain that has him sleeping all day, constantly drooling, not eating and nonstop accidents.\n\nTwo weeks ago I told my boyfriend that Sox really needed to be put down because his quality of life was so low.  It was physically painful for me to see him so sick.  I was still providing all care as my boyfriend avoided him altogether because it was too upsetting.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t want to put him down at the vets but would take him to his dads to put him down \u201cthe old fashion way\u201d.  I said fine, do what you need to do.  He kept putting it off and putting it off. \n\nIt became very clear this cat was dying and dying slowly and I couldn\u2019t take it.  On Friday I told my boyfriend Sox needed to be put down this weekend or I was taking him in Monday.  He got upset and left without Sox.   So I set up an appointment for Monday and texted my boyfriend the time.  No response. \n\nI took off work Monday morning.  Called my boyfriend again and told him the appointment time.  No response.\n\nI gave Sox his last meal, an extra large dose of pain meds and drove him to the vet where he peacefully passed away with by his side.   I texted my boyfriend he had died and immediately got an angry call.\n\nHe said a lot of terribly hurtful things.  I was hurt and crying but knew he was speaking from grief so let him say what needed to be said\n\nMy boyfriend returned Tuesday night and has refused to talk to me.  \n\nIn my heart, I know I did the right thing by Sox.  But I think I did the wrong thing by my boyfriend and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll ever forgive me. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1690599030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cgyaq/aita_for_putting_my_boyfriends_cat_down_without/", "score": 2939, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend was shirking his responsibilities and you stepped up.  Poor cat was put through hell because of it.  Also, the fact that he got upset about what you told him you would do, and then abandoned his cat knowing what you would do, makes him a horrible pet owner.  If he really cared about the cat's wellbeing he would have taken the cat with him.  He may just have not wanted to face the reality of losing his longtime pet, but this is an unfortunate part of ownership.  You give them a good life, but it will always be shorter than you like.  16 years is a good life for a cat.  You did the right thing.", "NTA\u2026 seriously why are you with this person? \nHow do you think he will respond when the baby needs a diaper change? Or worse if you or baby are seriously ill? \nAnyone who treats his pet so badly and with this much neglect is not going to be a good partner or parent. \nBF needs to grow up", "NTA You were clearly the caretaker for this cat and were putting its needs first. You communicated the need to take action and continued to try to reach out so he could be present.  Also, the \"old fashioned\" way is much less kind than the peaceful passing the vet gives. What if it wasn't  a clean shot?", "NTA what you did was very compassionate for a suffering pet. boyfriend on the other hand ignored reality and you both suffered for it. i'm so sorry you had to go through that. you definitely did right by Sox and he's happy at the rainbow bridge.", "I dread the days I lose my two little ones with all my heart, but it's a grief I willingly accepted when I adopted them. They've not spent a single day wanting for anything and, when the time comes, I will endeavor to facilitate their passing as smoothly, painlessly and humanely as possible.\n\nYour bf on the other hand was pretending the situation didn't exist and instead was going to either let his beloved cat suffer to death or take him out back and shoot him?

You totally did the right thing, even though it was super tough, because your boyfriend wasn't even taking good care of Sox before he got diagnosed with heart failure. Giving him up to someone else who could be there for him 24/7 might've been an option, but honestly, his quality of life wasn't great to begin with. So yeah, I think you made the smart call.", "RIP  \n\nSox", "NTA\n\nIn this case you did the right thing.

He couldn't get over the fact it had to happen. I'm already preparing for my kitty to pass, have the number and plan so I don't have to suffer the logistics when it unfortunately will happen one day. She's completely healthy currently. I already know I more than likely will have to make the decision to bring her in and will have to live with that.", "NTA. I get he was grieving, but you gave your BF multiple opportunities to make decisions that were in the best interest of the cat and he refused to acknowledge the cat or its suffering. \n\nI hate to bring this up, but what\u2019s going to happen when you two disagree on something with the baby? Is he going to ignore issues/responsibility, pin everything on you, and then verbally berate you (sinking to low blows about not having a child with you and how you\u2019ll be a bad mom) like he did with this situation?", "I say NTA. It sounds like he was in denial of the reality of the animal's situation, and he didn't want to face what it meant, hence the putting it off. It seemed like you actually cared about the animal's welfare, and had always done so.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend though is TA because of the following:\n\n- horrible attitude towards Sox's care, leading to a demise filled with suffering for no reason other than his own selfishness.\n\n- putting you and your unborn baby at risk.\n\n- being a bad, lazy partner and making all of the work associated with Sox your job. I'd take this as an insight into what kind of father he will be.\n\n- whatever he said to you after you did the right thing.\n\n- his suggestion to kill Sox the \"old-fashioned\" way. WTF. \n\nBasically, I'd be getting out of that relationship as fast as possible.", "NTA. I was ready to go the other way because I was thinking 'without his permission' meant 'without his knowledge.'\n\nYou did right by the cat. You did good. Could have and probably should have been done sooner but you did what you could, I think.\n\nPersonally, IIWY, I would be rethinking the relationship. For me, how a person treats their pets/animals is a huge indicator of their character. And your BFs behavior isn't painting him in a very good light.", "NTA, but he has shown he can't take care of a cat and you're expecting him to step up for a mentally, physically, emotionally and financially draining human life? *bombastic side eye*\n\nPrepare yourself to be a single mum in a relationship", "NTA. The two weeks notice is what tells us that OP did the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing for Sox. You\u2019re boyfriend, though is an AH for not taking proper care, and not being with him at the end.", "NTA, but this is tricky. You did right by the cat. And even with your boyfriend, you gave a deadline. When it was passing, you set up an appointment and gave him the time. He had every chance to resolve this himself or be there when you did. He was obviously not capable of handling the situation, and it was hard not being involved in the decision. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m actually going to guess there is a part of him that is relieved he did not have to be there. Not everyone can handle that. I bet there\u2019s a part of him that feels bad he wasn\u2019t able to do what was needed. It is not fair he\u2019s taking it out on you. He\u2019s grieving and can clearly use the space, but the two of you will need to work through this at some point. He can\u2019t keep on blaming you, or there will be a resentment that can\u2019t be erased.", "Info: what exactly is \"the old fashioned way\"?", "NTA.

Neither option was great but one meant the animal would no longer be in pain.\n\nYour boyfriend's other comment about doing it \"the old fashioned way\" betrays to me something of an \"old school\" mentality about this sort of thing which to me is more evidence that he just didn't want to accept what had to happen.\n\nI hope you and he cab communicate about this and move past it, but being able to deal with undesirable consequences is an important part of life and working together in relationships.", "You didn\u2019t betray him so much as he betrayed Sox and you picked up the slack.

I am taking everything at face value here but based on everything you said, your boyfriend is a horrible human.\n\n1. Your boyfriend just seemed to not care at all about caring for him - he's the asshole\n\n2. He was clearly in denial over everything, which, I get. When you spoke to him about putting down Sox, you explained that it made you physically ill to see him like that but you didn't really try to empathize with him based on your story about what he was experiencing. This may have been easier if you guys attempted to talk through it more. I understand it's difficult and he may not be receptive at first but, I personally would have worked harder at this. - You're both assholes for failing to find ways to effectively communicate but still, mostly him\n\n3. While I understand your decision and don't even necessarily think it's the wrong one, putting down Sox without one final conversation or some closure for your boyfriend will probably haunt him for years. I don't think you were wrong but had it been me, knowing I had pain meds, I would have waited. I don't fault you here and your boyfriend is still the asshole but it absolutely causes some level of trauma.\n\nHonestly, there are points throughout your relationship that the both of you needed to develop better communication and that falls to the both of you. You are about to have a kid. You need to sort through this for the sake of your child or decide to split.

Do you honestly think he will be there for you and your child when he couldn't be damned to clean the damn litter box for both you and Sox? \n\nHere's what needs to happen: \n\n1. You need to have him apologize to you for his behavior. His treatment of you because you did right by your cat (at this point, Sox WAS YOUR CAT) is unacceptable\n2. He needs to go to individual therapy and you both need to go to couples counseling to figure out a co-parenting arrangement that will work for both of you while he's in recovery\n3. You do not let him have any future pets until the baby is much, much older. And do not ever, EVER, leave him home alone with the baby until he proves he can actually take care of it.\n4. You need to figure out what you're going to do in case things don't get better. Have plans in place for child care, finances, and legal issues. \n\nOpen your eyes OP. This behavior is not right. \n\nNTA for doing right by your cat. And I am so, so sorry for your loss. \n\nBut you need to listen. Something is off with your boyfriend and has been for a while. And whatever it is needs to be nipped in the bud now.", "That is a lot of words for emotionally immature.

She put off putting down her dog for two extra days - not weeks. She asked me to make the call to arrange it, because she knew she\u2019d chicken out.

I took her back to their house where she was born.  She loved it there. It was sunny and warm and she laid in the green grass where my stepdad quickly shot her.

Brother got him on his first day of kindergarten(age 5) and he's about to start his second year of college(he's 19). And Taco(a chihuahua, go figure letting a 5 year old name him lol) was already at least a year old when he was adopted. A couple months ago we had to rush Taco to the emergency vet because he was throwing up dark mucus. He'd seemed perfectly fine the day before. My brother had spent the night with a friend and wasn't with us, but we called him on the way. When we got to speak to the vet after the exam and tests, it wasn't good news: diabetic ketoacidosis and severe anemia(blood count at 14; normal is in the 50s, transfusions recommended at 20). Taco was in pain and while he could be treated for both conditions, treating them simultaneously would put a lot of stress on him and wasn't guaranteed to work(he'd have to be kept at the hospital for at least a week and we couldn't really visit him). So we tried to call my brother to get him to the vet, but he wouldn't puck up. We both felt awful making the call without my brother there, because Taco had always been his dog, but we agreed it would be cruel to let him keep suffering, and with treatment having a less than 30% success chance with both conditions combined(vet said if it was either alone, it'd be a 90% success chance, but both together tanks his chances), we opted to put him down. \n\nIt was heartbreaking and I still regret not having my little brother there to hold his dog as he passed, but it was what was best for Taco.\n\nYou made the call on what was best for Sox, and I know it feels rotten, but Sox's comfort needed to be the priority.
