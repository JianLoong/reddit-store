He loved his cat dearly but whenever I visited it was clear he was pretty relaxed with daily care.  Liter box was constantly disgusting and changed maybe once every few weeks.  Sox was left out a whole bag of kibble to eat on and often it would go stale with ants and Sox would refused to eat.  \n\nWe ended up getting a place together and immediately Sox became my responsibility.  Liter box, feeding, vet visits.  99% me \n\nI became pregnant back in March and could no longer clean Sox\u2019s liter box.  My boyfriend did for maybe 3 weeks but then he stopped. I ended up hiring my 11-year-old nephew to help. \n\nOn July 5th we woke up to find Sox VERY sick.  He had been vomiting more than usual for the past few days and had an accident in our office.  He was sleeping and would not wake up.  We rushed him to the emergency vet where he was diagnosed with late stage heart failure.  We were then given the option to put him down now then or treat him.  My boyfriend chose to treat him.  He was given an ACE inhibitors and fluids and stayed in the emergency vet for 4 days before being released.  Surgery was not an option.\n\nSince picking up Sox he had been a miserable, sickly cat.  Our vet gave us pills to manage his pain that has him sleeping all day, constantly drooling, not eating and nonstop accidents.\n\nTwo weeks ago I told my boyfriend that Sox really needed to be put down because his quality of life was so low.  It was physically painful for me to see him so sick.  I was still providing all care as my boyfriend avoided him altogether because it was too upsetting.\n\nHe said he didn\u2019t want to put him down at the vets but would take him to his dads to put him down \u201cthe old fashion way\u201d.  I said fine, do what you need to do.  He kept putting it off and putting it off. \n\nIt became very clear this cat was dying and dying slowly and I couldn\u2019t take it.  On Friday I told my boyfriend Sox needed to be put down this weekend or I was taking him in Monday.  He got upset and left without Sox.   So I set up an appointment for Monday and texted my boyfriend the time.  No response. \n\nI took off work Monday morning.  Called my boyfriend again and told him the appointment time.  No response.\n\nI gave Sox his last meal, an extra large dose of pain meds and drove him to the vet where he peacefully passed away with by his side.   I texted my boyfriend he had died and immediately got an angry call.\n\nHe said a lot of terribly hurtful things.  I was hurt and crying but knew he was speaking from grief so let him say what needed to be said\n\nMy boyfriend returned Tuesday night and has refused to talk to me.  \n\nIn my heart, I know I did the right thing by Sox.  But I think I did the wrong thing by my boyfriend and I\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll ever forgive me. \n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1690599030, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cgyaq/aita_for_putting_my_boyfriends_cat_down_without/", "score": 125, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your boyfriend was shirking his responsibilities and you stepped up.  Poor cat was put through hell because of it.  Also, the fact that he got upset about what you told him you would do, and then abandoned his cat knowing what you would do, makes him a horrible pet owner.  If he really cared about the cat's wellbeing he would have taken the cat with him.  He may just have not wanted to face the reality of losing his longtime pet, but this is an unfortunate part of ownership.  You give them a good life, but it will always be shorter than you like.  16 years is a good life for a cat.  You did the right thing.", "NTA\u2026 seriously why are you with this person? \nHow do you think he will respond when the baby needs a diaper change? Or worse if you or baby are seriously ill? \nAnyone who treats his pet so badly and with this much neglect is not going to be a good partner or parent. \nBF needs to grow up", "NTA You were clearly the caretaker for this cat and were putting its needs first. You communicated the need to take action and continued to try to reach out so he could be present.  Also, the \"old fashioned\" way is much less kind than the peaceful passing the vet gives. What if it wasn't  a clean shot?", "NTA what you did was very compassionate for a suffering pet. boyfriend on the other hand ignored reality and you both suffered for it. i'm so sorry you had to go through that. you definitely did right by Sox and he's happy at the rainbow bridge.", "I dread the days I lose my two little ones with all my heart, but it's a grief I willingly accepted when I adopted them. They've not spent a single day wanting for anything and, when the time comes, I will endeavor to facilitate their passing as smoothly, painlessly and humanely as possible.\n\nYour bf on the other hand was pretending the situation didn't exist and instead was going to either let his beloved cat suffer to death or take him out back and shoot him? Really? That's fucking gruesome and vile.\n\nNTA\n\nYes, he's grieving, and he might not forgive you, but you absolutely did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nThat's the hardest, saddest thing for us pet ownees to do, even when it's the obviously right thing.  I feel your pain, having gone through it many times.", "Yes and no\n\nYou did the right thing by the cat, and I appreciate that.

That\u2019s a big warning sign that he will avoid responsibility and you\u2019ll be stuck doing every difficult thing in the relationship.", "NTA. You totally did the right thing, even though it was super tough, because your boyfriend wasn't even taking good care of Sox before he got diagnosed with heart failure. Giving him up to someone else who could be there for him 24/7 might've been an option, but honestly, his quality of life wasn't great to begin with. So yeah, I think you made the smart call.", "RIP  \n\nSox", "NTA\n\nIn this case you did the right thing.

I\u2019d personally need to rethink this new personality trait he\u2019s just revealed.", "NTA. Your boyfriend is acting like a child.  This is not how you treat animals you supposedly love.  Are you sure you want to raise a baby with him? He clearly won't do what needs to be done in a medical emergency.  What if your kid falls or breaks a bone while in his care? Is he just going to run away and make the kid wait until you handle it?", "Nta. You did everything you could. The cat was suffering and he didn't wanna deal with that. That's on him.", "I went into this already in a rage, ready to flame YTA from the title.

He couldn't get over the fact it had to happen. I'm already preparing for my kitty to pass, have the number and plan so I don't have to suffer the logistics when it unfortunately will happen one day. She's completely healthy currently. I already know I more than likely will have to make the decision to bring her in and will have to live with that.", "NTA. I get he was grieving, but you gave your BF multiple opportunities to make decisions that were in the best interest of the cat and he refused to acknowledge the cat or its suffering. \n\nI hate to bring this up, but what\u2019s going to happen when you two disagree on something with the baby? Is he going to ignore issues/responsibility, pin everything on you, and then verbally berate you (sinking to low blows about not having a child with you and how you\u2019ll be a bad mom) like he did with this situation?", "I say NTA. It sounds like he was in denial of the reality of the animal's situation, and he didn't want to face what it meant, hence the putting it off. It seemed like you actually cared about the animal's welfare, and had always done so.", "NTA.\n\nYour boyfriend though is TA because of the following:\n\n- horrible attitude towards Sox's care, leading to a demise filled with suffering for no reason other than his own selfishness.\n\n- putting you and your unborn baby at risk.\n\n- being a bad, lazy partner and making all of the work associated with Sox your job. I'd take this as an insight into what kind of father he will be.\n\n- whatever he said to you after you did the right thing.\n\n- his suggestion to kill Sox the \"old-fashioned\" way. WTF. \n\nBasically, I'd be getting out of that relationship as fast as possible.", "NTA. I was ready to go the other way because I was thinking 'without his permission' meant 'without his knowledge.'\n\nYou did right by the cat. You did good. Could have and probably should have been done sooner but you did what you could, I think.\n\nPersonally, IIWY, I would be rethinking the relationship. For me, how a person treats their pets/animals is a huge indicator of their character. And your BFs behavior isn't painting him in a very good light.", "NTA, but he has shown he can't take care of a cat and you're expecting him to step up for a mentally, physically, emotionally and financially draining human life? *bombastic side eye*\n\nPrepare yourself to be a single mum in a relationship", "NTA. The two weeks notice is what tells us that OP did the right thing.", "NTA. You did the right thing for Sox. You\u2019re boyfriend, though is an AH for not taking proper care, and not being with him at the end.", "NTA, but this is tricky. You did right by the cat. And even with your boyfriend, you gave a deadline. When it was passing, you set up an appointment and gave him the time. He had every chance to resolve this himself or be there when you did. He was obviously not capable of handling the situation, and it was hard not being involved in the decision. \n\nHowever, I\u2019m actually going to guess there is a part of him that is relieved he did not have to be there. Not everyone can handle that. I bet there\u2019s a part of him that feels bad he wasn\u2019t able to do what was needed. It is not fair he\u2019s taking it out on you. He\u2019s grieving and can clearly use the space, but the two of you will need to work through this at some point. He can\u2019t keep on blaming you, or there will be a resentment that can\u2019t be erased.", "Info: what exactly is \"the old fashioned way\"?", "NTA.

If he wasn't going to take responsibility for relieving the animal's suffering it wouldn't make sense for you to have to keep being its caretaker. But I doubt you would have felt better about this scenario. Neither option was great but one meant the animal would no longer be in pain.\n\nYour boyfriend's other comment about doing it \"the old fashioned way\" betrays to me something of an \"old school\" mentality about this sort of thing which to me is more evidence that he just didn't want to accept what had to happen.\n\nI hope you and he cab communicate about this and move past it, but being able to deal with undesirable consequences is an important part of life and working together in relationships.", "You didn\u2019t betray him so much as he betrayed Sox and you picked up the slack.

I am taking everything at face value here but based on everything you said, your boyfriend is a horrible human.\n\n1. Your boyfriend just seemed to not care at all about caring for him - he's the asshole\n\n2. He was clearly in denial over everything, which, I get. When you spoke to him about putting down Sox, you explained that it made you physically ill to see him like that but you didn't really try to empathize with him based on your story about what he was experiencing. This may have been easier if you guys attempted to talk through it more. I understand it's difficult and he may not be receptive at first but, I personally would have worked harder at this. - You're both assholes for failing to find ways to effectively communicate but still, mostly him\n\n3. While I understand your decision and don't even necessarily think it's the wrong one, putting down Sox without one final conversation or some closure for your boyfriend will probably haunt him for years. I don't think you were wrong but had it been me, knowing I had pain meds, I would have waited. I don't fault you here and your boyfriend is still the asshole but it absolutely causes some level of trauma.\n\nHonestly, there are points throughout your relationship that the both of you needed to develop better communication and that falls to the both of you. You are about to have a kid. You need to sort through this for the sake of your child or decide to split. But him saying the things he's saying are not acceptable by any standard, idgaf about grief. \"you will be a terrible mother\" are not words that can ever come out of his mouth if you are to have a successful life together and if you want that, please put your foot down and tell him to shut the fuck up and get his shit together.", "YTA\n\nSox wasn't your cat and I hope you know that you violated your boyfriend's trust in a major way.

My boyfriend did for maybe 3 weeks but then he stopped. I ended up hiring my 11-year-old nephew to help.  \n>  \n>He said he didn\u2019t want to put him down at the vets but would take him to his dads to put him down \u201cthe old fashion way\u201d.   \n>  \n>He kept putting it off and putting it off.\n\nSweetheart, listen to me. I'm a cat owner. This behavior is not the behavior of a good man. This is the behavior of someone who was not ready and should not ever have pets. EVER. \n\n**What he did regarding Sox's care was neglect.** If someone had called animal services, he could have gotten a fine at best, or a criminal charge at worst. \n\nLet that sink in: ***What your boyfriend did to that cat could. Have. Potentially. Landed. Him. In. JAIL.***\n\nIf this is how he was with his pet, how do you expect him to be able to handle a child? Do you honestly think he will be there for you and your child when he couldn't be damned to clean the damn litter box for both you and Sox? \n\nHere's what needs to happen: \n\n1. You need to have him apologize to you for his behavior. His treatment of you because you did right by your cat (at this point, Sox WAS YOUR CAT) is unacceptable\n2. He needs to go to individual therapy and you both need to go to couples counseling to figure out a co-parenting arrangement that will work for both of you while he's in recovery\n3. You do not let him have any future pets until the baby is much, much older. And do not ever, EVER, leave him home alone with the baby until he proves he can actually take care of it.\n4. You need to figure out what you're going to do in case things don't get better. Have plans in place for child care, finances, and legal issues. \n\nOpen your eyes OP. This behavior is not right. \n\nNTA for doing right by your cat. And I am so, so sorry for your loss. \n\nBut you need to listen. Something is off with your boyfriend and has been for a while. And whatever it is needs to be nipped in the bud now.", "That is a lot of words for emotionally immature. I know it\u2019s easier to look for the best in the people you love, but this is a huge problem for any potential future you have together. He will not be there to support you when things get rough. He\u2019s old enough to recognize he needs to develop less destructive coping mechanisms. Not dealing with it is not an okay way to deal with difficult emotional issues. It\u2019s frankly alarming he mentioned \u2018the old fashioned way\u2019. I can\u2019t even fathom killing an animal I love by physically destroying them while they are CONSCIOUS. That\u2019s absolutely insane and the fact his mind went there as better than a humane euthanasia by a professional is mega concerning.", "I\u2019m an extremely sensitive person. I haven\u2019t had the greatest home life and my pets are my family. I was the one to do the research and \u201cpull the trigger\u201d each time. And I was there until the last breath. That is what you promise your let\u2019s by taking them in and prolonging their life. We take on their pain to let them go peacefully.\n\nMy mom is the type that deals with things by denial. She put off putting down her dog for two extra days - not weeks. She asked me to make the call to arrange it, because she knew she\u2019d chicken out. That kind of thing is fine and to be expected. \n\nThis is him being so unable to deal with life he would rather see someone he loves suffer than suffer himself.", "Well no, you said he cleaned his cat\u2019s litter box every few weeks and couldn\u2019t be bothered to even put the cat food in a bowl! Like that was too much effort. Letting the cat eat out of a bag with ants and stale food. Really please tell us again how great he is. Seriously good luck parenting with him.", "The fact that he\u2019s speaking to you in an emotionally abusive way and you\u2019re still questioning whether YOU\u2019RE the asshole has me very concerned for you. \n\nIf he truly believed that it wasn\u2019t his cat\u2019s time yet (whether or not that was actually the reality), then his duty as that cat\u2019s guardian would have been to get the cat the hell away from you once you had informed him of your intention to have the cat put to sleep. He chose not to intervene despite having multiple chances to do so. \n\nHe can\u2019t have it both ways. He wants to both allow you to end the cat\u2019s suffering and to punish and blame you for having done it. I understand he\u2019s in pain and grieving but it\u2019s unacceptable for him to use his distress as an excuse to attack your character and try to make you feel small and guilty. \n\nThank you for having the courage to give Sox a peaceful passing \u2014 all the more courageous given that you probably knew the backlash you were going to face for it. You did the right thing. In the vet world we say \u201cbetter a day too early than a day too late\u201d, and it sounds as though it was already much later than it should have been for him. He\u2019s lucky you were there to care for him, both at the end of his life and for the last 7 years. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to make an amazing mother.", "Please break up with him and not let him be alone with your child", "Hun, you did the right thing. You made the hard choice that had to be made. The cat wasn\u2019t ever going to get better, he was going to die no matter what and it was going to hurt right up until the end. I say this as a rescue volunteer who has seen a lot of rough cases. I do have to say that I\u2019m a bit worried about you and the situation you\u2019re in. What he\u2019s saying to you is not okay. You seem bright enough and strong enough to make the right choice for you and your baby to have an awesome life. \n\nNTA", "Hon, your partner left piles of poop in that litter box and couldn\u2019t be bothered to scoop food, not caring if the cat actually got enough food once it went bad. \n\nWhat do you think is going to happen when the novelty of caring for a _baby_ wears off?\n\nYou cared for that cat wonderfully and he didn\u2019t take any care of the cat. You have already stepped up to mothering. I would not ever leave my baby alone with him, on the other hand\u2014he should take a hard look at whether he will be a terrible father. I hope he\u2019s not, but he definitely has a LOT of nerve saying this to you. \n\nNTA and I hope he gets the therapy he needs if you stay.", "Wow. Do you even want his kid? This is unreal", "OP, my heart is breaking for you. I know this is going to be very hard to hear but I've been with my husband since I was 19 and that was well over 25 years ago. Can I have had crazy screaming fights, big blow ups over huge and small things over the years, and he has never EVER said anything like that to me. That is not what a sensitive man says. And failing to feed or provide proper care for a cat is not what a sensitive man does\n\nYou did right by your cat now do right by yourself and your baby.  And to be honest, if this is any indication you are going to be a great mother. You've had to make really hard decisions and I think you know what decision you have to make here.", "Ok now he's just being straight up verbally abusive. Take steps to get out of the relationship. May I ask if he's controlling?", "OP that's fucking awful", ">Told me he regrets getting me pregnant and that I\u2019ll be a terrible mother.\n\nTime to get out, OP.\n\nThat is ***NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER*** an ok thing to say to the partner you are supposed to love.  Ever.  I don't care how angry or hurt he is.  Those words should have never left his mouth.\n\nHe is showing you who he is.  Believe him and protect yourself.  He is abusive and, by the sounds of it, negligent, inconsiderate, and lazy.   Please don't subject yourself to anymore of that, and especially don't let your child become a victim of his nonsense.", "This is what I was thinking. How is he even going to help with a sick kid??", "If you want to be squeezed in for a same day appointment you have to call the vet immediately after opening or go to an ER vet. Many practices are closed over the weekend and on holidays, as are shelters- and the ER vet is $160 just to walk in the door.\n\nI have a very medically....fragile cat. When he gets sick again I'm looking at somewhere between $2000-$5000 on emergency surgery. I lost his brother under anesthesia for it a month to the day he started displaying symptoms.   \nCash up front.\n\nIf you don't have the money or you can't get an appointment and the animal is legitimately suffering a short painful death is kinder than a slow and painful one- they deserve an owner who does what they have to do to minimize their suffering as much as possible.", "The old fashioned way is absolutely a gun.  Some guys were going to do that to our old warehouse cat that had been a faithful ratter for 10 years and was now old and slow and skinny.  Instead I stole him home and he got to live as a retired house cat for 2 years, eating canned food.", "That or breaking it's poor neck. He's also probably a cheapskate who didn't want to pay the vet bill.", "I agree. A quick gunshot given by a familiar person in calm setting is something that does not bother me one bit.   \n\n\nLast December my beloved 16 year old cat's time was up. It was, of course, a Saturday afternoon. There are no vets open near me and the closest emergency vet is a 1.5 hour drive. It was her time, she was suffering so I asked my parents to help. I took her back to their house where she was born.  She loved it there. It was sunny and warm and she laid in the green grass where my stepdad quickly shot her. She did not have a stressful drive to a loud clinic, she didn't have to suffer for two days waiting for an appointment. It was awful, but the very best choice I could have made for her at the time.", "In my mind, there\u2019s a fine line. I get delaying it for a couple days while you say your goodbyes and spend your final moments with them (and maybe hope that they miraculously get better), but letting them suffer for weeks on end is not ok. And the latter clearly happened in this scenario. \n\nAs to your emotional intelligence point, straight men tend to struggle in that regard.", "I don't think it's normal. It's pretty common to get a pet in your twenties which means by mid to late thirties, most people have had to go through this. Of all the male friends I've had, they have all navigated this kind of situation the way you would expect - they grieve but they are able to take care of the pet and arrange to have them compassionately put down and to be there for it. Most of them have kids so they also have comforted others in their family through the same process at the same time.", "Yep, he's projecting.", "I know and pregnant women aren't supposed to clean litter boxes because of the risk of toxoplasmosis", "Great question.  She apparently doesn't want a safe, happy baby as much as she wants to keep this \"good guy\" by her side.", "You\u2019re a good human!!! \ud83d\ude3a", "That comforting. Thank you. Sometimes Reddit has me ready to give up on humanity."]}
