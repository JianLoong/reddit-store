My mom was still invited to our wedding, but from the moment she arrived she couldn\u2019t stop making totally inappropriate remarks about \u201cslaves\u201d and \u201csecond world countries\u201d which made everyone super uncomfortable.\n\nMy wife was in tears and told me my mom ruined the wedding and I was completely with her on that. I cut my mom out of my life after that day and we haven\u2019t spoken since. I\u2019ve now been with my wife for almost 30 years and we have a daughter together who is getting engaged soon to a lovely young man that happens to be of african-american descent.\n\nDespite my strained relationship with my mom, my dad has always been an active part of my life. Unlike my mom, he has never treated my family any differently because of how they look and has even helped raise my daughter over the years, who he adores and is very close with, and has a great relationship with my future son-in-law. I invited him to my daughter\u2019s wedding, but not my mom, for obvious reasons.\n\nUnfortunately, my dad isn\u2019t great at keeping secrets, and the very next day my mom showed up, unsolicited, at my front door. I hadn\u2019t seen her since my wedding and I told her to get off my property or I\u2019d call the cops. She begged me to listen to her and how she was a changed woman, and just wanted to be there for her granddaughter (who she has never once visited). Funnily enough, she never mentioned or apologised for ruining my wedding and offending my wife\u2019s entire family.\n\nI told her absolutely no way she was going to be allowed at my daughter\u2019s wedding and if she tried to visit my house again I would get a restraining order against her. My dad called me afterwards and said that I was too harsh and that I should give her a second chance. He said this could be a good opportunity for my wife and I to \u201creconnect\u201d with my mom, which I found pretty insulting.\n\nI was really upset that he took her side, considering what she\u2019s done and how she\u2019s acted in the past. Also, the only way my mom would\u2019ve known where I live is if my dad told her, and for her to show up uninvited means that he didn\u2019t stop her from going to my house. I told my dad he wasn\u2019t welcome at the wedding anymore.\n\nI\u2019m afraid that my dad is going to try and bring my mom if we let him come, and I\u2019m not convinced my mom has changed. Especially since she hasn\u2019t even acknowledged what she did to us. But my wife told me I was wrong to uninvite my dad, and that our daughter will be really disappointed if her grandpa isn\u2019t going to be there. She also said that both of her parents will be there and it will be weird if neither of mine are present. I do feel like maybe I was too unfair on my dad but I really really do not want my mom to ruin my daughter\u2019s wedding like she ruined mine.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674392375, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ij4hm/aita_for_telling_my_parents_they_arent_allowed_to/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Have a discussion with her about your concerns of him being there and the potentiality of your mom crashing the wedding/reception. I would also step up and pay for a security guard at the wedding and reception if you can afford it.  I\u2019m so glad your dad has had a relationship with your daughter.  I don\u2019t know how he could keep news like this away from your mom since I assume they live together? Or are they divorced?\nEdit to add: NTA, but let your daughter decide.", "NTA. A major public life event is not the right venue for reconnecting after a serious harm followed by thirty years of no contact. If your mom was truly committed to repairing harm, she should do so by respecting your wishes and asking you whether/when/how you want to explore reconnecting (emphasis on whether). \n\nThat said, I agree with others that it's your daughter's decision to make about inviting your dad. Have you had a conversation with your dad about his role in your mom showing up, and how that affected your trust in him?", "NTA, not even close. Your Mom is the asshole in the situation, not you. You may want to consider setting up a time for your Mom to meet your kiddo to work on building that relationship if your daughter wants to pursue it. I definitely could see how this situation is difficult for your Dad. I'm sure he didn't do anything intentionally to hurt you, its probably coming from a good place in his heart. \n\nWith that said, I fully support your decision to not let your Mom come to your kids wedding. That's a natural, logical consequence to the hell she rained down on your wedding. \n\nAllow her a 2nd chance to have a relationship with your kid? Sure. Invite her to dinner, to a birthday party, out hiking. But dont invite her to the wedding.", "NTA. If she had changed. She would have picked up the phone before now and called you.\n\nYour dad has done well at keeping the things separate and staying involved with you. She probably overwhelmed him and got him to give up now. Dont hate him too much. It's tough living with the evil partner.", "Info: what is your daughter\u2019s opinion in all this? It\u2019s her and her so\u2019s wedding", "You should talk to your dad about your mom not apologizing or even acknowledging what she did. That being said, it is your daughters decision on who will attend HER wedding. If she decides she wants one or both of them there, you all should respect that. Im going to go with NAH for now.", "NTA.\n\nBased on the information provided, it seems that you have valid reasons for not wanting your mother to attend your daughter's wedding. She has shown a pattern of inappropriate behavior and has never apologized for her actions at your own wedding. You have also had a strained relationship with her for many years.\n\nHowever, it is understandable that your wife and daughter may be disappointed if your father is not able to attend the wedding. It is important to consider their feelings and the impact it may have on them.\n\nIt may be worth having a conversation with your father about your concerns and setting clear boundaries for your mother's involvement in the wedding. It could also be beneficial for you and your wife to have a conversation with your daughter about the situation and explain why you made the decision you did.\n\nIn this situation, it may be difficult to please everyone, but it is important to prioritize the safety and comfort of yourself, your wife, and your daughter on your daughter's special day. Ultimately, the decision is between you, your wife, and most importantly, your daughter, and you are not necessarily in the wrong for standing up for yourself and your family.", "NTA. Ultimately your daughter\u2019s choice but if your mother really wanted to reconnect then a big family event isn\u2019t the time to do that. You and your daughter won\u2019t be sitting around twiddling your thumbs that day, you\u2019ll both be fairly well occupied. \n\nIf she really has changed the better approach would be to ask to meet for coffee or other low pressure option. If she is serious about fixing things then she should be happy to take whatever opportunity you give her on your terms.", ". [Edited]\n\nINFO: why don't you let your daughter decide? She is old enough to get married. Shouldn't she be old enough to decide who is invited to HER wedding?\n\nDoes she know what your mom did? And that your dad enabled her to break the NC?", "Info: How is it not your daughter's choice who comes to her wedding?", "Soft YTA. Your dad has spent many years walking a very fine line between you and your mother and on this occasion, he stumbled. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be uninvited from the wedding. You should give him a second chance, but make it clear that your mother is not welcome.\nYour mother is an asshole. She may be a reformed asshole and she may not. You could try meeting with her on neutral territory to see if she has changed. She should be willing to apologise to you, your wife and your wife\u2019s family. Then it would be up to your wife whether she wants to meet with your mother and up to both of you whether your mother gets to meet your daughter. Then all of you would have to agree on inviting her to the wedding. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough time before the wedding to judge if your mother has truly changed or even if you\u2019re willing to give her a second chance. But I do think that your dad deserves one.", "ESh. I get that your dad shouldn't have done it, but to cut him out of the wedding. Also, at least for me it sounds like you are making decisions without asking your daughter and soon to be son-in-law. That's not okay whatsoever. Your daughter and father seem to have a close relationship and you are right now making decisions for her, just like your mum tried to do for you...", "YTA. The wedding invites are the prerogative of the bride and the groom. This is their decision to make, independent of whatever mayhem and harm your parents created during your own wedding.\n\nIf the bride and the groom decide to invite her grandparents, it should be with the clear understanding that all the adults -- yourself included -- put aside their grievances for that one day and join in wishing the bride and the groom the best as they embark on their journey as a married couple.", "YTA, but barely. I understand the hurt and betrayal your mother inflicted on you, but uninviting your dad is not your decision to make. Your daughter should have final say on any invites including whether her grandmother can attend or not. \n\nAlso do not blame your dad for advocating for your mom. If you parents are still married then this has probably been hard for him to balance. Familial conflicts are not a zero sum game, where one side wins and one loses. He is not so much \"taking her side\" as trying to work towards a solution for everyone. Your father is in the difficult position of wanting to mend his family. He's stayed in your good graces for this long and earned the love of your family, so it might be worth trusting his judgement enough to give your mom a shot.\n\nYou have no obligation to reconnect to your mother or forgive her, but almost 30 years with no contact is a very long time. If your mother was essentially falling on her own sword trying to reconnect with you then I'd say it was at least worth finding a time to speak to her and hear her out. Also I'd say that proclaiming she's a changed woman shows she does in fact have remorse for her previous actions. I could be wrong, but you'll never know unless you actually speak to her. If she can't fully apologize or shows she really hasn't changed then you are fully entitled to keeping her cut off. Then if your father still insists after a botched conversation you could have hard reasons for why you don't want to see her.", "OP: Here's what you do.   \nStep one, have her write a written apology letter to EVERYONE in your wife's family that she insulted or made uncomfortable.   \nStep two: Have her write a promise letter that she will hold her tunge, and to not speak unless spoken two during the wedding and the rehearsal and the reception.   \nStep three: Understand that this is NOT your wedding, it's your lovely daughters, she gets to decide if grampa is coming or not.   \nStep four: Only ever engage in discussion with you mom with witnesses around, so that she cannot turn it against you.  \n\n\nVerdict: ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think hes well within his rights as a parent to try and protect his kid from that kind of evil. \n\nIf his daughter pushes for her to come, I think he should sit her down and explain his reasoning for why he doesn't think she shouldnt come and ultimatelyleave it up to her. Honestly I wish my Dad would have placed boundaries like what OP is doing. As someone who lived thru the exact thing OP is trying to avoid I adamantly think hes making the right call when it comes to his Mom. \n\nI think that inviting or not inviting his Dad should be up to his kid. But boundaries should be put in place to protect her on her special day. Like having security or whatnot to ensure his Mom doesn't try to randomly show up uninvited. \n\nIf she wants a relationship, great. Start small like coffee or whatnot. Dont go from no contact to having what is ultimately a stranger come to your wedding."]}
