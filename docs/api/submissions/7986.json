I invited him to my daughter\u2019s wedding, but not my mom, for obvious reasons.\n\nUnfortunately, my dad isn\u2019t great at keeping secrets, and the very next day my mom showed up, unsolicited, at my front door.

I would also step up and pay for a security guard at the wedding and reception if you can afford it.  I\u2019m so glad your dad has had a relationship with your daughter.

A major public life event is not the right venue for reconnecting after a serious harm followed by thirty years of no contact.

Have you had a conversation with your dad about his role in your mom showing up, and how that affected your trust in him?", "NTA, not even close. Your Mom is the asshole in the situation, not you. You may want to consider setting up a time for your Mom to meet your kiddo to work on building that relationship if your daughter wants to pursue it. I definitely could see how this situation is difficult for your Dad. I'm sure he didn't do anything intentionally to hurt you, its probably coming from a good place in his heart. \n\nWith that said, I fully support your decision to not let your Mom come to your kids wedding. That's a natural, logical consequence to the hell she rained down on your wedding. \n\nAllow her a 2nd chance to have a relationship with your kid? Sure. Invite her to dinner, to a birthday party, out hiking. But dont invite her to the wedding.", "NTA. If she had changed.

She has shown a pattern of inappropriate behavior and has never apologized for her actions at your own wedding. You have also had a strained relationship with her for many years.\n\nHowever, it is understandable that your wife and daughter may be disappointed if your father is not able to attend the wedding. It is important to consider their feelings and the impact it may have on them.\n\nIt may be worth having a conversation with your father about your concerns and setting clear boundaries for your mother's involvement in the wedding. It could also be beneficial for you and your wife to have a conversation with your daughter about the situation and explain why you made the decision you did.\n\nIn this situation, it may be difficult to please everyone, but it is important to prioritize the safety and comfort of yourself, your wife, and your daughter on your daughter's special day.

You should give him a second chance, but make it clear that your mother is not welcome.\nYour mother is an asshole. She may be a reformed asshole and she may not. You could try meeting with her on neutral territory to see if she has changed. She should be willing to apologise to you, your wife and your wife\u2019s family. Then it would be up to your wife whether she wants to meet with your mother and up to both of you whether your mother gets to meet your daughter.

Also, at least for me it sounds like you are making decisions without asking your daughter and soon to be son-in-law. That's not okay whatsoever.

The wedding invites are the prerogative of the bride and the groom. This is their decision to make, independent of whatever mayhem and harm your parents created during your own wedding.\n\nIf the bride and the groom decide to invite her grandparents, it should be with the clear understanding that all the adults -- yourself included -- put aside their grievances for that one day and join in wishing the bride and the groom the best as they embark on their journey as a married couple.", "YTA, but barely. I understand the hurt and betrayal your mother inflicted on you, but uninviting your dad is not your decision to make. Your daughter should have final say on any invites including whether her grandmother can attend or not. \n\nAlso do not blame your dad for advocating for your mom. If you parents are still married then this has probably been hard for him to balance. Familial conflicts are not a zero sum game, where one side wins and one loses. He is not so much \"taking her side\" as trying to work towards a solution for everyone. Your father is in the difficult position of wanting to mend his family. He's stayed in your good graces for this long and earned the love of your family, so it might be worth trusting his judgement enough to give your mom a shot.\n\nYou have no obligation to reconnect to your mother or forgive her, but almost 30 years with no contact is a very long time. If your mother was essentially falling on her own sword trying to reconnect with you then I'd say it was at least worth finding a time to speak to her and hear her out. Also I'd say that proclaiming she's a changed woman shows she does in fact have remorse for her previous actions. I could be wrong, but you'll never know unless you actually speak to her. If she can't fully apologize or shows she really hasn't changed then you are fully entitled to keeping her cut off. Then if your father still insists after a botched conversation you could have hard reasons for why you don't want to see her.", "OP: Here's what you do.   \nStep one, have her write a written apology letter to EVERYONE in your wife's family that she insulted or made uncomfortable.   \nStep two: Have her write a promise letter that she will hold her tunge, and to not speak unless spoken two during the wedding and the rehearsal and the reception.   \nStep three: Understand that this is NOT your wedding, it's your lovely daughters, she gets to decide if grampa is coming or not.   \nStep four: Only ever engage in discussion with you mom with witnesses around, so that she cannot turn it against you.  \n\n\nVerdict: ESH", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He now let her know where you live and is going against everyone's desire to not have her at your daughter's wedding.

So, although you may have overstepped your role here, you did it after a pretty big betrayal, and your frustration and anger at your father isn completely justified. \n\nA wedding is not a therapy session or a test run to see if someone has changed. Your mother had years to apologize and make amends, but she never did.

He can't believe that your mom's racism and racist actions were THAT bad, b/c if he did, he never would have done this. There were much better ways to approach this if he felt his wife had true remorse. He chose the path where he could both appease his wife (give her your address) but appear to not get dirty (he didn't bring up the subject and there was a chance you wouldn't assume he gave her your location or that he knew about her actions) - which is why I think he has been playing both sides since day one.\n\nDiscuss w/ your daughter what she wants to do about your father's invite.

Talk to the bride and offer advice or ask the favor, but don't just unilaterally make the decision for them.", "If it was me and my daughter decided to invite someone who was that awful, I might reconsider attending.", "YTA....for taking away your Father's invite. Based on what you have said his weakness maybe standing up to your Mom.\n\nThere are many ways your Mom could have researched and found your address on her own. Your Father can't control anyone. No one can control another person at the end of the day we are all accountable for our own actions. \n\nI can understand your being upset with your Mom but your Dad has been there for you. Don't ruin that over one mistake that he did not have control over.\n\nIf your daughter wants your Dad there then that is really what matters.\n\nI hope that perhaps someday you can sit down and talk with your Mom and work this out. People are not perfect, people can change, people situations are grey not black and white. Holding on to these negative emotions are draining. Good Luck!", "Exactly. If \"Mom\" wants to reconcile, then she has to do it at OPs pace. NOT at OPs daughter's wedding. Absolutely not, especially since that's what she's demanding. \n\nIt's on mom to prove she's changed, and she's had years to do this, and has not. She wants to be seen at the wedding, because it's a big, public event, and she wants the prestige.  Nope, she does not get to start there.", "Being a racist isn't \"one mistake\". If OPs father can't stand up to his racist wife then he has no right to be upset at being excluded from family events.  And yeah he told his wife, it was no coincidence she found out immediately after her husband was told. Ultimately it's up to the bride and groom but OPs actions are perfectly justified.", "Im not convinced he told his wife, but I dont think thats overly relevant\n\n>My dad called me afterwards and said that I was too harsh and that I should give her a second chance. He said this could be a good opportunity for my wife and I to \u201creconnect\u201d with my mom\n\nThe point for me is that he took her side. \"Its ok now - she is slightly less racist!\"\n\nThats not a very good argument lol\n\nSo I agree. Perfectly justified.", "NTA regarding your mother. She can't expect to become part of your life again without some kind of ownership to why she was excluded from it for almost 30 years. She needs to verbalize what she has learned and why history won't repeat itself.\n\nIt's a tougher call regarding your father. It's understandable that he would want to reunite the family, but he's gone about it in a totally unacceptable way. It would be harsh to exclude him from his granddaughter's wedding, but it would not be acceptable for him to unilaterally bring your mother without approval on your end. I would say N A H if I could give a split verdict.\n\nUltimately, it should be your daughter's decision as she is old enough to understand the situation.", "It's not your wedding. As such, the only person who's attendance you have any right to influence is you. Your daughter and her husband invite the people they want to be there, not you. If you think that any individual who will be attending will make you uncomfortable then you have the option to not attend. NAH", "YTA. Since when are parents in control of wedding invitations. This should be your daughters choice not yours", "YTA Its not your wedding. You have no rights whatsoever to just uninvite people.", "NTA. Can't believe you allowed them to come to your wedding...", "Racism is disgusting. Nta. Please continue to protect your daughter", "NOPE, absolutely NTA. You are doing right by your family by not allowing your mother to be around them. Your dad is sadly enabling her crappy behavior. She's a racist and a bigot and there are consequences to being that way. She's going to have to suck it up and decide that if she has that kind of hatred inside of her, she's going to have to deal with being treated a certain way for it. Too bad.\n\nCongrats to your daughter on the upcoming wedding! I wouldn't want to take any chances by it being spoiled either.\n\nETA: Is it possible to discuss the reason why you don't want Grandpa at the wedding to your daughter? Does she know the possibility that he may bring your mom along? I totally get why you wouldn't want either of them there, but I'd have a conversation with her and let her make up her mind if it's worth the risk or not. Still NTA though. You sound like a loving dad.", "NTA\n\nThis said you could offer to pick your dad up and take him.\n\nIf your mum wants to mend bridges she can try to do that outside of the big day.", "NTA", "NTA but what's your daughter's opinion about your mother coming or not coming? It's her and her fianc\u00e9's wedding, and I think they should have final say (assuming they know the long history here) about if your parents are invited or not (or to only invite your dad)", "NTA.  A wedding isn't the place to reconnect with an estranged family member.  I'd re-invite your dad and tell him that if he brings your mother, *she* will be asked to leave by the security you've hired.  Tell him that if she wants to reconnect with you and your family that she needs to start *now* and not wait for the wedding.  The first thing she needs to do is apologize to your wife and it must be genuine:\n\n\"Dad, mom must admit that she was racist towards my wife and her family and that she ruined our wedding with her behavior.  She should then apologize to my wife and promise to never make those types of comments again even if she's \"just joking\".  If she fails to own up to her behavior, then we won't accept her apology.  After that she must understand that she is on a *very short leash* and the next racist/rude incident she causes will cause her to be cut off.  If she does all of this and manages to prove to us that she has truly changed then we may allow her to come to the wedding but that will be up to her granddaughter that she has never acknowledged until now.\"", "Info: why isn\u2019t this up to your daughter? Also, I assume your mom and dad are still married reading your post? Your dad has remained a very active part of your life but you haven\u2019t spoken to or seen your mom in 30 years? This post is suspect to me.", "\"I'm sorry for acting very abruptly in my decision. I've decided that since - daughters name- is asking for you, I would like to reinstate your invitation; HOWEVER i need to make it perfectly clear. The invitation is for you and you alone. No date, no plus one, and no spouse. If you chose to bring mom anyways she will be escorted out immediately. I'm asking you to consider your granddaughter in your decision as to whether or not you come. The choice is yours but mom is not part of the package. It's not up for discussion.", "And the fianc\u00e9\u2019s too, of course, because he\u2019s probably also going to end up facing some microaggressions at the very least. NTA, because grandpa\u2019s continuing marriage to the mom means he clearly doesn\u2019t think racism is a big deal and I wouldn\u2019t want someone like that around either, but this isn\u2019t OP\u2019s wheelhouse."]}
