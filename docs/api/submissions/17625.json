I am their bio and Shelly was adopted from foster care when we were 4. Shelly has physical and intellectual disabilities. My parents always wanted to foster and adopt and I was a whoops baby which is something they have been more honest about since I was a teenager. My parents fostered Shelly for about three months before saying they would try to make it a permanent home for her and they have said they knew after three months she was the child they were meant to be the parents of.\n\nMy parents could not manage Shelly's and my needs together. She took up a lot of their focus. Most of the family resources were spent on her therapies, medical expenses and making her life as fulfilling as possible. She also got the best of our parents. They were so calm and loving toward her and were always willing to do whatever she needed. With me they put stuff off far more, they never had the emotional energy left to be there when I needed them. Often times they would tell me I was old enough to handle things myself. So when I was bullied in school at 6, they told me I was old enough to speak to my teacher about it and advocate for myself \"you're a big girl now and big girls speak up when someone says or does mean stuff\". When a teacher made a mistake with my grade and didn't listen to me they told me to go to the principal myself. I was 11 that time. When I was home sick from school I didn't get as coddled as most of my friends did when they were sick. I had to get up and get my own drinks, still had to eat at the table and if I needed to be brought to the doctor it would always be left a bit longer than it should be and my mom and dad both got scolded for that before by doctors. I got my tonsils out as a kid and my parents rescheduled my appointment a dozen times to fit it around Shelly's therapies or doctors visits. \n\nThey had me ask my grandparents for the money for a laptop for school because they apparently could not justify the cost.\n\nNow my parents want to go to an out of state wedding and they told me I would need to watch Shelly for 4 days because they've burned out. I told them I could not do that. Their response was they have done it all this time and I am perfectly capable of taking over for a short period. I told them it was too much. They called it BS. I told them it was too much and it was too much for them to handle too, that they took on too much when they adopted Shelly from foster care when they already had me, My parents lost their shit, Mom told me I was entitled, selfish and possessive and should be over the fact I am not their only child right now. Dad said I was 17, not 7, that I was too old to have that kind of attitude about the family. He then told me not to forget that Shelly was the child they always intended to have.\n\nThey are still mad at me for saying what I did.

The thing is I really do believe that and I feel as though they struggled because of her complex needs. But Shelly is my sister and they have adopted her and she's been family for most of our lives. When I said it I wasn't trying to be hurtful or rude but saying something like that is kind of like saying you don't want someone around. None of this is Shelly's fault and maybe it's not really my parents fault. I feel like I could be a huge asshole for making it sound wrong that my parents brought my sister into the family and into all our lives and I don't want to be an asshole. This feels like something that might be a line too far though.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

One of them will have to stay behind.", "Your experience sounds somewhat similar to What siblings of childhood cancer survivers recount. Your parents Are so focused on your Sisters speciale needs that they do not see your regular needs. You are treated as part of the parent team in the care of your sister, and told to adult up when frustrated.\n\nIn the perfect world this would not be the case.

Not in an angry way, in a calm way. And then answering any further questions they have.\n\nBoth myself and also a best friend of mine come from families where we constantly had to bottle things up and cope without parental support because our parents were burnt out dealing with difficult siblings. So I know how you feel and I can only say nothing will improve unless they know.\n\nTell them that just because your sister needs MORE support, doesn't mean you don't need support too. You were a child, and at 17 you still are, and tell them that you FEEL you and your needs were often neglected and as a result of that they have made you into a person who isn't capable or has any desire to help them in return. Tell them that this is all fixable but after 17 years it's time they remembered they have two kids and just because one has special needs doesn't mean the other doesn't need help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
