My parents always wanted to foster and adopt and I was a whoops baby which is something they have been more honest about since I was a teenager.

She took up a lot of their focus. Most of the family resources were spent on her therapies, medical expenses and making her life as fulfilling as possible. She also got the best of our parents. They were so calm and loving toward her and were always willing to do whatever she needed. With me they put stuff off far more, they never had the emotional energy left to be there when I needed them. Often times they would tell me I was old enough to handle things myself. So when I was bullied in school at 6, they told me I was old enough to speak to my teacher about it and advocate for myself \"you're a big girl now and big girls speak up when someone says or does mean stuff\". When a teacher made a mistake with my grade and didn't listen to me they told me to go to the principal myself. I was 11 that time.

I told them it was too much and it was too much for them to handle too, that they took on too much when they adopted Shelly from foster care when they already had me, My parents lost their shit, Mom told me I was entitled, selfish and possessive and should be over the fact I am not their only child right now. Dad said I was 17, not 7, that I was too old to have that kind of attitude about the family.

The thing is I really do believe that and I feel as though they struggled because of her complex needs. But Shelly is my sister and they have adopted her and she's been family for most of our lives. When I said it I wasn't trying to be hurtful or rude but saying something like that is kind of like saying you don't want someone around. None of this is Shelly's fault and maybe it's not really my parents fault. I feel like I could be a huge asshole for making it sound wrong that my parents brought my sister into the family and into all our lives and I don't want to be an asshole.
