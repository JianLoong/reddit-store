My daughter picks MIL up after her class is over, they go shopping, then they go out to eat. MIL always pays. \n\nI'm not stoked about my daughter spending this much time with MIL because MIL clearly favors middle. She always denies having a favorite but she does subtle things like always saying yes if middle wants to go out, even if she just said no to another grandkid but she'll try to make it seem like middle asked first. Middle was also wearing these \"fake\" diamond earrings that she said she bought at a craft fair but they look very similar to my MIL's diamond earrings. Since she's getting older, she's been inviting all of her grandkids over to take her jewelry but middle walks around with jewelry that wasn't up for grabs for the other kids. \n\nAnyways, on Tuesday middle and MIL went to a deli that's famous for their sandwiches. They each got a sandwich but they're huge so middle only ate half and MIL ate a third. MIL doesn't eat leftovers so she told middle to take the sandwiches home and let someone else eat hers. \n\nI got home and middle showed me MIL's sandwich and told me I can take it for lunch, so yesterday I took a sandwich and left for work. Middle called me during my lunch and told me that I took her sandwich. She asked me to come home and get the one I was supposed to take but that would take half my lunch break so I said no. She started to get upset and said that she really wanted to eat that sandwich for lunch but I told her I wouldn't be able to go home and switch the sandwiches. Then Middle said either I have to return her sandwich or go to the deli and buy her a new one. I'm not driving 30 minutes to spend $20 on a sandwich. \n\nMiddle started crying because she \"really wanted that sandwich\" and hung up on me. I guess her next move was to call MIL and tell her what happened because when I came home, there was a new sandwich in the fridge with middle's name on it and I got an angry text from FIL's phone. \n\nMy husband agrees with middle and MIL that I should've returned or replaced the sandwich. Everyone seems to be against me so I wanted an outside opinion.

They appear to be two separate issues that you're talking about as one, here.", "INFO - Were the leftovers labeled?", "YTA. All this stuff about middle being MiL\u2019s favorite is irrelevant to the situation at hand but it\u2019s interesting that you included it, because basically it seems like you felt the need to take middle down a peg and so you are treating her worse in order to balance out this perceived favoritism. Why on earth do parents feel the need to do that to their own kids? What is that? Is it jealousy? What? Are you absolutely sure that you don\u2019t always treat middle a little worse than the rest of your kids and MIL isn\u2019t doing a little rebalancing of her own? \n\nBecause this clearly isn\u2019t about the sandwich. Someone with a healthy normal relationship with their children would have just said oh man, sorry I took the wrong sandwich, I can\u2019t fix my mistake right this second but I\u2019ll get you another sandwich next time it\u2019s convenient. And then that kid would be like \u201ccool thanks\u201d. You wouldn\u2019t have posted all this other garbage about how you clearly resent your own child as well as your MiL", "Reading your comments I say YTA.\n\nYou say, none of the other kids feels any negative favoritism or complains about your MIL in any way.\n\nYou say, she showed you which sandwich to take\n\nYou refused to bring new one with the pare thin excuse that then you'd have to bring everyone else one too, when there's nothing indicating that they even want one and you even wrote they don't like those sandwiches.\n\n\nSo what's left?\n\nYour daughter brought home two sandwiches and told you you could have one, showed you which one to take and how much she wanted hers.\n\nBut still you took hers, were unwilling to give it back or get another one and while you said you're sorry, you do nothing to back that up by making it right.\n\nThis doesn't sound like an honest mistake anymore. This sounds as if you're going out of your way to make your daughter miserable.\n\nWhy do you dislike her so much? Are you the one who feels left out and envies the attention your MIL gives your daughter? At your own admittance, it's not your other children who feel left out. So it sounds more like you don't really like that your daughter is treated nicely and your other children are just an excuse.", "YTA. **It was never about the sandwich.**\n\nI suspect your daughter's upset was fueled by your \"Too bad\" attitude.\n\nI doubt she would have cried if you just apologized for your mistake... if it was a mistake.\n\nObviously, something happened to escalate the situation to where tears and bad feelings were involved; we really only have your side of the story, minimizing any negative interaction on your part and spending most of your post justifying eating your daughter's sandwich with detailed complaints about \"favoritism.\"", "YTA.\n\nBecause what does the so-called favoritism have to do with the story as a whole?\n\nYour daughter offered you a sandwich and you took the wrong one.  Point blank period.  She WANTED to eat her sandwich and you made the mistake.  You should have just grabbed some takeout and brought her sandwich back home at the end of the day if you didn't have time to bring it home on your lunch.  Or you could have brought it home on your lunch and eaten on your way back to work (the CORRECT sandwich).\n\nIt sounds more like you're angry over the favoritism and wanted to punish your daughter for reaping the benefits of it than considering what was fair or right in this particular situation.  The favoritism issue is a whole different story.  You should have nipped that in the bud WAY before your daughter turned 18.", "YTA. You add all that extra favoritism stuff in to justify yourself in punishing your kid for her relationship with her grandmother. You took the wrong sandwich, you could have eaten a different lunch and brought it home after work. But you want to take something from your kid because other grandchildren aren't given the same treatment, which is petty and problematic.", "I wouldnt think anything of this if you hadnt put in all that favoritsm bs. Because niw it looks like you intentionally toon the sandwich. That or subconsciously, you did it, wanting to take the middle down a peg. Which is weird asf if I'm honest.\n\nAlso, side note, the solution to the 'favoritism' isn't being mad that they spend time tigetherb uts encouraging the MIL to include your other kids.", "INFO: What kind of sandwich?\n\nGenuinely curious since she was so hellbent on getting it back. It must be delicious.", "Talk to your MIL if you have a problem. Middle isn't causing the favoritism. Deal with the adult in the situation.\n\nYTA you took her sandwich and it sounds like you didn't care about you think she deserves some sort of \"negative\" to counter act all of the extra attention she gets.", "YTA\n\nHonestly I find it hard to believe it was accidental to grab the wrong one since there is usually a visible difference between a half sandwich and two thirds of a sandwich. The size difference alone should have been enough to ensure you grabbed the correct one when packing your lunch.", "YTA. It sounds like you resent your daughter and MIL's relationship.", "YTA\n\nOP, do you realize that you sound extremely **jealous** of your own daughter? You claim favoritism yet the only evidence you have is MIL saying no to one grandchild and yes to the other. Even the earrings example is worthless, because for all you know, your Middle daughter simply likes the style of her MIL's earrings and decided that she wanted them as well.\n\nInstead, you chose not to believe your own daughter. You don't want your middle daughter to spend time with MIL, which believe me, she gets that message loud and clear. I can guarantee you that your facial expressions and body language speaks for itself. And it's only going to build more and more resentment between you, MIL and your own daughter.\n\nYou could've easily distinguished between sandwiches, if one was half eaten while the other was 2/3' intact. You ate your daughters sandwich yet refuse to repay her or return it when she called, knowing that there was actually a bigger sandwich waiting for you.\n\nYou made a mistake, yet didn't show a hint of remorse or wishing to pay it back. Instead, you acted entitled and told her to suck it up, you weren't going to pay up for a sandwich (that you never paid for) nor would you order take out and bring the sandwich back to your daughter.\n\n**This isn't about the sandwich. This is about your envy, bitterness and jealousy towards Middle Daughter and MIL.**\n\nYou are simply angry over the *favoritism* and instead of talking with MIL like an adult, you're taking it out on your daughter like a bratty child.  The supposed favoritism should've been nipped in the bud before your daughter became 18.\n\nBut if you continuously approach your daughter with envy, resentment and barely vailed jealousy, of course she's going to run towards MIL. There she has someone who understands her, who shows her compassion. \n\nBecause I can only assume that out of retaliation against MIL, you force middle to share everything she gets, or you shower your other kids with gifts to make it \"fair\".", "YTA. \n\nThis is an interesting post. Middle children are typically the most neglected. Especially if there are exactly 3 kids. There is a plethora of research behind this. It is hard for parents to avoid, I have seen in across families of various cultures. The oldest is favoured, the youngest is doted in, the middle is just, well, there. Maybe your MIL senses this and is attempting to bridge the gap? I don't see any malicious intent from her. \n\nYou state yourself that the other kids also think they are MIL's favourite, so, what's the issue? What do you have against your middle daughter? \n\nThe way you talk about their relationship is a little weird. I 100% doubt you didn't know which sandwich was hers. You almost come across as jealous of her relationship with MIL.", "YTA.  Your preamble about MIL makes me question whether you took the wrong sandwich (even subconsciously) out of spite.  The sandwiches were not the same size, you knew the smaller one was yours, and you took the bigger one when leaving for work.  OK, let's say it was a mistake.  You ate middle's sandwich.  Yes, she's being unreasonable and childish to ask you to leave work for it, but you're also being an AH for not trying to make up for your mistake in any way.  If you don't want to drive to pick up a new sandwich, offer to buy her dinner or something.  You're the adult here, for crying out loud.", "YTA. End of", "Yta", "YTA.

You can't tell the difference between a 1/2 sandwich and a 2/3 sandwich? It wasn't an accident and you should have replaced the sandwich.", "YTA- honestly in your own narrative you provide more evidence that you are focused against middle than MIL is biased towards her. Middle can't help it if, for whatever reason, her bond with MIL runs a little deeper than some others.", "YTA and like 1/2 your post was irrelevant.", "YTA, for eating it. I understand taking it by mistake, but once you knew what you did the move was to bring it back home with you.", "The context around  MIL is irrelevant to this question  and is a separate issue. \n\nAre you sure you grabbed the wrong sandwich by accident?  Look, she had a sandwich,  and it should be clear which was which.  If it was truly an accident,  then she probably  blew it out of proportion,  but offering to pick her something up on the way home from work would be reasonable since you made the mistake...not necessarily from the same place, [r offering to take her there another day.\n\nSo soft ESHA for her blowing it out of proportion and you  for not trying to work it out equitably.\n\nThat said, I suspect you took that specific sandwich on purpose,which would  make YTA", "YTA You can't just steal people's shit and not expect consequences.

You can't even be bothered to come up with a fake *name* for her.  \n\nShe showed you which sandwich she was giving you.  You took the other one - and I'm not convinced this wasn't intentional.  You couldn't even manage the barest words even vaguely resembling an apology.\n\nSee, you present this as your MIL favoring your middle child.  But even through your own telling of this, it comes across as MIL realizing that your daughter is *your* unfavorite and trying to somehow make up for that.", "I\u2019m glad middle has a positive female role model in MIL since she obviously doesn\u2019t have one at home.\nObviously YTA, she acts the way she does because you act the way you do.

Also why does it matter if MIL seems to favor middle child? Jealous much?   \nI think I see exactly why your MIL is so close to your daughter. I have a feeling this is not the first time you intentionally, oops, accidently, did something to upset your daughter and tried to throw it back on her. My mom pulled similar stunts on me: she favored my older sister but would deny it but it was very obvious to her friends and our family. Example, when she had graduations she got gifts and parties. I got a card and nothing else and if I didn't seem grateful enough she called me selfish. My older sister was allowed to beat me up and my mom would blame me. When grandma got wind of it she told my mom to stop blaming me and control my sister or she would make sure I got to live with her either her or my dad instea d of my mom. So you are all upset that boo hoo mother in law is kind to your daughter???? That omg someone makes her feel special and not like a burden like you do? Why aren't you just grateful that your MIL replaced it? Geez lady! Grow up!", "YTA if you ate her sandwich.  You found out it was a mistake.  I wouldnt drive home either.  However I would have then picked up something else.  That is very rude and I hate when others take my food.  You knew one was hers.

If you had, it would be treated as an honest mistake and probably not something anyone would even post about here. I get not leaving work to switch the sandwiches, but picking one up later would have been merely right.\n\nThe rest of this post comes across as you looking for ways to excuse your behaviour by...what? Suggesting that your daughter somehow doesn\u2019t deserve a sandwich because she and her grandma are close? So nobody should be annoyed with you for taking it? Your MIL wanted to treat kiddo, you took what she had given to kid. She replaced it but is reasonably irritated with you.", "YTA and sound jealous and petty. You really grabbed the wrong sandwich?

My daughter picks MIL up after her class is over, they go shopping, then they go out to eat. MIL always pays. \n\nI'm not stoked about my daughter spending this much time with MIL because MIL clearly favors middle. She always denies having a favorite but she does subtle things like always saying yes if middle wants to go out, even if she just said no to another grandkid but she'll try to make it seem like middle asked first. Middle was also wearing these \"fake\" diamond earrings that she said she bought at a craft fair but they look very similar to my MIL's diamond earrings. Since she's getting older, she's been inviting all of her grandkids over to take her jewelry but middle walks around with jewelry that wasn't up for grabs for the other kids. \n\nAnyways, on Tuesday middle and MIL went to a deli that's famous for their sandwiches. They each got a sandwich but they're huge so middle only ate half and MIL ate a third. MIL doesn't eat leftovers so she told middle to take the sandwiches home and let someone else eat hers. \n\nI got home and middle showed me MIL's sandwich and told me I can take it for lunch, so yesterday I took a sandwich and left for work. Middle called me during my lunch and told me that I took her sandwich. She asked me to come home and get the one I was supposed to take but that would take half my lunch break so I said no. She started to get upset and said that she really wanted to eat that sandwich for lunch but I told her I wouldn't be able to go home and switch the sandwiches. Then Middle said either I have to return her sandwich or go to the deli and buy her a new one. I'm not driving 30 minutes to spend $20 on a sandwich. \n\nMiddle started crying because she \"really wanted that sandwich\" and hung up on me. I guess her next move was to call MIL and tell her what happened because when I came home, there was a new sandwich in the fridge with middle's name on it and I got an angry text from FIL's phone. \n\nMy husband agrees with middle and MIL that I should've returned or replaced the sandwich. Everyone seems to be against me so I wanted an outside opinion. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And if you believe your other kids will be upset buy them one too or explain how you fucked up and replacing the sandwich was how to fix the issue.\n\nThis issue is so stupid as well! Instead of fixing a simple problem you whine to strangers on the internet hoping they validit your reaction to upsetting you daughter.

If you're mad about your mother-in-law favoring one of your kids, do the adult thing and have a fight with her.", "YTA.\n\nPeople are against you because you are wrong in this situation, and frankly, too petty for words.\n\nKeep your dislike of your MIL between you two and stop involving your child - that's not what a good parent does.", "YTA you took food that wasn't yours, standard protocol is to apologize and replace. It doesn't make it ok just because it was your kids.", "YTA for allowing middle to be heavily favored in this manner and getting spoilt. Why don\u2019t you draw boundaries with your in-laws  ?", "What in the heck did I just read? Really?", "I don\u2019t know who this AH is.  I do see a very dysfunctional family.  FIL angry texting.  MIL will the strange dynamic.  Daughter who sounds really immature.  A husband who knows.  A sandwich thief?   It is really strange and their is a lot going on here.  I think some family therapy and some boundaries are needed.", "ESH. You for jealousy against your daughter and obvious dislike of your MIL for what appears to be a love for your daughter, and the entitlement of your daughter over demanding you leave work to return a sandwich. Maybe your daughter has such a relationship with her grandmother because she actually spends time with her! I did with mine, we went to the movies and out to eat and the beach when even after my brother and cousins stopped because I had fun with her. That being said, demanding you return her sandwich is and then calling grandma is ridiculous. You should say sorry it was an accident.", "YTA in a way. But honestly 18 is too old to be crying over a sandwich.  I have to ask through, do you even like your child? Because it\u2019s a little odd and telling that you can\u2019t even refer to someone that you gave birth to by they\u2019re own name or hell at least an initial. Only calling your own  child Middle like they\u2019re an accessory in closet sounds like you don\u2019t have much of a relationship. You obviously can\u2019t stand your MIL, and you seem to take it very personal that your daughter is close to her. But have you ever wondered why she\u2019s closer to your daughter then you are? Maybe she does favor her more, but I\u2019m positive YOU are the reason why.", "NTA if you didn't know which one you were offered. Otherwise YTA, Middle is 18, she can decide who she spends time with and how much. Jewelry is her grandma's to decide who it goes to. If she gives middle a $5000.00 ring and oldest a $30 necklace and youngest a bracelet from a gumball machine it's NOT YOUR BUSINESS.", "NTA if it was a mistake bcs that\u2019s overly dramatic over half a sandwich. YTA if she did it on purpose bcs she preferred daughters sandwich and decided to just grab it.  A bit unclear", "I'm really confused.  What purpose did that chapter talking about her being the favorite serve?", "ESH\n\nYou do sound resentful of middle and MIL\u2019s relationship. But your middle sound like spoiled brat too", "I actually don't think it was a mistake.  OP purposely took middle's sammich", "Reading at OP's comments... I'm honestly starting to believe that the one writing is the oldest. There is absolutely zero mention of the youngest anywhere.\n\nOf course there is also the option that the whole post can basically be summed \"I can't believe my MIL treats my middle daughter better than my oldest, who is perfect in every way possible, the light of my eyes, the future heir of all my wordly possesions...\"\n\nLike...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>*It's a fucking sandwich.She doesn't need someone to listen and care about her feelings. She could make another sandwich at home.*\n\nYou can't get more blatant than this. Who talks about their child with such vitriol, hate and resentment?", "I kept reading waiting for her to connect the favoritism to the sandwich but the situations were entirely disconnected. it shows that it wasn't a simple misunderstanding.", "This is exactly what I was thinking. Op, the heck is your deal with this kid? Heck, I get the feeling we don't have the full story here and only have the minor details.", "Had the same thoughts. Why include all that? My dad used to \u201ctake me down a peg\u201d because he thought my mom favored me. It sucks.", "I am wondering if Middle might be stepmiddle.", "What? Would you spend most of your lunch break not eating, but driving to bring a sandwich home? \n\nI mean...accidents happen.", "> I 100% doubt you didn't know which sandwich was hers.\n\nThis post almost reads like a parody of someone thinking they're clever.\n\n> I got home and middle **showed me MIL's sandwich** and told me I can take it for lunch, so yesterday I **took *a* sandwich** and left for work.\n\nLike, there's 52 million active users on reddit every day, did he think we'd all just miss that?\n\nEDIT And right after I posted this I see that [*the sandwiches were fucking labeled*](https://old.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrlpv0/aita_for_eating_my_daughters_sandwich/ivu8m8l/).", "Perhaps the MIL favors the middle child because mom treats her like dirt.", "I wonder if it was like a \u201cforgotten middle child\u201d situation with the parents, so MIL decided she\u2019d treat the middle child better to make up for it. Just my speculative opinion tho", "Except that the daughter said she could have the sandwich for lunch, and unless it was marked up it\u2019s an easy mistake to make. I\u2019ve accidentally taken a whole lunchbox filled with mashed potatoes to work instead of the lunch I had planned. It happens", "honestly it feels like taking the wrong sandwich was probably a shot across the bow at her MIL.", "Maybe the 18 yr old got worked up because OP frequently pulls this passive-aggressive stuff on her. There is definitely more going on than OP is telling.", "The reaction might be caused because this is a repeated pattern in OP. \n\nI have several times left food intended to be eaten the next day or when I\u2019m back from school/work/whatever... Only to found out it was eaten. One time I exploded because I was using my food scholarship during the pandemic to buy groceries for my home and treating myself buying a box of cereal or a box with \u201cfancy\u201d coffee... and my ND was serving himself the damn coffee \ud83d\ude43\n\nSo yeah, there\u2019s more to this than what OP is letting slide.", "I have a feeling, with the way she constantly refers to her daughter as middle, and her reaction to things, that she isn\u2019t the nicest and pulls the stereotypical middle child gets ignored bullshit", "Same. As a mother, there's no way on earth I would take half my lunch break to return a sandwich because I took the wrong half or whatever.  That's insane. Eat the other sandwich and don't be a whiner.  Sounds like Middle is a spoiled and entitled little shite imo.  NTA", "I'd wager that her reaction had more to do with her mom's disdain for her rather than a sandwich.", "Probably labeled because this is not the first time OP pulled this stunt.", "If MIL is favoring one child over the others, that's on her. She's the one that won't have great relationships with the other two, not you. My ex MIL had always favored my son over my girls, everyone knows it. My girls love their grandmother and she does try to give them things or take them places, even be there when they need to talk sometimes. As much as I wish she treated them all the same, it's not my relationship to step into. \n\nIs your MIL rude or neglectful to the other two? If not, just step back. Maybe MIL can relate better to middle.", "Ok, well I\u2019m a middle girl to three girls. The only time I got one on one with my mother? When I became a mother myself. Middle children are usually more independent and maybe she craves that one on one with someone. I mean yes I think she is totally overreacting to a sandwich. I think that ridiculous, but think about why your daughter wants to spend so much time with her grandmother. Still to this day, it\u2019s ALWAYS about my older sister\u2019s damn drama and my younger sister\u2019s feelings. ESH in this so situation. I think everyone overreacting.", "INFO: Why do you hate your daughter?", "New account, troll comments.

Thank goodness I had a great aunt who stepped in like MIL here", "Makes me glad that even though I'm the middle, I'm also the only girl, so I had that to balance things out.", "Maybe for the most part. As the youngest I had the dubious honor of being the cause for all of my parents marital issues and \"preventing\" my father from being able to leave. Does it make sense to blame me for any of that? Nope. But that didnt matter. Now I'm the least favorite because I haven't expelled a child from my body.", "Or what middle child\u2019s supposed \u2018sin\u2019 is: mental illness? Lesbian? Personality clash? Neuro-divergent?\n\nI do wonder what medication middle is on that causes her to have mood swings. **Or** if she\u2019s on medication because she has \u2018mood swings\u2019 which are actually her trying to establish boundaries with her AH mother.", "I went and read all the clarifying comments. She isn't apologetic but I don't see where she intentionally took that sandwich to stick it to her middle daughter. She's probably grumpy over the middle's overreaction and feeling justified because of it.", "I\u2019m not sure if anyone else or it was just me that noticed, but if you were looking at a third eaten and a half of two different sandwiches, and you know the third eaten one is the one to take, wasn\u2019t it obvious to take the \u201cthird\u201d and not the half knowing the half is hers? I\u2019m a bit bad at measurements so please correct me if I\u2019m wrong", "You seem pretty certain it wasn\u2019t", "Yes you can.

Why would anyone say their CHILD, who isn't even fully developed , not need someone to listen and care about her feelings??? That's gross negligence", "Why are you so involved in this?

And I agree. There's so much more to this than the sandwich"]}
