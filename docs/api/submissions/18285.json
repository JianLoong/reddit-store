I wasn't upset when she got cancer last year.\n\nIt was looking pretty bad for a while, my aunt asked me to come see her so she could apologize, but I refused even then, which alienated a lot of my extended family.

Let's be clear, you're NTA (Not The A-hole). We're talking about a pretty major violation of trust here, and it's natural for you to feel anger and resentment.\r  \n\r  \nWhat happened was not a simple spat between cousins or a misunderstanding. It was theft, plain and simple, and it was committed by someone you considered close, practically a sister. That's a blow that's hard to recover from.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, and this is a big 'however', this situation isn't black and white. Your cousin's battle with cancer and her attempt at making amends have thrown in shades of gray that makes this a lot more complicated.\r  \n\r  \nShe's offered to pay you back, which suggests some level of remorse, and she's reached out, expressing a desire to make amends. That said, her being sick doesn't automatically absolve her of past wrongs. Forgiveness is not a right, it's earned, and it's entirely your decision if and when you're ready to give it.\r  \n\r  \nThe other piece of this puzzle is the family dynamics at play. The incident has clearly divided your family, and that's a burden you've been carrying. Your parents and sister suggesting you see your cousin could be an attempt to bridge this divide.\r  \n\r  \nSo, are you being cruel? From your perspective, no. You've been wronged and have every right to protect yourself from further hurt. But life has a way of throwing curveballs, teaching us hard lessons and sometimes leading us to unexpected growth.\r  \n\r  \nYou are under no obligation to forgive your cousin or to reconnect with her. That's a personal choice only you can make. But it might be worth considering whether holding onto this anger serves you in the long run. Sometimes, the act of forgiving isn't about the other person, but about freeing yourself from the pain and negativity associated with past events.\r  \n\r  \nAnd remember, forgiveness doesn't have to mean rekindling a relationship or forgetting what happened. It can simply mean letting go of the anger and resentment for your own peace of mind.\r  \n\r  \nWhatever you decide, I hope you find the peace you're looking for now.", "Bro nta she and your aunt STOLE from you.

But forgiving her just because she wants to not feel remorse? Let her demonstrate regret first, at least.", "NTA. \n\nForgiving her is a choice only you get to make. No one else decides whether it's worth your while. Your cousin wouldn't have earned mine yet; she can go out in the world, do good and show her new found integrity to others. If they believe her and she keeps it up, maybe I'd give her a chance to apologise and build a new relationship in a few years. \n\nYeah, my way requires resolve and ignoring family calling you hard and unforgiving; it also means you don't get burned again.

That is your right.\n\nI just want to make you aware that forgiving is not for the person who has wronged you, but for you. When you refuse to forgive, you are holding onto a lot of negativity, and it might slowly affect you and your life. \n\nBy forgiving her, you are letting go of all the negative feelings, emotions and actions that created this horrible experience.  AND you do not have to tell her that she is forgiven, because you are doing it for yourself. You are under no obligation to talk to her to make her feel better about what she did.\n\nIt may take more than one time, to truly forgive.  It may take years for you to forgive.

And I don't think you've justified that vote.", "she\u2019s had 5 YEARS to fucking apologize! she was 16, she knew better than to steal from her own family! also she didn\u2019t apologize until after she got sick so clearly that\u2019s playing a big part in her wanting to apologize now.", "So many assumptions in this post and thread!!! How are we supposed to know if the cousin is genuine or not. Obviously she should\u2019ve tried to make amends a long time ago but the possibility of death is a sure way to get things moving. Forgiveness is still OP\u2019s choice but she\u2019s holding onto a lot of anger and resentment and that can\u2019t bring her any peace. Ultimately, she should do what\u2019s best for herself but I don\u2019t think listening to what her cousin has to say is going to hurt. She can still forgive in her own time, even if that\u2019s decades later. What the cousin needs is to apologize for their wrongdoings, not to hear that they\u2019re forgiven for them. So I would say a soft YTA, not bc OP won\u2019t forgive her cousin but bc she isn\u2019t even open to an apology. Also, maybe consider a therapist bc holding the weight of a grudge like this can\u2019t be good for your mental health", "OP isn't preventing the cousin from paying her back if I'm understanding this right. The cousin could easily just have sent money to OP through extended family at any point and with no contact to OP. It's not petty that OP doesn't want to have contact with them again in my opinion.", "the cousin had 5 years to pay op back. it\u2019s not petty of op to not want the cousin\u2019s money now.", ">You have no obligation to welcome her with open arms into your life again, but the right thing to do is to give her the courtesy of hearing what she has to say and entertaining her request to be back in your life in some way.\n\nJFC! I REALLY WISH PEOPLE WOULD STOP TELLING VICTIMS TO SUCK IT UP.\n\nThe thief was 16, and that is well past old enough to know that stealing is bad. Stupid decisions have consequences and can't always undo the damage they've done.\n\nOP was victimized - not only in losing her money and half her clothes, but also in the trust and love she had for the thief", "We\u2019ll said! Cousin fucked around and found out that OP doesn\u2019t play. NTA. Thieves suck. Thieving close family members are the worst", "NTA\ncousin and her mother are thieving backstabbers who you're better off not having in your life. getting sick doesn't change that.", "Also, why hasn\u2019t the aunt apologized?", "The other thing is that people can forgive without resuming the friendship or former relationship.", "That last paragraph is important. None of the relatives were outraged about the robbery, but now they throw fits because OP refuses to accept the apology? Except for OP, everyone else in that family are AHs.", "The mother would have to be, right? The cousin would have been 16, while teenagers make some shitty decisions the fact that there was a grown-ass adult involved means the adult is responsible. Sure, the 16 year old should have known better (and OP is NTA for not allowing them back in her life) but that's got to be some horrible kind of pressure when your mom is telling you it's okay to steal like that.", "It honestly makes me wonder if the aunt was jealous of OP\u2019s mother and the life that she\u2019s able to provide for her family.", "It re-assholified him.", "I say look at like this when your cousin did you wrong everybody want play neutral but when they think you did her wrong they want go no contact. That shows you they never  even cared about her stealing in the first place.", "She needs to return your stuff regardless of whether you choose to forgive her or not, and tbh I don't blame you for not, she betrayed your trust for some money. Fuck money-obsessed people who sell their families for money, let the money save them and keep them company and heal them.", "Also please update us if you can, on whether she returned your stuff/money or not.", "100%. I hate people that say \u201cforgive and forget\u201d, \u201cbe the bigger person\u201d, \u201ctake the high road\u201d, when your the victim. Those types of people are weak.", "I agree. I will forgive for smaller things. Like, had a bad day and said some nasty shit? Apologize, dont do it again and we are good. But theft is a huge line for me. I don't care if its $10 of $150 dollars. Stealing is fucked up. And shows they don't give a shit about you. My friends now never stole from me. Some have even helped me count/move money when I needed it. Never took a penny from me. Cause they are good people.   \nPeople might get mad at you over your cousin but I think you are in the right.", "Thank you. Everyone is one CT scan away from a diagnosis.", "They have no idea what karma actually is and how to use it. They're just vengeful and like the one aspect of karma they understand that says bad things happen to bad people. Because then boom no effort required for you to be a strong, kind, good person yourself because you're justified in wishing others the worst and not striving to be the bigger and better person in harsh/difficult situations.", "Bless both of you. My faith in humanity was dropping looking at this sub. My blood was past boiling but going cold. The lack of critical thinking and empathy and the fervent dick str0king here is actually a case study.", "If cousin is expecting an apology in exchange for the money it's not remorse for her actions, it's extortion.", "you are 100% right.", "  It seems the cousin hasn't changed just because she's suffered an illness, and that's a real shame", "[removed]", "Yes it is not clear that the aunt has made any offer to repay or apologise.", "Exactly. I always get so angry at these types of \"apologies.\" If one was really remorseful they'd be proactive and reach out to make amends. Instead, their \"remorse\" is reactive, and hinges on the happenstance,  i.e., a chance meeting: \"Oh, by the way, sorry I stole your toaster 10 years ago\" or, they want something, as in this case, forgiveness.", "Chutzpah is the willingness to take risks in a highly shameless and confident manner, that's often seen as disrespectful or rude. For example, an entrepreneur who's running a small startup might display chutzpah by calling the CEO of a large company directly, despite having no invitation to do so.", "Yes but depending on her enviroment and upbringing she may not have understood the repercussions of such an act. Aunt is the AH in this story. \n\nCousin isn't great but at least she's trying. \n\nAnd for those saying nearly dying can't fundamentally change who you are as a person, you've clearly never been in that situation before. I wasn't a criminal or bad person but after being put in a near death situation, my entire outlook on life, relationships and the world around me changed.\n\nDownvote all you like but empathy can take you a lot farther in life than grudges can.", "As a childhood trauma survivor, I hate it so much when people spew this tired horseshit about forgiveness being for *you*, and anger being bad. \n\nFuck *that*. \n\nStay mad as long as you like, @OP. Being angry at the injustice done to you means you value yourself, and know you deserve better. Some people have to *fight* their way to the point they can be angry at the people who\u2019ve wronged them. That doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re dwelling on it all day, it just means you know well enough to tell them to eat shit anytime they come sniffing around with faux apologies to make themselves feel better.", "This is where I have a problem with the concept of karma\u2014bad shit happens, to both good and bad people. You didn\u2019t deserve getting cancer! I hate when people also credit God for healing their cancer. Did the parents of the 2 year old who died from cancer just not pray hard enough? It\u2019s all bullshit.", "Just accept that you're wrong.  No one deserves to get cancer, it doesn't matter how shitty they are.", "Seriously!!! Although it\u2019s a soft YTA for OP it\u2019s a hard YTA for almost everyone in the comment section for encouraging this way of thinking. OP at least has an excuse since she was the one wronged in the first place and I don\u2019t blame her for having a hard time with the whole situation", "And thus she Fucked Around and Found Out", "I could tell her exactly what I thought of her and tell her that any apology she gives will never be enough. But I'm petty and hold grudges.", "She was the adult and obviously helped plan it. She\u2019s just as much a thief as the cousin.", "Yeah, how does OP know that the aunt/cousin aren\u2019t trying to pull a long con to get back into OP\u2019s house and steal more stuff?\n\nOnce bitten, twice shy.", "(Partial) comment stolen from u/crockofpot \\- complete comment:\n\n>NTA. Cancer doesn't magically de-assholify people.  \n>  \n>What particularly stands out to me is how cold-blooded your aunt and cousin were about it: they clearly planned the theft ahead of time, and acted like nice trustworthy family members while planning to stab you in the back.

How could you trust your aunt and cousin are sincere now?", "  How could you trust your aunt and cousin are sincere now", "Good use of assuage.    \n\n\nI'm not a vocab bot but I act like one.", "This. And the same relatives are now upset with OP for refusing to let cousin back in her life?

I've had an incompetent doctor who gave me a medicine that made me dependent on it. Stopping it has resulted in me being sick for the past 6 months and I have no idea when, or if, I'd ever recover. Everytime I bring up how the doctor ruined my life with my family, they keep telling me to just let it go and all that spiel mentioned above. I don't know how I'm supposed to do that when I feel physically sick every waking moment, and I don't want to either. I reserve the right to hold onto my resentment towards the doctor! If I want to be bitter about it to my grave that's also my right! It doesn't mean I can't enjoy other things sometimes when I don't feel as sick, but especially when I'm feeling particularly sick, I want to be angry at the person who caused it.", "Modern medicine is what cures cancer, or at least puts into longterm remission", "I found a new term to add to my rich lexicon of swaer words! De-assholify is EXCELLENT! Thank you internet stranger!", "Yeah, these are people who had no problem rolling up to a young person\u2019s house to toss her room, then sell her stuff.

SMH", "A true living example of FAFO", "Exactly. Worse, they\u2019re siding with the relatives who actually committed a crime on another relative.", "Hahaha good!
