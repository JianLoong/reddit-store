Just return it first regardless, if you really have remorse, then wait to be forgiven.", "NTA. Cancer doesn't magically de-assholify people. \n\nWhat particularly stands out to me is how cold-blooded your aunt and cousin were about it: they clearly *planned* the theft ahead of time, and acted like nice trustworthy family members while planning to stab you in the back. Clothes and money can be replaced, but when trust is so pre-meditatedly shattered like that? How could you trust your aunt and cousin are sincere now?", "NTA. Your life your choice. To forgive and forget. Don't let family guilt you.  When you don't feel it.", "NTA, but I'd let her pay  you back - including interest and YOUR opinion on the value of the clothes. Tell her to do that and you'll hear her out.  Then once she pays you, decide if you want to hear her out or not.", "Keep to your boundaries. Just because she\u2019s sick doesn\u2019t mean she gets a pass. If she wants to apologise she can do so without seeing you but you definitely DO NOT need to let her back into your life. I do recommend you try to forgive her though, not for her sake, but for your own. \n\nForgiveness doesn\u2019t mean you let her back into your life, nor does it mean you have to have any sort of relationship with her. It means you let go of what happened and move on peacefully with your life. Forgiveness means you no longer feel anything (good or bad) for her and you\u2019re at a place of indifference. YNTA here and if your family want to make you feel a type of way then you set boundaries with them regarding the situation, but just because she\u2019s sick doesn\u2019t mean you have to forget about everything prior to her sickness. \n\nDo what\u2019s best for you !", "NTA \nYou\u2019re not obliged to forgive anyone unless/until you are ready to.", "NTA.

If so, do it for your own reasons, not because others are putting pressure on you.", "NTA. No one can demand you forgive someone. You've cut this person out of your life and thus want nothing more to do with them.\n\nYour aunt and cousins actions have consequences. One of these consequences is not having OP to lean on in times of need.\n\nIt's no ones fault but their own.", "NTA", "I want to say NTA. If someone, especially family, steals from you, and you know it, they deserve to be cut off.

First off, obviously she learned that stealing is ok from your aunt. Your aunt had no problem with it. And her getting cancer and wanting to make up to you, isn\u2019t for you. It\u2019s for her so she doesn\u2019t pass away with guilt, but it really wasn\u2019t that hard to not steal from you in the first place. Shame on your other family members for staying neutral on the situation. Stealing is stealing, even if it\u2019s a family member stealing from another family member", "NTA. Stealing, especially since it was **planned out** and **from someone related to her**, is an inexcusable crime.\n\nThis might sound harsh, but: Her contracting cancer is nothing but karma.", "NTA.", "NTA cousin needs to accept you don't want her in your life.", "NTA", "If she wanted to make amends she would have paid you back before she got sick. This is a show to get back at you for ignoring her with the other relatives who stood by and did  nothing when she robbed you.

At least get your money and clothing value and leave just like they did \ud83d\udc4d", "I can sense the deep hurt and betrayal you're carrying, and that's completely valid. Let's be clear, you're NTA (Not The A-hole). We're talking about a pretty major violation of trust here, and it's natural for you to feel anger and resentment.\r  \n\r  \nWhat happened was not a simple spat between cousins or a misunderstanding. It was theft, plain and simple, and it was committed by someone you considered close, practically a sister. That's a blow that's hard to recover from.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, and this is a big 'however', this situation isn't black and white. Your cousin's battle with cancer and her attempt at making amends have thrown in shades of gray that makes this a lot more complicated.\r  \n\r  \nShe's offered to pay you back, which suggests some level of remorse, and she's reached out, expressing a desire to make amends. That said, her being sick doesn't automatically absolve her of past wrongs. Forgiveness is not a right, it's earned, and it's entirely your decision if and when you're ready to give it.\r  \n\r  \nThe other piece of this puzzle is the family dynamics at play. The incident has clearly divided your family, and that's a burden you've been carrying. Your parents and sister suggesting you see your cousin could be an attempt to bridge this divide.\r  \n\r  \nSo, are you being cruel? From your perspective, no. You've been wronged and have every right to protect yourself from further hurt. But life has a way of throwing curveballs, teaching us hard lessons and sometimes leading us to unexpected growth.\r  \n\r  \nYou are under no obligation to forgive your cousin or to reconnect with her. That's a personal choice only you can make. But it might be worth considering whether holding onto this anger serves you in the long run. Sometimes, the act of forgiving isn't about the other person, but about freeing yourself from the pain and negativity associated with past events.\r  \n\r  \nAnd remember, forgiveness doesn't have to mean rekindling a relationship or forgetting what happened. It can simply mean letting go of the anger and resentment for your own peace of mind.\r  \n\r  \nWhatever you decide, I hope you find the peace you're looking for now.", "Bro nta she and your aunt STOLE from you. A was your friend and then she betrayed you. If you are no longer in their lives then why should you care. It\u2019s like caring for an extremely rude and selfish stranger. Why tf would you. Keep her and your aunt out of your life they\u2019re AHs", "Nta when someone hurts you they're not entitled to your forgiveness just because they feel really bad.", "NTA, cancer doesn\u2019t absolve a person from hurting you, it doesn\u2019t make your cousin a good person, it doesn\u2019t make you a bad person for not letting a liar and a their back into your life.", "NTA\n\nIf you find that the bitterness weighs on you, then forgive, but in your own time and because it is right for you.\n\nYou may want to remember that statistically, people who are able to forgive others are happier than others, so holding on to a grudge with both hands may be unhealthy for you. But forgiving her just because she wants to not feel remorse? Let her demonstrate regret first, at least.", "NTA. \n\nForgiving her is a choice only you get to make. No one else decides whether it's worth your while. Your cousin wouldn't have earned mine yet; she can go out in the world, do good and show her new found integrity to others. If they believe her and she keeps it up, maybe I'd give her a chance to apologise and build a new relationship in a few years. \n\nYeah, my way requires resolve and ignoring family calling you hard and unforgiving; it also means you don't get burned again. In my case, that's always meant the next time my eldest sibling fell off the wagon and threatened my life again. \n\nDo as you need. It's your life, and she fucked up the relationship; you owe her nothing.", "NTA", "NTA. what\u2019s done is done.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nI know you do not want to forgive, and you are very angry at your cousin.  That is your right.\n\nI just want to make you aware that forgiving is not for the person who has wronged you, but for you. When you refuse to forgive, you are holding onto a lot of negativity, and it might slowly affect you and your life. \n\nBy forgiving her, you are letting go of all the negative feelings, emotions and actions that created this horrible experience.  AND you do not have to tell her that she is forgiven, because you are doing it for yourself. You are under no obligation to talk to her to make her feel better about what she did.\n\nIt may take more than one time, to truly forgive.  It may take years for you to forgive. Your cousin violated your trust.  Your cousin betrayed you. You have every right to feel angry.  The question is do you want to hold onto the anger or let go? Only you can decide what is the best route.", "NTA", "Your feelings are valid.  Your decision is YOURS to make.  Family is important, but so is trust.  They really hurt you.  I\u2019m sorry for that.\n\nThis isn\u2019t an after-school movie, it is your real life and you should not allow others to guilt you into seeing her if you don\u2019t want to do so.  That would be victimizing you twice.", "NTA - people love to use sickness as an excuse. Cancer does not make you an angel or a saint all of a sudden and I\u2019m glad she pulled through, but you have every right to not want her in your life. If they could pull something like that, there\u2019s no telling what else they could do", "Specifically for this, NAH. It's great that she wants to apologize, but you don't owe her anything.", "This is a tough one.\n\nThe forgiveness isn\u2019t for her - it\u2019s for you. Your being the AH to yourself if you are carrying around this level of anger and resentment. \n\nForgiving doesn\u2019t mean letting people back into your life on the same terms - it\u2019s about letting go of the anger and moving on.\n\nYTA to yourself.", "I can't help but feel you're holding something back. The theft of your money and clothes, abetted by the aunt. That's strange, and hard to figure it was entirely random. \n\nAs for the rest, based in what you say so far, then YTA. You don't have to forgive her, but you should at least listen to see if she is genuinely remorseful.
