I assumed therefore that he would have got up and left already, but I turned over and he was still fast asleep. \n\nHere\u2019s where the dilemma comes in: I did think about waking him up, but I chose not to. My reasoning for this was the following: \n1) He has already missed the first 30 mins of the class, and even waking up now and leaving as fast as possible, he would likely miss another hour \n2) Historically, he has reacted rather grumpily towards me when waking him up in the morning, so I didn\u2019t want to face that \n3) It is ultimately his responsibility to wake himself up on time, if he chose to snooze his alarm, that\u2019s his choice \n\nAt 9am, he had an alarm go off, which woke him. When he checked the time he was obviously super annoyed that he had slept in and missed the start of his class. He got up and came to me, expressing his annoyance about having slept in (this is fine). \n\nI asked him what happened, like if he forgot to set an alarm, or his alarm didn\u2019t go off, or he just slept through it - all of these things happen sometimes and it\u2019s just life. He then tells me that he didn\u2019t set one, because his body clock usually wakes him up at the right time. \n\nAn important thing to say here is that my bf is not a morning person, he is absolutely more of a night owl, and naturally gets tired later in the day, and therefore also naturally wakes up later. This is fine, it just didn\u2019t make sense to me that someone like that would rely on their body clock to wake them up early when they usually naturally wake up at around 10am. \n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have asked this, but I asked him why he didn\u2019t set an alarm just in case. He had no response to this and instead asked me why I didn\u2019t wake him up. I told him points 1) and 3), but left out 2) as I knew this wasn\u2019t a good time to bring that up. He again had no response to this, but just stomped and huffed and puffed around the house while getting himself ready, make sure to swear under his breath while I was in earshot. After about 30 minutes, he left without even saying goodbye. \n\nHis behaviour before leaving the house suggests to me that he is mad at me for not waking him up, or at least directing his anger at the situation towards me even, though it\u2019s not my fault. \n\nAm I the asshole for choosing not to wake him up? \n\nTDLR: AITA because I didn\u2019t wake my bf up for his 8am class even though he chose not to set an alarm and I woke up after his class had already started?", "created_utc": 1698222734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g03rr/aita_because_i_didnt_wake_up_my_bf_for_his_class/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s not your responsibility at all- and who the heck doesn\u2019t set an alarm?!", "Ultimately it was his responsibility to make sure he was up for his class and him not accepting responsibility for his mistake and getting upset with you about it was entirely unacceptable.\n\nIt still would have been the supportive thing to do to wake him up when you woke up just in case he had slept through the alarm or such (because you didn't know at that time that he hadn't set an alarm).\n\nEither way NTA because it was his responsibility after all.", "NTA. He's supposed to be an adult. If he can set an alarm for 9am he should be able to manage one for 7.30", "NTA duh. He's 27, he's a grown-ass man. He can set his own alarm.

He owes you an apology as well", "NTA once he stops being a baby about the situation you should bring up his hostility at being woken up and why you were so hesitant. I assume this class was probably going to end around 930-10 so in getting ready and the commute he would have missed the majority if not all of it. He should set alarms? Like why have an alarm for 9am when your class is at 8??", "NTA. You have no way of knowing if he decided to skip the class, or what. Once it was past class start time, no reason to get involved.", "I ll go with ESH. He because he should have set alarm, you because you saw him overslept and even at 8.30 he did miss 1 hour but while you were counting reasons 1) 2) & 3)  he could at least get on second hour. I don't understand why people are in relationships if they are not ready to do even this small gestures(waking your partner). When we as people become so self centered even with partners we supposedly care about!??", "NTA\n\nThis man will be 30 years old in less than 3 short years. There are 27 year olds who are parents, teachers, lawyers, engineers, etc. 27 is old enough to know you need to set an alarm if you need to get up early and it\u2019s old enough to know you can\u2019t blame your girlfriend because you missed class.\n\nI naturally wake up between 5:30 and 6 and I still set an alarm every morning just in case and I set several alarms when I know I have to be up early for something. Is him blaming you for stuff a pattern in your relationship?

Would it have been nice for you to wake him up? Probably. Heck, you probably would have woken him up if he was more pleasant to be around.", "He was probably just mad at the moment. More to himself than on you. \nWould have been nice of you to wake him up and say you missed your class but also at the end it's his job.", "I\u2019m gonna go with ESH. Like yeah, *technically* it was not your responsibility to wake him up, but one could argue that *technically* it\u2019s not your responsibility to really do anything for someone that they can do themselves. But when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone, you\u2019re supposed to want to help one another and care for each other. \nIt would have been as simple as waking him up and saying \u201chey, I didn\u2019t hear an alarm go off for you and I don\u2019t want you to be late.\u201d If he gave you attitude, it would have been a good lead into the next conversation that needs to happen, which is \u201cplease set an alarm from now on because you don\u2019t respond very well to being woken up and I don\u2019t want that to cause issues between us, I don\u2019t deserve attitude for helping you with something.\u201d\nI feel like you probably knew what his response was going to be and wanted to be smug about it to be \u201cright\u201d and that\u2019s not a great way to treat someone you\u2019re supposed to care about. \nAnd on his end\u2026 he\u2019s a grown ass man who needs to set an alarm. From now on, he better do this, you\u2019re not his mommy.", "NTA, you should've included point two when he asked you, he's a child though.", "ESH. Yes, it's his responsibility to wake himself up. But you should have woke him up when you realized he slept in, and then had a conversation with him about setting alarms. I get why he's irritated. But he didn't he handle it correctly either, which is why ESH.", "Gently, YTA. You are not at fault for him missing his class, not setting extra alarm or anything else like that - he is a big boy, should do this himself. But the moment you woke up and saw him he was late you should have woken him too. That's just care for the other person. We all make mistakes, but if you have a partner you hope you have one that has your back to help you when you make one. You didn't have his back this morning.", "I'd go with ESH (but with a 90-10 ratio on his part). Naturally it's his responsibility and not setting an alarm is damn stupid but not waking him up when you know it's important to him is assholish as well. Also you knew he'd be mad at you for not waking him up, so you did it on purpose.", "NTA for the alarm and everything you did,  and that's my judgment, but you're kind of being one in general with this stuff:\n\n>ust stomped and huffed and puffed around the house while getting himself ready, make sure to swear under his breath while I was in earshot. After about 30 minutes, he left without even saying goodbye. \n\n>His behaviour before leaving the house suggests to me that he is mad at me for not waking him up, or at least directing his anger at the situation towards me even, though it\u2019s not my fault. \n\nReading this I get no sense that he actually grumbled at you, just that he grumbled and you interpreted it to be at you.  You say he made sure to swear when you were in earshot; can't you give the benefit of the doubt and assume he was swearing the whole time, and you only heard the ones when you were in earshot? You assume his grumpy behavior means he is mad AT YOU rather than just mad in general. That's not very fair.\n\nI say you're kind of being an AH in your relationship if you make it a habit to assume the worst from your SA. Now if he comes out and SAYS he's mad at you over this, that's another thing entirely.", "it is usually his job to wake up, but in hindsight you could have him a jab \"yo sleepy head it 830 you know\". and all the jazz wouldnt have happend. NTA", "NTA for not waking him up. He has to be responsible for his own actions. He should know himself and set an alarm if his natural clock isn't performing well lol. Waking him up would have been nice, but it's not your responsibility. \n\nYTA for nagging him, asking what happened when you very well know what happened. He knows he made a mistake and you do not need to remind him and treat him like a child.", "ESH\n\nMy husband and I will wake each other up if one of us oversleeps. It doesn't happen often, but we're human.\n\nYou could have helped him out and woke him up and talked about it later.\n\nHe's a grown ass man and should have set an alarm.\n\nIs this normal for him? Does he often rely on you to remind him of things or was this a one off?", "YTA- Why would you not help out your boyfriend? This is so weird.", "ESH everyone\u2019s guessing what this dude is feeling, reading the tea leaves from the description in the original post. OP describes not communicating because of a fear of a reaction. Everyone in this scenario needs to communicate better. \n\nYes, boyfriend made bad choices all throughout this exchange. He needs to step up and take responsibility. And OP, be direct and clear. Reasons 1 and 3 are bullshit. Reason 2 sounds a lot more like the truth since it\u2019s the one you refused to share and seems to be driving force. Deal with the real issue in your relationship like the grown-up everyone in this thread is telling you your boyfriend needs to become.", "ESH, I'd say. He should have set an alarm and taken responsibility for waking himself up. So he messed up. And I understand you not wanting to bring up how he's grumpy when you try to wake him, but by not mentioning that I get the impression that what you told him when he complained about you not waking him up was essentially \"You'd already missed some of your class and it's your own damn fault\" which I can understand he'd be offended by. \n\nIt sounds like this is something you should be able to work through together by talking about it when you're both somewhat calm. Hopefully he'll understand and accept that your second reason, him being an AH when woken, was your stronger reason for not doing so. And hopefully he'll realise that he needs to set his own clock.\nIf he's still stubborn and blaming you during such a conversation, I'd say he's the A.", "Yta, he fucked up sure, but you woke up right next to him knowing he has overslept and just fucked off and let him sleep even longer.", "Yes, mild YTA. You knew he overslept, all you needed to do was to spend a minute on waking him up. His alarms, his planning etc. is not your responsibility or your business, no need to talk about it, but doing something that literally costs you nothing is within the bare minimum of necessary care between a couple.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Waking up at 8:30 would have meant that by the time he got ready and travelled there the class would be almost over, so why bother? Let him get the sleep that he clearly needed. I do get people\u2019s argument that I could have tried to be supportive by waking him up anyway as soon as I realised what was going on so he could decide himself what to do.

I have mentioned this to him before, but pretty much straight up denies it. So I think that\u2019s why I was hesitant to bring it up again, especially when tensions where already high. I would like to bring it up later when we are both calm.", "I think you\u2019re right that I should talk to him about this later when we have both calmed!

Maybe he already knew that and I didn\u2019t need to say anything, but this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done something like this, so maybe I felt that something had to be said. \n\nDefinitely don\u2019t think I went about that in the best way.", "I have tried to tell him this in the past, but I am met with the comment that I am trying to make him like me (someone who naturally prefers to sleep a little earlier so I can get enough sleep to get up earlier)\u2026", "This is a lot!

I am scared to check if he\u2019s mad at me. If he\u2019s not, then I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll get mad that I assumed that. If he is, I\u2019m worried he\u2019ll get mad because I should have known. I am also scared to call him out on his behaviour, for fear of his response. I did call him out today, I did tell him that hey you should have set an alarm and it\u2019s not my responsibility, in the nicest way possible. He didn\u2019t seem to take that well, but it has been pointed out to me that I might just be assuming he\u2019s mad at me when he\u2019s not.

I do have several set already, and am trying my best to make sure I will be up on my own, but if you notice that I'm somehow still asleep when you wake up, please wake me up.\"\n\nHe needs to at least _try_ to wake up on his own, and can't blame you for not doing something he _never even asked you to do_.", "Fair point. I think I just feel like I\u2019m expected to think of both of us, but he can\u2019t even be bothered to think for himself, let alone of me.", "In general you are definitely right. But I am sorry, not taking proper measurements to be on time for something and than being pissed at your partner? That ball is definitely in BFs corner. It would be different if BF had asked to help to wake him up! But he is 27 and doesn't want to set an alarm and thinks his body alone will do the trick? OP isn't his mom and he isn't a school kid anymore.\n\nEven if OP had woken him on 0830 he would still be too late. So it's not fair to be grumpy at OP when he did the mistake.", "Same here. I think his reaction is crap honestly, but she also bears a little blame for not supporting the dude in the first place", "He asked her why she didn't wake him up. That is putting it (i.e., the onus of waking him up) on her!\n\nHis behaviour does suggest he's mad at her. If I'm leaving the house while mad at a situation, I always tell my partner \"sorry I'm grumpy/annoyed/frustrated/irritable/upset, I'm mad at the situation and myself, not you. I love you, see you later\" or something like that. Even if I'm in a rush.", "my bad, i didn\u2019t read grumpy as outright hostile. but if it weren\u2019t for that it would be a shit thing to do, and him already being late is not an excuse. so i guess i\u2019m changing my vote, since that was your main reason. esh.", "Sounds like a plan", "The purpose of addressing problem behavior is to prevent it from happening again.", "You\u2019re NTA, his negative reactions means no favors. He can learn to control himself.", "I hear you. The thing is, and as you know, there is always going to be anger; it's just part of the gig. How you respond to it is the issue. As far as talking to your bf, you may not have been able to say what's true for you because you were afraid of his reaction. One thing you could do is write a script and practice it beforehand. As far as therapy goes, some therapists have a sliding scale, and there may be online options that could serve you.", "You are the reason why marriages fail, people like you who has no idea what a relationship is, specially marriages. Imagine not knowing ANYTHING about this man or hes relationship, but only one very minor argument they had in the MORNING and the first thing you advocate is to break up and call him a loser ?\n\nJesus Christ, please dont give advice when you cant even help urself.", "It has been pointed out to me that I might be making some unfair assumptions, so that\u2019s something for me to think about. I will probably chat with him this evening just to check how he\u2019s feeling.", "Angry with himself, but taking it out on her with his stomping around and leaving without so much as a good bye, have a good day. Excellent emotional management skills. /s", "Yeah agreed that if he asked me to wake him up, I would have done so 100%. Or like if his alarm woke me up but not him, I would have woken him up then too.", "Yeah, he said something about having an early class, and somehow expected you to understand that he is asking for you to wake him up, without doing anything at all to wake himself up or make sure he is awake on time. That is absolutely horrible communication, and weaponised incompetence. \n\nDo not let him convince you that you should have known, or should have swooped in to help.", "Agreed. but that is a different problem.  IF he is too lazy to think for himself or for you then it's an unbalanced relationship which I don't advocate for, but it does not change my opinion on how a relationship should work.  People should help each other.  If you guys are not helping each other then you have a different problem and you need a different solution.", "Not disagreeing with you.  You are right some steps should be taken when you want to call yourself an adult and he was not behaving like an adult, but I am not talking about how juvenile or naive he was I was just stating how a relationship should work. Just my 2 cents.", "\"You were awake, why didn't you wake me up?\"\n\n\"By the time I woke up, it was already too late by that point for you to get there for the class.  And it's your responsibility to get yourself up on time.\"\n\nBoyfriend (chastened) mutters to himself under breath, dresses and leaves apartment.  \n\nAggressive\\_Cloud2002 (from balcony) \"He owes you an apology!\"", "Okay maybe that\u2019s my bad phrasing! Maybe I should be specific that the grumpiness/slight hostility is very much at me rather than the situation of having to wake up when your body wants more sleep.", "\"Problem behavior\" = \"being annoyed with oneself for one's own actions\".\n\nNowhere did OP say he did ANYTHING directed at her.  The dude \"cursed under his breath\" in earshot of his girlfriend in an apartment and \"huffed and puffed\" while getting ready and \"left without saying goodbye.\"  And OP says this behaviour \"suggests\" that maybe he's angry with her...", "Not so much as even a \"this is partially your fault!\" and he's \"taking it on her\"...", "That seems quite reasonable! You can't read his mind, or know what he needs from you unless he asks. Maybe remind him of that!", "This is something him and I could talk about for sure!", "Yes, if you are starting tit for tat, the relationship is doomed. A relationship should be us vs them and not you vs me.", "He should still apologise for the first bit!"]}
