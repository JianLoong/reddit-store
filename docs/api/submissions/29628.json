I assumed therefore that he would have got up and left already, but I turned over and he was still fast asleep. \n\nHere\u2019s where the dilemma comes in: I did think about waking him up, but I chose not to. My reasoning for this was the following: \n1) He has already missed the first 30 mins of the class, and even waking up now and leaving as fast as possible, he would likely miss another hour \n2) Historically, he has reacted rather grumpily towards me when waking him up in the morning, so I didn\u2019t want to face that \n3) It is ultimately his responsibility to wake himself up on time, if he chose to snooze his alarm, that\u2019s his choice \n\nAt 9am, he had an alarm go off, which woke him. When he checked the time he was obviously super annoyed that he had slept in and missed the start of his class. He got up and came to me, expressing his annoyance about having slept in (this is fine). \n\nI asked him what happened, like if he forgot to set an alarm, or his alarm didn\u2019t go off, or he just slept through it - all of these things happen sometimes and it\u2019s just life. He then tells me that he didn\u2019t set one, because his body clock usually wakes him up at the right time. \n\nAn important thing to say here is that my bf is not a morning person, he is absolutely more of a night owl, and naturally gets tired later in the day, and therefore also naturally wakes up later. This is fine, it just didn\u2019t make sense to me that someone like that would rely on their body clock to wake them up early when they usually naturally wake up at around 10am. \n\nMaybe I shouldn\u2019t have asked this, but I asked him why he didn\u2019t set an alarm just in case. He had no response to this and instead asked me why I didn\u2019t wake him up. I told him points 1) and 3), but left out 2) as I knew this wasn\u2019t a good time to bring that up. He again had no response to this, but just stomped and huffed and puffed around the house while getting himself ready, make sure to swear under his breath while I was in earshot. After about 30 minutes, he left without even saying goodbye. \n\nHis behaviour before leaving the house suggests to me that he is mad at me for not waking him up, or at least directing his anger at the situation towards me even, though it\u2019s not my fault. \n\nAm I the asshole for choosing not to wake him up? \n\nTDLR: AITA because I didn\u2019t wake my bf up for his 8am class even though he chose not to set an alarm and I woke up after his class had already started?", "created_utc": 1698222734, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g03rr/aita_because_i_didnt_wake_up_my_bf_for_his_class/", "score": 348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Would it have been nice for you to wake him up? Probably. Heck, you probably would have woken him up if he was more pleasant to be around.", "He was probably just mad at the moment.

Like yeah, *technically* it was not your responsibility to wake him up, but one could argue that *technically* it\u2019s not your responsibility to really do anything for someone that they can do themselves. But when you\u2019re in a relationship with someone, you\u2019re supposed to want to help one another and care for each other. \nIt would have been as simple as waking him up and saying \u201chey, I didn\u2019t hear an alarm go off for you and I don\u2019t want you to be late.\u201d If he gave you attitude, it would have been a good lead into the next conversation that needs to happen, which is \u201cplease set an alarm from now on because you don\u2019t respond very well to being woken up and I don\u2019t want that to cause issues between us, I don\u2019t deserve attitude for helping you with something.\u201d\nI feel like you probably knew what his response was going to be and wanted to be smug about it to be \u201cright\u201d and that\u2019s not a great way to treat someone you\u2019re supposed to care about. \nAnd on his end\u2026 he\u2019s a grown ass man who needs to set an alarm.

You are not at fault for him missing his class, not setting extra alarm or anything else like that - he is a big boy, should do this himself.

You say he made sure to swear when you were in earshot; can't you give the benefit of the doubt and assume he was swearing the whole time, and you only heard the ones when you were in earshot? You assume his grumpy behavior means he is mad AT YOU rather than just mad in general. That's not very fair.\n\nI say you're kind of being an AH in your relationship if you make it a habit to assume the worst from your SA. Now if he comes out and SAYS he's mad at you over this, that's another thing entirely.", "it is usually his job to wake up, but in hindsight you could have him a jab \"yo sleepy head it 830 you know\". and all the jazz wouldnt have happend. NTA", "NTA for not waking him up. He has to be responsible for his own actions. He should know himself and set an alarm if his natural clock isn't performing well lol. Waking him up would have been nice, but it's not your responsibility. \n\nYTA for nagging him, asking what happened when you very well know what happened. He knows he made a mistake and you do not need to remind him and treat him like a child.", "ESH\n\nMy husband and I will wake each other up if one of us oversleeps. It doesn't happen often, but we're human.\n\nYou could have helped him out and woke him up and talked about it later.\n\nHe's a grown ass man and should have set an alarm.\n\nIs this normal for him?

This is so weird.", "ESH everyone\u2019s guessing what this dude is feeling, reading the tea leaves from the description in the original post. OP describes not communicating because of a fear of a reaction. Everyone in this scenario needs to communicate better. \n\nYes, boyfriend made bad choices all throughout this exchange. He needs to step up and take responsibility. And OP, be direct and clear. Reasons 1 and 3 are bullshit. Reason 2 sounds a lot more like the truth since it\u2019s the one you refused to share and seems to be driving force. Deal with the real issue in your relationship like the grown-up everyone in this thread is telling you your boyfriend needs to become.", "ESH, I'd say. He should have set an alarm and taken responsibility for waking himself up. So he messed up. And I understand you not wanting to bring up how he's grumpy when you try to wake him, but by not mentioning that I get the impression that what you told him when he complained about you not waking him up was essentially \"You'd already missed some of your class and it's your own damn fault\" which I can understand he'd be offended by. \n\nIt sounds like this is something you should be able to work through together by talking about it when you're both somewhat calm. Hopefully he'll understand and accept that your second reason, him being an AH when woken, was your stronger reason for not doing so. And hopefully he'll realise that he needs to set his own clock.\nIf he's still stubborn and blaming you during such a conversation, I'd say he's the A.", "Yta, he fucked up sure, but you woke up right next to him knowing he has overslept and just fucked off and let him sleep even longer.", "Yes, mild YTA. You knew he overslept, all you needed to do was to spend a minute on waking him up. His alarms, his planning etc. is not your responsibility or your business, no need to talk about it, but doing something that literally costs you nothing is within the bare minimum of necessary care between a couple.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And that\u2019s what I did.", "You\u2019re not the only one to mention that he may have been expecting me to wake him up instead of an alarm. I don\u2019t know why, given that he usually doesn\u2019t like me waking him up\u2026 hence my not doing so\u2026 I also told him I planned to wake up at 8am, which is when his class started, so I\u2019m not sure what world he would have been living in to think that I would wake up an hour sooner especially to wake him up\u2026 \nIf that is genuinely the case then yes I am honestly quite concerned.", "I will be mentioning at a later stage.", "Totally valid. Others have said the same, so I definitely plan to clarify if he was actually mad at me or not.", "Legendary way to deal with a mistake honestly.", "I\u2019ll admit that wasn\u2019t great timing. Honestly I just didn\u2019t know how to respond to him expressing his frustration about something that he did to himself.", "He doesn\u2019t naturally wake up that early. He naturally wakes up at like 10. I don\u2019t know why he thought his body clock would just know that he has to do wake up 3 hours earlier.", "I will say this situation has given me a little bit of an ick.", "I will admit I have tried to bring up that his sleep habits are not conducive to anything positive, and I have tried to be firm but fair about it, but I just get the response that I\u2019m trying to make him like me. Maybe I need to talk to him differently, maybe there is no talking to him.", "That\u2019s what it comes down to, I don\u2019t want to be an adult for 2 people, one is plenty!", "Yeah I maybe need to get better with some extra conflict in the moment, with the hopes that it\u2019ll lead to less conflict down the line.", "As someone who is neurodivergent myself, I don\u2019t find that to be an excuse. It\u2019s valid to ASK for extra help, especially if you\u2019re doing all you can and it still sometimes isn\u2019t enough. But in this case he didn\u2019t even do the bare minimum of setting an alarm himself, and expected me to wake him up without asking me beforehand.", "I think this is also very fair!", "Your BF sounds like he doesn't want a GF, but a mommy. Instead of taking personal accountability, he blames you?", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s not a child. He is a 27yo grown adult. If it was so important to him that he get to class on time, he should have set an alarm. Relying on his unreliable body clock and then blaming you for his own mistake is an AH move. \n\nIs he always like this? Not self-aware of his own short comings and habits? If someone is not a morning person and a night owl, the sensible thing is to set an alarm if they have something important to attend to in the morning. It doesn\u2019t matter whatever reasons you have for not waking him up. \n\nYou are his partner, not his mother. I would have a chat with him and tell him all the reasons you\u2019ve stated, as well as how immature he behaved when he blamed you for not waking him up. It\u2019s not something you should have to put up with.", "NTA and honestly my response would have been that I didn\u2019t wake him up bc I\u2019m not his mom.", "I'd say run!  Not only are you already afraid of waking him up, but then this happens? Temper? Red flags.  It's only downhill if this is the real him coming out.  You'll end up married to this never ending sh*t.  I wouldn't listen to anyone who sounds like they have to do emotional gymnastics to defend herself non stop.", "NTA.  He's 27, not 7.  It's his sole responsibility to wake up and go to class.  If it was so important you would think an adult would have planned better, or planned at all.", "Seriously. It's one thing if it's really important and you set multiple alarms and ask someone to wake you up *as a backup plan*, it's another to believe your biological clock will go off on its own.", "That\u2019s great that you made it out of immaturity. But it\u2019s never a good idea to be in a relationship where you\u2019re counting/waiting/ on the other party to change significantly in order to make the relationship equitable or tenable.

You\u2019re the lucky exception not the rule.", "okay but alternately what if his class had been cancelled and he\u2019d already woken up and decided to go back to sleep, he\u2019d probably ream OP a new one for waking him up then. his responsibility. my own partner hates being woken up with such a passion that i\u2019ve been in similar situations. never mad at me, just oh shit i\u2019m late. bf is lame and immature, can\u2019t have it both ways (don\u2019t wake me up but wake me up when i don\u2019t wake up)", "Yeah, to me that's the main thing that makes the BF far more of an AH. \n\nMy husband can fall asleep anytime, anywhere, and sometimes he's passed out for the night before setting his alarm. My \"internal clock\" always gets me up at least an hour before him, and I've always just found it kind of a natural thing to nudge him awake if necessary. \n\nBut if he was a hostile jerk to me *when I was doing him a favor*, uh, no. Wake your own damn self up then. That's the biggest red flag to me here.", "But you probably aren't in the habit of being rude to each other when you wake each other up. If you were, maybe you wouldn't be inclined to give as much of a fuck whether your partner is going to make it to the gym that day.

Then maybe OP should think about other things in her relationship. But I doubt he would have time to yell at her for waking him if he quite literally overslept - he would be scrounging to get out of home. Either way, not waking him is an issue of not supporting him.

You should seriously consider leaving because that\u2019s starting to sound like he\u2019s moving out of the honeymoon phase and letting his mask down. \n\nBased on other comments, he\u2019s been relying on you to do basic things for him that most adults (barring some health conditions or a long-term disability) should do for themselves. He\u2019s been acting aggressively when things aren\u2019t going his way. Cussing and slamming around and leaving without a word? That\u2019s not just being mad at yourself. My biological father does that and it\u2019s to be abusive.", "oh yeah in that case NTA", "Real talk, I don't think it's that he doesn't like you waking him up- I think it's that he is perfectly comfortable being a jerk to someone when he's grumpy or taking out his frustration on you. \n\nI've also always hated to get up in the morning, and when I was still in grade school, my father used to make sure I got up. As much as I loathed being awake, I never took it out on him once I was older than about 7. \n\nAt 33yo, I set 3 alarms to make sure my ass is up when I need to be. Based on your comments, imho it seems like he absolutely expected you to wake up earlier than normal, just to wake him up. If he was able to set an alarm for 9am, despite saying he expected his \"body clock\" to do it, he should have been able to set one for 7am. \n\nIs he like this with other things? Because if he's still throwing tantrums at 27, he's not likely to get better. Stomping around and swearing, specifically in your earshot to make sure you know he's angry with you, is beyond immature. \n\nIt's also not your job to manage his emotions for him. I had a narcissistic mother, and 20+ years of emotional abuse conditioned me to be the person who *did* try to manage other people's emotions, and bend over backwards when they passive aggressively told me they were displeased.\n\nWhich is exactly what he's doing. \n\nAt this point in my life, I make sure everyone in my life knows that I *do not respond to subtext*.

When we actually get out there, he\u2019s much more enthusiastic than I am! \n\nThe problem is that to actually get us out there, I feel like I am the SOLE driving force, despite me not even really liking running myself. I do it every Sunday regardless of whether he is around, but he only does it when I\u2019m there nagging him to come with me. He kept saying that he wants to run more, like during the week as well, but somehow always finds an excuse not to, but until I say I wanna go (or AM going), and actually start getting ready to go myself, he doesn\u2019t make the effort. \n\nRunning is just an example. The point is that I hate feeling like I\u2019m the sole driving force for literally anything in the relationship. I can\u2019t help but feel like if I wasn\u2019t there all he would do would be sit and watch YouTube, eat shit, and procrastinate his assignments until the final moment. Me not waking him up today was honestly a symptom of that I think. I don\u2019t want to feel like I am doing his life for him. Who\u2019s going to do my life for me then?", "Hahah, keep telling urself that, one day you might believe it.", "To be fair, that is practically *all* men if they don't have a woman or the want of a woman to drive them. It's like that Internet meme of a bed on the floor, a TV/monitor, a PC/Xbox/ps5, and some pizza \"Men really think it's ok to live like this?\" The answer is well yeah, as long as we also get to participate in a healthy relationship. Most women aren't ok with that set up, so most guys while they don't see a problem with it, won't live like that because they want a woman more.", "I'd love to keep you entertained since you seem so bored, u/DefintlynotCrazy, but I have a lunch date with my husband. You have a great day, bud \u263a", "Are you really telling me men don\u2019t have goals or passions for themselves if it doesn\u2019t pertain to getting or keeping a woman they want? I know that\u2019s the meme about like home decor and stuff bc men tend to not care about that. But do they really not care about ANYTHING? I find that hard to believe. \n\nFurther, if what you\u2019re saying is true, it still doesn\u2019t apply here. He has a woman to drive him, to \u201cwork for\u201d, to be motivated and inspired for. But he isn\u2019t, and that\u2019s where the issue is. He can\u2019t seem to get motivation from anywhere, except me literally holding his hand and almost putting one foot in front of the other for him.\nI\u2019m being a bit dramatic I\u2019ll admit but that is really how it feels. I\u2019m happy to motivate and inspire and give reason, I\u2019m not happy to get as physically possible to doing it for him.", "YTA\n\nYou let him oversleep even though you knew he should be awake. Instead of being helpful you just asked him dumb questions that was just like twisting the dagger. \n\nInstead of asking, \n\n\u201chey, babe is there anything k can to help you?\u201d\n\nYou asked\n\n\u201cWhy did you oversleep? Why didn\u2019t you set an alarm?\u201d\n\nHuuuuuge AH.", "Like you said its ultimately his responsibility not yours, however once you woke, you should have waked him up, that is, despite the grumpiness, the decent thing to do. The rest is his problem. SO NO YOU ARE NOT TA", "NTA\n\nYour BF is an adult, it's his responsibility to wake himself up.  It might be different if you were also getting up at 7 AM but you weren't, and like you said, you woke up AFTER his class had started.", "NTA, he could\u2019ve at least set an alarm", " **I did think about waking him up, but I chose not to.**\n\nDo you even like your boyfriend?  Sounds like this relationship has hit it's \"sell by date\".   \n\nESH   You, obviously, because you chose to be petty instead of just being a decent person and waking him up  Him for thinking he has a body clock and not setting an alarm. \n\nHonestly, the two of you sound exhausting.", "NTA cause is not your responsibility but really shitty of you not waking him up when you noticed he was already late.", "NTA. Whole ass grown up, internal clock or not I always set an alarm just in case. And now he\u2019s solely relying on you? Absolutely not. \nMaybe you could/should have woken him up anyway and let him decide if he was okay with missing class or not, but still NTA here. put an alarm. He \u2018a not a kid and you\u2019re not his mother.", "NTA, for the reasons you listed. \nI saw your post a couple of weeks ago about your boyfriend dismissing your concerns about not being able to sleep due to his snoring, and I have to be honest here - I sincerely hope the way you describe his reaction in that post and in this post makes you really think about your relationship. So far I see him blaming you for his own behavior, being hostile towards you, ignoring your concerns and outright telling you he doesn\u2019t care about your problems.", "NTA\u2026because it\u2019s not your job to get him up. He\u2019s an adult\u2026or at least old enough he should be one\u2026and getting your dumb ass outa bed and to class is a personal problem, not an OP problem.", "Girlfriend or mother, which do you prefer?", "Nta. The simple fact that he didn\u2019t even attempt to be responsible should absolve you of all potential guilt.", "NTA. He is a grown adult. Older than you. Why is it your responsibility, not his, to wake him up for his lecture? You're not his mother.", "ESH\n\nIt WAS his responsibility, but you still should have woken him up when you saw he was asleep. Such a small thing to do. If he gets so angry when woken up that you don't want to do it because of his reaction, then you should break up.", "NTA\n\nPoint 3 is the only point that matters. It's HIS class, it's HIS responsibility to make sure he wakes up on time. At his big age this should be common sense. It would be different if he set an alarm and slept through it, or hit the off instead of the snooze, it would have been nice for you to wake him, but it is still his responsibility. Period.", "YTA\n\nHe told you that he needed to wake up, so, as a considerate partner/roommate, you should have gone ahead and woken him up a bit. You didn't have to drag him out of bed or anything, but even yelling at him a bit would have been enough that you would have tried.", "NTA point 3 covers it sll", "NTA. \n\nSure, it\u2019s a kind thing to do to if he wasn\u2019t a jerk about it in the past, but overall, he\u2019s a grown ass man. If it\u2019s important to him, he can set an alarm.", "You're not his mommy. NTA.", "NTA he's an adult he can set a damn alarm.", "It is his responsibility but I mean you are his girlfriend", "NTA. Nothing further because your bf is a grown up and should be responsible for his own schedule and life.", "NTA It's his job to wake himself up. My sister is similar when she gets woken up, she swears and grumbles cause she hates waking up. I tell her to get over it and get up, platonic or romantic, that's what you should be able to do in a relationship. If he reacts negatively to you telling him that, it's a huge red flag and you need to start looking for more. Being pissy itself isn't bad, it's how he handles that pissiness. I know I can tell my sister to get over it and she won't hold it against me, you should have that same security. Also I'd be pretty bothered if my partner didn't wake me up knowing I had a class, so I relate to that, but I'd get over it pretty quick knowing it was my own dumbass fault.", "NTA. I had a bf once who got super mad at me. It was ALL my fault yadda yadda. Just like your point 3, I pointed that out to him. Oh well bro. Be an adult.", "He needs to learn from his own mistakes, you wouldn\u2019t be doing him a favour", "NTA. 2) and his behaviour is giving me the vibe that you're walking on eggshells - is this how he usually reacts to situations?\nIf he couldn't make it to most of the class, then not waking him up does make sense. \nI'm a night owl and not setting an alarm before a class sounds...insane to me. If he cared so much he could've woken up himself.", "Man am I tired of hearing about women having to wake up their grow ass husbands and boyfriends. NTA", "NTA\nHe\u2019s an adult. He made a choice that didn\u2019t work out for him. He did not ask you to make sure he\u2019s up, therefore none of this falls on you. \n\nFWIW, my husband sets an alarm every night that he has to get up in the morning. In the 15 years I\u2019ve been waking up with him, I my twice has he slept til the alarm. His body really does wake him up. *But he has the alarm set just in case.* This is what personal responsibility looks like.", "No. No the a", "You're not responsible for him waking up or getting to class on time. He's an adult and that's all on him.", "NTA, though a quick nudge of \"hey babe, don't you have a class to get up for?\" would have been nice. I suspect you mainly didn't wake him up for your reason #3, but who knows.\n\nWhen you say he's been grumpy about you waking him up in the past, was he grumpy because he wanted to sleep in? Because that makes sense. I assume he wouldn't be grumpy if you woke him up for something important.\n\nEdit: you mentioned elsewhere that he has been hostile towards you for waking him up for something important that he overslept for. Tbh I think he needs to know that so that in the future (when you don't wake him up again) he'll know why.", "Your boyfriend is a bloody adult he can set a damn alarm clock\n\n\nOP nta", "NTA, that is a grown ass man he needs to set an alarm if he wants to be awake. I naturally wake up at a certain time everyday but if I know I need to be up even if it's after the time I naturally wake up, I set an alarm.", "Dang, I missed the ages. I was picturing a 19 or 21 year old. Yeah, he needs to grow up.", "personally, my classes are about an hour and 20 minutes long. i wouldve assumed his class would be over by the time he actually gets there", "If someone responds with anger every time you wake them, I wouldn't want to wake them up anymore either. Maybe, if he wouldn't be such an ass, OP wouldn't be afraid of waking him up", "You didn't know that his lecture didn't get cancelled or that he did not choose to skip it. This is why if I have an important thing I always make sure to explicitly tell people to please wake me up (if they see me sleeping past some time when I should have woken up). If I don't tell them, that's on me.", "uhm no. hes a grown ass man and is more than capable of setting an alarm and getting himself up for school.\n\nhe has no one to blame for being late, but himself.\n\nare yuou his mother? no. then you dont need to get him up unless you want to. sorry but np, your not obligated to get him up for class.", "Are you scared of him??\n\nedit: If so, there is probably a reason. Please, listen to your gut, which knows what it's talking about.", "I'm gonna be honest, if you're afraid to tell him about point #2, that's a red flag itself", "Um, unmarried people get pregnant EVERY DAY", "but you knew he has somewhere to be. im sorry are you guys a team or an enemy?\n\nsure, there are thing i dislike my bf does and i may have some complaints, but regardless of what i feel if i know my bf has something important, and im aware, doesnt matter if i was asked or not, but im aware and i could do something, i would. instead you just look at him and be like oh well, whatever. gir, what?\n\nalso. this story is reposted ive seen this stupid story a while back, but whatever, the point isnt the reality of it but as a topic of discussion.", "She did it in the past, so bf expected she would do it again. We create an expectation about future behavior through our past behavior.", "Uh no. Don\u2019t assume people are going to fix your irresponsibility every time. What she did in the past was a favor. A kindness. It is beyond narcissistic and entitled to expect it every time.", "I am reading between the lines a bit.  But when someone doesn't want to wake someone up due to past behavior and is sensitized to the other person's anger such that they assume it's their fault,  it is reasonable to ask a few questions.\n\nA lot of us aren't morning people.  As adults, we don't expect others to wake us up.  We also don't wander around swearing and being unpleasant to people all morning long because we fucked up.\n\nHe may just be an immature, irresponsible jerk.\n\nI wouldn't want to be around that, either."]}
