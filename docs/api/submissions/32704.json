Robert tells me that they barely got to class on time. I also give him a ride back to the house. Christian talks to his friends after school for like 10 minutes and wastes me and Robert's time, when we want to get back to our house. Christian makes the argument that Robert just \"leaves early\". So I told him if he wants to get rides from school then he has to get ready by 7:25 and leave after the bell rings. Christin told his parents that I was being unreasonable which is totally rude because we are doing you a favor and you continue to waste our time.

It is not the same thing.  Not even close.\n\nThat is why adults set expectations with other adults who are responsible for the child.  Everyone communicates together and then when expectations are not met, the agreement ends altogether so there is not a situation where a minor child's parents have no idea if he will or will not get to school any given day.", "Yah.

Establish that you will arrive at his house at 7:20 and your son will text him, but that you will leave at 7:25.  A five-minute window is reasonable.  Once everyone is on the same page, and the parents are involved, you may find that Christian is on time.

Don't bring an attitude to this or put Christian in a place that causes issues because you do not want this to affect your son, and kids can be real jerks to one another.", "Agreed on the \"good age to learn a lesson\" but with the minor child's parents as part of that.  Doling out lessons to kids that you are taking a temporary responsibility for while not keeping the parents in the loop is a recipe for disaster.  He is NOT the parent.  He must have the kids parents involved in this issue.", "As a teacher I agree that it is correct to discuss it with Christian directly.

Tell them that you leave at 725 and if he\u2019s not in the car by then then too bad.", "If you want to be nice?  Get Christian a ten buck used Huffy and tell him the Uber ride is over.", "Not your problem.  He can be on time.  Your time. Or he can walk.  NTA.", "That\u2019s when the issue lies, you were too vague. The correct instruction is, when I a passing your house at 7.25am a you are not outside waiting for me then I will assume you are not needing the lift to school. Same scenario at end of school", "This is way too indecisive.  Tell his parents that you leave at 725, end of story.", "So you don't need to \"wait outside his house\" if he isn't standing on your driveway when you are ready to leave, you go without him.", "I had to take a 10 min train ride to my HS.   \nI was a teenager, with a \"teenager brain\" ;)  \nAnd, surprise, surprise - I still managed to be on time for the train (mostly ;) ).   \nIt's not OP's responsibility. It's Chris' responsibility.", "It. Is. Not. Your. Job. To. Avoid. Abandoning. Him.   \n\n\nThat's co-dependency there. He is not your child. He is not a young child, full stop. He is not being abandoned if he misses his ride to school. He's just up for a longish walk. He'll be a bit late. It's on him to deal with the ramifications.   \n\n\nYou aren't helping this young person by treating him like you should be responsible for him getting to school. You are literally holding him back from learning and from becoming a man, independent and able to take responsibility.", "Why OP should be at Christian's house at 7.20 AND texting him?  \nChristian should be waiting outside of OP's house at 7.20, if he wants to get a ride to school.   \nIf he's not there at 7.20, OP should assume that he doesn't want a ride - so simple.   \nI was co-commuting to job in the other town with my two colleagues (had no car). I was waiting in the place we agreed on the given time. If I wasn't there, they just  were going without me."]}
