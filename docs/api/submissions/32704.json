BTW Robert is my son, and the neighbor's kid is Christian. Early in the school year I offered to drop Christian off because its a 30 minute walk to school and I wanted to be nice. But now there's a problem, School starts at 7:35 with a 5 minute passing period to get to class. And I wait outside his house at around 7:23, Christian takes his sweet ass time to get in our car and by the time we get there the bell has already rang, This has happened so many times. Robert tells me that they barely got to class on time. I also give him a ride back to the house. Christian talks to his friends after school for like 10 minutes and wastes me and Robert's time, when we want to get back to our house. Christian makes the argument that Robert just \"leaves early\". So I told him if he wants to get rides from school then he has to get ready by 7:25 and leave after the bell rings. Christin told his parents that I was being unreasonable which is totally rude because we are doing you a favor and you continue to waste our time. I think Im the asshole because I make Christian walk for 30 minutes in the morning and afternoon in the Arizona heat. Also because I demand him to get ready by MY standards and it only benefits me and Robert.

Making you stressed and your son potentially late day after day is not okay.", "NTA. He practically makes your kid late. I'm guessing the school disciplines students who are late. To me, that's a bigger deal than the 10 minutes after school but you're doing Christian and his parents a favor.\n\nHe can either show up on time or walk.", "NTA. Christian is a rude little shit and unless your son and Christian are good friends you should stop giving him rides altogether.", "If he's not standing at your car door when you leave for school, he missed his ride. After school, if he's not at the curb, he's on shoe leather home.", "NTA - If he doesn\u2019t wanna walk that long in the mornings then he should be ready standing at his front door waiting for you. Also you shouldn\u2019t have to wait on him talking to people when he is getting out, let him walk and talk to them on his way home.", "NTA. I would have told him the exact same thing.

You have no obligation to him. You're not \"making\" him do anything. He has the option to: 1) adhere to your schedule and get a ride; or 2) not adhere to your schedule and walk home.", "NTA he\u2019s being entitled and completely rude and disrespectful", "NTA-If someone is doing you a big favor you give them the courtesy of operating on their time frame.", "NTA.

Did you tell them when he kept breaking the rules that you would no longer give him rides, or did you just leave forcing him to walk?\n\nIf you failed to communicate the details to the parents, then that just was not very forward thinking, and could have helped in your case, when you tell the parents you cannot continue to help him with rides.\n\nIf you just drove away when he didn't come out on time before or after school, then again, that is a passive-aggressive approach that does sort of make you an a-hole.  You should have given him a ride and then afterward, when the parents were home, walked over and just explained that he continues to break the rules, making your son late, or causing you to get home late after school, and it's just not going to work.", "No your in right. Some people's kids are just raised to be lazy,  also just some teenagers in general.  I would tell his parents that hey I'm sorry but my family and I also have places to be so if he doesn't come out when he's supposed to that's on him and he walks,  your not his parent.", "NTA he is being incredibly rude of your time if it was my I wouldn\u2019t let you give him a ride if he was making you late or not coming to your car after school in a timely manner. You\u2019re doing him a favor.", "What the heck here? YTA, for waiting this long. The first time Christian didn't show up at 7:23 on the dot, you should have been OUT OF THERE. Why did you set the precedent that the neighbors' child gets to set your own child up for failure in school?  (You do realize that the school is likely punishing your son for this, right? His academics are getting affected because you are acting like an Uber instead of a person doing a huge favor for your neighbor.)   \n\n\nYou are the adult. Stop posting asking reddit, which is also largely made up of teen agers, and be the adult here. You pick the time. You pick the terms. Christian can take you up on them or not. You aren't parenting Christian or punishing him. You just aren't available at 7:26.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You were doing him a solid favour, but he was completely unappreciative. Let him walk. If he wants to catch a lift with you again, let him apologize in a way so that you know he has your point. And don't ever let him make you wait again. If it is 30 minutes to walk, he can take his bike. That would be 15 minutes at the most.", "I have been in your situation and you are NTA. My neighbour's kid made me late for work. If he wants a ride badly enough, he'll be ready on time.", "Nta .... seems like the kid runs his house at home too! Parents cant stick up to him.... at least someone can.... him doing that to you is totally unreasonable considering you are doing him a favor and he just being alittle dick to you.", "NTA.  This kid is disrespectful of you and your time.  He just doesn't care and he doesn't appreciate that you are driving him and saving him from walking back and forth to school.

You are doing Christian a solid favor. He is taking advantage of you. Rule of thumb... You honk the horn, Christian comes out and gets in the car. If he doesn't, then he walks. End of day, wait 5 minutes Christian gets in the car or he can walk home. Easy.", "NTA. AT ALL!   Free rides means the rider has to be ready when the ride shows up.  Christian not being ready means the ride is not important enough to him to be ready on time, so he in essence is choosing to walk.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have to take him. He is a teenager he should be able to get ready on time.", "NTA. Besides being on time, Christian needs to be appreciative to you, polite when in your car, and always respectful to your son. He is at an age to learn that relationships, including those with people who have the power to help you, are valuable and worth the effort.", "Don't bother to pick him up. He's your neighbor.  Let him know what time you leave each morning and say you'd be glad to take him to school if he wants to walk over and join you.  Same in the afternoon.

The saying is: \"You're never late for the ferry - you're just really early for the next one\"", "I didn't mean he had to be exactly out of the house by 7:23 but around that because That's when I would like to drive my son to school.

Im saying he is wasting out time even telling him but I get what you mean", "Roberts my son:-:", "I grew up in AZ and did the 30 min walk to and from school. It's a pain, but I was also the person in charge of giving my younger siblings rides to school once I got my license. I was leaving at x time. I'm not being late or sitting in a scorching hot car while they chatted with their friends. They could have the ride or they could walk. Their choice. The only time I made exceptions was for dust storms or monsoon.", "It doesn't matter where his parents are.\n\n\"I will depart your house at [X] time. If you are not in the car at that time, you don't get a ride.\"\n\nThat's totally reasonable.

I think that\u2019s how my second conversation with them would sound if the situation didn\u2019t rectify itself. But coming demanding and adversarial puts you in the opposite side of the table from his parents. They didn\u2019t do anything, they probably don\u2019t even know, no need to be stern with them. The goal is to be in the same side of the table as this parents, it\u2019s not you vs them. It\u2019s you and them vs the kid.\n\nIf he sees that they on your side, he\u2019ll get his shit together.", "And also, never tell a teen anything vague like 7:25-ish.  The \"ish\" part makes it subjective.  Be exact.", "Did you tell his parents, or are you basically in a situation where it is his word against yours when his parents get involved?", "Buses, trains and planes are public transit with schedules.  There is no implied obligation established as what occurred when this adult offered to do a favor for a child.\n\nThis is an adult making an agreement with a minor who still has ten years of brain development left until he is at the same cognitive level as the adult.  It is not the same thing.  Not even close.\n\nThat is why adults set expectations with other adults who are responsible for the child.  Everyone communicates together and then when expectations are not met, the agreement ends altogether so there is not a situation where a minor child's parents have no idea if he will or will not get to school any given day.", "Yah. Let that sink in. You are literally playing games with a 15 year old who isn't your kid.   \n\n\nYou decide to let him waste your time. Not him. You. You're the adult.", "My apologies, i meant Christian! Edited it to fix", "I didn't tell his parents because it's about Christian and being prepared. I just told Christian to be on time if I'm bringing him to school. His parents aren't apart of his morning routine but Christian told his parents about it.", "> Buses, trains and planes are public transit with schedules \n\nSchool starts according to schedule.  \n\n> This is an adult making an agreement with a minor who still has ten years of brain development left \n\nAnd a good age to learn lessons.", "Your saying just because he is a minor means its ok for him to fuck up? My son knows better then him and a year younger", "It's not that I was letting him be late, I still wanted to drop him off but I was annoyed at this constant being late close to bell. I didn't want to abandon him so I still waited for him.", "Alright.  That's your mistake.  He is a minor.  You should have been in conversation with the parents from the onset, and now that Christian has brought them in, I would recommend that you go talk to the parents and Christian together with a nice tone of voice and just be matter-of-fact.  Establish that you will arrive at his house at 7:20 and your son will text him, but that you will leave at 7:25.  A five-minute window is reasonable.  Once everyone is on the same page, and the parents are involved, you may find that Christian is on time.  He may even have friendly reminders or calls from grateful parents for your help.\n\nBUT BE WARNED.  Don't bring an attitude to this or put Christian in a place that causes issues because you do not want this to affect your son, and kids can be real jerks to one another.", "Agreed on the \"good age to learn a lesson\" but with the minor child's parents as part of that.  Doling out lessons to kids that you are taking a temporary responsibility for while not keeping the parents in the loop is a recipe for disaster.  He is NOT the parent.  He must have the kids parents involved in this issue.", "As a teacher I agree that it is correct to discuss it with Christian directly. He is plenty old enough to understand the deadline and consequences of missing it. Since he brought his parents into it, you of course need to repeat the information accurately to them so there is no misunderstanding. NTA"]}
