It\u2019s publicly frowned upon in my country but my parents always had a more progressive and western view. I don\u2019t share all their beliefs but I agree that it is not up to me to judge how a stranger lives his life if it doesn\u2019t affect me.\n\nMy parents have always been close with another couple (Kolya and Vika). When Kolya and my father were doing their mandatory military service my mother and I moved in with Vika. We still live very close to them and see them almost daily.\n\nOn saturday I was at a friend\u2019s birthday. He lives closer to Vika and Kolya\u2019s flat and I usually just sleep there instead of walking all the way home (it\u2019s also safer because our neighborhood can be a bit dangerous at night especially if you're drunk and tired). I had asked Vika if I could sleep there again and she said she wouldn\u2019t be there but it would be no problem.\n\nTheir guest room is located behind their room so I had to go through the bedroom to get there. When I went by the bed I saw 2 people sleeping in there. One was Kolya and the other was my father. They weren\u2019t wearing a shirt. I didn\u2019t think right at that moment and just went to the guest room.\n\nThe next day they were both in the kitchen and eating breakfast. I asked why my father was here and he said he will explain when we go home. It was uncomfortable atmosphere.\n\nAt home my mother apologized because I wasn\u2019t meant to find out that way but they both forgot that I was sleeping there. She explained that they sometimes met with Vika and Kolya to have sex.\n\nIt was a shock to hear because I always saw them as aunt and uncle. I told them that I need time to get my mind around it. \n\nThat was 3 days ago and the longer I\u2019m thinking about it, the more it makes me uncomfortable. When I think about interacting with them it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI asked my aunt and uncle if I could move in with them for some time. They said it would be fine and I could move in with them this weekend. My cousin (who is very westernized) asked me why I wanted to move in with them and I told her what happened. She said I shouldn\u2019t be so prejudiced and that it was non of my business what they are doing in the bedroom. \n\nBut I disagree because this affects me and it does make me uncomfortable so I don\u2019t want to stay with them at this time. What they are doing is unnatural and I don't want to be near that.\n\n\nEdit: I'm a 15 year old girl. And I do not think that homosexuality is unnatural. I meant that my parents are betraying their marriage vows by having sex with other people is unnatural\n\nI need to make some things more clear:\n- I'm not moving out forever. My parents and I talked and decided it would be best if I spend some time away. I love them very much but I just need some space now\n- my father and Kolya were sleeping. It was 4 in the morning and I tried to be quiet and get to the guest room\n- I was not fully drunk. It was a friend's birthday and we celebrated. Technically I'm not allowed to drink but my parents and all my friends' parents let us do it if we are responsible", "created_utc": 1693407253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165gxp4/aita_for_wanting_to_move_in_with_my_aunt_and/", "score": 2659, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot believe the amount of you lecturing a 15 year old for being uncomfortable they caught their parents swinging. Being uncomfortable with your parents sex like in *general* is normal, let alone trying to wrap your mind around swinging. To you, you view it as cheating. That is your personal belief, and considering this is your parents, I find it totally normal that this would upset you.\n\nAt the end of the day, it isn\u2019t your business to know about. But knowing information you shouldn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean it gets automatically deleted from your brain, nor does it require you to accept it.\n\nYour job as the child is to respect your parents wishes, and you do that by not shaming them or asking them to stop. That\u2019s their decision. Choosing to live in another household because their sex life makes you uncomfortable is your decision, and one I feel you are absolutely entitled to. \n\nNot sure why the world has decided to constantly pick if being uncomfortable is justified or not. You can\u2019t say anything to them because youll make them uncomfortable, but them making you uncomfortable is okay? Smh.

That's hard to wrap your head around. All that being said, they weren't parading it in front of you. They weren't even planning on telling you yet. You found out by accident in a surprising way.

Now that you know, there are all sorts of relationship shifts that might occur. I will believe you when you say that it's not the same sex relationships that are what you are calling unnatural, it's the polyamory. The thing is, that's not unnatural.

Nobody wants to particularly think about their parents\u2019 sex life, particularly at 15. Having it thrusted in your face like this is a lot and has probably scrambled your image of your parents. It\u2019s fine to take time out to come terms with this. It\u2019s only as you get older do you stop seeing your parents in that one dimensional role but as people in their own right.  Also you start seeing all the shades of grey life has to offer. \n\nYour parents don\u2019t seem to be breaking the sanctity of their marriage, they simply have it on different terms to the traditional one.

Things related to the parents always have and will affect the child, especially when they are 15.

If you're an adult it's still weird but could be seen as a sign of respect for them to trust you with that. It already sounds like they're trying to be discrete but mistakes happen and at least they didn't try to lie to you. \n\nUltimately you do have to remember that your parents are people too. If they're happy, healthy, and with a solid marriage then you should be happy for them. Consider how hurtful it would be for them to have you leave, regardless of the reason.

It\u2019s publicly frowned upon in my country but my parents always had a more progressive and western view. I don\u2019t share all their beliefs but I agree that it is not up to me to judge how a stranger lives his life if it doesn\u2019t affect me.\n\nMy parents have always been close with another couple (Kolya and Vika). When Kolya and my father were doing their mandatory military service my mother and I moved in with Vika. We still live very close to them and see them almost daily.\n\nOn saturday I was at a friend\u2019s birthday. He lives closer to Vika and Kolya\u2019s flat and I usually just sleep there instead of walking all the way home (it\u2019s also safer because our neighborhood can be a bit dangerous at night especially if you're drunk and tired). I had asked Vika if I could sleep there again and she said she wouldn\u2019t be there but it would be no problem.\n\nTheir guest room is located behind their room so I had to go through the bedroom to get there. When I went by the bed I saw 2 people sleeping in there. One was Kolya and the other was my father. They weren\u2019t wearing a shirt. I didn\u2019t think right at that moment and just went to the guest room.\n\nThe next day they were both in the kitchen and eating breakfast. I asked why my father was here and he said he will explain when we go home. It was uncomfortable atmosphere.\n\nAt home my mother apologized because I wasn\u2019t meant to find out that way but they both forgot that I was sleeping there. She explained that they sometimes met with Vika and Kolya to have sex.\n\nIt was a shock to hear because I always saw them as aunt and uncle. I told them that I need time to get my mind around it. \n\nThat was 3 days ago and the longer I\u2019m thinking about it, the more it makes me uncomfortable. When I think about interacting with them it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI asked my aunt and uncle if I could move in with them for some time. They said it would be fine and I could move in with them this weekend. My cousin (who is very westernized) asked me why I wanted to move in with them and I told her what happened.

Haven't heard about something dangerous happening to them either, worst you can get is an unpleasant comment about it, but it's the same amount of risk as in every other European country.\n\nClearly none of you are russians (judging on your coment history and active communities on Reddit), so please stop supporting big bad russian barbarian stereotype and stop spreading misinformation.\n\nSource: I am russian, know some poly couples", "Anywhere that\u2019s the not US.", "me too dude", "I think the only assholes here are the people in the comments trying to make a 15 year old girl comfortable with a sexual situation she finds uncomfortable", "Also, that it seems shocking and not right to the daughter, implies the parents have not expressed positive or liberal attitudes towards sex and alternative relationships in her upbringing. So likely, there\u2019s a feeling of hypocrisy on the part of the parents, as she has been raised a certain way and now finds out parents doing otherwise but that she wasn\u2019t supposed to find out.\n\nNTA. She\u2019s 15, how is she expected to react? Her view of her family and their relationships has been turned on it\u2019s head.", "It's almost like an unfathomably large and globe spanning series of communites isn't a monolith.", "If she had gotten there earlier she very well could have walked in while they were fucking each other", "I don\u2019t think homosexuality and poly relationships are the same . Of course it\u2019s not true or everyone,  l but I think  that being homosexual for most of society is seen as normal. I don\u2019t think the same can be said for poly relationships. That might change at some point. But for now I think it\u2019s seen by most in society as immoral or abnormal behaviour", "Where I come from it is absolutely normal to view very close family friends as family, like aunts/uncles.

And you leaving someone who is doing something you don't want to be around is the correct approach (rather than forcing them out or insisting they stop). NTA.", "NTA.

You have every right to do so.", "NAH", "Exactly she\u2019s a teenager who\u2019s now is faced with her parents open/poly marriage and their also Bi or pansexual lifestyle. And the people they are having sex with have been like family to her. It\u2019s a lot to deal with, at any age. Her parents even forgot she was going to be there. It must have been a huge shock.

Don't think I have to elaborate further", "No, not everyone has to validate other people's feelings.\n\nJust stay respectful, you can be judgemental as long as ur respectful to them as humans.\n\nShe doesn't have to accept this, she has her own life and her own opinions. Not everyone has to follow your moral compass. Stop virtue signaling.\n\nYou don't have to accept things you don't want to, you can stay neutral and that works wonders in your life. You can get along with everyone that way.\n\nI don't support LGBTQ nor do i condone it. I have friends who are part of the community.

There are emotional relationships amongst the adults, it\u2019s not just about sex", "Hi, child of parents that were openly in a throuple for about a decade here. It was fine and didn't and still doesn't bother me. People are so dramatic about this shit and just like to judge from their ivory towers to make themselves feel morally superior.\n\nLike why would I give a fuck about my parents sex life? It's none of my business. Personally I think it's because people, and especially here, don't really treat parents like people, they see them solely as their roles and not as individuals.\n\nAnd to be clear it's fine for OP to be uncomfortable and need time away to process, hell it's healthy even. Clearly they do care so even if I think it's dramatic (but they're a teenager so to be expected) it's clearly what they need to come to terms with this.\n\nClear NAH, though that would change if OP starts telling everyone. Especially if it's a country where that would put them at risk.", "Relax beast, OP has obviously been taught the simple concept of marriage being between 2 people.

Including each other. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d be uncomfortable to find out dad gets pegged by mom, or mom likes to be spanked, or mom and dad watch granny porn together. Because children aren\u2019t supposed to find out about their parents\u2019 sex lives.\n\nThis is it. I'm a grown adult who is a certified queer leftist (TM). I think people should have whatever sex they want to or don't want to as long as consent is present. And I still get super grossed out if anything regarding my parents' sex life crosses my mind (ew).  \n\nThere's nothing wrong with OP feeling initially grossed out that her parents are swingers. However, wanting to move out because of this is extreme. I'll chalk it down to a teenage overreaction. I think NAH as long as OP doesn't continue to make an issue about it. \n\nSlightly concerned that the top comment seems to imply that OP would be in the right for wanting to move out. Also, the comments arguing that swinging is immoral. Even if it was, that's not grounds for a minor to move out of their home. OP is not being abused or neglected here.", "Homosexuality immoral? No. Abnormal? No. Polyamory abnormal? No. Polyamory immoral? Well for a 15 year old kid, whose idea about marriage is probably 2 people in an exclusive relationship? Very much can be seen as immoral. I tend to stick to everyone does what they want, but I feel polyamory as morally ambiguous, as it's basically \"permitted cheating\" (strong word, but that's the best I can express).
