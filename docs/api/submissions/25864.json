It\u2019s publicly frowned upon in my country but my parents always had a more progressive and western view. I don\u2019t share all their beliefs but I agree that it is not up to me to judge how a stranger lives his life if it doesn\u2019t affect me.\n\nMy parents have always been close with another couple (Kolya and Vika). When Kolya and my father were doing their mandatory military service my mother and I moved in with Vika. We still live very close to them and see them almost daily.\n\nOn saturday I was at a friend\u2019s birthday. He lives closer to Vika and Kolya\u2019s flat and I usually just sleep there instead of walking all the way home (it\u2019s also safer because our neighborhood can be a bit dangerous at night especially if you're drunk and tired). I had asked Vika if I could sleep there again and she said she wouldn\u2019t be there but it would be no problem.\n\nTheir guest room is located behind their room so I had to go through the bedroom to get there. When I went by the bed I saw 2 people sleeping in there. One was Kolya and the other was my father. They weren\u2019t wearing a shirt. I didn\u2019t think right at that moment and just went to the guest room.\n\nThe next day they were both in the kitchen and eating breakfast. I asked why my father was here and he said he will explain when we go home. It was uncomfortable atmosphere.\n\nAt home my mother apologized because I wasn\u2019t meant to find out that way but they both forgot that I was sleeping there. She explained that they sometimes met with Vika and Kolya to have sex.\n\nIt was a shock to hear because I always saw them as aunt and uncle. I told them that I need time to get my mind around it. \n\nThat was 3 days ago and the longer I\u2019m thinking about it, the more it makes me uncomfortable. When I think about interacting with them it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI asked my aunt and uncle if I could move in with them for some time. They said it would be fine and I could move in with them this weekend. My cousin (who is very westernized) asked me why I wanted to move in with them and I told her what happened. She said I shouldn\u2019t be so prejudiced and that it was non of my business what they are doing in the bedroom. \n\nBut I disagree because this affects me and it does make me uncomfortable so I don\u2019t want to stay with them at this time. What they are doing is unnatural and I don't want to be near that.\n\n\nEdit: I'm a 15 year old girl. And I do not think that homosexuality is unnatural. I meant that my parents are betraying their marriage vows by having sex with other people is unnatural", "created_utc": 1693407253, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165gxp4/aita_for_wanting_to_move_in_with_my_aunt_and/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I cannot believe the amount of you lecturing a 15 year old for being uncomfortable they caught their parents swinging. Being uncomfortable with your parents sex like in *general* is normal, let alone trying to wrap your mind around swinging. To you, you view it as cheating. That is your personal belief, and considering this is your parents, I find it totally normal that this would upset you.\n\nAt the end of the day, it isn\u2019t your business to know about. But knowing information you shouldn\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean it gets automatically deleted from your brain, nor does it require you to accept it.\n\nYour job as the child is to respect your parents wishes, and you do that by not shaming them or asking them to stop. That\u2019s their decision. Choosing to live in another household because their sex life makes you uncomfortable is your decision, and one I feel you are absolutely entitled to. \n\nNot sure why the world has decided to constantly pick if being uncomfortable is justified or not. You can\u2019t say anything to them because youll make them uncomfortable, but them making you uncomfortable is okay? Smh. It\u2019s not about you, but it IS your parents, and to say that it has no effect on you is ignorant to psychology..", "NTA as I interpret the not natural to mean not being monogamous which is more common.\n\nThe more I read about children from parents with open relationships, the more I think that they should have worked harder to hide it.

That's hard to wrap your head around. All that being said, they weren't parading it in front of you. They weren't even planning on telling you yet. You found out by accident in a surprising way. It hadn't impacted your day to day life prior to you finding out, so was anyone being hurt here? \n\nWanting to spend a little time away to wrap your head around a new piece of knowledge that has to do with your family and friends is fine. Now that you know, there are all sorts of relationship shifts that might occur. I will believe you when you say that it's not the same sex relationships that are what you are calling unnatural, it's the polyamory. The thing is, that's not unnatural.

Nobody wants to particularly think about their parents\u2019 sex life, particularly at 15. Having it thrusted in your face like this is a lot and has probably scrambled your image of your parents. It\u2019s fine to take time out to come terms with this. It\u2019s only as you get older do you stop being your parents in that one dimensional role but as people in their own right.  Also you start seeing all the shades of grey life has to offer. \n\nYour parents don\u2019t seem to be breaking the sanctity of their marriage, they simply have it on different terms to the traditional one.

Things related to the parents always have and will affect the child, especially when they are 15.

Cut him slack. \nKiddo you're entitled what are you feeling, hope you are doing okay.", "INFO how old are you?\n\nIf you're a child then they shouldn't be telling you about their swinging. If you're an adult it's still weird but could be seen as a sign of respect for them to trust you with that. It already sounds like they're trying to be discrete but mistakes happen and at least they didn't try to lie to you. \n\nUltimately you do have to remember that your parents are people too. If they're happy, healthy, and with a solid marriage then you should be happy for them. Consider how hurtful it would be for them to have you leave, regardless of the reason. If you're willing to talk with them about it you could possibly come to a solution that works for everyone.

It\u2019s publicly frowned upon in my country but my parents always had a more progressive and western view. I don\u2019t share all their beliefs but I agree that it is not up to me to judge how a stranger lives his life if it doesn\u2019t affect me.\n\nMy parents have always been close with another couple (Kolya and Vika). When Kolya and my father were doing their mandatory military service my mother and I moved in with Vika. We still live very close to them and see them almost daily.\n\nOn saturday I was at a friend\u2019s birthday. He lives closer to Vika and Kolya\u2019s flat and I usually just sleep there instead of walking all the way home (it\u2019s also safer because our neighborhood can be a bit dangerous at night especially if you're drunk and tired). I had asked Vika if I could sleep there again and she said she wouldn\u2019t be there but it would be no problem.\n\nTheir guest room is located behind their room so I had to go through the bedroom to get there. When I went by the bed I saw 2 people sleeping in there. One was Kolya and the other was my father. They weren\u2019t wearing a shirt. I didn\u2019t think right at that moment and just went to the guest room.\n\nThe next day they were both in the kitchen and eating breakfast. I asked why my father was here and he said he will explain when we go home. It was uncomfortable atmosphere.\n\nAt home my mother apologized because I wasn\u2019t meant to find out that way but they both forgot that I was sleeping there. She explained that they sometimes met with Vika and Kolya to have sex.\n\nIt was a shock to hear because I always saw them as aunt and uncle. I told them that I need time to get my mind around it. \n\nThat was 3 days ago and the longer I\u2019m thinking about it, the more it makes me uncomfortable. When I think about interacting with them it makes me uncomfortable. \n\nI asked my aunt and uncle if I could move in with them for some time. They said it would be fine and I could move in with them this weekend. My cousin (who is very westernized) asked me why I wanted to move in with them and I told her what happened.

Because children aren\u2019t supposed to find out about their parents\u2019 sex lives. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the parents are wrong to have a sex life.\n\nAt the end of the day the kid has to understand their parents are adults with a life beyond parenting them, and not all of it is sfw. It doesn\u2019t make them bad parents.", "Idk, I dated a guy whose parents were swingers. They did it for a while until they got a divorce bc someone caught feelings. \n\nHer parents are fucking people she considered family, not even random people she doesn\u2019t know. Which changes a LOT", "Where on the marriage certificate is her name?", "> They made vows to be with each other\n\nAre they no longer with each other? sounds like they're still fully with each other and have come to the decision of who to sleep with *together* so I fail to see who has been betrayed. You keep saying \"their marriage\" as if their marriage is a person who exists who is neither of your parents. But your parents have not betrayed each other.", "You said what they were doing is \"unnatural. \" Marriage isn't a part of nature, and polygamy exists in nature. There is nothing inherently unnatural about it even if most people wouldn't want that sort of relationship.", "[deleted]", "Your parents' marriage is not a person that can be betrayed. It's an agreement between your parents.\n\nIt's not the agreement you thought it was, which I get can be a shock at first, but again, no one was lied to, or betrayed by this.\n\nYour parents have not left each other. They're still together. Them having sex with your honorary aunt and uncle doesn't nullify that, and therefore doesn't break any vows they made to each other.\n\nUnless you're telling me your country's marriage ceremony literally includes the phrase \"We swear to never have sex with anyone but each other\".", "> hey are betraying their marriage\n\nThey are their marriage. If the marriage works for both of them, then there's no betrayal.", "You are running into a reddit phenomenon which does not reflect reality.  \n\nPolyamory is not mainstream no matter how much the ultra sex positive people want to pretend it is.\n\nIt is valid if that is what works for them, but the average person looks down on those who participate in that lifestyle, which the poly community really doesn't like.  So where they have purchase (here), they push back hard on that.", ">What makes you think he is referring to it being homosexual\n\nBecause he bring specifically the subject of homosexuality multiple times throughout the post, but he never wrote anything specific about non monogamy. When people are pissed, what really pissed them off come up regularly in the conversation.\n\nBut I'll give him the benefice of the doubt and it's because of the non monogamy. He would still the asshole. Nobody like to hear or know about their parent sex life, doesn't mean we want to leave home and break our relationship with our parent just because we might hear that they like it in the ass, or have a weird fetish.", "Well, it\u2019s her life. And you\u2019re just a redditor so.. She can feel how she wants.", "Don't have children if you won't care about their mental and physical well being.", "I guess as a parent, there\u2019s certain things I wouldn\u2019t do. But everyone\u2019s different\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026", "No disrespect but I think we all know anecdotal evidence isn\u2019t ever considered when having disagreements, whether they be online or in person. \n\nThey were likely so close BECAUSE of their special relationship, it seems to have been going on for a while. Whether it will succeed or fail lies on the individual, we can\u2019t really just take our own experiences and say that will happen to them too. There are plenty of successful swinger couples and polyamorous couples out there after all.", "Yeah, it makes it honestly less like \"swinging\" and more like a committed polyamorous relationship that's lasted between four people for like, a decade at least? This isn't a new relationship between two couples even if it's new for OP. I really don't understand how that's disrespectful to the children?", "They're a fucking child. They're permitted to be uncomfortable when faced with the sexuality of their parents, especially with these circumstances.", "I wonder if her parents are gay but had to marry each other bc the country is homophobic", "Yea still have to disagree sorry.\n\nYou have a responsibility as a parent not to be doing that stuff around your children.\n\nThanks for your opinion tho.", "Go back and reread that first comment by u/SledgeLaud, because you literally brought the argument back around to the same thing they originally replied to you about. No one's saying she can't feel how she feels about it, which is squicked out. Most people would feel that way about knowing any details of their parents' sex life. That is *not* the same as their sex life being immoral.", "Yeah, she can blow up her life at 15 cause she decided she didn't like what her parents did in private. That's on her, she's still the asshole.", "Her physical well being isn't in any danger, neither is her mental. She's the only problem here. I don't want anything to do with children, stuck up wastes of space.", "You're right. It's just that this is reddit not real life", ">You have a responsibility as a parent not to be doing that stuff around your children.\n\nFrom what OP wrote, they have been doing a pretty great job of not doing that stuff around their children. It seem like they have been doing it for years, maybe more than a decade before OP found out and it was by accident.\n\nSeem like they 100% did their responsibility.", "I guess I just care how my kids feel and what they think of me. And I include that in my morals.", "She\u2019s not an asshole. She\u2019s just a kid. You\u2019re kind of a weird person tho lol", "I would rather hang out with a little kid over a weird redditor any day", "Thanks dude. I love real life.", "Guess we will agree to disagree.\n\nThanks for your time."]}
