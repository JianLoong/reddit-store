The mom of OP already sat grandma down and made the boundary, drew the line, and yet she still chose to go forward and cross it. I am guessing this may be the first time Op Has yelled at grams to this degree.  Maybe it not been the nicest for grandma to experience, but it\u2019s not as if she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to do that and at this point she has it coming. Maybe grandma\u2019s advancing age has something to do with it, but I find that unlikely but not impossible. If grandma has been doing this over the years prior to being told to stop, which she did for a few years, did she think she got a free pass since she has been so good?

He spat out at her \"you eat like that you are going to get fat!\". I was seeing red and I went off on him in front of the whole family something along the lines of \"what is it with you and everyone else's weight . . . \" I don't remember exactly how it continued but it was enough for the whole room to get silent and my grandpa to get embarrassed.  \n\nAfterwards I left to cool down and my mom followed me to yell at me. I said \"no! He has been making comments about my weight every time he sees me for years now.  I am strong and can ignore it or whatever but I sure as hell am not going to stand by while he gives my little cousins eating disorders with that crap!\".
