My mom has always been obsessed with weight (mine, hers, and anyone else\u2019s around her), and I finally laid it out how unhealthy and unhelpful that is. It\u2019s been (mostly) better ever since.

The older generation appears to believe they can say whatever they want to whoever they want.", "I would say NTA including having yelled at grandma. The mom of OP already sat grandma down and made the boundary, drew the line, and yet she still chose to go forward and cross it. I am guessing this may be the first time Op Has yelled at grams to this degree.  Maybe it not been the nicest for grandma to experience, but it\u2019s not as if she didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t supposed to do that and at this point she has it coming. Maybe grandma\u2019s advancing age has something to do with it, but I find that unlikely but not impossible. If grandma has been doing this over the years prior to being told to stop, which she did for a few years, did she think she got a free pass since she has been so good? Regardless, isn\u2019t this kind of consistent repetitive behavior that can fall into emotional abuse? Telling her granddaughter that type of stuff for years growing up and woman way or the other that she needs to lose weight because she\u2019s (to grandma) fat?", "Good grief. NTA! Your height and weight do NOT indicate even an ounce of extra weight. Your grandma in TA, though.", "No I don\u2019t feel like your the asshole. She crossed a boundary and that\u2019s not okay. Should you have yelled and said whatever things you said\u2026probably not but in the heat of the moment it\u2019s difficult to be rational. Older generations and some people who weren\u2019t taught better just don\u2019t understand the harm that words can do to a person.

She shouldn't have said it, but you should have responded with a controlled explanation of why it was hurtful and inappropriate or just walked away.\n\nYou are responsible for your yelling and the words you said.

Maybe just the way you worded it. My MiL called my autistic daughter fat to her face because she gained weight due to medications she needs to take. My daughter still gets teary eyed almost 20 years later. You are definitely not the AH for speaking up. You go girl!", "I might apologize for yelling, but not for the reaction in itself.

I wish my partner would do the same to her dad. He\u2019s always made comments about other people\u2019s weight - apart from people he feels he has no control over.
