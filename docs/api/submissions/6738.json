I won\u2019t get into details, but suffice it to say it was a shock and I\u2019m pretty bitter about it. \n\nI cared about this company. I was responsible for bringing in 10% of their current staff, including my daughter, who is still there and is a senior manager. \n\nA couple of weeks ago I got a text from my buddy (another one of the people I brought on board) inviting me to get some breakfast. We do this every few months. He said something about an ornament someone sent to me at work. I figured it was something one of my smaller clients made for me. Instead, it was a Waterford Crystal decorative ornament from one of my former company\u2019s vendors. \n\nI don\u2019t know why it was addressed to me. I\u2019m baffled as to why my former company even let me have it. I asked my buddy, and he shrugged and said no one wanted it. I really don\u2019t want it, either. \n\nI got home from breakfast and looked it up. Turns out, it\u2019s worth a little bit of money. I thought sweet, free money! I listed it for sale, and immediately got several offers. \n\nTo my surprise, my wife is super pissed. She thinks it\u2019s pretty (it is) and wants to keep it. She says she told me that before I listed it for sale, but all she told me is that she thought it was pretty. I probably should have known that she wanted it, though. \n\nI guess, in different circumstances, I\u2019d have said cool, it\u2019s yours. But not in these circumstances. I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t want it to be in my house.\n\nSet my feelings about my former company aside, if you\u2019d asked me prior to this whether I\u2019d rather have cash or a pretty trinket, I\u2019d have said cash.

But offer to get your wife something pretty that is Waterford crystal or something comprable that you will both enjoy.

She said it was pretty, not that she wanted it. Don't fall into this \"I probably should have known\" trap. You are not a mind reader and it's fair for you to sell an item that is yours, especially one that brings you unpleasant feelings.", "NTA - its your gift. You do what you want", "NTA.  She needs to communicate better/more directly.", "NAH but I'd think it's not worth getting rid of it makes your wife happy and if you all are in a situation where you'd never buy it for yourself. Is the cash you're going to get worth more than just doing something nice for your wife?", "NTA\n\nIt was given to you, and I can understand why you don\u2019t want it in your house given your history with your former company. \nPerhaps explain to your wife that it would serve as a constant reminder of your negative experience if this ornament stays with you.", "NTA.

It sounds like she saw it, said it was pretty and figured it was just part of the household now", "Is it already shipped? Can the sale be canceled? It sounds like you don't really need the $200 since you said it would likely end up being wasted, so let your wife have it or buy her something comparable. And by comparable, I don't mean $200. That's just what you could sell it for. Let her pick out something of comparable retail price. It would be a lot cheaper to just keep the pretty trinket.", "NTA, it's yours and was gifted to you, as such you can do with it as you please. If the circumstances were reversed people on here would be calling you controlling. Any influx of cash after a job loss is helpful.", "NTA. It\u2019s your ornament, not hers.", "INFO- did you tell your wife how much it bothers you to have it around as a painful reminder of the job you loved and lost?", "NAH. I see your side, you need the money. Wife has the right to be disappointed, but she didn't tell you in time.", "Well obviously it is reasonable for her to be upset because she liked the thing and she probably thought he was gonna ask her eventually if she wanted it instead of just selling it", "I\u2019ll probably take her to Hawaii soon. She can buy something there. We are not wealthy, so I think that\u2019s something.", "I feel the same way, but that trap is catching me big time. There\u2019s truth to it. I knew. I just didn\u2019t care.", "Yeah obviously, but the nice thing to do if you don't want a gift is to offer it to your wife first, unless you guys really need the money.", "100% agreed. I\u2019ve been trying to talk to her about communication, we both suck at it.", "It\u2019s only a couple hundred dollars", "She said we\u2019d just waste it. Of course we would, and she\u2019d usually be all for that.", "Ha! I like it.", "This is pretty much how I feel, but I care a lot more about her than I do the company.

I thought I was until this.", "The only justification I can see for selling something your wife wants is that you guy need the money, but saying that you going to take her to Hawaii makes me think that is not the case. Soft yta", "Even if you knew, your feelings matter here too. It wouldn't be fair to say that your wife \"probably should know\" that the ornament brought unpleasant feelings to you. But it did, and it would have continued to bring those feelings when you saw it. Consider explaining to your wife how you felt about it, not just what you thought. It's fine for her to feel disappointed, too. She really liked it. Consider acknowledging both your feelings and her feelings and seeing where it goes.", "Does an object that came from a vendor really bring bad feelings, I find that strange. Some basic communication with you spouse could of saved some headache, and yeah same goes for your spouse. But by your comment it seems you knew she wanted but just didn't care and I think that make YTA.", "It seems like you already have the item she would like to \"waste\" the money on so from her perspective why sell it. She could have a $200 item she loves or yall could piss away the $200 on smaller items or dinner. It seems like the bigger value is letting her enjoy the gift.", "Good advice", "And there lies my dilemma"]}
