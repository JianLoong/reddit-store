But it\u2019s not because you had knee surgery; it\u2019s that this is what you think renting out that space is worth, regardless of who it is.      \nSimilarly, your friend may decide that that rent is too high and look elsewhere.\n\nBUT; that\u2019s because what you\u2019re describing is a rental. If you were asking him specifically to stay with you to take care of you post surgery; that would not be you renting to him. That would be him staying with you as a favour, and you would be a jerk to ask for money on top of him already going out of his way to stay and help you when you need it.       \n\nYou describe expecting him to help with errands, which would be the second scenario. Is it possible that your friend thinks that you\u2019re actually asking for him to stay and help you - aka you\u2019re asking HIM for a favour - when you think you\u2019re talking about the first?", "NTA- anytime an agreement has terms like \u201coccasionally\u201d and \u201cthe groceries\u201d you\u2019re setting yourself up for another round of \u201cAITA for kicking my friend (57m) out of my house while I recover from knee surgery.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re not comfortable with it, it\u2019s not the right compromise.", "NTA he should make an actual finical contribution or get his own place if he\u2019s so well off.", "NTA; lol do not agree to this", "NTA but you need to set separate boundaries.  If you want him as a carer for you then yes you should pay him for that.  If you are offering him lodging then he should pay you.  Sounds like both of you have blurred lines here", "1. 1) there must be a written, legal document that he and you sign before he moves in that details everything: what you expect him to do as far as home health support (how many appointments does he need to drive you to, must he cook your food, drive you to the grocery store, clean, clean you, clean your laundry?), the literal dates he moves in and moves out, etc.\n2. 2) if he is **only** there to help you, he buys his own food, you buy your own. The rest is a wash because you won't be *paying for home healthcare* and, instead, relying on a friend to move in temporarily to 'help you'.\n3. If he thinks he's moving in as a temporary place to stay only, this is a no-go if your belief is that he's moving in to help you.\n4.

Why not explore other avenues?", "no, YWNBTA.\n\nhe can easily afford to do this, and frankly, dinner once in a while is not gonna cut it.  you need help for a few weeks, he wants to shack up at your place for several months?  sounds like he's running a scam on you.\n\ntell him rent and 6 weeks are not negotiable, and if he cannot accept those limitations then the arrangement will not suit your needs.  and for that 6 weeks he will need to do a lot more than buy a few meals or some groceries.\n\nand if he gets all bent out of shape over that, ain't life just awful.  that is a him problem, not a you problem.", "Info:  If he pays the $500 would you be ok if he doesn't help you around the house (outside of cleaning after himself)", "NTA. It's a very reasonable arrangement. Most people pay considerably more than that for an apartment that's very likely smaller than the areas of the house he'll have access to. Even with the running errands and helping out around the house it's a good deal for him. Especially since you would normally have to do that much just living on your own.", "Nta", "NTA\n\nDo not let him mooch off you.\n\nGood luck with your surgery!", "Nta", "NTA.

Don\u2019t feel the need to go easy in the finance department. He has the money and is trying to be a cheap ass with you. Get everything in writing is a good advice. Don\u2019t you ever watch any court shows and this is the majority of cases on are \u201cfriends\u201d helping friends and then getting ripped off big time.

If your friend breaks up and needs a place to stay for a couple months, you dont ask them to pay rent! They arent your friend if you do.

I'm asking because I'm wondering if you have a grasp of how much help you'll need. I've had my left knee majorly reworked 3 times, and knee surgeries run the gamut from \"up and walking in a day or two\" to \"absolutely no weight bearing and lots and lots of pain for weeks\". Which will yours be? \n\nIf your friend truly doesn't have to care for you after surgery, and it's just an extra few trips to the store, then wanting a set amount makes total sense. But, if he needs to help you get up, help you around the house, and otherwise care for you after surgery then that should be taken into account, too.\n\nMaybe you can agree to less per month ($350?? $400??) and  extra help after surgery, should you need it?\n\nGood luck, I hope your surgery is a success and any discomfort is well managed.", "NTA: $500 a month is a better deal than he will find anywhere else, and he seemingly can easily afford it.  \n\nPersonally I\u2019d insist on paying my friends because it would feel awkward not to.", "NTA, he asked to stay with you and your entitled to rent. It's best to not consider any groceries, etc. that he may help you with as part of it. I live alone and have had two surgeries. The one good thing now is that you can get just about anything delivered from groceries to things you might want from Walmart or Target. (I spilled something on my keyboard during the pandemic and was thrilled to be able to get a cheap one delivered from Walmart, along with groceries, the same day. Except for help getting to places like re-hab you'll be able to do just about everything. If you can be very independent, that justifies charging rent. But if you want your friend to do a lot of things for you, then yeah, you should probably figure it's a toss up of both of you helping the other.", "NTA. It's great for your friend that he is somewhat footloose and fancy free, but you are not in that position.\n        \nI'm also not clear on why a 57 year-old man who has a good financial situation and no girlfriend needs a break on rent. I don't know where you live, but $500/month + utilities for his own room, bathroom, and a place to park sounds like a bargain.", "NAH -- I think you both need to have a clear discussion about what you both need and expect out of this arrangement. \n\nAnother commentor said this, but: do you realize you need your knees for, like, everything basically? You've mentioned other friends have offered to do grocery runs, but is your friend living with you going to be expected to cook and bring your food to you, then clean the kitchen and do the dishes every day? Is he going to be expected to do all the cleaning around the house and the laundry for you both? Etc, etc, etc? \n\nYou're going to need a lot more help than him running errands outside the house for you (which is still a lot if he's going to be in charge of all/most of them). If you don't have someone else to handle those things, and you're going to rely on this friend for that during your recovery, I wouldn't charge a dime. If it is truly just the odd errand here and there, then rent would be reasonable. \n\nPerhaps this is what he was thinking when he made that offer? This is why I say NAH -- I don't think either of you are trying to be A-holes, but a clear plan must be agreed upon.", "Do not allow this. This guy will never move out.", "Not only should you charge rent if you like, more importantly, you should have a written agreement about the terms, including a specific procedure for what happens when you want him out (e.g., 30 days notice). Look up your local renting laws to make sure that you have complete control over that. Anyone with plenty of money who wants to stay at a friend's home in exchange for buying groceries might not be looking to leave any time soon.\n\nNTA.", "NAH... but if he is renting - he has no obligations to be nurse, cook, driver, cleaner...\nSo choose wisely", "You make a good point. Just to clarify: I wasn't really looking for a roommate. My friend asked if he could stay b/c he'd been living with his girlfriend and needs to move out. BECAUSE I'm having surgery, I'm more amenable to this than I might be otherwise. He offered to run errands, but lots of friends have made that offer--I see that as something friends do for each other, not something in exchange for rent, especially from someone who is quite wealthy. I want a more business-like arrangement so as NOT to blur the lines. Otherwise, it feels as if each time he contributes, he's doing me a favor, not paying his share.", "100%. He sounds cheap so part of the AITA would definitely be something like, \"He does technically buy some groceries but only a half gallon of milk, four eggs and three pieces of lettuce every other week.\" It's just an invitation for headaches.", "1. 1.\n2. 2)", "This!", "nah, she is needing help around the house, and help with bills while she physically recovers from surgery.  if he is unwilling to do that and is looking to hang out rent-free for a few months, that sounds more like a scam than any kind of friend.\n\nat this point I'm thinking his breakup was cos he was cheating and so his former SO has the house they were sharing.  that's how he sounds.  OP needs help, physical and financial, and \"friend\" is unwilling even though he could pay that out of pocket money.  OP WNBTA in any way here.", "Stick to your guns - $500 a month is a steal nearly everywhere and you\u2019re doing your friend a favor. You\u2019re absolutely correct that you can\u2019t budget around vague assurances.", "Also get a written rental agreement to protect yourself."]}
