He thinks I should stay, and says he may come back after he works on himself but the apartment is too big and expensive for just me and was supposed to be where we started a family and got married.\n\nDue to having to pay for the miscarriage procedure out of pocket(he didn\u2019t pay any portion) and Christmas presents, I can\u2019t handle all the rent on my own. He agreed to pay the majority for the next two months, but his mom (57f) is saying it\u2019s not fair because he doesn\u2019t live here anymore and instead thinks he should just tell the landlord he\u2019s moving out and disregard me. All his furniture and belongings are here and he hasn\u2019t gotten a new place and he stays over 2 nights a week. She also discouraged therapy for us. I suspect she is a big reason for him ending things as it was really out of the blue and not like him to leave when things get tough and also doesn\u2019t really seem like what he really wants. It\u2019s strange to me because they both really liked me and called me part of the family and I\u2019m not sure how a miscarriage could trigger such emotions as opposed to empathy/support for me. I\u2019m guessing his mom never liked me but pretended to for some reason and the thought of us being stuck together by a child freaked her out so when I had a miscarriage she decided to reveal how she really felt to him? They are very close and he has a lot of childhood trauma from her always yelling at him and making him do whatever she says. She blocked me so I am not able to ask her what is going on, we previously had a great relationship and talked weekly. All his clothes and furniture are still here and he has no plans of taking it out so I have no clue what is actually happening between us. I don\u2019t plan on renewing the lease, but I\u2019d like our deposit back as it\u2019s 4,000$.\n\nIn my opinion it is not fair for him to just up and leave during this difficult time and should definitely pay part of the rent until I can find a roommate/find a roommate to replace him, is that wrong?", "created_utc": 1703567661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r0jrg/aita_for_expecting_my_25fbf_29mto_keep_paying/", "score": 78, "replies": ["#This is now a Proctologists Only Orifice\r\n\r\nWhen a post is in [POO\u2122 mode](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/168bzq8/title_aita_monthly_open_forum_september_2023) only users with enough subreddit comment karma are able to comment.

He's a loser and you deserve better.", "He is on the lease, which means he is as responsible for the rent as you are.

I don't know if you have family around and just need someone to tell you its going to be ok but in the end it will be. \n\nYour boyfriend needs to be your ex in my opinion. While you are dealing with the loss of a child he runs. That is not a man you need in your life. He is making sure that he can get an escape from his mom with you but not commit to you. Going through therapy is great for you two but only if he is committed to the process and half in and half out is not it. \n\nYou might want to go and speak to the landlord and see what you can do. Tell boyfriend that his things staying there is not what you need and if he wants to do so than he needs to pay for half the rent. Then look for a roommate. Talk to your family or those that you consider family and see if they can help you out with rent assistance or a family/friend move in with you. \n\nTake a breath to heal and once again I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. \n\nWhile there is typically a way to break the lease, it usually incurs a pretty steep \u201cfine\u201d to where it is less of a hassle to just finish paying out the duration as most leases are annual anyways.\n\nI\u2019d be hesitant to get back with this guy if he\u2019s already itching to move out during this type of event in your lives. Does kind of read like his mom is babying him and likely trying to convince him to move on. \n\nSorry that happened.", "NTA\n\nMy ex and I had a baby and he left me there in the apartment alone till I moved home 8 months later. His mother was kind and paid his portion of rent and utilities but also helped me move because she knows as well as anyone it takes 2. I am so sorry that you lost your baby so suddenly and had to go through all of that and he should have been supportive of you during that time. I am thinking he may be under duress by his mother and your intuitions may be correct. Talk to the therapist about it without bringing up accusations against his mother and see what he says in response.", "NTA. Lease is a contract,  he's on the hook until the lease is up.", "NTA.   \nWhile his stuff is there\u2026 he should pay rent. \n\nAnd then when he takes his stuff\u2026 the lease still applies. He signed a contract, and should see it through. Consider having him sign something giving you the deposit (if it\u2019s in his name) and in return he takes his stuff and goes out now. If you can pack it all into boxes (nicely, because) and have him come and get it. Tell him you are moving out because you can\u2019t afford it, and that the move out date is X and he needs to get his stuff by then, or you will stop paying rent and make that a him problem.   \nI\u2019m glad you guys are over.", "NTA and I'd make him an ex boyfriend. \n\nYou were going to have a child together and had a miscarriage and he broke up with you and moved out. Now he's also wanting off the lease even though he's still spending nights there. This is not a person who wants to build a future with you.

Make sure to ask for it every month. If you want to and your lease allows for it you could offer an olive branch that you will accept a subletter if he can find one. If he does this I\u2019d make sure he does all the legwork for it. \n\nIf he refuses to pay the rent outstanding, then you can take him to small claims for the balance he owes. You will be able to sue for half of whatever you paid.\n\nIt seems like you think that your ex is owed some sympathy or benefit of the doubt here. He is about as scummy as you can get."]}
