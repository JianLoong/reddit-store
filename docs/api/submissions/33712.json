There are way too many variables to weigh in on AITA: I'd advise you to reach out to your social support system for recommendations. Contracts are intentionally difficult to change the terms of once signed, but he also has options he can pursue, because his mother is right: a reasonable person who isn't living at an apartment anymore should try to get out of a lease contract there, and I personally have yet to come across a time I needed to move before my lease end date and failed to do so in some form or fashion.
