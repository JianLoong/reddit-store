OP says \u201cI can\u2019t have my mother around my clients\u201d\u2026. which leads me to believe she may have dementia.  Perhaps the parents need more help than they\u2019re able or willing to give. If so, it\u2019s still understandable why OP doesn\u2019t want them in the house\u2026 but be honest. Additionally, if they do need professional assistance, maybe OP can help them find the help they need. Not pay for it\u2026 just find it.

The ESH comes from the fact there's been no communication between you and your parents about this at all. Time to sit down with them and lay out all the expectations on the table. What do they need or expect from you? Are you their primary caregiver now? Can they cook or clean for themselves or is the expectation that you provide for them? Can they contact you quickly and easily in an emergency - they likely felt safer knowing you would be in the house, but now they're separated. And then you also need to set boundaries with them around your work time and downtime, access to the main house, personal space, so you don't get burnt out.\n\nI think a huge conversation has been completely skipped over here, but it's really important you have it asap. Being a caregiver to ageing parents is incredibly taxing emotionally, physically and financially. Have you discussed things like medical bills and paying for an in-home carer, etc. when their health deteriorates? Do they have money put aside for that or is the expectation that you will be responsible for it? Do you have siblings who can also contribute care if needed? Do they have a will, and will it be an equal split between siblings, or will there be provisions in there seeing as you are contributing more by having them live with you?

My parents are adults and can deal with having a free home where we're not up in each other's living space all the time. \n\nAnyway this kinda actually happened with my in laws. They come off as really normal people. Very middle of the road and milquetoast and nothing stands out usually. Turns out MiL is into some WooWoo stuff but she never talks about it because she knows it weirds other people out. So 2 things happened that made me tell them they had to stay downstairs and I locked the door between units. #1 I was sleeping in my bed with my husband and was awoken by my fucking MiL kissing me on the cheek in the morning to wake me up for no reason. Never imagined I'd have to lock my fucking bedroom door instead of just shutting it. We told her not to come in again and locked the door and I woke up the next day to her trying to rattle it open. jfc.  #2 I had several rescue animals that would often be in the main living space, some are very small, like a bird and a little rescue dog that vacuumed up everything. So I told the in-laws that any pills and meds they had HAD to stay in their bedroom or bathroom and why. Under no circumstance could they be taken in the kitchen or main area. Found a fucking pill on the kitchen floor. Asked what it was \"oh that's just the strychnine I take, it's too small to hurt anything\" ... okay so I personally feel homeopathy is BS and there probably was nothing resembling strychnine in it, but if there was? My bird weighed a few ounces and my MiL weighed like 180lbs. Something isn't going to affect both the same way. And that is one of the most torturous ways to die.
