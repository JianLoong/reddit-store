She knows him well considering how long they have been married. \n\nHe also makes her favourite breakfast on a regular basis. \n\nSo regardless of WHY he has a favourite spoon, he has one and she should be considerate enough to use it.", "as a fellow Small Cutlery Autistic I can recommend children's cutlery sets!", "they've been together for over three years. that's why he feels unloved - because they've been together a long time and she hasn't even noticed how important this is to him.", "Hubby doesn\u2019t need to \u201cwork through\u201d anything. They\u2019ve been married for years. They\u2019ve done this tradition for *years*. And OP know how important the spoon is to him. I think it\u2019s fair for him to feel the way he does when even OP points out the major difference in effort between the two. OP can\u2019t even try to make actual breakfast on their days when hubby goes above and beyond, and OP can\u2019t wash a measly spoon?", "Oh fr? I didn't know that, and I'm surprised that OP has omitted that important info.", "I didn't know that he's autistic, hence why I said that in my original comment.", "I already said that I didn't know he's autistic when I first made that comment", "Ahh ok.  Thanks", "You clearly don\u2019t understand autism at all. If Im already feeling a bit stressed or upset, my food and crockery related sensory issues are enough to send me into a meltdown where I\u2019ll cry or hurt myself from being so overwhelmed. How is he meant to adapt to that exactly? Removing himself from the situation was a really great way to navigate that distress, so at least he\u2019s trying to deal with it. Can\u2019t say the same for her.", "op admits it in a different comment. it\u2019s in her reply to the top comment iirc.", "OP has mentioned it in their comments a few times", "OP mentions it in one of her replies.", "Why didn\u2019t you just pull the spoon he likes out of the dishwasher before running it and wash it by hand? With all the effort he puts into breakfast, if you\u2019re only making coffee taking thirty seconds to wash one spoon seems pretty minor for you", "He can wash the spoon too. This was a one time thing. Not every day. But I shouldn\u2019t be surprised because this sub seems to excuse any behavior if the person has autism. If he didn\u2019t have autism, people would be telling OP \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 abuse!!!", "Laundry is a pretty big ask that is for him.", "How is laundry not for him?", "You just tossed me into a thought spiral with that one question.\n\nOP in case you read this, I recently found out that so many in my home, 5 people, have a penchant for \"the good spoons\". They are from a silverware set I purchased over twenty years ago as a single person. It took me some time and enough money, but now every spoon is a \"good spoon\".", "It's just about taking care of your partner. They come home and all of their clothes are nice clean and put away. You learn how they like their underwear folded and which socks they like air dried. Which outfit is their favorite to go to the gym in so you make sure to wash that one if it's a small load. It's not romantic per say but makes someone feel cared about and loved.", "Yes but it is for him bc if age does it then he doesn\u2019t have to do the gross thing", "Unlike cooking?", "As another autistic person, I think it does matter why he likes that spoon. For other people, liking a spoon is just liking a spoon. Maybe they\u2019re a bit annoyed but they can handle the change okay because they don\u2019t have a literal disability in managing unexpected change. OP\u2019s husband does. It\u2019s like the difference between *preferring* that the towels are placed lower down, and *needing* the towels placed lower down because you use a wheelchair. One is preference, the other comes into disability accommodation and may be far less negotiable.\n\nHim being autistic means it\u2019s even more important she got this detail right and even more damning on her that she didn\u2019t, despite knowing it\u2019s important and why.", "I think we\u2019re basically agreeing that she\u2019s the asshole here, either for not knowing (unlikely) or not caring that he needs that spoon. I\u2019m just less sure that he cares about her not making breakfast vs him making it. For all we know, that might be an integral part of the routine \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "He's autistic and also prefers little spoons, so it would never be an issue for us. Lol \n\nNo one else in my family knows or realizes that about either of us", ">Right, and your family know this? \n\nI am not diagnosed neurodivergent but wouldn't be surprised if I am and I definitely have silverware preferences. I haven't lived at home in 10 years but every time I visit my mom still says \"is this fork okay?\"", "You could have hand washed a single spoon.", "Yeah man I agree, I'm just saying that OP wasn't \"blaming is autism\"", "your edit hadn\u2019t loaded when i commented", "and if the genders were reversed, y\u2019all would be screaming at op for weaponized incompetence and saying that their partner deserved someone who puts in effort. but bc op is a woman, it\u2019s fine if she\u2019s so lazy in the kitchen that she just makes coffee on her breakfast days and still leaves him to make his own damn food. (while he makes her favorite breakfast food on his days) \n\nalso, excusing *what* behavior? him leaving the room and removing himself from the situation bc he was upset? op *herself* said that he didn\u2019t take it out on her and instead went upstairs. he didn\u2019t throw the coffee in her face, he went upstairs to be alone bc he was upset and didn\u2019t want to lash out.", "Ah, yes, lugging a basket of clothes down to the river,  washing them with homemade soap, scrubbing them in the cold water, dragging the wet heavy load back to your house, hanging it on the rope between the apple tree and the pear tree, praying it doesn't rain before the clothes can dry.", "Unless he has super-finicky clothes, laundry doesn't require much thought or effort.", "Exactly. Why is making food more romantic than doing laundry? On the other hand, I'd have to agree that having food made for you FEELS like a  more romantic gesture when you're on the receiving end. Hmm..I wonder why that is? Maybe it's the immediate satisfaction that appeals to your senses...Now I'm just rambling, but it got me thinking", "It's not really that he's just cooking, it's that he takes the time and notice to make her favorite breakfast every morning, she knows how much he likes this particular spoon (in a comment she says he has autism, so it may even be a sensory thing), and despite the thought he puts into her preferences every morning, she doesn't put in the same thought for his preferences.", "Yeah, cooking is def the chore that I most hate doing!!!", "Right?", "I feel like her even mentioning is was kind of saying \u201cmaybe he\u2019s only sensitive about this because he\u2019s ND\u201d\n\nNo. He\u2019s sensitive because OP doesn\u2019t consider him the way he considers her.", "I absolutely would not. She forgot to turn on the dishwasher. It wasn\u2019t on purpose. There were other spoons available for him to use that would\u2019ve worked just as well. That\u2019s the issue for me.", "this isn\u2019t just about the dishwasher this one time, that\u2019s what you\u2019re ignoring. this is about op *repeatedly* and *constantly* putting in minimum effort.", "He chooses to do more than her. He is not complaining about that. He is only complaining about the spoon. That is the conflict we have been asked to judge.", "the spoon is indicative of the larger problem of op\u2019s lack of consideration. it would\u2019ve taken op less than thirty seconds to pull the spoon out and hand wash it. thirty seconds that obviously would\u2019ve meant a lot to her husband. but she didn\u2019t do it bc she\u2019s lazy, even though she *knew* that his safe spoon was an important part of this morning ritual. it would\u2019ve been a very simple and easy thing to do, but she chose not to because *she doesn\u2019t care enough.* that\u2019s the problem."]}
