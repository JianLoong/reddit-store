In the past, my boss had blown up my cell-phone and Teams when I was away sick or at an approved appointment because an issue occurred.

I don't think they need me to advise and offer solutions but supposedly no one else in the company can. \n\nWhen I returned to work yesterday, I opened my Teams to a great deal of missed messages and some deleted messages from my boss. My boss immediately called a team meeting to criticize me and told me that I abandoned my duty during an emergency. That I let my team down who had to work over-time and I show no care for my work.
