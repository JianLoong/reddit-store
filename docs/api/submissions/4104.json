That really doesn\u2019t sound legal to me! In which country are you, OP? \n\nThat unpaid extra time also, is just too much! Why don\u2019t you talk to a recruiter and see what options you have? \n\nDefinitely NTA!", "Block her number and everyone\u2019s number in the office until you return. Then say oh your calls didn\u2019t go through.", "NTA. Your boss is horrible. Unprofessional, vindictive, immature, and not even good at doing the job itself. Why have you stayed there for so long? Genuine question, not criticism.", "Assuming you are in the US, it is illegal for your boss to force you to work if you are on PTO. Hence, the O in PTO. It doesn't matter if you had a staycation and had access to your computer. You should not be asked to work and, in fact, could get yourself in trouble if you do. Your boss sounds like a terrible manager and will be a major contributing factor to your burn out if you don't put a stop to this immediately. I work in HR and would be furious to hear what this manager is doing. You are most definitely NTA. Time to set your very reasonable boundary about not being contacted or expected to work during PTO and stick to it. If she doesn't like it and refuses to resct that, tell her it may be time to schedule a sit down with HR to mediate.", "NTA. You need a new job. Your boss is an utterly awful person. If I was you I would put in a formal complaint about them.", "\"I'm sorry, paid time OFF  is a benefit and part of my compensation package. If you'd like me to be on call outside of my employment contract my on call vacation rate is [4x regular rate]\"\n\nAlso nta, the whole company you work for is", "NTA - You need to find a new job ASAP. You don\u2019t publicly humiliate put one of your best workers the day after they get back from vacation. You need to be a manager, since your own manager cannot survive a week without you.", "Are you VP level making a 6 figure salary? No. You're nta. People like your boss are the worst. I would say check with your HR about this intimidation and harassment to work on your paid time off.\n\nTired of this hustle culture shit. You earned your time off and it does not matter if you want to spend the whole week sitting in your couch at home or in a vineyard in France sipping wine, the same rules apply. Paid. Time. Off\nAgain you're NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou are not a VP and are not compensated as one. \nYour boss is incompetent.", "If this happened in a country with better employee rights, you could actually sue them. Like it's paid vacation time. To have a break. From work. it's not work remotely.   \nI'm in a country where we don't really have that much better employee rights but the company I work with is a global one that cares about the stuff. So like if someone's away we never contact them. They should have a proxy for emergencies anyway.   \n\n\nNTA", "Your boss should not have the power to manipulate your emotions. Your leave is part of your compensation, so if you don\u2019t take your vacations, your boss is stealing money from you. Don\u2019t let them.", "Are you located in the US? You mention having a contact--are you a 1099 employee?", "This place sounds like a walking DOL violation. Stop working on PTO days. Let it be known you are turning your phone off when on PTO.", "Only if she's hourly. If she's salaried she's SOL.", "Tell her that you are willing to work, but while you're on vacation you are acting as a contractor and will be charging contractor rates of $100 an hour.", "That\u2019s bullshit. She probably tells everyone the same thing, but it\u2019s not true.  You can tell your boss no.  \n\nIf you do work during your vacation, put in overtime. My job isn\u2019t \u201cnormal,\u201d and I\u2019m actually on call all the time.  I took a mini-vacation for my birthday and ended up working an hour during my time off. I sure as hell put in for overtime.", "Most jobs in the US don\u2019t have contracts."]}
