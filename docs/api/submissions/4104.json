NEVER give any info about your vacations. Make it clear you will not be available, and if asked always say \"I'm uncomfortable discussing my private life at work\" when asked. It sounds cold, but too many jobs will take a mile if you give an inch. If you give no info, you will never be accused of lying if you do something  like a stay cation. Personal life info should be on a \"need to know\" basis if it will affect work. Keep things vague and outline expectations ahead of time.", "NTA. Document and report to HR. Not because you expect HR to do anything but to have documentation that they were notified to CYA in case further action is needed. You were on vacation! Tired of this mentality in the USA of trying to get people to work on their vacation days. It's total crap.", ">  My boss immediately called a team meeting to criticize me and told me that I abandoned my duty during an emergency.   \n    \nNTA, HR immediately, let HR know that your boss is not just punishing you for taking your scheduled PTO, but that they are calling meetings to publicly humiliate you for it.    \n    \nYou were on vacation, you were not on call, those are very different things, with very different expectations and pay.  If you were on call, you should be paid to be on call, and your vacation balance remains untouched.", "NTA, and you are not a VP if you are in an entry-level position.", "NTA. And find a new job, ASAP. This kind of management is just going to continue grinding you down, until you are nothing more than a mindless drone. Your \"boss\" likely has no idea how to do the daily job, let alone how to handle emergencies(if it even was one). And the fact that your team couldn't be arsed to figure it out speaks volumes to his other deficiencies. If you are a SPOF(Single Point of Failure), then your boss is not properly training and documenting responsibilities. And, unless specifically assigned, it is not your responsibility.\n\nHell, I'd even go to HR and file a hostile work environment claim regarding the meeting and its topics. Screen cap any messages and save to a word doc that you make multiple copies of.", "If you know this is the US, then why would you suggest to document this? Like, why would HR give a shit about this?

It doesn't really define on-call. We don't have an HR anymore since they quit.", "Corporate America may not care but Labor Boards sure do. If you are being forced to work unpaid overtime, report it to your state. They love fining the business and making them pay up.", "HR folks are the ones who ensure the company stays compliant with labor laws and regulations. They often have a perspective that day to day managers do not. \n\nEven if HR does nothing, that\u2019s usually an important step to take before OP kicks it higher up the chain to a governmental agency, as another poster mentioned. \n\nDefinitely document, document, document. I didn\u2019t document properly when an employer robbed me of vacation time and now they\u2019re free to do it again.", "My HR would eat my bosses lunch for this. It really does depend on the company culture.", "Just say you'll be gone, doesn't matter where, you don't have to tell her.", "Yep. To see if you have cell service and therefore work access.", "As long as your in the job, every vacation is now camping/hiking/cruise where there's no cell service, no matter what you're really doing.", "If it\u2019s entry-level, you can probably get a different job elsewhere. I\u2019d start looking.", "At entry level, it has to be hourly.", "Does it define vacation? Or your current role's attendance policies? I am NAL, but I've often found reading through crappy bureaucratic company policy can help.", "OP the entire HR team quit? This is a very bad sign in regards to a company especially if they are so ambiguous about policies. It sounds like a toxic work place. It could also be an indication the company is failing since they haven't replaced the HR team(this is dependent on the length of time since the HR has been gone.)", "OP talked about VPs, this is very much a white collar corporate America job. And in white collar corporate America, there's no such thing as paid overtime.", "I have worked almost 20 years in corporate America, in companies with over 250k employees and down to 10 employees. There's absolutely nothing to document here. Everyone at every company will work on evenings, on their PTO, and sick days. Heck, there's a guy who claimed to have worked while his wife is in labor. \n\nLook up the definition of salaried employees before giving nonsensical advice.", "Yes, it's totally a culture thing. And we saw the last comment where it says all the VPs work a few hours each day during their vacation. So, what's to document in this case?", "She is so great and very funny.", "You're incorrect in this. Your PTO and Vacation time are considered sacred to the Department of Labor. It's technically the only time off in a salaried position - and violating it can have dire consequences if you get caught.", "The hell there isn't! If YOU choose to work for free, that's your business, but it's still illegal.", "If they are working for a company that doesn\u2019t allow them to take PTO then they should find a new company.", "There\u2019s \u201cexempt\u201d and \u201cnon-exempt\u201d salaried positions. \u201cNon-exempt\u201d gets paid OT.", "Other countries don\u2019t have vp\u2019s????

Love to learn if I'm wrong here.", "In the US that depends... on if you are salaried, hourly or that abomination they call \"salaried hourly\".", ">but it's still illegal\n\nSeriously, just because you don't like it and it's morally incorrect doesn't make it illegal.", "Well, that's always the solution, isn't it? The whole point of this particular chain is that there's nothing to document. Corporate American runs on unpaid overtime.", "You don't even know what VP signifies here, do you? Lol", "I wouldn't worry too much about them, they've spent their life in shitty jobs and want the rest of the world to be as miserable as they are.", "What's your point? Find the right hr manager and follow him or her to companies? I'm sure this strategy might work, but probably impractical for most?", "Haven't you heard? You're supposed to act like you're manager until you're the manager! How else you think corporate America got away with this bs for years?", "I'm on mobile and I don't want to get into the difficult-to-search FLSA, but it's in there.", "True, there are a LOT of laws I don't like. They remain laws. Same goes in reverse, just because you want to work unpaid doesn't erase labor laws. \n\nFolks like you are WHY there are labor laws! Let's be honest, if companies could make people work for free, no one would EVER get paid!", "There's actually laws regulating overtime for a lot of salaried positions. You'd be surprised how many companies legally run afoul of these laws.", "They cannot force you or penalize you for taking paid time off and not responding. I'm not sure where you get your information from. This has nothing to do with overtime or being salaried.", "Because we let it.", "Yes I do. Just didn\u2019t know Vice Presidents were strictly an American thing. I\u2019m in Canada and thought I knew people who were vp\u2019s but I guess not.", "My thought as well.", "What\u2019s yours? Just suck it up and fuck work life balance? That sounds miserable and sets up knarly expectations.\n\nWhen I was young in my field (systems/network administration) I didn\u2019t stand up for myself and eventually got ground into the dirt for no reward.\n\nIt took learning the power of \u201cno\u201d before I fixed my work life balance and my \u201cactually getting paid well\u201d situation.\n\nI could go into how respecting your own time and telling others no when they need to hear it not only increases your value, but the confidence you build in having your own back also increases your capability but you\u2019d probably handwave it off.\n\nBrowbeat teams are not competent teams. If you don\u2019t have time to take off it also means that ingestion rate for new ideas/tech etc is also on the back burner due to living in firefighting mode. The first step in fixing a department like this is someone finally having the balls to say \u201cno\u201d. If they are so invaluable that they get lit up any time they take a day off then they have power and should use it.", "I've been in corporate America long enough to know bs when I see it. And you, sir or madam, definitely belong in corporate America.", "If you are a salaried employee then there is nothing illegal about your company making you work more than 40 hours per week. However IME HR and upper management will still care quite a bit about someone who manages entry level employees demanding work during a vacation.", "People like me? Who quit my job cause I'm sick of politics in corporate America? \n\nJust cause someone's telling you facts don't make them your enemy. Unlike you're incapable of handling facts. \n\nI don't know why you keep talking about labor laws. Look up the definition of salaried employees. There's not a single labor law that will protect salaried employees from unpaid overtime.", "You're the second one telling me there's law regulatoling this.  I've been in corporate America for almost 20 years, with companies 250k employees or 10 employees. Instead of keep telling me there's such a law... how about the actual law or case on this?", ">They cannot force you or penalize you for taking paid time off and not responding\n\ncan you give the labor law or case where company cannot fire you or give you a bad review for not responding to an emergency during your vacation or PTO?", "Oh, I'm totally ready for Gen Z to bring down the house. We need laws like Europe where it's illegal to text or email workers after work hours. \n\nBut our young don't vote, do they? All they do is tik tok, complain, and even go to a protest or two. But no, they can't vote. So, we're where we are.", "I think you've taken one comment out of context. Many American companies are international, of course there's VPs in other countries. I was simply using the term VP to deduct that OP works in a corporate environment, cause blue collars don't talk about VPs.", "You do realize the only point I've made here is that there's nothing to document, cause no law was broken and hr don't give a shit? \n\nDude, I worked myself into carpal tunnel and launched defect free projects, only to get smaller bonus and fucked over for promotions. What makes you think I'm on the employer's side when all I said was it's pointless to document?!?", "Entry position... Only you are claiming it's salary & even then you cannot be forced to work ON VACATION!\n\nI'm bringing up labor laws because they exist to protect employees from bosses that would happily abuse employees like OP.", "It may not be illegal to text or email during off hours, but I broke a supervisor from doing this.  I started letting my 8 year old answer it and told her to always hit the video call button. Always.  And then, tell him ALL about her day while she pretends to look for me.  I'm usually in the same room trying not to laugh out loud.  Apparently hearing all the words to literally Amy possible song choice changed to poop isn't fun after the third time. Who knew?", "So... you think there's no such thing as  entry level salaried positions?!? What? Have you not heard of bankers fresh out of college and pulling 80+ hours weeks? \n\nNo one is forcing OP. OP didn't bother working the entire week. But he better get a new job. Cause that's how corporate America works. Either get out or go with it. No HR nor LABOR LAW will \"protect employees from bosses that would ask [salaried employees to work during vacation]\".  \n\nPlease learn the law before you keep quoting it.  It completely makes no sense here.", "Omg... you're amazing! Love it!"]}
