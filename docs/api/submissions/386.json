Just because she enjoyed being outside doesn\u2019t mean you have to. Sounds like you live with the parent who respects you. I understand her desire to bond with you but she needs to find another way", "NTA - if your not comfortable don\u2019t force yourself. I also will not go outside once the mosquitoes come out. I get your mom is trying to connect (although complaining to your dad is off\u2026) but maybe ask if you guys can do a board game night in?", "NTA \n\nI understand where you are coming from. I get bit very often. It\u2019s very uncomfortable. \n\nI get that your mom is trying to bond with you and your siblings so she is trying. (It wasn\u2019t okay for her to call your dad and whine about this\u2026 she could have talked to you). \n\nThat said, if you still wanted to give it a go again: Can you get mosquito repellent? A blanket? \nOr just limit your time there (I will come out for a bit and stay 30 mins)? Bring your blanket, sheet or repellent etc. This way you made an effort. \n\nHowever, mom should also try to meet you halfway. You can talk to her about compromising.\n\nDo the family like bonding in another way? Family movie and popcorn night? Story and joke time? Family afternoon stroll or getting ice cream? \n\nGood luck OP! Glad your dad had your back and I hope you and mom can find some common ground.", "NTA. Your mom needs to figure out ways to spend time with you on your terms, with activities that you enjoy.", "NTA. You are your own individual person, not a reflection or an extension of your mother. Good for you, having your father's support. And just a couple of years, before you are done being forced to visit her for good.", "Nta. Your dad gave the correct answer. You are your own person, with your own preferences.  And your mom needs to respect that and meet you were you are comfortable. Otherwise, she's not really getting to know YOU. She's trying to mold you into her IDEA OF you that she has in her head. Of who she thinks you should be.  And that isn't going to work. You have the right to be yourself. You can't be anyone else. And if your mother isn't willing to accept that and throws away the chance at a relationship with you because of that, well....then that means there is something wrong with her, not you.\n\nYou deserve unconditional love. Every child does. I'm sorry that your mother has forgotten that. I may be an internet stranger, but I'm willing to send you all the extra love in my heart. I can't have my own kids like I want to, so I have plenty to spare after giving lots to my niblings, and it grows back with abundance everyday. And your dad sounds awesome. Lean on him, and love him fiercely, the way he does you.", "ESH. She sucks for favoritism. And technically you have the right to go inside and she shouldn't bug you too much about it. On the other hand, there's a part of me that thinks that you should kind of just suck it up. You only get to see her once a year, she wants to spend time together as a family and everyone is hanging out by a bonfire. It's hard to like someone who can't have fun just doing stuff that's normally fun for everybody else. Like you should at least try to get over your feelings about being outside in the dark. A lot of adult life takes place outside in the dark. So I would work on your courage. Bugs aren't usually a huge problem because smoke will repel them and you can always add layers. Nothing is watching you in the dark. Like.... It seems like you're being a little difficult. That said, if she really cares that much then she can go inside and hang out with you. So it's just like nobody is willing to compromise here when everyone should be willing to compromise. Why didn't you just put on extra layers of clothing?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She needs to learn your kids are not a carbon copy of yourself. You don\u2019t get to dictate what they like. I guess you get some quiet evenings.
