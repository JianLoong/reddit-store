I\u2019m in my 30s and everyone involved are between 30-50. \n\nAbout 6 months ago, our unit VP announced his retirement by the end of the year so the company went into search mode. We recently found out our manager will be promoted into the VP position so now his position needs to be filled. Which brings us to my current situation.\n\nI\u2019m single with no kids so I have no other responsibilities except to myself. I really want this position because it\u2019s a visible position and a great stepping stone to my career (as seen by my manager\u2019s promotion) and it\u2019ll almost double my pay. Once we found out about our manager\u2019s promotion, I started to take on extra projects and taking work home. I leave work at my normal hours then work from home until 9 or 10 pm, even on the weekends. All of those extra hours have allowed me to take on harder projects that other people turned down and complete more than anyone else. My manager and the VP have noticed and complimented me on my hustle. My colleagues also noticed my increased production. Last week a work friend asked me how I\u2019m able to do all of those projects in 8 hrs and I told her about my nights and weekends. \n\nWord got around and this week during our weekly conference call, my colleagues told me to cut it out. They accused me of cheating because I\u2019m putting in the amount of hours they can\u2019t so I\u2019m skewing the production numbers. I refused and don\u2019t think it\u2019s cheating at all and argued they can put in the same amount of hours. Some said they can\u2019t because of family time and others refuse to work hours they won\u2019t get paid for (we\u2019re all on salary). We spent most of the meeting arguing about it.\n\nAm I cheating? AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t add it to the post because of character limits. My colleagues and I are all supervisors. I have a mentor who\u2019s a VP in a different unit and he\u2019s advising me on the promotion process and steps I need to take. He also told me what to expect if I get promoted so I\u2019m going into this fully informed. Basically my manager worked about 50-60 hrs a week because it was he\u2019s always on call. I can go into more details but it\u2019ll just bore you. Feel free to ask and I\u2019ll update if I see the same questions repeated.\n\nEdit 2: This has been brought up many times. I won\u2019t get promoted just because I hustled for a month or two. Management looks over my entire career and time at the company. However, my mentor told me to think of it as having an important project coming up and what will I do to complete it. He said my VP and Manager don\u2019t expect me to keep up the production but are looking to see who is climbing for the open position. He goes on to say with everything being equal (skills, knowledge, etc) there is little chance for a person who religiously work only 40 hrs to be promoted to a position that requires 50-60 hrs. Personally I view the double in pay more than compensate for the increasing hrs.\n\nEdit 3: There has been questions about my coworkers and the ones who are most against my extra work. The one \u201cleading the charge\u201d and making the most noise is a lady in her 50s. She\u2019s been here the longest, longer than even our recently promoted manager. We\u2019ve always had a cordial working relationship but she\u2019s been vicious as of late.\n\nWe\u2019re all supervisors and are on salary. I know some places require sign in sheets for salary positions but we don\u2019t have such constraint. I do know they audit our computer usage to see how much or little we work.\n\nMy colleagues and I all submitted our application and CV for the position. There are other applications from other business units within the company as this is a highly desirable job. \n\nThanks for reading my post and giving me your opinions. I spent the night reading through every one of them. I\u2019ll post an update of my status once I find out in a couple of weeks if anyone is still interested.", "created_utc": 1668776653, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yyjllj/aita_cheating_to_get_a_promotion/", "score": 14236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When the time came, they gave her a perfunctory interview... and then brought in a guy they'd been talking to from outside to take the job.  It was heartbreaking.  But \"that's business.\"", "NTA and not cheating. However consider that if you do get this promotion you will be managing those people. Is it worth to antagonize the whole team? \n\nPerhaps an interesting compromise could be to say that while you don't agree it's cheating, you understand that work life balance is important to them and you don't want to be the outlier that much so while you will still keep working a couple extra hours during the week to help the whole of the team and the current manager to keep up with the tasks since you can afford the extra hours, you will reduce that amount so the disparity isn't that much and keeps more in line with them. And if your manager/vp asks, you can say you had to consider team work as a factor. That also would probably go well for a managing position", "NTA. Different people have different obligations and priorities. If your top priority right now is your career, then rock that shit and land the promotion.

If you DO expect people to work 12-14 days and on weekends in order to get a promotion, then you are a toxic people leader not worthy of having high performing people.   \n\n\nUltimately, your performance should be weighted against the hours you're paid to work and it's an utter failure of your management team now not to encourage you to set healthy and safe boundaries with your work.   \n\n\nYou can't keep doing this, so stop now. And if you're strong willed enough to keep doing this, what's the point of doubling your salary if you don't have free-time to enjoy it?   \n\n\nOn a side note, if you work in the private sector, cut this shit out... devoting this much time to your work just for you to be laid off, under-valued, or treated poorly isn't worth it.

The reward for going above and beyond your job is not a promotion, but rather more work. One of 2 things will happen:\n\n1. You'll be passed over for the promotion because your output at your current role is too high, and losing that will impact the numbers that your VP sees. So they'll keep you in the same role, maybe give you a bit of a raise and expect more output because of the raise. You'll burn out, lose interest in the job and company and eventually quit.

Now after his promotion, the output has reduced and it must be because he can't lead or motivate his team effectively. You have already alienated your team to get this promotion so they have no incentive to step up for you.

That's 400 widgets processed in a 5 day work week.  \n\nYou take work home and process an additional 30 or 40 widgets each weekday and 80 more each day Saturday and Sunday.

None of those has a great outcome and will further alienate your colleagues.  \n\nIn a way this reminds me of Annie Dookhan, Massachusetts crime lab chemist who started fudging her numbers, gained a great reputation, and ended up in jail when the truth came out.

It was not a smart move to tell for colleges about the extra hours to finish operative projects or focus only on operative results (hard operative work doesn't translate on promotion, neither should). One unfortunate and painful lesson to learn.

We all do our best with the results we have (in your case, ambition and free time, so why don't take advantage of that?).

Maybe using of data to present results from the whole department? Maybe you could lead a whole project to identify initiatives?)

Once he's managing, we're back to each person only doing 1750 a week max, meaning they'd have to hire 2 new people to fill OP's current kitten production, or make the others work overtime consistently to compensate. Hiring 2 new people means besides OP's salary being doubled, you're also paying two new people what OP was making, so OP just essentially quadrupled the cost to the company to keep up with the kitten production standard he set.\n\nAlternatively, if OP doesn't get the position, he's probably going to go back to 1750 kittens a week since his current trajectory is not sustainable. Which is also going to reflect badly upon the team since they're still producing 1750+ less kittens a week than they did prior, with OP working overtime + on weekends.", "Yes, because I'm sure you spent years of your life in school and then work so you could be taken care of. /s", "Lol well said", "A few months ago my company was looking for team members to promote as supervisors.
