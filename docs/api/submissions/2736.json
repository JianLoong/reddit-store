{"id": 2736, "submission_id": "yzkbrl", "title": "AITA? She was a little late", "selftext": "So, I (32M) invited this 32F to a first date at my favorite restaurant. I arrived 20 minutes early (the date was at 1pm) as I always do for anything I plan with anyone because I don't want to keep people guessing about my interest in them nor do I want to disrespect their time. If I am going to be late or will be cutting it close, I warn them ahead of time.\n\nAt 12h50, I text her to ask if she is going to be there. No answer. 5 minutes later, I go inside and reserve the table. At 1pm, i assume she stood me up and since I'm at my favorite restaurant, I order my favorite food and sit down for a meal alone. \n\nShe arrives 5 minutes late, which is really no big deal even for me but it does show a lack of respect for my time not to have warned me. I welcome her and tell her that since she was a little late, I had already ordered, then recommended the specialties to her and moved on. I didn't call her out hard or anything. \n\nShe started reading the menu but she looked flustered and after a while, she tells me that she was only a few minutes late. To which I answered yes, and she didn't warn me despite me asking for an update but that it didn't matter now, she was there and I was glad. \n\nShe went back to reading the menu but after a minute she said that she didn't feel like it anymore because I had made her a reproach. I looked at her with a look of disbelief but she reiterated that she didn't feel comfortable anymore. I told her that I didn't want her to be uncomfortable and that she should leave if she felt this way, which she did.\n\nI ate my spicy lemongrass oxtail soup alone which made the trip worth it in itself but I was shocked that an adult would act this way. Late on a first date, no warning, can't handle a gentle callout. How did she survive the real world so far? \n\nAITA here? I know that it was only 5 mimutes but at the same time... if she's late on the first date, what does it spell for the rest of the hypothetical relationship?", "created_utc": 1668887164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzkbrl/aita_she_was_a_little_late/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she was driving, she wouldn\u2019t have had any way to inform you of her lateness, at least not if she doesn\u2019t want to text while driving. Not everyone is 20 minutes early to everything. You waited a total of 30 minutes for her, 25 of which were of your own volition and she was effectively unaware of. If you wanted to actually give her a chance, you should have instead of telling her that you basically couldn\u2019t be bothered to wait for more than 5 minutes for her. Most people take more than 5 minutes to look at the menu and decide what they want to order.", "YTA.\n\nFirst of all, most people don\u2019t plan to arrive 20 min early. At a restaurant, okay. But like as a guest? I would be annoyed if someone showed up that early when I was hosting a dinner or something.\n\nNext, if she was driving, she shouldn\u2019t be texting. And if she was getting off of public transport, she was probably paying attention to where she was going.\n\nIt was rude for you to order without her. \n\nYou made a pretty big deal about 5 min. Traffic and public transport don\u2019t always make it easy to be right on time even if you do plan to be early.", "YTA. I don't even think most people would consider this being late, really. And of course she didn't respond; she was probably driving. Warn you? For 5 freaking minutes? Good lord.", "Good thing she was 5 minutes late and found out YTA", "YTA - 5 minutes is well within the on-time zone. I like to arrive early to appointments, too, but I don\u2019t consider someone late until it\u2019s 15 minutes past the time, minimum.\n\nShe was on the way when you were asking if she was coming - and you gave up on her at 1pm on the dot. You were rigid and hasty.", "YTA , maybe you felt it was too long because you got there so much earlier but it\u2019s not that long , I think 15 minutes after the date time is reasonable time to order if you haven\u2019t heard from date", "Seems like there is a much deeper problem going on. At least that is the impression your post gives and the impression she probably had. Let me explain:\n\nYou asked her before the time of the date if she was gonna show up --> you're insecure and do not trust her\n\nYou then went in and didn't wait outside --> weird, no one does this\n\nYou then told her she was 5 min late --> \"It's just 5 minutes, he seems to be completely non-spontaneous and inflexible\"\n\nYou then told her that BECAUSE she was 5 min late, you already ordered --> \"He either doesn't like me or is bitter. If this goes anywhere, he will probably be always insisting on structure and rules. He doesn't seem fun. He might be controlling. He is probably going to make me uncomfortable if I ever want to reject him or don't immediately reply to his messages. It is best for me to leave now.\"\n\nNothing else matters. Not that she couldn't see the message on her phone, or whatever. She was 5 min late. She most likely did not do that on purpose. If she is 20 something, our generation often tends to be late. 5 min are not a big deal. I suggest you fix your issues, especially focussing on structure and loosen a bit up as this will might cause issues further down your life, even with friends, work etc. YTA", "Sounds like she dodged a bullet...", "It wasn\u2019t a job interview, it was a date. 5 minutes after the agreed upon date time is completely reasonable.

Throwing a fit and moving on is incredibly rude. Maybe she didn\u2019t text you because she was driving? Or her phone died?

What did you do, kidnap a waitress on the way to your table? You were obviously making a statement with that dick move, and it's not just your \"gentle callout\" that turned her off. \n\nI don't blame her from leaving, and good riddance to you.", "YTA. It\u2019s five minutes, learn to have some patience. Even if you personally felt irked, you shouldn\u2019t have said anything, you were being kinda rude. Also, you shouldn\u2019t get mad because she didn\u2019t answer your text within ten minutes, maybe she was driving and didn\u2019t want to be distracted?", "YTA.\n\nIt\u2019s legit five minutes.

You got seated and ordered in 5 minutes! What you did was so off putting that I\u2019m surprised she stayed as long as she did.\n\nIt was a first date which means first impressions mean a lot. First dates mean getting to know someone. She was 5 minutes late and apologetic. Because of 5 freaking minutes you chastised her, made her feel unwelcome by giving her no time to ease in to the date. No, talking over a beverage before ordering\u2026 Nothing. You came across as an overbearing control freak and she absolutely did the right thing when she left. \n\nGet a clue and get over yourself or you will always be having your oxtail lemongrass whatever the f it was alone.\n\nUgh! \ud83d\ude20", "YTA. 5 min is not a big deal. That can be caused by catching a few traffic lights or needing to find a place to park. You are being oversensitive and need to extend people more flexibility.", "Yikes. The \u201creal world\u201d says YTA. \n\nYour \u201cfriend\u201d was only 5 minutes late, your comment and manner are unwarranted. Are you a drill sergeant?

Anything could have happened. You sound insufferable if I'm being honest", "YTA - Jesus you must be fun. Life does not move like a well oiled machine. GOOGLE gives me a wide spread on estimated travel times, sometimes as much as a 45 minute window for onlyv19 minutes. It's called traffic. As to not answering your text, if she were driving of course she didn't reply!\n\nYour response is so over the top ridiculous that I have to wonder if you've got some mental issues.", "YTA but on the bright side you were very effective in demonstrating how much of an pompous ass you are, thus saving her from the mistake of a second date. It was 5 minutes for a *date*, not a NASA launch window, for God's sake.  Before criticizing anyone about adult behavior, you may wanna demonstrate some yourself.", "YTA. Honestly, the minute you started hassling me *before* 1 p.m. I would have cancelled the date. This kind of nagging over minutiae is something I cannot live wirh.", "Smart woman. Glad she realised immediately what she was avoiding.", "Im so confused how you took her being 5 minutes late like she was over an hour late. Bro shes uneasy and flustered because you're fuckin rushing her. Its 5 minutes. People have lives, its a first date calm your man tits.\n YTA I doubt you'll be getting a second date, or rather I hope she ghosts you if possible.", "YTA learn a little patience, not everyone is glued to their phone nor can they control being completely on time... 5 mins is no big deal.", "YTA. Glad you liked the soup.", "I'm so sorry you had to wait a whole 5 minutes while your date obviously wasn't rushing or trying to hurry. Talk about the lack of respect. The real world is going to have their hands full with this one /s\n\nYTA", "YTA, if she was driving she couldn't text you. You set up the date, and said you like to get to places early. There is a good chance she wanted to get there a couple minutes after you did so she A. Knew it was the right place, B. Wasn't waiting somewhere she didn't know. 5 minutes isn't a big deal at all especially during lunch hour traffic. You also definitely could have waited to order, you already knew what you liked but if she hasn't been she would still have to read the menu and decide. Making a deal about the five minutes and already ordering right at 1 is off-putting especially on a first date", "YTA.\nEw yeah I can like *feel* the type of guy you are through the way you wrote this. Probably would expect her to iron your shirts for you 6 months from now too wouldn't you bud?", "The problem with being 20 minutes early is that you then do things like demand to know where someone is and if they're coming 10 minutes before they're supposed to be there.\n\nAnd then decide they've blown you off right at the time they should be arriving, go ahead and order food, and write them off. You've already been 'waiting' 20 minutes, after all. \n\nNormal interactions allow for about a 15 minute 'window' of being late occasionally. Even for first dates. You're on public transport with crappy reception, for example, then just bolt to the destination because transport was a few minutes behind schedule and you think you can make it if you hurry.  \n\nSo yea. YTA. It was, in fact, just 5 minutes. No real harm done tho. If you're this inflexible about a lunch date and she is very put off by it, you may as well find out now.", "YTA \n\n>I know that it was only 5 minutes but at the same time... if she's late on the first date, what does it spell for the rest of the hypothetical relationship?\n\nAll your hypothetical relationships will remain hypothetical if this is how you behave when someone is 5 minutes late. Your rigidity and judgemental behavior will ensure that.", "YTA. She probably saw this as the huge red flag that it is, and chose not to engage with a control freak. Good for her.", "YTA - lower your expectations dude", "Yta. People can be late it happens. It would be different if she was 1/2 hour late or if it\u2019s a chronic problem. 5 minutes late one time isn\u2019t disrespecting your time it\u2019s just life.", "Your behavior would totally stress me out.  5 minutes late is not even close to you being stood up.  Texting someone 10 minutes ahead of your scheduled meeting time to see if they are still coming because they weren't there 10 minutes early is a bit much.  I don't blame her for leaving.  Your behavior on your first date indicates that you would be an inflexible, uptight partner, and that you probably have a tendency to become stressed out about minor things, which indicates that you are potentially difficult to get along with.", "Five minutes is nothing. If I tell someone to meet me somewhere at 1:00, they should expect to see me any time between 12:50 and 1:10. Human beings aren\u2019t robots. Traffic happens, not being able to find your keys, spilling something and having to change clothes, your dog peeing on your floor right before you meant to leave\u2026 life isn\u2019t perfect. I\u2019d have been uncomfortable if a date treated me like a child over arriving five minutes late too. I\u2019m glad she learned that you\u2019re awful on the first date and saved herself some time. YTA", "YTA 5 minutes isn\u2019t even late. She also doesn\u2019t owe you an update about being 5 minutes late. \n\nStop showing up so early and maybe you won\u2019t be on edge when your date arrives on time.", "YTA, the lack of grace on your part shows that she was absolutely right to leave. \nShe could have been on a subway, looking for parking, any number of things. Most adults in the word meeting for dinner do not order food at exactly on the dot at the time set for meeting. \n\nAlso pretty impressive that your soup magically showed up in less than 5 minutes. Sounds more like you ordered before 1. \n\nEither way she clearly dodged a bullet.", "Once upon a time, I set off early to arrive somewhere, and then managed to hit **every single** red stoplight on the way to my destination. I should have been 5-10 minutes early. I ended up being 5 minutes late. I don't text and drive, so there was no way to tell my friends I wasn't arriving on time.\n\nBut you know what? They didn't care. Because 5 minutes is hardly anything. \n\nI say this as an autistic person who is dead-set on arriving on time every-time, if not early. And I *will* sit in my car in front of someone's house, only getting out at the *exact* time of arrival on the *dot* and go up to the door so I'm *exactly* on time. \n\nThroughout my years of experience, I've learned that unless it's clocking in for work, most people arrive around the general time expected. A little early, a little late. Hardly ever exactly on time. 5 minutes is is a socially acceptable time-frame to be late with for general society. Do I arrive late myself? Not if I can help it. But it is what it is.\n\nYou're insensitive. \n\nYTA", "I'm sure she survives the adult world just fine.  \n\nMost sane people who are not on the spectrum aren't such sticklers for time that they act up over 5 minutes.  \n\nAt 20 minutes, you'd have a complaint. An hour, you get to be indignant.  \n\nNot 5 minutes. \n\nYTA", "YTA. you scolded her for being 5 minutes late. it sounds like you care more about the oxtail soup than the fact that you were an asshole.", "YTA. You sound super controlling and I would leave also.", "Yeah, YTA, for reasons everyone has covered.\n\nI do understand having to be early to everything. I'm like that. But so is my husband. The right partner for you will share this quirk, so it's good you both found out right away to go your separate ways.", "YTA\nShe found that out at the perfect time too!", "YTA. This is neurotic level", "YTA, sorry but texting someone before the arranged time because they aren't there yet is absurd.  She wasn't even late when you started acting like she was.  5 minutes is not a long enough time to get impatient and order food and write her off.  All this is coming from someone who hates being late.  You were way out of line with your expectations and I don't blame her for leaving.", "YTA. \nAlready ordering when someone\u2019s not there after 3 or 4 minutes, as you said she was 5 late and already ordered, is completely weird and might feel like kind of passive aggression. It\u2019s a critic cause you show her she\u2018s done \u201asomething wrong\u2018. Have you been dumped a lot in your life or how comes you think she\u2018s not coming after that little time of waiting? I mean it\u2019s really weird\u2026", "YTA because sometimes I\u2019m 10 min early and still can\u2019t find parking. 5 minutes late and 45 minutes late are two very different things. A car accident traffic jam, low tire pressure warning, construction pop up, or really anything could result in a couple min late. You sound miserable to date though so I hope she bounces", "YTA. Why would you order your meal without her present on a first date? Particularly after five minutes. Bizarre behavior.", "YTA\n\nI am a punctuality freak. Seriously. It drives me insane whenever I feel I might be a minute late for any sort of appointment. However I know most people are not like this and I cannot expect everyone to be like me, so I try to cut people some slack.\n\nI can see your point but I think your reaction was a bit too much. I would say for a date like this, 10 mins would be totally acceptable. If it became a pattern though, I admit I would be a annoyed.", "YTA. Sometimes people are late due to things unexpected, like traffic. Did you expect her to text and drive? Maybe she could not find a parking spot. Also, who meets RIGHT EXACTLY on time?  Most people wait 10-15 minutes before they call others \"late\". You're one of those uptight people who expect everyone to follow your rules. Seriously, YTA,", "I can see why your still single...YTA", "YTA.\nFive minutes late is hitting a patch of bad traffic. Five minutes late is having to stop for every red light on the trip. Five minutes late could even be driving around to find a parking spot. Five minutes is *nothing* in the global scheme of things.\n\nNot to mention, if she was actually *driving* she wouldn't have had the opportunity to read or reply to your text. By the way, you sent your texts *before* the agreed-upon meetup time. They might have been appropriate ten minutes after the meeting time, but you need to give people time to arrive on time (with a grace period!) Before you start assuming they are late.\n\nYTA. A rigid AH with ridiculous expectations of others. She just dodged a huge bullet. Enjoy your continued singlehood...", "YTA.  I can't even figure out how you make an issue of absolutely nothing.   Although. The writing style, and use of key words screams Incel  so really it all makes sense.", "How did she survive the real world? Get off your high horse dude. A date with you isn\u2019t life or death. I\u2019m glad she dodged that bullet.", "YTA. \n5 minutes. And you already ordered within those minutes before she showed up? \nI can imagine a relationship with you being just as passive aggressive.", "YTA for the love of god it is 5 minutes so many things could have happened to make her 5 minutes late.", "YTA. If these are the standards you set and way you act, it's a good thing you see value in experiences over people, because you'll be experiencing things single", "YTA\n\nHere's my take, as someone who is chronically early to everything, having a weird anxiety about parking, logistics, and embarrassment from being late.\n\nFive minutes late is NOTHING.  Literally nothing.  Clocks could have been off.  A bus got in front of you.  You had to go back in the house because you forgot your phone.  It's nothing.\n\nWhat happened here, I think, is a process I know well.  Slow building anticipation as you wait.  Time feels MUCH longer when you're waiting anxiously.  By getting there so early, you made it so those last few minutes felt like WAY longer than they actually were.\n\nI'm not saying you need to stop getting places early.  You need to understand that the \"timer\" starts on lateness at the time you were scheduled to arrive.  Five minutes is just not a big deal.  \n\n\nOh, and it's CERTAINLY not worth calling out on a first date.  If you like the person, go on a couple of dates, and they're always 10 minutes late, fine.  Either plan on it being late, or have a chat.  Five minutes late once does not demand a \"gentle callout\".  \n\n\nAlso, you ORDERED already?  What? That's such a weird move.", "YTA. She wasn't even late. Even restaurants give 15 minutes of grade. You're too rigid to be in a relationship with another human.", "You\u2019re actually ridiculous.\n\nYTA", "It\u2019s very obvious why you are single. You are a huge AH for what you did. It was only 5 minutes! WTF! YTA", "YTA No offense but you sound awful. She was five minutes late. Five minutes? You need to check yourself. \n\nAlso this lucky person sounds like they dodged a bullet.", "Yta", "YTA.", "YTA. I hate being late and I am always early but I\u2019d never act like you did over someone being FIVE minutes late.", "YTA. It\u2019s 5 freaking minutes. You were waiting for forever because you were super early and then were questioning her before she was even late. Gonna be hard to date people if this is how you approach it. She was right to leave.", "YTA! She was literally 5 mins late and I would imagine she didn\u2019t respond because she was on her way. It\u2019s sooo rude if you to order your food at EXACTLY 1pm without giving her a little leeway to get there. I could understand if it was 115 and she still hadn\u2019t showed up but goodness, how ridiculous you are. I don\u2019t blame her for leaving, she got a glimpse of what a potential relationship with you would be like.", "I'm big on punctuality, but it was five minutes.  Calm the fuck down.  If you're going to get hung up on that, then you'll never be happy with anyone.", "YTA. How do YOU survive the real world being this rigid and unaware?!", "I\u2019m also shocked that you (AN ADULT) literally couldn\u2019t wait 5 minutes before ordering. I agree that being late is disrespectful, but it\u2019s also dangerous AF to text while driving, clearly she was close enough that she was driving. You couldn\u2019t even wait ONE FUCKING MINUTE before you ordered your food. You could have ordered an appetizer and drink but you went straight to your meal.\n\nHonestly, sounds like she dodged a controlling AF bullet. Yta. Massively.", "YTA!! Thank you for showing your true behavior, it made it easier to her to identify the trash..\n\nUsually dudes are good at hiding their worst traits for at least 5 dates", "YTA. Maybe give her a little grace. 5 mins is not a big deal, certainly not enough time to be accosted about.", "YTA. It\u2019s 5 minutes\u2026life happens. 5 minutes late is socially acceptable in most all situations.", "YTA. Women usually do more to prepare themselves for a date.  It\u2019s irresponsible to be looking at one\u2019s phone while driving.  Many people get nervous before a first date. Traffic can be unexpectedly bad when going to a new place.\n\nThe only salvation here is that you clearly warned her about your behavior right away, so that she could avoid stressing herself out by spending more time with you.", "YTA. People hit traffic, 5min is not an unreasonable amount of time for her to be late, and she may not have texted back because she was on the way. It sounds like you were nervous, showed up way too early, then took it out on her when she showed up. Rookie mistake, do better next time.\n\nEDIT: I see that she was taking the metro. Most public transit systems are not reliable enough to guarantee that you won't be 5min late to some things sometimes. It's really not a big deal, and doesn't show any ill intention.", "YTA", "YTA, omg. She was probably driving there when you were demanding an unreasonable update. Try not showing up 20 minutes early and it won\u2019t be a big deal if someone is a measly 5 minutes late.", "YTA she was 5 minutes late! More I'd understand . Probably trying to find parking and couldn't text. You were there way early and as it turned into on time you said she was late. I'm not surprised if there's no second date.", "YTA", "Honestly, I\u2019m not sure how you have survived in the real world with an attitude like this. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. What? 5 minutes!? I think you need to re-examine how you treat social interactions and people in general.", "YTA. I\u2019m glad she left you", "Yta she was a few minutes late. Even a job gives you seven before they dock you.", "YTA and it seems weird you didn't know that already", "Yta", "YTA. Yeah let me just text and drive to tell you, someone I've never met, imma be a bit late. Next time think like a logical adult :)", "YTA. People being late is my biggest pet peeve but you didn\u2019t even wait a little bit after 1:00pm to order! Of course she isn\u2019t going to text you if she\u2019s in the middle of driving there. Confirm the date earlier in the day and be a little more patient.", "Y T A.  Five minutes late is not really bad and honestly a traffic delay, parking etc can cause this.  She didn't need to check in with you and you sound way to controlling, or if not controlling, unrealistic expectations", "YTA. By sending the message just before the time you were supposed to meet, rather than confirming the day before or the morning of, you made it weird. Don\u2019t do that.", "YTA. She likely didn\u2019t text you because she was driving to you and was being responsible by not looking at her phone. 5 minutes late is not unusual nor is it rude. You decided to give her shit about this on your very first date? I wonder why you\u2019re single.", "YTA\n\n5 minutes, and an attitude because she didn\u2019t let you know. Depending on how she traveled, she may not use her phone while driving or, if public transport, didn\u2019t want to whip out a phone and risk that. 5 minutes could be any reason. You\u2019re only upset, I\u2019d bet, because you arrived early and your perception of your wait was skewed by that.", "How dare she, you sound like such a peach! Just kidding, **YTA**\n\nYou keep judging her but maybe take a look at your own manners.", "Yta for demanding to know why she wasn't early. You sound very incompatible.", "Did this girl a huge favor by showing her your true colors immediately. YTA", "YTA. If you're this controlling and weird about the first date, she was right to leave. People like you don't get better with time. You escalate. If you haven't abused partners in the past, you certainly have the capacity for it. Go to therapy. And in the meantime, stop trying to date anyone.", "YTA. People generally can\u2019t respond (or read) texts while driving.", "YTA!

I arrived 20 minutes early (the date was at 1pm) as I always do for anything I plan with anyone because I don't want to keep people guessing about my interest in them nor do I want to disrespect their time. If I am going to be late or will be cutting it close, I warn them ahead of time.\n\nAt 12h50, I text her to ask if she is going to be there. No answer. 5 minutes later, I go inside and reserve the table. At 1pm, i assume she stood me up and since I'm at my favorite restaurant, I order my favorite food and sit down for a meal alone. \n\nShe arrives 5 minutes late, which is really no big deal even for me but it does show a lack of respect for my time not to have warned me. I welcome her and tell her that since she was a little late, I had already ordered, then recommended the specialties to her and moved on. I didn't call her out hard or anything. \n\nShe started reading the menu but she looked flustered and after a while, she tells me that she only a few minutes late. To which I answered yes, and she didn't warn me despite me asking for an update but that it didn't matter now, she was there and I was glad. \n\nShe went back to reading the menu but after a minute she said that she didn't feel like it anymore because I had made her a reproach. I looked at her with a look of disbelief but she reiterated that she didn't feel comfortable anymore. I told her that I didn't want her to be uncomfortable and that she should leave if she felt this way, which she did.\n\nI ate my spicy lemongrass oxtail soup alone w\nhich made the trip worth it in itself but I was shocked that an adult would act this way. Late on a first date, no warning, can't handle a gentle callout. How did she survive the real world so far? \n\nAITA here? I know that it was only 5 mimutes but at the same time... if she's late on the first date, what does it spell for the rest of the hypothetical relationship?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Seriously? You sent a text 10 min beforehand? And assumed she stood you up right on the dot? It\u2019s not her fault you\u2019re super early. And I know I\u2019m the early one usually.

I think it is extremely immature the way you acted.", "YTA. You essentially accused her of being late 10 minutes before the agreed time by checking if she was on her way.

The date was for 1pm you arrived at 12:40 and at 12:50 you texted to ask your date if she was coming, insinuating she was already late? Then at exactly 1pm on the dot you went inside and ordered your food immediately upon sitting down by 1:05 when she arrived you had already ordered? \n\nYTA dude, learn to be a little accommodating of people and dont push your bullshit people should be extra early to not be considered late attitude on others. One time being 5 minutes late should not even be blip of consideration nor should it be considered being late.", "YTA, jesus fucking christ dude. Even the fact that you're comfortable very obviously lying about how much it really did affect you, just so you can garner enough positive feedback so you can justify your own shitty actions, tells it how it is. You reiterate maybe 3 times how much her being 5 MINUTES late did not bother you, but her being 5 minutes is the reason WHY you treated her like shit, and if she felt flustered and pointed out that she was only \"that\" many minutes late, it's very obvious that you deliberately tried to make it a point that you were in fact bothered.\n\nEdit: added some words", "Dude she was 5 min late give her a break. Just because you\u2019re compulsively early to thing doesn\u2019t mean she should be. You didn\u2019t even give her any leeway at all.

Yeah YTA. 15 min leeway should be given", "YTA, you sound intolerable.\n\nGlad she called you out, because she was just 5 mins late.\n\nShe could have been driving? looking for parking? \n\nAlso sounds like something is missing because you must have said a little more than she was late, and moved on", "YTA.  The better question is how did you survive the real world?  You took a completely innocent situation and blew it up.  Did it ever occur to you that she didn\u2019t return your text because she was being responsible in the real world and didn\u2019t text while driving!", "YTA but maybe you can find someone else who is like you, who values being prompt above being kind.", "How do you warn someone you're going to be 5 minutes late, without texting while driving?\n\nStop, and stop expecting this. It's bad form.", "YTA dude, you couldn\u2019t have waited 5 minutes without ordering something or being snide? Of course she was uncomfortable. I would have been too if I arrived to a date and I saw that my company was already annoyed at me for being reasonably late. Hell, even most workplaces give you a 5 minute grace period.", "YTA. You started harassing her ten minutes before she was even supposed to be there, decided she had stood you up when she was less than ten seconds late, and then were condescending a judgemental when she showed up at a completely reasonable time. Good on her for leaving instead of suffering through one more minute of your self-centered bullshit.", "YTA. She didn\u2019t respond to your text because she was driving.

Do you ever wonder why you\u2019re single?", "5 minutes are 2 red lights. Come on.", "YTA.\n\nBig up your date for leaving too.  5 minutes late on a social call is NOT late.

Obviously you know YTA, you must just need some karma/attention", "YTA. Not only was was *5 minutes late* and you felt the need to say something, but you said it when she *wasn\u2019t 10 minutes early*. You didn\u2019t even wait until she was actually late to ask where she was. You couldn\u2019t wait more than 5 minutes to order your food. You sound controlling and weird. You sound selfish too. Who starts the meal when the other person is barely 5 mins late? That\u2019s rude. She dodged a bullet. \n\nI\u2019m from a major US city and I\u2019ve been a few mins late to things often due to subway/public transportation issues / delays outside my control. Often there is no cell service in subterranean transportation. It\u2019s just sort of a fact of life, and no one cares until you\u2019re like 20 mins late. \n\nOne time the entire system went completely upside down and all trains in the city wound up delayed. I had no cell service. I was on my way to my then semi-new boyfriend\u2019s mom\u2019s birthday dinner at a super fancy restaurant. I was sweating bullets with nerves because I couldn\u2019t tell anyone I was extremely late. I considered just not going and making an excuse. I ended up being 45 minutes late and when I got there, they were not there. I was told they had not yet arrived. They showed up 10-15 mins later because they had the same issue, so they got off the train as soon as possible and tried to get a cab, which took forever and then traffic was a nightmare bc of everyone taking cabs during the train shitshow. So it all worked out but nobody was mad that anyone was late because *shit happens* \n\nAnd you can\u2019t even wait five minutes. \n\nIn places I\u2019ve lived that are primarily driving cities, I\u2019m not going to text and drive just to answer an inquiry about where I am *10 minutes before I\u2019m supposed to actually be anywhere*. \n\nAlso who tf shows up for everything 20 minutes early? That\u2019s also weird. Just because you have this strange hang up about being super early does not mean everyone else has to, nor is anyone else psychic to know you have this bizarre expectation.

Shocking to believe you\u2019re 32 and single with behavior like this\u2026", "YTA. You show signs of being wildly controlling and unforgiving of the tiniest perceived slight.

You should just date yourself.", "YTA, it's commendable that you're punctual in that manner; not a lot of people are. It is, however, very common for people to be between 5 and 10 minutes late.

The fact that you WENT AHEAD AND ORDERED at 1 pm (the time of the date) because you assumed you were stood up is what gets me. I would be totally flustered and turned off.

Expecting a response to a text within 10 minutes is ludicrous, not everyone is glued to their phone and responds to texts immediately especially while driving.  \n\nOrdering food 5 minutes after the scheduled time was a hard asshole move.  Order a drink sure or maybe an appetizer to share but don\u2019t order your meal.  Someone deserves at least 15 minutes of a grace period when meeting for social events before you text or assume they aren\u2019t coming.

I don\u2019t know where you come from, but most western cultures it is common practice to grant 15 mins tolerance at a restaurant before ordering food (ordering drinks while you wait is OK, but not waiting even 5 mins before your party arrives to order already food is considered rude). Where you so famished that you could not wait 5 friggin minutes before ordering? \n\nYou said you were very polite and had a smile on your face when you called her out on this, but have you considered that perhaps your tone came across as condescending or passive aggressive?  \n\nBy the way, being on time means being right *on time* not 20 mins earlier. Some cultures consider that just as rude as being late.", "I consider being on time super important, lived and worked in Japan for years where punctuality is a huge deal, and show up everywhere like 15-20 minutes early like yourself, just in case.\n\nI also recognise that the vast majority of normal people don\u2019t share this perception. Almost anyone you asked would say that someone who is five minutes late is not \u2018really\u2019 late. I would maybe text at ten past. I\u2019d be a bit annoyed by quarter past. I wouldn\u2019t order for someone, or leave, until at least half past, if they hadn\u2019t texted or rung to explain.\n\nIt\u2019s fine for you to have criteria for punctuality for yourself. But these are not most people\u2019s criteria. You were holding her to a standard she was not even AWARE of (unless in a previous conversation you\u2019d explained you her everywhere twenty minutes early?!), immediately putting her on the spot and making her feel she had to defend herself when she had not, by most people\u2019s standards, done anything wrong or shown you any disrespect. Have your own rules and standards as much as you like, but you can\u2019t make other people live by them when they don\u2019t even know. You were incredibly passive aggressive. No wonder she felt uncomfortable. \n\nYTA.", "There\u2019s been several people that have commented that they are like you and are extremely punctual. However, unlike you, they would not assume someone who is 5 minutes late was ditching them and order their own food. That\u2019s why YTA.", "I don't think it's about \"aren't paid for it\". It's more like that sometimes you mess up your timing a bit and you are late. At least in my culture it is still considered ok (not good, but ok) to be late up to 15 minutes. You were to meet up at 13. She arrives 13:05, most people have not gotten to the end of menu with in 5 minutes, you had already ordered. It seems a bit too heisty, like you were not expecting her to come. Or the woman just felt that if this 5 minutes is too much, she will never meet your expectations in a relationship and there is no point of continuing the date.", "Question: have you always been so self-sabotaging in your personal relationships, or is this a relatively new development?\n\nSounds to me like you intentionally torpedoed this date over 5 minutes. If you actually liked this person and wanted to see them, that would be nothing to wait. Do you actually want a relationship, or are you just looking for any excuse to not make a connection?", "The date was supposed to start at 1:00, and at 1:00 OP decided she stood him up and ordered lunch alone. She wasn\u2019t even late yet. \n\nI\u2019d argue _that_ is more disrespectful than being 5 minutes late.", "Being late is the rudest thing someone can do? Even just 5 min late? WTF. You must live with a lot of perfect people lol. SMH", "Really, I can think of alllll kinda of things that are far more rude than a a single instance of being 5 minutes late.", "I meant more like you could sit in the parking lot and wait.", "I\u2019m starting to leans towards satire. The unnecessary details OP includes (like the flavor soup he got) are just so very bizarre\u2026but then again I\u2019ve known some truly inflexible people in my life who had ridiculous expectations for how others should act in their presence, so there\u2019s a decent chance OP could be for real.", "I can believe it. My sister is this type of person.", "..or find someone just as rigid.", "YTA h\n\n\nNot because you went into the restaurant.... But because you decided to order at the exact moment the date was MEANT to start rather than 5 minutes later when it ACTUALLY started...... And you tried to blame your date for daring to be late in what seems to be sub zero temps whilst knowing she was using public transport?! YTA!", "Omg you are a pompous inflexible stickler\u2026", "My guy, people are criticizing you because you come across as arrogant and completely inflexible. This is a forum welcoming criticism. If you can\u2019t deal with that then you are in the wrong place. This isn\u2019t toxic, it\u2019s honest.", "Bullet? No. She dodged a big, fat, sanctimonious missile.", "A big, sanctimonious, rigid bullet.", "you went to the court of public opinion and now you don't like the verdict. \n\nyou scolded her. called her out. however you want to phrase it, that was way ruder than being 5 minutes late. i would have left the date too. how can you not see that you made the situation awkward?\n\nno one person on this earth is perfect but you've gotta give people some grace. if you start off date 1 by being insulted that she was 5 minutes late and \"inconsiderate\" of your time (which you clearly were or you wouldn't have brought it up), i shouldn't have to tell you as a fully formed adult why there won't be a date 2.", "Oh, it\u2019s scolding. 5 minutes late to a social engagement is not late, it\u2019s not a thing. Ordering without her and mentioning to her that you ordered because she was late was super rude and scolds. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with you but I\u2019m zero surprised she had some self respect and left after being treated like that.", "She should have scolded you for not waiting longer. You couldn't just grab an appetizer and show a little tolerance?\n\nYou think you were showing tolerance, but you weren't. You were being massively inflexible and unwilling to be inconvenienced. Big red flag.", "YTA!", "You couldn't have the good grace for her to get there.  Then you make recommendations and make her feel rushed and judged.  Dude, YTA.  Big time.  \n\nYou probably order the same select items every time you go there, it my guess.", "Being on time is not a bad trait. Your reaction to someone being 5 mins late for a social event is a bad trait. You sound hella boring and stuck up, I think she dodged a bullet here", "A date is not a job.  Do not compare apples to footed PJs here.    \n\n\nBut, the fact that you mentioned that she was 5 minutes late indicated to her that you will hold grudges for small things and notice every flaw and bring it up \"with a smile\" with is condescending.  There was probably the jump in her brain that \"you just mention these things so she can be a better version of herself\" because red flags always start small.  I can absolutely see why she no longer felt comfortable and left.", "I think you missed their point. Either that or you\u2019re being intentionally obtuse.", "They are not saying being on time is a bad trait. The rigidness, passive aggressiveness and lack of empathy/social awareness are the bad traits. But you can learn from this experience and improve your flexibility and compassion for others. I think that will probably improve your dating life and general relationships.", "I think he just wanted his spicy lemongrass oxtail soup \ud83d\ude02", "Or get just desserts", "No, I saw I\u2019m in the minority. I still disagree. Guess I\u2019m an asshole too, oh well.", "Wouldn't you assume that there might be unexpected circumstances and leave a little earlier? That's what I did and it wasn't a herculean task.", "OP said it was -10.  She probably had gloves on. You can\u2019t text with most gloves.  \n\nPlus 10 minutes before, she was probably watching for the stop, getting off the metro then walking to the restaurant so didn\u2019t even pull her phone out so never saw his text.", "THIS - Date being lectured by OP with a smile on his face was what liklely made her decide that she was uncomfortable and eventually leave. Dude obviously doesn't have a clue. SMH. YTA", "THIS RIGHT HERE.  OP placed his order at 1 exactly. And then had the audacity to call out his date about being 5 min late.  Newsflash to OP Smoo - most people would consider what OP did, WAY more rude.  OP is definitely YTA.", "I know what you meant and i know op waited outside, but im just saying that i used to waitress as a student and a lot of people just showed up veeeery early and wait awkwardly asking \" well we booked a table, didn't you keep one for us?\" ... well... we will have one ready... at the time of the booking...", "Including the flavour of the soup threw me off too, admittedly. It was at that point that I decided it was satire rather than an actual serious post ... unless he really, really just wanted to let us know that minute detail.", "100% this. Go in, get a drink and read reddit for 10-15 min. When she arrives you say something like \"hey, I hope you don't mind I got a drink. Can I get you something?\"\n\nYTA", "It was five minutes my guy. You didn\u2019t die bc she was five minutes late", "Wouldn't you assume that there might be unexpected circumstances and wait a little longer? That's what everyone else does and it isn't a herculean task", "If I had arrived 20 minutes ahead of a scheduled date, I would know I'd be waiting awhile and would only worry if they hadn't shown 20 minutes past the agreed upon time...not 5 minutes.", "It wasn't a herculean task for you. I don't know the metro schedules but I used to ride the bus. Let's say bus only runs once an hour. If I take the early but I will be waiting at least an hour for my date. If I take the later bus I might be five minutes late, depending on if the bus is on schedule. If it's running five minutes late I'm not going to be looking at my phone. I'm going to be walking as quickly as possible to meet my date. I would assume I have a little leeway because my date knows I'm on the bus.", "It was 5 minutes. Not like 2 hours and getting scammed by the weed guy because he used to be your best friend before he took a turn for the worse.", "Giving others a little bit of grace may help you in your future dating endeavors. Try relaxing a bit - you sound very tightly wound. Oh, and YTA.", "What kind of a control freak are you? Each comment on your part gets creepier and creepier.", "It\u2019s not reasonable to expect someone else to be early just because you\u2019re early. Texting her at 1250 to ask if she\u2019s going to be there is unreasonable. It\u2019s making it sound like she\u2019s already late, which at that point she isn\u2019t. If you wanted to confirm beforehand that she\u2019s coming, you do it hours before - not minutes. Assuming she\u2019s not coming just because she\u2019s not there dead on 1pm is ridiculous. Most normal people would wait 5-10 mins and THEN try to contact the person to see if they\u2019re still coming, not go through this process before the agreed meeting time! How much of your life are you wasting by being 20 mins early for everything?? Wish I had that much time to spare", "Leaving a little earlier doesn't change the train schedule. She either would have had to get an earlier train (like 30 min earlier) or.... you could just suck it up and not be passive aggressive about 5 minutes?"]}
