AITA for not understanding how she can give up on us so easily when we spent every day together for the last 4 years and we own 2 dogs together?

Some cultures are extremely tough to break out of, especially when there is a strong family unit upbringing/dynamic and it's the parents themselves putting the pressure on your GF. I don't envy being in her shoes, it's a terrible position to be in.", "NAH\n\nThis can really be a generational thing.  You don\u2019t understand how upsetting it is for her to have her parents disown her?  Some cultures are very strict when it comes to marriage outside of their beliefs.  \n\n4 years and the life you\u2019ve built isn\u2019t anything to walk away from either.  How have you been together for so long and this is only coming up now?  This is such a hard situation, I\u2019m really sorry.", "NTA\n\nSome cultures are just REALLY racist/prejudice/different... and some adults aren't able to cut the cord from their parents/establish boundaries and independence...\n\nLike you, I don't really understand how people can be like that...\n\nHope she grows a spine and you didn't waste 4 yrs of your life...", "NTA\n\nWhile you may not understand the familial pressure, keep in mind that her culture may be utterly dominating and that she may not see another way.", "NTA.  Consider that she is young.  However, family opposition in many cultures is a deal breaker.  Love does not conquer all.  That said, consider planning some trips or events that put you into contact with multi-cultural communities that are thriving.  Make friends with other mixed race couples.  If she can befriend and get support from other women that have successfully navigated 'stormy waters' with family, she might mature enough to get perspective on 'mom and dad'.", "[deleted]", "NTA 4 years into a relationship and she pulls the \"we gotta break up because my parents won't approve of us\"? Even if that were true, it is totally upsetting that her instant reaction was to give up. Then why wait 4 years??", "NTA. I come from a culture where interracial relationships are taboo. My guess is your GF has kept your relationship completely separate from her relationship with her parents, because she knows they cannot coexist. She may have even done this subconsciously because she's always known deep down that her parents will disapprove. The parental hold on even adult kids can be ridiculously strong. This is a tough one, you may not be able to figure it out with her, unless she's willing to blow up her relationship with her parents, which she likely cannot fathom. I'm so sorry you're in this situation.", "NTA I am so sorry you are having to deal with this.  I don\u2019t envy her either. No one should have to choose between their family and love.  I am shocked that you have been dating as long as you have without this coming up before now.  She had to know that this could be an issue with her family and that they might not approve. If their approval is more important to her than your relationship it doesn\u2019t seem right that she allowed the situation to go on this long.  \n\nI think you need to protect yourself at this point.  If her family is not likely to ever accept you, and she isn\u2019t willing to defy them or be okay if they cut contact with her then the relationship may be over.", "NTA but you\u2019re fighting an uphill battle on this that I doubt you\u2019re ever gonna be able to win. Her family isn\u2019t going anywhere and you don\u2019t want to go anywhere, understandably so.\n\nYour gf seems a little immature and easily impressionable and you will have a tough time inning that fight.", "I don\u2019t know. Five years age difference isn\u2019t a lot, but the difference between who you are as a person at 20 and who you are at 25 is pretty huge.\n\nI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m not married to the person I started dating when I was 20. Especially if I would have had to give up my relationship with my family in the process.\n\nI don\u2019t think you should ever need to convince someone of the fact that they should be with you. It\u2019s probably time to part ways.\n\nAnd I have a tiny gut feeling that you\u2019re the asshole, and that you\u2019re trying to manipulate your much younger girlfriend into believing she\u2019s an asshole, in order to get her to stay with you. (Dear Dude\u2019s GF, Trust your gut. Get out.)", "YTA \n\nIf the roles were reversed, then you would have been raised the way she was and you would have been forbidden from being with her, and you likely would have done the exact same thing and tried to break it off with her. \n\nIf you don't understand her well enough to understand what she did, then you probably haven't taken a lot of time to learn anything about her. That does not sound like a healthy relationship.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong... I have no patience for this sort of cultural bullshit, but you might as well be telling someone with PTSD to just get over it, because in some ways that's kind of what you're doing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

How has it come to pass that you haven't met them yet ?  Has she told them that she has been dating you for 4 years?", "My understanding is that it's unfortunately common for people from arranged marriage cultures who live in love marriage cultures to have Western-style relationships when they are in their early-to-mid 20s and then leave them to join the arranged marriage demanded by their families.  It sounds like you're a victim of this, and I'm so sorry for your experience.\n\nNTA because she ought to have been upfront with you that she would have to be in a marriage her parents approved, and they will never approve of you because you do not share their culture (and possibly their caste).", "Nta, but you are doomed.

The same reason I as a Muslim( even though I\u2019m not a staunch follower) will probably never marry someone out of my religion, not because I\u2019m not attracted to them or hate but cause of our incompatibility.", "Thank you, that\u2019s what I was thinking as well.", "Thank you for your comment, I agree.", "No she spends Holidays with my family, but not vice versa.
