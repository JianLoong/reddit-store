I have looked after my little nephew a couple of times but it's always been planned weeks in advance with time scheduled, constant communication available with parents, food organised and activities planned. They need alot of supervision and care at that vulnerable age. It's odd that a parent would just bail like that to run 'errands'. Somethings up.", "NTA.

Once burned...", "Do you consider yourself friends or strictly roommates? Because friends actually watch their friends' children for free. Not that you are obligated to, but if no payment was discussed, why would the dad assume he needs to pay you? (Although he was totally wrong for taking advantage of you... He said a few hours and it turned into 8 hours. That is unacceptable.)\n\nEven if you're not exactly friends, you've been living together long enough to where you might expect one another to do occasional favors for each other. Again, not that you're obligated to do these favors, but it makes life easier for both of you when you can count on each other for favors of convenience. Do you ever ask him or his wife to do you favors around the house?\n\nI think the problem is communication here. When he asks you to babysit, offer your services for a fee if that's what you want. Tell him what you charge and if he wants your services bad enough, he'll pay for them.", "NTA... but, honestly, I probably would have moved out as soon as they had the child. I'm sorry, but I think a  married couple with a small child should not have a roommate.

If you want to babysit again in the future, set boundaries and consequences. Make it clear that he has to earn your trust again (this is assuming you want to do this work with him). You could do something like offer to babysit for $x/hour, with a $XX deposit up front. If he goes over the agreed time by an hour, your rate for that time doubled. 2 hours or more late? The rate quadrupled. Make the deposit enough to cover 8 hours of quadruple pay.
