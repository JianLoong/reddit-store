It\u2019s good that you refused because otherwise this would just be the same as last time.", "NTA, it's not your kid nor your responsibility. Your responsibility is to your health and your job, both of which will suffer if you don't get to sleep during the day.

He took advantage last time and its good that you nipped it in the bud. His wife agrees with you aswell so at least you have that backup. \n\nYou work nights, he knows this, but still thought being 6 hours late was acceptable. A paid babysitter would be hacked off expecting the parents to come home at 10 but them walk through the door at 4am, how is this different?\n\nHe needs to get used to running errands with a 4yo in tow. Parents do it all the time.", "As a fellow nightshifter so many dayshift people just don't understand somehow how difficult it is to do these things during the day.

Even if he got lunch and visited a shop or two for fun + business duties, that's a fairly long time to be gone. A full work shift to be exact.  An unreasonable period of time to be gone from child, and an unreasonable expectation of you to give that much of your sleep time.  Y'all need to sit down and discuss this...and make sure wife is aware how long he's steppin' out.", "NTA - he has to earn your trust again.", "NTA So he could do his errands with his child but it will be \"not do much fun\". I guess he can't. go out 8 hours like last time and really just do important errands. This is the life of a parent. You can't just toss your child on someone else with lying and do your thing. And you can bet that he planned 8h when he asked you last time. And i wouldn't be surprised if he also had taken his time this time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
