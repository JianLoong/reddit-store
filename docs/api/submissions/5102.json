I have looked after my little nephew a couple of times but it's always been planned weeks in advance with time scheduled, constant communication available with parents, food organised and activities planned. They need alot of supervision and care at that vulnerable age. It's odd that a parent would just bail like that to run 'errands'. Somethings up.", "NTA.

Once burned...", "Do you consider yourself friends or strictly roommates? Because friends actually watch their friends' children for free. Not that you are obligated to, but if no payment was discussed, why would the dad assume he needs to pay you? (Although he was totally wrong for taking advantage of you... He said a few hours and it turned into 8 hours. That is unacceptable.)\n\nEven if you're not exactly friends, you've been living together long enough to where you might expect one another to do occasional favors for each other. Again, not that you're obligated to do these favors, but it makes life easier for both of you when you can count on each other for favors of convenience. Do you ever ask him or his wife to do you favors around the house?\n\nI think the problem is communication here. When he asks you to babysit, offer your services for a fee if that's what you want. Tell him what you charge and if he wants your services bad enough, he'll pay for them.", "NTA... but, honestly, I probably would have moved out as soon as they had the child. I'm sorry, but I think a  married couple with a small child should not have a roommate.

If you want to babysit again in the future, set boundaries and consequences. Make it clear that he has to earn your trust again (this is assuming you want to do this work with him). You could do something like offer to babysit for $x/hour, with a $XX deposit up front. If he goes over the agreed time by an hour, your rate for that time doubled. 2 hours or more late? The rate quadrupled. Make the deposit enough to cover 8 hours of quadruple pay.

Nope, you gotten taken advantage of when babysitting was supposed to be for a few hours (which to most people means 2-3 hours max) and this stretched I to 8, when the dad took this opportunity to be child-free to his own advantage. \n\nThis father/roommate needs to seriously consider the going rate for a babysitter, as it isn\u2019t the cost of pizza, that you didn\u2019t ask for in lieu of actual payment on a go forward basis.

After his first stunt, I would never agree to watch the kid again. Also I would recommend looking at better living arrangements the moment you can.

No way. But, this can only get worse as the father's desire to be uninhibited will only grow. I mean all of us love our kids. But, being with them 24/7 isn't the joy in life that you see in a Hallmark movie. Its work. Its a labor of love, certainly. But, would we do it if it weren't our kid? C'mon.

It\u2019s truly NBD to watch her, in which case he should have no problem doing it himself, and needs to cut all these theatrics.\n3.

It took longer and it was way, way, way more fun. This guy sucks. You're NTA.", "NTA", "NTA at all. I have been in a similar situation. BIL needed babysitter for a few hours (him.and wife work opposite shifts but there was a few hour overlap between her leaving and him getting home). I agreed bc theybare my God kids and it wasn't that much of an imposition. I pretty much had free reign in the house (could eat/drink/cook whatever for myself, watch TV, allowed to discipline the kids etc). I knew money was tight so I simply asled.for a bit of help on gas (not even to.fully cover the gas I would use to get there and home) and bc we live in a legal state a gram.of wax a week. So essentially $40-50/wk to watch 2 kids for about 3 hours 5 days a week. Guess what happened first week? Guess what happened second week?\n\nAt the end of the second week I said unless I was given what I was owed by the end of the next day, there was not going to be a single day I helped in the 3rd week. My dumbass agreed to let BIL dash that last day to get the $ to get 2 gs of wax and to pay me. Guess what happened when he got home? \n\nAfter that I got hounded about how they don't have the money foe childcare, told them I didn't care. The kids will only become my responsibility if they both die, and being cheap ahs isn't the same as being dead. Anyways, week 3 passes. Hubby and I go to hang out, and I get handed 3gs of wax and like $100. Then I got asked about helping out again.\n\nSure! I said. For $16/hr (looked up average babysitting cost in my area, that was the low end for 2 kids) paid the day of every day. Everytime I have been asked since, that is my answer (except for a couple times when there was some legit emergencies). They stopped asking unless there was a legit emergency.\n\nIn the end, the lesson is: it doesn't matter your relationship to parents or kids. If you are not the parents you are under no obligation to \"help\" people that will only use you. You can 100% stand your ground and make them deal with their own responsibilities and sleep soundly at night for it. \n\nI love my God kids (they really are great kids, 4 and 8), I have a great relationship with them. I love my BIL (wife, well ex-wife is another story, even though she was completely on my side about all of this, she was the reason I ended up with the $ and wax I got) but that doesn't mean I can be used by people that won't compensate correctly (there were other issues of being used to that did factor into it but even if there weren't it wouldn't matter)\n\nOP these people are not even family, they are neighbors. Boo-hoo he has to do what so many parents do and take his kids along on errands...who knows maybe it wasn't errands he was running and it was just a single Erin, and that's why he was really upset.
