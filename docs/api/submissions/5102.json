He took advantage last time and its good that you nipped it in the bud. His wife agrees with you aswell so at least you have that backup. \n\nYou work nights, he knows this, but still thought being 6 hours late was acceptable.

Even if he got lunch and visited a shop or two for fun + business duties, that's a fairly long time to be gone. A full work shift to be exact.  An unreasonable period of time to be gone from child, and an unreasonable expectation of you to give that much of your sleep time.  Y'all need to sit down and discuss this...and make sure wife is aware how long he's steppin' out.", "NTA - he has to earn your trust again.", "NTA So he could do his errands with his child but it will be \"not do much fun\". I guess he can't. go out 8 hours like last time and really just do important errands. This is the life of a parent. You can't just toss your child on someone else with lying and do your thing.

Also he cut into your sleep schedule with this bullcrap and stayed out way longer than he promised to, without noticing or anything.

A few hours were a favor, anything past that point should have been properly compensated and sprinkled with some apologies and a good reason why it happened.  That man took advantage of the situation and his wife should have joined you in tearing him a new one.", "NTA. I am married and a 4 month old baby with a roommate who is my bestfriend. I sometimes ask her if she can look after my baby for a couple of hours to do some errands and when I do errands I usually try to finish it as soon as possible because she's not asking me to pay for it (currently on mat leave), usually it's always traffic where we live, if it's taking longer than I would like, I always update her.", "ESH -  He should have been much clearer about how long he was going to be, or updated you if he thought it was going to be a couple hours and ended up needed more time, so you could tell him to come back instead.\n\nBut also, if you live with the parents then you must also live with their daughter. It seems really weird to me that you wouldn't watch someone that you already live with and probably have some sort of relationship with. Also, I think it was a nice gesture that he brought home pizza. If you were expecting to actually get paid then you should have told him; he thought you were just doing him a favor and he tried to do something nice in return. \n\nIt also seems weird to now flat-out refuse after one issue, instead of talking it out. You could have compromised and said something like \"sure, I'll watch her for 2hrs, but I expect to get paid $X an hour after that\"", "He definitely intended to take the full 8 hours. He didn't want to take care of his child and was probably trying to time it to be back just before his wife got home. Now he figures it's been long enough that you forget and tried it again. That's miserable being exhausted and can't go to sleep. \n\nNTA", "One wonders what else he was doing during those \u2018Errands\u2019", "I had a 3rd shift job my last year of college one summer and it was awful.  I can\u2019t imagine having your sleep stolen like that!", "8 HOURS? He said a few and decided to stay away for almost a whole day in the eyes of the daughter. Like hell I would do it again? And for a fucking pizza? Hell no", "He works nightshifts! He shouldn't have to sit and watch their kid for 8 hours ffs! He needs his  sleep. And he was well within his rights to !refuse flat out. No his kid, not his problem.", "Everything about your comment is so wrong that it hurts to read it", "You said you work overnights and he left his child with you for 8 hours. I work 1 overnight shift a week and when I get home I just want to relax. As I go to bed anywhere between 4 - 6.  \n\nYou were more than kind to agree to 2 hours, but 8 is ridiculous and also left you little to sleep before having to be back to work. \n\nIf he's so desperate for you to babysit find out how much local babysitters make and tell him this is what I charge, if you don't want to pay me up front. Take it off my rent and get it writing. More likely than not he'll storm off pissed. But it serves him right. \n\nHonestly, I'd just say no and occasional babysitting is not in my lease. \n\nGood luck in finding something else......Maybe something with a longer commute, definitely a draw back but it could possibly be cheaper and child free. \n\nJust an FYI for people, I am in no way anti-child. I was a single mother and always had child care options just in case. That's part of being a parent. Something the husband doesn't seem to fully grasp.", "Haha yeah it's not great I pull a 5pm to 6am shift. Fortunately I nowadays have a quiet roommate who is on a similar schedule", "Even so, my bet is he will continue to ask and be hostile to you. She simply isn\u2019t around when he\u2019s pulling this shit", "The worst thing: that job actually was a swing shift summer job filling in for people on vacation\u2026"]}
