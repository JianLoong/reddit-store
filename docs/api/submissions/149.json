However, my SO has one request from me: to ask her family for her hand in marriage. I don't have a problem with that since I've always respected her family and I want to make her happy and to feel I took all the right steps for us to be together. However, that task has proven to be quite difficult.\n\nConstraints: My SO lives with her mother (divorced since SO was a baby) and with her maternal grandparents. GP, who is her male role model and a very important person in her life, has a serious medical condition that do not allow for me to visit him on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, because he is receiving medical treatment. Her mother works in retail and her schedule is somewhat unpredictable, and it has been proven to be difficult to schedule her days off with the Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nAttempt #1: Mid September, I asked for my SO to give me the schedule of MIL so I could take one of my limited days off to visit her family while SO was working, so I could ask for their permission to ask her to marry me. So, late in the morning on a Tuesday (11:30am), I called my MIL to inform her that I'd be visiting them in the afternoon so I could speak to her and GP about a special matter (I wanted to keep the topic a secret until I asked in person). She demanded that tell her what was the subject and I obliged. She proceeded to give me and excuse that Grandfather was not feeling well and such topic could set something off with his heart. I got quite upset and told my SO what happened. She blew up at MIL and, at the end of the day, told GP that I would have come for it, and he said that I should have come and that he'd have been happy for that. So, begrudgingly, I did SO a favour and postponed to a different date the request.\n\nPresent: So, I'm planning to visit them tomorrow since it's a holiday and it's a day that both MIL and GP are at home. However, SO told me that if GP doesn't feel well enough, that I won't be allowed to go for him to rest, which I agree completely regarding his age.\n\nBut here's the thing. I've been contacting to make the arrangements to give them this courtesy which, if it were up to me, I don't feel it's needed. We love each other and I don't think we would need permission for us to do what will make us extremely happy. But they (MIL & GP) never seem to be interested in making the arrangements or even trying to call me to visit them so we can have the talk.\n\nSo, WIBTA if, after this 2nd attempt fails for us to meet, I decide on no longer making an effort to give them this courtesy and simply propose to my SO?\n\nSorry for the long post.", "created_utc": 1667267276, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yivfst/wibta_if_i_no_longer_make_an_effort_to_ask_my_sos/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

GP said he\u2019d be happy to have you come over for that but MIL seems to have some hang up about it the way she keeps stalling. I would question why MIL has been so resistant. Do you have a good relationship with her family? \n\nRegardless, you\u2019re doing your best to do what your SO has asked but let\u2019s be real; your SO should also be sympathetic to the lengths you\u2019ve been going to do something she already knows is going to happen. If SO gets an attitude if you strike out again, she can do the proposing to you.", "You need your GF to help coordinate the meeting.\n\nAnd frankly, since it\u2019s not a surprise, maybe even take her.\n\nThis sounds important to her but it\u2019s logistically challenging.
