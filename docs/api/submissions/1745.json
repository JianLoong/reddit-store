I haven\u2019t really gotten a long with his sister (21F) and have since went NC with her in June of this year. I\u2019ve tried getting a long with her multiple times, even allowing her to stay at my apartment when she got kicked out of her dad\u2019s apartment, but something always happens that ends with us fighting. Like I said, I went NC with her in June and have no desire to be around her at all anymore. \n\nAnyway, its my birthday this Thursday and since I have Friday off for Veterans Day, I thought it\u2019d be nice to take a small trip somewhere to celebrate. My BF suggested going to his grandmothers house in Arizona since he wants to see her and she lives in a fun tourist-ish spot so there\u2019s stuff for us to do. We decided to leave on Thursday and come back Saturday. A couple days ago, his sister called and said she wanted to tag along as well. My BF said he knew I don\u2019t want to be around her but didn\u2019t feel like its right to say she couldn\u2019t go if we\u2019re staying at their grandmothers. \n\nThe past couple days have already been stressful with planning this trip with her. First, she only wants to pay $20 in gas even though its going to be at least $110 in gas without even accounting for traffic (the 91 and the 10 are hell on earth) and driving around places there. I just don\u2019t think its fair for her to barely pay anything for gas if we\u2019re also taking our own car. She also started complaining about my BF wanting to take me out for dinner on my birthday, saying something along the lines of \u201cthats not what the trips for\u201d. The worst thing is that my BF never says anything to her and tells me I should speak up if it bothers me. So I told my BF that I\u2019m not going to deal with this on my birthday and that they can go alone if they want to. I\u2019d much rather go on a trip anywhere else, like Yosemite or Mammoth or even Las Vegas, but settled for AZ just because my BF really wanted to see his grandmother since he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll get Thanksgiving off. Even if I don\u2019t go on a trip, I\u2019d rather just spend the day with people like my friends who make me feel welcomed, not people who make me feel like celebrating my birthday is an annoyance to them. \n\nNow he\u2019s saying he won\u2019t go if I won\u2019t go since it\u2019s my birthday but he still really wants to go to his grandmothers to see her. But I\u2019m not going to go if his sisters going. Now they\u2019re both mad since I\u2019m refusing to go on the trip. Even his brother, who\u2019s always been the more reasonable one, is saying to just suck it up because their grandmother really wants to see the two of them and that I can still have a fun trip if I just ignore his sister. Now I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m overreacting or not so AITA?", "created_utc": 1667844585, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yov4mr/aita_for_cancelling_a_trip_because_of_my_bfs/", "score": 274, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No more drama from her. She doesn't tell me shit. She decides to horn in on MY birthday trip and then has the nerve to tell me that it's not about my birthday...?  Tell them both that this is a no-go.

Not gonna happen.", "*Boyfriend...you and your sister committed to going to see your grandmother so that is exactly what you are going to do.  I am sorry that you feel like it is unfair that I am not going, but YOU invited your sister to tag along without consulting me and knowing full well that the two of us do not get along.  And not to be forgotten but this was MY birthday trip and instead of doing something I wanted to do, I agreed to go with you to see your grandmother.

Don't spend your birthday miserable.

It it is perfectly reasonable of you to say that you won\u2019t go and that they can go without you.

Happy birthday \ud83c\udf88", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s your birthday so go do something you want. \n\nGoing to see his grandma is FOR HIM. Not you. It\u2019s his way to see his grandma but claim to be a good lil boyfie who took you on vacation. \n\nHE needs to pull his sister back in line , it\u2019s not on you to speak up against her. That\u2019s HIS job. It\u2019s HIS family . He has to say \u201cno this is OPs birthday trip, maybe another time\u201d. \n\nHonestly, cut your losses. You\u2019ll always be last to his family. And he will always blame you for any discord and use you as a scape goat (oh we can\u2019t do that bc bad OP).", "NTA\n\n>Even his brother, who\u2019s always been the more reasonable one, is saying to just suck it up because their grandmother really wants to see the two of them and that I can still have a fun trip if I just ignore his sister.\n\nIgnore his sister? Pretty difficult when she's there.\n\nYour problem is not his sister. You have a boyfriend problem. When he decided to let his sister join you on a trip that was supposed to be for just you and him, he has shown that he doesn't respect you.\n\nThis trip was supposed to be for your birthday, but he made it all about visiting his family. Well, seeing his family anyways, sure, but you should at least get a birthday dinner, and a trip without his sister being around 24/7. And you're not even getting the birthday dinner. You're not even getting moments away from your sister-in-law. This trip is no longer about your birthday. This is no longer about you and your boyfriend. He hijacked it for family time. And now you are getting blamed for 'being difficult' when he is a total bastard.\n\nDump your boyfriend, skip the trip and have fun with friends. Don't just celebrate your birthday. Also celebrate breaking up with this dude.", "NTA.  He\u2019s right, that you should feel comfortable telling her your opinions, but if those opinions are shared he should suck it up and show a united front.  She\u2019s trying to mooch a trip.  He\u2019s TA for scheduling this around your birthday and not standing up for himself for wanting to take you to celebrate.  Tell them to go that weekend or another weekend if they want to see Grandma and he is happy accepting less than a third if the trip cost.  Go with your friends on your birthday trip.  You only get one life.  There are times to suck it up.  And there are times to assert yourself.  This is the latter.", "NTA why are you with him? He doesn't love you. His actions show who he cares about. Just cut ties and have a great birthday with people that actually give a damn.", "NTA. It's your birthday, they can have their trip to visit Gma, and you go somewhere else and have a blast for your birthday.  Too bad if he doesn't like it, you were already doing something you didn't really want to do, and then he says his sister can tag along, knowing full well you don't get along, on your birthday trip, and she's already complaining about you two spending alone time.  Nope, he needs to grow up and set boundaries with her, you don't need to deal with her at all.  You do not need to just suck it up.", "NTA- have a fun birthday!!", "NTA. your BF should have pointed out to his sister that the point of the trip is your birthday and that you have been nice enough to agree to go see his grandmother and allow her to tag along. \n\nHave a great birthday no matter what you chose to do but BF needs to remember what the trip was about in the first place."]}
