We fought a lot about it and in the end he stopped. \nHe said that it was because before I said he didn't appreciate me and it hurt him\nA few months after he added this other girl on Facebook, let's call her B, and I didnt like it, I had a weird feeling about it. I kept asking what they talked about and he just said he was asking her if she got home alright from a party. A few days ago and I found out he was messaging her and they were gonna meet up, they had a plan to meet up that morning. It was after a party and he was drunk. He didn't go through with it. \n\n3 months ago I met a super nice girl, C, \u00e0nd a week after we had a party at our place. He found her on fb and insta. I didnt like it and asked him why, he just said that he thought she was a good person  and that they didn't talk much. He told me that he couldn't live like this, that I'm crazy jealous and made me feel awful. I apologised  and spent 2 days trying to make up to him and him acting mad and hurt.\nWell... she sent me the screenshots and I was shocked with the conversation.\nI was ready to break up and leave but he promised he would change and I stayed.\n\nHe says he didn't want anything with these girls.. and many others where he was \"just texting\" and \"curious to know something\".\n\nThis week he met a girl, D, during a party. I had left already and she added him on fb saying she's writing something about bad work places. He did not add her back and says they didn't talk. \n\nSomehow in all of this i still feel like im the bad person. Like im preventing him from having friends. \n\nLast year I got a free trip and I couldn't go because he couldn't stay with our dog and I couldn't find anyone to stay with him.\nI've been working again for it and I got it. Now we just had a fight, I told him about it and he is very mad. His reasoning is I told him with only less than 2 weeks notice (i talked about the trip before tbh). But either way he told me to go. He clearly doesn't want me to go, should I go and jeopardise the relationship? Am I being selfish? I'm scared he will go back to talking to girls if i go but me not going last year hasn't stopped him anyway. I feel like I'm in the wrong for not accepting him talking to girls, which I know he shouldn't anyway but somehow I still feel Im wrong for wanting a trip. \n\nHe says he's mad because of the dog as well and yes they don't have the best relationship but it's only a 2 day trip. It's hard to talk to him, it feels like he looks down on me all the time when I try to have a conversation and we end up fighting. I love him, but I feel invisible. He stonewalls me a lot and when I brought up one of the girls he just blocked me.", "created_utc": 1667344140, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yjogam/aita_for_wanting_to_go_on_a_trip/", "score": 1, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s one thing to have friends of the opposite sex and another to spend hours texting them and making plans that don\u2019t include you or other friends around. The fact that he calls you controlling yet doesn\u2019t want you on this trip is a huge red flag.", "Your BF is weird lol. Why is he just talking to girls and random girls?
