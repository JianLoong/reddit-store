Your dad and his mistress have no integrity and the mistress sounds exhausting and cruel. She can't look at you because she knows what she did when she cheated with your father. He is just as culpable. No matter how many years pass she still acts like a dirty mistress. NTA and keep her out of those photos. Maybe don't make a big deal about it and it will be a nonissue.", "NTA! You do not have to have SM in photos. She needs to get over whatever wasp is up her butt! Of course you will look like your mom ( and dad)! They are your parents\u2026 SM needs to get over herself!", "I don't think you would be. It is your wedding so you do make the plans and invite who you would like to. But it sounds like your stepmom has had it in for you since the get-go. And also mentioning the fact that she was the affair lady that your dad got into an affair with while still with your mom, that's between him and your mom and the affair woman. But she really doesn't need to be there if she's going to downplay everything for you and your brother. If she demands a picture do just a picture with you and her and Dad so that she has something to brag about. That's all I would do. When my daughter got married, her in-laws playing the entire wedding and paid for it. This way her stepmom wouldn't have her two cents thrown in there for what she thought the bride would need and the bridal party to wear. And also for any other plants that were brought up. I participated in helping with the food prep flower arrangement prep and things like that. I also went when my daughter tried on some wedding dresses to find out what she liked and then her mother-in-law went out and bought the materials and made the dress for her. It was a perfect match to anything on the David's bridal racks. Her stepmom was worried about her two boys that weren't part of the wedding party and they were too young for some things and too old for the others. My ex and his wife had two little girls together and they were the flower girls, the youngest of their her stepmom's boys was the ring bear only because the nephew of the groom couldn't come to the wedding. Then when my son who is the full brother of the Bride got asked a week before the wedding to play an usher because the original usher was unable to be there she got mad. She also got mad when she had to sit four rows back from the front of the wedding because the way the city was set up. I didn't set it up the bride didn't set it up nobody but the pastor who was also the groom's father set it up. When wedding day came, I did my daughter's hair and makeup after she got into her dress helped her veil on. And then when I was escorted up to the pews in the front by the usher who happened to be my son, I was placed in the front Pew with my sister my kids Uncle who was just a very good friend of the family and myself. Then behind us were the grandparents from both sides of the family. And then the Pew behind them was supposed to be her stepmom and her two step brothers that were in the wedding party but the groom's side of the family moved all the way through the divided pews in the middle of the church so that pushed everybody back row. Stepmom was hardly upset about that too. The step mom has never really given my kids much of a relationship or tried to get to know them or even get on their level. I know she hated my son from the get-go because she tried to get him to be sent to me when she was expecting her two little girls with their dad. My daughter was on her list of having a girl to deal with until the new ones came. Then my daughter was taking advantage of made the babysit all the time. So I can understand where you're coming from with this because my kids had a similar style stepmom. The only thing was she wasn't the affair woman their dad stepped out with. She was wife number three I was wife number one.", "NTA,  here's a thought,  take lots of pics some with her, some without,  destroy the ones with her.", "NTA but a trick to put in your back pocket in case she magically appears for photos - make sure the photographer puts her on the end so she can be edited out easier", "Whistledick gets it!!

I don\u2019t foresee any drama with this wedding or its preparation at all!", "I dont think there is anything wrong with using people who are AHs. \n\nIts not like the dad is not aware of it. He probably wants to contribute because otherwise it is bad for his image. Anyone saying they hate their child, deserves to be used by them. At least they contribute with something.", "Having family photos and vacations where you are excluding some of your children is not really that cool.\n\nPlus her dad literally admitted to her straight up his wife doesn\u2019t like her bc she LOOKS like her mother. That\u2019s unhinged petty and childish behavior. Obviously for that to be revealed in family therapy one would have to assume there have been plenty of instances where OP has felt and seen the indifference her stepmother has for her and her brother.", "She wants to go to the destination, not the wedding.", "No way.  The woman has told OP\u2019s father how much she resents OP for a variety of reasons.  She has taken no interest in OP or her brother to the point of not welcoming them in home she shares with their father.

NTA at all. You have your dads approval for it, she sounds like a total witch, and you are a great stepsister to be so considerate. How old are the step-siblings? MAYBE if you want for their sake do one \u201cstep family\u201d photo with her, them, and your dad. You can burn the photo/never have it printed but then they won\u2019t notice she isn\u2019t in any photos as much? That\u2019s assuming they are young. If they are older I think you just say you aren\u2019t that close and so aren\u2019t doing photos with her. I would absolutely not have her in any photos you want framed/large group photos.

And just throw out the one with step mom", "If they mention it, just tell them that you know their mom doesn't like you or want to be around you, so you've told the photographer not to include her in photos so she isn't made uncomfortable.", "I'd take pictures with everyone and just wouldn't save any with stepmom for myself, but that's because I'm disinterested.  \n\nIf you despise your stepmom to the point of making a public statement,  then excluding her from pictures will make that clear. It really depends on you and the message you want to send - if you just don't think of her as family but don't have strong feelings, have pictures taken with her. If you hate her, don't. I think either is fair.", "That\u2019s just straight up toxic all round", "Agreed, but even if the stepmother is horrible this all goes back to the father.\n\nThe father is either controlling and manipulative, allowing someone to mistreat his children, or a bit of both.\n\nI wonder if the father has ever apologized for his part in all this.", "Grow a spine respectfully. This woman HATES you and your brother, your dad knows this and is still with her, she has excluded you from family photos/events, and you aren't welcomed into your father's home 90% of the time, she doesn't even know your fiance. Why is her behind deciding to attend your wedding and why would you allow it? Your half-brothers need to know the truth about their mom's hatred towards you because you look like your mother and how she's treated you horribly through exclusion. I wouldn't even feel comfortable accepting money from my father when he dropped the ball. The fact that he brought up her strong dislike for you in therapy is trash. I would have a serious conversation with my father and tell him that she is not welcome and to stay home, this isn't a family vacation for her. You then need to decide if you are taking your father's money or not and if you even want him to have a big/important role in your wedding. Your dad knows she hates you (his children) and still married her, so you can accept his money and let him know she isn't invited on the trip period.", "How about not taking the money and having pride enough to tell them both to shove it?", "Doing crappy things to crappy people doesn't have to be toxic. Its what law enforcement does every day - and thats a concept made by humans. But since the world is pretty much built on a web of hypocrisy,  l guess it could be considered toxic :P", "Yup you\u2019re right, father is kind of an AH here. \n\nAt some point her father became ok with the fact that he chose a woman to be with that doesn\u2019t even like his children, a literal extension of him.
