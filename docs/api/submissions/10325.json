I would definitely save all correspondence with her, just in case.\nChild support only convers the absolute bare minimum. They are also her children, and she needs to take/share some responsibility, which includes providing basic necessities like clothing.", "NTA, it\u2019s up to her to provide for the kids\u2019 needs during her parenting time.  The divorce decree and parenting plan probably even has language stating that each parent will do as much.  \n\nThat said, sometimes the cost of giving in is less than the cost of being right.  I would buy maybe one pair of shorts, three shirts, and a swimsuit for each kid, with the expectation that mom can wash the clothes mid-week (or not, rewearing dirty clothes for a few days on vacation never hurt a kid) and they\u2019ll need the clothes in a few months anyway.   Whether she brings the clothes back with the kids or keeps them for the summer is infuriating but irrelevant- you obviously have custody because she doesn\u2019t care enough to look out for their well-being and you do.  The clothes are theirs regardless and they\u2019ll get to use them whether with you or with their mom.  \n\nIn short - the $50 or $100 or so that you would spend is worth not putting the kids in the middle of this fight.", "Eh. \n\nESH. \n\nI don\u2019t think you need to buy a whole new wardrobe, but it\u2019s not like your kiddos won\u2019t wear the summery clothes once the weather warms up anyway, so I wouldn\u2019t consider it wasted? I\u2019d say a few pieces, if you know they\u2019re needed (bathing suit, maybe, maybe a few tops and bottoms for warmer weather) but if she wants to buy more, she\u2019s welcome to do so. \n\nSo I think I\u2019d suggest thinking about your kids\u2019 needs rather than the tit for tat going on with your ex. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t answer texts late at night.

She should be using her own money to provide that since the trip is a luxury, not a necessity and it\u2019s HER trip, not yours.

The dumb thing is, if that is the case, that would mean they are going to need summer clothes again soon for this year ANYWAYS, so op's argument makes no sense.

And it\u2019s her responsibility to make sure they have appropriate clothing to go on this trip. I will tell her next time she tries to use your kids as a way to guilt you into anything again you\u2019re gonna take her back to court and let them know that she\u2019s trying to alienate you from your children and it\u2019s disgusting and it\u2019s not gonna work.

If money is tight, ask for hand me downs in neighborhood fb groups buy slightly larger clothes that ur kids can also wear in the spring/summer. This is time consuming and unfair, but best for your kids. \nShe\u2019s being horrible, keep that correspondence to show a pattern. There\u2019s clearly a reason you have full custody.\nAs others have said, it\u2019s unlikely that none of last years summer/early fall clothing fit. Try to remain part of the solution, especially when she\u2019s being unreasonable. \nI\u2019m divorced and we coparent really well, neither one of us would argue about this. We\u2019d be glad the other was taking them away and be accommodating. Neither one of us would ever turn the kids against the other though- I would be very upset with that as well", "Each parent is expected to provide clothing for the children.  Child support doesn't cover everything. Mon should pay for the clothes as a part of what she is expected to do anyway."]}
