Your mother repeatedly criticizes both of you as parents which is harmful, not helpful. She got to raise her kids, now it's your turn. Maybe you wouldn't feel like you weren't doing enough if your mother wasn't there to repeatedly tell you you're doing it wrong.", "YTA. If you care more about your mom's feelings than your husband's, then you should go live with her so that her house isn't lonely. \n\nSounds like your husband is already doing all of the housework and childcare, so he'll be fine, and this way he doesn't also have to cater to two grown adults.", "YTA, listen to your husband he is right.\nMommy is not", "YTA, if this was the other way round and his mum was constantly criticising you as a new mum, you would want her out and every comment would agree to kicking her out.\n\nIt is a house you share, your mum has somewhere else she can go, if one of you don't agree to a guest them they don't stay.", "YTA\n\nYour mom needs to keep her opinions to herself", "INFO: What exactly does your mother do to help if your husband does most of the housework and childcare?

He sounds exhausted. He probably didn't expect to have to hold both a full-time job _and_ be the full-time caregiver to his kids _and_ his wife. Your mother sounds like she wants to help, but he probably doesn't think of her assistance as helpful, and if she's giving long-debunked advice about child-rearing, he's right to be upset if she won't take no for an answer.\n\nI'm going to posit that your husband is desperate for you to be an advocate for his needs, and you're presently not doing that. Instead, you're asking him to take on additional caregiving responsibilities and perform more emotional labor by demanding he give her terrible parenting ideas more weight than they deserve. Stop that.", "YTA, it sounds like your husband is working really hard and, even though you might have a good reason to not be able to do as much around the house, there is not a good reason to undermine your spouse and the parenting techniques you two agreed on in favor of your mom\u2019s ideas. Your spouse is your partner in this, not your mother. Two months is also a really long time to have someone \u201chelping out\u201d with the kid. I love my PILs, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d have wanted to live with them giving me advice in my own house for that long.", "Yta \n\nYou're mother has no right to make him uncomfortable in his own home and you have no right to unilaterally decide who stays in your home. Unless you're OK with him inviting whoever he wants to live in yalls home without running by you. \n\nIt sounds like you can't raise the child with help, how well will you fare if he divorces you? That's assuming he won't get custody, because this post is you admitting you're not a capable of being a parent.", "YTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t see it, but your mother is trying to drive a wedge between you and your husband. \n\nLetting an infant cry for an extended period of time is grossly unkind. It doesn\u2019t help babies sleep longer.\n\nWhile you are bedridden, your husband is the primary parent to your baby. You should not be siding with your mother when she goes against decisions you and he have already made.", "Your moms your mom but she shouldn\u2019t be giving any unsolicited advice. Maybe you should tell her that", "YTA. It\u2019s not your house alone, so you can\u2019t invite her to stay. Any guest or new resident must have both household owners\u2019 agreement. Your mother also sounds like a huge pain, and she definitely is interfering in your parenting in ways she should not. \n\nIf you value your marriage, get her out. Her alleged loneliness is not as important as your marriage and parenting. \n\nI suggest you talk to your doctor if you are feeling anxious and insecure about parenting. There are a lot of terrible postpartum hormonal things that could be impacting your judgement and emotional state that could be helped - PPA, PPD. Your mother\u2019s interference and criticism of your spouse will definitely not help with any of those.", "Sometimes you have to flip it and ask yourself if it would be ok for him to have his mom over for months while she tells him how you both need to parent your baby. If you\u2019re not well and he is doing the bulk of the parenting and chores you are not seeing all that he is seeing. Pretend it\u2019s his mother telling you how to do it all.", "YTA. Your husband has stepped up and taken on a lot for you because you needed him. Now it is your turn to step up and be there for him. Your mother is making this too difficult for him. You need to have his back and tell her to go home.", "YTA, don't throw your husband under the bus", "YTA  Your mom needs friends to not feel lonely. She needs to get out of your home before you allow her to ruin your marriage.", "YTA\n\nYou did side with your mom against him, because you and your husband made a decision together. Then suddenly, your mom disagrees, and you completely make that decision without your husband, the person you admit is doing most of the child care.\n\nThis child is yours and your husband's, not your mother's. It was nice she was there when you needed her, but it is too much and too long for your partner. \n\nIf your mom wants to stay, she needs to learn boundaries, and YOU need to put them in place. She does not get to override the decisions that you and your husband have made.", "YTA. \n\nCrying it out is scientifically proven to not work and you should have considered his feelings. If he is doing so much and balancing it all, then you should be very considerate of his feelings. It sounds like your husband is a real keeper.", "Yes YTA. Your husband gets no say in anything, you don\u2019t care how he feels, you are letting your mother be the parent.. it is not her child.", "YTA.", "YTA. You're allowing your mother to disrespect your husband.  It doesn't look like she contributes much to the household.", "YTA. Parenting decisions should be made by the parents. Do not allow your mother to strain your marriage. Her advice is not any more valuable than the choices you and your husband have made together. Her feeling lonely is not something you should be concerned with; she can find friends and hobbies outside her family. You will be feeling the consequences of elevating your mom over your spouse for years to come if you don't put a stop to this NOW.", "Yes, he DOES have the right to kick someone out of his home. Wth. Your mother has obviously worn out her welcome, and you need to stop imposing her on him.", "YTA. For one thing, this \"letting the baby cry itself to sleep\"-bullshit is absolute abuse. Your husband is right to be appalled by that. And for your mother to go against what you and he have decided together and managing to talk you into it as well is frankly beyond the pale. Maybe you would rather be living with your mother than your husband? Because that could very well be the result.", "YTA, that baby is 3 months old and cannot be spoiled. Please don't sleep train. Your mom disrespected you and your husband. He has every reason to want her out.  Next thing you know she will be feeding the baby solids because \"that's how she did it with you\" which could be dangerous.", "YTA. So your mom is second guessing your parenting techniques and methods you and your husband agreed on, you aren\u2019t doing much of anything (fine, valid reasons I presume, but still facts) , your husband works, does housework and childcare.  What, exactly,aside from causing problems, is your mom doing to HELP?  Your husband is probably exhausted and living with his mother in law sitting around criticizing him isn\u2019t going to help matters.", "YTA \n\nFirst of all the cry it out method has been proven to be really bad for your child. It\u2019s also proven you cannot over-love or dote too much on them. Cuddling, assurance and contact during their first years are vital to them and the relationships they will form later on in life. \n\nAnd your husband sounds like he is doing a great job supporting you and your baby. Can you imagine working then coming home to someone who is trying to tell you how to parent and that you\u2019re doing it wrong. This time is for you and him to figure out how to work together and be parents. You can\u2019t do that with your parent always around. While her help may have been nice in the beginning it\u2019s time for her to let you guys parent on your own. That\u2019s not saying she has to be gone forever but it\u2019s your husbands home too and he deserves to be comfortable and happy. \n\nTell mom that you\u2019re thankful for her help and that you can revisit her staying with you later on if BOTH of you agree on it. Imagine if your husband just kept his dad around all the time even though he criticized you as a new mom, he upset you and you asked you husband for him to leave and your husband just said no without taking your feelings into consideration. You guys are a team and are supposed to support each other. You\u2019re the foundation for your new family.", "YTA. Honestly, if I were your husband, I'd strongly consider packing up the baby and moving to a hotel until your mom is out of his house and warned she won't be allowed back if she utters even one more criticism.", "YTA. Your mother has overstayed her welcome, she is now not only interfering with parenting decisions, she is causing possibly irreparable damage to your relationship with your husband.  He has reached the end of his rope here, he is telling you clearly and you are ignoring him.  It is time for her to go.  If you cannot respect your husband and everything he is doing for you and your baby at the moment you should prepare yourself for the potential end of your marriage.", "Your mom is advocating for a child care method that has been shown to be traumatizing to children.  Cry it out so the parent can get more sleep is not okay.  Whether your mom stays or not, you will be an asshole if you take her advice.", "YTA 2 months is long enough. Time for mom to go or soon you will be living alone with just your mom cause your husband will be gone.  If your mom is lonely tell her to sell her house and move closer to you but not in your house. \nAnd it sounds like not only is your mom criticizing your husband but he is going everything for all of y\u2019all.  You need to show him that you are his wife and partner and get your mom out", "YTA. Your husband is doing most of the work and struggling and you\u2019re not even trying to meet him halfway. If your mom is gonna stay there, the least you could do is tell her to keep her opinions to herself so he doesn\u2019t feel judged. Instead you two are ganging up on him. He deserves better", "Yta, I can\u2019t fathom doing the cry out method when it is emotional trauma for the child. You need to do your research. Do not take anything your mom says without doing your own research. I doubt your mom has read any new parenting books. Otherwise she is going to continue to do things that are unsafe emotional and possibly physically to your child. \n\nYou need to be a team with your husband. Not your mom. You need to understand that your husband feelings about being a new parent and constantly feeling attach in his own home. Is more important than your mom being lonely. \n\nIm sorry but grow up and put your child and husband wellbeing first. I usually try to be nice but you need a reality check.", "YTA. If your husband is doing the majority of the house work & child care, how much help is your mom actually being? This is your husband\u2019s home, not your mother\u2019s, and 2 months is much too long to have a houseguest who doesn\u2019t get along with everyone who lives there.  On the sleep thing, I think your mom is right but that isn\u2019t the point. This is a decision that parents make, not others. Talk to your pediatrician & see what they think or if they can recommend parenting resources to you (books, online resources, parenting groups in your community, etc).", "YTA for letting your mom walk all over your husband and not defending him. He's going above and beyond and you need to recognize that. It's his house too. Your mom doesn't get a vote. Start appreciating your husband or you'll be a single mom and won't have to worry about taking your mom's side since you'll probably be living with her, then you'll be on the other end of her criticism and see how much you enjoy it.", "YTA-you have no idea what your mother is saying to your husband when you are out of earshot. She\u2019s also appears to be manipulating the \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone in an empty house\u201d thing to play on your emotion. Who benefits the most from strife between you and your husband?  It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s not your kid. And it\u2019s not your husband. \n\nShe\u2019s an adult who should have her own life outside of yours.", "YTA. Put that shoe on the other foot. You wouldn't like his Mom butting in and trying to tell you how to raise your child. And if he can't tell your family to leave when they make him uncomfortable in his own home then you don't get to. You just set the precedence for future issues. It's sad she's lonely. But you don't get to make that decision for everyone else to deal with her.", "You are prioritizing your mom over your husband. YTA.", "I need a lot more INFO. Your husband is either having an irrational hissy fit or a straw that broke the camel's back moment. \n\n1. How often is she criticizing him?\n2. How often are you siding with her about things that you and your husband already decided privately?\n3. What is her tone when she's criticizing? \n4. Can you honestly say that when her advice is turned down that it is 100% over and she respects your decision?\n5. What is her relationship with him like before?\n\nTo be frank, your husband is, as we say in my house (Inside Our reference), letting his Red Guy do the talking here and likely doesn't mean a lot of it. But you're also telling him he can't kick someone out of HIS house. So answer these honestly and I'll tell you how big of an asshole which of you is being.", "YTA. Husband is hanging on by a thread and you're concerned about your mom being a little lonely. She should get a hobby. You should get a nanny.", "YTA-So if he does most of the child care, housework, and works then what do you and mom do? You are the parents not mom. She\u2019s not understanding boundaries and she needs to go!\n\nYou also need to stop the excuses for your mom. If you can\u2019t handle life right now how will you handle being a single mom that has to work, take care of the kids, and do housework? Why aren\u2019t your siblings offering her to stay with them? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t respect their house.", "YTA\n\nIt's his home too. He's providing and doing majority of the childcare.  Yet you let your mother disrespect him and steamroll decisions regarding the child. \nYou're losing your husband, a man who honestly seems like a huge catch and many women would die to have as a partner.  When you finally lose him you'll have no one to blame but you and your mother.\nI sincerely hope someone talks so sense into you before you lose your family", "YTA. Would you let his mother come in and tell you that you were raising your child wrong? \n\nYour mother is overstepping. Your husband is stressed. You are sitting back and letting the tension build. You should have gently, but firmly, told your mother that she was overstepping. \n\nI understand you feel guilty but the solution is not to let your mother be your stand in. If you cannot be a physically present parent at the moment for health reasons and your husband can, then he needs to be supported in ways that help him. You need to focus on your health so you can become the parent you want to be.", "YTA, your mother has no right to criticize your husband or give unsolicited advice. She is making your home uncomfortable for your husband. Bye - bye mom.", "YTA", "YTA.  So your mother comes to help but also because she is lonely.  She gets between you and your husband by criticizing him in his own house, making his safe space where he should be most comfortable uncomfortable.  While he is living life working, cleaning, cooking, childcare, you lie there ill, unable to contribute.  Your mother tells him that he cannot kick her out of the house because he has no say in his house he solely pays for.  You could be supportive of him but instead choose your mom.  You can\u2019t even contribute that.  How much do you think he can take before he leaves you?  That baby may be the only thing keeping him there because I would have left already, taking baby with me because you are incapable and grandmother doesn\u2019t have legal rights.\n\nYour mother should be pleasant and helpful so that maybe your husband will want her to stay, which would solve her problem of loneliness but you have empowered her to think she is the boss of your house so now your husband will never agree to it.\n\nIs it that you feel guilty because your mom is doing the things you would be doing if not sick?  Is it you feel the need to baby your mom because her spouse is gone?  Whatever is pushing you to make these decisions, please re-examine them.  If your mom succeeds in this battle.

They left me. \n\nI've had that nightmare as long as I can remember. \n\nIt wasn't till I had a fabulous therapist as an adult who suggested asking my mother if they ever used the \"ferber\" method. Aka \"cry it out\" with check ins starting at 5 min but extending. \n\nAnd we finally found the source of my nightmares. From 18 months on that's how they put me to bed. \n\nThey didn't do it \"wrong\" but it was absolutely traumatizing with long term consequences. \n\nI don't blame them, that was a method many people used at the time. My little brother was born when I was 2. It made sense to get me to sleep on my own. But it was definitely traumatic. \n\nToday it's suggested to place a calm but awake child in the crib so they can learn to sleep on their own. But not ignore their cries for help. Love and physical affection is a need for a child. You don't have to answer every whimper but just letting them cry themselves back to sleep is neglectful IMO. Especially if they are fully crying. \n\nOps mom might mean well, but child psychology and developmental science has come a long way. Decisions are best left up to the modern parent in conjuction with their pediatrician. Just because her mom did it doesn't make it a good idea. \n\nOp and her husband made an agreement and Op is trying to change that based not on science, not on a doctors recommendation but on her Mom's opinion. \n\nMy husband and I agreed that physical discipline was not to be used with my children. We hears alot of flack for that choice. Especially from family. When my grandmother tried to say \"they needed a good smack and she'd be happy to do it\" I did not say ok. \n\nOp needs to grow up and let go of her mom's apron strings. Boundaries are important, even when you are getting help. \n\nAnd as a mom to three fully grown children, NO my opinion on anything doesn't matter. I keep it to myself unless asked.
