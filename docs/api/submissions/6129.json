My husband has been amazing and has been doing most of the childcare because I am still not in the best condition to take of our 3months old baby. My mother has been with us for about 2 months and has been tremendous help to us but sometime she criticizes the decision me and my husband makes which leaves my husband upset sometimes since he trying his best.\n\nMe and my husband had decided that we didn\u2019t want to let our child cry himself to sleep, we decided that we wanted to cradle him so he knew we would always be there for him. Yesterday my mother disagreed with this method and told us that she allowed me and my brothers cry themselves to sleep so they could have a more scheduled sleeping and it makes it easier for them to sleep for longer hours. I thought what she said made sense and told my husband that maybe we should go with that method. My husband got furious and told me that he done, he want her out of his house. My mom told him she not going to leave her daughters house and I told him he can\u2019t kick her out of our house. \n\nMy mom ended up leaving to bed, my husband told me he had it with my mom, that he works a full time job (which is home based) and does most of the childcare and house work with no help from me, that he has had with me being her sidekick and being criticized in his home. I told him she was giving us valid reason and she was helping us out so he not doing everything on his own. He said he would rather get a nanny to help out that my mom is making him mentally unwell and am not there for the most part. I told him that she my mom and am not kicking her out and he said it funny that I can make these decisions when am not contributing anything to this household and am barely functioning as a mother. That really hurt me because I have confided in him on how I don\u2019t feel like am doing enough and he has always reassured me. I feel like he trying to guilt me now. \n\nEdit - my mom has communicated with me on how she feels really lonely back in her house and she really like staying with us.\n\nAITA for not kicking out my mom", "created_utc": 1672514264, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1001fcr/aita_for_allowing_my_mother_to_stay_despite_my/", "score": 2326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mother repeatedly criticizes both of you as parents which is harmful, not helpful. She got to raise her kids, now it's your turn. Maybe you wouldn't feel like you weren't doing enough if your mother wasn't there to repeatedly tell you you're doing it wrong.", "YTA. If you care more about your mom's feelings than your husband's, then you should go live with her so that her house isn't lonely. \n\nSounds like your husband is already doing all of the housework and childcare, so he'll be fine, and this way he doesn't also have to cater to two grown adults.", "YTA, listen to your husband he is right.\nMommy is not", "YTA, if this was the other way round and his mum was constantly criticising you as a new mum, you would want her out and every comment would agree to kicking her out.\n\nIt is a house you share, your mum has somewhere else she can go, if one of you don't agree to a guest them they don't stay.", "YTA\n\nYour mom needs to keep her opinions to herself", "INFO: What exactly does your mother do to help if your husband does most of the housework and childcare?

He sounds exhausted. He probably didn't expect to have to hold both a full-time job _and_ be the full-time caregiver to his kids _and_ his wife. Your mother sounds like she wants to help, but he probably doesn't think of her assistance as helpful, and if she's giving long-debunked advice about child-rearing, he's right to be upset if she won't take no for an answer.\n\nI'm going to posit that your husband is desperate for you to be an advocate for his needs, and you're presently not doing that. Instead, you're asking him to take on additional caregiving responsibilities and perform more emotional labor by demanding he give her terrible parenting ideas more weight than they deserve. Stop that.", "YTA, it sounds like your husband is working really hard and, even though you might have a good reason to not be able to do as much around the house, there is not a good reason to undermine your spouse and the parenting techniques you two agreed on in favor of your mom\u2019s ideas. Your spouse is your partner in this, not your mother. Two months is also a really long time to have someone \u201chelping out\u201d with the kid. I love my PILs, but there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d have wanted to live with them giving me advice in my own house for that long.", "Yta \n\nYou're mother has no right to make him uncomfortable in his own home and you have no right to unilaterally decide who stays in your home. Unless you're OK with him inviting whoever he wants to live in yalls home without running by you. \n\nIt sounds like you can't raise the child with help, how well will you fare if he divorces you? That's assuming he won't get custody, because this post is you admitting you're not a capable of being a parent.", "YTA. \n\nYou can\u2019t see it, but your mother is trying to drive a wedge between you and your husband. \n\nLetting an infant cry for an extended period of time is grossly unkind. It doesn\u2019t help babies sleep longer.\n\nWhile you are bedridden, your husband is the primary parent to your baby. You should not be siding with your mother when she goes against decisions you and he have already made.", "Your moms your mom but she shouldn\u2019t be giving any unsolicited advice. Maybe you should tell her that", "YTA. It\u2019s not your house alone, so you can\u2019t invite her to stay. Any guest or new resident must have both household owners\u2019 agreement. Your mother also sounds like a huge pain, and she definitely is interfering in your parenting in ways she should not. \n\nIf you value your marriage, get her out. Her alleged loneliness is not as important as your marriage and parenting. \n\nI suggest you talk to your doctor if you are feeling anxious and insecure about parenting. There are a lot of terrible postpartum hormonal things that could be impacting your judgement and emotional state that could be helped - PPA, PPD. Your mother\u2019s interference and criticism of your spouse will definitely not help with any of those.", "Sometimes you have to flip it and ask yourself if it would be ok for him to have his mom over for months while she tells him how you both need to parent your baby.

Your husband has stepped up and taken on a lot for you because you needed him. Now it is your turn to step up and be there for him. Your mother is making this too difficult for him. You need to have his back and tell her to go home.", "YTA, don't throw your husband under the bus", "YTA  Your mom needs friends to not feel lonely. She needs to get out of your home before you allow her to ruin your marriage.", "YTA\n\nYou did side with your mom against him, because you and your husband made a decision together. Then suddenly, your mom disagrees, and you completely make that decision without your husband, the person you admit is doing most of the child care.\n\nThis child is yours and your husband's, not your mother's. It was nice she was there when you needed her, but it is too much and too long for your partner. \n\nIf your mom wants to stay, she needs to learn boundaries, and YOU need to put them in place. She does not get to override the decisions that you and your husband have made.", "YTA. \n\nCrying it out is scientifically proven to not work and you should have considered his feelings. If he is doing so much and balancing it all, then you should be very considerate of his feelings. It sounds like your husband is a real keeper.", "Yes YTA. Your husband gets no say in anything, you don\u2019t care how he feels, you are letting your mother be the parent.. it is not her child.", "YTA.", "YTA. You're allowing your mother to disrespect your husband.  It doesn't look like she contributes much to the household.", "YTA. Parenting decisions should be made by the parents. Do not allow your mother to strain your marriage. Her advice is not any more valuable than the choices you and your husband have made together. Her feeling lonely is not something you should be concerned with; she can find friends and hobbies outside her family. You will be feeling the consequences of elevating your mom over your spouse for years to come if you don't put a stop to this NOW.", "Yes, he DOES have the right to kick someone out of his home. Wth. Your mother has obviously worn out her welcome, and you need to stop imposing her on him.", "YTA. For one thing, this \"letting the baby cry itself to sleep\"-bullshit is absolute abuse. Your husband is right to be appalled by that. And for your mother to go against what you and he have decided together and managing to talk you into it as well is frankly beyond the pale. Maybe you would rather be living with your mother than your husband? Because that could very well be the result.", "YTA, that baby is 3 months old and cannot be spoiled. Please don't sleep train. Your mom disrespected you and your husband. He has every reason to want her out.  Next thing you know she will be feeding the baby solids because \"that's how she did it with you\" which could be dangerous.", "YTA. So your mom is second guessing your parenting techniques and methods you and your husband agreed on, you aren\u2019t doing much of anything (fine, valid reasons I presume, but still facts) , your husband works, does housework and childcare.  What, exactly,aside from causing problems, is your mom doing to HELP?  Your husband is probably exhausted and living with his mother in law sitting around criticizing him isn\u2019t going to help matters.", "YTA \n\nFirst of all the cry it out method has been proven to be really bad for your child. It\u2019s also proven you cannot over-love or dote too much on them. Cuddling, assurance and contact during their first years are vital to them and the relationships they will form later on in life. \n\nAnd your husband sounds like he is doing a great job supporting you and your baby. Can you imagine working then coming home to someone who is trying to tell you how to parent and that you\u2019re doing it wrong. This time is for you and him to figure out how to work together and be parents. You can\u2019t do that with your parent always around. While her help may have been nice in the beginning it\u2019s time for her to let you guys parent on your own. That\u2019s not saying she has to be gone forever but it\u2019s your husbands home too and he deserves to be comfortable and happy. \n\nTell mom that you\u2019re thankful for her help and that you can revisit her staying with you later on if BOTH of you agree on it. Imagine if your husband just kept his dad around all the time even though he criticized you as a new mom, he upset you and you asked you husband for him to leave and your husband just said no without taking your feelings into consideration. You guys are a team and are supposed to support each other. You\u2019re the foundation for your new family.", "YTA. Honestly, if I were your husband, I'd strongly consider packing up the baby and moving to a hotel until your mom is out of his house and warned she won't be allowed back if she utters even one more criticism.", "YTA. Your mother has overstayed her welcome, she is now not only interfering with parenting decisions, she is causing possibly irreparable damage to your relationship with your husband.  He has reached the end of his rope here, he is telling you clearly and you are ignoring him.  It is time for her to go.  If you cannot respect your husband and everything he is doing for you and your baby at the moment you should prepare yourself for the potential end of your marriage.", "Your mom is advocating for a child care method that has been shown to be traumatizing to children.  Cry it out so the parent can get more sleep is not okay.  Whether your mom stays or not, you will be an asshole if you take her advice.", "YTA 2 months is long enough. Time for mom to go or soon you will be living alone with just your mom cause your husband will be gone.  If your mom is lonely tell her to sell her house and move closer to you but not in your house. \nAnd it sounds like not only is your mom criticizing your husband but he is going everything for all of y\u2019all.  You need to show him that you are his wife and partner and get your mom out", "YTA. Your husband is doing most of the work and struggling and you\u2019re not even trying to meet him halfway. If your mom is gonna stay there, the least you could do is tell her to keep her opinions to herself so he doesn\u2019t feel judged. Instead you two are ganging up on him. He deserves better", "Yta, I can\u2019t fathom doing the cry out method when it is emotional trauma for the child. You need to do your research. Do not take anything your mom says without doing your own research. I doubt your mom has read any new parenting books. Otherwise she is going to continue to do things that are unsafe emotional and possibly physically to your child. \n\nYou need to be a team with your husband. Not your mom. You need to understand that your husband feelings about being a new parent and constantly feeling attach in his own home. Is more important than your mom being lonely. \n\nIm sorry but grow up and put your child and husband wellbeing first. I usually try to be nice but you need a reality check.", "YTA. If your husband is doing the majority of the house work & child care, how much help is your mom actually being? This is your husband\u2019s home, not your mother\u2019s, and 2 months is much too long to have a houseguest who doesn\u2019t get along with everyone who lives there.  On the sleep thing, I think your mom is right but that isn\u2019t the point. This is a decision that parents make, not others. Talk to your pediatrician & see what they think or if they can recommend parenting resources to you (books, online resources, parenting groups in your community, etc).", "YTA for letting your mom walk all over your husband and not defending him. He's going above and beyond and you need to recognize that. It's his house too. Your mom doesn't get a vote. Start appreciating your husband or you'll be a single mom and won't have to worry about taking your mom's side since you'll probably be living with her, then you'll be on the other end of her criticism and see how much you enjoy it.", "YTA-you have no idea what your mother is saying to your husband when you are out of earshot. She\u2019s also appears to be manipulating the \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alone in an empty house\u201d thing to play on your emotion. Who benefits the most from strife between you and your husband?  It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s not your kid. And it\u2019s not your husband. \n\nShe\u2019s an adult who should have her own life outside of yours.", "YTA. Put that shoe on the other foot. You wouldn't like his Mom butting in and trying to tell you how to raise your child. And if he can't tell your family to leave when they make him uncomfortable in his own home then you don't get to. You just set the precedence for future issues. It's sad she's lonely. But you don't get to make that decision for everyone else to deal with her.", "You are prioritizing your mom over your husband. YTA.", "I need a lot more INFO. Your husband is either having an irrational hissy fit or a straw that broke the camel's back moment. \n\n1. How often is she criticizing him?\n2. How often are you siding with her about things that you and your husband already decided privately?\n3. What is her tone when she's criticizing? \n4. Can you honestly say that when her advice is turned down that it is 100% over and she respects your decision?\n5. What is her relationship with him like before?\n\nTo be frank, your husband is, as we say in my house (Inside Our reference), letting his Red Guy do the talking here and likely doesn't mean a lot of it. But you're also telling him he can't kick someone out of HIS house. So answer these honestly and I'll tell you how big of an asshole which of you is being.", "YTA. Husband is hanging on by a thread and you're concerned about your mom being a little lonely. She should get a hobby. You should get a nanny.", "YTA-So if he does most of the child care, housework, and works then what do you and mom do? You are the parents not mom. She\u2019s not understanding boundaries and she needs to go!\n\nYou also need to stop the excuses for your mom. If you can\u2019t handle life right now how will you handle being a single mom that has to work, take care of the kids, and do housework? Why aren\u2019t your siblings offering her to stay with them? I\u2019m sure it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t respect their house.", "YTA\n\nIt's his home too. He's providing and doing majority of the childcare.  Yet you let your mother disrespect him and steamroll decisions regarding the child. \nYou're losing your husband, a man who honestly seems like a huge catch and many women would die to have as a partner.  When you finally lose him you'll have no one to blame but you and your mother.\nI sincerely hope someone talks so sense into you before you lose your family", "YTA. Would you let his mother come in and tell you that you were raising your child wrong? \n\nYour mother is overstepping. Your husband is stressed. You are sitting back and letting the tension build. You should have gently, but firmly, told your mother that she was overstepping. \n\nI understand you feel guilty but the solution is not to let your mother be your stand in. If you cannot be a physically present parent at the moment for health reasons and your husband can, then he needs to be supported in ways that help him. You need to focus on your health so you can become the parent you want to be.", "YTA, your mother has no right to criticize your husband or give unsolicited advice. She is making your home uncomfortable for your husband. Bye - bye mom.", "YTA", "YTA.  So your mother comes to help but also because she is lonely.  She gets between you and your husband by criticizing him in his own house, making his safe space where he should be most comfortable uncomfortable.  While he is living life working, cleaning, cooking, childcare, you lie there ill, unable to contribute.  Your mother tells him that he cannot kick her out of the house because he has no say in his house he solely pays for.  You could be supportive of him but instead choose your mom.  You can\u2019t even contribute that.  How much do you think he can take before he leaves you?  That baby may be the only thing keeping him there because I would have left already, taking baby with me because you are incapable and grandmother doesn\u2019t have legal rights.\n\nYour mother should be pleasant and helpful so that maybe your husband will want her to stay, which would solve her problem of loneliness but you have empowered her to think she is the boss of your house so now your husband will never agree to it.\n\nIs it that you feel guilty because your mom is doing the things you would be doing if not sick?  Is it you feel the need to baby your mom because her spouse is gone?  Whatever is pushing you to make these decisions, please re-examine them.  If your mom succeeds in this battle.

One example is sleep training.\nSleep training \u2014 colloquially, the \u201ccry it out\u201d technique \u2014 refers to any system where you leave the baby in his crib on his own at the start of the night, and sometimes let him fall back to sleep on his own if he wakes during the night. The name refers to the fact that if you do this, your baby will cry some. Pediatricians often recommend sleep training, and many parents do it.\n\nBut go on the internet, and you\u2019ll find many articles detailing the extensive long-term damage sleep training will do to your child. At its core, the concern from the opponents of \u201ccry it out\u201d is that your baby will feel abandoned and, as a result, struggle to form attachments to you, and ultimately to anyone else.\n\nThis idea comes, perhaps surprisingly, from 1980s Romania, where thousands of children lived in orphanages with very little human contact for months or even years. One of the things visitors noticed in these places was the eerie quiet. Babies didn\u2019t cry, because they knew no one would come. The argument is that \u201ccry it out\u201d does the same thing.\n\nThis is absurd. Sleep training methods do not leave the infant for months without any human contact, nor do they suggest subjecting children to the other types of physical and emotional abuse that occurred in those orphanages.\n\nTo learn about the impact of sleep training, we need to study it in the way it is actually used. Fortunately, many people have, and in a lot of those cases they used randomized trials.\n\nConsider an Australian study of 328 mothers whose 7-month-old babies were having problems sleeping. Approximately half were assigned to do a sleep-training regimen, and the others were not. In the short term, the authors found significant benefits: The intervention improved sleep for children and also lowered parental depression. But they didn\u2019t stop there.\nThey returned to evaluate the children a year later and five years later, when the children were 6. In this later follow-up, which included a subset of the original families, the researchers found no difference in any outcomes, including emotional stability and conduct behavior, stress, parent-child closeness, conflict or parent-child attachment. Basically, the kids who were sleep-trained looked exactly like those who were not.\n\nThese results are not an outlier. Review studies of sleep-training interventions do not find negative effects on infants. And many show sizable improvements in maternal depression and family functioning. Sleep affects mood, and parents who sleep less feel worse. The evidence paints a pretty pro-\u201ccry it out\u201d picture.\n\nNonetheless there are academic articles that argue against it. One small study that gets a lot of play shows that in the few days after sleep training, mothers are less stressed, but the same is not true of infants. The researchers interpret this as a signal that the mothers and children are losing emotional touch with each other, but this is a stretch. Why not interpret the evidence to say that cry-it-out relaxes parents without hurting children?\n\nFundamentally, the argument against sleep training is theoretical: that some children are devastated, even if those results don\u2019t show up in the data, or that the damage may not manifest until babies are adults.\n\nI think it is fair to say that it would be good to have more data. It\u2019s always good to have more data! However, the idea that this uncertainty should lead us to avoid sleep training is flawed. Among other things, you could easily argue the opposite: Maybe sleep training is very good for some kids \u2014 they really need the uninterrupted sleep \u2014 and there is a risk of damaging your child by not sleep training.\n\nDoes this mean you should definitely sleep train? Of course not \u2014 every family is different, and you may not want to let your baby cry. But if you do want to sleep train, you should not feel shame or discomfort about that decision.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/opinion/sunday/baby-breastfeeding-sleep-training.html", "There\u2019s some things parents know best (grandparents) and some they don\u2019t.

If you value your husband and marriage I suggest that you decide with your husband a date in the next week by which your mother will leave and tell her that you appreciate her help but you now need some time with just you and your husband. And stick with it. Your mother's behaviour, especially when hearing your husband quite reasonably wants his life back, is wildly inappropriate.  And YTA", "YTA. Your husband is probably over on r/JUSTNOMIL posting about this same scenario.", "YTA.  At this rate, you will be living with your mother but not your husband, with whom you will share custody of your children.  By your own account, your husband is doing a pretty good job of earning a living, paying the bills, looking after you and the children - and you are having your mother there (against his wishes) to harass him in his own home.  I would suggest you could be only days away from him seeing a divorce lawyer.\n\nTo help you understand, how would you feel if his mother was living with you and constantly undermined you and criticised your decisions, in your own home?\n\nBTW, having someone stay in your marital home is a \"2 Yes, 1 No\" decision: Both of you have to agree to someone staying in your home and only one of you can veto a guest's presence.  Especially in-laws.", "YTA- you should look up the psychological effects of the cry it out method on developing infants. Also your husband seems like he's doing most of the childcare and your mom helps occasionally, if she doesn't live crazy far away why does she need to stay with you? Why can't she go home for the night and come back the next day or when you know you'll need her", "YTA - you're taking a decision as a couple, and you back down when mummy says otherwise. You're not a child anymore. You're looking after your mom's feeling and you say your mom has been helping you. Question: who is taking care of your husband who is doing most of the work (on top of his job)?", "YTA. Kick your mom out or divorce your husband, give him a peace.", "YTA \"cry it out\" to a baby that young is abuse. What you're mother is proposing and what you're considering is abuse. If your mother raised you like that from that age, you were abused.\n\nYour husband is right.", "YTA. Don't create this dynamic in your marriage.", "YTA. Your husband should take the baby and leave you with you terrible controlling mother.", "still YTA. you either get to have your husband or your mommy in this situation. NOT both. Pick one.", "Mommy likes living with you and doesn\u2019t want to be alone? Then get used to only having mommy and your husband leaving you. No one will put up with an overbearing in-law.", "I am really close to my mom. Husband and I live in the in-law unit behind her house, and it's great.  She will probably occasionally stay with us for short periods when we have kids. Even I would not be able to stand having my mom live with us for 2 straight months! It's a miracle he has put up with this as long as he has. YTA.", "Piggybacking off the top comment. YTA. I\u2019m in a similar situation, only my MIL cannot afford to live on her own. I pay for everything, and at one time, she lived with us until we could afford another home. You cannot take her side against your husband, right or wrong. It will wreck your marriage. She should be commending him for working and still managing to do most of the childcare. I get that it\u2019s work from home, which is my own situation as well, but kids are a lot of responsibility. If my wife suddenly started siding with her mom over me, it would likely be the beginning of the end. There needs to be absolute loyalty in a marriage (excepting abuse and betrayal cases). You need to set boundaries in your home that she is not to talk to you or your husband like that, and ask your husband for forgiveness for battling him when she did.", "What makes you think she\u2019s not in contact with a physician about being bedridden?", "I would also make sure to define with her what \u2018offering\u2019 advise looks like. To the MIL offering advice might be just bleating out her opinion all over the place and then when told \u201cno thanks\u201d or \u201cthanks but I wasn\u2019t really looking for an opinion/advise\u201d she could get all huffy and say she was just \u2018offering\u2019 advice as she was told she could do. I would tell her that if she sees them actively struggle with something to say \u201cI know XYZ can be difficult/tricky/frustrating/hard/confusing, would you like my advise/opinion?\u201d, and then ONLY AFTER RECEIVING A YES, give the advice or opinion in a respectful and non-demeaning way, or she may also give advise or an opinion when specifically asked on a particular matter and only on that particular matter. I would also have a conversation about they also have no obligation to follow through with her advise or take on board her opinion if they feel it doesn\u2019t work for them for whatever reason, and that,that is in no offence to her, just that different things work for different people, parents, kids and families, and that whilst it may have worked a treat for her, it just doesn\u2019t do the same thing for them plus more research could have been done in the last 20-30+ years to say that that is no longer advisable and no explanation other than those is owed to her. The last thing boundary I would be putting in place around this topic is that she may give her advice/opinion (in the two agreed upon situations where here advice or opinion is welcomed in the first place) is that she may only give her advise or opinion ONCE! and she is not to harp on about and pressure/nag them to take or follow it after it is given unless specificity asked for a reminder, refresher, or clarification at a later date, and again not to keep on about it after that. \n\nAnd OP, YTA! Your husband deserves and has a right to happiness, support, encouragement, comfort and a mental health positive environment in his own home and you and your mum are actively depriving him of those rights. Also having house guests (even your parents) is a \u201ctwo yes, one no\u201d situation (meaning it only happens if you BOTH say \u2018yes\u2019, but if ONE of you says \u2018no\u2019, at ANY point, it either doesn\u2019t happen from the get go, or it ends as soon as ONE of the \u2018yes\u2019s\u2019 becomes a \u2018no\u2019) that may change at any time during the stay. Also similar with a parenting decision you have both previously agreed upon, both you you must be \u2018yes\u2019s\u2019 to revoke, alter or change that decision, if one of you is a \u2018no\u2019 you stick to original agreed upon decision, especially if what you are wanting to change it to is something that is no longer recommended and can actually be quite harmful, especially in that particular situation if you are wanting the baby to be moved to its own room  (as baby should be in you and hubby\u2019s room in their own bassinet or cot for the first six months for the best chance to prevent SIDS/cot death) to try something that is not recommended and can be quite harmful to begin with because then you are adding to big risk factors to not only your child\u2019s health and well-being, but also to their life.", "No need to wonder, we see the posts on a regular basis. The husband might have said some words out of anger but it might have been the truth.", "I doubt she's the type who would even shut her mouth if she did stay. I would have kicked her out, and if the wife doesn't want her to go, I'd kick them both out. He's already proven that he didn't need the wife, hire a nanny or a maid to help out, wife can recover at mother's house since she's so lonely.  \nThen the husband can decide in that time whether the wife is worth it or not.", "Also an RN and a mom to a 2 year old here. Your mom is dead wrong about crying it out. \n\nAnd your husband is the parent. She isn\u2019t. At the VERY least you should be standing by his side and then possibly discussing/researching later. \n\nEven if all her old methods are \u201cgood enough,\u201d why wouldn\u2019t you be shooting for what\u2019s best with todays research? \n\nHuge YTA in my opinion. Your husband married YOU. If you want that to stay fact kick mom out.", "All research that suggests serious bad effects compare caring parents to significant abandonment of the child. Then they end with vague conclusion that \"cry it out\" is bad, and people use it to claim that letting a child cry for a few minutes is bad.\n\nThere are no clear boundaries and it's situation dependent. Sometimes the child can sleep separately and the parent sleeps much better like this, which makes the parent more rested and better at caring.", "*citation needed", "I mean that\u2019s great that you were able to, but people are sometimes permanently disabled from pregnancy. It\u2019s actually really gross to act like she\u2019s just laying in bed for no reason. We have no evidence on which to base that assumption.", "I'm pretty thankful about my own mom realizing. My brothers and I slept on our stomachs, by the time I was a toddler my car seat was mom throwing her arm across me when she hit the brakes (fun fact, she did this to me in my late 30's too), and nothing was wrong with letting baby suck on an apple slice or dip a pacifier in juice. \n\nShe had no problem saying that times were so different and she felt like she has no idea how to raise a kid anymore, and very thankfully followed all of my safety rules.", "I have trauma from my parent letting my younger sister cry (rather, scream) it out. It was so many years ago and I can still see her there standing in her crib red-faced, screaming.", "Absolutely! \n\nAnd it has nothing to do with Op needing help. You can need physical help and still have boundaries and think for yourself. \n\nWhat gets me is that this topic was important enough for them as a couple that they communicated about it. They already made a decision together. \n\nI really think Op is allowing her guilt/grief over her physical limitations to make her question her validity as an independent woman and mother.", "Not at 3 months of age!", "Did it when my kiddo was around 9(? Ish?) months because she had never kicked the sleep regression (champ sleeper until six months and then ran off catnaps for three months straight, I was ready to leave her at the fire station tbh) - four days in she was going right to sleep. I still remember that first night of just climbing into my own bed and waking up 7 hours later. After the blind panic of why I'd been in bed so long subsided I realised I could hear her babbling to herself and laughing on the monitor and she was just waking up for the day herself. Those seven hours of sleep saved my entire brain \ud83d\ude02", "They are ganging up on him, whether she realizes it or not.", "This is a good point. OP and husband should be united. I understand the situation is pretty complex, and the mothers' help should also be appreciated. But for new parents, it is extremely important to establish firm boundaries. Doing that and enforcing those boundaries while at the same time relying on the own parents' help is difficult, but with proper communication it's doable.\n\nThe issue with OPs husband / mother about the sleep routine is clearly what makes me vote YTA though. Don't let your mother overrule your parental instinct with oldfashioned views and principles. There is plenty of sources that will explain exactly WHY it is bad to let a baby cry themselves to sleep. It's a horrible choice.   \nWill you get an easier sleep schedule out of it for yourself and husband? Sure. But the price is paid by your child, because you can and will permanently damage their mental health by doing so. They fall asleep at some point, not because they've seen sense,  but from simple exhaustion. A helpless, defenseless human baby of only a few months, that's left alone, crying, in the darkness, will take serious damage to his basic trust. It fears no less than dying when it's left alone without his caregivers. So yeah - you're husband is totally right.\n\nI have similar issues with my mom sometimes, where our methods don't align, and my son is 3 yrs old by now. But that's where you have to learn to stand up for yourself, for the childs' sake. If all explaining fails, I'll ultimately go by \"my child, my rules\" if I have to. But I'm sticking to more modern methods of raising children, convinced that I'm doing what's best for my child."]}
