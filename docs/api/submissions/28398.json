{"id": 28398, "submission_id": "171y1ri", "title": "AITA for making my mom sell her grandmother\u2019s wedding band because I needed the money?", "selftext": "So I (21F) have been living with my mom for the past year after leaving my abusive ex to save money. I\u2019ve been paying her rent and work full time. \n\nI\u2019ve been scraping together as much as I can but I don\u2019t make much money and had to sell most of my stuff. She was in the hospital for a long time after having a heart attack and so I had to start paying her bills and the full rent since she couldn\u2019t work anymore and had no savings. \n\nMy car was repossessed and I had to start ubering to and from work. I guess when they sold my car, they sold it for more than I owed and I got a letter in the mail saying so. They said I\u2019d be receiving a check for around $4,000. \n\nI waited by the mail everyday for this check which would help me tremendously. Well, months passed and I never received it. I called them several times and they said it was sent. \n\nMeanwhile, my mom had been recovering and I\u2019d been taking care of her basically full time as well as picking up extra hours at work and barely sleeping. She was able to start working again and receiving paychecks. I continued to help her pay bills and was racking up so much debt and make credit was tanked because of my car. \n\nWell, imaging my surprise when I call again and they told me the check had already been cashed. I confided this in my mom and told her I was going to take legal action and she admitted that it had come months back and she had forged my signature and  cashed it and spent it already. \n\nI was furious. I had been skipping meals while she spent my money on stupid things from QVC and buying herself nice meals  that she hid from me. \n\nShe justified it saying that she should have it because of what she\u2019s been through, and that she\u2019s my mother. \n\nI told her I wouldn\u2019t take legal action but she had 2 weeks to pay me back. Well, 2 weeks past and nothing. I told her I was going to start selling her stuff. One of the only very expensive things she owns is my great grandmother\u2019s wedding ring. I pressured her into selling it so that I wouldn\u2019t take legal action against her. \n\nMy family is saying I was cruel and she won\u2019t talk to me anymore because it meant a lot to her. She was really close with her grandmother, and it\u2019s the only thing she really had to remember her. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add I did some other stuff too that slipped my mind. I did punch a framed painting and broke the glass and damaged the painting that was pretty expensive and sentimental to her that she\u2019s had since I was little. I knew it was her favorite so I did that just to upset her. I know that was spiteful but I did it in a fit of rage. I just wanted to add that to maybe explain why she\u2019s so upset with me a bit more. She sold the ring for around $3k, and hasn\u2019t paid me the remainder which is about $1.2k but I let it go since I was just happy to get paid back any of the money.", "created_utc": 1696655569, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171y1ri/aita_for_making_my_mom_sell_her_grandmothers/", "score": 12, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also you didn\u2019t have to take Ubers you could take the bus. Yes it\u2019s inconvenient but it saves a ton of money. What your mom did was a crime and she needs to pay you the full amount of that check. I have no idea why your other family members even need to know about all of this but anyone who thinks you are cruel needs to be reminded that she committed check fraud", "This is super messy by NTA.\n\nWhat she did was incredibly shortsighged and selfish. Is she a shopaholic? Was the ring sold for enough money to help with the debts? I would never, ever trust her with finances again and try to move out as quickly as I can.", "Wow ESH. The edit just makes you a bigger asshole. What your mom did was wrong but that was a horrible choice to sell the ring of all things. Damn.", "The pathetic, shitposting trolls are really out in force tonight.", "NTA\n\nShe sold the ring and bought useless stuff from QVC and nice meals with it. Nuff said. \nIt's funny how thieves think that the people they steal from owe them, not only what they stole from them, but also sympathy for being a worthless person.", "When you transgress the basic social contract of _not-stealing_ it's more than generous to give them an option of not being arrested.\n\nI mean, she could of sold her ring which would sad but a reasonable thing to do, instead of stealing from her daughter that's been busting her back supporting her.\n\nPersonally, I'd be tempted to have her arrested anyway.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Point out that she could have been arrested on theft and fraud charges, would everyone prefer that?", "NTA!!! \nI\u2019m so sorry you have to deal with this, I think you should take the legal action and do what\u2019s right for you. Best of luck with the debts and all.", "Ngl when I read this title I thought to myself \"haha I really can't envision a situation where this would happen and you turn out nta.\"\n\nI was wrong, nta.", "ESH - surely your mother has other world possessions you can sell other than your grandmothers ring. And resale value of rings is terrible, if she paid 3 it's probably worth a grand max resale, which owes on it anyway. And can u even get her to sell it? I bet not, she seems like a narcissist and very ungrateful to payback care with theft.\nMove out and move on, when your family is blatantly stealing from you nothing left to save.", "INFO:  It was a wedding band, how much money could you have gotten for it ?", "NTA but you should have just gone ahead with the legal action.  What she did wasnt okay", "NTA, but only because the mom raised a child almost as bad as her. I really hope you find some way to address all your issues.", "NTA you need to move away from your mother", "INFO\n\nHow was your mom able to cash the check without showing a photo ID?", "No, NTA.\n\nYou moved back home, paid rent, and took care of her for free while she committed theft and fraud at your expense, stayed silent as you openly struggled, and spent all the cash on stupid frivolous shit on the basis of, \"I had it hard, and I'm your mother.\" She deserves a bit of spite directed at her if this is how she treats her daughter.\n\nFrankly I'd move out ASAP and leave her to fend for herself if this is how she treats you.", "NTA You paid all of her rent and bills while she was in the hospital and the thanks you got was her stealing 4 grand from you. I'd break a painting too.", "INFO: how did you know your mother was eating nice meals and buying QVC if she hid it from you and you had no indication at the time that she had your money", "NTA did she think you\u2019d forget about the check? I don\u2019t know what country you\u2019re in, but that\u2019s forgery and theft\u2026", "Idk where OP lives but if you live in a more rural area like I do, bus routes are basically nonexistent. Agree with the rest tho.", "Yes she\u2019s extremely bad with money and I don\u2019t trust her with it. She\u2019s the type to go to target and spend $1000 and start asking everyone else for money to buy unnecessary stuff. I\u2019d been checking the mailbox everyday because I suspected she might do this but she got it while I was at work.", "And she still owes me about $1k but I was happy to get anything from her at that point.", "seconded", "She got like $3,000 for it which I took and she hasn\u2019t paid the last $1k yet", "You'd be surprised sometimes if it was high quality gold.  The price of gold is a lot higher now than it was even a few years ago.", "I mean i assume you'd have been okay if she sold anything else to get the money,  is that correct?\n\nIf so you didn't force her to sell the band per se though you might have suggested that as an option.  \n\nShe's the one who didn't have other ways to get the money to cover her own theft in that case.  You didn't MAKE her do anything but try to pay you back"]}
