Since he started working there he mentioned some of his coworkers didn't have cars, and other coworkers would give them rides in exchange for money. \nSince he lived in a certain side of town, they asked him if he could give his coworker (F22) rides to and from work to help her out because Uber costs her average $30 per ride, and she's saving for a car. When he first told me this, I was okay with it, figured it would be ok to help her out a bit. \nThe extra commute makes him leave home an hour ealier than usual, and due to the far distance of his job+ having to drop off the coworker its an additional hour drive home afterwards. He's been doing this everyday since his 2nd week there.\n\nFast forward to now, I've started to become more uncomfortable with it. I'd like to think I'm not the jealous type, atleast not before this. About a week or so ago he came home wearing one of those bracelets that have a split pendant, like the type couples or best friends give to eachother. \nThe bracelet itself did not seem the \"romantic\" kind per say but it still raised a little red flag in my head. I said to him \"cool bracelet\" hoping he'd tell me how he got it or who gave it to him but he just shrugged it of and said \"oh yeah\" \nAfter much debate in my head I figured it wasn't a big deal and didn't comment any further.\n\nThere isn't much out of the ordinary except him getting home an hour later. \nYesterday he texted me he'd be home a bit late since he's taking said co-worker to pick up some medicine she needed. He said he  \"felt bad and wanted to help her\" \nThis raised another little red flag in my head. My husband hates driving, every time we're going somewhere and I ask him to drive he makes a face suggesting he doesn't want to, so I always end up driving everywhere.\nIf this is the case why would he go out of his way to drive her to get her medicine, let alone why does he go out of his way to drive her to and from work everyday if he hates driving so much? \n\nI could see me being the asshole if there's really nothing going on between them, but I really can't get it over my head why he needs to help her so much?", "created_utc": 1698363110, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h9x5i/wibta_if_i_asked_my_husband_to_stop_giving_his/", "score": 19, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This conversation seriously should have ended with, \"Sorry, I live nowhere near that person so I can't give her a ride\" (and it probably would have except he's lying about the whole story).", "\ud83d\ude25\n\nGiving someone a ride to work is not convenient if it's an hour out of your way to do so.  \nHow is she paying him? And yes, find out who has the other half of that bracelet.\n\nNTA. This is setting off alarm bells everywhere.", "Going out of his way by an hour each direction is highly suspicious. Even if it started innocently, it may be leading to more. It's been long enough for her to make other arrangements, either to get a car or find a coworker who lives closer to her. Talk to him and tell him that you'd like him to be home more and see where the conversation goes.", "As someone who has spent a lot of time commuting, I'm sorry to say that no one wants to add time to their commute to be nice. And adding 2 hours a day to their commute to give a coworker a ride to work is nuts. You give some a ride when you can pick them up on your way. \n\nYou're NTA - there are a lot of red flags here.", "NTA. Even if he isn't cheating his willingness to things for her or anyone else that he hesitates to do for you (driving long distances) is an issue and you have every right to question where his priorities lie there.", "So, this person took a job across town with no way to get there and back 5 days a week unless she used an Uber twice a day? What was her original plan? Because she had no way of knowing someone would be offering her rides each day, so she was planning to do what? Spend $60/day on Ubers? And if she had $300/week extra to pay for Ubers, wouldn\u2019t she have enough to make payments on a car? Generally speaking, a car payment would be below the $1200 she planned to spend on Ubers each month. \n\nSomething\u2019s not adding up here, OP. Between the bracelet and the two hours (or more) he spends driving this woman around 5 days a week, it sounds like he\u2019s having at least an emotional affair (if not a physical one), especially because he hates driving. \n\nWhy else would he be bending over backwards for a coworker? All very sus. \n\nYWNBTA for bringing this up. You need to bring it up, actually. His response will tell you all you need to know.", "That is highly inappropriate. They\u2019re spending literal hours together, running errands and small gifts are involved. They spend 8 hours working together, then time after work together. \n\nYWNBTA. Tell him to stop. What he\u2019s doing is over what a co-worker should be doing. Don\u2019t wait until actual lines are crossed, he is way to close to doing so now.", "NTA. These rides are adding TWO HOURS out of each day. That's pretty ridiculous. That's more than what one should donate to coworkers, and way more than anyone with a family (married) should willingly give up of their home life without a word.", "He's cheating on you.", "NTA but you should discuss it in a civil manner and not just demand he stop doing it. Personally there is zero chance I give someone a lift if it adds an hour to my commute, that's not living on the same side of town...", "It is always wise to listen to your gut instincts.YNTA.", "**NTA**   Your husband is showing signs of slipping into an inappropriately close relationship with this co-worker and your are justifiably concerned.   Get a copy of *Not Just Friends* by Shirley Glass.   You both need to read it right now and make it clear that you think your husband is skating on thin ice without realizing what he's been doing.", "NTA You're uncomfortable for a reason, and the husband isn't making it any easier with these little red flags popping up. And let's not forget, he's bending over backwards for her but can't be bothered to drive when you're around? Nah, that doesn't sit right.", "Nope, nope aaaand nope. Time to let hubby know you want your two hours back and bracelet girl has a week to either buy her car or find another way to work. Listen to your instinct on this. NTA.", "Info:  So do you actually know who gave him the bracelet?", "NAH. Picking up a coworker as a favor should add 15 minutes tops. What he's doing is unreasonable. But it's his choice. You should share your concerns though and talk about the impact on you/the relationship. Less quality time, you miss him, increases in household costs for gas and gar maintenance, etc. \n\nAlso, if you're uncomfortable about something, learn to communicate that. Don't say something passive like \"cool bracelet\" and expect to get the info you need. And then don't drop it when he doesn't elaborate. Ask him where he got it. If he says from her, ask why he felt it was appropriate to accept something like that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
