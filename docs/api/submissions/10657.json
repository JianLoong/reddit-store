Not at all. Not everyone wants to be a stay at home parent. That\u2019s what she wants. She really can\u2019t expect you to stay home, if she wants to stay home.", "NTA.\n\nYou are supporting HER choice. She should support YOUR choice.\n\nIf there were financial issues with taking care of the child things could get more complicated, but as stated, that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue here.", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s a delusional expectation for her to have. No one wants gap years in their resume without careful consideration, especially in the tech industry where everything is very fast paced.", "NTA - If she gets to choose for herself, so do you.", "NTA. It is your choice, just like it is hers to be a sahm. This is the problem right now. Your wife is pregnant and very emotional. So I would tell her that we can discuss this better when the time comes and not to stress about it rn. You still have 3 years to figure it out. Talk to her when she is less........pregnant? \n\nAbout your in-laws. Tell them to mind their own business, but in a nicer way. Something like: we are having a disagreement but I can assure you I love and care for my family and ME and your daughter (aloneeeee) will talk and resolve this matter.", "NTA. Being a working parent does NOT make you a bad parent. She clearly wants to have a fulltime parenting experience, and that\u2019s great that you can both make that happen, but it makes no sense to force either of you to do that if it\u2019s not what you want to do, especially when you have the resources for high-quality care regardless.", "NTA. Your response is entirely reasonable. You aren't saying she needs to stay home or get back to work, why should she presume she can do that to you?", "NTA. She is assuming that you can just drop and pick up a job whenever you want. Who knows if you will be able to get a job again when you decided to go back.", "Honestly, NTA. you have the resources for a sitter, and she knows that. If you wants to continue your career, like she seems to want to as well, neither of you are bad for wanting that. You\u2019ve never forced her into being a SAHM, it\u2019s something she comes to on her own, but for her to stay you should be a SAHD while she works and it\u2019s clearly against your wishes, that\u2019s wrong.", "NTA. You\u2019re supporting her desire to stay home for as long as she\u2019d like and also providing support for her to return to work whenever she wants. I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t need to take time off as well", "NTA. I don't think I'd want to be a SAHM even though I love my kid more than anything. \n\nTo actually resolve this, do you think she has concerns over how much time you spend at work? If so, would you be willing to cut back so you can have more family time?", "NTA\u2026 you provided very logical compromises. Sure you\u2019re prioritizing your career, but that also prioritizes baby and wife in the long run. You\u2019re both blessed to be able to consider the options of being SAH. Playing magical chairs with your employment status isn\u2019t the best idea\u2026 hopefully she can understand this with more time. Good luck OP!", "NTA. It's completely reasonable to want to keep working. Becoming a SAH-anything is a serious decision to make and can't just be dictated by one member of a relationship.", "NTA. She is making a choice for herself and you are making a choice for yourself. She's kind of TA for involving her parents in the discussion when it was none of their business.", "Nta, I would ask your wife how would she feel if you told her she had to be a sahm. That she had to put her career on pause regardless how she feels about it. All because you feel that is best. \n\nBeing a stay at home parent is hard and everyone who does it needs to make that choice otherwise it can cause resentment towards the other partner and possibly child. Its not for everyone and thats okay.", "NTA- she\u2019s attempting to make a life changing decision FOR you instead of consulting you, just fitting everything into a pretty picture- thing is, if it\u2019s not what you want too, it\u2019s only going to lead to resentment. \n\nInvolving her parents is ridiculous, she\u2019s doing this to pressure you into doing things her way, absolutely stand your ground.", "NTA. Maybe they missed the \"full time babysitter\" piece? \n\nYou have the ability to plan for your child having a NANNY! Do it.", "Yall's careers are different\n\nShe is an orthodontist.  Getting hired on at another practice would likely not be difficult after a 3 year gap\n\nThe same can likely not be said for a career in tech\n\nThis is how you approach this discussion with her\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nHer logic is flawed", "NTA\n\nShe's honestly being a bit unreasonable. After 2 years your child should start socializing anyway, and daycare is excellent for that. I have a 5 and 2 year old and the stuff they learned in preschool/daycare and the friends they made was worth it", "NTA\n\nShe doesn't get to just decide this for you.", "Transient mother here (i worked then I didnt, then I did, then I didn't ect while building my family)\n\nNTA\n\nLet her be angry and then hopefully she'll simmer down and you can have a conversation about this. Getting her parents involved is certainly an obnoxious thing to do that I cant really understand.\n\nIt's great that she wants to be a SAHM if thats really what she wants but thats not something that everyone wants to do. Being a SAHM parent is incredibly emotionally draining, and unlike working outside the house, you cant just 'leave' after your shift is over, because its NEVER over.\n\nThink about why you might not want to be a SAHP and leave the answer open ended like because who knows maybe you will change your mind after having said baby a year \\*shrugs\\* who knows, and maybe your wife wont actually want to go back to work after the 2 years. Again its all up in the air anyway, because things change as time goes on, so why double down now when you don't know how future you and wife will feel.", "NTA. If it's something you don't want to do then don't do it.", "NTA and your wife is the one being unreasonable and selfish. She may be thinking that in this day and age, why can't putting a career on hold for childcare be a \"burden\" shared equally by both parents. What a fantastic, progressive couple you will look like to the outside world if you did it her way. Since you are fortunate to have the means to hire a nanny to care for your child....counter her offer with this. NEITHER of you quit your job to care for the child. Hire a nanny after her leave is up and maybe she can cut back her working to 3 days per week.", "NTA. She may just be in a nesting phase and a bit emotionally charged about wanting a plan for a parent to be at home with her child as they're growing up. Her motive sounds sweet, but she's not being realistic about asking you to quit your job. Especially when you offered to let her be a SAHM for as long as she wants.", "NTA.  First of all, she expects you to give her the choice of being SAH, but refuses to extend the same consideration to you? She's the AH.\n\nSecondly, if you work in the tech field, taking a year or two off is a career killer, because the perception is that you aren't up on \"new tech\". Good luck getting another job at anywhere near the same salary you're making now. \n\nAnother option is to hire a nanny, and keep nanny cams around the house so you can each check up on a regular basis.", "NTA- you're allowed to have her preferences and she has hers. You're allowed to have input. It sounds like she's projecting some inherent beliefs she has about whether or not someone can be a good parent and have their career at the same time.\n\nMaybe she's afraid she'll end up doing the majority of the childcare- this might be an opportunity to discuss roles and how responsibilities will be split if you are still working", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't want to work in order to spend time with the baby, that's her right - but it's also your right to NOT want to do the same.  Also, the idea of being a Stay-at-Home parent is often more enticing than the reality of it\n\n  \nExample:  My brother was SO SURE he was going to be a SAHD to their kids......which lasted all of maybe six months before he was going stir crazy and said verbatim \"I need adult contact; I can't just sit with no-one but a baby to talk to all day, every day\".  I don't think he would have ever hurt his baby, but he was definitely taking a mental hit by staying at home 24/7.  He ended up going back to work and is much happier and mentally stable that way.", "whaaaaat? so she wants to force you to be a stay at home dad. no, you're NTA for not wanting to quit your job. you're being supportive of her choice to do so. You have done nothing wrong and don't owe an apology in any way shape or form.", "NTA\n\nYou can hire a full sitter. She's trying to use the fact that she wants one thing to demand another thing.\n\nThat's not how compromises work.", "NTA.  Having a child isn't cheap.  Someone has to work and taking time off can be detrimental to your career.  While she may be happy being a SAHM (which is commendable and some of the most important work one can do, even though it doesn't pay), that doesn't mean you feel equipped to do the same.  As long as you are supportive and do everything in your power to be a good, involved, and active parent, you are doing the best you can.", "Nta she has other motives at play here", "Wtf lol. NTA. How could you be selfish for not wanting to quit work? Everyone has a choice here. And not everyone wants to be a stay at home parent (it is A LOT). She should just do what\u2019s in her heart and move on.", "NTA sounds like she's projecting onto you. I don't think she wants to quit her job but at the same time feels she would be a bad mother if she didn't stay home at least a little while.", "NTA and she's going to have a really hard time re-entering the workforce after being a SAHM. She may have a nice degree but a large gap like that, especially for a woman, will reset your career. You won't be able to quit your job because realistically she probably won't be able to support you guys by herself in the beginning. \n\nShe's also not being considerate of what you want. Not everyone wants to be a stay at home parent. I'm a mom and while I love my kids, the years I was at home 24/7 with them were so isolating because I couldn't do anything as an adult and as my own person. It's just not for everyone and she's trying to force that on you. That's not ok.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It does not mean that either of you loves your child/family any more or less than the other. Unfortunately, her parents just hear THEIR baby girl feeling sad and are reacting to THAT, not the actual issue... explain to them that she can choose what she wants and you'll support her 100% on her choice, but that you expect to have the same choices and to be supported 100% too. It has absolutely nothing to do with losing career opportunities. \n Talk to your wife, though,  she may be having some prenatal anxiety about childcare/trustworthy people for your baby.

For the first couple years - sure, that's fine.\n\nBut after that? The kid needs to learn to socialize! They need to learn that mommy or daddy will not always be right there. \n\nI think it's much healthier for the kid to get out of the house and go to daycare for at least a few days a week. Do you really want their first experience around a diverse, larger group of kids to be at school?", "It seems she is feeling anxiety about leaving baby with stranger. This isn\u2019t a topic to decide right now. By the end of the year you two can reassess and decide what\u2019s the best way forward. Right now with hormones, anxiety and inexperience you would be arguing over a hypothetical situation. Her emotions and opinions will be different in a year from now. It seems she just needs reassurance from you. If I was you I would acknowledge it then promise to revisit this topic towards the end of the year and it will be a more informed decision than. But don\u2019t forget to acknowledge and reassure in the process. Trust me she is feeling overwhelmed right now.  \n\nNobody is the asshole here.", "NAH. But do you have the means and opportunity to take few months' leave to stay with the kid at some point? No one should be forced to or leaned on to be a stay at home parent, but it'd be good for your relationship with your child if you can and are willing to spend *some* time at home. Where I'm from it's actually encouraged that both parents use the parental leave and stay at home for at least few months (not both at the same time). Just think about it.

It comes across as your unwillingness to be a partner in the raising of family. I am not saying that's accurate - it just may be the place she's coming from.\n\nIt sounds like your wife is a pretty independent person - she does not seem to need you to support her financially. From experience, when you're pregnant, you feel very vulnerable. You are about to take on the responsibility of keeping a human alive and it can be terrifying. I would offer a bit of grace to your wife with her response to your preference to not be a SAHD. What might be better going forward, is telling her that it's something you might think about considering if the need ever arrived. She might decide she never wants to go back to work.

Since her parents weighed in on the situation, invite them to spend two years babysitting every day.  I bet they won't want to, especially if they're still working.

For men though, society doesn't handle it well.\n\nIf she want to be a SAHM for a while, great, but she should NOT expect you to do the same if you don't have that desire.
