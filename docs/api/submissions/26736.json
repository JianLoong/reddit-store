{"id": 26736, "submission_id": "16gzihy", "title": "AITA For not immediately driving to bail my stepdaughter out of jail", "selftext": "My wife (40F) has a 19-year-old daughter (Meg) that is starting her second year of college.  Meg attends a state school that is about a 4-hour drive from where we live.  She started classes about 2 weeks ago.  Meg has taken out loans to pay for her college and lives on campus so she has no rent and has access to food on campus.  She worked all summer so she has a fair amount of her own money, but we still provide her with $100/month to help her out.  \n\nThis past weekend, my wife got a call from Meg at 3am.  Every parents' worst nightmare because no call at that time is good news.  Thankfully, Meg was OK, but she had gotten arrested.  Apparently, she had been at a party with friends and gotten drunk.  She walked home with a group, but split off with a couple other friends at some point.  This smaller group walked up to what they thought was one of their houses, but it wasn't.  \n\nThe people who lived there did not appreciate the door bell ringing at 2am and called the police instead of opening the door.  When the cops showed up, Meg and the others ran.  Meg got caught and arrested.  She called us from jail and wanted us to come bail her out.  \n\nMy wife practically jumped out of bed and started to get ready.  I asked her WTF she was doing and she said we have to go get Meg right now.  I told her it's 3am and a 4-hour drive, if I'm going to be driving that far I need to get some more sleep first.  My wife ripped the blankets off the bed and told me we need to leave \"NOW!\"  \n\nI got up and reminded her that there are 2 other kids in the house (Stepson 16 and our son 9) that we need to talk to before we leave and I don't want to wake them up at 4am to tell them we're leaving.  I also reminded her that due to her astigmatism, I'm guessing she wants me to drive since it's dark out.  I told her she either lets me sleep until at least 7am, or she leaves now and drives herself.  I told her that Meg is safe even though she's probably scared and uncomfortable but that maybe she needs to feel that way right now.  \n\nShe tried to argue with me but I told her that I am not going to fight about this so she either leaves now or lets me sleep.  Thankfully, she let me get some sleep but woke me up right at 7am and told me to get in the car.  She apparently hadn't slept and had already told the other kids what happened and that we have to leave but would be back later that day.  \n\nThe entire drive my wife made comments about how scared Meg must be and how we should have left earlier, etc.  I kept trying to tell her that Meg will be fine even if she's a little shaken up by this.  Then, my wife told me that if this was my son instead of Meg, I would have jumped out of bed just like she did.  \n\nThat pissed me off because I would be doing the same for my son that I'm doing for Meg.  You get arrested at 3am and want us to bail you out, you're waiting until I'm damn well ready to come get you. But my wife thinks that me sleeping instead of leaving right away was an AH move.

And why\u2019d they run if they weren\u2019t doing anything wrong?", "nta!!!!! \nshe is 19, old enough to know better.\nif you're going to drink underage, you need to be light on your feet. \nshe will be Fine in custody.. she'll just feel like a sausage. \nwhich she is, because she called you at 3am arrested. \nMolly coddling her will do absolutely nothing positive for her. \nlife isn't fair, it doesn't play to rules, and mummy can't always make it better", "NTA. While it's understandable that your wife was panicking and upset about her daughter being in jail, it's also reasonable for you to want to be rested before making a long drive. Safety should always come first. It sounds like you did consider Meg's wellbeing by stating she was safe, even if she was uncomfortable. Getting arrested is a serious matter, and maybe it is a good life lesson for her about making better choices and understanding consequences. \n\nHowever, your wife's emotions were high, and it's natural for her to be protective and worried. Communication is crucial in these situations, and you both could benefit from discussing it calmly now that the situation has settled. But no, you weren't an AH for wanting to be safe and alert on the road, especially when Meg was not in immediate danger.", "I can see both sides. I can see myself jumping out of bed and reflexively getting dressed. But I can also see myself thinking it's okay for the kid to stew a while, while I finish getting my sleep. I just don't think I'd be able to get back to sleep after such a heart-pounding awakening!", "Reminds me of the story my Dad told me about a cousin once removed. Seems Dad's Uncle has a few  Grandchildren he doted upon. It was well known in town that Curtis doted over his grandchildren. So when Number 1 Grandson goes rogue one night stealing gas by siphoning out of a homeowners auto gastank and gets caught by the local police, they haul the bugger into the local jail. Police Chief gets a call that a juvenile has been picked up and per protocol the desk sergeant notifies the Police Chief at around 12:30 AM. The officer rattles off the juvenile's name and Police Chief recognizng Curtis' name tells, the desk sergeant to hold him while he calls my Dad's Uncle to come in and take him home.\n\nSo, Grandpa's, not Mommy and Daddy's phone, ringy-dingys at 1 AM. Chief of Police explains the situation and tells Grandpa if he will go down and pick him up, the matter can be cleared up by paying for the gas and avoid all the Imperial Entanglements.\n\nGrandpa's response, \"I don't have a grandson that steals gas, let the little bastard rot in jail.\" Ow!  Click-up!", "Well for starters, they won't let you bail your drunk kid out until they sober up.  - coming from a mom of a 2 time zero-tolerance offender \n\nThe best thing I ever did was let my kid sit in jail the second time.  Instead of bailing her out at 9am sharp, I let her sit there until afternoon.  After that experience, she decided she didn't want to ever go back and straightened up her act.", "Wanting to drive on enough sleep isn't \"being an asshole\".\n\nYou are also correct with regards to her needing to experience discomfort - that is the consequence of her own decision.\n\nThe your wife believes \"not being scared\" is more important than \"experiencing the consequences of criminal activity\" is unfortunate - it's a *much* deeper act of love to want your child to learn from their mistakes than it is to shield them from their mistakes.", "If your wife was worried why didn't she call a bail bondsman and secure her daughter's bail with a credit card given the late hour and you live four hours away?", "I\u2019m not going to call you the AH but if I were your wife I would feel the same way she does. That had to be an agonizing 3 hour wait.  Especially if this is the first time Meg has been in trouble.  If it were the 2nd or 3rd time, I would feel differently.", "Yeah I certainly don't think she did anything that falls outside of \"dumb college kid\" territory. And I think a written citation or warning would probably have been enough to scare her from the cops. \n\nThat said, hell yeah I wouldn't leave at 4am.", "Im confused about what warranted an arrest. She was drunk, accidentally rang the wrong doorbell. And then her drunk self ran when cops showed up? The Midwest sounds like a wasteland. CA cops would have just sent their Butts home since no crime was committed. Arresting her for all of that seems like such overkill.", "Obligatory \"I did not read all the replies\" but the last time I had to bail out a buddy many years ago there was a mandatory cooling off/sobering period for drunkards before they can be released. The arresting officer told me to not even try for 8 hours. That may no longer be a thing but keep it in mind for your next argument.", "INFO\n\nDid Meg know that you WOULD be coming to bail her out at some point, even if it was delayed?", "NTA.  If she was 14, I could understand, but she is facing the consequences of adult fun run amok.  She can sit for several hours and contemplate her mistake.  Your wife needs to gain some significant perspective and chill.", "NTA. It's part of the lesson. She's so concerned about getting her out asap but isn't talking a bit about *why* she is in jail. Underage drinking and running from the cops.", "NTA\n\nTired driving can be just as dangerous as drunk driving, especially for four hours on an unfamiliar route at night.", "NTA. Meg wouldn\u2019t even be able to bail out at 7am where I am. Your wife was overzealous instead of using critical thinking, & how awful of her to disregard your health and safety for a DRUNK PERSON. It was wise not to drive tired in the dark when the point was probably moot.", "AITA, yes,  For being a dick to your partner. Her daughter is in jail, scared, your partner is totally freaking out and you need your beauty sleep?", "NTA, it's just a difference of a few hours, not days. Yes it probably sucked for Meg but hopefully it gave more time for the lesson to sink in. You wouldn't be able to go bail her out if you crashed the car on the way there. I get your wife's sense of urgency as I'm a mom of a teen also, but perspective is important here; her and your safety were on the line since a four hour drive is more dangerous when driving tired.", "ESH - unpopular opinion but 19 is still young and a night in jail for something so foolish seems extreme and if you've seen a jail, you have no idea who else will be in there.", "NTA\n\nSafety first. And spending some time in holding after breaking the law can be character building.", "NTA. A 4 hour drive is not easy when you are tired. Plus maybe next time she will make better choices.", "My dad told us growing up that if we ever get arrested to plan on staying the night and he would post bail one time only. My brother tested it and found out he wasn\u2019t joking. He sat for three days waiting for an arraignment.", "The mother's reaction was correct. Being in a jail \u2014 for any length of time \u2014 is no joke. If it's someone you care about (assuming they're not a career criminal) you get them the hell out of there immediately.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to do something that causes her to get arrested, she can spend a few hours in timeout. She was safe, she had supervision, and it was safer for the two of you to wait. \n\nHer charge may have been a dumb one, but so is trying to get into a house that doesn't belong to you then running from the cops instead of explaining what happened.", "NTA, but I'd like to know what the charges are? Running?  Seems like LE out of control, as always.", "NTA Your stepdaughter got herself locked up by being drunk. Maybe if she sits in jail for a while, it will be an eye-opener. Your wife was wrong wanting to wake the other kids up at 3AM!!!", "nta \nActions have consequences. She chose to get drunk, act disorderly, and get arrested. I'd have left her for 24 hours to really get it through her head not to do that again. It's sad her mother can't see that by immediately jumping to go there won't do her any favors and she will never learn.", "NTA absolutely. Teaching children responsibility is good parenting. Not only that but there have been multiple instances of college students specifically getting shot after turning up drunk to the wrong house and scaring the occupants. Crazy", "Wasn\u2019t this a Modern Family episode?", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She got herself into the mess, and she can get herself out of it. She\u2019s an adult.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She was likely arrested for running and then kept for being drunk. I doubt she\u2019s in any serious trouble other than an MIP for being drunk. She can sit for a bit. And the fact your wife could say that you\u2019d help your son, the son you share with her is crazy. She sounds like she\u2019s projecting her own favoritism on you. She\u2019s willing to leave 2 underage children home alone to help an adult who should know better. She\u2019s the real asshole.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t have bailed her out at all. I\u2019ve told my kids that if they get arrested, I won\u2019t bail them out and their actions have consequences.", "What\u2019s that helicopter noise I keep hearing when I read this post?", "Sucks for her.  Consider it a learning process for her.  NTAH.", "It's called tough love. She made a mistake, now she has to deal with it. A parent shouldn't jump to the crying of their kid for anything more than that, she os safe and scared, thats it. \n\nShe will learn real quick her actions. \n\nNTA", "NTA.  You would have taken a lot longer than 4 hours to get there if you were in an accident.", "YTA. She got drunk and rang a doorbell. Do you even care about the kid? Like, honestly. If she did something bad, I'd understand making her wait, but that's a bullshit arrest. I'd bail out a cousin I'm not close to faster than that. The fact that you made your wife wait is unconscionable.", "NTA  \nAt 3AM, you might as well leave her there (given the long car ride) and wait for her to be taken to the district court for her arraignment. Depending on what she was charged with (I'm assuming it would have been her being drunk and under age and running from the cops), it's likely that it also wouldn't have been worth forking over the money to bail her out. \n\nMy mother always had a rule.... \"You get arrested, don't you dare call me to bail you out. Especially if it involves drinking.\" You were right. She was safe and there's no reason for both of you to drive all the way out there at that hour just to sit there and wait for her to see a judge. \n\nI'd vote that they (wife and step daughter) are ah's. Obvious why step daughter is... You don't get drunk and run from the cops. It just isn't usually going to end well. Wife is for demanding you jump out of bed and drive four hours to bail her out. She's especially in the wrong for \"ripping the blankets off the bed\" and insinuating that you'd treat your other children differently in the same situation with zero proof.", "NTA. My son knows if he ever gets arrested he would need to call his Nan in Ireland as she would get there before I would. \n\nWhat your wife needs to realise is your stepdaughter is not sick or in danger. But rushing to her half asleep driving would put you both in danger.", "YTA. She didn't do anything to deserve getting arrested. Jail is very dangerous for young women. You show absolutely no empathy for her. AND you made a creepy comment about what she was wearing.", "NTA I dont think either of you were way out of line, but a very light asshole to your wife for implying you dont care for your stepdaughter. Maybe you and your wife should talk about the situation once it's all over.\n\n You and your wife both had valid reactions to this. I've been in a similar situation with picking up family from the drunk tank hours away, and it's not a fun time for anybody. Your wife woke up to the news which probably put her in a state of panic, and your reaction wasn't what she wanted to hear. However, you know your limitations, and so your choice was for the best. \n\nComparing your dedication to your kids wasn't fair, but, again, she was in a panic and your reaction was to ask for sleep first. She felt hurt and lashed out, but hopefully you can forgive that.", "Omg apparently no person on reddit drank underage before,  yes YTA , your kid was in jail,  wake up and drive your scared wife to pick up your scared kid from jail.  My underage cousin was in the drunk tank and ended up with 4 broken ribs in a small town , you never know who's in the tank with them !! Could be another sorority girl could be someone out of their mind on coke with a bunch of cops who could care less about your well being.  Jesus,  everyone on their high horse about teaching her a lesson  why not teach her a lesson by explaining the terror your wife felt when she received the call. This doesn't sound like a pattern for her,  maybe show some compassion.", "NTA\n\nBeen arrested as a kid, wouldn't have expected you out the door at 4am to save me.", "NTA - Step daughter made the mistake and it's a teachable moment for her. She should suffer a little bit and staying locked up for a day or so is going to be helpful as long as she's not stuck with dangerous people. On a side note, it seems weird to me that you guys had to go there to get her out, what if instead of 4 hours away it was 12 hours away, or multiple flights? Was there no option to just pay the money over the phone? Admittedly I know nothing about how that system works as I've never been bailed out nor have I bailed anyone else out, but it sounds like a primitive system to me if that's the only option.", "NTA. I just dropped my son off at college for his freshman year. I wasn\u2019t fortunate enough to go to college the way he\u2019s going, so long story short I joined the military and got my degree via online. But I bring this up to say, as a mother, I already told my son that if he got himself put in jail, not to ask me to bail him out. Some adult activities come with adult consequences. I\u2019ve had young soldiers in my time and I\u2019ve been one. I know the amount of dumb stuff that just needs to be learned the hard way.", "Actually your wife needs a lesson on driving and life. Driving at night for 4 hours without enough sleep and turning back for another 4 hours can be very dangerous. Life doesn't give a shit on our priorities and doesn't say \"oh! You have an emergency, then you can drive sleepless without risk of accident\". NTA", "NTA, but I totally respect your wifes fear as well. If it were my daughter, I just might have slammed down an energy drink or two and gone right away. I don't trust cops, especially around young women. But still, you are NTA.", "NTA", "Oh good grief. They probably would have let her out when she sobered up, especially if it's a college town, with a ticket or misdemeanor court date. NTA", "The thing you missed:  Meg wasn\u2019t the scared one in this situation.", "Shit my kid would have sat for at least 24 hours.", "NTA.   My kid would sit in the can until morning too.  A little time to sit and think about how you got there won't hurt.\n\nEdit.  Why didn't she call her friends who got away instead?", "NTA, she got arrested for being drunk but she was safe where she was. It would be completely different story if she had been injured and was sitting in the hospital. She\u2019s 19 and made some bad decisions making her sit and think about it for a couple extra hours is not the worst thing in the world. It may actually prevent her from doing something that dumb again.", "Not the asshole.\nKids that get arrested need to learn a lesson if that means them sitting in jail for a while, or overnight so be it.\n\nDriving while sleepy's a lot more dangerous than that kid sitting in jail", "NTA Meg was fine. A few more hours didn't make a lot of difference.", "Yta. Women are at high risk of abuse when they're jailed or detained, even for short periods. You risked her physical and mental safety so you could take a nap.", "NTA - a few hours more in jail won't kill her, but it could teach her a lesson", "YTA   because I think you were arrogant and dismissive to your wife.   She was scared.  She has probably broken down in tears with worry.   Meg is working hard.  She isn't depending on the two of you for financial support.   Sure your wife had a right to think you'd not let your son sit in the drunk tank.  If you had a daughter who called you at 3:00 am from jail I don't think you would have let her sit in jail.   Daddy please come and get me I've been arrested and Daddy I'm so scared.  I'm sorry Daddy!!    I think your wife would have been up and ready to be at your side for a four hour drive to get your daughter from jail.\n\nShe'd made arrangements for the boys.   Had a pot of coffee brewing.   And she would have offered you support and comfort along the way.\n\nIt's about being a team.   This is going to cause problems in your marriage.   You made this about control.", "YTA. Meg went to a party and got drunk, which are completely acceptable things in American colleges even if illegal. She seemingly wasn\u2019t belligerent, but was mistaken in the location she was at. She\u2019s at a transitional period in her life, she\u2019s \u201cfriends\u201d with people she met two weeks ago. She\u2019s scared, probably feels some amount of shame, and barely did anything that would necessitate being arrested. \n\nYou are correct that she was physically safe, but think about how traumatizing it is for her to be in a new situation and be arrested and then not supported. Likewise, if you did that to your son I would think that you\u2019re an asshole. \n\nThat being said, if you felt like it was unsafe for you to drive that\u2019s a different thing. In this case it seems like you were saying you simply couldn\u2019t be bothered", "You are NOT the asshole. I mean this respectfully, but your wife seems to have been using her emotions to drive her decision making instead of logic.", "NTA you can\u2019t get her out until she gets bail determined.  Earliest would be 8:00. Realistic release time is 10:00.  Bail bondsman aren\u2019t open until 9:00.  You can\u2019t do anything for her until 9:00 earliest .  An extra hour will do her good.", "Nope. Your wife needs to understand that another adult's poor decisions (her daughter's) have consequences. That's what being an adult is.", "NTA\n\nGood job keeping a level head in the middle of the night, you are absolutely correct, she was in a safe place no harm was going to come to her.\n\nMaybe let your wife's adrenaline wear out and at some point in the future have a conversation with her, reassure her that if Meg was in any sort of danger that you would have reacted the same for all three children to rush to be there immediately.\n\nThis is not about whether you love her daughter or your son more or even differently, this was about evaluating the situation and making the correct decision. \n\nDriving four hours at 3:00 in the morning then turning around same day for another 4-hour drive home without proper rest is a recipe for disaster and quite frankly put the safety of your family and a much higher risk. There are horror stories about accidents when drivers are sleepy, both killing themselves and other innocent drivers on the road. Quite frankly I very much appreciate your level-headedness in the situation.\n\nWell done", "NTA\n\nMy parents told me if I ever got arrested to count on spending the night.", "No", "Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. \n\nYou are NTA. Kids an adult and needs to understand actions have consequences.

I have 3 kids, and they're far too young to end up in jail but if the time ever comes that I get a 3am phone call, I'm getting more sleep first. Even if they're just down the road, as you said, they're safe and maybe being scared and shaken is what they need in that moment.\n\nHowever, I can't blame your wife for wanting to go get her right away. It's her kid, and it's just instinct to take care of them.", "Your wife is unreasonable here. Helicopter and enabling. Yikes.", "Maybe if she had done a better job of raising her daughter she wouldn't be running around underage drunk in the middle of the night.", "Lol love how OP was so unfazed, had an argument and just went right on back to sleep.

Coming from someone who's been to jail, those couple hours are the difference between her leaving safely from holding or being assaulted in general pop because she doesn't know not to brush her teeth in the sink. Seen it happen plenty of times, the most dangerous time in jail is your first time in gen pop.", "YTA. If it were the second time you received this sort of call, or any number of times after that, I would agree with the desire to sleep in. It\u2019s a dumb mistake that she made but dang, spending the night in jail for ringing a doorbell is pretty over the top. Getting arrested is already way over the top for ringing a goddamn doorbell. It\u2019s dumb and inconsiderate but not arrestable!!! Trigger happy n t as up in this thread. \n\nSiding with the wife big time. This is gonna be a blow to your trust and relationship, over a measly few hours of sleep. I hope your wife can recoup that damage with her daughter. You\u2019re kindof a jerk for this one.", "YTA. Meg sounds like a good kid with her head on straight. She went to a party and got drunk,  Im guessing you did that at your age. Nothing wrong with that. They MISTAKENLY knocked on the wrong house.... and got arrested for running? If want her fault, she really didn't do anything bad. I don't trust cops, I don't trust the cells they would have placed her in, or the people around her. Geez.", "NTA. My guess is your wife has a pattern of shielding Meg from the consequences of her actions.", "NTA. Whatsoever. I get your wife was upset by the news and possibly unable to sleep after getting it, but she went wrong when she decided to take it out on you.", "YTA leaving your kid in jail longer than you have to is a shitty thing to do. She's 19 and got busted for underage drinking, the thing that everybody on earth does. She isn't becoming a criminal, she doesn't need to be left in jail to learn a lesson. Also you said she could wake you up at 7 and then when she wakes you up at 7 your like \"wow I can't believe she woke me up right at 7\"", "LMAO NTA I wouldn\u2019t have jumped out of bed for that at such an hour either.", "NTA - As far as her being scared in jail, she probably fell asleep/passed out. Years ago when I worked on a small framing (construction) crew, my boss called me around 3am from jail (drunk) asking me to hurry up and come bail him out. I did that but he was so passed out I had to wait hours before they could wake him enough to walk out.", "NTA. She was safe, and it was good thinking to make sure you made that trip safely.  If you had fallen asleep at the wheel, what would have happened then?  \n\nNo matter how you try to defend your actions, she is always going to paint it as if you didn't care about her daughter. Instead of fighting this battle, improve your relationship with your stepdaughter.  Make sure she knows you will always be there for her, but you also have to make sure you can get there safely.  Then get her a small gift.", "Nta", "NTA. But your wife is. An adult got arrested for breaking multiple laws. She can spent 12 hrs in jail. If my kiddo did that I\u2019d be sleeping in that morning and driving after I was well well well rested. Getting to spend the night in jail might just scare them straight.", "NTA- I wonder how old Meg was before her mom stopped wiping her ass for her?", "YTA/ I mean, do what you want, but if my son called me at 3am to be bailed out, no one would stop me from leaving the house immediately.", "YTA. I would have jumped up and driven 4 hours for the son of any of our neighbours, or for anyone in my extended family. For my (step)kid, I would have tried to break the sound barrier while doing it. Kids in the hands of cops are no joke.", "NAH. You, understandably, wanted Meg to learn a lesson. Your wife, understandably, was worried about Meg. Just two different takes on the same situation.

The idea that you wouldn't even communicate from your position of safety is wild to me.\n\nDoes your mailman or the JW ask for permission before getting on YOUR PROPERTY?\n\nPS they didn't criminally trespass according to US law.", "Any jurisdiction in the US, it\u2019s fine to walk up to a door and ring the bell, and it\u2019s not trespassing unless you hop a fence or you\u2019re told to leave and then don\u2019t. You can\u2019t be trespassing if you have permission to be on the land, and the existence of a doorbell and/or walkway is implied permission unless you have a good reason to think otherwise.", "[removed]", "[removed]", "[removed]", "It\u2019s the lack of remorse that makes it horrible the fact that it didn\u2019t just effect you but others.\n\nJust google what happens when you are arrested of campus I\u2019m sure you will be able to find them. But if you to lazy to it depends on what charges she gets. You know like if they had actually charged her for fleeing from the police. \n\nAnd no I\u2019m not saying he should have been arrested I\u2019m saying she put herself in danger. If you reread my first response I said she was most likely arrested because she ran from the cops, and underage drinking neither of those things have to do with Ralph as he did not do that. So let me re-alliterate it for you she put herself in danger in many ways. She is a young woman who was drunk and didn\u2019t know her way home. She could have had a worse outcome than the one she currently has. She should be thankful that her parents care enough to come bail her out. Because not all parents are like that. She should take this as a learning experience and hopefully get better at her balance in how to have fun. She is still learning and I hope she grows from this."]}
