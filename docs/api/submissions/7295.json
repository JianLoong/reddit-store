While it does sound like he's depressed its already been half a year, and he should have really sought help from a professional and be well on his way to healing, not keeping an underling hostage to his traumadumping (it may not be that he's looking to sexually harass her, but he may see her status as a woman as permission to use her as a therapist and that is still a form of him taking advantage). \n\nNTA, this guy should have sought proper help MONTHS ago and the only reason he's gotten away with treating his team like that is his high place in the totem pole. You need to talk to HR.", "NTA. While losing a parent is devastating, he shouldn't neglect responsibilities or trauma-dumping all over a colleague.  Since it's been over 6 months, I'd say you're well within your right to say something. Be kind and gentle, and speak to the facts (his work contributions and keeping a safe work environment) without being incendiary. Better yet, if you could loop in HR or the boss, that might be more appropriate. That's a tough spot you're in, OP. Best of luck", "NTA. Sure, everyone processes grief differently, and some people may need extra time and extra help.\n\nCoworkers, however, are not grief councilors", "NTA.\n\nWhat he is doing is highly inappropriate in the shirking his work duties and trauma dumping on your partner.  He definitely needs help and should be getting it professionally. \n\nIdeally, if/when you speak to him or your boss, please come from a place of concern when speaking about it.  Make sure you don't blame him and instead talk about how his actions make you feel.  All that stuff about I-statements does work.  It would be ideal if he could utilize services that are available through your work like mental health support through health insurance, other mental health benefits your work may offer, and maybe even the option of going on long term disability if his mental health condition is this debilitating.  Ultimately he is still grieving so a complaint that paints him in a bad light will only make it worse for him in the long run.", "NTA. I know we all grieve in our own way but it sounds like he may be taking advantage of the situation at times. Also work is a money thing and while it does help at times to have emotions at work, they need to get their priorities straight. Also Definitely watch out for them around your partner, they are moving on emotionally and headed straight for trouble.", "It sounds like he needs to step down from his position of leadership if he's no longer fit to lead or not able to fulfill the obligations of his job.\n\nYou didn't make any mention of him going to therapy to deal with this.\n\nThe fact he's roping your partner into the intimate details of his life is crossing a work line and if anything distracting from doing her job. This guy is very not fit for his role..... Do tell the boss or HR, Don't wait until the pot boils over. NTA", "NTA- While I sympathize with him and his grief, it is creating a problem at work. He definitely needs therapy, not a coworker but a professional who can help him with his grief. Since it's creating a difficult work environment, I say move forward with your concerns.", "NTA - I lost my dad 3 years ago to cancer. He had been in the hospital but was supposed to be released the following day. The call came and it blew me away, totally devastated me. So I understand what your coworker is going through. But not dealing and having it affect everyone around him? Not good\u2026 \nI had to take 2 weeks off to be able to work again. A friend also lost his dad and he needed a month. Everyone takes it differently, but half a year without improvement, I believe he needs counseling\u2026\nit\u2019s possible he doesn\u2019t see that he needs help, so try making him aware of what is going on. Some type of intervention. And if that doesn\u2019t help, then HR and boss need to be informed. Good luck \ud83c\udf40", "NTA: While everyone proceses grief differently, it is unreasonable to drag everyone down, and take liberties from others. While the situation overall sucks for this guy, he shouldn\u2019t be taking advantage of the employer, and he should seek out help. Furthermore, if he was grieving so much, he should talk to someone he knows well for help.", "NTA when I first read the title I had my mind made up I was going to call you the AH, but nope! Having lost my mom while she was relatively young 52 it took me awhile to grieve. However that being said work is work and you have to suit up and show up. Bad things happen to people daily and being an adult you need to deal appropriately.  Disclosing intimate details of his marriage to the only single female is highly inappropriate and HR should be made aware. Grief is difficult and I\u2019m not saying he should stop, but there is a time and place and work isn\u2019t that time or place.", "NTA. While losing someone is hard, taking over 6 months to mourn to the point it affects your whole life is a bit crazy. Get the guy in touch with a grief counselor because he clearly needs help to get past this. \n\nAs to it affecting work, you're 100% in the right to be pissed off by his actions.", "I think you and your gf (or perhaps your gf only since he feels comfortable with her) needs to confront him and tell him he needs to see a therapist.\n\nGrieving is normal. Some people take longer than others. But the things he's doing isn't healthy. He needs to be able to process his grief, which he isn't properly doing. If this continues on, it'll just get worse for him (and likely all the friendships he has such as with you and your gf).\n\nYour gf needs to tell him that their friendship is becoming unhealthy and he needs to see a professional to help him process. Be mindful of your words and don't say anything brash. He's grieving, he's not thinking right.\n\nSo you're question is if you're TA if being fed up about your coworker? No, of course not. NTA for being fed up, anyone can be tired and that's notmal. It's HOW you react to his grief and the words you choose that may make you TA.", "NTA. Talk to your boss about what's been going on and your concerns (not about your partner, but about the coworker's failure to do his job).", "The CEO needs to know there must be a (temporarly) replacement for this second in command. Your small team can't keep covering for his work. Don't you have like a businessdoctor of sorts /HR you and your girlfriend can talk to? This is not a healthy working environment any longer. Thhis healthworker can take it up the chain.", "Nta \n\nYour coworker Need a therapist.", "You aren't TA for wanting to talk to your boss / his boss about the issues at work. But it shifts if you bring your partner into it.\n\nIf she has an issue, let her deal with it.\n\nGo ahead and talk to your boss but keep it focused on the issues with work, because it sounds like you're only thinking of saying something out of jealousy.\n\nNTA (yet)", "NTA. Losing a parent is a terrible experience. Unfortunately, your grief and personal struggles do not excuse you from the rest of your life. \n\nThis person is expected to do certain tasks per their kob. If they cannot perform those tasks, for whatever reason, then they should be removed from the position. \n\nGrief does not give you a pass to be inappropriate with coworkers. If he needs therapy (he does), he should see a licensed therapist. The kinds of conversations he's having, whatever his motives, are highly inappropriate. He should know that, especially given his place in the company.\n\nThis person is adding no value to the team and is negatively affecting morale. He is failing to execute his tasks, potentially falsifying his working hours, and behaving in a manner that is entirely inappropriate. HR needs to be involved and take appropriate action.", "NTA, if this guy is still such a wreck after 6 months then he is in need of some serious grief counseling because for some reason he is not recovering normally. I would definitely voice some concerns to HR about his mental well being and see if they can call the guy in and talk to him about getting help and transferring some of his duties to others until he recovers so you don't have to work around him not signing off on things that he has to sign off on.", "NTA. If he's essentially the #2 to the CEO, somebody needs to talk to the CEO or COO (if you have one), and say \"Bob is essentially not functioning. First, he needs therapy/counseling to help get back on track. Second, we need a plan to make sure Bob's job is getting done until he's firing on all 8 again.\"", "NAH.   Tricky.   I am not going to say grieving co-worker is AH because clearly they need professional help to deal with their grief.  Posting on facebook all day long and oversharing with work colleagues isn't working at all.  There is no mention here if they are seeing a psychiatrist or similar; if they aren't they need to start ASAP.    You certainly are not AH for being justifiably concerned about your company and the impact this is having on staff.   The CEO (who hopefully is well aware of what is going on) may need to start earning their salary and make some very tough decisions.", "Look you can be annoyed but you need to understand that people deal with grief in different ways it's a difficult thing especially when it's a parent", "YTA\n\nBut not a bad person. Losing a parent can be destabilizing for people. I know people who haven't got beyond it, years down the road. It's a very difficult loss. \n\nHere's the thing. Apart from how it affects your work, it's not really your place to complain to him or his boss. If your partner has an issue with his sharing, it's her place to handle it. Of course be supportive if she decides to. But don't badger her.

I once had a woman do that to me at work, and it made me so incredibly uncomfortable that I actively avoided her (think hiding around corners and checking through doorways) for the rest of the time I worked there.

It sounds like this is a very sincere mental breakdown on the coworker\u2019s part, so I don\u2019t necessarily think they\u2019re an asshole either. Yet you are dealing with the collateral damage. This is a really tough one.", "NTA I agree with going to HR.  He's really inserting his personal life onto not just your wife but a co worker.  Use the golfing as a ladt resort.  I'm currently on fmla from a herniated disc surgery.  My husband and I went out to dinner last night.  We were tactful enough to not post on social media because his job know he's on fmla for two weeks.  Can I not enjoy a meal while on fmla?
