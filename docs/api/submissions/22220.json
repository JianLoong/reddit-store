My bride-to-be's bridal shower is on Sunday. Naturally, there is a lot to be done about this, as it's being hosted at my parents' house in their backyard, where I live. My bride and I live with our parents until we move in together after the wedding.  \n\nThe majority of the tables, chairs, kitchenware, dishes, etc. are all set up. People have their dresses and have RSVPed. Everyone who is attending knows when to be at my parents' house and where it is. The tent was built yesterday by a rental company, which I help direct. My bride and her mother are preparing food and things today and tomorrow, as is my mom. I have made it very clear with my bride that I will help how I can, whenever I can. I believe I've been accommodating and helpful and promise to continue to do so.  \n\nAs a hobby, I do creative writing, and had planned on doing it today. I understood that I will likely need to help out today, but my bride said it was okay to take some time to myself to do creative writing.  \n\nThis morning as I was brushing my teeth, my mom came over to the bathroom and told me she had a dentist appointment today and would be busy all day getting ready for the bridal shower. I chuckled at the coincidence and said that I have a dentist appointment, too, today. My mom asked me if I was going to do creative writing at the library today, to which I said I would be for a little bit, and I could help her afterwards.  \n\nShe stated she had a lot to do today, and asked me if I could not do any creative writing today. Which, I clearly and firmly responded that no, I planned out doing something for me today, and that was important. That the bridal shower was not for me at all, and I wanted to give myself some time to myself before I helped out, but still would.  \n\nMy Mom scoffed at my response, which I got upset over, and said, \"Why are you having a reaction to me wanting to do something for myself?\" She responded \"How she wanted to do things for herself too, today, but that we all have responsibilities to uphold.\" I repeated how, \"I'm doing this for me today.\"  \n\nShe scoffed again and stated that \"In a marriage, things for the other person are things for you, and how could I say this isn't for me when it's for my fianc\u00e9e?\" To which I said, \"Mom, you can do things for yourself today, too, no one said you can't. I encourage you to do so.\" She stormed away, where I stated, \"You did not like my response, and I'm sorry, but you chose to have the bridal shower at the house. We didn't need to have it here if it was too much stress. You offered to help. I will help set up more, but I'm taking time for me today.\"  \n\nWhich my mom responded through half-strained eyes, \"And then this will be the last time I offer to help.\" Which I once again stated, \"You didn't like my response and you chose to react this way.\" She finally said, \"I'd like to stop talking.\"  \n\nAm I the asshole for firmly stating I wanted part of the day for myself and that the bridal shower wasn't for me?  \n\nEdit: Here is more info:  \n\nI planned on spending all day tomorrow assisting in the cooking process in whatever form that takes, decorating the tent, and making the house even tidier than it already was going to be. Today, a professional cleaner was coming by and to deep clean the house, which I was going to neaten up  before my dentist appointment.  \n\nEdit #2: I was going to spend 60 minutes to 90 minutes maximum writing today.  \n\nEdit #3: She wanted me to move a few boxes out of the cleaners way so they can clean, which she only told me after the fight via text, which I have already accomplished as of the moment of writing this comment.  \n\nThe only thing going on is the cleaners today. She wanted no one in the house while the cleaners came, which we are all accomplishing. She didn't tell me about moving any boxes until today, which I gladly would have done yesterday.  \n\nMy mother likes to entertain and the house is already in great condition. I never asked her to have the house deep cleaned.  \n\nEdit #4:  I should have been better and really need to be better. I'm rather sensitive about my writing time, as it's the only thing that I feel I get as alone time.   \n\nI have a lot of deep-seated stress with my mom that goes back a long time. This is just one of many moments where she has tried to control the wedding, my life, my career, etc. I would probably read the author of this as young, as well. She, unfortunately, comes up a lot in my therapy, and, sadly, always seems too busy to attend sessions with me together. I'm not the only person she's fought with over the years, including my father, brother, sisters, aunt, etc. Thank you all for your judgments.", "created_utc": 1689342449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zgxio/aita_for_firmly_stating_im_taking_time_for_myself/", "score": 10, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think the main issue is your attitude toward the shower. She\u2019s probably super excited about it and anxious about setting up, and would love if you could help. Anything she receives gift wise will be yours too. So it is partially about you as well.", "The gifts are for both of us, yes, and frankly ... in the heat of the moment, I probably poorly stated that.  \n\nI made a 3rd edit, if you haven't seen yet, in order to help your judgment.", "I'm not sure why other than if you're judging my post based on my age?", "Thanks for the honesty, friend.

Thanks for the judgment and keeping me in check.  \n\nAs explained in my 4th edit (this is context, not as excuse), but I have a very strained relationship with my Mom. She and I both have OCD. She's undiagnosed and refuses to get a diagnosis. Frankly, my mom is both trying to foster a relationship with the two families, and also control things as she has throughout the wedding process.  \n\nI've had to talk to my mom at least 6 times that she's overstepping and telling my bride what should be done.

At best I'd describe your tone throughout as \"childish and stubborn\" . . . at worst, just plain immature. \n\nHonestly, if you hadn't said below that you're nearly 30, I would have guessed that you were about a decade younger.", "The whole point of this sub is to judge. Why won\u2019t you divulge ages?", "Okay, so why can\u2019t you work with your mom instead of laying down lines?  Ask her what she needs help with today and figure out a plan for when you will get it done that also allows you some writing time.  Not everything needs to a battle and demarcating territory.", "I honestly don't know. Apparently, the decorations are happening tomorrow. I'm in the process of tidying up the house before the deep cleaners come to clean the entire home.", "That still doesn\u2019t tell me what your mom wanted you to do. \n\nDid she want you in the home when the cleaners come since that\u2019s the only thing going on today? \n\nI\u2019m assuming she scheduled her dentist around that appt, since she was the one who scheduled the cleaners, so she was planning on being in the house anyway. \nOr does she want you to be there but didn\u2019t bother to tell you until today? \n\nHonestly tho, deep cleaning the house before a party is a waste. \nThe party is in the yard so the only time ppl will be in the house is to use the bathroom really.", "All this time you're spending reading and writing on this thread could be used for your writing or doing whatever your mom requested. Not to be rude, seriously,", "After reading some of that, stand by the NAH/NTA. I still wouldn't say your mom is an AH. She probably just wants everything to be perfect, and you stepping out bothers her. I will follow up with the \"not my party\" thing as borderline YTA, but moreso if you had a complete hands-off approach.\n\nIt seems mostly everything is managed, and you're not stepping out for an entire day, or absent the day/morning of (where tying up the loose ends up is most crucial).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I just read this event isn't even tomorrow, its Sunday.

That\u2019s all that really matters.  \n\nNTA.  You\u2019re not even really taking much time to yourself.  Ironically, you\u2019re doing exactly what your mom wanted by getting out of the house while the cleaners are there. \n\nYour mom is likely stressed.  Not really your issue to solve, but maybe cut her a little slack.  Wedding stuff tends to make people a little crazed.  Hence her getting in a tizzy about some boxes.  It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re angry or anything, just a bit baffled at your mom right now.", "How did that go for him? I bet you already regret having your wedding on her turf.", "It happens. Wedding planning and events are stressful! Sometimes we snap. Nothing you can do but move on.

I probably would have read it that way, as well.", "I would agree with that. I could have handled it better, and my history with my mother and her somewhat often overstepping and insertions during the wedding process made me too sensitive.", "Ok so it sounds like there\u2019s a lot of backstory here that contributed to the situation. \n\nSounds like you need to start putting up boundaries with your parents. Next time, say no thank you to her hosting a party if you don\u2019t want her so involved or to feel obligated to give her opinion deference.", "I'll give you more backstory. My dad paid for \u2153, my bride's dad paid for \u2153, and my bride and I paid for \u2153 of everything. My mom hasn't paid for anything. She uses my dad's money, and then, frankly, says it's hers.  \n\nOh, I absolutely tried to set up boundaries, but she insisted because, in her words, \"no one else was going to host it.\"  \n\nShe paid $2,000 of my dad's money (which he seemed kinda upset over) that she didn't need to spend, and I didn't want her to. I would have preferred to have it at a restaurant that cost far less money, which my bride and I would have paid for ourselves.  \n\nMy mom spent the money to mow the lawn, mulch, landscape, and deep clean the house. I have said over and over again to consider my bride-to-be's feelings and opinions, and my dad has explained to my mom that it isn't my mom's wedding. I've talked to my mom about the fact that my bride-to-be doesn't want certain things, and my mom is insisting.", "What do you mean it\u2019s your dad\u2019s money? Am I right in assuming there\u2019s a cultural aspect here?"]}
