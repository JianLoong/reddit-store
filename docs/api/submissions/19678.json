One of the girls had a bday party and invited some friends over, and i got along with all of her friends and had a great time and 2 of them asked me if i wanted to smoke with them (my roomates dont smoke weed but i do and they invited me so i went to smoke with them on the balcony). \n\nAfter the party those 2 kept texting me if i wanted to smoke with them and hang out but i didnt wanted to leave the house so i never went, so eventually they decided to just come over to smoke at my place which i was okay with, after that they came over more regularly to the point where they didnt tell my roommate anymore and she was always surprised when they came (sometimes they just come 5minutes after letting me know so i didnt always tell her).\n\nEventually it had gotten to the point where her friends would always come to chill with me and not with her, i always invite her to chill with us but she never really does because we smoke, which is understandable.\n\nThen my other roomate had a bday party and one of the guys (who is gay and again smokes aswell) started to chill with me too, but that was around the time i was moving to a different apartment to live alone upstairs (i was still good with my roommates i just wanted my own space and they respected it).\n\nSo what happened was, the gay guy would sometimes go to chill with my roommate, lie to her and tell her that he needs to go home but come upstairs to see me and smoke instead, without me even knowing that he went to see my roommate. \n\nSo my roommates probably got really offended and since then i was never invited to any of their bday parties ever again. I never did any of it on purpose, i was never the one to text any of their friends first, they all approached me and went out of their way to come to my place and chill (since i dont leave the house).\n\nI now moved back to thailand and completely lost contact with both of my roommates, however, i am still good with the gay guy and then 2 other guys that i met through them and they also dont talk with my roommates anymore.", "created_utc": 1686760741, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/149cit9/aita_for_accidentally_stealing_other_peoples/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
