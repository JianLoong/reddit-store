{"id": 7106, "submission_id": "109kxxo", "title": "AITA for disinviting my late wife's children from my wedding?", "selftext": "About a year ago, my wife (Anna, 60F) of 25 years passed away, 8 months after being diagnosed with cancer. Besides our 25 year old son (Andrew), she also had 3 other children (Allison 42F, Barbara 40F, Caleb 39M) from a prior marriage. Their father was never really around, so I (52M) have raised them as my own basically ever since I married their mom. \n\nAnna's cancer was very difficult for me financially, and I wound up having to downgrade my car to pay for medical bills, and make withdrawals from my 401k, and take on a lot of debt. Shortly after Anna died, I met another woman, Beth (49F) who I have since married. Given that we're living together in Beth's house, selling Anna's house made a lot of sense. When we were packing up the house, I asked Anna's kids if they wanted anything, and they said they didn't. \n\nI invested a large amount of money renovating the house and getting it ready to sell, and eventually found a house-flipping company that would take it on. On the day of the closing, I was surprised to find out that Allison had sent an email to the lending company, telling them that she had been reading up on state law, and that since Anna's kids weren't mine, they were entitled to the portion she would have gotten from the sale. Turns out she was right. I feel like Anna's children deliberately chose to kneecap me, but they're insistent that Allison didn't know what was going on and was just asking questions. I should have been able to take the money Anna and I had saved up and start a new life, but now I'm probably going to have to sell the new motorcycle I just bought and have long wanted, and I'm not going to be able to get myself out of debt. This was supposed to be a fresh start for me, and now I'm stuck with the same old problems I've always had.\n\nThe day of the eventual closing I was still extremely upset, so when I woke up for work, I texted Allison, Barbara, and Caleb and let them know that I'd also been doing my own reading about our state's laws, and it turns out I'm not actually their father, and they should work on their relationship with the person who actually is. I also told them they were no longer welcome at my wedding, which was the next weekend.\n\nUpon finding out I had said that, Andrew was extremely upset with me. We met for lunch the following day, and I asked him to be my Best Man, but he told me that unless I apologized to his siblings, he didn't want to attend my wedding. I was hoping he'd get over it, but he hasn't talked to me since, saying that he's too old to be a 25 year old child of divorce, and that he was offended that I got married the weekend after the anniversary of his mom's funeral. To me, that date isn't particularly meaningful since the date that weighs on my heart is the one that she actually died.\n\nBeth thinks I should just swallow my pride and apologize so that Andrew will talk to me again, but I can't help but feel hard done by here.", "created_utc": 1673483259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109kxxo/aita_for_disinviting_my_late_wifes_children_from/", "score": 563, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What I said about not being their father was sort of a low blow.\n\n2) I put Andrew in a position where he had to choose between me and his siblings.

Yeah, you.are a selfish snd dishonest asshole.", "There is a ton of stuff to unpack here, and I don\u2019t have time to thumb that all out.

Do you want your motorbike and toys, or do you want a family around you? Do you want a crotch rocket that you'll need to sell when your knees give out, or do you want your kids to celebrate your 80th birthday? Like it or not, up until now your deceased's wife's children thought of you as their father; are you willing to step back up and try to get through the grief and pain together? Or are you going to let your family fall apart?", "So you fucked over all the kids you raised and said \u201cI\u2019m not your dad anymore\u201d because *one* of them did their homework and realised what they were owed while you were trying to screw them out of their inheritance?\n\nThen when your only bio kid called you out, you somehow didn\u2019t take that as a wake up call?

You--perhaps inadvertently--were going to cheat your (step)kids out their legally required inheritance. They discovered this, and started asking questions regarding what was legally owed to them.\n\nInstead of being grateful that they caught this before you went any further with this and wound up owing them interest and penalties, you got mad at them and cut them off as your children, barely a year after they lost their mother.\n\nYTA, and I suppose it's good that your state made sure they were protected from a vindictive father figure like you.\n\nAll of this is made worse by the fact that you and your late wife had over two decades of irresponsibility in declining to figure out your finances and wills.

As a father to a child that hasn\u2019t known her biological, I can say I consider her my daughter just the same as my other two.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the kids going for the money isn\u2019t the most family-friendly decision either, but it would have been better to include them from the start.  Since you didn\u2019t, they likely felt forgotten and started thinking about their own life security.

Why wouldn\u2019t you want them to have what they are entitled to? It\u2019s just greed on your part.

First, you totally ignored the fact that Anna's kids would be entitled to an inheritance from their mother. Second, you had a petulant toddler tantrum over having to sell your motorbike, which was an unwise purchase, because you had to know about #1.\nThird, you retaliated against your stepchildren, for whom you were the sole father figure, by hurting their feelings and basically disowning them because they had the nerve to want the inheritance from their mother, to which they were clearly entitled. I get that you went through a very difficult time, but so did your children--all of them. It's not just the OP show. No wonder your bio son is angry.", "Wow, YTA a million times over. You are so petty for telling them you aren\u2019t their father anymore when YOU raised them.

It is quite common in many countries that in the absence of a will, assets will be ~~decided~~ divided amongst spouse and children (percentages varying in different locations). They are not AH for requesting what they are entitled to.\n\nSecond of all, you didn't necessarily raise them, the eldest was nearly an adult when you got married. So while you may be an special person to them, it doesn't mean your are necessarily a paternal figure. \n\nThirdly, you chose to remarry SUPER quickly, which already can be suspicious and, of all 365 days of the year, you chose a date that reminded people of your late wife's death.\n\nEdit : spelling 'divided' not decided", "YTA. Of course her children are entitled to her share of the common asset. You're acting like they have screwed you over. Grow up", "YTA Holy crap so not even a year has passed and you\u2019re already getting remarried. Definition of asshole there. I don\u2019t blame your kids for wanting their share as required by law.

It feels like you didn\u2019t have as good of a relationship with them as you claimed if you could write them off so easily.\n\nEdit to YTA.  Asking if they want her clothes and books is not the same as discussing potential inheritance.
