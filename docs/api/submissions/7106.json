{"id": 7106, "submission_id": "109kxxo", "title": "AITA for disinviting my late wife's children from my wedding?", "selftext": "About a year ago, my wife (Anna, 60F) of 25 years passed away, 8 months after being diagnosed with cancer. Besides our 25 year old son (Andrew), she also had 3 other children (Allison 42F, Barbara 40F, Caleb 39M) from a prior marriage. Their father was never really around, so I (52M) have raised them as my own basically ever since I married their mom. \n\nAnna's cancer was very difficult for me financially, and I wound up having to downgrade my car to pay for medical bills, and make withdrawals from my 401k, and take on a lot of debt. Shortly after Anna died, I met another woman, Beth (49F) who I have since married. Given that we're living together in Beth's house, selling Anna's house made a lot of sense. When we were packing up the house, I asked Anna's kids if they wanted anything, and they said they didn't. \n\nI invested a large amount of money renovating the house and getting it ready to sell, and eventually found a house-flipping company that would take it on. On the day of the closing, I was surprised to find out that Allison had sent an email to the lending company, telling them that she had been reading up on state law, and that since Anna's kids weren't mine, they were entitled to the portion she would have gotten from the sale. Turns out she was right. I feel like Anna's children deliberately chose to kneecap me, but they're insistent that Allison didn't know what was going on and was just asking questions. I should have been able to take the money Anna and I had saved up and start a new life, but now I'm probably going to have to sell the new motorcycle I just bought and have long wanted, and I'm not going to be able to get myself out of debt. This was supposed to be a fresh start for me, and now I'm stuck with the same old problems I've always had.\n\nThe day of the eventual closing I was still extremely upset, so when I woke up for work, I texted Allison, Barbara, and Caleb and let them know that I'd also been doing my own reading about our state's laws, and it turns out I'm not actually their father, and they should work on their relationship with the person who actually is. I also told them they were no longer welcome at my wedding, which was the next weekend.\n\nUpon finding out I had said that, Andrew was extremely upset with me. We met for lunch the following day, and I asked him to be my Best Man, but he told me that unless I apologized to his siblings, he didn't want to attend my wedding. I was hoping he'd get over it, but he hasn't talked to me since, saying that he's too old to be a 25 year old child of divorce, and that he was offended that I got married the weekend after the anniversary of his mom's funeral. To me, that date isn't particularly meaningful since the date that weighs on my heart is the one that she actually died.\n\nBeth thinks I should just swallow my pride and apologize so that Andrew will talk to me again, but I can't help but feel hard done by here.", "created_utc": 1673483259, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/109kxxo/aita_for_disinviting_my_late_wifes_children_from/", "score": 6111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What I said about not being their father was sort of a low blow.\n\n2) I put Andrew in a position where he had to choose between me and his siblings.

Do you want your motorbike and toys, or do you want a family around you? Do you want a crotch rocket that you'll need to sell when your knees give out, or do you want your kids to celebrate your 80th birthday?

They discovered this, and started asking questions regarding what was legally owed to them.\n\nInstead of being grateful that they caught this before you went any further with this and wound up owing them interest and penalties, you got mad at them and cut them off as your children, barely a year after they lost their mother.\n\nYTA, and I suppose it's good that your state made sure they were protected from a vindictive father figure like you.\n\nAll of this is made worse by the fact that you and your late wife had over two decades of irresponsibility in declining to figure out your finances and wills.

As a father to a child that hasn\u2019t known her biological, I can say I consider her my daughter just the same as my other two.  Don\u2019t get me wrong, the kids going for the money isn\u2019t the most family-friendly decision either, but it would have been better to include them from the start.

Why wouldn\u2019t you want them to have what they are entitled to? It\u2019s just greed on your part.

First, you totally ignored the fact that Anna's kids would be entitled to an inheritance from their mother. Second, you had a petulant toddler tantrum over having to sell your motorbike, which was an unwise purchase, because you had to know about #1.\nThird, you retaliated against your stepchildren, for whom you were the sole father figure, by hurting their feelings and basically disowning them because they had the nerve to want the inheritance from their mother, to which they were clearly entitled. I get that you went through a very difficult time, but so did your children--all of them. It's not just the OP show. No wonder your bio son is angry.", "Wow, YTA a million times over. You are so petty for telling them you aren\u2019t their father anymore when YOU raised them.

They are not AH for requesting what they are entitled to.\n\nSecond of all, you didn't necessarily raise them, the eldest was nearly an adult when you got married. So while you may be an special person to them, it doesn't mean your are necessarily a paternal figure. \n\nThirdly, you chose to remarry SUPER quickly, which already can be suspicious and, of all 365 days of the year, you chose a date that reminded people of your late wife's death.\n\nEdit : spelling 'divided' not decided", "YTA.

She was dying in the living room, I was babysitting his two little girls, and he was sleeping with his wife's sister in the bedroom. His wife didn't know, because she had dementia. The kids found out later and no longer speak to him. \n\nI worked in hospice for a while, I saw this happen so many times. Man sleeping with someone else he knows while wife is dying. Oddly enough, I didn't see it happen as much with wives sleeping with others, but who knows.", "This is a real thing, but not always in the depiction we are getting of an AH like OP.

They always stayed married \u201ctil death do us part\u201d - some people just enjoy and prefer companionship and that\u2019s OK. He loved every wife he had until their dying day and after. Just pointing out its not always a disrespectful moment when someone remarries shortly after their previous marriage ended in a widow/widower situation. \n\nBut agree with the majority of the thread here.

Not in a romantic sense but in a, this is the sole person they communicate/rely on/socialize with (and yes, even that relationship can be unhealthy, not actually vulnerable/emotionally open). Whereas my mom, my friends\u2019 moms had social systems and friends that they were open with, made up their social lives, gave them definition outside of their married role. So when wives die for these men that sole structure is gone and there is a panic/scramble of finding someone to reinstate that system for them.

Poor guy.", "Info: who originally bought the house?", "YTA, as probate would have told you that without a will, her assets are split 50/50 between you and her children.  \n\nI\u2019m wondering if there really is a will that gives the house 100% to her children that you \u201cforgot\u201d to give to the probate court.", "ESH.  But more you than them. \n\nLegally, they were entitled to their share all along.  Your and their ignorance of that, changes nothing.  Did you even bother to find out at first?

Why did she write straight to the lending company? \n\nYou could have tried to negotiate with them to pay for part of the renovations, but you\u2019ve destroyed the relationship.  You\u2019ve spent 25 years in a family relationship with them, and you\u2019ve thrown it away.  Why are you surprised your son is supportive of his step-siblings? At least he remembers who his family is.", "If you were blindsided by the kids coming in and claiming that they were entitled to a portion of the proceeds, I understand why you are feeling hurt and cheated. This would be news to me, as well. But this also tells me that you neglected to have a lawyer involved in any of your plans. Even I know enough to see that as a bad move. But ignorance is not necessarily a character flaw. You certainly aren't the first to make that mistake.\n\nWhere you crossed over into YTA territory is when you (reflexively, perhaps, but still an AH move) grabbed your phone and disowned the kids that you had previously called your own. No parent does that.\n\nI'm also suspicious of your description of your relationship with Anna's kids. Why would Allison send an email to the lending company without also telling you that she'd stumbled onto this legal wrinkle?

You should have taken care of this and made sure they got their moms half of the house proceeds.

Women take more time to grieve after a partner died. Both of my grandfathers were widowers and remarried months after their first wives died. My moms mother died in her 20's, and my dads mother in her 50's. I never felt that it was a slight on either of their previous relationships, but I know that my dads sisters never really warmed up to the new wife.

YTA", "How are thee an asshole, let me count the ways.\n\n1. Your wife died a year ago and \"shortly after\" you met another woman and already married her? Yes, I would say that was really shortly.\n2. Your references to material objects as to how you've been impacted. Your car downgrade, your motorcycle. Wahhhhh.\n3. The way you dismiss your new wedding date as not a big deal because you grieve on the date of Anna's death, not her funeral (am I correct to assume the funeral wasn't too long after her death?) It's amazing you can contain your feelings to just that one day. My dad died 9 months ago and I still think about him almost every day.\n4. Anna's adult children have been raised by you since they were teens. You have been their dad for most of their lives. Their mom died. Then you revoked your dad status because you were tantruming about them taking the money that they are legally allowed to have.\n5. You think your son should apologize to *you*, when you have so quickly replaced his mother and tried to alienate him from his siblings.\n\nOP, here is something you and Anna did right: you have 4 kids that care about each other and have a bond that you can't mess with. Andrew has incredible backbone and a clear moral compass.\n\nAll of these kids are feeling stunned, the way kids do (AT ANY AGE), when they lose a parent and then another person shows up on the scene basically immediately. Your wife of a quarter century died after brief illness, the end of which was probably traumatic and hard to watch. You can't just erase it and start over.\n\nDid your kids know what they were doing? I'm sure yes, 100%. You hurt them. Your actions hurt them. Their mother dying hurt them. They hurt you in the only way they could-- your wallet, since you seemed to move on from their mom so quickly.\n\nYou do need to apologize to Andrew. You need to apologize to all of them together. If you don't, I sense you and Beth are going to be quite the empty nesters.", "Exactly. People are missing doing the math. His wife was 35 when they married, and he was 27.\n\nHer three children were *teenagers* (17, 15, and 14). It would have been impossible that he \u201craised them like his own\u201d. He\u2019s exaggerating that for this post.\n\nThey\u2019re legally entitled to inheritance from their mother, and he is so butthurt that they got it that he\u2019s come to whine to us about it.\n\nGood for Andrew for sticking up for his siblings.", ">\"oh boohoo I had to sell my motorbike because those damn kids claimed the inheritance they were obviously entitled to\" \n\nSadly, there are people like this in the world.", "Literally this. Not once did he mention her as an actual person, not once does he talk about his grief or how much he loved her.  Scummy.", "It sounds like his debt is not just those medical bills. He is talking about the \"same old problem (he's) always had\", and his wife was diagnosed 8 months before her death, which occurred a year ago. ~2 years wouldn't constitute \"always\" or a very long time to a 52 year old who has been married for decades and has a son in his 20s. It sounds like he was trying to use this estate money to fix his debt. If this had been shared debt with his late wife, then that's a different story. Wording makes me believe otherwise.", "The downgrading on the car, I understand. It was for a very, sad,my valid purpose. But making a huge purchase when you are still in debt seems not financially sound. It\u2019s this second reference, along with the fact that he\u2019s so upset about parting with it, that caught my eye. I can even understand that maybe this was a bit of a gift to himself after having a very rough few years.  But still, why not wait for the estate to cover some of the debt and then see how much you actually have in hand before buying such a big item?\n\nOn the kids - I think the estate should pay for some or all of the debt (not sure in whose name it was, but hopefully it would have been debt as well, legally, but obviously there are more details involved here).  But if there was enough after paying off the debts, I don\u2019t see that the kids screwed him over.  After all, she was their mother and they knew her for longer than OP did. And if legally they were entitled to it, then it\u2019s a factor to consider. And while I understand that emotionally he feels betrayed, I don\u2019t even get the sense that he has enough detail to understand whether he still might be in the clear. It\u2019s not clear if the numbers prove out that he will be screwed, if he has consulted a lawyer to see what his options are. If he thought Allison tried to kneecap him, then his reaction also seems knee jerk.", "Ah, didn't catch that.\n\nAnd it should be a non-issue, I'm sure the debt from medical bills from Anna's sickness as well as the costs from getting the house ready to be sold would be part of the estate (not sure about the correct terminology) If he had communicated like the father he saw himself as, this could all have been resolved nice and easy...", "Thank you, I'm glad someone else is getting this vibe.", "The real estate is handled differently. There's a title/deed that controls how the property is handled.\n\nThere are two possibilities that may be the case here. \n\n(1) OP and Anna may be listed as simply \"joint tenants.\" If so, idk if this was done on purpose, like if they weren't married yet when the house was purchased, or if they didn't know better. Usually, couples  have the deed as \"joint tenants *with right of survivorship*,\" and the surviving member automatically owns the entire property, regardless of any will or intestate laws. Alternatively, some states allow married couples to be \"joint tenants by the entirety,\" which would also allow a surviving spouse to own all.\n\n(2) The house was simply Anna's, in which case, her will or the state's intestate law would govern. If she didn't have a will, most states grant the entire estate to the surviving spouse. However, some may give 50% to her children, or her will may have specified that 50% of all her assets (including the house) goes to her husband and 50% to her children. \n\nIt's possible that all parties are innocent here of financial shenanigans, but OP is YTA for the way he treated his stepkids, who thought of him as a father, just because an email inquiry rattled his financial plans. \n\n(Please note that these are just guesses. I am not providing legal advice.)", "If he had been bled dry he wouldn\u2019t have bought a motorcycle and started renovations right after she died lmao those aren\u2019t purchases someone who was bled dry for US level of outrageous medical bills can take on.", "Totally. it is different saying \"would you like this vase I'm getting rid of\" than saying \"would you like to be excised from your mother's estate.\" He seems to think the former is the same as the latter -- the kids were watching their mother's whole estate try up and eventually very likely be given to a woman who is only 7 years senior to the oldest of Anna's children.", "YTA.\n\nYou were going to sell their mother's home without considering giving them any of the proceeds, that was bad enough, but your reaction to them is truly cruel. Those children she raised were the last tie you had to your late wife. You clearly don't care about them or you wouldn't have escalated this so spitefully. You have completely disgraced her memory, the love she had for them, and ruined what ever image they had of you as a father in their lives. What a petty and shortsighted perspective you have. Enjoy your new toys, new life, and new wife, they're all you've got now.", "I thought it was pretty well known that men remarry much faster after the death of a spouse. I\u2019m a tax preparer by profession and run up against this a lot. If the surviving spouse does NOT remarry in the same year as the death then they file a married filing jointly return with the deceased spouse. If they DO remarry in the same year as the death then they file a married filing jointly return with the new spouse and file a married filing separately return on behalf of the deceased spouse. I typically prepare several of these returns each year and have yet to have the remarried spouse be the wife.

Like he's claiming to be in debt and financial trouble, yet he went and got a new motorcycle before making sure this debt was cleared? At that age you can't rely on money you don't have in hand. That's something most learn as a young adult. Only count on money you have, not on money you might have. Then he wanted us to feel sorry for him that he couldn't keep his new motorcycle, when the kids should be entitled to an inheritance from their mother who owned half the house (maybe more for all we know she paid for it all)"]}
