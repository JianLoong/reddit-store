None of that is OK, ever. \n\nYTA. Trimming up loose scraglers.. fine. You want him to cut off over half his length. You can't ask that. So if you really want to torpedo your relationship with your brother over a beard.. then that says more about you than anything.", "YTA like the duck dynasty guys except worse", "YTA why is this guy your best man if you do not respect his wishes.

You are well within your rights to respectfully request the trim for him to be in the groom's party. He is well within his rights to respectfully decline to do so.  Unless I missed it, I did not read anything about you pressuring or harassing or disowning. You asked, he answered.  As long as it ends there with no resentments, I fail to see that assholery other are seeing.\n\nEdit: dude.  YTA.  Do you know how long that thing took to grow? That's like asking a bridesmaid with waist length hair to cut it to her shoulders. If the hygiene of the beard is the issue, have him do something similar to bridesmaid's hair and makeup.  Someone could condition it, brush it, make it presentable. Maybe even braid or knot it for the event.  Just because it is messy, small or whatever on a normal day does not mean it will be for the wedding day.  I am messy and smelly on days I don't go anywhere, stay in jamas and don't shower. But I clean up good for a wedding.  As does everyone else.\n\n\nMy answer changed due to the extent to which you want it \"trimmed\" and your response to his response.  Based on your attitude toward the beard I get the feeling this is not the first time it have been a topic of discussion, and not in a good way.  His response sounds appropriate if this has been an ongoing nagging issue between you two.", "YTA but he said he\u2019s fine with it so move on and pick another best man.", "Info: Does it have to be trimmed? What about grooming it? That way, the day after the wedding, he can go back to whatever he would like, but still have a nice look for the wedding itself.", "INFO: why does he have to trim it? is it not ok for him to just brush and moisturize it, or style it for the wedding?", "Why don't you just ask him to groom it for that day? Lots of people do their long beards in a braid for special events, there are lots of beard care products he could use without having to cut it. You really shouldn't ask people to change themselves drastically just for your wedding. This isn't like asking him to not give an embarrassing speech or bringing a plus one you don't like, it's literally his body. You can probably find a hair stylist that can fix the beard hair to be nicely groomed without trimming it. You definitely owe him an apology. There are other solutions to your problem", "So you asked him to trim his beard. He said no, you then told him he couldn\u2019t be in your wedding, he said fine. So what exactly is the problem?

Obviously, there are some legitimate issues.\n\nThis dude is asking his brother to cut his beard that took years to grow and is quite litterally a part of him... because he doesn't like it. Throw it in a braid, tuck it up, wax, and style it. But does it demand it be cut, or is his bro cut out? \n\nOP is undoubtedly the asshole here. You can have styles, a clothing dress code, hell go oldschool and pick out matching outfits. But you don't get to tell people to hide their tattoos (unless inappropriate), take out piercings, cut their hair, or anything else to do with THEIR BODY.", "The beard is described as full of food and dirt and smelly", "It isn't permanent, and it will grow back..I would do it for my bro but we are a close family. Unless the beard is long for religious reasons..and in this case I think not.", "Its not in the original post bc op is adding it now that people are calling him TA. Otherwise why *wouldn't* it be in the post? Among the many other changed details from the comments.", "Forgive me for this because it's going to sound really stupid. However, I have pregnancy brain and it's making me really dumb. Does that mean that it's taken you a year to grow it that long?", "Hahaha! That was the first thing I thought! \"This person has obviously never heard of or seen ZZ Top. Must be a young'un!\"", "Yeah buried in the comments OP notes that he wants his brother to cut his waste length beard to chest length more or less not just tidy it up", "The brothers been growing that beard for longer than the marriage is gonna last, lol", "And just imagine how sad he\u2019ll be a few years down the road when he\u2019s divorced from this woman and still estranged from his brother over her whims.", "If it's part of his identity (as my hair is for me - without any religion) it's just a no-go. It's permanent for months and far too much for a single day since it's not a matter of weeks bot months, if not years. \n\nIn my opinion it is completely inappropriate to expect bodily changes which can't be reverted in a single day.", "OP made the first few comments that included this info minutes after he posted, so no, it's not *now that people call him ta*", "My future son in law discovered beard care and yes his beard routine is more extensive than my daughter\u2019s skin and hair care routines combined! But it makes a huge difference. My son is growing his beard out longer than he ever has before because he wants to braid it. (Thanks Balder\u2019s Gate) We might be getting him some beard care products for Christmas!", "Hubby has a beard (curly beard hair) and i hate it, BUT he shampoos it when he washes his hair, moisterises the skin underneath tonhelp prevent too much drying out and dandruff, has a shaping stencil to help keep his face and neck tidy and respectable, he trims the moustache part so it doesn't go up my nose as much (the main reason i hate it and trimming doesn't solve the problem). He gets it professionally shaped every 6months when he gets his hair trimmed (to follow workplace health and safety). My point is he looks after it, and it doesn't get unruly. \n\nAsking for a trim and tidy up of the beard is standard like asking bridesmaids to trim their hair to get rid of dead ends (honestly something all the girls I know do anytime we have been asked to be bridal party members) but asking for chunks of length to be removed from the beard or shaving entirely equals a bride demanding bridesmaids drastically cut their hair  or change their hair colour.", "It means I didn\u2019t shave/trim it for a year. Other than shaping it up.", "Probably, my side of the family constantly shits on my beard and then this is something they would post lol\n\nMeanwhile the people important to me like my wife and kids hate when I\u2019ve cut it back\n\nImagine that\n\nI also found an employer where if anyone says anything it\u2019s \u201cnice beard\u201d", "Its giving the same energy when curly haired people are expected to straighten their hair", "Lol! I suddenly had a vision of a long ZZ Top beard with a bow tie around just the beard at neck level! \u201cThere! Now you can see the fucking thing! HAPPY?\u201d\nMy brain thinks in comic strips.", "At that point, you keep styling the beard as outlandishly as you can in malicious compliance. It's blocking the bow tie? Part it in the middle around the bow. Too long? Tuck each side back behind your ears. Roll it the beard equivalent of Victory Rolls and pin curls along the jawline. 20 tiny braids. Full Viking/LOTR Dwarf style multibraids with beads. Tiny bows like when the Lion got a spa day in Emerald City.", "It's like telling a woman she has to cut her long hair short, or bleach her hair to match the theme...", "Meh the only photos I look at/ kept are the ones from the photo booth we had set up as they are fun and genuine\n\nThe professional photos are in a book somewhere lol", "I have also made radical changes to my hair length, too..it just hair, not my identity. I am bald the moment and think this is the best cut ever \ud83d\ude06 I am glad you feel strongly about your hair.

However, OP mentioned that his brother's is unkempt, often has food stains and smells, so if taken at his word, I'm not ready to render judgement.", "A beard balm or wax with some hold may be needed, but, yeah, if it's the unruly part that's the problem, and not the length, per se, then don't styling would very likely solve the problem :-)", "You think women are routinely asked to cut ~1/2 their hair for a wedding? Growing it out isn't necessary because of extensions unless you want to grow it out. Styling and trimming are different than chopping off hair that will take 5+ years to grow back. \n    Not trying to be nasty but do you have evidence about women being told cut or grow their hair? I don't think being forced to grow.your hair is quite as egregious but unless the wedding is planned 5 years in advance how much hair can be grown anyway? 6 hours is definitely a lot but nowhere close to 5 plus years. \n      Also he wasn't asked, he was given an ultimatum.  If he was told it had to be combed and styled and to \"neaten up the strays\" that would be normal, demanding he change from a long beard to X length beard is insulting and demeaning.", "What is odd is excluding someone from an important aspect of your life because he wouldn't look good on a picture.", "The memories and photos typically are forever, though.\n\n*If* they wanted him to even it and oil/ comb his beard that is one thing. Like asking your wedding party to look presentable. Lots of people keep wedding photos out permanently. My sister has her wedding photos in her hall. Almost 20 years, for her. Photos still out.\n\nThe guests are one thing but you typically have the wedding party in the formal photos and people wanting a nice picture in their home isn't crazy.\n\nNeat and presentable is a pretty normal standard for a formal photo.\n\nCutting in half is ridiculous but asking everyone look neat and presentable and have evenly trimmed hair and be well-groomed isn't exactly being too much. Having a physical momento means a lot, for some people. Both my grandparents had or still have their wedding photos out. My grandpa passed years ago. Grandma has their wedding photos out, still. My grandparents on the other side had theirs on display for 70 years. It meant something to them. A keepsake from their youth.", "A bear doil is short for bear doilies.

It is a right of passage in my family.", "You\u2019ve never had a bit of hair oil put in your hair? Like on your head? It\u2019s not gross at all. I encourage you to find one for your beard that is lightweight and watch how healthy your beard looks and feels. Typically a whole thick head of hair needs less than a dime size amount, first rubbed between the hands and then lightly finger combed through so it isn\u2019t oily in one spot. Grease is what I use to describe unclean hair- the sebum produced by hair follicles and outside pollutants. Oil is the fancy stuff formulated for hair\ud83d\ude05", "The same way. I'm 40 but I still dress goth. However, I tone it down unless I'm going out with friends. Usually just black shirts and black pants. Sometimes I'll wear the black lipstick. I also have long black hair. I have people telling me that I need to dye my hair a different color because *YoU lOOk teRRIble, yOu lOOk reaLLy pALe*. I also have them asking me, don't you think you're a little old for that? I'd have thought you'd have grown out of that by now. Dude, there's people older than me who do it. It's not their body and none of their business. I fucking hate people who do that.", "Me too. My friend has what he refers to as the wizard beard. It's all the way down to his belly button.
