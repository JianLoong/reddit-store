All our groomsmen wore whatever suit they had already and we let them pick goodwill ties out of a box. Our pictures are an absolute hodgepodge of people and outfits, but the one thing that was most important to me was that the people we loved were there to celebrate with us. \n\n\u201cA normal and respectful manner\u201d is wildly subjective, and considering that came with an ultimatum, then I\u2019d say that was pretty damn disrespectful.", "YTA\n\nShouldn\u2019t the best man be someone you actually care about?", "YTA, you asked your brother if he could trim his beard for your wedding, he declined.

None of that is OK, ever. \n\nYTA. Trimming up loose scraglers.. fine. You want him to cut off over half his length. You can't ask that. So if you really want to torpedo your relationship with your brother over a beard.. then that says more about you than anything.", "YTA like the duck dynasty guys except worse", "YTA why is this guy your best man if you do not respect his wishes. You are going to destroy your relationship over something so petty?", "How is there even a conflict? You already came to a compromise.", "N T A - I don't understand the Y T A responses.  You are well within your rights to respectfully request the trim for him to be in the groom's party. He is well within his rights to respectfully decline to do so.  Unless I missed it, I did not read anything about you pressuring or harassing or disowning. You asked, he answered.  As long as it ends there with no resentments, I fail to see that assholery other are seeing.\n\nEdit: dude.  YTA.  Do you know how long that thing took to grow? That's like asking a bridesmaid with waist length hair to cut it to her shoulders. If the hygiene of the beard is the issue, have him do something similar to bridesmaid's hair and makeup.  Someone could condition it, brush it, make it presentable. Maybe even braid or knot it for the event.  Just because it is messy, small or whatever on a normal day does not mean it will be for the wedding day.  I am messy and smelly on days I don't go anywhere, stay in jamas and don't shower. But I clean up good for a wedding.  As does everyone else.\n\n\nMy answer changed due to the extent to which you want it \"trimmed\" and your response to his response.  Based on your attitude toward the beard I get the feeling this is not the first time it have been a topic of discussion, and not in a good way.

Lots of people do their long beards in a braid for special events, there are lots of beard care products he could use without having to cut it. You really shouldn't ask people to change themselves drastically just for your wedding. This isn't like asking him to not give an embarrassing speech or bringing a plus one you don't like, it's literally his body.
