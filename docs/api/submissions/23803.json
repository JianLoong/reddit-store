I never thought I'd be posting here, but I need some unbiased opinions on a situation I'm dealing with. I (28f, Hindu) am about to marry my fianc\u00e9(29m, Christian)  in the US. We're really excited about our upcoming wedding, which will have both a Christian and Hindu ceremony to honor both our Religious backgrounds. However, I'm currently having a major conflict with my future MIL (F50s) over the color of my wedding dress for my Christian ceremony.\r  \n\r\n\nIn Hinduism, white clothes are traditionally associated with mourning and funerals, so they're not considered appropriate for occasions like weddings. I've explained this religious significance to my MIL, telling her why I'm uncomfortable wearing a white gown for my Christian ceremony. She  accused me of disrespecting cultural values.\r\n\n\rMy MIL even went ahead and demanded that I wear her wedding dress, completely disregarding my feelings. She insists I wear it to show respect for her family's traditions. I've tried to compromise by suggesting wearing an off-white or a light pink gown, which I would be more comfortable wearing. But she immediately shut down that option and insisted on her choice.\r\n\nI feel guilty because my family and I have a complete say about all the Hindu ceremonies (the wedding, sangeet, mehendi, etc.), but my fianc\u00e9s family is only organizing the Christian ceremony on the day of the wedding. My fianc\u00e9 is also doing all that is done by a groom in a traditional Hindu wedding (which is quite a lot more than what I am expected), so should I compromise on this one thing?\n\nMy fianc\u00e9's a bit mad at his mom and told her to cut it out repeatedly, but she always finds a way to bring it up again mostly when I'm alone with her.\n\nI'm not trying to undermine MIL's cultural traditions, but I also want my wedding day to reflect who I am and what I believe in.\n\n\r  \n\r", "created_utc": 1691072089, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15h5fob/aita_for_disrespecting_cultural_and_religious/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There is no established tradition to wear your mother in law\u2019s wedding dress. If anything, women in the US are more likely to wear their own mother\u2019s wedding dress or an altered version of it. While white is the most traditional wedding dress color in the US, I find it very disrespectful of your mother in law to insist on it with your personal cultural background. A compromise of an off-white gown is perfectly American, culturally. *You* have the final say when it comes to your side of things, it isn\u2019t your family\u2019s say, they just support you. When it comes to the Christian side of things it is your husband\u2019s say and no one else\u2019s, and he thinks his mother is being ridiculous. His family should support him there.", "NTA. An off white or pink gown are both appropriate colors for a bride to wear to a Christian wedding.

This isn't about religion or culture; it's about control.\n\nPlenty of U.S. brides don't wear white. It's certainly not mandatory. Trying to get you to wear her wedding dress is pure bullying. It's your wedding and your choice.\n\nMIL is using your ignorance to plan your wedding *her* way. Stop listening to her.\n\nSuggestions: talk to your husband about what MIL is doing and about the possibility of not inviting her at all. Refuse to talk to MIL at all without your husband present. He can and should screen you from some of her abuse.", "Wearing white isn't even a Christian tradition. It's just a social norm.", "NTA.   If you take religion/cultural issues completely out of it, your prospective MIL is still TA.

That's just weird.", "NTA\n\nYour wedding, your choice.\n\nAnd apart from that: White wedding dresses are not a Christian tradition but just a fashion that only started in Victorian times - and even then only for the upper class.

I mean my mom didn't have a white Wedding Dress and no one said anything.  (She wore a Dirndl). \n\nYou can wear what you want to your wedding. Historically people used the best gown they had for the Wedding and that was it. And if they had one made for the Wedding, the thought about wearing it again, maybe for Mass or something.  So a pure White Dress would have been impractical here. \n\nAlso a butter yellow dress would look beautiful imo. Who needs white. Wear what you want. It's not about Christian Religion, it's fashion.", "NTA. You are not undermining her cultural traditions, she is undermining yours.

Somethings do.  Have to meet half way on the dress, you have, she hasn't.  I think wearing YOUR off white dress is a perfectly reasonable compromise.  Stick to your guns or MIL will be a thorn in your side forever if she is going to start off disrespecting you here and now.", "NTA, you are uncomfortable with wearing a white wedding dress and made a reasonable compromise.

You also stated that your fiance is completely adhering to all of your culture norms. Why are you disrespecting his? This is a really bad way to start a marriage.

I guess you are just cherry picking parts that you like.", "YTA. If you are having 2 ceremonies to celebrate both of your backgrounds then you need to honor both of your backgrounds. You can't expect him to do everything necessary to meet your Hindu background and then think you can call the shots about the Christian ceremony for him. Either learn to compromise for the sake of your marriage or call everything off now.  Coming from 2 different backgrounds will only work of either one of you is truly willing to switch to following the other religion and cultural practices or if you have strong compromise skills.", "YTA if you and your family have the expectation that your fiance follow through with Hindu traditions why can't you do the same for his family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There's an old superstition about \"Marry in black, you'll wish yourself back\" (because of funeral clothing, literally the same reasoning as OP) but that's basically the only color restriction in the Western world until the early-mid 20th century, when white became fashionable for weddings among the lower classes. \n\nCut to today's modern bridal industry, which is generally considered to be wasteful, too expensive, and requires months of pre-planning for a dress that will generally be considered old-fashioned by the time you receive your wedding dress, let alone looking back at it.

I'm sad I had to scroll this far to find common sense.  The Hindu ceremony is her wedding. The Christian one of for her husband.
