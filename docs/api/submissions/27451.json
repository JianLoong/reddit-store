The older one is 21 and in college and works a part time job on the side. The younger one is 16 and still in high-school.\n\nMy husband's brother has two sons as well who are 24 and 28. The older one is very nice and polite but the younger one (let's call him Simon) had always been problematic since I can remember. He's a very picky eater, refuses to even bother engaging in a conversation unless he's interested in it and would always be the one getting fussy if we go somewhere on a family gathering. He hardly ever addresses me and whenever he used to come over whether by himself or with his brother, he barely managed to greet me. If I ask him personal questions, he shuts me down easily. \n\n\nHowever he and my husband seem to have a good friendship and even talk on the phone once or twice a week.\n\nMy husband's brother works two jobs and  wasn't always a very present father. So Simon had attached himself to my husband even as a kid because of availability and common interests. When he was around 5, Simon even used to say he wants to marry my husband. We all saw it as a joke and moved past it but I found the attachment odd since then.\n\nHe and my husband both like guns, hunting, video games and the same types of music. Even cars too which is my husband's main hobby these days.\n\nA few months ago Simon wanted to go on a hunting trip with his father but got refused so my husband offered to take him instead. I told him he should take our sons too and Simon's brother so it would be like a family bonding experience. \n\nHe agreed but apparently it didn't go well. My older son and Simon's brother didn't like it and my younger son was on his phone the whole time and complained since the hunting grounds are further away and require a lot of walking. My husband told me this and said he wouldn't force anyone else to come if they didn't want to.\n\nBut ever since then, he and Simon spend a lot of time together. They go hiking every other Sunday in the morning and Simon often comes over to help my husband with the cars he's fixing up or play games while I'm at work. Simon only briefly greets me while often times not even bothering to greet his cousins.\n\nMy younger son told me he asked my husband for something but he told him he'll do it later and then forgot about it. It upset me because I feel like he's neglecting our sons while having no issues spending time with his nephew and always talking to him on the phone. Simon seems more like a son to him than our actual sons and it really bothers me.\n\nHe claims I'm overreacting and it's not a big deal. And that he tried to spend time with our sons but they don't seem all that interested in doing what he likes doing. I told him they're his sons and he should show more interest but he claims I'm being too pushy and overbearing.\n\nEvery time I bring it up with him he gets annoyed.", "created_utc": 1695459551, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16pziuu/aita_for_telling_my_husband_he_needs_to_spend/", "score": 1581, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And especially not in the \"autism bad\" way. I was trying to garner understanding for people who are different, and disagree with the adjective \"problematic\" in this context.

He is doing to his younger son what his brother does to his nephew except his son doesn\u2019t have an uncle who he could bond.", "NTA\n\nI think there's a few things you are rightly upset about and things that, in my view, should change:\n\n* Simon barely acknowledges your presence and is impolite towards you and your sons. I think that's an issue IF he is coming yo YOUR home. I would talk to your husband about this and say that Simon needs to improve his attitude if he were to remain welcome at YOUR home. Simon doesn't have to become best buddies with you or your sons but he should behave in a polite manner which includes greeting you and your sons (if they are present), asking how you are doing, and replying if he is asked how he is doing. That's just manners and he should have them considering he is a grown man.\n* Your husband is neglecting his own kids in favour of spending time with Simon. I think that's an issue with regards to your younger son who is only 16 and still lives at home. Husband should show interest in what your youngest son is doing even if it's not his hobby or something he isn't interested in. It's called parenting. It sounds like the 16 year old is not very outdoorsy and maybe not so fit (complaining about the hiking trip), but maybe husband and him can find some kind of physical activity they both like (gym, (indoor) soccer, tennis, bouldering, or maybe something like snooker/pool/darts assuming a 16 year old is welcome there where you can do these things). I don't think you can force your husband to spend that much time with your 21 year old as he lives away for college, or does he still live at home? At that age most people have their own lives and possibly not that much interest in doing things with their parents. If your older son does ask for time with your husband and your husband refuses, then maybe it's time to talk to husband about this too.\n* I don't think you can stop husband from spending time with Simon, as long as husband doesn't neglect his own kids or you. If you are not comfortable with Simon being over at your house as much as he is, then that's another story. I can understand not wanting someone you don't like that much being around several days of the week. So if this bothers you, talk to your husband about it. What bothers you (is it Simon's rudeness, is it having a guest (any guest) at the house so often because you feel you can't freely enjoy the house then, etc).\n* Have you talked to both your sons about their relationship with their dad? Ask if they feel they can get as much time with husband if they want, whether husband is open to doing things THEY like or if husband says no to their suggested activities, etc.\n* I want to add that Simon shouldn't be coming over unannounced. This would bother me to no end no matter who it was, and more so when this is someone who barely acknowledges your existence.", "NTA\n\nHe is their father and should be making an effort to do what they are interested in not just what he wants to do. Not everyone is in to Hiking and killing animals for fun.\n\nKeep being pushy and overbearing until he spends time with his own boys.", "NAH. i get that you want your husband to spend more time with your sons, but if they themselves arent really bothered to reciprocate then how would he force it upon him. its a two-way street right, and looks like your husband isnt taking an interest in what both your sons are doing and vice verse for the sons. so its no wonder that he is spending more time with the kid who shares his interests. you arent an AH for wanting him to spend more time, but dont force it on him.", "For more context, since I couldn't type it in too much in the post.\n\nSimon is very close to my husband. He often comes over unannounced, gets annoyed if he sees my husbsnd isn't home alone and when I'm working, he and my husband go out to restaurants and other places.\n\nOne time I came home from work and saw Simon crying in my husband's arms and holding onto him desperately. Apparently one of his online friends died but the story seemed a bit inconsistent to me.\n\nI've always tried to be nice to him, offer him food and try to make conversation and jokes but he seems like he can't wait to get away from me. He doesn't talk to my younger son at all and only briefly with my older one, small talk about movies or their studies/work.", "Maybe your husband could schedule regular reminders to ask your sons to do things together, like go to a restaurant or events. If they refuse, well, okay, he should keep trying, because even if they don't or can't go, they will always remember Dad making the effort. Hopefully, you will also give him credit for that, regardless of whether it culminates in an activity or not, because it's not enjoyable to be rejected.\n\nIt must feel like a bit of a betrayal for your husband to be so connected to someone who openly dislikes you. That's understandable. His behavior is more TA in this situation. To your credit, though, you have conflicting feelings about it, recognizing that he is still a child. That being said, you deserve to be treated with respect, especially in your own home, when you've been kind to him. IMO, your husband should insist on this.", "NTA for wanting your husband to refocus his priority to his sons when it\u2019s lacking\u2026   \n\n\nBut\u2026 do his sons actually share interests with him? It sounds like Simon and your husband have a mutual appreciation for what they do, and your other sons aren\u2019t into that stuff. Is Simon the buddy your husband wants to hang with? Can you find something your sons and husband are both into and encourage them to spend time together on something mutually enjoyable?   \n\n\nAlso\u2026 does Simon have a neurodiversity? Maybe just pause in your dislike of his difference and ponder that. Everything you\u2019ve said about his social skills points to one. He might not have one, but it sounds like he might, and if he does then he\u2019s not actively excluding you (even if it feels like that, like he\u2019s intentionally rude)\u2026 he just has a different social language to yours and is a deep minority.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But YOUR attitude disturbs me the most (even disgusts me, in places) - albeit probably not for the reasons you think. Firstly though, there's nothing wrong with wanting your husband to spend more time with your sons (though have you checked if your sons actually WANT to - or is this just a 'you' issue?) \n\nIf your sons DO want it - then I agree that shouldn't just happen, if it happens to align with your husband's interests. Your husband should make more effort. But you seem hellbent on scapegoating Simon for it, and undermining the validity of his bond with your husband. Simon's NOT responsible for your husband's bond with your sons (Simon probably wouldn't get this attention either, if he didn't share interests with your husband). \n\nAnd I'm absolutely disgusted with your comment that Simon (at age 5) would say he wanted to marry your husband. You raise this in the context, that you've found Simon's attachment to your husband 'odd' since then. So what was your problem?! Were you concerned the 5-year-old was a threat to your marriage, because said 5-year-old wanted to be the 'other woman'?! Or are you trying to imply Simon currently wants to f*** your husband?! You are trying to abnormalise Simon in a revolting way, based on a NORMAL childhood comment. \n\nIndeed, research has shown how common (and normal) such sentiments are, in young children. I remember I used to say I wanted to marry my Grandmother. It's entirely innocent. It's because young children don't really understand the differences between romantic/sexual love, vs. the familial love (that they feel for their attachment figures). They assume all love is basically the same. Meanwhile, children are told people marry, because they 'love each other'. \n\nAnd since young children know they love their attachment figures, they simply assume that means they will marry them. It does NOT imply inappropriate or sexual feelings towards the adult. You only dropped that irrelevant detail in, to try to pathologise Simon's bond with your husband. But his attachment to your husband is HEALTHY, especially since his own Dad isn't very involved. \n\nSimon shouldn't be offhand with you, no. He MIGHT be an asshole for that. But who knows? Maybe he picked up at a young age, that you had a bizarre, jealous, and disapproving attitude towards him (and his bond with your husband). Maybe he would have bonded better with YOU, if he'd detected enough positivity towards him - and if he wasn't picking up vibes, you want to interfere with his relationship with his Uncle. \n\nIt might also be that Simon has some sort of disorder, which influences his behaviour. But you don't seem to consider that possibility. Plus, it's not even very relevant to the question in the post, that Simon doesn't talk to you much. Again, everything seems based on abnormalising/blaming Simon.", "YTA. Stop trying to destroy the relationship between Simon and your husband just because you don't like Simon.", "YTA. Most likely your husband\u2019s nephew sees him as a dad.", "ESH.  It very much sounds like the nephew could be autistic, but instead of thinking there could be some underlying reason for his behaviour, you have basically just labeled him as rude and left it at that. You are also dismissive of the fact that for much of his life, he has had an absentee father and your husband has at least tried to fill that role. Naturally, he is attached.\n\nYour husband is being an AH because he doesn\u2019t seem to think anything matters except for his own interests when it comes to your sons.  It is selfish of him to only want to spend time with the kids on his terms. Why cannot they do their hobbies of interests when he spends time with them? Why not go away on a weekend with just them (together or individually) doing something that they enjoy? The fact that he does these things with Simon and not them says a lot. And the fact that it\u2019s because it also overlaps with his interests is even worse - as if they are only worth spending time with if they do what he wants.  This is actually the real problem, not Simon.  Your husband needs to recognise this and address it.", "YTA\n\nPartly for trying to say he can't do stuff regarding shared interests with his nephew, but mostly for holding on to a comment made by a FIVE YEAR OLD for nineteen years so you could justify your bizarre jealousy.\n\nNews flash: five year old say weird shit and don't understand what marriage actually means.\n\nThe fact that you said that strongly suggests there's a lot of petty, petty shit you're leaving out of this.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and Simon like the same things, so it's easy to bond. But that is making him believe that it is your son's who are the problem for not liking his activities.\n\nYou're absolutely right that he needs to put the effort in more with his own children. Otherwise, he'll be wondering why they make no effort with him in the future. That doesn't mean he can't still see Simon, but if he's directing all of his paternal energy onto Simon, that's a big problem.\n\nSimon's attitude towards you and your children is likely a result of jealousy from his side that he didn't get the father that your sons have.

That probably really eats away at his confidence. And then at home, his dad can't be arsed to take an interest in him because his dad is too busy with your son's cousin.

I assume you try to be very involved with your younger son, but he also needs his dad.

I have difficulty making friends, so I try and stick with the ones I\u2019ve got. Maybe try and include Simon and your husband in more activities so that your sons get attention as well?

But Simon also isn't a kid, and if everyone thinks of him that way, maybe see my point above.  Your younger son is a teen, and teens can be really hard to relate to.  A lot of parents have trouble bonding with their teenagers.  His relationship with Simon is an adult-adult relationship at this point, AND - Simon is probably a young millennial while your son is definitely Gen Z .

When we raise our kids there are many times we enjoy spending time with them, but there's also many times that we do it because we have to. When our kids are adults we are almost exclusively spending time with them because we want to. Which sort of changes the relationship into one where friendship is involved and not just blood relations. Of course we end up bonding more deeply over things we like to do. I cook with one of my adult kids, I go to the gym with another. Etc etc.\n\nI think nephew has entered that friend zone with your husband and he's hanging out with him because they get along and they enjoy doing the same activities. Unfortunately I also think that because they're related the waters are kind of muddied, especially with you. You see it as him spending time with family instead of your boys and he sees it as hanging out with a friend that it is doing the same activity as him. \n\nIt seems like right now is a point in time when your husband's going to have to spend time with your boys because it's the right thing to do, maybe not necessarily because he enjoys it. It sounds like your husband's being very selfish and only wanting to do the activities he wants to do, and when our kids are younger we often end up doing what they want to do. \n\nI think NTA because your husband isn't spending time with your kids at all and he in fact sounds resentful that they don't like the things he does...when he's the one that should be getting interested in what they do! If I had to listen to teenage gossip one more time I probably would have pulled my hair out, but I listened to it because that was important to my kid.

If your young child wants to play hide and seek are you going to say no because they wont reciprocate by going to the bar with you?

Simon and the OP's are and so they are able to hit it off. Your husband tries but your sons aren't interested. Its not possible to force either side as their interests are unlikely to change. Going to public places also will involve conversations of interests.", "See the dad isnt even attempting because that don't like to do his hobbies.

They've been shunted to the side and aren't about to fight for their dads attention. They don't like hunting and hiking, why doesn't the dad invite them to dinner, this man forgot to do something for his 16 yr son but didn't forgot he had plans with his nephew. \n\nMy dad likes cars, bikes, rap music, and UFC I hate all of those things with a passion... yet my dad and I still go out to the dinner and he tries to find common interest, take some interests in the things I like and is enthusiastic to spend time with me even if we don't have much in common because that's parenting, no matter how old you kid is. My dad hangs out my cousins as well because \"lads, lads, lads,\" \ud83d\ude02 but never would he overlook me to spend his time with them. \n\nThis situation is no different from calling out parents who spend so much time with one kid while knowing hardly anything about the other kid. Favoritism is never ok, it's understandable to want to hang with someone with common interests, but you don't just ignore your other kids. \n\nThe hunting trip was bound to be a buss, the others aren't huge fans of it and Simon probably didn't really want them their as well, so no you have forced interactions, animosity coupled with non interests.

When I was watching tv, he\u2019d end up watching my shows due to proximity and usually they weren\u2019t really the types he\u2019d get into on his own, but when I got home from school he\u2019d ask when I was gonna start watching it again (some of them he REALLY got into but never would have given a chance if I hadn\u2019t been watching it). He has some addiction issues and has been in and out of my life, but [when] he\u2019s here and clean, we have a wonderful relationship. But that\u2019s because he made sure to foster it. Even with my sister, and she was highly resistant to building a relationship with him when he first got clean. He just gave her time and distance while still being there. She eventually worked through those emotions and now she talks to him more regularly than I do. People vary so results will always be different. Many people would never have been able to be close with a father that years prior had abandoned them, and that\u2019s also normal and okay.

How would you feel about the relationship if, instead of acting this way towards your nephew, your husband was acting this way towards a non-related friend, younger or his age?\n\nIMO the parent should be the one to show interest in their kids' interests first if they want a close relationship. The parent is older and should have more experience building relationships in general.

Since they've lived less hours overall, 1 hour is a larger % of their overall hours lived than it is for a parent. I'd feel differently if your husband invested time in their interests first, but it seems like he may have not put in that work.\n\nInstead of forcing them to be close through shared disinterests, why not instead have your family figure out everyone's love language and try to encourage strong relationships that way instead?

You\u2019ve been very clear that is what he\u2019s doing. Lunch and dinner dates with your own boys. Share YOUR interests with them and spend your time and caring with your kids. They deserve for it to be done right so they have a good example for how to live their own life.", "YTA \nYou *are* being pushy and overwhelming.\nYour husband likes what he likes. If he can share that with someone, then so much the better. He should not change to be with his sons, nor should they. They still have that bond. \nIt sounds like you don't like Simon (who probably realised it long ago) and are set on driving a wedge into his relationship with your husband. What a peach you are.", "How about the husband ask the kids and see what there interests are and do stuff they like. There kids. Why the hell do the kids have to like what the dad likes for the dad to spend time with them? Should he be the one who should be more open to asking \u201chis\u201d own kids they like and work around that. Ok so he has a bond with nephew but shit kids you yourself brought into the world should be first not a relative kid. And the disrespect he shows by not say hi to his aunt in her own home is a little much. Doesn\u2019t matter his age. You are what you are taught and will carry forward. So when he is an adult and doesn\u2019t greet the house owner he would be the ass but not if he\u2019s a kid because he\u2019s a kid? People seriously!!!!! NTA. Op put your foot down otherwise it\u2019s going to get worse and time will have passed and your kids will be distant because there own father basically ignored them. Kids see and notice more than you think. I have 5.", "Way too far to find this. It literally doesn\u2019t matter that Simon and husband share interests. So husband\u2019s point is that \u201cmy kids don\u2019t share my interests so why would I spend time with them?\u201d Well, because they\u2019re you\u2019re kids and you should be interested in them and their interests instead of yourself. Being around them is supposed to be the rewarding part, not getting to do a thing you like. It\u2019s not good parenting to throw your hands up and say \u201cI tried to engage them in my hobbies and interests instead of engaging in theirs and that\u2019s all I could\u2019ve done, I guess we don\u2019t spend time together. Oh well.\u201d \n\nIt also doesn\u2019t matter if Simon has any kind of developmental disorder. I\u2019m autistic, I\u2019m still not allowed to show up unannounced in my friend\u2019s homes and be rude to their spouses. That\u2019s not how that works. I\u2019m also not entitled to someone\u2019s time over their own children just because I might want it. NTA OP. Your husband and Simon are selfish and your kids, especially being that one is a minor, have a right to be upset with both of their behavior.\n\nEdit: Also Simon has a father. He works a lot, he didn\u2019t go out for milk and get a one way international ticket. He just works a lot. If my niece or nephew was being clingy with me like this my first call would be my sibling to say, \u201chey, Nibling is really struggling and clearly needs some extra attention. Is there anything I can do to help facilitate that so you can fit it in your schedule? I know you\u2019re busy but I\u2019m concerned and want to lend a hand.\u201d This dude just likes the attention and having someone share his hobbies, even if it\u2019s not in the interest of anyone involved", "Omg please stfu just because someone is introverted and has special interests doesn't mean they are autistic, this is an insult to both autistic people and people who aren't socially awar, grow up and stop diagnosing people over a reddit post and gaslighting their family into it", "I disagree the 16-year-old only sees dad for a specific number of hours a week, on the weekends Dad ignores his own son to hang out with one of two adult nephews.  I would be salty if I were his son to think I wasn't of value to my own father.  The problem is the husband made choices that his nephews were more a priority, more so now that their adults.\n\nThe boys father chose not to make them a priority or encourage them in any bonding activities.", "If we pretend that Simon isn't a relative and started off as, say, a coworker then Simon and Op's Husbands are just guys who are very close friends-- and that would be fine, great even. Having a very close friend who you click with and spend time with is wonderful and as long as other relationships aren't suffering because of it then there's no problem. \n\nBut... the other relationships are suffering and maybe it is or maybe it isn't because of Simon, but that's where the focus should lie. The point isn't to kick Simon out of Husband's life- the point is to prioritize his kids in a meaningful way (and maybe for Husband to support his wife a bit by requiring Simon to be polite to her and respect her boundaries).", "I will also say, after further review. That you can not force a relationship. Does your husband love your sons? I am sure he does, has he tried to get involved in things they enjoy? And even if he has done all those things, as I said, you can not force a relationship to happen. They are natural. So, while I absolutely get where you are coming from, even father and sons sometimes don't mesh when it comes to spending time together. The love being there is what matters. If there was some instance of him flat out ignoring them for his nephew, I would say there's something that needs to be addressed. Because it's not right to ignore others like that, but it doesn't seem that is the case from the post.", "You sound quite narcissistic too. You have a very negative attitude towards your younger nephew, based on superficial things like him not greeting you. You don\u2019t see anything positive in your husband caring for a nephew who has a somewhat absent father and perhaps struggles to connect with people. The relationship with your husband sounds like a huge positive to the young man\u2019s mental health. The conversation should be centered on making sure your sons\u2019 needs are met AND your husband can continue providing a support system for nephew, and anything you can help do to support nephew in becoming more independent for his own sake. If your nephew is able to grow emotionally and meet a partner, it will free up your husband.", "Lots of high functioning folks go undiagnosed. He follows a lot of the traits you have mentioned here.", "I guess it is possible that he is narcissistic and autistic. One doesn't exclude the other after all.", "That's the thing though, Simon has a lot of friends and he's close with his brother and seems good friends with his other cousins. I think he even had a girlfriend before and seems quite successful.\n\nSo I don't understand why he's attached himself so much to my husband. I know they have a lot in common but I find it weird how they always go out together alone and the way Simon always seems excited to see him or hug him.", "It was just the first thing that came to my mind, when I was not even through the first paragraph entirely.

He should make them feel supported and like they can rely on him.*\n\ncompletely agree  \nnta", "You\u2019re not wrong- what he\u2019s doing with his nephew is wonderful and probably facilitated by their common interests. Having said that, he needs to foster a relationship with his own sons, and at least pretend to care about their own interests. It sounds like he\u2019s approaching this as an either/or scenario, as opposed to embracing both his own children and his nephew.\n\nTo be fair, if he can\u2019t invest some time with your children, support them emotionally, and genuinely show an interest in them, the odds of them having a relationship in adulthood is fairly low. Why would they take time out of their lives to spend time with someone who effectively ignored them while they lived together and it was convenient? There is simply no incentive there. He could take your sons to dinner, sports events, teach them basic repairs on cars, etc. He\u2019s simply choosing not to, and that\u2019s a problem.\n\nYour nephew has no control over the situation and is clearly benefiting from your husband\u2019s involvement in his life. It wouldn\u2019t be prudent to cut your nephew out when it will only lead to resentment from your husband and his family, as well as likely negatively affecting your nephew. Instead, he should work on making the time he spends with all three more equitable. NTA.", "Other than forgetting the thing your son asked him to do, are there other examples of him not supporting your kids?", ">I just thought as a father he should take more interest even if he doesn't share all the interests with our sons.\n\nWhat activities are you sharing with your sons? When you tried to share your hobbies with your sons and they shut you down, how did you get them to come around?\n\nOh, none? You didn't? You only expected this from the parent with the penis? Sounds pretty sexist.", "She's been judging this dude as a weirdo since he was FIVE YEARS OLD, and she wonders why he doesn't like her?", "He doesn't turn them down, he just forgets when they've asked for things sometimes", "Oops, my mistake. I mixed the sons and nephews ages. So yes, that changes it significantly.", "How is he disrespectful or impolite? He didn't say those things to her face and her behavior does sound insufferable, she obviously doesn't like him or spending time with him, he and his cousins don't have any affinity, yet she keeps trying to force a relationship. It's not ok for him to tell anyone how he feels about her ever, but it's ok for her to call him narcissistic for not liking being harassed? Hell no.", "Nope I'm saying I knew reddit armchair psychologists would be claiming autism at the slightest hint of awkwardness. Because that's the type of braindead unnecessarily pathologizing comment that this sub defaults to.", "This is something I really resent about my own dad, but I only came to realise as an adult.\n\nYour kids aren\u2019t necessarily going to be into the same stuff as you, but if you value having a relationship with them you\u2019ve got to try and be interested in their stuff, at least while you\u2019re with them.", "Gosh, you\u2019re a huge snob.", "Did you read the elsewhere reply tho? Pathologizing, is defined as: \"unfairly or wrongly consider something or someone as a problem \\[...\\]\" by the cambridge dictionary.\n\nI disagree with the adjective problematic in this context. And the assumption autism is meant in a negative way is exactly that. Pathologizing it (unfairly considering something as a problem).", "I feel for you and your sons. Growing up the only way I could spend time with my dad is if it was something he wanted to do never anything I wanted because he wasn't interested in that. I'm now closing in on 40 and I can count on one hand with fingers left over the times my dad did something with me that I wanted to do. Needless to say we're not very close. \n\nAdult relationships are two way streets but not so with your children, that street is one way. It'll start to go both ways in the teenage years but only if the work has been put in during the earlier years. If he's shown no interest in their interests don't be surprised when the teenager and young adult have no interest in his. If he's shown no interest in their interests and mostly only spend time with some one else's son don't be surprised when they not only don't want to do what he wants but they actively start to resent him. If he wants to have a relationship with his own sons he needs to make the time to spend with them doing things they like.", ">he tried to spend time with our sons but they don't seem all that interested in doing what he likes doing\n\nI think the real problem here is that your husband seems to be interested in doing only things that entertain \\*him\\*. Are your sons interested in any activities? Because if they are, your husband, as their father, should involve himself in those. He seems pretty selfish to me.", "the comparison thing got my attention your husband along with his lectures.  His 16-year-old is his child, so he bonds with his nephew and his nephew wants to monopolize his time.  Your husband is the reason his kids don't want jack to do with him.  He treats them differently than their older nephews.", "Well seeing as autism is a disability, uh *yeah*, it's negative. I know there's this new fad where we pretend like autism is just liking things a lot and fidgeting and whatever. But it's a disability. It's disabling. As someone who's *actually* diagnosed, it's not a cutesy little tiktok fad. It's a damn disability.", "Agree 100%. I\u2019ve watched countless hours of anime, and played games I had little interest in, just to spend time with my kids. Now I have a daughter who somehow loves the NHL, and we watch way too much of it together (it\u2019s awesome). It\u2019s give and take, until something common comes along.", "The husband is more interested in focusing on himself and his hobbies than doing anything else. He's selfish and self-centered and is spending all of his free time on things only he likes. He could take an interest in his sons and their hobbies but spends most of his time focused on his buddy and their hobbies. \n\nBeing a parent doesn't mean your kids need to be your carbon copy to be interested in their lives. You are supposed to care about them and the things they do instead of trying to make them like your favorite stuff. I'm sure there are some things in common they could enjoy together if he ever bothered to spend time with them.", "Well same tho. ;P\n\nI just feel it is this way for me. The Autism (when speaking of the high functioning spectrum at least) is not what is disabling me. When I am left to my own devices. Only having to interact with the people I like. My day to day works very well.\n\nBut as soon as I have to interact with the grander structures of our society. Built by and for neurotypical people... I am disable to function properly in a world that expects me to be neurotypical *at all times.*\n\nTho, I do get that people with more severe symptoms can feel way different about this.\n\nAnyway. I guess I'll concede my point. As I realise this is very subjective from my part.\n\nThe only thing then still is: I didn't try to diagnose him. And maybe the takeaway should be arguing that \"problematic\" is not a good way to think of someone. And just leave the autism part out of it. Idunno.\n\nBut. TBH. I also do not see the harm. Maybe you can enlighten me, and acutally change my mind. Who knows :)", "Now why would the husband bring his son's on his dates with Simon?", "Are we forgetting that one is a grown man and the other is a 16 yo who in hs.  9/10 both have things going on that probably doesn't include the father. The wife is only starting to say these things after years of the father actually trying and being there for his sons. We taking the wife's words as end all of things. Just cuz he doesn't do everything with his kids doesn't mean he loves them less. If his nephew enjoys the same activities then let them be!!! The wife is trying to force something that happens naturally or doesn't. U can't make ppl hang out or enjoy the same things just cuz their family. If I like cars and guns and my child doesn't I can't make him enjoy it and to force him would make the experience terrible.", "Thank you! This is NTA.  It seems like OP's husband doesn't even TRY to engage with his sons. Or tried once and then threw up his hands and went \"oh well\". Especially as OP has commented that the older son used to have a good relationship with his dad but it's gone by the wayside. And he completely forgets anything related to youngest son.\n\nAnd sometimes it is easier with a niece or nephew because you aren't their parent so there isn't much discipline, only fun. So maybe that is why he finds things easier with Simon.", "You're assuming he'll even notice they aren't talking to him.  especially if the nephew is still comin' round.", "Hahaha just posted the same.", "Haha! Sadly that\u2019s true!", "You're right that he can't force the kid to be interested in what he's into.

Right now he's not doing anything to indicate that he's actually interested in the lives of his own children, and that will hurt them.", "i think the issue here seems to be that the husband chose to bond with the nephew over his own sons during their more formative years, and now its almost too late to even attempt to find a common interest. i know if my dad didnt even try to pretend to be interested in sharing any of my hobbies/interests with me (or even just hanging out watching movies or listening to music) and, instead, opted to spend real quality time with my cousin, I'd really feel some type of way about that. i wouldnt be willing to put in the effort to bond with him when i wasnt worth it to him when i was a kid.", "They weren\u2019t grown men when this started.  So what was his excuse then.", "True.", "I'm thinking this may be how the older son feels and younger son is getting the same message and taking the same route as the elder son.  \n\nI find it very strange that the KIDS are the ones that are expected to show an interest in dad's hobbies only.

A lot of videos games make me nauseous unfortunately. My husband gets on the server and plays with them. I grab him Minecraft Legos and shirts. I love actually building stuff in person with him more! Legos, marble runs, magnetic tiles are more my jam lol. Both our kids are in karate and we both go to every practice. We go home and help them spare.
