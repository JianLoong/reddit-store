He is doing to his younger son what his brother does to his nephew except his son doesn\u2019t have an uncle who he could bond.", "NTA\n\nI think there's a few things you are rightly upset about and things that, in my view, should change:\n\n* Simon barely acknowledges your presence and is impolite towards you and your sons. I think that's an issue IF he is coming yo YOUR home. I would talk to your husband about this and say that Simon needs to improve his attitude if he were to remain welcome at YOUR home. Simon doesn't have to become best buddies with you or your sons but he should behave in a polite manner which includes greeting you and your sons (if they are present), asking how you are doing, and replying if he is asked how he is doing. That's just manners and he should have them considering he is a grown man.\n* Your husband is neglecting his own kids in favour of spending time with Simon. I think that's an issue with regards to your younger son who is only 16 and still lives at home. Husband should show interest in what your youngest son is doing even if it's not his hobby or something he isn't interested in. It's called parenting. It sounds like the 16 year old is not very outdoorsy and maybe not so fit (complaining about the hiking trip), but maybe husband and him can find some kind of physical activity they both like (gym, (indoor) soccer, tennis, bouldering, or maybe something like snooker/pool/darts assuming a 16 year old is welcome there where you can do these things). I don't think you can force your husband to spend that much time with your 21 year old as he lives away for college, or does he still live at home? At that age most people have their own lives and possibly not that much interest in doing things with their parents. If your older son does ask for time with your husband and your husband refuses, then maybe it's time to talk to husband about this too.\n* I don't think you can stop husband from spending time with Simon, as long as husband doesn't neglect his own kids or you. If you are not comfortable with Simon being over at your house as much as he is, then that's another story. I can understand not wanting someone you don't like that much being around several days of the week. So if this bothers you, talk to your husband about it. What bothers you (is it Simon's rudeness, is it having a guest (any guest) at the house so often because you feel you can't freely enjoy the house then, etc).\n* Have you talked to both your sons about their relationship with their dad? Ask if they feel they can get as much time with husband if they want, whether husband is open to doing things THEY like or if husband says no to their suggested activities, etc.\n* I want to add that Simon shouldn't be coming over unannounced. This would bother me to no end no matter who it was, and more so when this is someone who barely acknowledges your existence.", "NTA\n\nHe is their father and should be making an effort to do what they are interested in not just what he wants to do. Not everyone is in to Hiking and killing animals for fun.\n\nKeep being pushy and overbearing until he spends time with his own boys.", "NAH. i get that you want your husband to spend more time with your sons, but if they themselves arent really bothered to reciprocate then how would he force it upon him. its a two-way street right, and looks like your husband isnt taking an interest in what both your sons are doing and vice verse for the sons. so its no wonder that he is spending more time with the kid who shares his interests. you arent an AH for wanting him to spend more time, but dont force it on him.", "For more context, since I couldn't type it in too much in the post.\n\nSimon is very close to my husband. He often comes over unannounced, gets annoyed if he sees my husbsnd isn't home alone and when I'm working, he and my husband go out to restaurants and other places.\n\nOne time I came home from work and saw Simon crying in my husband's arms and holding onto him desperately. Apparently one of his online friends died but the story seemed a bit inconsistent to me.\n\nI've always tried to be nice to him, offer him food and try to make conversation and jokes but he seems like he can't wait to get away from me. He doesn't talk to my younger son at all and only briefly with my older one, small talk about movies or their studies/work.", "Maybe your husband could schedule regular reminders to ask your sons to do things together, like go to a restaurant or events. If they refuse, well, okay, he should keep trying, because even if they don't or can't go, they will always remember Dad making the effort. Hopefully, you will also give him credit for that, regardless of whether it culminates in an activity or not, because it's not enjoyable to be rejected.\n\nIt must feel like a bit of a betrayal for your husband to be so connected to someone who openly dislikes you. That's understandable. His behavior is more TA in this situation. To your credit, though, you have conflicting feelings about it, recognizing that he is still a child. That being said, you deserve to be treated with respect, especially in your own home, when you've been kind to him. IMO, your husband should insist on this.", "NTA for wanting your husband to refocus his priority to his sons when it\u2019s lacking\u2026   \n\n\nBut\u2026 do his sons actually share interests with him? It sounds like Simon and your husband have a mutual appreciation for what they do, and your other sons aren\u2019t into that stuff. Is Simon the buddy your husband wants to hang with? Can you find something your sons and husband are both into and encourage them to spend time together on something mutually enjoyable?   \n\n\nAlso\u2026 does Simon have a neurodiversity? Maybe just pause in your dislike of his difference and ponder that. Everything you\u2019ve said about his social skills points to one. He might not have one, but it sounds like he might, and if he does then he\u2019s not actively excluding you (even if it feels like that, like he\u2019s intentionally rude)\u2026 he just has a different social language to yours and is a deep minority.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But YOUR attitude disturbs me the most (even disgusts me, in places) - albeit probably not for the reasons you think. Firstly though, there's nothing wrong with wanting your husband to spend more time with your sons (though have you checked if your sons actually WANT to - or is this just a 'you' issue?) \n\nIf your sons DO want it - then I agree that shouldn't just happen, if it happens to align with your husband's interests. Your husband should make more effort. But you seem hellbent on scapegoating Simon for it, and undermining the validity of his bond with your husband. Simon's NOT responsible for your husband's bond with your sons (Simon probably wouldn't get this attention either, if he didn't share interests with your husband). \n\nAnd I'm absolutely disgusted with your comment that Simon (at age 5) would say he wanted to marry your husband. You further say you've found Simon's attachment to your husband 'odd' since then. So what was your problem?! Were you concerned the 5-year-old was a threat to your marriage, because said 5-year-old wanted to be the 'other woman'?! Or are you trying to imply Simon currently wants to f*** your husband?! You are trying to abnormalise Simon in a revolting way, based on a NORMAL childhood comment. \n\nIndeed, research has shown how common (and normal) such sentiments are, in young children. I remember I used to say I wanted to marry my Grandmother. It's entirely innocent. It's because young children don't understand the differences between romantic/sexual love, vs. the familial love (that they feel for their attachment figures). Meanwhile, children are told people marry, because they 'love each other'. \n\nAnd since young children know they love their attachment figures, they simply assume that means they will marry them. It does NOT imply inappropriate or sexual feelings towards the adult. You only dropped that irrelevant detail in, to try to pathologise Simon's bond with your husband. But his attachment to your husband is HEALTHY, especially since his own Dad isn't very involved. \n\nSimon shouldn't be offhand with you, no. He MIGHT be an asshole for that. But who knows? Maybe he picked up at a young age, that you had a bizarre, jealous, and disapproving attitude towards him (and his bond with your husband). Maybe he would have bonded better with YOU, if he'd detected enough positivity towards him - and if he wasn't picking up vibes, you want to interfere with his relationship with his Uncle. \n\nIt might also be that Simon has some sort of disorder, which influences his behaviour. But you don't seem to consider that possibility. Plus, it's not even very relevant to the question in the post, that Simon doesn't talk to you much. Again, everything seems based on abnormalising/blaming Simon.", "YTA. Stop trying to destroy the relationship between Simon and your husband just because you don't like Simon.", "YTA. Most likely your husband\u2019s nephew sees him as a dad.", "ESH.  It very much sounds like the nephew could be autistic, but instead of thinking there could be some underlying reason for his behaviour, you have basically just labeled him as rude and left it at that. You are also dismissive of the fact that for much of his life, he has had an absentee father and your husband has at least tried to fill that role. Naturally, he is attached.\n\nYour husband is being an AH because he doesn\u2019t seem to think anything matters except for his own interests when it comes to your sons.  It is selfish of him to only want to spend time with the kids on his terms. Why cannot they do their hobbies of interests when he spends time with them? Why not go away on a weekend with just them (together or individually) doing something that they enjoy? The fact that he does these things with Simon and not them says a lot. And the fact that it\u2019s because it also overlaps with his interests is even worse - as if they are only worth spending time with if they do what he wants.  This is actually the real problem, not Simon.  Your husband needs to recognise this and address it.", "YTA\n\nPartly for trying to say he can't do stuff regarding shared interests with his nephew, but mostly for holding on to a comment made by a FIVE YEAR OLD for nineteen years so you could justify your bizarre jealousy.\n\nNews flash: five year old say weird shit and don't understand what marriage actually means.\n\nThe fact that you said that strongly suggests there's a lot of petty, petty shit you're leaving out of this.", "NTA\n\nYour husband and Simon like the same things, so it's easy to bond.

Otherwise, he'll be wondering why they make no effort with him in the future. That doesn't mean he can't still see Simon, but if he's directing all of his paternal energy onto Simon, that's a big problem.\n\nSimon's attitude towards you and your children is likely a result of jealousy from his side that he didn't get the father that your sons have.

He should have friends his own age especially now that he's in his 20s he shouldn't be relying on a father figure for all of his social needs.

My son remembers his dad\u2019s resentment towards him and my husband wishes nothing more than to go back in time and make more of an effort to take an interest in his sons hobbies and interests even though they were never anything he was ever interested in.

I wouldn't want to be put down in comparison to some other kid especially one who is 3 and 8 years older (looking at the age of the kids involved). If you are 10 and are doing some kind of skilled activity, of course a 13 or even 18 year old is going to be more skilled and take to it faster. The husband was so wrong in favouring his nephew over his own sons and for comparing his kids to Simon.

It's rude af.\n\nIf Simon sees you as a kind of competition (for attention from your husband), to me that shows that Simon has the wrong kind of idea about the relationship he and your husband have, probably from your husband spending so much time with Simon. Multiple people can be very close to someone in their life, and I am not saying a spouse should ALWAYS trump anyone else, but in the end you are your husband's life partner. Simon is a nephew, although he is more like a son and actually more THAN a son, to your husband (it seems). But I feel that based on your descriptions, there are boundaries that Simon crosses. Your husband is too close to Simon, so close that Simon feels he can just drop by whenever and can lay claim to your husband's time.\n\nHave you talked to your husband about boundaries with Simon? Don't tell husband that Simon can't come over or you don't want him to see Simon, but I would say that you feel that Simon acts like he basically lives at your house, coming over unannounced, expecting your husband to be home and spend a huge amount of time with him, etc. And tell husband how you feel about that.

It doesn\u2019t seem like he is willing to spend time with them doing things that they like.", "Hi, sorry but your husband is being an ahole to the kids you have together. He has neglected them and is still doing so. It's like Simon is his golden child when it's not even his own kid!\n\nThe current state is probably from years if not decades of your husband spending a lot of time, and favouring, Simon over his own kids. That's such a rubbish thing to do.\n\nIt's one thing to take Simon on and treat him as 'son-light' when Simon's father has been absent/less involved, but it's quite another thing to overcompensate for Simon's father's lack of effort/interest and take more of an interest in Simon than in his own kids.\n\nMaybe your sons would have developed more of an interest in their father's hobbies if your husband had put the same kind of effort and interest in including his own kids in his hobbies. Your sons may still have grown out of interest in your husband's hobbies but at least they would have a closer relationship from having been actively included as opposed to tagging along to an activity husband wants to do with Simon.\n\nYou need to have a real conversation with your husband about his behaviour, his favouritism, and how this has affected his own kids. It sounds like your older son has had to just accept this, and I guess it's not possible to go back in time and give him what he needed from his dad when he was 10 or 12 or 15 or 18, but your younger son is only 16 and struggling in school. That probably really eats away at his confidence. And then at home, his dad can't be arsed to take an interest in him because his dad is too busy with your son's cousin. Your husband is neglecting your teen son who probably really needs positive experiences with the adults in his life. I assume you try to be very involved with your younger son, but he also needs his dad. Mothers and fathers bring something different to the table and kids, ideally, would have both.\n\nMaybe this is something to talk about with a family therapist. If your husband refuses, you can at least go by yourself just to get a professional opinion on this situation.\n\nAre there other adult males in your/your younger son's life that you could involve move? If your husband isn't going to do it, maybe your son could form a closer bond with one or more of his uncles or a close, adult male friend you have?

As a mom to a teenage son, I had to learn about many things that weren't previously in my purview.

There is no point for all of them to go to activities they don't enjoy. Your sons don't love hunting. Don't make decisions for them and don't push it\n\n\nIn the beginning you said Simon shuts you down every time you make personal questions. Why do that when you are clearly not close with a person?\n\nThe problem I see here lies in the future if your husband isn't further involved in his sons' lives, there will be eventually only a formal relationship between them"]}
