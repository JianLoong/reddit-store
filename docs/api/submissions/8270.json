He was restless the whole time, and after a while they got him a snack. The problem is it had peanuts.\n\nI asked them if they could not eat peanuts right next to me and they explained he has autism and it\u2019s one of the few foods he likes and that he needs to eat to calm down, they were very sorry but they couldn\u2019t. \n\nMy friend who was with me offered to switch seats with me but it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway. I asked the couple again and they said no and it eventually escalated to where I raised my voice because I felt like they were disregarding my life. I had to leave and they gave me dirty looks on my way out. \n\nMy friend says I should\u2019ve just moved to a different seat(there were empty seats but I didn\u2019t think I should have to move because they were endangering me). \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1674683091, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lao3h/aita_for_asking_someone_to_not_eat_peanuts_next/", "score": 1100, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For this:\n\n>there were empty seats but I didn\u2019t think I should have to move because they were endangering me.\n\nYou\u2019d rather stand around near peanuts and bicker, and then huff off home instead of just moving. Why? And don\u2019t say \u2018it\u2019s the principle of it all.\u2019", "YTA. The peanuts he was eating were endangering you, but you weren't willing to move to an empty seat because why? You'd rather just leave and feel offended? How does this make sense?", "YTA. Your allergies are your responsibility. At a sporting event venue where they sell peanuts at the concession stands you should not be surprised when people are eating peanuts near you.", "YTA. How could you possibly be THAT entitled??", "YTA. You are responsible to protect YOURSELF, which you could have done by moving to any number of other seats. Instead, you repeatedly harassed that family because they wouldn\u2019t stop doing what they had every right to do.\n\n\u201cI raised my voice because I felt like they were disregarding my life.\u201d Get a grip.  You are not their responsibility. Their son IS. You caused 100% of your own trauma, and need to learn not to burden others by expecting accommodations wherever you go.  Many people, including several in my family, have deadly tree nut allergies. They advocate for themselves when ordering food, and when they were kids, there was a no nut policy at all of our houses.  Because we are a family. Family looks out for their own.  Nobody else carries that obligation, and you need to accept that.\n\nJust because your family accommodated your needs, all your life, doesn\u2019t mean the world has to. And it won\u2019t. You are accountable for harassing that family and making a scene. You ruined their time, and have no remorse about it.  Stop acting entitled.", "YTA. I have a peanut allergy. And it\u2019s very invasive and annoying. Sometimes I have to miss out on situations to protect myself. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for asking. But the fact you could\u2019ve found an empty seat and didn\u2019t makes you TA. And the fact you raised your voice\n\nEdited for spelling mistake!", "YTA - I'm sorry to hear about your food allergy, however the world won't stop spinning to keep you safe.  Asking once is fine, but they are perfectly within their rights to say no.  Especially given the reasons they provided.  At that point it's on you to remove yourself from a situation that you find dangerous.  ESPECIALLY since there were available seats that you easily could have moved to.\n\nAt some point you'll realize that not everything is about you, and people are not deliberately \"endangering\" you because they live their own lives.", "YTA. If there were empty seats, you should have moved.  You have a duty to protect your own life, you can't leave it entirely up to strangers.  Both you and the kid had special needs.  There was an obvious way to accommodate both, but you refused to take it.", "As someone who is also severely allergic to peanuts, YTA. Move? They can eat what they need to.

You can\u2019t dictate what other people eat in a public place.

Do you normally go out in public in a huge bubble that you forgot that day?", "YTA\nUnless there was a reason beyond \"you didn't think you should\" that you couldn't switch seats. \n\nYou're the asshole for expecting others to solve your problem when you had it within your power to solve it yourself.", "YTA. You were in a public place, they were absolutely within their rights, and rather than be slightly inconvenienced by moving somewhere else you yelled at them? Get over yourself.", "YTA. I have deadly allergies as well (eggs and shellfish) and avoid being around them... by moving. Is it considerate to be mindful of people's allergies? Of course! Is it reasonable to dig your heels in after someone apologised and let you know why they can't accommodate you the way you want? No. Asking wouldn't make you TA, but being stubborn and entitled, and refusing alternatives provided does.", "There were empty seats and you wouldn\u2019t move? YTA", "YTA.  If peanuts could kill you you'd have moved instantly to one of the empty seats far enough away.  Instead you chose to sit near the thing that could kill you arguing with people.

I say this as the mother to a child who has both autism and peanut allergies. So I can fully understand both disabilities. \n\nIt can be very challenging to arrange an outing for a child with autism, and challenging to find food that an autistic child will eat. They have as much right to be there as you do, and as you mentioned there were other seats available but you chose to leave instead of moving to another seat. Living with food allergies is very hard, as is parenting a child with autism. I have had to leave places due to an unsafe environment regarding food allergies around my son, and I\u2019ve had to leave places due to an autistic meltdown or being unable to feed him with available choices. It\u2019s unfortunately just the reality of both of these situations, and you learn to be as flexible as possible while also being safe and realizing that sometimes there\u2019s no good solution. In this instance, you decided that you\u2019d prefer not to make the situation safe and instead throw a tantrum and leave. That\u2019s what makes you TA.", "YTA. \n\nYour allergies are your responsibility.

It's insanely entitled of you to make it the problem for total strangers. The onus was on you to move.", "YTA your allergies isn\u2019t their problem.

Move their seats for YOUR allergies???\n\nMaybe you should take it up with the venue that sells them.", "> there were empty seats but I didn\u2019t think I should have to move because they were endangering me\n\nYTA - You have to protect yourself and had an opportunity to do so.", "YTA", "If this is the case than YTA but I highly doubt it because someone with a deadly allergy wouldn't stay and argue", "YTA. You should've switched seats with your friend, this was an event where people don't need to cater to others and yeah it sucks you have a sever allergy but you were making a fuss for no reason when your friend gave you a solution.

I'm allergic to getting hit by cars, they need to move around me on the highway because I'm standing on the road. That's what you sound like.", "YTA. Not for asking, but for escalating unnecessarily when you had other reasonable options.", "YTA. The kid has issues just like you do EXCEPT you have the autonomy to move your entitled arse away but he does not. If you are so seriously allergic that you can't sit next to someone eating them, why do you deliberately put yourself someplace that risks exposure, then demand that everyone around you take responsibility? If your allergy is that severe, you risk yourself by just sitting on seats where peanut eating people dropped food, touched surfaces with their contaminated fingers, and left crumbs. It seems to me that you just enjoy flexing on people, and expect all the special treatment when it concerns you, but don't give a moments thought about other people and their difficulties.", "YTA - this is your issue, not theirs.

If you're so concerned with your life, then you should have moved, not started yelling.", "YTA. Your allergies are just that: yours! It\u2019s actually quite irresponsible to not have a backup plan when you are *deathly* allergic to a very common food that people eat at sporting events. Also, you could\u2019ve moved! *You* put your life in danger.", "YTA- it\u2019s a public place, they bought their seats just like you bought yours. You can\u2019t control a peanut allergy and they can\u2019t control their child being autistic. Escalating to scream at a family isn\u2019t okay and that\u2019s what makes you TA", "YTA, empathetically.\n\nI can't even imagine how scary it must be to have a \"deathly allergy\", and it would be nice for people to have empathy for you and not eat peanuts near you. However, you cannot expect everyone toa accommodate. This is especially true at a large sporting event AND when a kid has autism and peanut snacks calm him. \n\nAsking was fine. But when they said \"no\", you should have taken steps to make yourself safe.  *By the way*, when you ask someone to do something and get irate when they say \"no\", it becomes a demand instead of a request.", "Grown up yells at small child instead of moving seats?

Check with the venue - they may have allergy safe sections like MLB stadiums do.", "YTA.  I hate the sound of chewing.  It creates white hot anger within me.   Should I ask people not to eat?

BTW, for you sunflower eaters, I wish upon you infected, puss filled canker sores.", "YTA.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this but your allergy is not other people\u2019s responsibility, unless they\u2019re maliciously trying to cause you harm, which wasn\u2019t the case. \n\nYou should\u2019ve changed seats and be done with it.", "YTA; you are responsible for arranging your safety in public. You should have moved", "> I didn\u2019t think I should have to move because they were endangering me\n\nWrong. YTA. You wouldn't have been endangered if *you* would have moved. Why do you think other people need to be inconvenienced because of *your* allergy? The 4 or 5 year old with autism can't have his peanuts to calm him because *your* issue is more important? That's some major entitlement.", "YTA, it's not their responsibility to manage your allergy. You were 100% wrong for not just moving away. You need more personal accountability", "Yes you are the allergy is yours therefore it's your job to avoid peanuts and asking a stranger to bend to your allergies is a complete ahole move and is one of the biggest problems in The United States weak whiners like you wanting other people to bow to you", "YTA. With you being this allergic to peanuts and then being sold at the event, yes, you are. It really sucks for you but you took a chance on going to a place where a known allergen for you is available. Other people are allowed to eat that allergen in the seats they paid for.", "Gentle YTA. \n\nI get it. I do. It's super frustrating, especially when you know the consequences. But unfortunately you are in charge of managing your allergies and no one else. You have to make the situation safe for yourself, not expect someone else to. Not even mentioning that it was likely far easier for you and your friend to move then for them to pack up their little one and change seats.", "YTA: The politely declined with a reasonable excuse.

Not everyone have to cater to you in public", "YTA.\n\nYou asked, they said no.  Full stop.  \n\n\"No\" is a complete sentence and you chose to escalate the situation knowing full well you could have moved to other seats.", "YTA\n\nSorry but that was a you problem, that you could have easily solved my moving to other open seats.", "YTA    and considering it was a stadium there were probably peanut shells everywhere. \n\nExpecting strangers to care about your allergy is entitled behavior, yelling at them was outrageous.", "YTA.  Other people are allowed to eat in public spaces.  If you truly are THAT allergic, you shouldn\u2019t go in spaces where they serve peanuts or people may be eating them. \n\nYou could have moved and chose not to.  It\u2019s not like you were confined on a plane or something.  You could have changed seats with your friend or moved to an open seat without a problem.  Instead, you tried to dictate what other people (a child with a disability of all people) can and can\u2019t eat.", "YTA. You asked, they said no. Period. You are responsible to keep yourself safe not the couple next to you. Seriously a sporting event? Where you know they probably have peanuts.

Sporting events are an extremely common place for peanuts to be around, it's your fault for not taking that into consideration", "YTA. They bought those seats, they can eat what they want.

So, because uou are allergic and don't want to move, every body should adhere to your whims?", "YTA. \n\nIt's common for everyone to be diagnosed with lots of issues, so yours doesn't trump theirs. \n\nYou were overly dramatic in choosing to leave instead of sitting in an empty seat.", "YTA the world doesn\u2019t revolve around your allergies.

Am I the AH because rather than simply move my seat I asked a 5yo autistic child to do without a food that brings them comfort?", "YTA\n\nIt isn't their responsibility to manage your allergy.

I have a severe food allergy too, so I understand how stressful it is when someone near you is eating something containing your allergen. But it's on us to sort out an accomodation and ensure our safety, particularly as adults. \n\nSome people may disagree, but I don't think you were the AH for initially asking if they could not eat the peanuts next to you. You can ask, and they can decline. You didn't know about that child's needs, and I personally wouldn't be upset by someone making this request. Some people may not like it, but I don't think it's a total AH move. If you had stopped there you wouldn't be posting on AITA, and the family probably wouldn't think twice about the interaction.\n\nIt's your behaviour after that imo makes you the AH. They said no, so it's now on you to figure out an accomodation. And there was an easy option available: move to an empty seat. You endangered yourself by not moving.

That is part of what makes YTA.\n\nThe other part is that if there were empty seats that you could move to, and they declined your request, you could have moved to other seats in order to protect yourself.

Autistic kids can't choose when to and not to be over stimulated or have melt downs. \nAutistic kids can't choose what their safe foods are... they are what they are. \n\nGrow. Up.", "YTA. I also am allergic to peanuts and carry an Epipen. I would have switched to other seats for the remainder of the game.", "**Take me out to the ballgame\nTake me out to the crowd\nBuy me some PEANUTS and Crackerjack**\n\nDude.  It's a sporting event.  Of course people are going to be eating peanuts.\n\nYTA", "YTA. The entire world doesn\u2019t owe you cause you have an allergy. If there were other seats this was completely unnecessary and no doubt that you\u2019re the AH.", "YTA, peanuts are expected at a sporting event.  Hell you can smell the peanuts going in to a stadium around here.  Just another snowflake trying to make themselves SPECIAL.", "You're lucky you didn't get a fat lip. Maybe next time you'll get an overprotective father that will use you as a life lesson.", "An autistic child vs an adult with a peanut allergy who can move without parental supervision.\n\nLOL YTA", "This is the hill you want to die on? Seems like you wanted a fight. A child with autism vs a grown ass adult\u2026 wow YTA", "YTA.  I'd start eating more peanuts.  The audacity for you to ask someone to stop eating in public.  Go home you entitled brat.", "I'm severely allergic to cigarette smoke. It sucks. If I breathe in just a small amount I will break out in hives around my mouth and it's this week long process of all the skin on and around my lips dying and flaking off and looking like I have a VD or have been in a desert for a month. I've even had full on asthma attacks because of it. And I'm usually stopped up for days following an exposure - and this is distant second hand smoke. It could kill me if I breathed in too much. \n\nThat said if someone is smoking I know I can't tell them to stop, and I generally just move. \n\nIt sucks but you should have moved. And don't yell around autistic kids. That's really shitty. You may have ruined sporting events for him forever. YTA.", "\"This os the hillI die on.\" Literally.\n\nEdit: YTA", "This is litterally the hill she wants to die on.", "If you don\u2019t care enough about your life to move, why should I?", "Not to mention the seat she was sitting in was probably covered in peanut oil from previous events", "Unless this person was touching the kids nuts they weren\u2019t in danger. You can\u2019t have an allergic reaction from the smell of peanuts\u2026", "Isn\u2019t it weird he/she was ok to be near them to argue and nothing happened while he was arguing for awhile? (Just wondering this thought popped into my head reading this)", "Makes me think they don't really have the allergy. They pretend to get attention.", "Agreed. OP needs to manage themselves around society. It's literally noone else's problem.", "Same. OP is TA. I've got a peanut allergy and there's places I don't go because I know it's not safe. No going to Five Guys, or Texas Roadhouse. Same for most sporting events. It's one thing to demand accomodations in an enclosed place like a plane or at work but I'm not going to make the same demand in a situation when I can make a minor adjustment like moving to a different car on the train or different seats at a concert.", "Plus autistic kids often have very strong food aversion and it can be next to impossible to find food for them to eat. This is not a case of someone who had lots of options and still chose to eat nuts around OP.", "My son is on the spectrum and for a long time, the only thing he would eat is peanut butter sandwiches.  A kid was placed in his classroom who is allergic to peanuts.  And while I sympathize with the child and the parents and the teachers, I could only send in the only other foods my kid would eat: Doritos-like nacho chips, fruit gummies, and animal crackers.  On several occasions the school sent home notes or brought it up to me in a conference about how he should eat something more healthy.  I agreed.  I also said *they* should have to find and provide him with the alternative foods or switch one of the kids to a different classroom.  I think if there is an allergy where there is a risk of death, and the risk of peanut exposure is so very high (like in a school), and the child would fare better in a regular classroom, then the school district should be providing all the food for the class to minimize exposure.  Not only are you asking every parent to police what their kids eat and brings to school, reading every label, and trusting them and the teachers, but you are trusting the kids as well to not sneak foods in, trade foods, or just flat out be messy and contaminate a surface.\n\nOP is an adult and while I sympathize, the kid also has a disability.  It may be unconventional that the peanuts calm him down, but she could have moved rather than the family with a child having to move.", "Yeah I might have understood if there was no place else to sit, like maybe the son could have switched with the parent furthest from OP, but damn op just wanted everyone to bend to their will", "She doesn't even have the moral high ground. A 4-5yo is not responsible for OPs health, OP is. It's her responsibility to take steps to not be around peanuts. And not for nothing, professional sporting events are the number one spot you'll find peanuts after some mid tier steakhouses that are littered with them.", "But DO they have the moral high ground? Ehhhh", "People can touch where peanuts have been and have a reaction, yes.  My niece has a life-threatening peanut allergy and she brings along wipes and wipes every table and chair arm down when she goes to restaurants for this reason.\n\nBut being \"near\" peanuts?  No.  Not unless someone was consuming -- I don't know -- a peanut powder that they were coughing into the air that would get on their skin or they could breathe in or something crazy like that.", "Meh, I have a friend who traveled with their son who reacted to being on a plane that had peanuts served *on an earlier flight*. Epi-pen, ER, the whole nine yards. It happens. But those people have learned to move away from people eating peanuts, and not stand there and argue. OP is a liar.", "Yep, our minor league team has peanut free nights.  Someone sitting a few seats down smuggled some one of those nights.  Before the game, I was talking to the family two rows in front of us, and they were telling me how excited the kids were because 2 of the 3 had nut allergies so it was their first baseball game.  So when I saw the guy with nuts, I pointed out that it was peanut free night and he was really rude about it, and refused to put them away, so I went to the lead usher (we know him).  \n\nHe was rude to the usher and refused to put the nuts away, so the assistant GM got called in, and he was rude to them, too.  So security was called, and he was disinvited from that game and banned for a couple for weeks (he had half season tickets).  He called me a b**ch.  Lol", "Yeah my son has autism and he has five meals he\u2019ll eat. Before he was diagnosed I used to get frustrated because his baby sister will eat anything, I thought he was just being picky, his #1 is peanut butter sandwiches, I don\u2019t bring him places he we can\u2019t bring our own food into because most places don\u2019t sell what he\u2019ll eat", "Five Guys as well.", "I imagine it\u2019s more a psychogenic response to the scent or sight, especially if they\u2019ve had a serious reaction in the past. Doctors could do a much better job of educating people about what can happen.", "One thing I will say in defence of school bans (talking for youngest end of school here) is children with allergies sometimes don't understand just how serious they are...even up to around age 9 I have come across children who have been told they can't eat things because it will make them ill, trying them from friends lunch boxes because they feel left out and everyone else gets to have it...I'm put in mind if a celiac child who projectile vomited all over the classroom for this very reason.\n\nSchools cannot have eyes on a child constantly (even with one on one) and so I do understand why bans are put in place. \n\nHowever I also understand how frustrating it is at the same time", "Agreed.  It\u2019s anxiety of what it can do to you.  I\u2019ve heard people feel nauseous when they smell them but I think that\u2019s a fear response", "There is a billboard near where I live that says \"Please text and drive\" sponsored by the local funeral parlor.", "Im stealing this \ud83d\udc80", "This is when I think it's obvious that the person is exaggerating how \"in danger\" they were.  If they truly were in danger of having a life-threatening reaction, then they would have moved no matter what.", "Sorta like \"They stood their ground until the very end\"?\n\nIt'd be an epic epitaph.", "My niece grew up in a school without a ban.  But they had a special \"peanut allergy\" table in the lunchroom.\n\nUnfortunately, she was the only child at her lunch period that had a peanut allergy.  So she ate all by herself.  Poor thing.", " we should start a club, I never met anyone else with it either!", "Yeah, I have a violent GI reaction to chocolate and if I\u2019m somewhere the scent is really strong (like a bakery where they\u2019re actively making a batch of chocolate something or a candy shop that makes fresh fudge) I get extremely nauseous. My mind was literally blown when my doctor told me the smell wasn\u2019t actually triggering my allergy. It sure triggers my \u201cflight\u201d response though!", "Omfg that is absolutely savage \ud83d\ude02", "In my country's capital city, billboards are strewn along major highways that say \"Don't jaywalk. Someone already died here\". Really morbid but it does get the message across (pun intended)", "seems like the better option would be a room or table for people WITH peanut stuff - kids with allergies don't feel excluded, and you know what surfaces should be extra clean", "Our bodies and minds are pretty wild !", "Right? I was like OMG this is genius \ud83d\ude02", "The problem with that is you are relying on children to know whether their lunch has peanuts or not.  And from my understanding people with peanut allergies have to be careful of things that are not obviously peanuts because some snacks might contain small amounts of peanut dust because of cross contamination in factories and such.  So a child might think their lunch is peanut free when in fact their granola bar or snack cake might be a potential threat."]}
