If she was staff, you'd be well within your rights to complain about her spoiling the experience you'd paid for.  If she was another customer, she should have minded her own business.", "NTA. You were at an all you can eat buffet. Eat as much as you want. That woman was being an asshole.", "NTA. She was being a busy body. The whole point of buffets is so that people can pig out a little.", "NTA - she was just being nosy. It's an all you can eat buffet, eat as much as you want", "NTA. A buffet is set up so you can take as much of what you want as you want. You would be the AH if you took the entire tray of eggs or bacon, but taking even large portions isn't wrong. The staff should be monitoring the buffet line and prepping the next trays once it starts to get low. Once the new tray is ready they'll bring it out. Minimal wait times. While I'm impressed at the amount you managed to put away, they are all of very easy to replenish items. The lady was just being nosy and bossy.", "I think what's even more weird is if they were just another patron at the buffet staring at you eating, while you're just another paying customer like everyone else at the buffet?

It will profit on some and lose on others, the staff will get paid and it is their job to cook. Unless you were taking entire tray pans of food, you weren\u2019t going to make a dent in their workload. \n\nThe woman whether she worked there or not, I\u2019m thinking she didn\u2019t, had no reason to insert herself into your life.", "NTA\n\nJudgers gonna judge.", "NTA.

The main parts of AYCE etiquette I'd say are not taking far more than you can actually eat and wasting it and taking way too much of something leaving little to none for other patrons (if it's the last of something fair enough, but emptying half a tray of an item that won't be refilled quickly is diskish). \n\nIt's an AYCE buffet. Yes, some people will 'locust' their food.", "NTA You at least made it right and always went to get what you want, not stuffed your plate and then let half go to waste.

You paid for your meal just like her which included all you can eat.
