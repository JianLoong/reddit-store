{"id": 7474, "submission_id": "10ddzk8", "title": "AITA for wanting to move into my daughter's old room to avoid falling asleep on the couch?", "selftext": "My (56M) daughter (27F, Amy) moved in with her boyfriend after finishing college and law school. They broke up earlier this year and she moved back to our home. My wife now lives permanently in another state because of her job as a hotel manager so it is just Amy and me here at the house. The master bedroom I used to share with my wife is the biggest in the house and has a private bathroom as well as a big walk-in closet that is now basically empty after my wife took most of her clothes with her.\n\nAmy said her mom had given her permission to take over the closet and that therefore it would be more practical if she just fully took the whole room because otherwise I would have to leave every time she is changing there. The options were for me to go to my daughter's room or to the guest room. I would have preferred to take Amy's room because it is bigger, albeit not as big as mine, and has its own computer and TV. Amy convinced me to take the guest room because she says her childhood bedroom is a very emotional place for her in an intimate way and wouldn't want for me to change it.\n\nShe argued that I can just watch TV on the living room and use the computer on my office, or my laptop anywhere, then just go to the guest room for sleeping. I also could watch stuff in my tablet or phone while I am at the guest room. The guest room is really small as it is just has a bed and a closet. I don't remember that we ever had a guest staying there.\n\nThe issue is that as I tried to avoid going there until the last minute at night I have started to fall asleep on the couch a lot and that has gave me significant pains on my back. Sometimes Amy sees that I am sleeping there and wakes me up to take me to the guest room but other times she does not notice. I have tried to discuss again the idea of me taking over her old room but she is not open to it at all.\n\nMy wife thinks the notion of me falling asleep on the couch by accident because I tried to avoid going to the guest room is very childish and not a problem to be taken seriously. I have been trying to argue for this but Amy becames annoyed when I bring up the subject and I am afraid that if I insist too much on this she is going to feel unwelcome at the house.\n\nAm I the Asshole?", "created_utc": 1673874063, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ddzk8/aita_for_wanting_to_move_into_my_daughters_old/", "score": 423, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

For her to not discuss things with your, but with your wife and tell you their decision, that's wrong.

She wants her old bedroom for herself, and she wants your bedroom for herself, and for you to cram yourself into the smallest space.

Maybe she could use the guestroom closet for her extra stuff, or sort out her things and just use the available space in her old room and put the rest in storage.
