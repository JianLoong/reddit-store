Recently I called to confirm a upcoming scheduled appointment with my regular doctor and was told she was sick and would be out for a bit. I understood obviously and asked what date would be good for reschedule, I was informed she wouldn\u2019t have another spot for a little over a month and if that was too far out for me I could schedule with a different doctor. \n\nI of course asked who would be able to fit me in and the only doctor available was a male. I declined and said I did not feel comfortable with a male doctor and informed the rep on the phone that if possible to just schedule me for my regular doctors first available appointment.\n\nThe nurse(rep) on the other end started to explain that the male doctor had appointments available and that I NEEDED to pick one of his open dates or I wouldn\u2019t get in AT ALL. I again informed her I did not feel comfortable with a male doctor and I explained I understood he was a professional but for personal reasons I wanted a female doctor or just to put me down for my regular doctor. \n\nAt this point I felt like I was being pressured to book with him and the nurse was getting very nasty. So I threatened to call the state medical board and report them for being unethical and unprofessional.

At that moment I felt pressure to accept the appointment with the male doctor, even though I was politely declining and willing to wait a month, even though I was never notified that my appointment would be pushed back or rescheduled. I believe that in itself is very unprofessional with the added on pressure to a sense change.
