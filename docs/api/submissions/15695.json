They got engaged in 2020, but are having the wedding now after waiting a few years to save up.\n\nSara really has become a part of our family, and she and I developed a nice friendship. She and Mark have also been really excited about the wedding up until maybe 2-3 months ago, which is to be expected as the big day looms closer. Now, they're both stressed say that they wish they had just eloped to save all this money and headache.\n\nWe had Sara's bachelorette party over the weekend. It was myself, Sara, and two of Sara's longtime friends who are also in the wedding party. We were having a nice time at a restaurant when Sara started talking about how much she regrets deciding to have this wedding in the first place.\n\nThen, she said that the only reason that they're having a wedding is because my brother's family (my family) would \"never have gotten over it\" if they'd eloped. I protested a bit, at first feeling bad that she felt pressured by my family into something that she didn't want to do but also reassured her that my family would have been perfectly fine if they hadn't had a wedding.\n\nSara then kind of laughed and looked at me and said: \"Do you really think that your mom would have gotten over it if her firstborn son decided to *elope*?\" I said that she absolutely would have gotten over it and pointed out that my parents also eloped. Sara then turned to the others and said, \"she's wrong, their mom would have hated me forever for marrying her son without a wedding, and Mark could never bear letting his mommy down anyway.\"\n\nI admin that my mom can be a bit over the top when it comes to events and such, but she's stayed out of the wedding planning entirely, on purpose. I told Sara that she was wrong and told her to stop blaming my family for a decision that she made.\n\nThings got awkward after that. We all sipped our drinks for a minute before Sara and her maid of honor got up to go to the bathroom together, leaving me and the other bridesmaid at the table.\n\nThe other bridesmaid (\"Lily\") then turned to me and told me that it was super rude of me to call Sara out in front of her friends just days before her wedding. I stood my ground and said that I wouldn't let me family be blamed for something that isn't their fault. Lily insisted that maybe I don't \"know the full story\" and that I could never understand how Sara is feeling, so I shouldn't add stress to her life while she needs to vent. No one else spoke to me for the rest of the night. Things were a bit better in the morning, but everything still feels awkward, and Sara has been distant since then.\n\nNow I'm wondering if I overreacted and if I should have just let her vent. I wouldn't want to be called out in front of my friends like that, but I also felt a little cornered and that it was my job to stand up for my family.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682456117, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yvrg1/aita_for_snapping_at_my_sisterinlaw_in_front_of/", "score": 149, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's silly and pathetic to blame them for your choices. \n\nThey say you \"don't know the full story\" you don't need to know anything to defend those you love.", "NTA. She wanted you to sit silently while she badmouthed your family. The \u201cMark could never bear letting his mommy down\u201d comment is very dismissive of her fianc\u00e9.", "NTA. Sara seemed to want to play the victim. You pointed out that she is not. An honest refutation is much kinder than a sarcastic, \"Awwwww, poor you!\" Her efforts to make your family the people victimizing her failed, so *your* comments became what victimizes her. I hope this doesn't become a pattern with her.", "NTA\n\nif she was venting privately on the phone and you overheard and called her out, then i could understand why she would be upset. but she\u2019s venting about her fianc\u00e9\u2019s family, which includes you! you weren\u2019t rude and you didn\u2019t overreact. i think she was being rude about your mom. and if there\u2019s more info to add to get the \u201cfull story\u201d, why didn\u2019t she share that part? my guess is because there isn\u2019t anything else to add. Sara sounds like drama. as you mentioned, you two get along well, so hopefully this is just stemming from wedding stress.", "NTA, you called her out on her bad mouthing your family. That being said this will directly impact your relationship and yes there may indeed be things you don't know about (as per what Lily said) so it may be worth pulling Sara aside and talking to her about it with an open mind", "NTA. What did anyone expect? Talking crsp about your in-laws...in front of your SIL?...Just bad taste.", "NTA. Did she think you would just sit there while she belittled your brother and mother? I think you did a good job refuting her snide remarks. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s just the stress causing her to be so obnoxious.", "On one hand I can understand you reacting to someone bad mouthing your family.\n\nOn the other hand\u2026 was she right? Let\u2019s be honest here. Don\u2019t lie to Reddit. We deserve the truth \ud83d\ude09", "NTA why is she venting like that when you are right there. She\u2019s welcome to her struggles but I can\u2019t imagine trashing someone\u2019s family in front of a member of said family.", "NTA - sounds like Sara has some harbored resentment over something, and that's her problem, not yours.\n\nIt was good you stood up for your family. There's a difference between venting and verbally bashing.", "Before this silliness boils over more say something to mom or brother about the conversation. I can guarantee you she\u2019s going to eventually throw you under the bus for \u201cbeing mean to her\u201d.", "NTA. She started blaming people who weren't there to defend themselves, so you did. She's a liar, and will not take responsibility for her own decisions. Too late to warn your brother.", "I think you should have just let it go.", "NTA. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. She decided to speak poorly about your family in front of you, and then played the victim card when she was called out. Who cares if it's her wedding in a few days? If she is telling the truth (which it sounds like she isn't) she doesn't care about the wedding anyway!", "NTA - Sounds like Sarah needs to grow up a little and take ownership of her own choices in life. She has no one to blame but herself for her situation.", "I\u2019m leaning NAH.\n\nMy SO and I will be eloping in the near-future and we know beyond all reasonable doubt that my F-ILs will never let us live it down, despite it being a mutual decision to avoid the unholy interferences they will inevitably be making if we don\u2019t elope without them knowing when and where.\n\nI also know that my SO\u2019s little sister, who is nice, will vehemently excuse and defend their actions even when they insult me right in front of her. So my SO and I don\u2019t say anything to her to avoid hearing her proclaim that two adults \u201cjust understood parents wrong!\u201d and the blatant insults they just gave me were actually \u201cjust family joking around!\u201d \n \nSara likely has grievances with your parents that you are unaware of, and I can\u2019t fault her for airing them *while tipsy, to her friends, at her own bachelorette*. I can\u2019t quite fault you for defending your family either. But I would advise you to speak to her about it privately if you want a relationship going forward.", "NTA\nBeing stressed about the wedding doesn't give her an excuse to speak poorly about your family. I would do worse if someone did that to my mom. You're fine. \nAnd she needs to grow up!", "I understand feeling the need to defend your family but instead of dismissing what she was saying out of hand, you could have and should have asked her for examples of how/when she felt pressured by someone or where she got that idea.\n\nShe may have been looking for support. She also could have explained instead of just generally throwing your mom under the bus. Try and remember your relationship with your mom is not her relationship.\n\nNAH", "NTA... BUT, it did seem like you were a little quick to take umbrage over a small comment, and therefore turned a offhand statement into a conversation that went further than it was meant.  The original comment might have had some truth to it.  She sounds stressed and there might be pieces to this puzzle you are not aware of.  Perhaps this is the picture your brother is painting of his/your mom and he has made comments on how excited she is for the wedding... or would be to see him get married (in previous discussions about the possibility of eloping).  Even he or his/your mom made only subtle comments, she might feel like it would let her or your brother down and she wants to support her husband.  People vent and they are human.  I understand the reaction to want to defend your family, but unless she is saying something truly terrible (E.g., bullying, racist, homophobic, etc.), maybe give a little grace in the moment.  If it is still bothering you later, you could chat one-on-one and ask what she meant by the comment and how it made you feel.  In some cases, I might say otherwise.  For example, if you knew someone to already be mean or not like you or your family, you would have cause to have your guard up.  It sounds like, in general, she likes you, you like her, she likes your family, and your family likes her.  In the past, giving others the benefit of the doubt and talking about it later has given me perspective I didn't have at the time; making me glad I tried to see the best in the person.", "NTA, I imagine I would have done the same in your situation. However, I will say that my sister felt pressured the way that Sara seems to have described and it\u2019s definitely possible that things are happening that you are not seeing.  Tbh it may not be directly your mom and maybe it\u2019s things that Mark is saying to her. That was the case with my sister. It was more that her husband was saying that his family would hold it against them if they eloped. It could be totally off base but I figured I\u2019d share in case there were similarities in situations.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll get over it, but she definitely should not have brought it up like that bc if I were you I would feel cornered too.", "Mild YTA - Sara\u2019s feelings are hers - regardless of how you believe your family would have reacted, she has her reasons for feeling differently \n\nWhile you were within your rights to defend your family, in the interest of not making her bachelorette awkward and about the elopement question, a \u201cthat\u2019s not how I think it would have gone down but hopefully we all have the best time on the big day\u201d or something along those lines may have been more helpful", "YTA. There was no need to respond to her first comment. She was making a casual remark about being stressed, the topic likely would have moved past it if you hadn't engaged her.\n\n1) The wedding was in a couple of days, so eloping was for all intents and purposes off the table. 2) You aren't the spokesperson for your entire family, and regardless of whether your parents eloped that doesn't mean they would want to miss seeing their son's ceremony. 3) You don't know the specifics of her relationship with your parents, what they've said/implied to her or your brother.", "YTA. She obviously feels that way because it\u2019s what your brother has told her. You were rude and wrong. YTA.", "NTA. Well, you don't \"know the full story\" because she never bothered to tell you and just prefered to play the victim. Maybe your brother came up with the idea of having a wedding instead of eloping because your parents never had a wedding, and she assumed your mom was pressuring him behind the scenes for that reason. Or who knows? But she (or anyone else for that matter) can't say you don't know the full story if you're not told the full story.", "NTA\n\nYour future SIL just doesn\u2019t want to take any accountability for moving forward with a big wedding now that its stressing her out.
