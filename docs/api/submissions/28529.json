The place isn't hugely popular, but we live in a small town, so there are a lot of locals who enjoy our food. My girlfriend has recently been going down a rabbit hole of ghost/supernatural related content, like podcasts and YouTube videos. She's always been a bit spiritual, and I don't mind that at all. Unfortunately, she seems more paranoid about this than passionate, which is why I'm concerned. She's been avoiding anything even remotely related to evil spirits or ghosts in general, and she's been keeping all kinds of rocks and salt and herbs to prevent any \"evil\" from entering the house. While I've been a bit concerned, I haven't been mad at her for it, since it didn't affect our daily lives too much. However, things went downhill. Over the weekend, I decided to go to the restaurant to do some interior design, since she'd been complaining about the place being too boring. I put up some mirrors, put some lights outside on the patio, and some LED lights for the bar. I called her to come down to the restaurant, hoping to surprise her with the new and improved interior. At first, she looked really excited to see the place so decorated, then her face fell. She looked over at me and started yelling at me about how I'd put the mirrors facing each other, and how that created a vortex or something. She was screaming about how ghosts are probably already haunting the place. She looked like she was on the verge of tears. I tried to comfort her, but she stormed out of the place, sprinting for her car to drive back to our house. I felt bad, and took the mirrors down from the wall. She was very quiet the next few days, until she eventually started talking to me again like nothing happened. I feel like I need to confront her about this, but I'm not sure how, or if I'm even qualified to do it without just being a douche.
