You had a meeting and your mother informed you. You do know what\u2019s happening with the property. Are you upset that your brother knew first?", "Who legally inherited the properties?\n\nHer?

It may well be that you have no legal rights here and your mother was truthful when she said she was just keeping you in the loop out of respect.  If your mother inherited everything, then it's hers, not yours, and you're not entitled to anything. So that would make you TA.", "YTA. They are not your father's properties anymore. Your mother is in charge of them, and she is entitled to do what she wants with them. Why do I get the impression that when you decided \"together,\" your mum felt railroaded into agreeing with your decision and is now just doing what she wants.", "Because we are currently in a similar situation that turned out very, very bad: NTA. Especially keeping one kid updated and then starting to cry because you ask for the same information your brother got rubs me in a very wrong way. Is there a possibility that your mother and brother \"scheme\" something behind your back?", "Technically, my brother and I inhereted everything, my mother and my father had separated assets. But their marriage contract made my mother usufructuary (not sure of the translation), therefore she is the one choosing what to do with my father belongings. \n\nWe initially decided to sell and split the money, 1/3 each, but she finally wanted to keep the extra revenue", "Mom has involved the children in the decision-making. \n\nThey deserve to be kept in the loop.", "I wasn't clear enough apparently : my brother and I are the souls inheritants, but due to my mom and my dad marriage contract, she is the usufructuary (still hoping it's the correct word), so she is the one making the decision, but the belongings are mine and my brother's only", "I think you may have that wrong, usufruct is the right to use and income derived, not the right to choose what happens to property.", "Speak to a lawyer, but generally an usufruct is the right to derive an income from an asset (usually property).\n\nSo what I think happened is that your dad left you and your brother the property, so that your mother couldn't sell it and waste the money, or to protect it against other relatives being left it in the future by your mum.\n\nBUT gave her the right to the rental income for life, so that she had a secure income.\n\nSoft YTA, for getting upset about something that you didn't understand, with a possible ESH, for no one actually explaining this to you", "If you are the heir, then you need to be informed about your properties and the cry of your mother is just manipulation, like the other person said,  go to a lawyer before everything disappear", "So if there\u2019s a contract saying she got the property, then she got the property. You and your brother technically got nothing.", "If your mother has the usufruct, that means she uses the property and gets the income from it for the dureation of the usufruct. So selling it would absolutely not be the right thing for her to do, because it would cut off her rights.  You only get it after her usufruct expires.  You wanting her to sell that property is you trying to terminate her usufruct and take the sales proceeds for yourself.  This is why she's so upset, she feels like you're trying to cheat her, you doofus. Go apologize.", "At least over here, usufructary means you get income from assets, it doesn\u2019t mean you get to decide what happens to them.\n\nI guess this is why everyone is so confused.", "Assuming she\u2019s within her legal rights then YTA. \n\nA usufruct often has the rights to enjoy the asset. It\u2019s usually for the life of the asset and/or her life. Upon liquidation she may not have those rights. Her decision to not sell it enables her to enjoy the asset (rental income or live in there etc). She\u2019s not obligated to tell you. \n\nUnless there is an obligation to tell you legally, YTA.", "I just don't know how to explain it in english \ud83d\ude43", "No : she didn't, my brother and I did\n\nShe is not the owner, but there was a contract that made her the one deciding what happens to the properties she doesn't own", "I don't care if we sell it or not, that wasn't the point of the post. \n\nI was wandering if I was right to say I wanted to be informed of the decision. \n\nWe originally wanted to sell because prices are currently high in that area, which is a rural one, but renting prices are low, plus the charges she has to pay are quite expensives. But she indees decided to keep the extra revenus. \n\nI get it, it's logical in a way, but I wanted to be informed od the change of plans", "Even if you say \u201cFruchtgenuss\u201d (are you german?), the same thing applies. You keep saying that this means that your mom gets to decide, but that is not the meaning of the term.\n\nSo either you are mistaken, or you have to try to explain how and why your mom gets to choose what happens to the assets which you you have inherited.", "I think you mean something like a tutor because you and your brother are minors???", "If she decides what happens to them, she\u2019s the owner lol", "NAH. Your mother is doing what she thinks is best and you have the right to be informed about her decisions at the same time as your brother. You need to get legal advice.", "I'm very confused by your post OP but I assume you mean your father left the properties in trust so that your mother could live in them until she died if she so wished and then you and your sibling would be able to sell them once your mother had passed away. If so it would make sense that she tell you she didn't wish to sell especially if she doesn't get any money from them but no need to fall out over it.", "You should add to the post that she doesn't own the properties.", "No.\n\nThat's a type of marriage contract that has been created to protect the remaining spouse from being evicted by the children while still giving everything to the kids. \n\nIt's mostly for the main property, but it takes everything in.\n\nTo give you a more clear idea : my brother and I are the owner of the family house our parents were living in, but as long as my mother doesn't agree to sell it (because she lives in), we can't sell it, even if the property is under our names", "Yes, that\u2019s pretty normal. But how or why would that extend to other assets?"]}
