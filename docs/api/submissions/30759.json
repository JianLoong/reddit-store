It gives her rights to rent, and to derive other income from it, none of which is in question here. \n\nOP is clearly confused about their mom's reaction to the question, and upset because there was a meeting, a decision was made, and then overturned \\_without informing OP\\_. \n\nMom sounds like a piece of work, this all stinks of something fishy going on in the background.", "Indeed she receive the rent money, but we agreed to split the sell of the appartment 33% each", "bro, that's not even the fucking point. op literally said they don't care. they are upset about being left out of the loop of a property they *own*", "\n\n>Unless there is an obligation to tell you\n\nop is the property owner with their brother. yes, they are entitled to know what decisions are being made with their property", "It's called \"not all countries have the same legal system\"", "She inherited the charges, it was the clearest translation I came up with to say she was the usufructuary. \n\nBut my bro and I are the owners", "True, and that\u2019s why in another comment I asked which country .. it\u2019s all very vague.\n\nWhat I do not believe is that, as OP keeps saying, it entitles the spouse to decisions re: what will happen with the property (= ownership), especially for assets/property other than the house the parents lived in.", "Are you in France? La nue-propri\u00e9t\u00e9 peut \u00eatre vendue, ind\u00e9pendamment de l\u2019usufruitier qui garde la jouissance du bien. Comme un changement de propri\u00e9taire pour un locataire.", "Are you sure she hasn't sold it? And the tears are tears of guilt knowing what she's done to your inheritance? Maybe ask your brother a few more questions. She may not have the right to sell it, but he does.", "Until they are granted control over the property they arent entitled to that info as the mother stated.\n\nMorally i consider it a toss up. If you dont have control and claim not to care one way or the other like op has then imo you arent ENTITLED to that info.\n\n\nThe more op talks about the topic the more it comes off like a pissing match on their end and at worst op trying to strong arm the mother into giving up the income and protections established by the late husband", "She didnt sell so it doesnt matter\n\n\nDoesnt seem the kids can sell without her approval\u2026.. which means they dont have control over the property\n\n\nIts not that confusing. Immediately post death she is overwhelmed bu the new responsibility of the properties and doesnt want to deal with it after just losing a spouse\u2026. No sale gets made since they cant evict a tenent anyway\n\n\nNOW she is opting to keep it and op is angry because they really wanted her to sell\u2026.. a decisions that is objectively detrimental to her financially speaking and would undermine what the husband had set up before he passed.\n\n\nIt sounds like op is pressuring real hard for the sale to get their share of the money before mom passes which is when they would get the right to sell", "\u2026 that\u2019s an answer to the wrong question. The right question is: what is the legal situation and what is she entitled to, legally? Then:  an you even change that? In some countries, you can\u2019t simply \u201cagree\u201d on a split separate from what is legally required, and this is to prevent pressure and abuse in such situations.\n\nMaybe if you told us the country it would be a bit easier \u2026", "I\u2019m not a lawyer but as OP said, the mom  is the usufruct. Idk the exact legal language of the contracts in place, but those rights should be spelled out there. In wealth management, those contracts usually only give ownership to children to help avoid stupidity or taxes and keeps all decision powers to the surviving spouse. \n\nIn other words, ownership is only one factor. It all depends on the contracts OP mentions. \n\nAlso, those contracts may not stipulate telling both sons. It seems the other brother knew and is okay with it. She may have fulfilled her obligation.", "Looks like that's working out great for this trio", "If Mom is entitled to the income, she would have the right to quell any sale I would think, based on what others wrote.\n\nThis is really a lawyer question though. If OP is unhappy with how the estate is being handled, paying a lawyer a bit to find out would be the way to go.", "I think they are european. Here there is an institute best described as right to use. It varies from country to country but essentially you can have a right to use the property but not own it. Depending of the country selling it might require consent from the holder of the right, or like in my country the right of use remains even after the sale and the new owner takes on the proprerty with rhe right of use intact, so essentially you cannot sell without agreement with the holder of the right.", "you clearly don't grasp what op is saying", "that doesn't make op and asshole for feeling entitled to know what decisions are being made regarding the property.", "Yes, but the question is, why does the mom usufruct rights not only to the place of residence but everything else as well. I get that OP mentioned a contract but it\u2019s all so very vague.", "It sounds like she's a form of a trustee. And the properties are in trust for you and your brother.\n\nRegardless, if the three of you made a joint decision, it would've been considerate of her to inform you if she unilaterally changed the decision. Maybe you came on too strong when you complained about not being informed of the change. Maybe she's just super sensitive to even mild confrontations. But I don't think you did anything wrong. \n\n\"...\\[she said\\] she was just keeping in the loop out of respect\"\n\nBut she didn't keep you in the loop. That's the point, right?", "If it takes everything in, then it takes everything in. If she has the power to sell the property, she owns it lol\n\nIf she can\u2019t legally sell it, then she broke the law. Feel free to take her to court over it", "It\u2019s pretty simple. You can\u2019t legally sell something if you don\u2019t own it lol. So unless this is some backwards, Wild West country, she\u2019d have to prove ownership to sell", "Naw, he def is TA assuming the previously mentioned legal roles. He feels entitled to something he\u2019s not entitled to, literally. That makes him YTA.", "\n\n>Usufruct is the right to use and benefit from a property, while the ownership of which belongs to another person.", "And she can\u2019t legally sell the property then lol. Not without permission from the owners.  So either OPs mom is the owner, she committed a crime, or OP didn\u2019t legally have to be a part of the decision. No matter how you cut it, he\u2019s handling the situation incorrectly", "op isn't even trying to force a property sale, so this is all irrelevant. they literally said they do not care. all they want is to be informed of the decisions regarding a property they legally own. once again, you clearly do not grasp what ops issue is. op also states there is a contract in place, so its likely that while mom isn't an owner, she must agree with the sale in order for op and their brother to sell it."]}
