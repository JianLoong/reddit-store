Your mother can thank the way she handled integrating the children in her marriage for how \"well\" you two got along. And your not caring about her stepson is not about being \"cruel\" to her.", "NTA, your family sucks.\nBut can I ask, if your stepbrother got your room, then did you get moved to another room? And if so, why didn\u2019t he just get that room?", "You better be careful.  He obviously has more game than you.  He will still your gf and the dog will be his as well then lol.  Just kidding.  Of course you are NTA.", "NTA it\u2019s always so sad when parents subject their kids to abusive homes... and then take the abusers side. Tell your mom to ask Andrew how Kate is.

She is currently favouring her stepson to be in good books with her husband, however the moment she'll be alone or in need then she'll crawl back and remind you what all \"Responsibilities\" you have as a son, don't bulge in at that time.

Said step-brother proceeded to spend the interim period mocking and bullying you undeterred by either parent, and then fucked your girlfriend...and your mother is shocked you don't love him?\n\nI'm curious...was your mother dropped on her head as a child? Does she have early onset dementia? Or, is she perhaps just woefully oblivious to anything that doesn't conveniently support her delusions?\n\n>She then screamed about how I'm a disgrace and called me a disappointment, saying I shouldn't be 'so cruel' to her.\n\nThe catholic church should start eyeballing you for blessed status for the obvious saintly disposition you displayed when you didn't laugh at her, tell her that she was an absolute travesty of an excuse for a mother, and hang up on her.\n\nIt sounds like your mother deserves actual cruelty as opposed to just being dismissive of her bullshit.\n\nNTA", "I don\u2019t know you or the dog but I love you both than your asshat of a \u201cstepbrother \u201c", "I haven't met either of them but I prefer your girlfriend's dog over them too.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nA woman who made you give up your room and sleep on the couch is in no position to be calling anyone cruel\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot to mention, he was awful to you as well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also prefer your girlfriend's dog, who I am sure is lovely.", "NTA my man.
