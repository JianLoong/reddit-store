My mother and I have a complicated but very loving relationship. She is always very supportive, but one issue is, she often shares information about me with family, friends, and online without my consent. Sometimes she just shares things without asking (stuff that most would ask if they can tell others) and sometimes she shares things even when I ask her not to. Because of this I\u2019m careful about what I tell her. \n\nWhile looking at the house and making an offer she asked to see pictures so I sent the Zillow link (which was not the wisest of decisions on my part). I later found out she showed my whole family the link, including the price. I later asked her to just show screenshots of the house without the link, so people don\u2019t know how much we are spending. She agreed. Then once we closed on the house I received a message from my cousin that she had posted screenshots of the Zillow link on her public Facebook profile, which showed the address both in the screenshot and where she wrote the full address again in the comments. \n\nI got really stressed (I have experienced identity theft before) and called her and asked her to take it down. I saw that it had been up for 8 hours and panicked and started yelling at her about how dangerous it was and a breach of my privacy. She agreed to take it down. \n\nNow with some time and space, I feel really guilty about raising my voice and expressing so much anger towards her. \n\nMy husband wanted to focus on celebrating the purchase last night and did not think we had too much to worry about.

If a child understands this an adult definitely can", "NTA.\n\nI highly suggest you go to a couple of these realtor sites, redfin, Zillow, etc (basically any website that lists your house), create a log in, claim the house, and remove the listing photos.\n\nSuper easy to do, just Google \"how to remove WEBSITE NAME photos\" :)", "NTA it should be common sense not to put personal information online, *especially* information that's not yours and had no permission to post. (really, she could have just texted them and not posted it? Do people forget texting is a thing?)", "Are you kidding me?? Bruh if you posted my address online im going nuclear full scorched earth and we are never speaking again i dont care who you are \n\nNot only are you very much NTA the fact that you even think you might be is deeply concerning", "NTA. She is completely in the wrong posting your personal information online and your reaction was appropriate", "NtA that is very dangerous. I find if hilarious that the generation that taught us stranger danger doesn't understand that the internet is almost all strangers. \n\nI would sit her down and explain some boundaries and then explain that other important parts of your life won't be shared until she can learn how to properly share good news for just safety: vacations, children, expensive presents you got. All information that can be used for nefarious reasons. Who knows who else she is sharing this info with? Her hair dresser? The lady who lives nextdoor?", "NTA. Your privacy should be respected and at worst it could be potentially dangerous and best a major inconvenience if you have people drop by that you don\u2019t want. Your mother seems very naive in the dangers that putting personal information on the internet can present.", "I think ESH. First of all, you need to let go of being mad that your mom shared the Zillow link to the family. Everyone was going to find out how much you paid for it anyway. When anyone I know buys a new house I immediately look it up on Zillow myself and I\u2019m pretty sure anyone who says they doesn\u2019t is lying. The price is public record and there was never going to be any way to keep it secret. \n\nYou do have good reason to be annoyed at your mom for sharing the address publicly on Facebook. But there was no reason to start yelling at her about it right out of the gate. You could have just calmly explained and asked her to take it down; if she didn\u2019t, then you could have escalated to yelling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You know she can't be trusted.", "On Day One of Social Media 101 they tell you to never ever EVER post your address or phone number or any other personal identifying information. Mom is old enough to understand why that is and remember not to do it. NTA. Sometimes we can't hear clearly unless the volume is turned up.", "ESH \n\nFeels a bit like an over reaction on your part. You can look up like 95% of people on the internet and find their address. The Zillow link was basically public information. You can look up house purchase prices online throught tax records as well. No one is going to steal your identity just by knowing your address.  After you expressed concern the first time your mother should have checked with you before sharing information.", "ESH sharing the zillow link isn't that weird. I look up what my friends houses - it's pretty common\n\nBut you also know your mom doesn't keep things to herself and you keep sharing info with her.", "It's info diet time. OP, don't tell your mother anything you don't want posted online from now on. She's repeatedly boundary stomped, and posting everything online is dangerous, especially on a public account. If you and hubby want kids and tell her about a pregnancy, she'll immediately start posting it on FB before you have the chance to announce the pregnancy yourself. You're going through something and don't want the world to know? She'll post it. \n\nI think you also need to address hubby's passive attitude towards it. He can be calm about it because he isn't the one who had to deal with the brunt of it, and the idea of \"the risk is minimal so it's fine\" is just so nonsensical. I said it in another post to a teenager, but apparently both hubby and mom need to learn that risk is a numbers game. The internet exposes you to more people, and some of those people are going to have bad intentions. There was a story of an influencer who took a picture in front of a window in her house and someone doxxed her based on a tree she had in her yard and by using street view photos to  confirm it was hers by the decoration visible from the windows. Don't post something online that you aren't okay with a stalker or your worst enemy seeing"]}
