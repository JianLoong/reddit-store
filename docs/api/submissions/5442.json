You can look up like 95% of people on the internet and find their address. The Zillow link was basically public information. You can look up house purchase prices online throught tax records as well.

OP, don't tell your mother anything you don't want posted online from now on. She's repeatedly boundary stomped, and posting everything online is dangerous, especially on a public account. If you and hubby want kids and tell her about a pregnancy, she'll immediately start posting it on FB before you have the chance to announce the pregnancy yourself. You're going through something and don't want the world to know? She'll post it. \n\nI think you also need to address hubby's passive attitude towards it. He can be calm about it because he isn't the one who had to deal with the brunt of it, and the idea of \"the risk is minimal so it's fine\" is just so nonsensical. I said it in another post to a teenager, but apparently both hubby and mom need to learn that risk is a numbers game. The internet exposes you to more people, and some of those people are going to have bad intentions. There was a story of an influencer who took a picture in front of a window in her house and someone doxxed her based on a tree she had in her yard and by using street view photos to  confirm it was hers by the decoration visible from the windows.

Everyone does. \n\nESH. You majorly over reacted.", "NTA and your mother should not have posted your address without your permission but just in general you should also be aware that in many states in the US (if you are in the US) real estate sales are public, and if someone owns property you can find their full address just from googling their name", "NTA, after a history of invading your privacy and airing your personal business online, your mother has now doxed you.

I think many parents or older folks don\u2019t seem to understand the internet that well. They don\u2019t understand how sharing is not limited to the people they think they are sharing with. \n\nAs another comment said, do not share anything with your Mother that you do not want posted online. She can\u2019t seem to respect that boundary. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about your address being posted online, the address was posted on the real estate site and was likely accessed by many people prior to it becoming your home. If you think anyone you know would break into your home then that\u2019s a different issue you should address. \n\nI think you reacted appropriately in the scenario because you felt violated but it would worthwhile to sit down with your Mom and explain the internet, your feelings, and set a boundary moving forward. And tell her that you will limit contact and it will negatively affect your relationship if she cannot respect your boundaries.", "NTA \n\nWho in thier right mind thinks it's acceptable to blast someone's address across social media. Having experienced stalking TWICE, I would have been livid too. \n\nHopefully your Mother will learn something about respecting privacy but I wouldn't hold your breath. \n\nIt's a shame you can't just share exciting news like this freely with her without worrying she'll blurt the most intimate facts to the world. It's awful to feel like you constantly have to be on your guard, especially with someone you should be able to trust implicitly.", "NTA, this is your information to share or not as you choose.

All these people saying that posting the address online is dangerous. I was sending out holiday cards last week and was able to find addresses online for all but one of my friends with very little effort, and I'm not some kind of investigative genius.

I get that OP's mom should have respected her request not to share the information, but if OP is going to be upset about information being online, she needs to direct this anger at people other than just her mom.", "I agree. Even just pictures and even descriptions are easily traceable. I knew someone that bought a house last year, I found it on Zillow and Redfin just by the description and general area. My family did the same when we bought a house and I posted a picture of the front of the house. I can pull up tax records for any property by finding the local GIS. It\u2019s all public information, if you know where to look.", "I had to scroll a long way to get to this comment. In the state that I live in anyone can search property tax records by owners name.

Once you use the internet, you have to understand that your anonymity and privacy is gone. Most of us turn a blind eye towards this or do not fully appreciate what it means. Zillow is a public website, and once anyone knows your address, they can look up the price etc. There are even other sites that give much more info.\n\nYes, you were harsh on your mom who is simply bragging to all about her child's achievement. That is what parents do!!! \n\nContinue to speak to her about your expectations for her giving out info.

Identity theft, doxxing, the house being broken into, scam contractors seeing the link or the equivalent are really common while random child abduction was not.\n\nBut people get wildly defensive when you accuse them of being stupid and unsafe because humans like to believe only other people do things that make them \u2018targets.\u2019 Scams and cons thrive on the shame of not wanting to admit you fell for it.

She definitely doesn\u2019t want to admit she is also untrustworthy, rude, invasive and kind of old fashioned.\n\nAn info diet is best or if possible go old school with her. Take your photos with your phone like normal and then use one of the free print sites and give her physical copies. You are so excited to share mom! But it\u2019s really hard for boundary stompers with poor digital hygiene to overshare widely when it is a Kodak moment photo, a handwritten card etc. I have found this an incredibly useful way to block this behaviour while not getting into fights about banning them from stuff like knowing your whole address. It really helps you dictate the narrative by side stepping and giving your husband the side eye before he moves to the suburbs and starts some shit like \u2018oh you don\u2019t need to lock your doors here!\u2019\n\nHe has no excuse but deal with mom and set some boundaries with him while you are at it.

Mom just dropped all that information in people\u2019s laps.\n\nIt\u2019s like how you wouldn\u2019t leave your front door wide open when you leave for the day or you wouldn\u2019t leave your wallet in an unlocked car \u2014 people can try to steal your stuff at any time, but why make it easy for them?", "Yup, very true. I found someone\u2019s address just by browsing without even knowing their street name or what their house looked like, just the neighborhood.", "There\u2019s no reason to open the door even wider for bad actors. Without that post from mom people wouldn\u2019t even know that OP had moved. The information may have technically been out there already but mom just pointed a flashing neon sign at it.", "But it\u2019s okay for anyone who has access to the moms page and doesn\u2019t know op\u2019s real name to get their address", "NTA\n\nThe risk is pretty minimal, but not non-existent. I'm sure it will be fine, but I wouldn't want my address being shared on someone's public social media and would be pretty furious at anyone that did.\n\nThe way you have written this, it sound like she isn't doing it on purpose, but that she is very oblivious. Is it something where you can sit her down and explain to her exactly why her actions are a problem?\n\nEnjoy your new home!", "NTA\n\nAlso, from now on, consider anything you tell or share with your mother to be information that will absolutely be shared publicly. She obviously has no boundaries; therefore, you need to have strong boundaries.", "NTA, she went against your wishes. Don't tell her anything. Whenever she asks say \"I can't say since you'd post it online. Maybe someday you'll earn back my trust.\"", "NTA.", "I think there's is not a massive risk. But I also feel like yelling about somebody just randomly posting your address online is completely okay. NTA", "NTA. Her linking it on a public social media profile after you asked her not even to share the link amongst family is so disrespectful and out of line. Her commenting your address is absolutely unhinged. Time for a total information fast for her- obviously the diet isn't working.", "NTA. I had to do some courses on computer security for a job I had. 8 hours on internet is ETERNITY. Buy cameras for your property and install a good alarm. I'm so sorry, I don't mean to alarm you but better safe than sorry.", "NTA... even though anyone could just google your address it wasnt cool of her to literally write your address in the post. A screenshot accidentally revealing too much info is one thing, but she sealed the deal by reiterating your address.\n\nShe would make me not want to give her anymore info, like ever. And Im pretty sure your husband is just being a good sport even though he knows your mom crossed the line. I think he even understands it was a breach, but what's done is done.", "NAH. You asked your mom not to show the price of your house; you didn't ask not to show the price OR the address. It is reasonable that you were upset and stressed about this, since your mom did something that you considered a breach of privacy. It is reasonable that your husband wasn't so worried and wanted to celebrate a monumental day. It is reasonable that your mom didn't realize that you wouldn't want the address publicly shared-- thoughtless, for sure, but not asshole behavior. \n\nI do think you should apologize to your mother. Say that you were stressed but you shouldn't have yelled at her, especially since she agreed to take the post down as soon as you asked. Say that you wish she'd ask you before posting anything about you publicly (and explain that facebook is public).", "NTA but you need to stop sharing info with your mother. When she asks why tell her it's because she doesn't respect your privacy", "I empathize with you completely. When my husband and I were buying our house, I stupidly sent my sil the Zillow link. She blabbed at a family event within a week home much we paid. I was just like.... Really? It was both tacky and not her business. I agree with the info diet comments. She's clearly going to share anything you show or tell her.", "NTA. This is unsafe", "YTA for giving the info...why would you do that", "Total AH you could have taken screenshots and sent them to your mom, moms aren\u2019t great with technology, she agreed with everything you said but didn\u2019t figure out the crop, she wasn\u2019t trying to go against your will she never disagreed", "Yes, all of that info is public record. Including the sales price.", "Lol I can only imagine how many of these commenters would react to a phone book.", "I surely don't do that why would I look up how much someone paid for their house its not to my business", "I have sat down with her before and explained that in general I would like her to ask me before sharing life information online or with family because there have been issues in the past (i.e. she told the mailman when I got my period lolz). She agreed and it did improve for a little bit, but recently it has been escalating again. Which I understand needs to be a conversation, yelling is not okay. I do genuinely believe she does not intend to hurt me, and I need to improve what I share.", "What does cropping have to do with doubling down and sharing the address AGAIN in the comments? She had to sit there and consciously transcribe it.", "Then post your address with a verification post of you standing outside.", "This argument is bogus. Of course there is an issue. You're basically saying that there is no difference between one vulnerability and multiple vulnerabilities. \n\nThe only thing that matters is, OP isn't comfortable with sharing this information online and she explicitly said so.\n\nAlso what you're saying means OP isn't protected from targeted attack. (I'm not from US so I have no clue if you're right) But do you believe there are no attacks of opportunity? OP's mom publicly sharing this information can bring OP to somebody's attention. OP's mom is risking a lot for no valid reason.   \nNTA", "Depends on the context it's being posted in", "Yes but if they\u2019re posted by your blabbermouth, over sharing mother they probably also on the same source find her maiden name, yours, your birthday, purchasing history, childhood pets names, holiday plans (if/when you\u2019re gonna be out of town and for how long) your children, their names, age- likely figure out their new school district and the the list goes on.\n\nYes you can google addresses and listings and all that but google\u2019s got nothing on a yenta mom.\n\nNTA- she posted your information without your permission. Doesn\u2019t matter there are other ways someone can find that information it\u2019s not hers to share and sharing it without your consent violates your trust.\n\nNTA", "LOL at people downvoting you thinking you're a \"scummy hacker\" type when all of this is readily available and they're just too lazy to go find it themselves.", "Doxxed her in the same way ElonsJet doxxes Elon, not really.", "If someone wants to have OPs address, they enter it in Google, pay the $5 or whatever dollars and sign up for one of the x number of services available, and not only get her new address, but also the last 5 from x years ago additionally to that, and those of her relatives, and her social media profiles, and her public record information like court cases, etc\n\nIt\u2019s *that* simple sadly.", "\u2018I\u2019m so happy my kid is finally getting her overseas anniversary trip for 2 weeks leaving saturday. Here\u2019s their address, pics, sale price btw\u2019 \n\n\u2018Oh look my nice Nigerian prince friend liked my post\u2019", "And if someone wanted to break into your car, they could do it pretty easily, but that doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t lock the doors. Posting personal information on social media isn\u2019t revealing things people couldn\u2019t find if they looked for it; it\u2019s revealing things they probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered to look for. When someone wants to commit a crime, they usually choose the easiest target, and someone who\u2019s private information is right there in their newsfeed is going to be a much more convenient target than someone you need to search online.", "And I pay money to services to specifically make sure that information is not available on me, someone like OP's mom completely negates that", "As a matter of fact where I live there is currently an increase in car break ins, and I know plenty of people who *leave their car doors open* for precisely that reason: because they feel that if someone wants to get in their car, they will either way, and if they leave the doors open at least they don\u2019t have to worry about replacing broken windows. Obviously that means not leaving anything valuable in the car to steal.", "Who is Facebook friends with her mom without knowing OPs name? That makes 0 sense. For one they could just look into the moms friend list, *if* they did not know her name to begin with since they know the family.", "Wow, the point of that metaphor went right over your head, didn\u2019t it? Amazing.", "\u2026I\u2019m fairly certain that\u2019s not typical most places. I\u2019ve done more than my fair share of moving, and at least everywhere I\u2019ve been, the neighborhood groups (whatever apps they used) always got regular posts reminding people to lock their cars because someone had forgotten and their ______ was stolen. Folks would just walk through the neighborhood trying doors and emptying out any car that was left unlocked; breaking into a locked car was very rare. Most criminals choose the convenient target.\n\nRegardless, even if you don\u2019t consider car break-ins (or not-break-ins?) to be the best analogy, I\u2019m not sure what downside there would be to NOT handing out that information on social media. No one\u2019s going to break OP\u2019s house by googling for their property records, so OP isn\u2019t increasing the risk of a worse outcome by not sharing their personal details on social media. Why make it easier for people? Why make oneself a target when they could just\u2026not?", "To clarify her Facebook was set to public, anyone on or off Facebook could see, not just her friends."]}
