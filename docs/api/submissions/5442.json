My mother and I have a complicated but very loving relationship. She is always very supportive, but one issue is, she often shares information about me with family, friends, and online without my consent.

Because of this I\u2019m careful about what I tell her. \n\nWhile looking at the house and making an offer she asked to see pictures so I sent the Zillow link (which was not the wisest of decisions on my part). I later found out she showed my whole family the link, including the price. I later asked her to just show screenshots of the house without the link, so people don\u2019t know how much we are spending. She agreed. Then once we closed on the house I received a message from my cousin that she had posted screenshots of the Zillow link on her public Facebook profile, which showed the address both in the screenshot and where she wrote the full address again in the comments. \n\nI got really stressed (I have experienced identity theft before) and called her and asked her to take it down.

You know she can't be trusted.", "On Day One of Social Media 101 they tell you to never ever EVER post your address or phone number or any other personal identifying information. Mom is old enough to understand why that is and remember not to do it. NTA. Sometimes we can't hear clearly unless the volume is turned up.", "ESH \n\nFeels a bit like an over reaction on your part. You can look up like 95% of people on the internet and find their address. The Zillow link was basically public information. You can look up house purchase prices online throught tax records as well. No one is going to steal your identity just by knowing your address.  After you expressed concern the first time your mother should have checked with you before sharing information.", "ESH sharing the zillow link isn't that weird. I look up what my friends houses - it's pretty common\n\nBut you also know your mom doesn't keep things to herself and you keep sharing info with her.", "It's info diet time. OP, don't tell your mother anything you don't want posted online from now on. She's repeatedly boundary stomped, and posting everything online is dangerous, especially on a public account. If you and hubby want kids and tell her about a pregnancy, she'll immediately start posting it on FB before you have the chance to announce the pregnancy yourself. You're going through something and don't want the world to know? She'll post it. \n\nI think you also need to address hubby's passive attitude towards it. He can be calm about it because he isn't the one who had to deal with the brunt of it, and the idea of \"the risk is minimal so it's fine\" is just so nonsensical. I said it in another post to a teenager, but apparently both hubby and mom need to learn that risk is a numbers game. The internet exposes you to more people, and some of those people are going to have bad intentions. There was a story of an influencer who took a picture in front of a window in her house and someone doxxed her based on a tree she had in her yard and by using street view photos to  confirm it was hers by the decoration visible from the windows. Don't post something online that you aren't okay with a stalker or your worst enemy seeing", "NTA that\u2019s a breech of trust. However, you know your address is public information, right? It\u2019s easily searchable on your city\u2019s appraisal district by owner name.", "Hate to break it to you, but property records are public information. You do not have anonymity anymore now that you are a home owner. Be prepared to get all sorts of official looking scammy junk mail trying to sell you title insurance and other things like that. It's not because your mom posted your address, it's because anyone can look that up in the city or county records. \n\nAnything on Zillow is also public and I'm sure your friends and family will look when you eventually give out the address (when they want to send you mail or visit you). Everyone does. \n\nESH. You majorly over reacted.", "NTA and your mother should not have posted your address without your permission but just in general you should also be aware that in many states in the US (if you are in the US) real estate sales are public, and if someone owns property you can find their full address just from googling their name", "NTA, after a history of invading your privacy and airing your personal business online, your mother has now doxed you. You need to decide whether or not you want to keep a relationship with someone who doesn't care about your safety", "NTA You Have Underreacted.", "NTA but I mean, your mother regularly violates your privacy and shares information like this by your own admission, so I\u2019m not entirely sure what you thought would happen here. \n\nPeople don\u2019t usually just change, expecting her to finally listen was kind of naive.", "Well, I\u2019m just gonna come right out and say it: stop sharing information with her. My mothers was that way too. She shared with me that my sis was having money issues, so I suggested a financial advisor might help. Next thing I know sis tells me to mind my own business and I\u2019m the AH, not my mom for sharing. Last time my sis ever spoke to me", "NTA. I think many parents or older folks don\u2019t seem to understand the internet that well. They don\u2019t understand how sharing is not limited to the people they think they are sharing with. \n\nAs another comment said, do not share anything with your Mother that you do not want posted online. She can\u2019t seem to respect that boundary. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about your address being posted online, the address was posted on the real estate site and was likely accessed by many people prior to it becoming your home. If you think anyone you know would break into your home then that\u2019s a different issue you should address. \n\nI think you reacted appropriately in the scenario because you felt violated but it would worthwhile to sit down with your Mom and explain the internet, your feelings, and set a boundary moving forward. And tell her that you will limit contact and it will negatively affect your relationship if she cannot respect your boundaries.", "NTA \n\nWho in thier right mind thinks it's acceptable to blast someone's address across social media. Having experienced stalking TWICE, I would have been livid too. \n\nHopefully your Mother will learn something about respecting privacy but I wouldn't hold your breath. \n\nIt's a shame you can't just share exciting news like this freely with her without worrying she'll blurt the most intimate facts to the world. It's awful to feel like you constantly have to be on your guard, especially with someone you should be able to trust implicitly.", "NTA, this is your information to share or not as you choose.  That said, this is all public information.  Any number of websites will happily report your address pretty much as soon as the deed is registered.", "YTA, all of this is public information.

If someone really wanted to stalk her they wouldn\u2019t need her mom\u2019s Facebook post to do it.\n\nMy friend was visiting me from out of state and when I went to text her my address she said \u201coh I already have it, I googled it.\u201d It\u2019s really that simple", "Finally,  a rational reaction!  All these people saying that posting the address online is dangerous. I was sending out holiday cards last week and was able to find addresses online for all but one of my friends with very little effort, and I'm not some kind of investigative genius. Do people not realize how much of this information is already online? I get that OP's mom should have respected her request not to share the information, but if OP is going to be upset about information being online, she needs to direct this anger at people other than just her mom.", "I agree. Even just pictures and even descriptions are easily traceable. I knew someone that bought a house last year, I found it on Zillow and Redfin just by the description and general area. My family did the same when we bought a house and I posted a picture of the front of the house. I can pull up tax records for any property by finding the local GIS. It\u2019s all public information, if you know where to look.", "I had to scroll a long way to get to this comment. In the state that I live in anyone can search property tax records by owners name. Even \"famous\" people if they are dumb enough to buy property with their real names. \n\nI won't even post vacation pics on fb while I am on the vacation because my actual name is on my profile and it is just basically announcing my house is empty.", "I say NTA bc she didn\u2019t give her mom permission but associating posting addresses online with being dangerous is a bit of a stretch. Addresses are public information and if someone owns property in most states in the US, if not all, you just need to Google the person\u2019s name and their address will come up. Or you could get it from the city hall.\n\nOne of my friends was visiting me from out of state and when I texted her my address she said \u201coh I don\u2019t need it, I already googled it and found it myself.\u201d It\u2019s really that easy", "I agree NTA, I don't think anyone should post things about you without asking.  But also, isn't it public information anyway? When you close on a house it's published in the newspaper who bought it and how much was paid for it. Tax/property records show your name and address online as well. I also Google a person's name if I don't have their address handy and it usually pops right up.", "Bot", "Comment stolen from u/Hermiona1\n\nReport - spam - harmful bots", "People if they wanted could find out from places but the same time if the mom is offering up all the info in one place.", " I posted a picture of the front of the house.", "It's a one stop shop - she'll also have posted her maiden name, their first pet and what street they used to live on.", "Do people really not remember white pages (phone books)? YTA", "You have a loving relationship with your mom who is understandably elated that you have achieved this milestone. She wants to shout it from the roofs and hilltops. She is so very proud of you.\n\nUnfortunately, it is incredibly easy to get information about people on the internet. Once you use the internet, you have to understand that your anonymity and privacy is gone. Most of us turn a blind eye towards this or do not fully appreciate what it means. Zillow is a public website, and once anyone knows your address, they can look up the price etc. There are even other sites that give much more info.\n\nYes, you were harsh on your mom who is simply bragging to all about her child's achievement. That is what parents do!!! \n\nContinue to speak to her about your expectations for her giving out info. Also, you should understand that if you do not want her to overshare, then you must do your part by nor giving out information to her.\n\nCongrats on the purchase of your new house.", "NTA. That's exactly the kind of thing I teach students to not do (home address, not that college students are buying houses) when teaching them to not do stupid things online.", "NTA, how dare they. Jeez, the ignorance.", "Your mother's behaviour is stupid for exactly the reasons you specify. Moreover she shouldn't be sharing your private information with other people without consent. NTA.", "Your mother and your husband are too old to not know better. This is just ridiculous.", "NTA.\n\nI started having people knocking on my door of the home I own, wanting to take a tour-WTF!\n\nSomebody had pulled the address from Zillow after I had bought the house and was trying to rent it.\n\nNope, identity theft is real (sadly, I have other stories) and your paranoia is not being paranoid.", "Your mother is Gen X to the lowest possible age of Boomer if you are 29. I\u2019m 44 so there is no damned way your mother didn\u2019t know about \u2018stranger danger\u2019 and not writing your kid\u2019s name on their schoolbag or clothes to prevent weird shit.\n\nShe just hasn\u2019t copped on or refuses to realise the internet is one big \u2018OP\u2019s name on her schoolbag for strange men to ask if she would like to see a puppy\u2019 but actually more likely to happen. Identity theft, doxxing, the house being broken into, scam contractors seeing the link or the equivalent are really common while random child abduction was not.\n\nBut people get wildly defensive when you accuse them of being stupid and unsafe because humans like to believe only other people do things that make them \u2018targets.\u2019 Scams and cons thrive on the shame of not wanting to admit you fell for it. And your mom is all shame and defensive she is yes, stupid enough to *post your address online deliberately*. She definitely doesn\u2019t want to admit she is also untrustworthy, rude, invasive and kind of old fashioned.\n\nAn info diet is best or if possible go old school with her. Take your photos with your phone like normal and then use one of the free print sites and give her physical copies. You are so excited to share mom! But it\u2019s really hard for boundary stompers with poor digital hygiene to overshare widely when it is a Kodak moment photo, a handwritten card etc. I have found this an incredibly useful way to block this behaviour while not getting into fights about banning them from stuff like knowing your whole address. It really helps you dictate the narrative by side stepping and giving your husband the side eye before he moves to the suburbs and starts some shit like \u2018oh you don\u2019t need to lock your doors here!\u2019\n\nHe has no excuse but deal with mom and set some boundaries with him while you are at it. NTA and way nicer than I would be. World of difference between legal deeds and Jennifer Green sharing to \u2018Moms of Daughters Moving to the Burbs FB group\u2019 and its 95k members.
