It is a very exciting life transition that is mixed with some stress.\nFor context I have never lived in the suburbs or a house, I am from a big city and lived in apartments my whole life, so I am feeling a bit on edge from the big change. \n\nI have been keeping my mother up to date and she has been very excited. My mother and I have a complicated but very loving relationship. She is always very supportive, but one issue is, she often shares information about me with family, friends, and online without my consent. Sometimes she just shares things without asking (stuff that most would ask if they can tell others) and sometimes she shares things even when I ask her not to. Because of this I\u2019m careful about what I tell her. \n\nWhile looking at the house and making an offer she asked to see pictures so I sent the Zillow link (which was not the wisest of decisions on my part). I later found out she showed my whole family the link, including the price. I later asked her to just show screenshots of the house without the link, so people don\u2019t know how much we are spending. She agreed. Then once we closed on the house I received a message from my cousin that she had posted screenshots of the Zillow link on her public Facebook profile, which showed the address both in the screenshot and where she wrote the full address again in the comments. \n\nI got really stressed (I have experienced identity theft before) and called her and asked her to take it down. I saw that it had been up for 8 hours and panicked and started yelling at her about how dangerous it was and a breach of my privacy. She agreed to take it down. \n\nNow with some time and space, I feel really guilty about raising my voice and expressing so much anger towards her. \n\nMy husband wanted to focus on celebrating the purchase last night and did not think we had too much to worry about. He believes the risk is minimal regarding our physical well-being and burglary, and feels I was harsh on my mother. \n\nDid I overreact to my mother, and AITA?", "created_utc": 1671797012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztdn4e/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mom_for_posting_my_address/", "score": 180, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If a child understands this an adult definitely can", "NTA.\n\nI highly suggest you go to a couple of these realtor sites, redfin, Zillow, etc (basically any website that lists your house), create a log in, claim the house, and remove the listing photos.\n\nSuper easy to do, just Google \"how to remove WEBSITE NAME photos\" :)", "NTA it should be common sense not to put personal information online, *especially* information that's not yours and had no permission to post.

Bruh if you posted my address online im going nuclear full scorched earth and we are never speaking again i dont care who you are \n\nNot only are you very much NTA the fact that you even think you might be is deeply concerning", "NTA. She is completely in the wrong posting your personal information online and your reaction was appropriate", "NtA that is very dangerous. I find if hilarious that the generation that taught us stranger danger doesn't understand that the internet is almost all strangers. \n\nI would sit her down and explain some boundaries and then explain that other important parts of your life won't be shared until she can learn how to properly share good news for just safety: vacations, children, expensive presents you got.

First of all, you need to let go of being mad that your mom shared the Zillow link to the family. Everyone was going to find out how much you paid for it anyway. When anyone I know buys a new house I immediately look it up on Zillow myself and I\u2019m pretty sure anyone who says they doesn\u2019t is lying. The price is public record and there was never going to be any way to keep it secret. \n\nYou do have good reason to be annoyed at your mom for sharing the address publicly on Facebook. But there was no reason to start yelling at her about it right out of the gate. You could have just calmly explained and asked her to take it down; if she didn\u2019t, then you could have escalated to yelling.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You know she can't be trusted.", "On Day One of Social Media 101 they tell you to never ever EVER post your address or phone number or any other personal identifying information. Mom is old enough to understand why that is and remember not to do it. NTA. Sometimes we can't hear clearly unless the volume is turned up.", "ESH \n\nFeels a bit like an over reaction on your part. You can look up like 95% of people on the internet and find their address. The Zillow link was basically public information. You can look up house purchase prices online throught tax records as well. No one is going to steal your identity just by knowing your address.  After you expressed concern the first time your mother should have checked with you before sharing information.", "ESH sharing the zillow link isn't that weird. I look up what my friends houses - it's pretty common\n\nBut you also know your mom doesn't keep things to herself and you keep sharing info with her.", "It's info diet time. OP, don't tell your mother anything you don't want posted online from now on. She's repeatedly boundary stomped, and posting everything online is dangerous, especially on a public account. If you and hubby want kids and tell her about a pregnancy, she'll immediately start posting it on FB before you have the chance to announce the pregnancy yourself. You're going through something and don't want the world to know? She'll post it. \n\nI think you also need to address hubby's passive attitude towards it. He can be calm about it because he isn't the one who had to deal with the brunt of it, and the idea of \"the risk is minimal so it's fine\" is just so nonsensical. I said it in another post to a teenager, but apparently both hubby and mom need to learn that risk is a numbers game. The internet exposes you to more people, and some of those people are going to have bad intentions. There was a story of an influencer who took a picture in front of a window in her house and someone doxxed her based on a tree she had in her yard and by using street view photos to  confirm it was hers by the decoration visible from the windows. Don't post something online that you aren't okay with a stalker or your worst enemy seeing", "NTA that\u2019s a breech of trust. However, you know your address is public information, right? It\u2019s easily searchable on your city\u2019s appraisal district by owner name.", "Hate to break it to you, but property records are public information. You do not have anonymity anymore now that you are a home owner. Be prepared to get all sorts of official looking scammy junk mail trying to sell you title insurance and other things like that. It's not because your mom posted your address, it's because anyone can look that up in the city or county records. \n\nAnything on Zillow is also public and I'm sure your friends and family will look when you eventually give out the address (when they want to send you mail or visit you). Everyone does. \n\nESH. You majorly over reacted.", "NTA and your mother should not have posted your address without your permission but just in general you should also be aware that in many states in the US (if you are in the US) real estate sales are public, and if someone owns property you can find their full address just from googling their name", "NTA, after a history of invading your privacy and airing your personal business online, your mother has now doxed you. You need to decide whether or not you want to keep a relationship with someone who doesn't care about your safety", "NTA You Have Underreacted.", "NTA but I mean, your mother regularly violates your privacy and shares information like this by your own admission, so I\u2019m not entirely sure what you thought would happen here. \n\nPeople don\u2019t usually just change, expecting her to finally listen was kind of naive.", "Well, I\u2019m just gonna come right out and say it: stop sharing information with her. My mothers was that way too. She shared with me that my sis was having money issues, so I suggested a financial advisor might help. Next thing I know sis tells me to mind my own business and I\u2019m the AH, not my mom for sharing. Last time my sis ever spoke to me", "NTA. I think many parents or older folks don\u2019t seem to understand the internet that well. They don\u2019t understand how sharing is not limited to the people they think they are sharing with. \n\nAs another comment said, do not share anything with your Mother that you do not want posted online. She can\u2019t seem to respect that boundary. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about your address being posted online, the address was posted on the real estate site and was likely accessed by many people prior to it becoming your home. If you think anyone you know would break into your home then that\u2019s a different issue you should address. \n\nI think you reacted appropriately in the scenario because you felt violated but it would worthwhile to sit down with your Mom and explain the internet, your feelings, and set a boundary moving forward. And tell her that you will limit contact and it will negatively affect your relationship if she cannot respect your boundaries.", "NTA \n\nWho in thier right mind thinks it's acceptable to blast someone's address across social media. Having experienced stalking TWICE, I would have been livid too. \n\nHopefully your Mother will learn something about respecting privacy but I wouldn't hold your breath. \n\nIt's a shame you can't just share exciting news like this freely with her without worrying she'll blurt the most intimate facts to the world. It's awful to feel like you constantly have to be on your guard, especially with someone you should be able to trust implicitly.", "NTA, this is your information to share or not as you choose.  That said, this is all public information.  Any number of websites will happily report your address pretty much as soon as the deed is registered.", "YTA, all of this is public information. Someone can easily look up your address, tax info, purchase price online.", "This is a great idea. You should also report her Facebook post because if you check back in, it's probably not down", "Bad news:  Deeds list purchase price and are public record.", "NTA and I don't want to blame you but for the love of god, stop telling her stuff.", "Property purchases are public records, so while I agree that shes NTA and the mom still overstepped boundaries and over shared against the request of OP, it\u2019s not really as dangerous as people are making it sound considering all you need to find someone\u2019s address is their name and a google search. If someone really wanted to stalk her they wouldn\u2019t need her mom\u2019s Facebook post to do it.\n\nMy friend was visiting me from out of state and when I went to text her my address she said \u201coh I already have it, I googled it.\u201d It\u2019s really that simple", "Finally,  a rational reaction!  All these people saying that posting the address online is dangerous. I was sending out holiday cards last week and was able to find addresses online for all but one of my friends with very little effort, and I'm not some kind of investigative genius. Do people not realize how much of this information is already online? I get that OP's mom should have respected her request not to share the information, but if OP is going to be upset about information being online, she needs to direct this anger at people other than just her mom.", "I agree. Even just pictures and even descriptions are easily traceable. I knew someone that bought a house last year, I found it on Zillow and Redfin just by the description and general area. My family did the same when we bought a house and I posted a picture of the front of the house. I can pull up tax records for any property by finding the local GIS. It\u2019s all public information, if you know where to look.", "I had to scroll a long way to get to this comment. In the state that I live in anyone can search property tax records by owners name. Even \"famous\" people if they are dumb enough to buy property with their real names. \n\nI won't even post vacation pics on fb while I am on the vacation because my actual name is on my profile and it is just basically announcing my house is empty.", "I say NTA bc she didn\u2019t give her mom permission but associating posting addresses online with being dangerous is a bit of a stretch. Addresses are public information and if someone owns property in most states in the US, if not all, you just need to Google the person\u2019s name and their address will come up. Or you could get it from the city hall.\n\nOne of my friends was visiting me from out of state and when I texted her my address she said \u201coh I don\u2019t need it, I already googled it and found it myself.\u201d It\u2019s really that easy", "I agree NTA, I don't think anyone should post things about you without asking.  But also, isn't it public information anyway? When you close on a house it's published in the newspaper who bought it and how much was paid for it. Tax/property records show your name and address online as well. I also Google a person's name if I don't have their address handy and it usually pops right up.", "Bot", "Comment stolen from u/Hermiona1\n\nReport - spam - harmful bots", "People if they wanted could find out from places but the same time if the mom is offering up all the info in one place.", " I posted a picture of the front of the house.", "It's a one stop shop - she'll also have posted her maiden name, their first pet and what street they used to live on."]}
