He isn't sorry, and he isn't taking responsibility for his actions. If he was sorry and did take responsibility, he would acknowledge that what he did to you was cruel and you had every right not to forgive him. His being abused didn't excuse his behavior then and it doesn't excuse his behavior now. You aren't required to forgive someone; and the fact he got so angry, and then abusive, shows he really hasn't changed.", "NTA.\n\nHe is not entitled to forgiveness. He must accept that is it 100% your choice to choose when, if ever, to forgive him.", "NTA.   \nHe didn\u2019t seem particularly contrite.", "NTA. This dude used his apology to bully you again! This is not a true apology. True apologies are given without requirement of forgiveness.", "NTA \u2014 Choosing not to forgive someone is your right, even if that person had reasons to be like that. Your bully might be abused as a child, but he did actively choose to treat you badly, and his reaction makes it seem to me that he isn't truly remorseful about his actions, because if he was, he wouldn't have tried to force you to forgive him. You are right, it is not your fault that he was abused and it does not justify him abusing you in turn and taking his anger out on you. And to be honest, he is the AH here, not you.", "NTA!!! I would say that 20 times over if Reddit would let me lol. You are not! I would strongly suggest finding peace and eventually forgiving him (without telling him.  It would be an \u201cinternal\u201d peace you find to give yourself that release). BUT you never have to tell him you forgive him. He is wanting you to give him peace for being abusive to you all that time. You don\u2019t owe him anything. He can live with his choices just fine for the rest of his life because he made those decisions.", "NTA doesn\u2019t seem like the bully has changed, trying to bully you into forgiveness", "NTA. Trauma does not give a free pass on shitty behavior. Based on his reaction, he wasn't saying sorry to make ammends, he was looking to make himself feel better and fishing for you to feel bad for him and tell him it's ok.", "NTA.   You don't owe him forgiveness, and he needs to find peace in knowing that he hurt another human being and they don't forgive him for that.     \n\n\nHe's right that it's not his fault he was abused, but statistically, he wasn't the only person in your class who was abused, but he was the one who chose to abuse someone else.   I hope he is able to find it within himself to forgive that angry bully he used to be, but you are under no obligation to do so.", "NTA\nHe's still trying to bully you to get you to do what he wants. \nNever look back", "NTA. You're not responsible for his expectations.", "NTA\n\nHe didn't want to make amends, he wanted you to ease his guilt & he got pissed when you wouldn't absolve him. \n\nIf he was truly sorry for his past actions, he would have accepted your answer & left you alone. Just because a person apologizes, it doesn't mean you're obligated to forgive them.", "NTA you handled the situation well. It sounds like he's changed somewhat but still has a lot of maturing to do. You don't owe him anything and he's got to solve his issues on his own.", "NTA\n\nYou're under no obligation to forgive someone so they can tick a box on their \"all better now\" checklist.", "NTA \n\nWhilst it\u2019s awful that he was abused, forgiveness isn\u2019t something he\u2019s entitled to just because he apologised. You have the power to forgive, but he cannot make you, and neither can anybody else.", "NTA. His reaction proves that he was apologizing to make himself feel better, not because he actually cared about attempting to right his wrong. He just wanted you to make him feel better about himself/absolve him and you rightfully deprived him of that. I am petty enough to hope eventually you are able to glean a small measure of satisfaction from that in the future. Fuck that guy.", "NTA. What\u2019s weird to me is why this guy went so out of his way to try and see you F2F and get you to forgive him when he clearly wasn\u2019t sorry and didn\u2019t care at all about your feelings.", "NTA. Forgiveness is on your timeline, no one else's.", "Definitely nta.", "NTA\n\nBut coming from someone who was severely abused and finally forgave their tormentor...it brings you a lot of peace. That being said you can't force yourself to forgive but definitely try to focus on that for yourself. \n\nHe likely stormed out and is angry how he acted. It's a big step to apologize but he wasn't prepared for you not to accept. Not at all saying what he did is okay BUT you should find some small peace knowing he at least knows what he did was wrong. You aren't just a blurry face in his life...but someone he knows he hurt and deserved better.", "NTA, but it really will not help you to hold onto that resentment. \n\nAnd while I think the guy acted like an AH, have you ever empathized with what it\u2019s like growing up with abusive parents? I only ask because you mentioned that you asked your parents about the situation, so I imagine you have a good relationship.", "Forgiveness is to help heal you.  I was bullied terribly in grade school/hs. Really messed me up. But I moved on. I've learned to stand up for myself.  You can say \" thank you for the apology.

A genuine apology is not given with the expectation of forgiveness! It\u2019s one thing for him to explain his behavior in order to provide context for his apology and another thing completely to use that context to excuse said behavior. Don\u2019t invalidate your own feelings and experiences because he wanted to be absolved of his actions - it\u2019s on him to move forward without hurting others and whether or not you forgive him does not stop him from doing so.", "NTA\n\nYou could have said(if you felt the need to show grace).  \n\n*I'm sorry you were abused, I'm glad you got help.  But the therapy I have received for the years of abuse I Suffered has not yet reached the point that I can forgive you.  Maybe one day I will be there--it is not today.*\n\nAt that point if he then attacked, I would have said, *I am MORE than sure that YOUR therapist if they were as good as mine*\\[only if true\\] *would have told you that seeking out those you abused to apologize(and seek forgiveness) is for you to grow and resolve your past, you can NOT require another person to accept or forgive you.  That is NOT their job to absolve you of your past actions.*  \n\nYou are NTA for not accepting an apology nor must you provide the guilty party with forgiveness.  Actions have consequences.  HE doesn't get a pass.  This wasn't a one time thing, this was a literal terrorist agenda on his part who made your life miserable for over 5 yrs(not sure when in primary school it started).\n\nI Hope you heal from his actions to the point where you can forget about it most days.\n\nI'm probably a \"bit\" older than you and sometimes I remember moments of bullying still. For the most part I don't remember names and I'm not good with faces(and to be honest, some of my bullies--I didn't even know them, I was just a convenient receptacle for their preteen angst).  I can't even imagine what I would do if one of them came up to me and apologized.", "NTA this is right. The bully is still a bully, although seems that therapy helped him find a less obvious method of bullying.", "She doesn't need to forgive him to have peace", "> it brings you a lot of peace.\n\nNot everyone works the same way you do. Forgiveness is not necessary to have peace.", "Yes, me and my parents have a good relationship, but I know that growing up with abusive parents is a terrible experience that marks you for life. I think I can understand that. What I never understood was why take it out on people who have nothing to do with your situation. I had a friend that had the same experience with abusive parents, and he never once acted like that, but I\u2019m aware it\u2019s not the same thing as experiencing that yourself.\n\nI\u2019m sorry he had to deal with that growing up, I really am. He was a child and didn\u2019t deserve to be treated the way he did. It\u2019s still no excuse for how he treated me. \n\nI know that if I hold on to resentment, I will never find peace. I\u2019m trying, but\u2026well, the scars run deep.", "That is true.", "Every therapist I've seen and that my son has seen has said straight up,  no one owes you forgiveness.  No one.\n\nYou're NTA.
