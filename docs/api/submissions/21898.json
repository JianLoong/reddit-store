It\u2019s one thing for him to explain his behavior in order to provide context for his apology and another thing completely to use that context to excuse said behavior.

Her life was hell at the time. Told her just cause her life is hell doesn't mean she got to betray me like that.

He\u2019s seeking validation that he\u2019s not at fault for his actions.

You don't owe him an apology and if he is accepting what he did was wrong in the past he needs to also accept that his behaviour had consequences and that forgiveness from you may never be a reality.\n\nI will say, for your own recovery, while of course you don't have to forgive him, the impact of trauma on a young person can have huge effects on their personality. You had your difficulties and it seems so did he. Maybe from what he went through with his abuse he developed a tendency to focus on himself and his needs, which may account for why he reacted with frustration to you not forgiving him. People who have had their emotional needs neglected early in life can develop in this way. While you don't have to forgive him, maybe exploring this in therapy might help you get some understanding of why he did all those awful things to you in the past. \n\nWell done you though in speaking honestly to him about your feelings. Wishing you the best.", "Did he need to accept responsibilty and apologise, or did he need you to let him off? \nIf the former, he failed, and if the latter, then you owed him nothing.\n\nNTA.

Sounds like he dint grow alot over the years", "Absolutely NTA. I was abused at home as well. I was also the weird kid nobody wanted to be friends with. Abuse at home is no excuse to bully somebody.

This is a good example here.\n\nForgiveness is NOT for the abuser, it's for the survivor. And it's optional. You can absolutely decide to never forgive them ever - and that's absolutely okay.\n\n\nSome people think that forgiveness is great because it involves letting go of their own trauma and moving on. And also that's totally okay.\n\n\nBut it's a personal choice, and there's no wrong answer.

Holding on to those feelings hurts the person themselves more than the person who caused those feelings, so being able to let them go (easier said than done obviously) is helpful for moving on and being healthier and happier.\nBut OP was under no obligation to do this in her meeting with the bully or tell him that she would forgive him, especially given his reaction.", "good thing the bully is not a child.\n\nHe is now an adult that still doesn't know how to apologize properly, refuses to take responsibility and begins to insult when people don't mindlessly accept his weak 'apology'.", "Frankly, you didn't have any evidence that he was changed at all, all you had was his word. Given his record with you, it's sensible not to trust his word. So how could you forgive him? \n\nAs for never finding peace, that's not true. It just feels like that now because you just scratched at an old wound, but it will heal again. You can let go of those memories regardless of forgiving him, because your peace depends only of you.", "Wise advice for OP. And as for you I hope you are doing well. You are not a bad person for choosing not to forgive. If you won't mind me asking what has become of your bully?", "indeed. As long as hatred don't consume their life, or it is on their mind 24/7, it is 100 % fine to not forgive someone.\n\nPlus this whole 'you have to forgive for your own sake'-mentality really goes down the drain when applied to other situations.  \nCan you imagine telling someone who was raped as a child that 'they need to forgive to not let it affect them anymore'.", "I didn't say anything about being friends with anyone, forgiving someone isn't being friends with them. It is allowing yourself not to be bound up by the past. Never forgiving means never forgetting and holding bitterness inside you, I am not allowing some kids to hold sway over me.

This is just like every other bully and/or abuser who just learns therapy words to cover their shitty behavior.", "Never got that mentality that 'if you don't forgive someone, that must mean they are on your mind 24/7 and you are filled with hatred and bitterness!'\n\nLike, I have people I haven't forgiven.

It just means if they showed up at my door, asking for money for food, I tell them to go beg on the street rather than my front-door.  \nBasically I don't have them on my mind all the time, and I am not filled with hatred.

No judgement,  they are nothing to you as they should be.", "Fair enough, but experiences differ. For some people, those thoughts and feelings are much more intrusive and have more of an impact on their lives and wellbeing.", "I didn't say I wouldn't either. Like I said at the moment they are nothing to me and I also understand we are all different people now. I have had a drink with a few people that bullied me but was never particularly friendly with them.", "What a stupid thing to say.\nOp needs to sacrifice their mental health by lying about forgiving someone who abused them for years  so that the person who abused them for years can feel better?", "and that is when it gets unhealthy.\n\nI agree it shouldn't take over their life and be on their mind 24/7 and that if it does, they may need to seek help to get their feelings sorted out.\n\nBut I just dislike the mentality of 'you HAVE to forgive for your own sake'. It leaves no room for exceptions or situational differences."]}
