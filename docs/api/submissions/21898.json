A genuine apology is not given with the expectation of forgiveness! It\u2019s one thing for him to explain his behavior in order to provide context for his apology and another thing completely to use that context to excuse said behavior.

You can acknowledge that it happened, and it hurt you, but you can finally move beyond it.\n\nYou can forgive, so that you are no longer carrying the pain.  You don't have to forget.  This has shaped your whole childhood.  You can't be the person you might have been had he never hurt you.  \n\nThe person who bullied you wants to you to say something so that he doesn't have to carry the memory of what he did to you.

Take there bit out though, and everything you said is fine.", "He wanted to absolve his guilt. If he's in therapy this may have been a suggestion of the therapist. I hope they respond properly when he tells the therapist how it went.", "Nah f that. Ivwas friends with someone i met through a relgious ed program and she  went to a different reg  school than i did when were like 13. She brought something dangerous (think pointy and used in a kitchen)  to school and told her principal I was gonna do the same at mine when she was caught. I was searched, questioned, it was truly stressful and scary because I did nothing wrong and was confused on who would lie that I would do something like that. And then I remembered the one friend that told me they carried something around like that. Next time I saw her, she said she had something important to tell me next week; flash forward that week and I didn't give her a  chance to admit it and I just asked why? Her response? Her life was hell at the time. Told her just cause her life is hell doesn't mean she got to betray me like that. Unfriended her and was even tried to made feel guilty by the head of the religious ed program for not being forgiving or willing to forgive.\n\nTL; DR: you don't need to emphasize people that treat you badly", "See for me, how he reacted tell me he expected her to feel sorry and just tell him its ok. He wanted someone to tell him how he acted wasn't his fault so he can make himself feel better.", "People don\u2019t change overnight and I\u2019d say that apologizing at all shows growth.", "I still resent that one girl I mentioned in my previous comment and that was 10 years ago. Maybe in time that resentment youre feeling will fade, but until then feeling that way is totally ok regardless of what his situation was. I know people that were abused as kids and some were bullies others were not. He chose to use the  anger he received and dished it out."]}
