Her life was hell at the time. Told her just cause her life is hell doesn't mean she got to betray me like that.

If I was forgiven ID thank the person, apologize again, and move on. if I wasnt forgiven id thank the person for the chance to apologize, and move on. me feeling bad doesnt mean im owed forgivenness, me trying my best doesnt mean im owed forgiveness, same goes for that guy", "NTA\n\nYou're never obligated to forgive anyone.", "NTA.  The axe forgets, the tree remembers.", "NTA\n\nYou don't have to forgive him. The fact that he suffered abuse is horrible, however, it's not an excuse to then abuse others. I know people who were abused, some horrifically so, but none of them took it out on others.\n\nHow he behaved when you told him you don't forgive him indicates that he's still a bully. Carry on with your life and forget about him, he isn't worth your time or energy.", "An apology isn\u2019t supposed to be so the apologizer gets to unload their guilt and conscience.

Kinda leaning towards a NAH because he was a kid. It doesn't excuse the behaviour, but we can't hold children to the same standards as adults, and it's the adults who are to blame here. \n\nThey should have protected him. He should have been loved. Had he had the safe space to grow up, with good role models, neither of you would have experienced what you did. \n\nHe was looking for absolution in his apology when it should have been given without any expectation whatsoever. For that he's a bit of an AH. \n\nYou don't owe anyone your forgiveness. It's my personal belief and experience that life is better when you choose to give it anyway, but that doesn't mean you ever forget or would choose to allow them into your life again.", "NTA... If he were truly sorry, a heartfelt apology and acceptance of your position would suffice. But he had to try to control you even now. What a dick.", "You are not a bitter a hole.

Forgive him, get it off your plate and move on. Don\u2019t let him affect your life today or in the future. Let bitterness go. You got a apology and that is as much as you can get. Forgiveness is a gift to yourself. Take it", "NTA NTA NTA NTA NTA. He is not entitled to anything from you. Least of all forgiveness. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d over coffee doesn\u2019t erase YEARS of abuse. He has to live with the consequences of his actions. You owe him nothing.", "NTA, this guy has a lot more work to do in therapy.", "NTA.\nGet a glass and drop it on concrete.\nThen, say sorry to the glass pieces.\nDid saying sorry fix the glass?\nNo?\nWell, that's what I think about his apology.", "NTA. Being abused is no reason to abuse someone else. How can you be on the receiving side of abuse and go \"I want to make someone else feel this way\"\n\nSounds like his therapy and life lessons are only strong enough if everybody kisses his ass and eats his excuses.", "NTA\nAn apology is something you do because you know you did something wrong and want to hold yourself accountable for it. It should never come with an expectation of forgiveness. \n\nIt sounds like he was hoping to be absolved but that's not how it works. Good on you for holding your boundary. You showed a lot of grace just meeting with him, you do not owe him or anyone your forgiveness.", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t owe anybody forgiveness. Nor has he changed as he likes to think. He got angry about not being able to get your forgiveness. Shows he doesn\u2019t care about you, it\u2019s about him. \n\nMy ex broke my front tooth over ten years ago. I will never forgive him for it. But I\u2019m at a place where I\u2019m at peace with it. I have an amazing life and don\u2019t think about it. I\u2019ve moved forward from it.

Forgiveness is given for your own personal peace of mind and should only be done when you're ready, not forced. It isn't given out to let someone off the hook for what they've done. Sounds like this bully still has a lot of work to do on himself in therapy.", "NTA. It is your prerogative to forgive or not to forgive. Only you can make that decision.

That means he\u2019s still a bully.", "NTA - forgiving is a process. You may forgive him in time now that you know he was abused , but that is your decision. And it is a decision that takes time and a lot of generousity on your side. \n\nHe also needed to learn that he has to come to terms with his behavior and it\u2019s consequences. He has a long way to go in his therapy if he thought years of bullying could be erased with a coffee and a halfhearted sorry (a look i had a shitty reason, so make me feel better about myself).", "NTA. Abuse will never justify harming others. He's looking for an out instead of owning his actions. He's human. He messed up. You don't go in demanding forgiveness.\n\nOP, do not doubt yourself for a second. Abuse is a horrible thing, but we all decide to let it end with us or to spread it to others.", "NTA - when someone has wronged you, an apology is lovely yes, but that doesn\u2019t force forgiveness. They need to accept that what they did was wrong and sadly they may not get closure. He has no right to get mad at you for your feelings. He hasn\u2019t made much progress by the sound of it", "NTA. He tried to apologize to you probably because he is trying to shake off his guilt so he could feel better. \n\nI can relate with you so much, i was really bullied by same group of people for years and it persisted for like 8 years for sure, there was one boy who was really persistent and kept at it the longest. If he one day would come for my apology i would flip him off the same second he would try to do that.\n\n I still hate my bullies to this day i'm already in my late 20's, they ruined my self-esteem, i hate myself, don't have any friends (and honestly, i really don't crave for friendships thanks to all bullying and drama) and i'm pretty sure i have mild levels of social anxiety, i try to avoid human interactions (anyone outside of my family) as much as possible. BUT, i did miraculously  meet my husband and i have him so there's that.", "I was bullied at school. I was beaten, abused, had my personal belongings taken at least once a week, vandalised and robbed. I didn't have it too much better at home either\nIt still affects me. There are definitely aspects of my life that are different now because of the shit I went through 11-16. Was a very hard 5 years for me. However I have forgiven all the children that bullied me at school. Kids are animals and I couldn't let them have purchase over me. \n\nI never got an adult apologising to me for the unfair treatment I received. Not 1 of the 20 to 30 kids that bullied me on at least a weekly basis. I would accept their apologies if they did. It shows bollocks trying to get forgiveness and that this person at least has a conscience. \n\nYou don't have to give forgiveness to him or for him but you should forgive him and others who have wronged you, so that the past has less a hold on you allowing you to positively move into the future. Holding grudges against kids who have all grown up and changed hurts. \n\nHe doesn't have to know or even deserve to know he has been forgiven but you deserve to be able to let go. It honestly helped me so much", "NTA.  \nNever forgive a bully.", "NTA. He just wanted to apologize for himself, you dont owe him that peace", "Fuck that guy. You don't owe him shit", "NTA. You have no obligation to forgive someone. Forgiveness is something you decide for yourself - he can't force it out of you. You also don't even have a practical reason to do it either, because you'll never see him again. This guy was just looking to make himself feel better. If he really felt bad he would've told you that it's okay regardless of whether you forgive him or not and then asked if there was anything else he could do to make up for his actions.", "NTA - life is not a teen drama movie. He was expecting forgiveness so that leads me to the question:\n\n- Did he apologize for you or for feeling better with himself since he had taken for granted that you would have forgave him?\n\n(Idk if it's English ahaha)", "NTA. He only apologized to you for his own selfish reasons.  He felt guilty and thought if created a grand gesture, by asking you for coffee and apologizing years later adter his abuse, that you'd forgive him and he'd be the good guy. You shattered his fantasy by denying him the good guy ending and telling him you don't forgive him. If he was truly sorry and really meant it he accept your response with a bit of humility and left the cafe. Good for you to be true to yourself and not lie to make someone else feel better about themselves.  He ruined a huge part of your growing up and he was not truly sorry for what he did. I wish you the best and a continued recovery.", "NTA. He didn\u2019t call you to apologize, he called you to be forgiven. He sounds like a real ass.", "NTA.

Despite everything, you went to talk to him, faced him and told the truth about how horrible it was what he did to you. \nHis only answer should have been: I understand why you can't forgive me, I just wanted to let you know that I am sorry for everything. \nYou can't demand someone to forgive you. \nNTA!", "Ooooh I see.

Wouldn't be surprised if he was just checking the box.", "So he apologized for being a bully and when he didn\u2019t get what he wanted(you to say you forgive him), he tried to bully you into it. Yeah I think therapy isn\u2019t really working for him.\nYou were brave meet him after everything he did to you. And you didn\u2019t forgive him. Good for you. Everyone says to forgive and forget-but why? If it makes you feel better not to then don\u2019t do it. The bullies of the world don\u2019t deserve forgiveness. They deserve to be chucked into the abyss and treated like the slime they are. I\u2019m happy you stayed true to yourself and refused to forgive.

It's you standing your ground and telling someone that they still hurt you, and you don't forgive them for it, which is fine.\n\nIt's up to them to accept what they did and, instead of seeking forgiveness likely just to make themselves feel better, they can be a better person going forward without wanting some kind of reward for it.", "never trust anyone who has abused you to make themselves feel better in the past coming and insisting their behavior was justifiable years after the fact. you have no obligation to interact with someone like that at all. u dont have to forgive them or speak or make eye contact with anyone who makes/has made you uncomfortable. they are looking for another hit of power and control over u using new tactics.", "NTA. This apology is pretty weak sauce, but it is also coming from someone who is probably pretty new to the concept. That doesn't mean you have you have to accept it though.\n\nI personally think he is genuinely remorseful, especially with the fact that he struggles to accept how deep the wounds are that he's left. He's probably not prepared to fully comprehend it, but in order to properly learn from it, he has to accept it and use it as an example that shows that he is capable of hurting someone badly enough that there is nothing he can do to fix it.\n\n He has to know that there is someone in the world that he has blocked off with his actions. And you're helping him learn that. He's the asshole, not you. But he's an asshole on the mend. That doesn't mean you should forgive him though.", "Jumping on the top reply to add, OP- you can owe someone an apology, but you don't owe anyone forgiveness.\n\nIt sounds like his apology was a selfish one. A true apology is for the sake of the person you're apologizing to- you feel genuine remorse and want to make amends, but you accept it may not work. A selfish apology is for the person apologizing and is one that's aimed purely at forgiveness, whether or not it's deserved or earned. It doesn't take the person being apologized to into account at all because they're essentially a prop to make the person apologizing feel better.

We have a winner.\n\nI belong to a 12 step program where one of the steps is making amends for harm done.  I caution my sponsees that no one is required to speak to them to listen to an apology, nor are they required to accept an apology.  The person wanting to stay sober makes amends for past wrongs so they can move on, and how the recipient reacts is **none of their business.**\n\nAnd yeah, the bully is just finding a different way to bully.", "I imagine his therapist told him that parts of his story were not his fault.

I have moved on in my life, and I hope you do too.\"\n\n\nSo lie? \nCos Op is still dealing with the result of his bullying and therapy isn't magic. It takes time.
