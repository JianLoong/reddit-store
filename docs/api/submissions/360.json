Maybe I\u2019m giving it way too much thought.", "Back in the 1800s I believe they actually tried to start one. It\u2019s basically the same sign that the zodiac killer used to draw. I don\u2019t think the two r actually connected in anyway but I could be wrong", "Pretty sure you meant to comment to OP \ud83d\ude0a", "They went NC, so I don\u2019t see when they would be holding it over them", "They \"technically\" did pay, but the way it was worded, it sounds like they want her to be grateful for her food, clothing, shelter and education from before she was 18. This implies they want her to be grateful for something she didn't ask for or have a choice in, to be grateful for something that most of the world expects parents to be responsible for, the care of their children. I think it is morally wrong to expect someone to be grateful for something they didn't ask for or choose.", "Overthinking is what Reddit is about", "Well they did get in touch to ask for 2500, so there is some kind of avenue for contact.  \n\nMy point is that i, personally, would take this opportunity to pay for peace.  OP is in no way obligated to do it, but I would - again, personally - be plagued by guilt and self-doubt if I didn't.  Kinda the consequence of growing up in certain cultures. \n\nBuy freedom for a few thou?  Great ROI, IMO.", "I agree With you. Also, it\u2019s basic human rights. The childrens charter spells this out. Google human rights childrens rights ..it spells it out clearly. Some parents think they are martyrs for housing, feeding and educating a child. Total BS.", "Can't upvote that enough!", "Why do you assume it would buy OP freedom? If OP caves, they will probably contact them on a regular basis IMO. Now it\u2019s college, later it will be the cost of the entire upbringing since OP was a child. Then, it will probably be something like \u201cI gave birth to you, so you owe me\u201d.\n\nFurthermore, OP doesn\u2019t need to \u201cbuy\u201d their freedom. All they need to do is to block their shitty parent\u2019s number.", "It\u2019s an even better return on investment when you can get that same freedom for free. Which she can. How naive to believe a handout of $2500 would be the end of the interaction.", "They were probably culturally obligated to pay in the first place. You underestimate assholes like this, if she pays them back for her bachelor's, they absolutely will ask for more money again. This won't go away without enforcing the NC they started, might as well do so now.", "OP has already bought her freedom by going to grad school in Germany and getting a good job there.  She lives with the woman she loves.  More freedom!\n\nIf OP felt guilty about her treatment of her parents, then that is something to consider, but that is not the case. What has OP done to them?\n\nAlso consider that the parents paid for her Batchelor's degree AFTER being told by OP that she was gay."]}
