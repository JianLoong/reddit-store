Things maybe different in Canada cause yall are nicer in general.", "I would call the corporate offices of the hotel and talk to them about the lack of professionalism of their managers", "NTA the noisy people were clear arseholes but the hotel staff also failed here. I am a vengeful little fucker and would make it my business to flame them on every single platform with honest and terrible reviews. Are they part of a chain? Complain to higher ups. How did they get your room phone number?", "Exactly what I would have done.", "what makes you think this is even a legitimate post?  No hotel would simply ignore that as though they had no control.", "I think it somewhat depends. It could be a privately owned hotel that usually isn't busy, but is where some of the hockey teams always stay when they come into town for games or tournaments. In that case, I could see where they might not be willing to say anything so as not to risk losing all of those bookings in the future. \n\nI live in a place where there are lots of youth state sports tournaments, and there are a few hotels that are notoriously loud and rowdy during these tournaments. Since the hotel knows that the same team or teams stay there and book out lots of rooms every year or every few months even, they're willing to put up with a few other guests who likely won't ever come back anyway being angry.", "NTA\n\nBut lemme throw an AH on someone not mentioned in the story: the tournament organizers. \n\nIf they are all so full of energy at that hour they should be playing at that hour too. In league play last night puck drop wasn't until about 10:30 PM. We've had 1 AM puck drops in tournaments. If I recall correctly, 20 years ago one league had a 2 AM time slot.", "Nta find out the organization they were playing with and call them.  Admin doesn't like getting that kind of call!", "NTA. Common courtesy dictates quiet hours of around 10:00 pm, which varies a little from place to place (a frat row might go later), and there may be legally enforceable noise laws.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, even if they were annoyed at your request, dumping trash in front of your door is trashy behavior. The adults involved are low quality humans.", "only 15 rowdy kids? only 1030PM? as far as hockey tournment hotel experiences go, this is pretty mild!\n\ni'm going to go against the grain and say mild YTA. when a bus load of kids show up somewhere, the rules of that place often change. the difference between a quiet relaxing pool and a screaming party zone is like 5 kids. the hotel management had already accepted the kid-zone rules. sadly, it seems the memo didn't make it's way to you and your expectations of a normal hotel were met with the reality of the hockey tournament hotel. \n\nit sounds like you were able to force the hotel to enforce normal rules by making a fuss and issuing some threats. this is really just a power move to prioritize your comfort over someone elses. this is a pretty dangerous game to start with rowdy hockey teams. you got off easy with a couple prank calls and garbage bags.", "In the hotel we were staying in (and others I've stayed at), you can the operator, house keeping, room service and call room to room using the corded phone. The hotel we were staying in all you had to do was pick up the phone and dial 7 + room number to get through.", "[deleted]", "I worked at a Super 8.  The response of the hotel in the original post is 100% consistent with what my manager would have told the people in the story.", "The hotel did end up dealing with it when I threatened to call the fire marshal (as stated in the original post).\n\nManagement didn't want anything to be bothered dealing with it at the onset, but I forced their hand.", "No adult rec A. \n\nMajority of us were under 21 though.", "But we did have 5 AM practice for youth and high school hockey. Travel hockey had \"nicer\" time slots like 7 PM.", "ok. but why?  if a hotel reports rowdy guests to the police and asks them to be trespassed, they pretty much have to do it. So I don't know why they wouldn't just resort to that rather than say they can't do anything.", "Because if they don\u2019t do anything, then _they don\u2019t have to do anything._ \n\nHotel jobs mostly do not pay well. This is particularly true for overnight positions at the sort of place that gets youth athletic teams as customers. I guarantee you the front desk saw OP as the disturbance, not the kids in the hallway. They just wanted to be left alone until their shift was over.", "NTA.  That hotel chain would be getting a call to their corporate office for their awful handling of the situation.  And would\u2019ve insisted on a full refund.", "NTA. And if I was you I'd leave an honest review, and make sure to let people know that management took the side of the disgustingly rude guests.", "NTA. They were way out of line... the kids, the details. the adult supervision. Write a review and don't spare the details.", "Lol NTA- Welcome to Canada tho", "Blame Canada", "NTA", "YTA This is the most Canadian thing I've ever heard. How dare you spoil their fun.", "NTAH, you called the front desk and did the right thing.  Just turn the ringer off your phone the next time so the crank calls can't be put through.", "The families don\u2019t own the hotel tho and they\u2019re not the only persons staying there.

It was **exactly** like this.", ">  No hotel would simply ignore that as though they had no control.\n\nYeah, no. Lot's of bad hotels or badly trained and underpaid staff out there.", "i don't bring bus loads of kids anywhere, but if a bunch show up at a place where i want peace and quiet (which happens a lot in the summer), i move instead of making it the kids' problem.\n\nfighting with children is a losing strategy. they will outlast me", "Where was op supposed to go in the middle of the night?", "1. Police coming to the hotel makes the hotel look bad/get a bad reputation.  That means when there was an actual scary situation, they'd be slower to respond.\n2. Kicking out an entire baseball/soccer team would lead to so many complaints, which is a ton of paperwork/phone calls that night and the next day.\n3. Those complaints would also go to corporate, who would rain down hell upon us and refund the team anyhow.\n4. The teams talk to each other/tournament organizers and we'd get the rep for kicking out \"kids being kids.\"\n5. One guest being mad at the noise = 1 bad review online.  Kicking out an entire team leads to a slew of bad reviews from every single parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, cousin, godparent, etc. who couldn't believe how we treated their precious little angels who would never dream of doing anything wrong.\n6. Further guests would be disturbed by the scene of kicking the group out and, not knowing the specifics, would complain, too.", "i would either leave the second i saw a youth hockey team or tough it out. i always bring earplugs when travelling for these sorts of situations. i like to go with the flow.\n\ni know conflict is very popular in this sub, but in this case initiating and escalating a conflict is a dangerous play. OP is kinda lucky it worked out.", "NTA. \n\nI was in a similar situation in Brantford a few years ago. Hockey tournament and kids running wild. They were teens. I called the front desk nothing was done. I ended up finding another hotel online at midnight and left. On the way out, what looked to be all the parents were in a cafe type room near the entrance drinking.", "NTA. I would have gotten their school(s) or some identifying information to tell others how disgraceful they were. Shame on the adults who likely just wanted to drink.", "Mississauga is a hockey town. But NTA.", "NTA.  Time for some terribly honest reviews and a few complaint letters.", "NTA. Call corporation and demand a refund. That\u2019s BS.", "The reality is that the league and the parents don't care because their 8 year old kid is a \"big deal' back home in Sarnia or whatever shit hole they come from. \n\nThey come to the big city parading little Easton (named after a hockey stick) around as if he's the next Gretzky \n\nGive it a break parents, your kid is more likely to make me my double double in five years than he is to make it to the NHL. Until then, the parents drink and spend their life savings on a lottery ticket they call a child.", "I have been the same situation. I did not know there was a hockey tournament, I was visiting from out of province. The front desk did nothing. I thinks its easier to tell me to let it go then approach the 30+ drinking parents to control their kids.\n\nI contacted their corporate office. No response. I left a review as well. We left another midnight after finding another hotel online.", "I read /r/Talesfromthefrontdesk and the hotel staff there absolutely hate youth athletic teams for these reasons.  The FD agents usually feel for the guests making the complaints, but are between a rock and a hard place as to how to actually deal with them.   Also add the fact that the hockey parents are usually drunk so not making their best decisions..."]}
