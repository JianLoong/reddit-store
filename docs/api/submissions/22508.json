No hotel would simply ignore that as though they had no control.", "I think it somewhat depends. It could be a privately owned hotel that usually isn't busy, but is where some of the hockey teams always stay when they come into town for games or tournaments. In that case, I could see where they might not be willing to say anything so as not to risk losing all of those bookings in the future. \n\nI live in a place where there are lots of youth state sports tournaments, and there are a few hotels that are notoriously loud and rowdy during these tournaments. Since the hotel knows that the same team or teams stay there and book out lots of rooms every year or every few months even, they're willing to put up with a few other guests who likely won't ever come back anyway being angry.", "NTA\n\nBut lemme throw an AH on someone not mentioned in the story: the tournament organizers. \n\nIf they are all so full of energy at that hour they should be playing at that hour too. In league play last night puck drop wasn't until about 10:30 PM. We've had 1 AM puck drops in tournaments.

The adults involved are low quality humans.", "only 15 rowdy kids? only 1030PM? as far as hockey tournment hotel experiences go, this is pretty mild!\n\ni'm going to go against the grain and say mild YTA. when a bus load of kids show up somewhere, the rules of that place often change. the difference between a quiet relaxing pool and a screaming party zone is like 5 kids. the hotel management had already accepted the kid-zone rules. sadly, it seems the memo didn't make it's way to you and your expectations of a normal hotel were met with the reality of the hockey tournament hotel. \n\nit sounds like you were able to force the hotel to enforce normal rules by making a fuss and issuing some threats. this is really just a power move to prioritize your comfort over someone elses. this is a pretty dangerous game to start with rowdy hockey teams. you got off easy with a couple prank calls and garbage bags.", "In the hotel we were staying in (and others I've stayed at), you can the operator, house keeping, room service and call room to room using the corded phone.

Police coming to the hotel makes the hotel look bad/get a bad reputation.  That means when there was an actual scary situation, they'd be slower to respond.\n2.

Those complaints would also go to corporate, who would rain down hell upon us and refund the team anyhow.\n4. The teams talk to each other/tournament organizers and we'd get the rep for kicking out \"kids being kids.\"\n5. One guest being mad at the noise = 1 bad review online.  Kicking out an entire team leads to a slew of bad reviews from every single parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, cousin, godparent, etc. who couldn't believe how we treated their precious little angels who would never dream of doing anything wrong.\n6.
