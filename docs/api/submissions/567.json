Use nicknames if you want\u2026 it\u2019s a cat\nBut- you might enjoy this. My husband is a pharmacist and they had an Rx come through for a cat named \u201cMama\u201d and he said something to the owner about it being funny and she said \u201cyea until the neighbors hear my kids yell \u2018Mama, stop pooping in the garden!\u2019\u201c", "NAH. My dog is named Potato, and when she got out of the yard, I did feel pretty stupid running down the sidewalk yelling \u201cPotato!\u201d Also, I was barefoot, wearing my pajamas and an apron, but that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nFor the record, though, SuperDog is pretty funny.", "I can't stop laughing at hearing someone yelling \"SUPERDOG!\" outside for their pet cat!  I LOVE IT!!!!", "NAH, but that's a hilarious name.", "NAH.  \n\nCats don't generally respond to names, but to familiar voices (and smells--if the cat wanders off, put their litterbox or blankie outside and they'll often come back to it).  So you can name the cat Superdog and call them anything you like as long as you call them in a gentle voice that they associate with good things.\n\nWe have a cat who came from her previous family with the name Willa (middle name Cather, Cat-Her, geddit?  *eyeroll*).  We call her Willa, Willanilla, Willabops, My Darling Chucklehead, Stinky Rat Child, You Little Fluffernutter, and Princess.  She answers just the same.", "NAH. But honestly, if I saw a poster for a missing cat called SuperDog, I would go way out of my way to help find that awesome cat! (Objectively, it's a funny, adorable name and it's a lot better than French Fry.)", "NAH\n\nI think SuperDog is hilarious!! \nWe had a dog once named Timber. Great name except we live in the middle of a Christmas tree farm and I would be outside yelling,  \"Timber\" as people are cutting down trees.", "NAH, find an \u201cofficial\u201d name you both agree on. \n\nPlus everyone who has a pet has a million weird nicknames for them, so your partner can call the cat SuperDog all he wants", "NAH.\n\nBut my tuxedo cat is named \"Black and White Cat\" because no one could decide on a name for him.\n\nHere he is: https://imgur.com/a/zDSMlW5", "NAH. Both Superdog and Frenchfry are equally ridiculous, so you don't really have grounds to stand on telling your partner you don't want the name she chose because it's ridiculous. If you want to convince her, you'll either have to come up with a better reasoning for it or choose another name yourself.\n\nI do have a dog with a weird name, (I'll have to admit it's a lot less weird than the ones you two picked,) but people often have a hard time understanding his name and why would anyone name their dog that, (and my parents were super against it as I was still living with them when we adopted.) I don't care what people think and it hasn't caused us any problems.", "Nah. I would die laughing every time I called him but you both should love the name or pick another.\n\nThrowing a name in the hat here: my friend called her cat Mrs. Jansen...: )", "Eh NAH,\n\nI just know that my recently deceased cat listened to his name somewhat, as he associated that with food ( when human makes that sound, perk ears to listen if food is near ), but he never just came over when shouting that name. Vets frankly don't care bout the name.\n\nOur other cat... Uhm... Only listens to sqeauks, whistles and clicks. He ignores any calling of his name.", "NTA - both names are silly but I had a cat named CocoPuff, so who am I to talk.  I will say that regardless of whether it is \"normal\" in your country for cats to be outside, it still breaks my heart.  So many risks to life and health, hard on the local wildlife.  One of my furbabies is sleeping on my lap as I type this and it would break my heart if he got out and something happened to him.", "NTA. I have to laugh\u2026.we used to have a fluffy tuxedo cat, who looked like Sylvester.  He was an adopted stray so liked to still be outside a lot.   My son wanted to name him Stallone as he thought Sylvester was too pedestrian.   But the thought, just like you, of yelling out my house \u2018Stallone!\u2019 For anyone to hear made me cringe so I vetoed it!", "Super Dog just sort of kind of low key says the person hates the cat. Not sure why? My two cents. NAH of course, just my gut response to the name. \n\nNot gonna lie, FrenchFry doesn\u2019t totally do it for me either - hard to call the cat by. It\u2019s a bit like you\u2019re trying too hard to find a funny cat reference for the name and are going to explain it forever.", "INFO: Why would you be calling your cat inside for food anyway?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
