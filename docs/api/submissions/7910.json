HOWEVER. If you maintain this idea that it's okay to shake with a guy but not a woman, you had better come to terms with women finding this offensive. \n\nA woman who is denied this common courtesy by someone who would *not deny it to a man* is also allowed to feel that *you have shamed her*. Modesty is at the core of this practice, yes? So by refusing to shake her hand (but not your male friends' hands) you are implying that women hand-shakers are immodest. And possibly shameful.", "NTA, I've been on the opposite side of this. Was meeting my new team at a job, 2 of the woman were Muslim, extended my hand, they explained and I smiled and moved on, no offense taken.", "NTA You\u2019re allowed to have boundaries re: physical touch, whatever the reason may be. Besides, you even explained why you didn\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not like you completely ignored her.", "Nta. Your roommate needs to respect your personal boundaries even if he doesn't agree with them.", "NTA-Not shaking hands isn\u2019t rude. Chastising you for being unwilling to violate a religious boundary is rude.", "NTA. It's not personal. They can both get over it", "NTA. Roommate's sister understood and accepted your explanation. I don't understand why roommate is so offended when he knows your rule. It's not against the law to not shake hands. In fact, for the past few years, a lot of people weren't shaking hands anyway.", "No, NTA, it's a religious practice of your religion. Your roommate is just rude AF.", "NTA. You are following the rules of your culture. But you should understand that in western culture declining to shake someone's had is taken as a sign of disrespect and some people will react negatively to it, explanation or no.  I don't see an easy answer to this situation.", "Your NTA for following the rules of your religion.", "NTA. After covid it's perfectly normal for people to not shake hands simply because they don't want to touch. You have an even better reason than that. Plus it didn't seem like the sister minded at all! Sorry your roommate reacted so badly to what was a perfectly normal rule for you and your religion. I hope it blows over quick!", "NTA.", "Well, it looks like you can'win. You have to follow your religion but doing so you'll be considered rude in every country where women and men are treated equally.\n\n  \nESH or NAH, the points of view are too different", "NTA - you were polite and she had no problem with your religious customs. The roommate needs to calm down.", "NTA\n\nThey don\u2019t have to like it. They also don\u2019t have to obey it.

I hate when people use their religion as an excuse to be sexist.", "This is wild, my dad\u2018s entire side of the family is Muslim and I have never heard of this before. It\u2019s just another way for religion to be sexist.", "NTA. \n\nYour roommate should have informed his sister of your beliefs before introducing you.", "NTA. Your beliefs to follow, doesn\u2019t sound like the sister cared either.\n\nPurely out of curiosity, what\u2019s the line of thought behind that rule? Like is it a respect thing for one party in particular? I\u2019m pretty oblivious to religious stuff sorry", "NTA. You have a valid religious and cultural reason for not shaking hands with a woman and your roommate should respect that.\n\nBesides, shaking hands is so 2019!  Extended eye contact and a smile are better ways to connect.", "NTA you were polite and explained why. your roommate needs to have more respect for your religion", "NTA, I mean, as long as you weren't rude when explaining your religious rules, you're fine.", "YTA for being sexist. Nobody is saying you should be forced to shake a hand you don\u2019t want to, but you are still an AH for choosing not to shake women\u2019s hands and using religion as an excuse for sexism. \n\nGood litmus test- If this is a practice Iran would condone, you\u2019re probably being an AH.", "NTA. It sounds like you were otherwise polite and explained your reasons respectfully. If your roommate can\u2019t show you the same courtesy of respecting your religion and culture/not trying to control how you interact with other people, that\u2019s on him.", "NTA. I grew up with Muslim family and I've had several Muslim students. When I meet the parents, I wait for the men to offer their hands. If they don't want to be touched,  I will respect that. I have also had Christian men who didn't want to shake hands with women. \n\nOut of all the things I despise about organized religion,  this is the one I don't bother to get my nose out of joint about. If someone doesn't want to be touched, I will respect that,  even if it's for religious reasons I find personally offensive.", "YTA - if you choose to not shake her hand because she's a woman you're being sexist, even if you coat it with religion.\n\nIt happened to me once. I didn't make a scene either, but I still felt deeply disrespected.", "Nta we are still in a pandemic", "[deleted]", "YTA. You're being sexist.", "Nta, I don't shake everyone's hand I just met either because it's flu/RSV season and we have multiple variants of covid going around here still. \n\nYour boundary is valid and your roommate is overreacting.", "NTA. I\u2019m saying this as an atheist, because religion is and has always been a massive global social and political determinant: nobody has to touch anyone they don\u2019t want to, whether it\u2019s due to religious adherence or discomfort or germaphobia or whatever.\n\nIt helps to perhaps take the lead and simply wave at someone when they offer a handshake, and explain the way you did, and she and your roommate should have taken that at face value. \n\nWe\u2019ve gone so long during this pandemic that I think handshakes need to die. I don\u2019t want to \u201cput \u2018er there\u201d with some person who may or may not have washed their hands after eating or the bathroom. I don\u2019t like people who oversqueeze or offer limp fish hand. Cultures that bow have the main idea right, if I\u2019m honest!", "NTA ,if you are orthodox and fully follow all your religions teachings then people should have no problem understanding that.Very religious people of many faiths follow similar rules,for example I know many orthodox jews who would act exactly the same way ,where if it's a woman who isn't family or a wife they would not touch her in any way or even try to engage beyond a professional or work setting.", "Regardless of religion. \n\nCan we just normalize NOT having to touch someone in greeting? That\u2019s a good way to spread germs, LIKE A GLOBAL PANDEMIC! \n\nNTA.", "NTA for establishing your boundaries BUT it can come off as sexist to shake men\u2019s hands but not women\u2019s so an option could be that you shake neither but Idk, you do you.", "Not at all. This is similar to Orthodox Jews refraining from shaking hands with non-relatives of the opposite sex. It's no more an offense than passing on a ham sandwich being offered to you.

So that's kind of an odd excuse. \n\nAlso, this reasoning implies that you consider all women to be potential sex partners.", "It\u2019s considered immodest for unrelated, unmarried opposite sex individuals to make physical contact.", "Yes, but he also knew the rule, regardless. Of course he and his sister are equal, but has he ever called OP rude for not shaking hands with other females who are also equal to him?", "I absolutely agree, but as long as there are these differences it is difficult to find common ground. To better understand, I would like to know why there are similar rules.", "Yet if I didn't want to shake hands because I don't want to shake hands, that'd be just fine? I honestly don't care about the religious part, if a person doesn't want to shake hands they don't want to shake hands, you don't have to get into a big moral debate about it.", "Points up at username :-)\n\nPre-Covid, everyone that I know used to 'faire la bise' when they met each other, at least once on each cheek, often twice, because I live in Brittany. \n\nExcept my youngest kid, who's autistic and, like you, just isn't comfortable with it. \n\nEveryone is very understanding and accepting of their non-participation in this social ritual because it is applied equally to all.\n\nThe difficulty with OP's non-participation comes because it is not applied equally to all. OP only refuses to participate when meeting women.\n\nThere is a line where respect for others' religious beliefs, others' cultural practices and intolerance of bigotry, misogyny and outdated ideas meet.\n\nOften that line can be fuzzy, it's hard to know what is the right thing to do. \n\nSometimes it can mean acknowledging that long-term change of outdated religious ideas and cultural beliefs doesn't come from forcing your 'better way' on people. It comes from giving them the freedom to choose change for themselves.\n\nI find it hard to call anyone in this situation TA. \n\nIf OP is still young then his fundamentalist Islamic beliefs are a product of his immediate family environment and his religious education from infancy.\n\nIslam, just like all of the major religions worldwide, has a wide range of beliefs and practices. Each of these religions has some its believers who are more orthodox, more fundamentalist than others.\n\nRespecting OP's religious belief in this instance is probably the least worst path to take. But not completely unopposed, I would find a way to quietly state my discomfort and opposition to the practice, rather than taking it as a personal affront. \n\nTry to plant the seeds of doubt in his mind.

What exactly would shaking a woman\u2019s hand do?", "I mean, maybe he\u2019s never seen OP refuse to shake other women\u2019s hands or hasn\u2019t paid close attention.", "Both Islam and Judaism (as well as Christianity) are Abrahamic religions so at the core, there are many similar beliefs and even rules. \n\nAs far as very conservative branches of any (including very conservative Christian sects) men and women do not touch, if they are not related. The underlying reason is the idea of avoiding inappropriate intimate relationships. A handshake may be just a handshake, but if it's held a bit too long...or one of the 2 people feel a spark...or...Sure, to some it seems silly. To those that practice this avoidance of touching the opposite gender, it is not. \n\nLet's also know that if a Orthodox Jewish woman or stricter Islam woman or Christian woman were at the office, they would refuse to shake hands with men - so it goes both ways. \n\nAs an aside, many cultures do not touch in greeting anyway. Many Asian country's bow or head nod or give a body/head gesture.", "Those rules grew out of alot of cultural differences at the time, though nowadays shaking hands with the opposite sex isn't a big deal back then it was, adultery is considered one of the biggest sins in all abrahamic religions it makes sense that rules like this evolved, as a way to prevent one of the biggest sins.", "But OP doesn\u2019t for religious reasons. We can have a moral debate about whether a religion that discriminates based on gender should be the basis of one\u2019s moral judgement.

I would just know that they believe in one of the religions that is out of touch and still think that any interaction between the genders means you have to get married, and not interact with them as much.", "\u2026 again there\u2019s many types of different adherents to Islam so every Muslim is different. You never know there have been gay imams so", "Just as every religion has, not every single follower follows the rules to a t.", "Right.\n\nPay attention.\n\nIf you are so strict of a muslim that as a man you won't touch unrelated women you're not going to out yourself as gay by using the same standard and refusing to touch men.\n\nIn any case it's creepy af to treat every single unrelated woman (or man) as a potential sex partner, which is exactly what this restriction is.", "Right.\nBut the ones who *do* follow the rules to a t aren't outing themselves. \n\nI've known gay fundamentalists.  They don't make their homosexuality known by refusing to do things alone with a man. They don't do things alone with a woman because that would be seen as inappropriate *in their peer group*."]}
