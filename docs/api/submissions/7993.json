I\u2019m sorry your sister is not being a very responsible parent, which is what put you in the position where you had to discipline the six-year-old when you shouldn\u2019t have been the one to do it *and* you were trying to prioritize getting your infant child to sleep. At some point, I hope you are able to apologize to your niece for yelling and explain why you did, but she needs *much* more guidance from her own mother that she is not getting.

My heart breaks for the 12 year-old.  I wouldn\u2019t let mom and the 6 year-old visit, but I\u2019d certainly open an invitation to the 12 year-old and spoil her rotten.  You need to tell the family that if they think that is normal six year-old behavior, they need their heads examined and the child needs to be evaluated to see if there is a clinical issue or if it\u2019s just bad parenting.

A soft YTA on shouting at her, but honestly, being a sleep deprived mum of a young baby makes you cranky.\n\nI'm more worried about the older girl.

It's very obvious here the 6 year old is spoiled.", "Please keep an eye on your eldest niece if possible. She is the scapegoat and may need a sofa to sleep on in a couple of years.

It's a shame that your sister is such an erratic parent,  she should have been the one to put a stop to that behavior. \nBut thats not what worries me. You witnessed your eldest niece get screamed at and blamed incessantly to the point where she cried, and said there was nothing you could do. Wrong, you could have addressed your sister's behavior! Not only in restraining her youngest, but in not emotionally abusing her eldest! And if that's how she treats her when there's a witness, who knows how much worse things are behind closed doors! You need to keep a close eye on your sister and that poor girl because something is very wrong. Oh, and grow a backbone too. Why is it that the only person you blew up on was the child?

I had cousins that unfortunately were VERY similar to your nieces. the youngest was an absolute terror and he could get away with anything, while their oldest (who was genuinely a nice kid) was constantly yelled at for doing absolutely nothing, or for things the youngest did. The youngest would do things like blow out birthday cake candles aggressively, even when it wasn't his cake, and ended up spitting all over the cake, making it inedible, ruining games the rest of us were playing (he was several years younger and couldn't keep up) and if we did include him, he would get angry and ruin the game if he lost.
