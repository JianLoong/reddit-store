I live in London and my sister recently came to stay, my sister brought her eldest daughter (12) and she was great with Jack but the 6 year old was really difficult, she would fight everyone for the baby, kick off if she didn\u2019t have the baby , kick the pram (with the baby in it) if she couldn\u2019t push the pram (near roads), take the baby out his rocker when told not to and just be difficult in general. My sister wouldn\u2019t do anything but say she was tired and shout at the eldest for nothing? My poor 12 year old niece started crying at one point because of the amount of aggression her mum was using towards her, and whilst crying her mum shouted at her more and I couldn\u2019t do anything. \n\nBack at the house, my 6 year old niece would kick and scream and cry and this behaviour would be dismissed but the eldest is being punished and really being put through the wars for nothing.

I told her not to and 2 minutes later I find her trying to do it again , I told her not to and she\u2019d wait until I wasn\u2019t looking and would try take him out again.

Maybe shouting wasn't the best approach but someone needs to parent that little turd as her mother is not.\n\nPlease lookout your oldest neice, she is going to need someone on her side.", "NTA I wouldn't have waited for sis to volunteer to leave, she would have been out the second her child kept trying to lift the baby while she sat around screaming at the other kid. \n\nI'm sure you'll be thankful for the peace. \n\nBut i do have some concerns that at no point you tried to stick up for your other neice. She deserved better", "NTA YOUR child isn\u2019t a doll!", "NTA.  They're right, she's only 6.  But she acts 3.  And she's clearly too immature to hold the baby.\n\nI feel sorry for your 12 year old niece.  If you're able to spend some time with her, or even just do video calls or something, it might really help her as a teenager if she has a reliable adult she can trust - since her mom is clearly not it.", "NTA.\n\nKids need to learn that there are boundaries. Just because a child is 6 years old doesn\u2019t mean you should just give her free reign to do whatever you want because \u201cshe\u2019s only 6 years old\u201d.", "NTA - your baby is not a toy, and a six year old should understand the meaning of 'no'. \n\nI'm a bit concerned about the twelve year old though - it sounds like she's having a tough time. Is there some way to check in on her without her mum or little sister being around? I appreciate that's difficult for you to do while caring for a small baby.\n\nPerhaps you could invite her to babysit - not on her own but ask if she wants to mind the baby while you do some housework or something...and then use the opportunity to chat...", "NTA you explicitly told her not to get the baby out the Oran yet she did it anyway and as the mother you have the right to decide what\u2019s best for your child. \nYour sister sound like she can\u2019t see that her child is being a brat and instead takes it out on her other daughter", "NTA. The fact that the tantrums include kicking the pram make me worry for how the 6yo would react to being instructed on simply holding the baby the correct way. You are absolutely right to protect your baby. Not all 6 year olds are created equal. She needs to learn boundaries.\n\nIt's understandable that you're already taking on a huge emotional load with all of this going on, but I hope you feel some sort of responsibility to be able to talk to your sister about her behavior towards the 12yo. I was that kid in my house and I can't even begin to tell you the depth of the emotional scarring that kind of constant treatment is going to leave on her. It's probably already caused an astounding amount of damage. \n\nIt sounds like your sister needs a reality check. I'm sorry she's created a life that led to this stressful and disturbing situation. I wish you the best of luck going forward, and congrats on the baby boy \u2665\ufe0e", "NTA. Sounds like your sister has a major brat and refuses to address it and instead blames the older daughter. That is abusive behavior. \n\nYour job as a mom is to protect your child. Someone needs to sit down with your sister and tell her she has major issues and needs addressing. Her daughter is not the mother.", "NTA. I wish there were something you could do to help 12 year old Cinderella.", "NTA. 6 year olds would find a way to off themselves of we aren't looking. So holding a baby is absolutely off limits. \n\nAlso, your sister has serious issues. I pity the 12 y.o.", "NTA.\n\nYour baby is a living and breathing human being! That this even has to be discussed on here makes me fear for humanity even more.", "NTA. There is curiosity, and there is ignoring every boundary set before her. My only advice would be to have some guided, supervised time with the baby in a safe space. Instead of always saying no, suggest a different, safe way instead.", "NTA after telling her repeatedly not to do it, clearly she was pushing her boundaries a 6 year old understands the word NO", "NTA.  You have a duty to protect your newborn.  The 6 yo's behaviour is alarming, as if she thinks your baby is a toy.  \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA, your sister needs to be a parent and stop putting the responsibility on the 12 year old.", "NTA but your sister is a mess.  Your 12 yr old niece needs help.", "No.  But I'd have been tempted to tell your sis that she needed to take the 6-year-old and leave, but the 12-year-old was welcome to stay a bit.\n\nThe simple fact is that even a well-behaved 6-year-old should not be carrying around an infant and shouldn't be holding them unsupervised.   It's a safety issue, plan and simple.", "INFO: Why didn't you intervene when the oldest was being punished for the younger's tantrum?", "NTA- that 6 year old needs boundaries", "NTA. The safety of your baby is your top priority and you were right to worry about that in this situation. The fact that the 6 year is her mother\u2019s golden child makes her more of a risk. That sounds like a set up for years of unpleasant family time. It\u2019s good to set the precedent that no one gets to overrule your boundaries as a parent.", "NTA why is a 6 year old her 12 year old sisters problem, your poor niece is going to have some issues as she gets older. Your sister is too lazy to look after her kids.", "May. \nOp, please report your sister to child services for abusing your 12 y.o. niece. \nObviously your sister has a golden child, btw.", "NTA a baby is not a toy or doll.

Your sister has 7(!) children with 28. The oldest is 12, this means the sis got pregnant with 15? and with 6 younger siblings i bet she will treated as the second mom. With 12! And like it seems does your sis doesn't care about giving her children bounderies or teach them. Hopefully she isn't one of those who just loves babies and so get on child after another because they aren't cute anymore when they are a toddler and older.", "NTA - Sadly I'd doubt your sister would listen, but she is alienating her 12 year old at the worst time -- that girl is about to hit her teens when things get even tougher.  She's accepting how she is being treated now - but watch out for the next few years!  I'd consider talking to whichever family members are calling you out - switch the focus from your actions with the 6 year old and explain how sis is treating the 12 year old.   Yes the 6 year old was being awful, yet the bigger issue here is her older sister; maybe tell sis you are sorry you didn't have the patience with her, and gently try to bring up the 12 year old.  Maybe ask if she can come have a sleep over or something that you can praise her and have a little help...", "I\u2019m really struggling with sleep and so I did try to make sure my niece wasn\u2019t shouted at but at the end of the day I can only do so much. I should have tried harder .", "Some parents very obviously pick favorites. My girlfriend's sister is like that (we don't talk to her anymore for a lot of reasons). One day, she was at my place, and her kids were playing with my kids. Her younger son is physically dense, like he's just a heavy kid. Not fat, just dense. They were in my kids' room, and her younger son hit my younger son. She blamed her older son for not stopping his brother from hitting my kid.\n\nI felt so sorry for the older one.", "I don't think all six year old can't hold a baby. I think most would do well under supervision. Like sitting and holding, maybe. \n\nBut this 6 year old sees that baby as a plaything and a such should be kept far away", "The important thing with abused children is maintaining access to the abused child for their safety. Being cut off from seeing the child is dangerous. You cant really confront an abusive parent with an argument, abusers are emotionally fragile and will cut contact. You need to keep an eye on the kid and be a safe adult for them unless it is a situation where their life is in danger.", "I\u2019m really struggling with depression and sleep right now. The night before I only had 3 hours of sleep , I did try to make sure my niece was blamed for everything but I can only do so much. I should have tried harder.", "Child services isn't going to do a thing about that woman yelling at her daughter. Maybe they come take a look at things. But you bet your bottom dollar it will be another thing that the girl gets blamed for. And if it gets linked back to OP is hate to see her access to the child be cut off.", "Because she was chucking tantrums. I would not want her to hold my baby, would you?", "Would you wake a baby up for a six year to hold? Who is actively kicking things your baby are in.", "The baby was asleep...", "She's likely to get pregnant at 16 herself just so she can move out and get away from her mother.\n\nOr, she'll just get out as soon as she can afford to and cut contact and never have kids because of all the trauma of being responsible for the actions of her siblings.", "So when you witness abuse, do nothing? Don't talk to the daughter privately, don't address the issue at all, just let it happen?", "Thats not what I said. You are validating the childs feelings with the statements i suggested. I already posted about comments to say to the child. \n\nBut for the parent, addressing it in the moment is not smart, the abusive parent is dysregulated and isnt going to listen to anything you say. They are in fight mode. You approach the parent in private so they dont get triggered by criticism. The sister is yelling at the 12 yr old as projection of their own insecurity as a parent for their 6yr old. \n\nThe sister can be spoken to as\n\n\"Seems like youre struggling with the girls, are you feeling depressed?\" \n\nThe abusive mom has mental health issues, i feel with overwhelmed or ignorant parents we need to give them a little more understanding. Sister seems like a single mom. Shes outnumbered and unhappy.\n\nEta: the sister will feel more open to listening if we acknowledge they are a human with issues rather than a monster. They obvious have a difficult 6yr old and dont know how to handle them appropriately, they can change if we offer them help, not judgement."]}
