{"id": 3069, "submission_id": "z30lae", "title": "AITA for confronting someone I bullied about their passive aggressive post about me when I have tried to make amends?", "selftext": "I(29F) was a bully in high school. I\u2019m not proud of it, but I\u2019m not going to downplay or try to justify it or anything. I grew up, learned from my mistakes and didn\u2018t repeat them. \n\nOne of my targets was Ruby(28F). We ran in the same circle until high school, when I made friends with some people in a different group. You could say they were the popular kids. \n\nRuby being so obviously on the spectrum made her easy to bully. We also took advantage of how badly she wanted to be popular. Towards the end of high school, she started to stand up for herself more.\n\nIn college, I grew up and figured I would try to extend an olive branch. I started off by sending friend requests on social media, which were denied. I did, however, notice that she accepted my follow request on Instagram but didn\u2019t follow me back. \n\nI mention this because she regularly shares autism awareness and anti bullying content. I got the message and left her alone. I wasn\u2019t going to waste her or my time with an apology that wouldn\u2019t be accepted anyway. \n\nSeveral years ago, our old group had a reunion and I tried to talk to her there but was met with short and curt replies and death stares. Later, I saw she posted pictures specifically without me in them, and if I was in them, I was cropped out. I messaged the group chat we made to coordinate this meetup: \u201cWow, real mature Ruby\u201d which wasn\u2019t acknowledged.\n\nRecently, Ruby was in our hometown. She posted pictures with people we went to school with, which had passive aggressive captions about how they overcame bullying together and stayed together. \n\nAt one point, she even posted a story with the caption \u201cfuck you [my name], you will never stop me from living my best life.\u201d Again, I haven\u2019t interacted with her in many years by this point. Or bullied anyone at all. \n\nThe kicker though: she posted pictures with a couple of the guys from my old group, with a caption about how nice it is when people grow and change. I about had it at this point. \n\nI DMed her about how she clearly forgives male bullies who said worse shit than I ever did, but always snubs me when I have genuine remorse and didn\u2019t want to sleep with her. I also let her know that some people in the group still made fun of her when reminiscing, but she won\u2019t forgive the person who doesn\u2019t partake. \n\nOnce again, no direct communication. Just another passive aggressive post with a screenshot of the message and a caption about how I clearly haven\u2019t changed, and airing out all the trauma I inflicted on her. \n\nOther people from high school began to comment on that post about their own experiences with me. Some even started to DM me and call me out on behavior from over a decade ago. Which I haven\u2019t repeated.\n\nAm I really an AH for calling out hypocrisy like I see it? Like yeah she can choose who she forgives, but I can honestly say that others in the group bullied Ruby much worse than I ever did. I actually am sorry. And this is the one time I expressed any annoyance at this whole situation.", "created_utc": 1669237664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z30lae/aita_for_confronting_someone_i_bullied_about/", "score": 693, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not proud of it, but I\u2019m not going to downplay or try to justify it or anything. I grew up, learned from my mistakes and didn\u2018t repeat them. \n\nOne of my targets was Ruby(28F). We ran in the same circle until high school, when I made friends with some people in a different group. You could say they were the popular kids. \n\nRuby being so obviously on the spectrum made her easy to bully. We also took advantage of how badly she wanted to be popular. Towards the end of high school, she started to stand up for herself more.\n\nIn college, I grew up and figured I would try to extend an olive branch. I started off by sending friend requests on social media, which were denied. I did, however, notice that she accepted my follow request on Instagram but didn\u2019t follow me back. \n\nI mention this because she regularly shares autism awareness and anti bullying content. I got the message and left her alone. I wasn\u2019t going to waste her or my time with an apology that wouldn\u2019t be accepted anyway. \n\nSeveral years ago, our old group had a reunion and I tried to talk to her there but was met with short and curt replies and death stares. Later, I saw she posted pictures specifically without me in them, and if I was in them, I was cropped out. I messaged the group chat we made to coordinate this meetup: \u201cWow, real mature Ruby\u201d which wasn\u2019t acknowledged.\n\nRecently, Ruby was in our hometown. She posted pictures with people we went to school with, which had passive aggressive captions about how they overcame bullying together and stayed together. \n\nAt one point, she even posted a story with the caption \u201cfuck you [my name], you will never stop me from living my best life.\u201d Again, I haven\u2019t interacted with her in many years by this point. Or bullied anyone at all. \n\nThe kicker though: she posted pictures with a couple of the guys from my old group, with a caption about how nice it is when people grow and change. I about had it at this point. \n\nI DMed her about how she clearly forgives male bullies who said worse shit than I ever did, but always snubs me when I have genuine remorse and didn\u2019t want to sleep with her. I also let her know that some people in the group still made fun of her when reminiscing, but she won\u2019t forgive the person who doesn\u2019t partake. \n\nOnce again, no direct communication. Just another passive aggressive post with a screenshot of the message and a caption about how I clearly haven\u2019t changed, and airing out all the trauma I inflicted on her. \n\nOther people from high school began to comment on that post about their own experiences with me. Some even started to DM me and call me out on behavior from over a decade ago. Which I haven\u2019t repeated.\n\nAm I really an AH for calling out hypocrisy like I see it? Like yeah she can choose who she forgives, but I can honestly say that others in the group bullied Ruby much worse than I ever did. I actually am sorry. And this is the one time I expressed any annoyance at this whole situation.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My HS bully reached out in a similar way you did, didn't even Apologize (like you didn't either) but pretty much made excuses for the bullying.

She was calling them for days trying to make me talk to her.\n\nYou're still a bully. Probably just as mean and nasty as before.

There's nothing \"former\" about your status as a bully.  Leave her alone, and start doing some *actual* soul-searching about what it looks like to truly not be a bully, because you aren't there yet.\n\nYou say you made amends, but I don't see how.  You sent friend requests?  You made no attempt to actually reach out to apologize, you assumed it wouldn't be accepted because she posts autism awareness and anti-bullying content.  It is extremely telling that you assume those things are direct slights against you rather than things she is passionate about because of who she is and her past experiences.\n\nYou're bitter about her being friendly with other people who used to bully her, but you haven't stopped for a moment to ask about what's different there.  It is possible--even likely--that they have reached out to her in a spirit of true regret for their past actions, demonstrated that they've changed, and shown themselves to be sincere in a desire for friendship with her.  You have done none of those things.  It seems to me that you still feel like you're better than Ruby and want her to feel honored by the fact that you've even acknowledged her existence.

From her perspective without you the others wouldn't have been as bad as what they were. There are multiple kinds of bullys (I have come up with my own labelling system) and different kinds are forgivlable while others arent. You probably aren't in her eyes. I have been bullied for my autism and have forgiven some bullies but not others. One bully reached out and apologized but I won't fully forgive her until she apologizes to my best friend because she and her friends were worse to him.

That's not where you make a sincere apology. \n\nIf you actually wanted to apologize to this person, you would have sought them out in a private fashion, told them you wanted to talk to them about your behaviour, and then delivered a sincere statement that met the requirements of an effective apology: specific, takes responsibility, makes a commitment to change, and asks for forgiveness. Something like, \"Hey, Ruby. I know that I was a pretty awful person to you when we were in school together, and I think it's had a long-term impact on you.

Good for you for changing, but you clearly said or did something to her back then that has stuck with her over the years.  Either just leave her alone or send her a heartfelt private apology and then leave her alone.", "YTA.  You traumatized her all over again.  You sent her a friend request with no explanation and NO APOLOGY.  For all she knew, you were trying to stalk and bully her all over again.  If you had reached out with a private message first apologizing to her for everything you did, it might have gone over better, or maybe she would have ignored it and then you could have gone on with your life knowing you attempted to make amends.  But that's not what happened here.  Even if it were, I don't think you understand the lifelong damage that being a target of bullying can do.  Like her, I was a target of several bullies growing up.  The end result was a feeling like I was completely worthless for at least a decade after.  This is not something that a friend request with no explanation can fix.  \n\nNow, for your comment about the hypocrisy of accepting apologies from those who did worse -- first of all, it doesn't really appear that you truly apologized, and maybe you understood that it was wrong to have bullied her, you don't really seem that contrite.  When I went to class reunions, I had three totally unrelated people that apologized for things they said and did to me at various points of time while I was growing up.  One of them felt so bad and was so mortified  at his past behavior that he apologized at two consecutive reunions, and was falling all over himself trying to make sure I really understood how terrible he considered himself to have been, and that I never deserved any of it.  I forgave him instantly.  It was obvious that he was still beating himself up about what he did.  Another person, who used to refer to me as an acronym for several very unkind things *appeared to apologize to me,* but then she asked me to recount to her what the acronym stood for.  I don't really think she forgot, and I know I hadn't, and the entire experience traumatized me all over again.  \n\nIt is quite possible, and more than likely, that the people she forgave showed real contrition, and real humanity, and she was not only moved by it, but also healed.

I'm sure that moved things in the right direction /s", "Exactly!", "But she apparently still thinks that\u2019s \u201cmaking amends\u201d.", "There's nothing passive about that. Aggressive? Sure. It's OPs fault, though. A former bully can't be upset that their old target has their own way of dealing with trauma.", "I\u2019ll never forgive a bully, fuck them", "Exactly.  That's not an olive branch.  That's just being nosy about what your target is now up to.", "Granted that we are reading only one side of the story, taking direct messages and posting them rather than talking it out or arguing it out comes off as a AH move to me. I really don't think that either person is handling the situation all that well, but I am also not the largest fan of the social media and human interaction mix anymore.", "Same", "Wait. This is a better idea. Scratch my thing, do this instead OP!", "[deleted]", "Which goes to show she's really not interested in it.   A apology is about your contrition, not about their acceptance.", "Exactly! OP is delusional. YTA, OP.", "Exactly! How are they passive aggressive when she is 100% calling out OP directly with screenshots. Move on, you were awful, are still awful & can\u2019t fix this.", "Absolutely -- someone needed to point out that the bully does NOT get to decide the terms of forgiveness, inclusion, or acceptance.", "Right? OP went right back to stalking Ruby online and bullying in group chat when Ruby didn\u2019t fall all over herself letting OP apologize.", "Ain\u2019t that a real coward\u2019s escape hatch, tho?\n\n\u201cThey wouldnt have accepted it anyway\u201d kind of precludes the entire situation. OP thinks they know this person so well that they can see her future moves like it\u2019s a chess game, when really they don\u2019t appear to know dick. \nSaying \u201coh, well, she never would have listened\u201d both excuses the bully from needing to apologize while also throwing blame for the situation onto the victim. \n\nWhat OP is saying here is that it is their VICTIM\u2019s fault that OP *can\u2019t possibly* apologize, woe be the bully.", "I agree. It shouldn't matter if Ruby accepted her apology or not. She should still have apologized and then let things go.", "People like this just outright disgust me.", "It\u2019s just her ability to convince herself she\u2019s a good person even though she\u2019s still bullying her is what gets me. I was bullied a lot for everything from my hair cut to the color of my shoes to where my father was from and so much more. Bullies are petty, cowardly AHs with zero remorse and a narcissistic need to feel like they did no wrong and that they\u2019re better than others. It\u2019s no surprise she posted something like this.", ">taking direct messages and posting them rather than talking it out or arguing it out comes off as a AH move to me.\n\nBut why should Ruby have to \"talk it out\" with a bully who never apologized to her?", "So how is she NTA? She\u2019s an enormous AH.", "Right? That's what I feel. Yet Ruby obviously forgave some others and if I had to take a guess, I'd say it's because they *apologized*. But of course OP knows best.", "Ruby doesn't owe OP the time of day, and I see where you're going and you are right. My side is Ruby chooses to acknowledge that OP attempts to contact her, and done poorly based off what we are given, and does something with it. Ruby could choose to ignore the messages, and that is a different statement than taking a screenshot and posting about it. With the way things are, it's only going to lead to escalation and Ruby might not be fully in the wrong yet but can be quickly and it will not matter how things started and who said or did what.", "[deleted]", "The victim doesn\u2019t suck. How is any of this her fault? What\u2019s your deal?", "[deleted]", "She\u2019s not engaging her at all. Bully is DMing her and Ruby is choosing to post about it. This chick is stalking her at this point and will not leave her alone, and the victim, who you acknowledge is one, is sharing her experience. That is not AH behavior on Ruby\u2019s part. Your judgement just bewilders me but it\u2019s your right to make it.", "\nI can see where you\u2019re coming from for sure with your reasoning. Ruby might very well be feeling harassed at this point. On the surface it looks like petty drama, but if she was bullied for years and this girl won\u2019t leave her alone trying to \u201creconcile\u201d, yeah at this point it\u2019s stalkerish behavior.", "Yeah! It really is desperate and creepy behavior."]}
