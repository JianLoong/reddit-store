He has said very racist and hateful remarks in the few times I've met him. Such as calling a Muslim family \"towel heads\", commenting on how dark I am and now this \"joke\" about \"indian voodoo\". He is not invited to the wedding nor will he be allowed in my home. These comments are not jokes, they are racist and disgusting. If that is something you think is funny or okay, then fine you can do what you want, but I will not have any of it. You are still invited to the wedding, but he is not. And if you bring him anyways, you'll both be asked to leave.", "NTA\n\nYou just have to tell her the truth. \"Your boyfriend says racist things and you find it funny. I find it repulsive so please don't bring him to my wedding or my home\".  The only other alternative would be to laugh along with racism which I would not recommend.", "Nta. The fact that your mom thinks it's funny is a red flag.", "NTA.\n\nThere is absolutely nothing funny about the things he's said. It's incredibly offensive, and if he shows up to your wedding, there's every reason to believe he'll say more of those things. It's your wedding; you get to decide who you want there, and who you don't.", "how do you tell her? you say those exact words.  \n\nNTA. Tell her \"i am not comfortable with your boyfriend and his public racism at my wedding or my house.  you (mom) are welcome, but he is not.  if you bring him you will be told to leave too.\"", "NTA \n\nEnjoy your racist free wedding.", "NTA.\n\nYou just have to tell her that his comments and \u201cjokes\u201d make you uncomfortable. You\u2019re not risking him making others feel uncomfortable or worse, causing a scene on such an important day for you and your partner.\n\nGood luck though OP, hard to imagine it\u2019s going to go well. He sounds like a dick and I wouldn\u2019t want him around my family acting like that either.", "NTA \n\nHave you told her about the racist comments? In my experience, people either understand criticism or you need to cut them off. If your mom is fine with allowing her boyfriend to be racist, not just in general, but to her daughter\u2019s face? She needs to do some soul searching.", "NTA.\n\nEven if he didn't insult you and your culture on many occasions, it would still be well within your right to invite whoever you want - it's your special day, after all. You don't have a close relationship, there is no need for him to be there on your wedding day.\n\n...but he did say all those nasty things. Honestly, your mother's reaction to those \"jokes\" is weird, but like I said, you are free to choose your guest list. If you want your mom to be there without him, that's your right.", "Why are you inviting your racist mom?", "Wow. Just straight up tell her that his actions are racist and unacceptable, and you don\u2019t need that in your life. If she doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem, NTA even if you uninvited your mom.", "NTA. It's never wrong to exclude racists. I think you really need to think about whether or not you should invite your mother. She's not only accepting his racist behaviour but encouraging it by \"finding it funny.\" It's your wedding of course but I can tell you that in your shoes, there would be two free seats available for nonracist guests.", "NTA\n\n>my mom thinks what he says is funny\n\nRead somewhere here on AITA that if there are 10 people in a room and one is racist and they're cool with it, then you have 10 racists.\n\nSorry to hear that your mom is completely invalidating one side of your heritage and race by having such a racist boyfriend and making excuses for him. Just because she can't be alone or something doesn't mean she has to stay with the first AH she finds.\n\nAnyway, might as well just tell her that as much as you love her, you don't want your wedding disrupted by her boyfriend so he's not invited. Better be upfront. If she blows up at you, tell her that this is your boundary and she should respect it. She either comes w/o that AH, or she doesn't come at all.\n\nI hope you have a GREAT wedding! Congrats", "NTA\n\nDefinitely don't invite a racist to your wedding. Be clear about it you are not comfortable around him and it's your day so there is no room for debate on this.\n\nWe had to tell my MIL she couldn't bring her creepy boyfriend either. She still showed up with him so he had to wait in a bar attached to our venue.", "NTA, your Mom is definitely a problem here as the saying goes \" You are define by the company you keep.\" Your Mom knowingly dating some one like this but excuse his remarks as Racial Humor is just disgusting and really is s problem.  I fear that if you do invite your Mom and tell her that her Boyfriend can't come, the she would just bring him along whether it be your Wedding or new Home.  Please don't give a copy of the keys to your Mom as she will let her Boyfriend in whether or not you're home. \nHave  sit down with just you and Mom to let her know how you feel about her Boyfriend remarks and the way she justifies it. If she dismisses your feelings and argues that you're wrong or just being sensitive then you have your answer that she believes and prioritizes her Boyfriend over respect, dignity and her child.", "NTA and I wouldn't invite my own mother if she laughed off racist comments like that. My cousin is white and she's marrying a dark-skinned Indian man. Her unofficial stepdad made a bunch of racist comments about her fiance and got himself uninvited from their lives entirely, not just the wedding. I'm sorry it's your mom, though. That can't be easy for you to unpack/process.", "I\u2019m shocked you are even inviting your mom to the wedding. She\u2019s a racist by association. NTA", "NTA. I wouldn\u2019t invite the mother either. It\u2019s your wedding and you can invite and exclude whoever you want. You don\u2019t have to ignore racist tendencies because they are coming from your mothers boyfriend.", "You are NTA but how you do this is going to depend on how close your relationship is with your mother, and how strong your resolve.\n\nYou are NEVER TA to exclude racists - that is always ok in my book. And people who go along with racists are racists, too. Your mom thinking his hate speech is \"funny\" puts her in the racist camp as well.\n\nReally, you just have to tell her that he isn't welcome. Not to your wedding, not to your home, not to your personal events. It's only tricky because she will want him to be included, and she will probably take your rejection of him as a rejection of her. There may not be much you can do about that because that's HER problem to deal with. Invite her to anything you want, include her as much as you can. But you and your partner are going to have to stand strong through any tears, guilt trips or rages she, him or they will produce. Be prepared to kick him out if he shows up anywhere with her, and be prepared for her to choose to leave with him.\n\nFor the wedding, it may be worth having a couple of big ushers for security in case uninvited guests try to make an appearance. This will probably cause a scene, because hateful people do not go quietly. You may want to practice some grounding and coping skills to help you enjoy your day despite them.\n\nBut in the end, the only way to tell your mom that he is not welcome is to spell it out to her directly. She can date him if she wants - you aren't forcing her to choose! She will always be welcome, but he will not.\n\nUnless his racism rubs off on her over time, but that's another can of worms for another day.", "YWNBTA Just flat out tell your mother she is invited but her BF is not, if she asks, tell her why. You are right to exclude the clueless git. But if she has to ask, add her to the category of clueless.", "You tell her straight up, using your words. Here am I, all over on the other side of the Internet, and I understand your words perfectly well, although English is not my first language, so I am sure you can make yourself understood to your mum as well! NTA for doing it, by the way.", "NTA...However, if your mother thinks it's funny AND knows that it bothers you, why does she get a free pass?", "NTA. What an awful piece of work.", "Your wedding, Your time, Your money, Your event, Your memories. \nif you don't want someone there, don't. It's your event. \n\nIf mom can't take a hint of how much you hate him, then fuck her.", "I see two assholes who don\u2019t deserve to be invited.  Those would be your mom and her boyfriend.  They\u2019re both racist and should not have the privilege of being there.\n\nNTA, but YWBTA if either gets an invite.", "Most definitely NTA.

It's your wedding and you have every right to decide who gets to be there. This guy sounds absolutely terrible. Don't be surprised if you have uninvite your own mother, though cause it sounds like she is going to take his side.

The end.", "NTA - \"Mom,  you're invited, the racist isn't.\"", "Personally I'd say \"hey mom I don't want you or your racist boyfriend at my wedding or in my life\".

She can deal with them somewhere OTHER than your wedding.", "NTA.  But quick question OP, why is your AH mom still invited?  If that dude's racism isn't a deal breaker for her, what does that say about her views of you, your siblings, your father's family, your culture?  Why do you want any of that negative energy in your life?", "Glad you sent the message and for her response. Not sure why she puts up with his disrespect toward her child.\nOf course you are NTA.\nCongratulations on your wedding and your new home. I hope all goes well.", "Just tell her has insulted you too many times. His racist mouth is not funny. It's rude & ugly. Your wedding is going to be a happy event. It can't be if mister negativity (racism is negative) brings it down. You don't want him at your house because, once again, he has insulted you & is a racist. You don't need that.", "NTA i\u2019m very glad you sent that and your mom agrees. Hopefully this is a step towards her dumping that racist windbag.", " to the people asking why my mom is still invited to the wedding even though she's racist. Sadly it's cause I love her, she was the one who took care of me when I was sick, I ran to her when I was scared, she was the one person who made me feel safe, she was and still is my mom. Yes, she does have racist traits, but I call her out and talk each time so she's slowly learning. I'm sure some of you will understand and some of you won't, I love her for the mom she was not the person she is. I'm not sure if I'm holding onto a memory but I still want her there. \n\nAlso I sent the text to her and she replied \"I totally respect your opinion. I will respect your wishes. I too don\u2019t agree with his words.\"\n\nIt looks like she doesn't like how he talks either.", "That will do perfectly well. Short and to the point. I am at a loss to see what your mother sees in someone like that, but then again, what do I know?", "Good! I hope your mum realises how he's behaving and who she surrounds herself with.", "I just don't get why you're still even inviting her. Another commenter said something to the effect of \"how come it's a problem for moms bf to speak like that, but your mother gets a pass to thinking it's funny?\" I wouldn't invite mom either if I were you. Just to not have any drama there cause she might start something. I dunno her personally of course, but I'd rather not take that risk of my and my partners wedding being ruined due to racism.", "Yup, it sucks,OP, that your mom is a racist, but you\u2019re going to have to be forthright. Personally, I would not want her at the wedding either. NTA", "Dear mother is probably afraid to be/stay alone so she's making excuses for this AH, racism be damned", "this this this", "No, she has just been a closet racist and now she can finally find that stuff funny publicly because she is with a blatant racist.", "I'm glad that she's willing to accept your boundary!\nI understand about loving a difficult mom...", "I'm really glad she was understanding and disagree with his words. Hopefully, she'll come to her sense and get rid of him down the line. \n\nYou're obviously not the asshole. That's a reasonable boundary to draw. NTA", "Well to be fair to you, SHE IS you\u2019re mom is. Your mom probably never considered those things towards her own daughter.\n\nBUT. She will never understand how you feel, even if YOU\u2019RE HER DAUGHTER\n\nThe reality is that racism comes in many forms. There are the extreme form that you can see in certain people who like to run around wearing hoods in all white. Then there\u2019s those people a lot like your mother. They don\u2019t say anything over. They probably also actively decry blatant racism. But they also laugh at racist jokes. They also don\u2019t really understand how words can really hurt people. And they don\u2019t really try to.\n\nI say this as someone who never pass as white, Reddit likes to talk in extremes and polar opposites. You can still love your mom. You can still have her at your wedding. It\u2019s like many children of abuse, they might still love their parents, and still not know why. There is nothing wrong with loving your mother for all her imperfections and everything else. Humans are imperfect. And the reality is that your mother is not her boyfriend. \n\nYour mother is a pacifist, and that is very wrong. But the words and the beliefs of her boyfriend are not her own. The reality is is that people who are privileged, like your mother, find it easier to not say anything and maintain their happy bubble, then pop it\u2014 even though they know what they\u2019re saying in front of them is wrong. Does that make her cowardly? Maybe. Does that make her a bad person? Depends. For me, it makes her a very bad parent. In my opinion, she should not be dating someone like she\u2019s dating. It makes her a coward. My guess is she\u2019s probably afraid she\u2019ll never find love if she lets this hot mess go. But it makes for a human, and sometimes humans put selfishness and shortsightedness in front of the real things that really matter.", "Sounds like your mom gets it, or is at least trying to. I genuinely wish you good luck!\ud83d\udc9c", "Because that's her mom, and it's not always as easy to cut people off as Reddit seems to think it is.  Sometimes the people we love can disappoint us, but that doesn't mean we stop loving them, or that we don't want them there for our special moments.  But OP doesn't know or love the boyfriend, and so it's much easier to ban him from the wedding.\n\nThere are people that I love that are homophobic and possibly racist.  I don't know for *certain* that they're racist, because I've always changed the subject when they start to express... uncomfortable sentiments.  I can't change their mind - they're too old, and I'm not that persuasive.  It just leads to arguments and bitterness.  I tried when I was younger and it got us nowhere.\n\nI still love them, though.  And I'd still want them to be present for any significant moments.  I suppose I could be a purist and ban them, but it sure gets lonely in an ivory tower.", "That is what I am thinking, my dad did a number on her confidence. He cheated a lot and only got her gifts when he cheated, so my mom started hating any type of gift. When they broke up, she kept going from relationship to relationship, even if they were dirtbags", "It doesn't take much to break someone's \"picker\". And then we develop a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nMaybe at some point (not right now) but you can suggest you mom might talk to a good therapist. Having a professional to work with makes it a lot easier to untangle the knots and twists other people tied us into. She probably needs some healing so she can sort out the crappy partners from the good. It took me time and therapy to understand that NOBODY is actually better for me than the WRONG somebody.\n\nEnjoy your wedding!"]}
