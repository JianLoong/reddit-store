We would just sort and bake pre-baked stuff and sell it to our customers and if needed, give them advice to what kind of bread they would prefer. It was my first job as a salesperson.\n\nWe had a whatsapp group, where we would receive important information about the business or incoming changes. But some of the older ladies would use the group to vent about other co-workers. Which was fine, because they are old and our boss was one of them.\n\nIn my first week I had the closing shift with one of my younger co-workers, Sarah (22, female). We tried to leave the place as clean as possible. Since I was new and Sarah was a trainee we weren't able to finish all of our tasks punctually, but at least the important ones, like doing the invoice and depreciation. We also cleaned all the vending shelfs and the bread cutter.\n\nNow imagine waking up to your furiously vibrating phone and seeing one of the older ladies, Iris (56, female) writing: \"The bakery looks terrible! This is not acceptable!\"\nI responded: \"Is it possible for you to say that in a  more constructive way?\"\nThat was when Iris got defensive and wrote stuff like \"That was constructive! I don't know what the issue is. I told you what was wrong, you need to learn!\"\nSince I was treated terrible at my traineeship years before that job, I honestly wouldn't let that kind of stuff slide anymore. So I answered: \"First of all, you didn't say what was \"terrible\" and second, you knew I had closing shift yesterday, so why would you write it in the group instead of explaining my mistakes to me in private?\"\nThe older ladies became defensive, too. One of them told me to instantly come to my workplace so she can show me.\n\nIt was flour. Not even a bunch of flour, but flour dust on the coffee machine.\n\nStill, I apologized to Iris, because I still was a Newbie and she clearly was too sensitive for such a fight. Her reaction to my apology made me think it was over.\n\nShe literally quit the job the next day. She was employed for over 10 years. She told everyone that my misbehaviour as a younger generation made her uncomfortable and I didn't have any respect towards her as an older person. The other ladies came over that day to have a talk. They all said the same and were mad at me.\n\nThat was when I snapped and told them: \"If a grown woman decides to quit a job because of that, it is not my fault. If a grown adult is not able to take the bavklash of their behaviour, it is not my problem. And if y'all want my respect, you better start respecting me, too. Because I don't care about your age, we earn the same amount of money and have the same rank. You earn what you sow.\"\n\nSo, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691751541, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o5q6d/aita_for_saying_its_not_my_problem_that_a/", "score": 2446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If 3 people blame you, they may make life difficult for you.", "NTA\n\nAlthough I feel divided on whether \"Is it possible for you to say that in a more constructive way?\" was the best way to start. On one hand you're right: her comment was not constructive.  And it probably was good to stand up for yourself. On the other hand, criticizing someone who is already angry is only going to escalate things. Again maybe that is what needed to happen. But also you said yourself that you were not able to finish all your tasks, so bad phrasing notwithstanding, was she wrong?\n\nEither way, you're not responsible for her choice to quit. That is not your problem. She seems to feel entitled to respect while being disrespectful herself. That's not how things work.", "I hate the \u201crule\u201d respect your elders\u2026.like yeah to a point, but if y\u2019all don\u2019t want to show respect, you sure aren\u2019t getting any in return.

In the comments, OP mentions he\u2019s in Germany.", "Some people are saying you must be TA if you keep causing problems, but if your new job is still connected to this bakery then it seems plausible that there would be similar problems related to these rude older women - doesn't mean your TA, just means that you should probably leave these people all together.", "old ppl in general were terrible most of the time in my jobs. I had so much old co-workers who were amazing to work with. but as soon as they had a manager position, it was over.", "it happened to most of my younger coworkers", "can you imagine how such things sound to someone who tries to always satisfy their boss?", "Btw NTA clearly!", "In a bakery, cleaning up is hard work, you can't just leave it to the next guy if it is your responsibility.", "every behaviour should have baklava", " I work with someone like that.  We're both the same age too, mid 60s, and she's so sour! Always complaining, always irritated. It's exhausting being around her sometimes.   \nWhen I was around 19 or so, I was hired as an assistant at an ad agency.  I was thrilled to be joining the workforce and full of enthusiasm.  The VERY FIRST DAY, I get to work early and I'm in the ladies room, looking in the mirror touching up my make-up.  I'm in a good mood and this older lady, looked like she was in her early 50s comes in, and I smile at her thru the mirror but she glares at me, rolls her eyes and goes into the stall. I shrug my shoulders and apply some lipstick.  She comes back out, stops and looks at my reflection and asks with an attitude \"You do that everyday?\" (putting on make-up) and when I said yes, mostly, she rolls her eyes again, snorts and leaves. Another time she called me an idiot.  That was 45 years ago and I made damn sure I wasn't gonna turn into one of those sea hags no matter what life threw my way. Unfortunately I couldn't prevent that happening to my  daughter.  She works with someone like that at her job now.  She's the youngest person there and they never seem to let her forget it.", "The old lady clique is a real and scary thing.", "I don't understand why this thread is trying to pretend like older women are the only ones bringing drama to the workplace lol. \n\nDo you know how many \"situationships\" got turned into \"can't work together anymore\" by people in their 20s? \n\nAny electronics store/record store back before amazon took over was basically summer camp for adults, everyone hooking up and partying on the weekends.", "maybe a little bit? it was my first time standing up for myself in a job, so I wanted to share that, too.

You deleted your account because you couldn't handle the heat just like how Iris quit her job.", "I think that\u2019s the difference; I\u2019ve worked with older ladies too, and they were nice to me (young girl back then), but they were mean to the young boys.", "There are groups that are lovely and there are groups who are just awful.", "I had the same experience at my first job at 16. I worked at a library, and while most of them were old ladies, they were so sweet to the few of us that were younger and I considered them my work friends. My mom works there now and has told me a lot of them have passed away, which makes me sad.

You seem like a smart guy.", "Not* like", "yepp", "why would I be so dumb and put in \"I got fired bc of some dist\" if I missed other stuff? I own up to my mistakes I do at work and try to become better at my job. Hence why I asked to tepl me what was missing in a constructive manner.

Why would they hide other mistakes and downplay what I missed?", "I am a people pleaser and someone who tries to fulfill his tasks as good as possible.

Though of course your coworker didn\u2019t need to be rude about it.\n\nTheir standards were higher than you could keep up with and you got your whole workplace into a fight about it.

It's largely true, for North America at least. I'm a geriatric millennial born in 1984 and there's a definite trend of Boomers being more old school/conservative and people becoming more liberal as they get younger.\n\nThough, there's still a terrifying amount of conservative millennials.", "I didn't know what was missing, since it was my first closing shift with the trainee, she explained to me what was needed to be cleaned. ofc it's too much to remember the first shift. I know something was missing, but I didn't know what it was.\n\nAlso the fight with the boss at the grocery store? he insulted me bc I took a 5 minute break too late. He literally insulted me and tried to play down my mental problems when I called in sick once.\n\nidk what your experience is at workplaces, but I live in germany, we barely have any bosses or managers that are competent enough to fulfill their roles, which causes ALOT of ppl to avoid work and almost every workplace is understaffed.", "I mean, everything you told him is correct, but he is not trying to listen.
