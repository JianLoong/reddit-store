She said she needs to keep her hands busy and it\u2019s like fidgeting for her, but I severely doubt that she can be fully present. You don\u2019t have to pay attention when you fidget and she literally always jokes that she doesn\u2019t know how to count. She claimed it\u2019s not all the time\u2026 but it\u2019s definitely more often than not. She argued that she can follow TV show plots just fine but when I quizzed her on some details she couldn\u2019t answer some of the questions sooo\u2026 I think my point stands. Then she said \u201cIf it\u2019s an important conversation I obviously put my work down\u201d but I think we have different definitions of what important means. \n\nI also told her I would like to be able to cuddle and physically interact with her during TV time. She said we can still cuddle but it\u2019s literally not the same? I want her to be interested in me, not some pile of yarn.\n\nThis might be petty but I think I might feel better about it if she knitted things for me, but it always seems to be bags or clothes for herself or like random squares. She did make a pretty cute toy for my dog though, that was actually nice. \n\nAnyway I sat her down the other day and told her my perspective, and instead of being willing to compromise, she told me that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s not listening to her and essentially called me an asshole. \n\nShe\u2019s a great girl and I don\u2019t want to lose her over this but also not sure what to do.

You'd be OK with her knitting if it was something she was doing for YOU, but because she's not, she has to have her full undivided attention on YOU, at all times. You actually quizzed her about a TV show and her, according to you, not paying enough attention to the TV show. Pitiful. \n\nI've read a lot jealousy stories on here, but this is the first time ever I've read about someone being jealous of a ball of yarn.", "YTA. You absolutely can knit while maintaining concentration on other things, with the possible exception of any awkward or fiddly bits. Normal knitting just requires a rhythm to be kept. Leave her alone.", "Yes YTA. \n\nShe's correct that you can knit as a background fidget. It becomes automatic if you're doing simple rows like squares and it's easy to watch TV or have a relaxing conversation while doing so.\n\nSounds like she wants to watch TV to relax and knitting helps with that. You want to watch TV to follow every detail and do a pop quiz afterwards. To each their own. \n\nYou asked for more cuddles, she's offered more cuddles. Where's your compromise? \n\nYou knew she knitted when you started dating her. It's clearly important to her. She's even made a cute toy for your dog. Expecting her to drop a long held habit or to make that habit about you (after a *three month* relationship no less!) is an asshole move.

She doesn\u2019t do it during dinner, or any other time that some might consider rude, but now you\u2019re demanding that she stop knitting basically altogether in your presence so you can feel better about what you think she is focused on during these ordinary every day moments in life. Because for some reason just saying \u201chey let\u2019s cuddle and just pay attention to each other for a little bit and then I\u2019ll let you get back to it\u201d is not acceptable to you. And for some reason you demand that she pay attention to the TV too, as if this is important in a relationship or in life.\n\nIt\u2019s selfish and a bit controlling.\n\nThe idea of breaking up with someone because they aren\u2019t stopping their hobbies in their downtime to capitulate to someone who demands all of their attention makes me wonder how she could possibly not be thinking about it ending it with you. That you\u2019re even thinking about breaking up with her over this makes me think she absolutely should.\n\nYou are very insecure, and have stuff you need to work on.\n\nI know available men who are awesome, accepting, great looking, non-judgmental, and who don\u2019t feel the need to demand someone\u2019s undivided attention when they\u2019re watching TV, so by all means, let one of my friends meet this great girl you\u2019re so unsure about.

She might be a great girl, but you obviously aren't accepting her for who she is.\n\nOtherwise, just accept that she's not going to cuddle the way you prefer it and please expect not to be the center of someone's attention all the time.

I have crocheted many things while watching TV, having conversations, phonecalls etc. It's the knitting she doesn't have to really pay attention to, it just kinda happens unconsciously.

It sounds like what you're wanting is for your GF to be more present with you, which is an understandable feeling. I think that asking to cuddle without her knitting sometimes would be reasonable, because I could see how that might feel a little awkward.

It is a hobby but also so much more. I can be extremely relaxing, meditative and something nice to focus on. \n\nFor her it helps her focus on fidgeting so much which is great. Sounds more like you are jealous of her having a hobby.

Needles vs hooks, and in one you do partial stitches at a time and are required to keep the part of the stitch still in progress on the needle until it is done and the other you keep only a single loop active throughout. Additionally crochet takes a lot more yarn than knit. I would actually know because I do both. \n\n2. Crocheting and knitting while watching/listening to someone/something can actually improve concentration and retention in neurodivergent individuals such as myself, particularly ADHD folks.

I wasn't 'allowed' to play with them or take them out in the sunshine because then my attention wasn't fully on him.\nIt turned nasty when the baby was crying to be fed (breastfeeding) and the ex snatched the little one from me and hit me.\nDid I mention he is an EX?\n\nTo me, Your post sounds just like him talking.", "Harsh but fair, I felt.", "The horror! /s\n\nBut in reality at $30+/skein the good stuff ain\u2019t cheap!\n\nEdit-spelling", "I like what you did there haha", "Haha, thank you xxx", "The moment he said knitting hook I knew exactly what she was doing. And I can 100% garantee she's told him umpteenth times it's crochet.", "I\u2019m a knitter not a hooker but my eyes went crooked for a second there when I read \u201cknitting hook\u201d.", "This is a genuine question, I\u2019m not trying to be a shit, how? Like what\u2019s the set up?", "Same, I was reading from the start. Nobody told me it was \u201cimpossible\u201d so I just did it \ud83d\ude04", "I had an Auntie that crocheted. Her eyes were everywhere except her hands. She could do the most intricate things with that yarn without ever looking at it. Always amazed me.", "That part got me. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind it so much if it was stuff for me waaaaaah\u201d like come on. Her life doesn\u2019t need to revolve around you. YTA.", "Oh FUCK NO. I barely commit to making my parents and sister things and I\u2019ve known them 27 years lmao", "Omg I wouldn't crochet for someone I've been with less than a year!! And this guy...definitely not.", "Hahahaha", "Or that Lydia sounds fucking pissed off with you half the time: \u201cI am sworn to carry your burdens\u2026\u201d. Good luck finding a woman who will voluntarily, in 2023 in the western world, \u201cswear to carry your burdens\u201d.", "Then go to therapy to fix your extensive issues instead of trying to control your partner. She deserves so much better.", "No, you would prefer to change her and force her to stop her hobby.", "If she\u2019s such a catch, she doesn\u2019t need to change anything and can go find HERSELF a catch, she obviously pulled in an empty hook with her current relationship. YTA", "how would you feel if she picked a thing about you that means a lot to yourself and is a part of you and she just demanded that you change/stop that thing? its dehumanizing, youre treating her in a dehumanizing way. learn to respect people for who they are please", "Let her go so she can find someone that's just as much a catch as she is. 3 months in and you're already trying to control her? I'd dump you.", "But are you a catch?  I vote no", "And the way to resolve it is for you to get over your issues, and to just let her have her hobby. That is the way that you resolve this. You grow up, and you be mature about the situation, and you get over it. That's the only way this is going to work out for you.", "OP's girlfriend argued that she was able to focus on the show they were watching while working on her hobby. The thing is she wasn't able to to answer OP's question about the show which shows that (for that instance anyway) she wasn't able to concentrate on multitasking. \n\nAs I said in my original reply, I don't think she's being intentionally disrespectful. She and OP just seem to have a different way of thinking and what they want from a chill session together seems different too. They need to talk it out or just agree they are incompatible and split.", "It was written by a Christian Evangelist, he made up all the rest just to use the \u201cphysical touch\u201d portion to try to guilt women into fucking their emotionally vacant, religiously abusive husbands. Fuck that book, fuck the love languages. OP, in saying he only values physical touch and gifts, is literally who it was made to benefit.", "I know! I've told my husband that when I die, my yarn stash will be the single most valuable asset. He has a list of crochet/knitting friends to invite over to go through it.\n\nHe also has two sweaters (one pure cashmere!), half a dozen scarves with matching hats, and a partially finished bigass wool blanket that I hope to finish before the next winter ends.", "Yeah, but probably she told him while he was paying attention to a TV show \ud83d\ude01", "Pmplsh at I'm a knitter not a hooker \ud83e\udd23", ">not a hooker", "I second this question. I too am a knitter and have been doing it long enough were I don\u2019t have to look at my work and can just go by feel but how do you position the book, turn pages, keep book open and have space for said book and the project? I can\u2019t picture it", "Ebooks ftw", "I do this too, been knitting for 35 years (also since 4). I go by feel, I need to look the first couple rows and if I\u2019m doing lace need to look down periodically but once I get going and it\u2019s something flat that doesn\u2019t require cabling for example I can go entirely by feel. I knit continental, it seems easier to do by feel.", "He can stop watvhing tv so he can be present snd focus on her.", "yup it's right up there with alpha male wolf myth - seems to have captured a lot of people's imaginations but has no basis in evidence", "I\u2019m knitting a sweater for my daughter and my husband made some off hand comment about saving money by hand making their clothes. The yarn I\u2019m using is from Wonderland Yarns- hand died multi colored wool. It\u2019s beautiful and she wouldn\u2019t let go of it in the yarn store! I had to inform him that $60 was actually quite a lot for a 12month old\u2019s (the age she will be when I finish it) sweater. He rolled his eyes and joked that I\u2019m not allowed to hang out with my yarn buddy anymore. Lol", "She should quiz him on their conversations to see how well he\u2019s paying attention.", "IF you like to hug/be hugged while your partner isn't a huge fan of hugging, please don't blame them nor feel less loved because they do express their love differently than you. That's what I said/say.", "sure...... \"i love you but i won't do the things that make you feel loved\" but yeah ideally you should be with someone whose love language aligns with yours"]}
