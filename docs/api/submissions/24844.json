You'd be OK with her knitting if it was something she was doing for YOU, but because she's not, she has to have her full undivided attention on YOU, at all times. You actually quizzed her about a TV show and her, according to you, not paying enough attention to the TV show. Pitiful. \n\nI've read a lot jealousy stories on here, but this is the first time ever I've read about someone being jealous of a ball of yarn.", "YTA. You absolutely can knit while maintaining concentration on other things, with the possible exception of any awkward or fiddly bits. Normal knitting just requires a rhythm to be kept. Leave her alone.", "Yes YTA. \n\nShe's correct that you can knit as a background fidget. It becomes automatic if you're doing simple rows like squares and it's easy to watch TV or have a relaxing conversation while doing so.\n\nSounds like she wants to watch TV to relax and knitting helps with that. You want to watch TV to follow every detail and do a pop quiz afterwards. To each their own. \n\nYou asked for more cuddles, she's offered more cuddles. Where's your compromise? \n\nYou knew she knitted when you started dating her. It's clearly important to her. She's even made a cute toy for your dog. Expecting her to drop a long held habit or to make that habit about you (after a *three month* relationship no less!) is an asshole move. Shocked at your age as well, this behaviour sounds like a needy 19 y/o still figuring things out.", "She's got another 50 years of knitting ahead of her. Get on board or break up.", "[removed]", "Y are definitely TA.\n\nYour complaints boil down to your opinion of her being \u201cnot fully present\u201d, as if she is required to give you her full attention while you are watching TV or whatever. \n\nYou\u2019ve been with her for 3 months, knew she knitted, and are now trying to change her lifestyle and hobby to dedicate all of her attention to you. She doesn\u2019t do it during dinner, or any other time that some might consider rude, but now you\u2019re demanding that she stop knitting basically altogether in your presence so you can feel better about what you think she is focused on during these ordinary every day moments in life. Because for some reason just saying \u201chey let\u2019s cuddle and just pay attention to each other for a little bit and then I\u2019ll let you get back to it\u201d is not acceptable to you. And for some reason you demand that she pay attention to the TV too, as if this is important in a relationship or in life.\n\nIt\u2019s selfish and a bit controlling.\n\nThe idea of breaking up with someone because they aren\u2019t stopping their hobbies in their downtime to capitulate to someone who demands all of their attention makes me wonder how she could possibly not be thinking about it ending it with you. That you\u2019re even thinking about breaking up with her over this makes me think she absolutely should.\n\nYou are very insecure, and have stuff you need to work on.\n\nI know available men who are awesome, accepting, great looking, non-judgmental, and who don\u2019t feel the need to demand someone\u2019s undivided attention when they\u2019re watching TV, so by all means, let one of my friends meet this great girl you\u2019re so unsure about.

She might be a great girl, but you obviously aren't accepting her for who she is.\n\nOtherwise, just accept that she's not going to cuddle the way you prefer it and please expect not to be the center of someone's attention all the time. It is very unhealthy to only be interested in your partner: Hobbies and friends outside of the relationship are important.", "Yta. She should dump you and knit herself a new boyfriend. \n\nSeriously you are jealous of wool? I crochet and find it incredibly soothing and useful for anxiety. I have crocheted many things while watching TV, having conversations, phonecalls etc. It's the knitting she doesn't have to really pay attention to, it just kinda happens unconsciously.

You sound like a controlling arse to be honest.", "Dude, for important calls at work, I knit, it helps me.to stay focused and avoid my brain scattering around.

It sounds like what you're wanting is for your GF to be more present with you, which is an understandable feeling. I think that asking to cuddle without her knitting sometimes would be reasonable, because I could see how that might feel a little awkward.

It is a hobby but also so much more. I can be extremely relaxing, meditative and something nice to focus on. \n\nFor her it helps her focus on fidgeting so much which is great. Sounds more like you are jealous of her having a hobby. Start looking into hobby\u2019s that you like and how you can spend time together with you activities instead of being angry at you girlfriend for having one. \n\nRegarding that you want to have more physical touch, etc while watching an movie or just spend more time together. Plan more dates and during those focus on spending time on each other. Use those moments to focus on you girlfriend and she on you. Even dates at home and make it clear that this is a moment for each other. \n\nIt is so pathetic that the only way you might accept her hobby is if she knits things for you. If you were to ask she would probably do it because it is fun to knit things for people. But don\u2019t use it in a way of buying your relationship, because that is what it sounds like. \u201cYou can only knit if it is for me\u201d type of deal.

It proved nothing except your bad intention in this.\n\nAs for her supposed lack of compromise, again you don't get to dictate her behavior. She has nothing to compromise for. Don't date people expecting them to change and bend to your whims. She's still behaving the same way, you're the one that developed the problem with it. \n\nThese are all you issues.

Needles vs hooks, and in one you do partial stitches at a time and are required to keep the part of the stitch still in progress on the needle until it is done and the other you keep only a single loop active throughout. Additionally crochet takes a lot more yarn than knit. I would actually know because I do both. \n\n2. Crocheting and knitting while watching/listening to someone/something can actually improve concentration and retention in neurodivergent individuals such as myself, particularly ADHD folks.

Sometimes I lean on his shoulder while I'm working, or I'll sit at the opposite end of the couch and put my legs on him and he rubs them while we watch TV. \n\nIt's somewhat concerning that you say you give her your undivided attention and yet you didn't even know she was not knitting, I guarantee she's said crocheting.
