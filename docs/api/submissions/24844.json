She said she needs to keep her hands busy and it\u2019s like fidgeting for her, but I severely doubt that she can be fully present. You don\u2019t have to pay attention when you fidget and she literally always jokes that she doesn\u2019t know how to count. She claimed it\u2019s not all the time\u2026 but it\u2019s definitely more often than not. She argued that she can follow TV show plots just fine but when I quizzed her on some details she couldn\u2019t answer some of the questions sooo\u2026 I think my point stands. Then she said \u201cIf it\u2019s an important conversation I obviously put my work down\u201d but I think we have different definitions of what important means. \n\nI also told her I would like to be able to cuddle and physically interact with her during TV time. She said we can still cuddle but it\u2019s literally not the same? I want her to be interested in me, not some pile of yarn.\n\nThis might be petty but I think I might feel better about it if she knitted things for me, but it always seems to be bags or clothes for herself or like random squares. She did make a pretty cute toy for my dog though, that was actually nice. \n\nAnyway I sat her down the other day and told her my perspective, and instead of being willing to compromise, she told me that I\u2019m the one that\u2019s not listening to her and essentially called me an asshole. \n\nShe\u2019s a great girl and I don\u2019t want to lose her over this but also not sure what to do.

You'd be OK with her knitting if it was something she was doing for YOU, but because she's not, she has to have her full undivided attention on YOU, at all times. You actually quizzed her about a TV show and her, according to you, not paying enough attention to the TV show. Pitiful. \n\nI've read a lot jealousy stories on here, but this is the first time ever I've read about someone being jealous of a ball of yarn.", "YTA. You absolutely can knit while maintaining concentration on other things, with the possible exception of any awkward or fiddly bits. Normal knitting just requires a rhythm to be kept. Leave her alone.", "Yes YTA. \n\nShe's correct that you can knit as a background fidget. It becomes automatic if you're doing simple rows like squares and it's easy to watch TV or have a relaxing conversation while doing so.\n\nSounds like she wants to watch TV to relax and knitting helps with that. You want to watch TV to follow every detail and do a pop quiz afterwards. To each their own. \n\nYou asked for more cuddles, she's offered more cuddles. Where's your compromise? \n\nYou knew she knitted when you started dating her. It's clearly important to her. She's even made a cute toy for your dog. Expecting her to drop a long held habit or to make that habit about you (after a *three month* relationship no less!) is an asshole move.

She doesn\u2019t do it during dinner, or any other time that some might consider rude, but now you\u2019re demanding that she stop knitting basically altogether in your presence so you can feel better about what you think she is focused on during these ordinary every day moments in life. Because for some reason just saying \u201chey let\u2019s cuddle and just pay attention to each other for a little bit and then I\u2019ll let you get back to it\u201d is not acceptable to you. And for some reason you demand that she pay attention to the TV too, as if this is important in a relationship or in life.\n\nIt\u2019s selfish and a bit controlling.\n\nThe idea of breaking up with someone because they aren\u2019t stopping their hobbies in their downtime to capitulate to someone who demands all of their attention makes me wonder how she could possibly not be thinking about it ending it with you. That you\u2019re even thinking about breaking up with her over this makes me think she absolutely should.\n\nYou are very insecure, and have stuff you need to work on.\n\nI know available men who are awesome, accepting, great looking, non-judgmental, and who don\u2019t feel the need to demand someone\u2019s undivided attention when they\u2019re watching TV, so by all means, let one of my friends meet this great girl you\u2019re so unsure about.

She might be a great girl, but you obviously aren't accepting her for who she is.\n\nOtherwise, just accept that she's not going to cuddle the way you prefer it and please expect not to be the center of someone's attention all the time.

She should dump you and knit herself a new boyfriend. \n\nSeriously you are jealous of wool? I crochet and find it incredibly soothing and useful for anxiety. I have crocheted many things while watching TV, having conversations, phonecalls etc. It's the knitting she doesn't have to really pay attention to, it just kinda happens unconsciously.

It sounds like what you're wanting is for your GF to be more present with you, which is an understandable feeling. I think that asking to cuddle without her knitting sometimes would be reasonable, because I could see how that might feel a little awkward.

It is a hobby but also so much more. I can be extremely relaxing, meditative and something nice to focus on. \n\nFor her it helps her focus on fidgeting so much which is great. Sounds more like you are jealous of her having a hobby.

If you were to ask she would probably do it because it is fun to knit things for people.

Needles vs hooks, and in one you do partial stitches at a time and are required to keep the part of the stitch still in progress on the needle until it is done and the other you keep only a single loop active throughout. Additionally crochet takes a lot more yarn than knit. I would actually know because I do both. \n\n2. Crocheting and knitting while watching/listening to someone/something can actually improve concentration and retention in neurodivergent individuals such as myself, particularly ADHD folks.

Sometimes I lean on his shoulder while I'm working, or I'll sit at the opposite end of the couch and put my legs on him and he rubs them while we watch TV. \n\nIt's somewhat concerning that you say you give her your undivided attention and yet you didn't even know she was not knitting, I guarantee she's said crocheting.

It\u2019s a knitting needle or crochet hook. Since he\u2019s referring squares, I presume she\u2019s crocheting granny squares with a crochet hook. Came here to bitch about her hobby and doesn\u2019t even know what it is.", "actually a love language is how you want love shown to you not how you show it.", "It lets her buy the expensive cashmere alpaca blend yarn, and the fancy Furls hooks, which she will use to make things for herself!!", "ayyyyyyy", "Please take my poor person\u2019s gold. \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd47", "I have a temperature blanket, an amigurumi (both crochet).

The way you show love would most times mentally make you feel more love when it is given to you?  \n\nSo if you go all out on someone's birthday, you're gonna feel more loved when they go all out on your birthday too. \n\nIf he feels love receiving gifts, he would also (probably subconsciously) be giving gifts too.\n\nI'm not defending OP. He's a total ass. \n\nWhether you agree love languages are real or not doesn't matter. There is something out there that makes you feel loved more than another act, and there's something you subconsciously jump to when you feel that need to express love for someome else. \nFor me, it was drawing. When I had a crush, I'd draw them and gift it to them. Though, I'd probably get some insecurities if someone drew me.", "it's been pretty much debunked in the peer reviewed literature. At best it's a useful tool for expressing your own needs, but it's been misappropriated in the same way 'boundaries' have.", "While watching television? You're giving her your full attention while watching TV? \n\nDidn't you just say she can't possibly be paying full attention to the TV if she's knitting? How do you manage two tasks at once?", "Jesus christ that's not a compromise lol", "Oh dear god YTA just break up with her if *you* need to limpet all the time.\n\nDon't expect someone to change who they were when they met you.

You sounds veeeery needy, a good dose of growing up is needed here.", "You mentioned not being able to \u2018physically interact\u2019 with her when she\u2019s knitting. I\u2019m beginning to think you mean you can\u2019t have sex with her while she knits. It\u2019s kinda hard to make a move on her when she\u2019s got those pointy sticks, eh?\n\nThree months in and you\u2019re this upset by such a small thing.  She\u2019s not going to give up knitting, and the more you push her about it, the sooner she\u2019s going to dump your ass.", "when? be specific.", "Google the definition of compromise.

Hope she opens her eyes.", "So shut up and let her knit, or leave.", "You\u2019re not trying to resolve. You\u2019re trying to get her to do things your way.

She's definitely crocheting then, and OP didn't even bother to find out the difference in 3 months.", "I don't understand what you mean. and i don't get the downvotes on my comment. if your love language is gifts for example, that means you know someone loves you by receiving gifts from them. if you buy gifts for someone whose love language is something else they won't appreciate it the same. this is a very simple concept", "Still sounds super toxic by expecting someone to do a specific thing else it doesn't fit -your- vision of \"love\" ...", "lol what? if i like being hugged but don't like getting gifts, but my partner's love language is gifts, then I'm toxic for wanting a hug instead of a gift??? makes more sense to love your partner the way they want to be loved, rather than the way you think they should be loved. selfish much?"]}
