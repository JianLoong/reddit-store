Thankfully, we are in a position where we can do this without worrying about the cost.\n\nOur son wanted to have a vintage sports theme, very 1950s. He\u2019s the sporty one of our kids and he was inspired by some things he saw online. Our daughter was looking at stuff in TikTok for room inspiration.\n\nFor our son\u2019s room, we\u2019ve been going to antique stores and thrift stores for vintage sports memorabilia and vintage furniture. \n\nWe were recently at the thrift store looking for some items, our daughter was with us and made multiple comments about if he really wanted his room to have \u201ctrashy\u201d stuff in it and was making some comments about what people were wearing, we told her to stop but she was clearly getting a reaction out of his response. \n\nA few days later, our son was asking his girlfriend (13f)  if she had any ideas for stuff that match his room to remind him of her. She\u2019s transgender and was helping him look for something to match his room aesthetic. Our daughter decided to make some snarky remarks about the stuff they were looking at, saying about how \u201cthe vintage days weren\u2019t good for people like her\u201d, my son knows this and it was making his gf upset. We had to break it up and had a long talk with her, she apologized to our son\u2019s gf and he\u2019s still a bit upset over it, which is understandable, they\u2019re a good couple and he loves her.\n\nYesterday, we got a call from the school that she was making some comments about her brother, including ones about the furniture she saw and his gf. These were pretty classist and transphobic. We took away her devices until we knew why she did it and grounded her. We realized that our talks with her weren\u2019t working and at this point, she was choosing to do wrong rather than ignorance. \n\nIn addition to losing her devices, we told her she needs to do community service with various organizations to see and have empathy for the struggles of others. Our kids have grown up with money and I guess it\u2019s made our daughter spoiled.\n\nMy parents have heard about this and said that we are being too hard on our daughter and said that we should just continue to talk to her about what she did wrong and we aren\u2019t giving her enough leeway to make mistakes. They also said her doing community service may hurt the people she bullied.

No issue with the punishment, but you or your wife should volunteer as well to keep an eye on her.  Given what you have written, there's a good chance she may verbally abuse other volunteers.", "Info: did you ask your daughter the reason for her behaviour?   \n\n\nFor a young age of 13, it\u2019s odd that a kid suddenly acquires bigoted behaviour. Usually those behaviours come from watching the parents  but you are not those types.   I think more is going on.", "NTA for wanting to correct her but using people's struggles as punishment usually doesn't have the effect you want on your kid, and exposes folks to her bigotry, often doing more harm than good. People aren't object lessons.", "NTA. Your daughter's behavior towards her brother and his girlfriend was unacceptable and needed to be addressed. It's important for her to understand the impact her words can have on others and to learn empathy. Taking away her devices and making her do community service are reasonable consequences for her actions.\n\nAs for your parents' opinion, it's important to remember that ultimately you are the parent and responsible for how you choose to discipline your child. Continuing to talk to her about her actions may not be enough if she continues to make hurtful comments. Community service can be a positive way for her to learn and grow, as long as it's done with the intention of bettering herself and not just to check a box. It's also important to consider the impact on the community service organization and to choose one that aligns with your daughter's interests and values.", "NTA - but I would caution that punishment. Possibly look into having her do more research on the groups that she doesn't understand. There is plenty of age appropriate reading or videos she could be watching that would help her gain a better understanding. Also, therapy. She may have some deep hatred for reasons that you won't understand at this time. A therapist could help her work through them.", "Tell your parents to mind their own business. \n\nWhat's with all these  family members getting involved in parent/child issues", "NTA you are right to nip this in the bud.  \n\nI do not get why doing community service may hurt the people she bullied?\n\nbut she is at the age where she is acting out for a reason, is she trying to fit in in school?  Feeling insecure about something?  I would try and find out is there a root cause to her behaviour, as otherwise, she will continue to hurt others around her.", "NTA. Good for you guys for not raising assholes. There is a difference between making mistakes and being blatantly racist and sexist. She is old enough to know better. I also sense a lack in conscience if she can deliberately insult someone continually who has become a part of their family. Teenage girls can be ruthless. Hopefully she takes this as a hard lesson and starts to make some changes.", "NTA. She needs to learn empathy and that words really, really hurt. Don't give in. Don't enable her bad behavior. You're good parents. \n\nGrandparents need to stay the hell out of this. It's not their child and it's not their call.", "NTA. I'm frankly in awe of this incredible parenting. You're wonderful.   \n\n\nTbh I'm of the opinion that every child should do at least one round of community service/volunteering a year whether it's framed as 'punishment' or not. I did, and I'm so grateful for the empathy and work ethic it gave me growing up. You are trying to nip her hateful rhetoric in the bud and she will be a much better person for it. Don't listen to the criticism from your parents. *This is excellent parenting.* Please *s*tay the course.", "NTA. You're desperately trying to fix a spoiled child's attitude. She needs to learn self reflection. Because she's being a classic bully for no reason.\n\nMaybe some therapy for her and the family could help understand her lack of empathy", "NTA \n\nCareful with the community service tho.  She may come to resent the people she\u2019s forced to help through the community service and further ingrain whatever transphobic feelings she\u2019s having.", "NTA, This is textbook GOOD parenting when it comes to stuff like this.", "Sounds like a good place to start. Check in with her community service, even volunteering with her a couple times. Keep an eye on your daughter and also on her friend group, moving forward. NTA.", "Info: You said that you were going to find out why she was doing all of this. Did you even find this out or did you just go straight for the punishment?", "Good for you!\n\nShe\u2019s exploring boundaries and limits, and is hitting that sweet spot of teenagers thinking they know everything before they know anything. Some are more receptive to learning rather than assuming. she doesn\u2019t sound like one, unfortunately, and her assumptions are of the sooner corrected, the better, variety.\n\nNTA", "NTA, she needs to be knocked off whatever BS pedestal she thinks she's standing on!", "NTA. She's old enough to understand consequences.", "ESH\n\nYou have six children and you are shocked that one of them is acting out when youre focusing your attention on tailoring another one's room? You didn't mention a word about how she wanted to decorate her room, assuming she's the other twin, which you failed entirely to clarify. \nWhat have you done to facilitate that? Anything at all? We know youre taking your son around to buy vintage sports memorabilia, an expensive endeavor at the best of times. Did you take him along to buy her decorations? Why did you make her come with you when she clearly didnt want to be there?\n\nDid you ask her why she's being mean? Why she is pissy? Did you actually listen to her reasons or just scold her? She's clearly bitter about something and punishing your son for it.\n\nAre you just doting on him endlessly and havent helped her?\n\nThe transphobia is NOT okay, at all, but it sounds like you're sweeping your failings as parents under the rug and excusing it as her being Spoiled. She earned her punishment by being transphobic, but just punishing her isn't going to solve this problem. Neither will you being dismissive.", "YTA -- it sounds like you DD knows she is not the favored one.", "ESH\n\nHer for the transphobic comments, and against her brother\u2019s gf even!\n\nYour parents for butting in on your parenting. \n\nYou for making your TEEN daughter and son share a room together. Teens need privacy, and if they can\u2019t get it, well (1) maybe you should\u2019ve stopped sooner, and (2) then house them with siblings of the same sex/gender instead of by age.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Idk where you got the idea they have separate rooms", "Yes. People in crisis need help, not to be a punishment for a shitty teenager", "No, she should be exposed to people in the LGBTQ+ community who are mature enough to not be offended by what she says and to show her that they are just regular people.", "Best to sit down and talk to her plus explain why she is wrong in hurting others. Communication may be able to resolve some issues.", "No. I think there are communications issues which parents (including from personal experience with my own late ones ) need to address.   \nExample: my late parents thought I was always malingering as a kid when I complained of always having palpitations and feeling cold, until I collapsed in school and the hospital ran tests only to discover that I was suffering from a genetic condition which was never addressed. They were not bad parents too, given how well I turned out. \n\n  \nDifferent parents different parenting styles.", "And those needing help are not teachable moments for shifty people.", "Not even that because people shouldn't be used to punish others.

We only have the parent complaining here and stating they knew why she did it. We didn\u2019t get the details on the why she did what she did. Only that they talked and again no details.   \nLook. The way I see it - if they are omitting details, then we are not getting the full picture of why she acts that way. What we do have is a lot of details about her brother and his gf. \n\nJust not on her acting up the way she did. So if she is a twin, maybe she feels neglected from her twin bro or something, I don\u2019t know.\n\n She is 13. Not 17. Maybe 13 year olds mature quickly on their side of the world than the 13 year olds on my side of the world."]}
