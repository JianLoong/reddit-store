But us all being together is not a good idea. I have an older brother who's 10 years older than me. I adore my brother. He despises the man I call dad. We have the same bio dad, but I was only 3 when he died, and mom remarried a year later. Our dad's brother. My brother hates him because he feels like dad was just waiting for our bio dad to die, to just swoop in and take his place. My dad hates that my brother changed toward mom and him after they married. They argue over everything. Dad's quite the hothead and my brother isn't the most expressive person so bottles a lot up until they argue. Mom tries to get my brother to feel differently about things. Has used some guilt trips on him in the past. Some stuff I only found years later. Like the fact my brother wished a lot of terrible things on dad when he learned I had started calling him dad, feeling he should have discouraged that and made it clear bio dad was only dad and he was just some scumbag who stole his dead brother's family. Then dad became enraged when my brother refused to let him come to his graduation. He told mom she could come alone or not at all but he was not playing happy family.\n\nThe last time we were all together was when grandpa (dad and bio dad's father) died and well... my parents were hurt to learn that my brother had married and had a child and especially hurt that I knew, had attended the wedding and knew my nephew. It became so tense. My parents were upset with me. My brother told them not to be and that he was none of their business. They said they deserved to see their grandson.

My brother said we should come for dinner to celebrate sometime and told me he hoped I had the best wedding. My parents were upset and wanted to know why I'd elope. After enough pushing I told them it was because of the family drama and not wanting to choose between them and my brother. This made them so upset and maybe even angry.

Your parents won't admit their behavior has played a role in your decision, and it's manipulative of them to accuse you of punishing them. Have a wonderful wedding!", "NTA.

That\u2019s the same situation that drove Hamlet to insanity (sans all the murder). \n\nI understand his feelings: If I died and my little sister married my husband and tried to be a mom to my kids- I\u2019d haunt them for the rest of their lives. \n\nAlso, maybe consider if your mom and uncle/dad are such good people after all. You don\u2019t remember your bio dad but your brother does (he was 13 when he died, not a small child with no memory of him like you were) \n\nThey refused to accept his justified anger and hurt feelings and tried to force him to play happy family thereby driving him away. Now they are attempting to guilt trip you into forcing a reconciliation between them and him at your wedding. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there is more to the story.

My husband & I eloped to avoid dealing with family drama which was usually caused by my narcissistic & abusive father. We've been married for 40+ years and I never regretted the decision.
