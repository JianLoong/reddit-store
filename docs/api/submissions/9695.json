That means they didn't get together a year later unless they got married the same day they decided they loved each other. They had to be dating months before to decide to get married and then plan a wedding, or even elope. It's suspicious as hell.", "OP's parents don't seem to respect anyone to be honest.", " \u2b06\ufe0f All of this OP.", "Not even that. They got MARRIED a year later. Unless they fell in love, planned a wedding, and got married in the space of a day, they were definitely dating a lot less than one year after his death. If my mother did this with any man I would not forgive her, let alone with the brother of my dad.", "NTA for eloping but honestly your brother's not wrong. Something feels wrong about your bio dad's brother marrying his brother's wife. I wouldn't want to call him dad either, to your brother that man's a vulture. Then your dad uncle starts fights with your brother who would rather not talk about it? And your mom guilt tripped him? They were wrong for that. Notice the difference in their reactions. Your brother is happy for you and wants to celebrate when you come back, meanwhile your parents are angry and upset because ***they*** feel punished. Your brother doesn't feel punished.\n\nAlso you weren't old enough to remember your bio dad, but your brother remembers him well. If anyone knows better, it's him who saw it all unfold right there. Remember, you didn't even know they guilted him and all that because they hid it. You don't know what they're keeping from you.", "NTA but like, why\u2019d you tell them you were going to elope? isn\u2019t the point of eloping to do it, and then tell them after? source: me, a successful eloper", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the A H here, but I think there is more to the story between your mom, stepdad and brother.  From what you\u2019ve said your brother doesn\u2019t sound super dramatic normally so I think there is something behind his animosity (whether something real or perceived).  Have you ever asked him what exactly thinks happened?  \n\nAll that said, NTA for not wanting your wedding to be a lightening rod for family drama.  Elope and enjoy your day and then plan individual celebrations with each when you return.", "NTA. I\u2019d want to avoid all that drama too.", "OP is mostly like a affair child", "Right\u2026 they got married a year after the dad died. I\u2019ve heard of this happening over a longer period of time to mourning spouses/sibling in laws and them growing closer and eventually falling in love. Even then it can be uncomfortable for some people. But this is way too quick for that. There was definitely some shady business.", "I got married in secret. Just me, him, 2 witnesses & a photographer friend. Then for the \u2018reception\u2019 we had arranged a catch up drink with our friends in London because we\u2019d moved out of the city a year or so before. \nMy wedding day was wonderful. Oh and this was my second wedding & all I remember from the first is how much stress various people caused me. \nA wedding is about you & your partner. Fuck everyone else. NTA.", "You can't force love. How long after your bio dad died did they get together?  I have 5 BIL's ; I can't imagine thinking of any of them as anything but a brother.", "Is that a Hamlet reference?", "NTA at all. That\u2019s a hard choice to make but you made the best one. And you can clearly see who the adult is here considering your brother congratulated you and invited you both to dinner. Whereas your mum and stepdad are whining, taking no responsibility over the reasoning for your choice. \nBut I do think there\u2019s more to this than your mum and stepdad are letting on. I can imagine it must be mortifying for someone to lose their father only to have their uncle step in and completely take over that role. On top of that, they invalidated his pain, blaming him for everything they did wrong. And now they are upset that he refuses to play happy family. That\u2019s pretty messed up. \nYou were very young when this happened so your brother definitely knows more about this situation than you do. If this something you think you want to unpack, you should definitely talk to your brother and get him to tell you everything from his side cos right now all that seems to be happening is your mum and stepdad going woe is me.", "NTA but honestly the way your dad handled things puts me on your brother's side. He hates your brother for being upset that he tried to replace his dad? There's probably a lot that went down that you are unaware of. And the fact that your brother has boundaries and seems to respect yours makes him the better person to me\n\nAlso your mom marrying her husband's brother a year after he died? Is it possible there was overlap and that's why your brother is mad?", "NTA\n\nIf i were you i would invite the brother but that's up to you and you're not an asshole either way", "Light YTA cuz I only know the tiniest context, but it seems you and I both agree with your brother OP, so deep down I think you know maintaining your relationship with the two people that metaphorically spat and peed upon your fathers grave, is wrong. Maybe just don\u2019t invite them? Have your brother walk you down the aisle.", "Agree, those lines stood out to me too.", "My first thought was biblical \u2014 \u201cwhat in the levirate marriage is this?!?\u201d But then I remembered that levirate marriage requires that the deceased brother had no children.\n\nSo, Hamlet it is.", "I found it and going to read it in a bit but thought I\u2019d add a [link to it](https://www.tor.com/2009/03/19/we-havent-got-there-yet/)."]}
