She told her parents, and her parents told my parents. Her parents were adamant on keeping her, while my parents told me that I would be responsible for whatever decision she decided to make. I didn't really want her to keep it at the time, and she didn't want to keep it either, but her mom and dad convinced her to keep it, so she kept it. About two days after she turned 18, she ran away without the baby and left a note saying this wasn't her choice. Our child ended up moving in with me. My dad had died a few months prior to that, and my mom was struggling, especially since I had siblings. My daughter's grandparents ended up being a really good support system for me and my daughter; they helped me out with rent, they encouraged me to go to trade school and helped finance it, and they are a very integral part of my daughter's life. She genuinely loves her grandparents; she begs me to let her go there on weekdays. My daughter is currently 9 years old.\n\nMy daughter's mother came back into our lives in February; she said she wanted to make amends. She had been seeing a therapist who told her she was probably suffering from postpartum depression at the time, and she ran because she felt like there was no other choice, which she felt awful for. I guess I could understand where she was coming from; we agreed that we would get our daughter every other weekend. Just until our daughter feels comfortable, we can revisit that agreement; we have it in writing.Now, where I am questioning myself is here. She recently came to me and informed me that she felt like her parents shouldn't be with our daughter after all they have put her through, and because of their religious beliefs, according to her, they are extremists, which is why they forced her to keep her.\n\nI have never really witnessed anyone being extremist; they have taken my daughter to church at times, but they have never put any crazy ideas in her head. Me and my daughter are very close, and she still tells me when she wants to go to the bathroom (I really don't know why she announces it). And whenever she's upset, she always says she wants to see her grandma or pa because they spoil her. I came to the compromise that I can supervise my daughter's visit with her parents, but I can't just cut her off when she's such an important part of our daughter's life. She got upset and said that I treat her like she doesn\u2019t have a say. I don't know whether I'm being an asshole; it just seems so drastic to cut her parents off from my daughter's life especially when i consider them to be family aswell.", "created_utc": 1687993203, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lnzd8/aita_for_allowing_my_baby_mother_parents_in_my/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Could be valid fears or rose colored fear.\n\nJust because her parents have mellowed out now that doesn't mean they weren't extremist years before. Or maybe they just had \"extremist tendencies\" when it came to their daughter. They raised a troubled child. If they are religious you can probably imagine the arguments they got into. You should remeber how your ex was when she was younger. She got pregnant at 16. I'm sure they put a tighter lease on her after that. Probably made her feel real poor about herself. (You know being a sinner and wanting to kill/abort her unborn baby and all that). That's probably part of the reason she ran off too. \n\nIt would be a mistake for you to let her convince you to cut the grandparents off cold turkey. Just be a little bit mindful. Your daughter is young the full brunt of their ideals might not surface tell she is a teenager.

It's good she's working on improving herself and building a relationship with your daughter, but she gave up the right to make actual parenting decisions when she bailed and left everyone else to pick up the slack. \n\nI would be honest with her about that, too. That you make the parenting decisions at least for a few years until she \"proves\" that she will act in your daughter's best interests, and trying to alienate your daughter from people who love her, treat her well, and are important to her is NOT in her best interest.

Have you generally been in agreement with them so far about all the important decisions? You may not know what they act like if/when someone defies them on something they think is important.\n\nAlso look at how traditional their church is.

Everything that is important for the kid, you will decide, not her. She maybe was not happy with her parents, but she just left and now can't just decide that she wants to play mom again now the kid is older.", "Yeah, this is complicated, but you know what kind of people they are. **They forced a 16 year old girl to become a mother against her will.**\n\nNo crazy ideas in your daughters head, eh? Well, they're christians, that's pretty crazy!\n\nI don't know what to do here.", "NTA. Your baby mama disappeared from her child's life and her parents picked up the slack.\n\nYou raised that baby and now she wants to act like she has rights.\n\nAlthough the law might see this differently, I do not think that she has many rights to begin with. \n\nMake it clear that she would have had to be in her daughter's life for a lot longer if she wanted to dictate who can and cannot see her daughter.", "It's a bit too late to make that decision now. They're part of your daughter's life. If she were 2 or so, but at the time of course, mum was AWOL.", "Makes sense to me. Grandparents may be lovely to a sweet little girl and horrid to a teenager with a mind of her own. If she wants to wear ripped jeans, get piercings, and dye her hair, they might sing a different tune. \nOr even just wear jeans, have a pride badge, and cut her hair short. We don\u2019t know where and whether GPs ideal of their granddaughter and the real life kid will clash.", "Yeah people seem to be really glossing over the whole forced birth thing, and deciding mom must just be crazy. Abusive people aren\u2019t abusive to every person in their lives. That\u2019s how they maintain access and status. And also, people are genuinely loving to some people and abusive to others. Humans are complex! Moms concerns should be respected and I think supervised visits and non judgmental processing of family dynamics between baby mom and dad are the move. OP, your daughter is lucky to have a dad so devoted to maintaining a stable loving family for her.", "Those people forced 16 year old to have a child and life for her was so bad she felt the only option she has is to run away.\n\nPeople can be complete garbage to some people while treating others nicely. Keeping the visits supervised isn't bad idea, especially since they're taking her to church. Who knows what goes on when she's alone with them.\n\nIt's possible they're being so nice out of guilt and regrets and want their granddaughter be their re-do child.", "This is the sanest comment here. It's not a simple black and white of mum ran away sh has no right. She was forced to give birth at 16. By her parents. Religious or not what they did to her was horrendous. She left as soon as she legally could. She was still a child herself.\n\nHer parents are not necessarily good people because they helped. Maybe they regret what they did, maybe they just love their granddaughter, or they're still the same and would start imposing on the little as she grows up. What happens if this child ends up with an unwanted pregnancy when she's grown up. Will they be her support system or would they browbeat her? \n\nOP has to think about the long term for the sake of his daughter. Doing that doesn't mean he's giving his ex what she wants.", "Absolutely agree re custody.", "After so many years away OP may know the parents better. The child's mother views them as these awful people who forced her to own up to her mistake. She is still viewing them from a pregnant teenager POV. \n\nWhereas OP has seen them grow, change and love him and his daughter for 9 years. People change who they were nearly a decade ago doesn't mean they're the same now. They lost their daughter over their religious beliefs, there's a chance they aren't AS religious now.", ">I agree, except OP should have his ex-gf\u2019s voice in the back of his head, and just watch for weirdness as his daughter grows up.\n\nThis. It's possible that the grandparents regret their own parenting mistakes and have genuinely changed. It's also possible that their more extreme views won't be noticeable until after OP's daughter hits puberty. Either way, it's worth keeping an eye out for changes in the currently-beneficial dynamic.", "Please make sure that the grandparents who forced a sixteen year old to have a child aren't the guardians in case anything happens to you."]}
