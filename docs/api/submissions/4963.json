We told her it's fine, but she should ask us for clarifications. Her mom talked to us about this matter. She told us it's probably because someone was doing her tasks for her. We thought it's unfair and suggested to let her do her parts, so she'd learn and not be too dependent. She laughed it off and continued to pay someone. With that, we decided to return her work and pointed out the mistakes.\n\nDuring our last term, we had to write a research paper. She was grouped with me again. I was stressed out since my group for this sucked so much; I only had one member I could rely on. Regardless, I still gave her a simple task to be considerate. The task I gave her was to write the limitations of our study. I explained everything to her that all she had to do was to organize them into paragraphs. I even voice messaged her the details and instructions. She and her mom kept saying they got it. Hence, I let them work on it while I was busy with other parts.  However, when they finally handed me her part, it was word-for-word copied from another study. I was so done and angry that I didn't reply to them. Instead, I went to our Prof. to ask if I could remove her from my group and just give her a special task or something. My Prof. agreed to take care of it after I told him everything. I basically snitched on her, but I couldn't care less back then since I was barely surviving the term. I didn't hear anything from her mom, but my classmate was still friendly toward me, so I thought we're good. \n\nBut, one day, the mom visited us with thank-you gifts. She gave everyone presents except me. I was so embarrassed when she walked past me; some of my classmates were also dumbfounded since I was the one they used to message and call when they have questions. \n\nMoreover, they began sharing/posting self-pity stuff on Facebook. Their comments under those posts were also indirectly about what I did, so I muted them as I was starting to feel guilty. Not long after, my classmate stopped messaging me as well. This made me felt so bad about what I did, but my friend said I wasn't wrong. I believed her. \n\nNow, 2 years later, one of my friends sent me a screenshot of the guardian's comments about my blind classmate stopping college because she was \"traumatized\" after her classmate (me) treated her like \"sh**\" and made her feel \"worthless\" in her first year. \n\nI kept telling myself I wasn't wrong, but when I tried to remember what I did, I couldn't help but feel like crap and think I'm one of the reasons why she stopped.

Unless the class material is specifically catered to team building or management or something, wtf is the point", "This is one of those times when I wonder if posting a response will help. The former classmate is basically slandering OP on social media.", "NTA!!!\n\nShe risked you and your friends grade, and she didn't do the work herself. She didn't deserve a passing grade. She didn't do the work. Being blind does not make someone incapable of doing basic research or writing a paper. \n\nTell your friend this:\n\n\"I have worked with X on more than one assignment. Each time, she plagiarized. When we discussed the issue with her and her mother, they not only admitted to the plagiarism each time, but acted like it wasn't a big deal and continued to give us plagiarized work. We then had to redo everything to avoid an academic integrity investigation and failing grade. When she plagiarized again on this assignment even after I gave her all the information she needed--and she verified it was enough--I knew that her behavior would not change. She would keep plagiarizing and risk getting us in trouble with the university. So I discussed the issue with the professor. It had nothing to do with her disability, and everything to do with her repeated plagiarism, which threatened the whole group.\"", "NTA - Being blind doesn\u2019t justify plagiarism", "NTA. You don\u2019t mess around with plagiarism. It\u2019s one thing to produce work that\u2019s not up to par but plagiarizing? That\u2019ll get you kicked out of college real quick.\n\nHonestly whenever I had a group project I\u2019d warn the other members that I was not gonna take a hit on my GPA for them. \n\nJust because she is blind doesn\u2019t give her an excuse. Seems like you were super accommodating and understanding but you hit her limit. Definitely don\u2019t feel bad about it. You did the right thing", "NTA", "NTA.", "Nta at all.", "NTA. She absolutely could have done everything correctly and herself. I had a good friend during my college years about twenty fucking years ago, and she had SO many affordable or free accessibility tools available to her, she was very independent and educated. You basically ended her skating by on other people\u2019s work and she realized she didn\u2019t want to do her own.", "I'm partially blind (one eye) and have been in university with a blind person, also a deaf person too. They did their work and didn't plagiarize, that is a no-no in any situation. \n\nThe people dropping you for her will understand when it comes time to get a job in the real world. You don't let people slide like this. I think you handled it very well. Which is the point of group work to be honest. It's knowing how to communicate with other personality types but knowing when to bring in your boss. You did the right thing here OP. Don't doubt yourself here. \n\nNTA.", "Being blind doesn't mean someone is incapable of completing coursework! \n\nI, mean, helllloooooo, Helen Keller, anyone!!!!!!???? \ud83d\ude09\n\nNTA, obvi", "NTA. OP, you did the right thing, stop obsessing about it. Part of having a disability means that it's a reason, not an excuse. I'm dyslexic, so it takes me A LOT longer than other people to produce the same thing they can do in a much shorter time. That meant I had to work harder than other people in college to hold my own. That never meant people were frustrated with me and felt like my work was of a lower quality.\n\nEverything about this situation tells me the mom was butting in too much with her kid and that her kid wasn't ready for college. You didn't get her kicked out, she couldn't handle it, and her and her mom just don't want to accept it.", "Yeah. This really isn't about her being blind. She could have had her mom read her the instructions or researched it on her computer (presumably she has software that reads her text) and done the assignment correctly. NTA", "The only utility I can see for them is in large lecture classes (like 100 students) where the professor simply can't read that many individual projects. Putting people into groups makes them do the writing and research portions of the course (which are often required by the department) without expecting the professor to grade several hundred to a thousand pages in a short time frame. Especially if they teach multiple large lecture courses.", "How is this shoving accommodations onto the students? I'm not meaning to sound confrontational, I just don't know what you would expect the professor to do that is extra. The accommodations the student would need have nothing to do with what actually happened. The student would need software that allows them to perform research, write papers, and communicate with group members. There is software that exists for these exact purposes. It can read the content of websites and email. I don't want to pretend that there would be zero additional challenges, but there's nothing preventing the student from engaging in group work.", "NTA. Being blind doesn't give you a pass to turn in crappy or outright plagiarized work. She probably didn't leave because she was \"traumatized,\" she got caught plagiarizing again and most schools will not let you do that shit even once, let alone twice.", "NTA.  Your grade (and future) was on the line.  She\u2019s dead weight.  An unfortunate situation you got caught up in.", "Nta. You tried multiple times to get her to do a small amount of her own work. Just because you\u2019re disabled doesn\u2019t mean you should receive a degree without having actually done the work yourself. It\u2019s likely the next person who didn\u2019t shelter her would have caused the same issue\u2026this is down to her parents not raising her to stand on her own feet, not the fact that you eventually had to protect your own academic achievements.", "NTA. It\u2019s the school\u2019s responsibility to provide the student with any accommodations and it\u2019s clear this was weighing on you. Most schools don\u2019t excuse plagiarism, blind or not, because you KNOW it\u2019s not you work or your words. It seems like the people around her have limited her by allowing others to do the work for her instead of providing her with the proper resources to succeed. Sorry this is still haunting you years later.", "NTA.\n\nYou told the truth to a teacher about one group assignment. The teacher investigated and handled it, you did not decide what the consequences for her would be.\nAlso, you don't fail at an entire education for only failing one group assignment. So that can't be the only reason she failed.\nShe (and her mother) committed fraud, that's not your fault either. But this offcourse is not something they are willing to share with the world... It looks like they need a scapegoat and decided to \"use\" you as such.\n\nYou might want to post your side of this story on social media (responding to the mother), if you have not already. That is...blocking ten and ignoring it all together could also be the best way to handle this.\n\nI feel for this girl. Because she was most likely stuck between her mother (that pushed her to commit fraude) and classmates that did want her to actually...you know...work and study. I can see that being traumatizing. But you are not the cause here. Not at all. This is caused by the mother who put her child in a horrible position. I wonder if she realizes it.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nShe was incapable or unwilling to do the work, and she faced the consequences of her actions - she was treated no differently to a fully sighted classmate who had not been pulling their weight in a group task. If anything you have her far more leeway and consideration than you otherwise would have.\n\nUltimately you have to protect yourself, and if the work of one particular classmates would likely result in you losing marks and dropping grades (or worse), then you need to sort out that problem.\n\nIf a classmates has a disability that affects their work, then consideration and appropriate accommodation needs to be given for that at the class level, not placing that burden on to other students.", "Nta. She couldn't do assigments. That's why she quit. It's not your fault. \n\nThey are TA to give everyone a present exept you", "I studied university with a blind girl and have a deaf sibling and something I\u2019ve learned from my experiences with both is that we like to believe they\u2019re stupid, but most of the times they\u2019re able to have a normal life, specially if given the tools they need to develop their skills, which has been an eye opener for me, since I see their efforts to do good in life despite what we see as big setbacks (but for them it\u2019s just everyday life). \n\nWith that said, she can be blind and not good at school, one it\u2019s not tied to the other and I\u2019m pretty sure my friend would agree with this, being blind doesn\u2019t excuse plagiarism, weren\u2019t they paying someone to do this? If so they also got ripped off. This is so cringe omg. NTA.", "NTA - they did not stop because of you specifically. the stoped because they were not able to do the work. You were just the probably first one , that did not cover for them.", "Always report cheaters, and have no sympathy for ones whose cheating would have taken you down with them. NTA", "NTA. Why did others not step in to help her? How was she your responsibility? People are making excuses for her and being unfair to you. Don\u2019t stress over this.", "Plagiarism varies from institution to institution. The kindest is an automatic fail. The college I work in, it\u2019s instant expulsion. I wonder how they knew you put in the complaint, unless you told them yourself?", "It sounds like after a couple of years of having someone else do her work, it was finally catching up to her.  She either realized that she hasn\u2019t learned the fundamental material and she couldn\u2019t progress academically, or she was in a situation where no one was able to do the work for her.  She could have also gotten caught plagiarizing, was being expelled, and tried to save face by blaming OP."]}
