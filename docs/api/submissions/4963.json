{"id": 4963, "submission_id": "zo8iqd", "title": "AITA for removing a blind classmate from my group?", "selftext": "During my first year in college, we had a blind classmate. We always made sure she was involved by assigning her parts when we had pair/group works. The tasks were something she could handle (we asked her first if she could do it). However, her work was often wrong, so we had to redo her parts. At first, we accepted them and explained the errors. She said she'd do better next time. We told her it's fine, but she should ask us for clarifications. Her mom talked to us about this matter. She told us it's probably because someone was doing her tasks for her. We thought it's unfair and suggested to let her do her parts, so she'd learn and not be too dependent. She laughed it off and continued to pay someone. With that, we decided to return her work and pointed out the mistakes.\n\nDuring our last term, we had to write a research paper. She was grouped with me again. I was stressed out since my group for this sucked so much; I only had one member I could rely on. Regardless, I still gave her a simple task to be considerate. The task I gave her was to write the limitations of our study. I explained everything to her that all she had to do was to organize them into paragraphs. I even voice messaged her the details and instructions. She and her mom kept saying they got it. Hence, I let them work on it while I was busy with other parts.  However, when they finally handed me her part, it was word-for-word copied from another study. I was so done and angry that I didn't reply to them. Instead, I went to our Prof. to ask if I could remove her from my group and just give her a special task or something. My Prof. agreed to take care of it after I told him everything. I basically snitched on her, but I couldn't care less back then since I was barely surviving the term. I didn't hear anything from her mom, but my classmate was still friendly toward me, so I thought we're good. \n\nBut, one day, the mom visited us with thank-you gifts. She gave everyone presents except me. I was so embarrassed when she walked past me; some of my classmates were also dumbfounded since I was the one they used to message and call when they have questions. \n\nMoreover, they began sharing/posting self-pity stuff on Facebook. Their comments under those posts were also indirectly about what I did, so I muted them as I was starting to feel guilty. Not long after, my classmate stopped messaging me as well. This made me felt so bad about what I did, but my friend said I wasn't wrong. I believed her. \n\nNow, 2 years later, one of my friends sent me a screenshot of the guardian's comments about my blind classmate stopping college because she was \"traumatized\" after her classmate (me) treated her like \"sh**\" and made her feel \"worthless\" in her first year. \n\nI kept telling myself I wasn't wrong, but when I tried to remember what I did, I couldn't help but feel like crap and think I'm one of the reasons why she stopped.

Yeah they are blind, but plagiarism would have gotten you an F. And possibly suspended or expelled. And that's what happened. You didn't pick them out of the group to be mean to. Their work was shoddy at best.", "NTA. Frankly if this ex-classmate is still badmouthing you *two years* after the incident\u2014in which a professor, not you, took action against her\u2014I\u2019d wonder if you have a legal case against her for slander.", "NTA. You accommodated her disability by giving her a task that should have been within her capabilities. She chose to cheat. That\u2019s not on you. \n\nIt sounds like Mom is super overbearing and that\u2019s part of her problem. She was used to being treated with kid gloves and at one sign of adversity she stopped? Yikes. That child needed to get out from under Mom and grow on herself.", "NTA\n neither her or her mom were ready for college.\nBeing blind had nothing to do with it.  Her mother had a different kind of blindness and could not see what she was doing.", "As someone who is disabled, NTA. Her mom is really doing your former classmate a disservice.   Mom failed as a parent", "NTA.  College professor here.  I hope you understand that she plagiarized, and that the consequences can be severe, not only for her, but for the whole group.  I've taught at three colleges over the years and in all three, penalties for plagiarism range from zeros on an assignment to an F for the course. When it happens more than once, the student can be expelled.  The fact is that she knew she plagiarized and was willing to let the rest of the group suffer the consequences if the assignment was submitted.\n\nThat said, someone who's so lazy they're willing to steal someone else's work doesn't deserve consideration.  Regardless, if she dropped out of college because of you she shouldn't have been there in the first place.", "NTA. It sounds like she was dependent on people doing things for her. And when confronted with her inability to complete her assignments, she didn\u2019t know how to deal. Honestly I think her mom (or parents) are likely the enabling AHs, as they seem to be trying to work around her handicap, vs learn how to live and work with it. And I think the professor was an AH - how do you have a blind student in a group and not check in with the group to see if any accommodations are needed or any difficulties are encountered that young people may need help managing.", "NTA, cheating is cheating. Being blind is no excuse to buy your way into a degree.", "NTA NTA NTA...  plagerism is not something to play with when you're in school. I'm honestly wondering if the mother was doing the work for her, and was offended after the daughter got called out for the work being shit.", "NTA! Just because she is blind does not give her a pass for not doing her own work. She is not only messing with her own grade but yours as well. Mom seems like she has sheltered the daughter all her life. She probably expects everyone to just accept whatever work she turns in. Go on about your life, and forget about her.", "NTA. She was paying someone else to do her schoolwork? Am I understanding that right? But it was still done wrong anyway? That's a school ethics violation right there. All she needed was dictation software.\n\nAnyway, even if I'm misunderstanding that part, you're still nta. Group work is meant to teach you how to pull your weight, not to constantly carry someone else who isn't pulling theirs. The mom brought thank-you-for-helping-my-pitiful-baby gifts to a college class? That's demeaning to her blind daughter. I don't see how any of mom's behavior will help the daughter to be independent as an adult, especially after mom dies.", "Nta. Your blind classmate had so many red flags on why you wouldn't want to her be part of a group with you - but being blind had nothing to do with it. So let's stop calling her your blind classmate and let's call her something else. Like lazy classmate. Cheating classmate. Incompetent classmate. Plagiarizing classmate.\n\nJust the fact that you had to know and interact with her mother on the work is enough.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Do you mean that the mom was paying for someone to do the girl's work?  If so, it's the mom who let her down, not you.  If it was the girl who was paying someone else to do her work, she brought the trouble on herself.  You had nothing to do with it.  \n\n\nNobody who's letting her get away with not doing her own work or who's making people feel pressured to be nice to her (like the mom who is coming to her college classroom and giving gifts to her classmates) is doing her any favors.   She's not a child.  She's a grown woman.    \n\n\nAll you did was hold her to the same standards of honesty as you would any other classmate, sighted or not.  That's real respect.  I've had blind classmates and they'd much prefer that over some sort easy work/high grade/unnecessary special treatment given out of pity.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
