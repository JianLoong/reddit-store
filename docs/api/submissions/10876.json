Before I had even met Ellen I made a promise with my dad to take Mila in if he couldn't care for her, which is something I discussed with Ellen before she even moved in, and she had no complaints then.\n\n\nMy dad fell ill four months ago, and of course I took Mila in. He is not getting better, so he asked me to officially adopt her and I agreed. Ellen was furious that I made this decision without consulting her, despite me having told her about the arrangement in the past. Although I feed, walk, groom and manage all of Mila's needs, financially and otherwise, Ellen said she had to 'put her foot down' on this issue.\n\n\nI asked Ellen if there were any specific\u00a0 reasons she was so opposed us keeping Mila, and she stated the following:\n\n- She said that since she works from home full time (whereas I'm closer to 50/50) that I can't understand how much having a dog around affects her work (she makes clay art, crockery, that sort of thing)\n- Having a dog is expensive, and it will be a drain on our finances (which are not joined, I'll note, and I've paid for everything so far)\n- It will make it more difficult for us if we ever want to have a child\n- Our house is not huge, so it doesn't make sense to have a big dog like Mila\n- She has friends who have severe dog hair allergies, and she doesn't want them to feel they can't visit anymore\n\n\n[None of her complaints had anything to do with any bad behavior. Mila does not jump on people or furniture, bite, bark at visitors, she will follow commands to leave a room if they're given to her etc.]\n\n\nI see that these are reasonable objections to not taking Mila in but I stayed firm in my position. Ellen said that if I loved her, I would make other arrangements, and at this stage I was getting a bit angry so what I said next may have been a little harsh. I told her \"Love has nothing to do with this. My first responsibilities are my dad and Mila, and nothing you say will convince me to send her away. If you seriously can't cope with that, you can get out of my home.\"\n\n\nEllen burst into tears at this and left to go stay with her mom, citing that I clearly need time to 'think this over'. A bunch of her friends who know me have been telling me that I'm a total AH for prioritizing a dog over my girlfriend of nearly three years, but my own friends have been telling me to stand my ground. Ellen has been radio silent, has not come home and is not responding to my texts. So I guess I'm looking for some unbiased opinions on the matter.

This is not a new issue. All successful relationships/marriages are based on compromise. You communicated this to her before and she understood. This isn't some random dog. At this point with your father falling ill, it could actually be a therapy dog too, when you visit him. Knowing that his dog is being taken care of by his son surely feeds his spirit during this difficult time and for your gf to use this as a \"If you love me\" moment and make you choose? She lost and she should have. And she'll use this line in the future too, which is extremely manipulative. I've been with my husband for close to 24 years and neither one of us has ever said that. If you break now with that line, be ready for her to use it over and over, just to get her way.", "NTA. You clearly communicated the plan prior to her ever moving in. On top of that, does she consider the REASON you\u2019re taking in the dog, the illness of your father. It\u2019s pretty inconsiderate for her to make this situation about her when you\u2019re doing a solid for your sick dad.\n\nIf you already had a dog before she moved in, would she not have moved in? Would she have told you to give up your dog? I don\u2019t think so!", "Nta! And you said she knew about this arrangement with your dad. While I only understand one of her reasons and that\u2019s her work, the rest the dog wouldn\u2019t affect as long as it\u2019s properly trained.

Like, she can do her work in a room Mila doesn\u2019t have access to. \n\nShe gave you an ultimatum that was not fair. You were honoring a promise that you had before you met Ellen and she was aware of and agreed to the promise. Now she\u2019s complaining.

Regardless of who the AH is you\u2019re going to want to sort this out with Ellen or prepare to lose your gf over this arrangement. You basically told her straight up my dad and my dog mean more to me than you do. That\u2019s probably why she is so upset.

She gave you her approval to have the dog just to turn around and throw a tantrum  when you followed through. Her statement saying that if you loved her, you\u2019d get rid of the dog is SO manipulative and wrong.", "NTA - one thing to consider is that dogs are very emotional and Mila is likely very sad to be missing your dad. Throwing her into a stranger's home would further traumatize her and could lead to depression. Dogs are also tough and she'd likely bounce back, but rescue dogs usually go through a lot. The fact your gf doesn't even consider this is telling. I don't know her, but I would hesitate to raise a child with someone so cold hearted.", "NTA -  You made a promise and you talked to her about it.  It wasn't an issue because she never thougt it would happen.\n\n\"If you love me blah blah blah\" - That is emoional  manipulation.  That one comment alone would make me tell her to take a hike.  People that use that are manipulative - dump her, keep the dog.  With this comment she is showing her true colors.", "A dog is expensive and will drain your expenses but a child won't? Keep the dog ditch the manipulator", "NTA. \n\nIt sounds like she never wanted the dog around to begin with, but just agreed with whatever you said in order to move in. She probably thought that once she was living in your home, you\u2019d become so enthralled by her that you\u2019d do whatever she said. Boy, was she in for a surprise. \n\nHer reasons are flailing, and show that she\u2019s just trying to spew out whatever she can think of, and hoping something will stick. When that didn\u2019t work, she resorted to the, \u201cIf YoU lOvE mE\u2026\u201d garbage. \n\nYou have one father. Girlfriends will come and go. \n\nWhy would you want to have a child with someone who doesn\u2019t like dogs, anyway?", "NTA. You pay for the dog and the dog is well behaved. If your girlfriend had an allergic reaction, it would've been different. I'd say the dog stays, if I were you I would do the same.", "NTA\n\nThe dog is family.  She deserves to be treated like a princess. Either ditch the GF or have a proper sit down discussion where you state you are not going to give up the dog but is there anything that could make life easier for her - the GF that is.", "NTA from your description of the situation.  This agreement predated your relationship, you pay for everything, etc.  The only leg she has to stand on is potentially the dog hair/allergy issue, but again, she agreed to it beforehand.  Guess she found out her ultimatum didn't work.", "NTA, in my experience dogs often help to bring out the true nature of people.\n\nAllergic here btw, I love visiting people with dogs though because I can just pop a pill and enjoy giving scratches and cuddles for a few hours, sorry to all my friends for being too focused on the four leged friendo sometimes...", "NTA\n\nIf she loved you, she would understand that you are giving your sick father peace of mind by providing a home to his beloved pet when he is not well enough to take care of her himself something she knew may happen prior to you living together.\n\nIf she loved you, she would respect you keeping your promises to someone you love as it shows that you only make promises you can keep.\n\nWhy is it more important that her friends can visit over you keeping your promise to your dad?\n\nIs your home the only place she can see her friends with allergies, or can alternative arrangements be made so she can spend time with them?", "NTA your gf is a spoiled brat.", "NTA \nMila was a part of your life and you made commitments to her and your dad before your gf was even a possibility. You were open about this commitment from the beginning, if your gf had ANY issues with the possibility of living with a dog then she should have said something then. \nHer \u201creasons\u201d may seem valid at first glance, but they are more like excuses and grasping at straws. The only one that I MIGHT consider valid is the friends with allergies, but I still say those friends can either take an allergy pill once in a while depending on the severity of the allergy, or oh well they just don\u2019t come over and gf can visit them elsewhere.

There are things that should have been agreed on, like how is her work space going to be impacted and measures put in place to mitigate that, who's looking after Mila when you're not at home, who's going to pay for large vet bills, boarding fees if you go on holiday etc. \n\nIt's not that these are insurmountable problems, it's that you showed a complete disregard for her right to have input as the other half of the couple living in this home. You're treating her as if she's a guest who's staying there for a night. In fact, you'd probably treat them better than this as you'd ask if they have allergies or issues with dogs.\n\nIt might be your house, but this is also her home.

If that's not something she can cope with, that's unfortunate but I don't know if I can break my word", "Respectfully disagree. Dad and son could perfectly have had a conversation about \"what if something happens to me\". Not everybody dies in old age. There's disease, disability, a million things that not necessarily are dependent on age and age only. Yes, one would expect that if nothing bad happens, the average person will reach 80yo or whatever and the dog would be long dead by then. But the thing is that life is unpredictable. \n\nAnd according to her objections...I don't see them that reasonable considering their circumstances. \n\n-If the finances are not combined yet, the dog isn't putting a dent on her bank account so as long as OP is okay paying, she has no right to complain about that. The promise preceded the girlfriend so in this case, that comment makes her sound entitled to me.  \n\n-Having a dog makes having children harder. Yes, that's why there are only dogs in childfree houses. \n\n-She needs her space to work. Okay, perfectly fair, close the door. Like you would to if it was kids and you're a parent working from home. \n\n-Her friends can't visit because they are allergic. --- What a shame! Let's get rid of a dog who already came from a rescue, who right now is separated from her original owner but at least with his son, and send her back to the shelter or give her to strangers just so some people can come home and have coffee once a week if not less.

Now that the dog is here, as previously agreed upon, she doesn\u2019t want it. Pets ARE family.", "tentative NAH? She doesn\u2019t want a dog. You do and it\u2019s good that you\u2019re keeping your promise to your father. She knew about it in advance. She\u2019s kind of the AH for getting so upset about it when it seems like you\u2019ve been reasonable but also it just seems like she\u2019s not a dog person.", "Nta. Keep the dog, say goodbye to the girl.", "NTA: get a new girlfriend \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 dogs are family and you agreed on keep the pup if anything ever happened.", "Keep the dog, ditch the gf.  She is not an empathetic or kind person.", "NTA keep the dog and leave the girlfriend.", "NTA because you did specifically discuss this with her-- before she moved in. She doesn't get to get angry that you are doing the thing you specifically told her you were going to do. You went above and beyond to acknowledge and discuss her concerns, even if you did ultimately veto them. It shows that you've thought through the ramifications of having a dog. The one thing I can understand is that a large dog in a small space will be disruptive to pottery, especially if she doesn't have a separate work area. So she needs to set up a work area away from the dog, or if that's not possible, crate the dog or put her in another room for a few hours. Mila will be fine.\n\nI don't do these kind of ultimatums. I would choose the dog too, but not because I love her more than my partner. One, you made a commitment to your father and are honoring it. Two, she was informed prior to moving in and made no objections, three any kind of ultimatum like this feels inherently manipulative and I am inclined to cut my losses and run. If she's willing to \"put her foot down\" over this issue, which she agreed to in the first place, when else is she going to put her foot down? \"If you love me you'll...\" is a statement almost guaranteed to get me to cut someone out of my life. How about if you love me you'll stop trying to force me to do what you want me to do?\n\nGetting a big dog is a big responsibility, so I do hope you are being forthcoming when you say you are responsible for all of her needs. Just know that if Ellen comes home, she will be 0% responsible for taking care of Mila. Maybe make it clear that you expect her to do the bare minumum like give Mila food or water and let her out to pee if you're going to be gone for a long time. But all of her care and costs are on you. This is your dog.", "Firstly, I'm sorry about your dad OP; I sincerely hope he manages to get better. You're NTA and if I were you I'd definitely be single after that ultimatum. Not only had Mila been living with you guys for months you're keeping her as part as a promise to your SICK FATHER. As you said Mila's not a poorly behaved dog and she knows to leave the room when told, Ellen's not paying for any of her expenses, and for the past few months the size of the house hadn't been an issue so far. If the dog hair was a problem for her friends with dog allergies what have they been doing before that couldn't be continued long term.\n\nAt my old job at my local SPCA we tried out best to keep the dogs happy and healthy but we were too understaffed to properly tend to enrichment needs and the shelter environment just naturally stressed the animals out sometimes. I could never imagine giving up a pet, regardless of how I came to own it, just because my partner suddenly had a problem keeping them at our home.\n\nEllen saying you didn't love her if you kept Mila is a clear cut example of her trying to manipulate you and I'm glad you didn't fall for it. Yes what you said might've been harsh and it's good that you recognize that but I can't blame you, your father's sick and having her try to pull that shit was only going to make the overall stress of the situation worse. I hope things work out for you two but she needs to understand that you have a promise and responsibility with your dad and with Mila; a dog wasn't a responsibility that cropped up out of nowhere and Ellen still moved in knowing that your place becoming Mila's new forever home was a likely possibility if something happened to your dad on way or another. Her suddenly protesting it out of nowhere is bizarre enough on it own, even more so considering she bears what seems to like NO responsibility in Mila's care.", "NTA!! She is manipulative and childish.. if she needs her own space she can get her own space.. don\u2019t let her bully u into getting rid of Mila.", "Nta, gf sounds like a brat though.", "Not only is it a promise Ellen knew about, rehoming an older pup might end up being difficult, and it would be unnecessary torment for your sick father. \n\nHer concerns are valid - but if she felt so strongly she should have brought them up when you first took the dog in, giving you time to find work-arounds and still accommodate Mila. What was said in the heat of the argument was unfortunate though, and I hope things work out. \n\nBut, NTA even if you keep the dog over the gf.", "NTA. Your gf's objections are stupid", "NTA, but this should be a lesson to anyone playing house. Don't move into someone else's house and start acting like a spouse without the commitment.", "NTA. If she loves YOU, she would understand why this is so important to you.  My husband recently took in his mother\u2019s after she passed away.

You told Ellen ages ago that Mila might become part of your family.  She agreed.  Mila moved in four months ago and Ellen didn't object.  It's your house, your rules, your promise to your dad and Mila.  If Ellen thinks your place isn't big enough, she can move out.  That way, you and Mila will have plenty of space.  The only thing you need to \"think over\" is whether you want to reposition Mila's dog bed once Ellen's things are out of the way.\n\nOh, and for what it's worth, you can meet some very nice people (okay, women) walking Mila or taking her to a dog park.  One of my friends met his wife at the vet's office when he took his rescue pup (part St. Bernard) in for a checkup.  Okay, yeah, his wife IS the vet, but you get the idea.  What I'm saying is, there are women out there who will accept you and Mila both.  Honestly, the fact that you're taking care of her because of your promise to your dad will be seen as a plus by most women (I'm a woman so I kind of know these things) because it shows you are serious about honoring your commitments.\n\nCall Ellen.

Keep the dog, ditch the girlfriend.\n\nAlso, dog tax", "NTA\n\nHaving a dog in the house because she works at home is just her resentment over having Mila there, not that Mila interferes with her work. You pay expenses for Mila and she resents that too. Demanding Mila be sent away is cruel, Mila is not a young dog and chances are no one would take her as their new family member. Plus you made a promise to your Dad and most important, Mila is family, a pet yes but our pets are our family.\n\nWe have two Huskies who are indoor dogs, housetrained, sometimes underfoot when we do projects around the house yet we don't get resentful that they interfere in our daily lifestyles.\n\nPlease don't let your girlfriend, her friends or family convince you Mila needs to leave your house.", "NAH.

And she knew about it before she moved in.", "`Ellen said that if I loved her, I would make other arrangements, and at this stage I was getting a bit angry so what I said next may have been a little harsh.` \n\nThat was a super, super, super, unacceptable, manipulative thing to say. Like I get it, there are some relationships I've been in where I've felt like hey, you keep doing this thing that is hurting my feelings, and if you loved me, **you would find a way to work through this with me** (not just do what I want)**.** But, IF I ever even said that, it would be MONTHS after trying to work through and talk about it. \n\nWhat you are doing is not actively affecting her. You are taking care of the dog and being responsible. The finances do not fall on her. The dog is well-behaved. \n\nThe two of you have not tried to work through it or find a point of compromise. She did not suggest you do that. And it's revealing that the quote above is basically the first thing she jumped to when she didn't get her way in the situation. \n\nThis is a hard situation. Your dad is sick. She should be trying to make things easier for you. And to try and find a point of compromise regarding the dog, especially since she knew about the dog ahead of time. \n\nYou were reacting to her trying to be manipulative, being emotionally insensitive, then make it seem like you're doing something wrong when you're not, and get away with it. Did you handle it in the best way? Probably not. But I think her approach to this is fundamentally flawed, self-centered, and callous. \n\nIf you give in on this, that sets a not great precedent, imho. \n\nLastly, love is not a zero sum game. You can love her, the dog, and your father all at once and try to do right by each of them. Just because you're trying to do right by your dad, doesn't somehow mean you don't love her. And that's what I mean by dangerous precedent. I would be wary of anyone who would view a relationship in this way and think that they need to be my priority in all situations, all the time, despite reasonable actions and other priorities that pop up. If she actually cared about you, she would understand this and try to come to some sort of compromise. Not strong arm into what SHE wants.\n\nI wish you the best of luck. NTA.", "NTA.

She was taken to the pound then passed from home to home of family and friends until after his funeral was over. That's when my parents took her in and kept her until she died a couple years ago. \nShe refused to go for walks, go in the car, play with toys, or even just go outside in general. She would sit outside his bedroom and cry for him while pawing at the door, hide under beds, or stick her head under pillows and cushions. And she attached herself to my dad because he had retired and was always there for her 24/7. He was already familiar, but he was her saving grace. She was put on antidepressants, anxiety medication, behavioural therapy to help her get outside. As our family healed, she healed too and lived the rest of her days as a happy girl.

I took Mila in, I arranged things for Mila, I did this, I did that. It should have been \"we\" took Mila in, \"we\" arranged things. You two live together. \n\nYou're refusing to acknowledge that from the beginning you approached this as if you are living on your own and completely excluded Ella from the decision making process. Has it occurred to you that she wanted to be included and help because she loves you and she feels your relationship is serious enough for you to see this as a \"we\" situation? That your insistence to keep everything separated only achieved to make her think you're not as serious as she is? Your single minded attitude just made her resentful and probably sees the dog as the reason why her happy relationship glow is gone, or a chore that has been forced on her. \n\n>I have compromised to the best of my abilities\n\nAre you 100% certain? You take care of Mila's needs, but who is handling the extra cleaning required because of her? I don't know what breed she is, but does she shed? If yes, then that must be an issue for Ella in her working area. Even if Mila doesn't go in there, dog hair sticks to everything. So are there any improvements to be made along this line? \n\nIn regards to her friends, they can take antihistamines when they visit. But also, there are other mitigation measures. Regular vacuuming, wiping surfaces, leather sofas instead of fabric, no Mila on the furniture. If she's used to being on the sofa, maybe you could get her a doggy sofa of her own so she doesn't feel excluded, and ban her from the human ones. If you have rugs, you can change them for washable ones like the Ruggable ones. My life completely changed after getting those. \n\nYou said she doesn't jump on people etc, but if the house is small and you don't want to isolate her just in one room, try filling kong toys with foodstuffs Mila likes and freeze them. She can have one when the friends visit, and it will keep her occupied for hours. Same when Ella works, it would keep Mila busy so Ella can focus. \n\nAlso, is she comfortable with large dogs? Not comfortable as in she can be around one when other people are there, but is she comfortable handling Mila on her own, giving commands and seeing them through? Does she know how to handle Mila when she misbehaves? If not, have you arranged any opportunities to improve their relationship, like obedience training, breed specific training, agility etc. \n\nThere are so many other things that could be done, I'd be here until tomorrow writing it all down. But the point is, you can only figure out what could work if you stop approaching this from the \"I\" perspective,  and see it as a joint project for both of you. You live together, Mila should be both of yours to look after. \n\n>Please stop demeaning her, or implying that I demean her. \n\nI didn't demean her, you did even if you didn't mean to do it. My husband live with me for a while when we were dating, then I lived with him, then we chose a place together. It never ever crossed my mind to suggest he had any less right to make decisions in our home than I had, and vice versa. You went straight there, so ask yourself why you felt the need to hit below the belt like that. \n\nYou want to make amends? Then apologise for that part unreservedly. Then discuss how you **both** screwed up by issuing ultimatums, and both of you should have communicated **with** each other, not **at** each other. You should have involved her in finding solutions/compromises from the begging, and she should have communicated her unhappiness with you rather than blame it on Mila. \n\nIf it's too late and she's unwilling to compromise now, then I agree, you should  break up with her rather than abandon Mila. She isn't at fault that her humans can't talk to each other, and she's been through enough by having to leave your dad behind.", "Yea she can.

I didn't 'approach' this situation, it was thrust upon me. I didn't take in Mila thinking about me, I took in Mila thinking about my dad\n3. As I mentioned in my post, I take care of all Mila's grooming needs, that includes managing shedding (but, as I said above, she doesn't jump on furniture, so it's rugs and carpets only). If that was an issue, I'm sure Ellen would have mentioned it\n4. I have not tried to \"keep things separate\" as you say. Ellen has simply shown no interest in caring for Mila, the most she will do is pet her when they're in the same room. She has every opportunity to walk, feed, groom, or otherwise care for her and has not. Nor do I expect any of that of her, if it's not a responsibility she wants to undertake\n5. I know for a fact that Ellen knows how to and confidently commands Mila, I've seen her do it. You are continually bringing up arguments that Ellen has not. If these were issues, I'm sure they would have joined the list that she made for me, but you're simply digging for problems where they don't exist. Mila is not a puppy. She is well behaved, and if she acts out I will obviously get her more training but she has not. None of Ellen's issues have been related to Mila's behaviour\n6. You are demeaning her, by making up arguments on her behest because, what? You don't think her own issues are good enough? At no stage have I claimed that her objections were invalid, simply that they were ones I could not change. Is there some reason you can't accept that they are fine, and don't need modification to be valid?\n7.

Unless she's one of those rare ones that's aggressive towards kiddos (and larger dogs tend to be more nurturing and protective towards infants) having a dog is actually a positive. Studies show that children raised as infants with dogs living in the home with them have FEWER allergies and auto-immune disorders as children and as adults, and are less likely to develop allergies to dogs and cats as well. They also have healthier immune systems. It's almost as though the dogs we've evolved along side for the past 30,000 years are...beneficial. :-)\r  \n\n\n* Our house is not huge, so it doesn't make sense to have a big dog like Mila.\n\nShe's already in your life, she's 6ish, and there are things called yards and walks. The size of the house is really not that relevant, unless the house is extremely tiny or just absolutely ginormous, as doggos need to be walked anyway, and I'm sure you're doing that. As Mila is a mature doggo, I'm sure she can hold it while you're at work as well, if your GF is absolutely going to be a butt about things, but there are doggie doors and poo/pee pads if absolutely necessary, even doggie doors controlled with chip collars.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* \rShe has friends who have severe dog hair allergies, and she doesn't want them to feel they can't visit anymore\n\nThat's actually too bad. They can socialize somewhere else or figure something out regarding how clean the house needs to be or allergy meds. A home without a doggo is just sadder than a home with. Honestly, this is the only argument she made that's not easily dealt with, but it's not that valid because she just doesn't have to socialize with them in that home that's somehow too tiny for what, a 60- 70 lbs dog, but not too tiny for 100-200 lbs humans. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFrankly, I think she just doesn't like dogs, and is jealous of your doggo. And also quite frankly, for me, one of my absolute dealbreakers in a relationship, like TOTAL dealbreakers, is that I will not consider a relationship with a woman who does not want a dog in our shared home. I grew up with dogs in the home, and while I don't currently have a doggo since my last one passed away (I wish they lived longer), it's on the agenda.

If we were dealing with a child instead of a pet, would your opinion be the same?

I would not, however, take it as a given since she said she was thinking it over. She might decide that being with you and the dog is better than being without you. You let her know the condition that you might be adopting your dads dog prior to her moving in. Either she accepts the whole package or she moves on. Whichever one it is, it is her choice. You are the one that has to look in the mirror every day and see either a person who lived up to their word or a person that bailed on their promise to their chronically ill father. You are not the asshole, you are the person with integrity.", "NTA.  And honestly I think you need to seriously consider what you have learned here - Ellen is a liar and a manipulator, you really, ***really*** do not want to get married to, let alone have children with, such a person.   Anything she promises cannot be relied on for a moment longer than it's convenient for her, and when she breaks her word, she will try to make it your fault or pressure you with reasons why it's ok for her to dishonor it. \n\nI cannot advise you strenuously enough: this incident is profoundly revealing about her character and how she would treat you if you got married or had kids.  This long in is a painful time to find out, but much, *much* better now than after taking on the legal obligations that attach to marriage or children.  Sorry dude.", "Anyone who would demand you get rid of your sick father\u2019s beloved dog is a horrible, selfish person. Especially when she\u2019s long known this was the deal. DUMP HER.", "I knew a potter with dogs, cats and geese.", "Hair burns out in the kiln! Lol you can\u2019t really have \u201chairy\u201d pottery. Source: me. A potter with 4 pets who are in and out of my garage studio.", "She could see her friends other places.", "Ok\u2026.it must have been edited. The \u201cN\u201d wasn\u2019t there when I initially read it\u2026or my glasses malfunctioned.", "Oh I agree that setting the condition \"it's me or the dog\" is fine, because that informs OP of what her boundaries are (I won't live with the dog) and still allows OP to freely make a choice. But by using the phrase \"if you really loved me...\" she is trying to play on OPs emotions to get him to \"prove\" he loves her and thus influence his decision to do what she wants. OP can want to keep his word to his dad AND still love his gf, it's not an either/or situation, but phrasing the choice like she did comments on OP as a person vs. her boundaries, i.e. if they don't chose me, they don't REALLY love me and (by default) were lying about actually loving me\n\nEdit: words are hard", "My uncle brought a German Shepherd back from WWII. He would not let anyone ignore a crying baby. He would run back and forth between crib and adults as if to say \" go take care of her\"", "Pet tax, please!", "This was 100% the rottweiler we had when I was growing up. So many people would act all horrified when my mom mentioned having a rottweiler around her kids and she was like ummm that dog loves my kids more than anything and keeps them safe. She still laughs about how on car trips, if we had to stop for gas, she'd bark at the gas station attendant (even when she knew them) if my brother and I were in the car. If it was just my mom and our dog in the car, she'd barely lift her head, lol. She was such a good girl. I still get teary eyed like a dope whenever I see rottweilers.", "NTA\n\nKeep Mila, return Ellen to her mother.", "ESH - She moved in knowing that your dog was a possibility.\n\nYou are not prioritizing your dog over your girlfriend.  She's prioritizing not having the dog over you.  \n\nThat said, the way you said it was tacky and likely means this won't end well for your relationship, which is a shame.", "NTA. You're keeping a promise you made to your dad, that you GF was aware of and voiced no objections to when you told her. Personally, I couldn't date a woman that was against having a dog. The dog is part of the family. She should have expressed concerns with you when you first told her it was possible this would happen. But she basically lied to you, so you'd let her move in. Now that she lives with you, she feels she can \"put her foot down.\" You should see this as a huge red flag regarding her character. Give in to her on this, she will start pushing boundaries everywhere.\n\nAnd of course her friends are calling you the ah. They're her friends, so of course they're going to side with her. Their opinions are irrelevant.", "NTA. She knew of the agreement prior. You're not joined in finances. You are paying, you are handling the responsibilities for the dog. If she is concerned she should have her own place. You don't just go back on your agreement with your dad. She's throwing a fit and trying to manipulate you to get her way. Stand firm on your promises to your dad and Mila.", "NTA\nKeep the dog!!!", "NTA you had to stand your ground and say the harsh truth instead of dancing around on the idea of Mila not being there, you\u2019re a good person with a good heart, as for your girlfriend.. not really", "NTA. You did everything right. You told her ahead of time about a very important commitment. You stuck to it. And you stayed strong when she attempted manipulation. The \u201cif you love me\u201d almost made me scream out luck. You are a good son, a good soul, and hope you end up happy.", "NTA. Byeee Ellen. You\u2019re dodging some future bullets.", "Keep the dog. Dump the GF.\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nShe knew before she moved into your house that you would honor the agreement with your dad. It wasn\u2019t something sprung on her. \n\nIt is your finances that are covering everything and it is your house the dog is living in. The fact gf seems to feel everything that is yours is now \u2018ours\u2019 is where she went wrong as she has nothing to put her foot down about. \n\nLikely her moving back with her mother or where ever she wants to live is the best solution here.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry this relationship hasn\u2019t worked out.  However I think you need to find a woman who appreciates a man who honors his commitments. \n\nDo hope your dad gets better.", "Ellen is a Biotch! You deserve better.", "NTA. She knew up front and was fine but suddenly when it happens, she gives you an ultimatum in your house. Give you time to think things over, yes please think your relationship over.  Keep the dog.", "NTA you made a promise to your father, you let her know the deal before she moved in and she is now trying to guilt you into doing what she wants in YOUR home. She pays for nothing and she came second so she gets no say!", "okay all the people saying shes a manipulator are fricking nuts lmao. people can change their minds when they are faced with a reality they dont like. the real problem here seems to be that OP is considering this a solo venture when his gf will obviously have to be involved in some capacity. hes saying its only his money he is spending so it doesnt matter, its his house so it doesnt matter. bro they live together? who cares whos name is on the deed its essentially their house!!! its her home too? he let her know about this a long time ago apparently. okay but why didnt he tell her when it actually happened? its weird to not be like hey so im taking in my dads dog (for whatever reason). we will now have a dog! he says her reasons arent unreasonable but he still doesnt care. so the real problem is that he doesnt care about his gf\u2019s opinion or comfort. he is willing to throw away a 3 year relationship over a dog. if you are willing to throw away the relationship over a dog (which she obviously realized during your confrontation) thats fine! thats your personal bottom line. but it seems the gf was actually taking into account long term circumstances that included the two of them as a team and he sees himself as a solo act. im not surprised you havent gotten any contact from her she is probably heartbroken you dont value her more than your dads dog. (side note i love dogs. i loved my dog RIP, but i would get someone else to take care of the dog if my bf didnt want to live with it and had reasonable objections) people on reddit are SO SEVERE! calling her a manipulator and a gold digger essentially because she doesnt want a dog at home. YTA for being a bad bf and not communicating with your life partner and roommate about a huge life change and commitment that you WILL BOTH have to deal with.", "NTA  \n\n\nKeep the dog, lose the girlfriend. Her reasons are not reasonable. The only one I'll give her is working from home and having the dog in the way, but they make dog gates and pens for just this reason. It really sounds to me like your GF just doesn't want a dog and is trying to guilt you into getting rid of her. I would stand my ground just like you did. You made a commitment to your dad. You're honoring that commitment. Though, even if you hadn't made that promise, I'd still think she was  an asshole for trying to unload a dog you clearly want.", "NTA. If your father doesn't recover, Mila will be his living memory for another 7-10 years.\n\nI hope your dad does recover OP. So you both can look back on this and laugh how you dodged a bullet.", ">Love has nothing to do with this. My first responsibilities are my dad and Mila, and nothing you say will convince me to send her away. If you seriously can't cope with that, you can get out of my home.\"\n\nI don't think it matters at this point because you dumped your girlfriend already. If you would rather keep Mila, that's okay. She's allowed to change her mind (or she could have lied) and you are allowed to break up with her over it. This response was warranted per her behavior.", "NTA. Maybe I will be alone forever, but I will always put my pet over any partner, so I'm biased.\n\nMila is a dog, she wouldn't understand why she was abandoned -yes, she belongs to your father, but I'm sure you were part of her life too. Your girlfriend is a grown woman capable of understanding the promise you made to your father and the warning you gave her before she moved in.", "Wooo buddy. Let her go. So she lied about being ok with the dog in the future to move in and now she\u2019s \u2018putting her foot down\u2019? No. And you aren\u2019t putting the dog first, you\u2019re putting your dad AND the dog first. Good choice. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear before you ever adopted Mila that this might come up sometime down the road and she was fine with it then, probably because she didn't think it would happen.  She can close the door to work, expenses aren't hers already so that's irrelevant, friends with allergies can meet elsewhere (I have bad dog allergies and own two dogs LOL) and one dog isn't going to make or break living in a small house.  The child thing, she has a point but assuming it won't happen for another couple of years, Mila will be in her senior years and will probably be sleeping most of the time by then anyway (what breed?).\n\nAnyway, stick with Mila, no need to stress your pops while he's not doing well. GFs come and go and if she really wants to make this work, she will come around.", "If my dad had asked me of this (he passed 2 years ago), people would have to walk over my dead body to separate that dog from me. Mila obviously meant a lot to OP\u2019s dad, he specifically asked OP to adopt him, worrying about his future, to chuck him out like that would be an immense betrayal. The GF is trash. NTA OP and don\u2019t you ever even consider it.", "Lol, comment straight out of r/seducingwomen", "I'd also bet dollars to donuts if she changes her mind & is 'ok' with the dog, it will end up dead or missing after she 'accidentally' feeds Mila chocolate or 'accidentally'' leaves the gate open. Dog is not safe while girlfriend is around.", "He should change his locks asap.", "Change your locks. She might try to harm Mila.", "You aren't prioritising your dad and the dog over your girlfriend. You are prioritising your integrity - keeping your word and honouring commitments you made to the people you love. This should tell Ellen that if you made a commitment to her you are the kind of man who would stand by it. Shame she can't see that.", "How has he forced her to do anything?", "Found the girlfriend", "If the dog was such a problem for Ella, why didn't she bring it up before? Four months is a long time to keep all these things bottled up if they were such a problem for her."]}
